Format The game begins with six players and is played in five rounds. In the first round, each player must secretly declare how much money they would like to receive, to a maximum of ¬£25,000. Once the amounts are revealed, the person who has asked for the largest amount is immediately eliminated from the game and receives nothing. Each of the other five is credited with the amount they requested. In each of the next three rounds, the host reads the first few words of a question and invites the players to wager a portion of their totals. Once the wagers are entered, the host reads the entire question and the player who made the largest wager has to answer it. A correct answer adds the wager to their total, while a miss deducts it. Once the host has asked as many questions as there are players still in the game, the leader chooses one opponent to eliminate with no winnings. The totals of all remaining players are then increased to match that of the leader. At the beginning of the third round, each player is given an option to \\"Shift,\\" or force an opponent to answer a question meant for them. Each player can use this option once during the third or fourth rounds. A complete question often leads in a very different direction from that suggested by its incomplete prompt. Example: * Prompt: Which major planet... * Question: Which major Planet Hollywood investor played the lead in the 2000 remake of Get Carter? (Answer: Sylvester Stallone) In the fifth and final round, the two remaining players stand at podiums facing each other in a form of the prisoner's dilemma, with the leader's total at stake. A brief snippet of a backstage interview with each player is shown to the audience, after which both of them must secretly decide to \\"share\\" or \\"shaft.\\" Their choices are revealed to the home viewers, but not to the audience, host, or players, and they are then given a chance to discuss the situation and change their decisions if they wish. Their final choices determine the fate of the jackpot. * If both choose \\"share,\\" each wins half the money. * If one chooses \\"share\\" and the other \\"shaft,\\" the shafting player wins all the money. * If both choose \\"shaft,\\" neither wins any money. Reception The show was dropped four episodes after it started in 2001, and was listed as the worst British television show of the 2000s in the Penguin TV Companion (2006). On 26 March 2012, Pointless co-presenter Richard Osman, writing for The Guardian named Shafted among four of UK TV's worst ever gameshows. International versions =Australia= An Australian version of the show starring Red Symons ran between 11 February to 5 April 2002 on the Nine Network. If, in the final round of this version, one contestant decided to shaft while the other contestant decided to share, the person who shafted would not only win all of the cash, but would get to play in the next game with the title of \\"Master Shafter\\". When the series started, the other contestants knew who the master shafter was, and that person was regularly eliminated first. This was later changed so that the master shafter was not revealed to the other contestants until the very end of the show. The show was axed in April 2002 due to poor ratings. Only one time in the show, two contestants chose to share and won a lot of money. They hugged in the end unlike the other episodes. Also in the Australian version, contestants can bid up to $500 where the contestant who makes the highest bid gets eliminated in the first round. Unlike the British version, the majority of the questions that were asked were toss-up questions. From round two onwards, the current player with the highest amount picks one of the four topics where a set of questions are given out for the contestants to answer. Before this could happen, contestants must make a bid as to how much money they are willing to risk for every question they get correct. If two or more pick the same bid, the one who locked their bid the fastest will get it and the next contestants bid will be $5 less to avoid two or more players having the same bid. During the set of questions, contestants buzz in for a chance to answer and win or lose their bidding amount for every question they answer correctly or not. After this, half of a question is read for the contestants where they must bid an amount to have the right of answering the question. The highest bidder gets a chance to answer it with the second half of that question revealed. After this, the contestant with the highest score has the right to eliminate another contestant. That eliminated contestant has thirty seconds to persuade that contestant to stay in the game. (One time a contestant didn't bother and wanted to be eliminated.) Then the contestant must decide whether to stick with their decision or change their mind, if they change their mind, that contestant is eliminated and gets no say to save themselves. At the end of the round, all contestants have the same amount equal to the leader. =Other versions= Pilots for Shafted were made in seven other European countries as well as in the United States for CBS but none of them got picked up apart from the Russian version.

The DH 108 featured a tailless, swept wing with a single vertical stabilizer, similar to the layout of the wartime German Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet rocket-powered point-defence interceptor. Initially designed to evaluate swept wing handling characteristics at low and high subsonic speeds for the proposed early tailless design of the Comet airliner, three examples of the DH 108 were built to Air Ministry specifications E.1/45 and E.11/45. With the adoption of a conventional tail for the Comet, the aircraft were used instead to investigate swept wing handling up to supersonic speeds. All three prototypes were lost in fatal crashes. Design and development Employing the main fuselage section and engine of the de Havilland Vampire mated to a longer fuselage with a single tailfin and swept wings, the de Havilland DH 108 was proposed in 1944 as a test \\"mule\\" for the DH 106 Comet which had initially been considered a tailless, swept-wing concept.Davies and Birtles 1999, p. 10. Despite the Comet design taking on more conventional features, the value of testing the unique configuration to provide basic data for the DH.110 Jackson 1962, p. 428. spurred de Havilland to continue development of the DH 108. Selecting two airframes from the English Electric Vampire F 1 production line, the new aircraft had unmistakable similarities to its fighter origins, especially in the original forward fuselage which retained the nose, cockpit and other components of the Vampire. The Ministry of Supply named the DH 108 the \\"Swallow\\", a name that was never officially adopted by the company.Winchester 2005, p. 78. The new metal wing incorporating a 43Àö sweepback was approximately 15% greater in area than the standard Vampire wing. Control was based on the conventional rudder in combination with elevons that were part elevator and ailerons, fitted outboard of the split trailing edge flaps. Although the Vampire fuselage was retained, as development continued, a revised nose and streamlined, reinforced canopy were incorporated.Jackson 1962, p. 429. Testing The first DH 108 prototype, serial number TG283, utilising the Vampire fuselage and a 43¬∞ swept wing, flew on 15 May 1946 at RAF Woodbridge. Designed to investigate low-speed handling, it was capable of only 280 mph (450 km/h). The de Havilland Chief Test Pilot Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., son of de Havilland company owner-designer Geoffrey de Havilland, gave a display flight in the DH 108 during the 1946 Society of British Aircraft Constructors (SBAC) airshow at Radlett.Watkins 1996, p. 39. In later low-speed testing designed to clear the rear fuselage at high angles of attack, the first prototype was fitted with longer Sea Vampire landing gear.Watkins 1996, p. 42. The second, high-speed prototype, TG306, with a 45¬∞ swept wing incorporating automatic leading-edge Handley Page slats and powered by a de Havilland Goblin 3 turbojet, flew soon after in June 1946. Modifications to the design included a more streamlined, longer nose and a smaller canopy (framed by a strengthened metal fairing) facilitated by lowering the pilot's seat. While being used to evaluate handling characteristics at high speed, on 27 September 1946 TG306 suffered a catastrophic structural failure that occurred in a dive from 10,000 ft (3,050 m) at Mach 0.9 and crashed in the Thames Estuary. The pilot, Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., was killed in the accident. Early wind tunnel testing had pointed to potentially dangerous flight behaviour, but pitch oscillation at high speed had been unexpected. The subsequent accident investigation centred on a structural failure that occurred as air built up at Mach 0.9, pitching the aircraft into a shock stall that placed tremendous loads on the fuselage and wings. The main spar cracked at the roots causing the wings to immediately fold backwards.Watkins 1996, p. 40. VW120 in flight, about 1949 After the loss of the second prototype, VW120 became the third and final prototype based on the newer Vampire F.5 fighter built at Hatfield. It differed from the first test aircraft in that it featured an even more streamlined pointed nose and smaller reinforced canopy (lowering the pilot's seat allowed for a more aerodynamic canopy shape to be employed). Power-boosted elevators had been specified as a means to control the pitch oscillations at the root of the earlier disaster. A more powerful Goblin 4 of 3,738 lbf (16.67 kN) thrust had the potential to push the DH 108 into the supersonic range. VW120 first flew on 24 July 1947 flown by John Cunningham, the wartime nightfighter ace. Considered an important testbed for high-speed flight, VW120 was readied for an attempt at the World Speed Record then held by a Gloster Meteor at 616 mph (991 km/h). The second prototype, TG306, was a \\"backup\\" for the attempt before it fatally crashed. On 12 April 1948, VW120 established a new World Air Speed Record of 604.98 mph (974.02 km/h) on a 62-mile (100 km) circuit. Then, on 6 September 1948, John Derry is thought to have probably exceeded the speed of sound in a shallow dive from 40,000 ft (12,195 m) to 30,000 ft (9,145 m). The test pilot Captain Eric \\"Winkle\\" Brown, who escaped a crash in 1949, described the DH 108 as \\"a killer\\". In 1949, VW120 put on an aerial display at Farnborough and scored third place in the Society of British Aircraft Constructors Challenge Trophy Air Race before being turned over to the Ministry of Supply and test flown at RAE Farnborough.Winchester 2005, p. 79. It was destroyed on 15 February 1950 in a crash near Brickhill, Buckinghamshire, killing its test pilot, Squadron Leader Stuart Muller- Rowland. The accident investigation at the time pointed, not to the aircraft, but to a faulty oxygen system that incapacitated the pilot.Winchester 2005, p. 79. A coroner's report published in the local newspaper one month later confirmed that the pilot died from a broken neck. The failure of the left wing as the plane dived, occurred just above the garage at Brickhill. This failure was presumed to be the source of a \\"bang\\" described by witnesses at Brickhill. Swishing sounds which were reported came from the aircraft spinning at a high rate due to it having only one wing. It came down in the woods, after glancing off an oak tree: traces of the impact were still visible 50 years later. The airframe and right wing were dismantled by the military, and removed very quickly. The left wing was also recovered from the fields just north of Brickhill. A nearby German field worker ran over to the crash site and was met by the mechanic from Brickhill garage who had rushed to the crash site in his car to offer assistance. The pilot was already dead. In 2001, a search at the crash site by a local, using a metal detector, was successful. He found some of the mounting bolts \\"cone shaped\\" that were removed when the remains had been dismantled on-site. The tree that the DH 108 had hit was also found, with the scar still visible. The earlier theory, that a faulty oxygen system was the cause, was ruled out by the coroner in his later report. Finally, on 1 May 1950, during low-speed sideslip and stall tests, the first prototype, TG283, was lost in a crash at Hartley Wintney killing the pilot, Sqn Ldr George E.C. Genders AFC DFM. After abandoning the aircraft at low altitude in an inverted spin, his parachute failed to open in time. In all, 480 flights had been made by the three Swallows. Legacy The DH108 established a number of \\"firsts\\" for a British aircraft: it was the first British swept-winged jet aircraft and the first British tailless jet aircraft.

Ant Farm's work often made use of popular icons in the United States, as a strategy to redefine the way those were conceived within the country's imagination. The group Doug Michels and Chip Lord initially met in 1968, when Michels gave a guest lecture at Tulane University, where Lord was attending school. The two met again in August 1968 at an architecture workshop directed by Lawrence Halprin in San Francisco, and It was here where the two founded Ant Farm.Mellencamp, Patricia. \\"Ant Farm Redux: Pyrotechnics and Emergence.\\" Journal of Film and Video 57.1/2 (2005): 40-56. The group's initial goal was to reform education, but with little funding, Michels and Lord relocated to Houston, Texas, where they both became visiting professors at the University of Houston. It was in Houston where the group first began putting on performances, including their \\"inflatables.\\" Mellencamp, Patricia. \\"Ant Farm Redux: Pyrotechnics and Emergence.\\" Journal of Film and Video 57.1/2 (2005): 40-56. Eventually, Lord and Michels were joined by Hudson Marquez and Curtis Schreier. The group was a self-described \\"art agency that promotes ideas that have no commercial potential, but which we think are important vehicles of cultural introspection.\\" In addition to their architecture works, the collective was well known for their counter-cultural performances and media events, such as Media Burn. Their installation, Cadillac Ranch, remains an icon of American popular culture. Alt URL Ant Farm disbanded in 1978 when a fire destroyed their San Francisco studio. Doug Michels went on to design the unbuilt statue The Spirit of Houston. Chip Lord retired from teaching in 2010. Although he is retired, Lord is continuing his work in film and digital media. Doug Michels died on June 12, 2003, at Eden Bay near Sydney, Australia due to an unfortunate accident‚Äîjust 17 days before what would have been his 60th birthday.  Historical context  The free speech movement and the antiwar demonstrations in San Francisco heavily influenced the group Ant Farm. In 1967, the group partook in the Summer of Love in San Francisco. They embraced the youth cultures' communal living, sexual freedom, hallucinogenic drugs, and utopian ideals. In addition, they adapted the do-it-yourself ethos of the Whole Earth Catalog in their work. The Bay Area became the center of new art forms, such as performance and video. Ant Farm gravitated to these new forms and began incorporated it into their work. Like many other avant-garde artists, the group was determined to build outside of the conventional architecture. In the early years of their collaboration, Ant Farm sought out to create an alternative architecture suited to a nomadic lifestyle. The architects Buckminster Fuller, Paolo Soleri, and utopian Archigram inspired their early works of the giant inflatable structures. Projects =Inflatables, 1971= Ant Farm traveled America with a tour of \\"architectural performances\\" during which the group unfurled its anti- architectural Inflatables - inexpensive, portable shelters made of vinyl that provided the stage for lectures and \\"happenings.\\" Anyone who wanted to make an inflatable could buy Ant Farm's Inflatocookbook. The inflatables expressed the Ant Farm's ideals for fluidity and freedom. Their \\"aim was to develop the perception of the body in space while working through the pleasurable and anxious feelings prompted by social interaction\\" thumb House of the Century (Alvin and Marilyn Lubetkin House), Mo-Jo Lake, Texas, South and North Elevations Ant Farm, Richard Jost, Chip Lord, Doug Michels 1971-73 =House of the Century, 1972= In collaboration with architect Richard Jost, Ant Farm designed and built a Futurist ferro-cement residence. The house is noted for its curvilinear and organic shapes, inspired by the Apollo 11 lunar landing. In 2004, the group described the house as \\"a ruin\\", and in 2006, Dwell architecture magazine stated that the house was \\"partially submerged in a Texas swamp\\", but Chip Lord corresponded that it was not, but was \\"undergoing a renovation supervised by Richard Jost, working with the owner\\". As of 2009 it was still a private residence, reported as being somewhat overgrown, surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. =Cadillac Ranch, 1974= In Amarillo, Texas, Ant Farm half-buried a row of 10 used and junk Cadillac automobiles dating from 1949 to 1963, nose-first in the ground, at an angle corresponding to that of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The installation is set up to the west of Amarillo near Interstate I-40 on the famous former Route 66. =Media Burn, 1975= Ant Farm began planning Media Burn while in Houston. Michels and Lord were interested in having the event sponsored, and first proposed Media Burn to the Walker Art Center; however, the art center did not want to sponsor the event, nor did any one else that they asked, so Michels and Lord began selling merchandise to support the event, in order to \\"[use] capitalism to smash capitalism,\\" as described by Michels. Planning for Media Burn lasted six months, because the duo wanted it to be \\"more than a spectacle.\\" Lewallen, Constance, Steve Seid, and Chip Lord. Ant Farm, 1968-1978. Berkeley: U of California, 2004. pg 72-73 It was on July 4, 1975, when Ant Farm performed their \\"ultimate media event.\\" This event involved crashing a modified 1959 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible‚Äîit sported Eldorado side trim, hence it is routinely mistaken for an Eldorado Biarritz‚Äîknown as their \\"Phantom Dream Car,\\" through a pyramid of televisions in the parking lot of the Cow Palace in Daly City, bordering San Francisco. Prior to the main event of crashing the car through the stacked televisions, Doug Hall, whom was presented as President John F. Kennedy, gave a speech in which he presented the \\"Phantom Dream Car.\\" Lord and Michels designed the Phantom Dream Car to appear futuristic, and have an \\"Apollo element;\\" meaning, they could only enter the vehicle's cockpit by crawling in, and their communication would be controlled by radio. Additionally, Lord and Michels would be dressed as astronauts while driving. Doug Hall's speech also addressed what Media Burn believed to be issues with mass media saying, \\"'What has gone wrong with America is not a random visitation of fate. It is the result of forces that have assumed control of the American system...These forces are: militarism, monopoly, and the mass media...Mass media monopolies control people by their control of information... And who can deny that we are nation addicted to television and the constant flow of media? And not a few of us are frustrated by this addiction. Now I ask you, my fellow Americans: Haven't you ever wanted to put your foot through your television screen?'\\" An article written by George McGovern for Rolling Stone about mass media's power directly influenced the content of this speech. Footage from the live event is presented in conjunction with news coverage of the event, in which many reporters say that they \\"don't get it\\" and even that they \\"don't ... wanna get it.\\" Media Burn offers critique of the prevalence of television in American culture and \\"the passivity of TV viewing\\" through the collision of two symbols of Americana: the Cadillac and the television. Similar critiques of television's growing cultural influence were popular among other early video artists. As a group, Ant Farm was concerned with \\"reality,\\" and how it is defined by the media because of the trust that the public instills in television. Media Burn directly addresses mass media's control by limiting their presence in the piece. In the video, no real reporters were not shown conducting interviews in order to create a freer exchange of information, which was commonly employed by Guerrilla Television artists at the time. Doug Michels, himself, said that by \\"using TV to destroy TV,\\" they were working within the theme of Guerrilla Television: to \\"destroy the monopoly of centralized television.\\" =The Eternal Frame, 1975= 1975, 23:50 min, b&w; and color, sound A re-enactment of the assassination of John F. Kennedy as seen in the Zapruder film. Done in collaboration with the media art collective, T. R. Uthco (Diane Andrews Hall, Doug Hall, Jody Procter). The Eternal Frame focused on this event as a crucial site of fascination and repression in the American mindset. \\"The Eternal Frame is an examination of the role that the media plays in the creation of (post) modern historical myths. For T.R. Uthco and Ant Farm, the iconic event that signified the ultimate collusion of historical spectacle and media image was the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. The work begins with an excerpt from one of the most iconic and significant film documents of the twentieth century: Super-8 footage of the Kennedy assassination shot by Abraham Zapruder, a bystander on the parade route, which is one of the very few filmic records of the event. \\"Using those infamous few frames of film as their starting point, T.R. Uthco and Ant Farm construct a multilevelled event that is simultaneously a live performance spectacle, a taped re-enactment of the assassination, a mock documentary, and, perhaps most insidiously, a simulation of the Zapruder film itself. Performed in Dealey Plaza in Dallas ‚Äî the actual site of the assassination ‚Äî the re-enactment elicits bizarre responses from the spectators, who react to the simulation as though it were the original event. \\"The grotesque juxtaposition of circus and tragedy calls our media \\"experience\\" and collective memory of the actual event into question. The gulf between reality and image is foregrounded by the manifest devices of Doug Hall's impersonation of Kennedy and Michel's drag transformation into Jacqueline Kennedy. Hall, in his role as the Artist- President, addresses his audience with the ironic observation that \\"I am, in reality, only another image on your screen.\\" \\"In the uncanny simulation of the Zapruder film, however, the impersonations are not as apparent, raising the question of the veracity of the image.\\" =Media Van= As they traveled the United States, Ant Farm drove in the Media Van, a customized Chevy complete with a bubble skylight for videotaping road side scenery. In 2009, Ant Farm revived Media Van for an exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) titled \\"The Art of Participation: 1950 to Now\\". The Media Van had electronic connections that allowed the public to upload images, videos, and songs onto the van's hard-drive. The van was then sealed, like a time-capsule, with a scheduled reopening in 2030. = Other works = * Pillow, 1969Beischer, Thomas G. \\"Ant Farm 1968-1978 by Ant Farm.\\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 64.3 (n.d.): 367-69. : University of California Press on Behalf of the Society of Architectural Historians.

Transferring these videos from VHS to DVD is very important in order to preserve the work yet these new technological substrates create a historical distance from this earlier mode of viewing. What complicates this issue further is that some of the videos have been reedited multiple times, therefore their ambiguous status can be problematic from the perspective of historical scholarship.Scott, F.

The home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the museum recreates 19th-century life along the White River. The site has a Fishers postal address but has resisted attempts to be annexed by nearby cities in order to preserve the heritage and historic land. History and development baseball demonstration at Liberty Corner The property and William Conner house were purchased by pharmaceutical executive Eli Lilly in 1933 or 1934. Lilly restored the house, and opened it to visitors; it was initially known as Conner Prairie Farm. Lilly appointed resident Vern H. Fisher manager. By 1940 Lilly added several structures to the property, including a still, a loom house and a trading post. After Fisher's 1942 death, Tillman Bubenzer was farm manager until 1977. The farm was unprofitable, and depended on Eli Lilly's support.Allison, David B. (2010). Entertaining the Public to Educate the Public at Conner Prairie: Prairietown 1975-2006. pg. 41. http://hdl.handle.net/1805/2499 In 1964, Lilly transferred the house and its outbuildings to a charitable trust. Earlham College, a Quaker liberal-arts college in Richmond, Indiana, was named as trustee. In transferring the property to the college, Lilly provided an endowment for its operation and continued to offer support with the provision that the property would be open to the public. He also transferred of surrounding farmland to the college, suggesting that Earlham could sell the land and use its proceeds for the museum. Earlham elected to retain the farmland and expand the museum, constructing an 1836 village (Prairietown) with funds provided by Lilly for the purpose. The museum grew in scope and popularity, and attendance increased by 22 percent from 1975 to 1976.Allison, David B. (2010). Entertaining the Public to Educate the Public at Conner Prairie: Prairietown 1975-2006. pg. 72. http://hdl.handle.net/1805/2499 In 1999, tensions began to develop between the board of directors and Earlham about the museum's governance and the college's financial policies. The dispute culminated in Earlham's dismissal of the museum's president and board of directors in June 2003. The Indiana attorney general intervened and, after a lengthy and contentious dispute, a settlement was reached in which Earlham resigned as trustee of the charitable trust, the Lilly endowment was allocated between Conner Prairie and the college, and the museum became independent. Conner Prairie has a board of directors, and maintains its finances and endowment fund. In 2009, it joined the Smithsonian Affiliations program. On December 17, 2010, Conner Prairie received the National Medal for Museum and Library Service and a $10,000 prize in a ceremony at the White House. The museum opened its newest exhibit in June 2011. \\"The 1863 Civil War Journey: Raid on Indiana\\" documents Morgan's Raid with live action, video, and interactive activities. Layout and concept Welcome Center exterior The museum grounds are divided into several sections where different historical eras are recreated in a living timeline. Staff in historical clothing demonstrate the way early inhabitants of the area lived. They explain their lifestyles in character while performing chores such as cooking, chopping wood, making pottery, and tending to animals. Visitors are often invited to join in the activities. The museum's main building, the Welcome Center, contains the entrance lobby, ticket-sales counter, \\"Create.Connect\\" (history and science exhibits), Discovery Station/Craft Corner indoor play area, banquet hall, and gift shop. The gift shop sells pottery made by the museum's costumed staff in addition to more conventional souvenirs. Attractions Conner Prairie has several permanent attractions and a number of semi-regular events, including monthly programs such as \\"Taste the Past\\", a Headless Horseman ride in the autumn, candlelight tours, and a country fair. It hosts American Civil War reenactments, Hearthside Suppers, and Christmas events and dinners. = Create Connect = Create Connect is an indoor attraction, open all year round, that \\"Celebrates Hoosier Innovation.\\" This attraction offers activities such as building a windmill, experimenting with circuits, building a model plane, and building a chain reaction. The area consists of smaller exhibits that explore wind energy at the turn of the century, flight in the early 1900s, rural electrification in the 1930s, and the role of science during the space race of the 1950s-60s. The area is usually facilitated by a blue-shirt staff member, but may occasionally have a first-person interpreter dressed in costume. = Makesmith Workshop = Makesmith Workshop's theme changes through the seasons. In the winter, it focuses on textiles, in the summer, it turns to metalworking, and in the spring and fall it changes to woodworking. Children of all ages can participate in basic trade activities such as sewing on a button, hammering in a nail, or molding a piece of metal. Safety is always Makesmith's number one priority. = Animal Encounters = Animal Encounters is a functioning barn on Conner Prairie grounds across from the Conner House. It houses more than eighteen kinds of chickens, goats, sheep, cows, ducks, and horses. Children and adults can learn about the different aspects of the barn and the animals it houses by using all five senses. The barn will regularly go about activities such as milking goats and cows, collecting eggs from chickens, and shearing sheep. =William Conner House= Built in 1823, the William Conner House is a two-story, Federal-style brick residence on the terrace edge of the west fork of the White River. It is believed to be one of the first brick buildings built in central Indiana. Seven of William and Elizabeth Conner's ten children were born in the home. The house was used as a meeting place for the commissioners, other county officials, and the Hamilton County circuit court of, and contained a post office in the county's early days. See also: David G. Vanderstel, ‚ÄúWilliam Conner‚Äù in Conner lived in the house until 1837. William and Elizabeth's children and their families (or their tenants) continued to live in the house until its ownership left the family in 1871. During the 1860s, Conner's Lenape children with Mekinges Conner (his first wife) unsuccessfully attempted to gain title to the family's Indiana land. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. Subsequent owners lived in the house until 1934, when Eli Lilly Jr. purchased Conner's former farm and the now-dilapidated house. Lilly, president and CEO of Eli Lilly and Company and president of the Indiana Historical Society, intended to restore the house and turn it into a museum. Local architect Robert Frost Daggett and contractor Charles Latham supervised the home's stabilization and restoration and the addition of a six-columned porch overlooking the White River (the porch was removed in a later renovation). Lilly donated the house and farm to Earlham College in 1963, and it became part of Conner Prairie. In 1980, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Conner House has undergone additional restoration, and is preserved as representative of an 1820s home. Its function as a house museum continues to evolve. =1863 Civil War Journey= \\"The 1863 Civil War Journey: Raid on Indiana\\" documents Morgan's Raid, the longest raid of the Civil War behind enemy lines and the most important Civil War event in Indiana. Using live action, video and other interactive activities, the Civil War Journey documents the raid through the eyes of historical figures Attia Porter, Confederate brigadier general John Hunt Morgan and Albert Cheetham. Visitors can walk through a reconstruction of the town of Dupont and be a part of the Civil War; children can board a replica steamboat and play in the water area. The Civil War Journey is set in Dupont, a southern Indiana town which was invaded by Confederate raiders in 1863. Visitors can stop by the Mayfield and Nichols dry-goods store, the Porter family home, a telegraph station, a soldiers' camp and a field hospital. Although much of the Civil War Journey is presented with modern technology, historic interpreters also play a large part in its presentation. Visitors can talk to soldiers from the 103rd Indiana Regiment and residents of Dupont, who share their views of the war and Morgan's raid. Reenactors of Union and Confederate units may be present, painting a more in-depth portrait of the raid. =Prairietown= 1836 pottery wheel demonstration in Prairietown Prairietown is a recreated 1836 pioneer community. Unlike the Civil War Journey, Prairietown is not an actual Indiana settlement but a recreation of what such a settlement may have been like in the early days of Indiana statehood. In addition to several homes, Prairietown has blacksmith and pottery shops, an inn, a doctor's office, a store, a carpentry shop, and a schoolhouse. Visitors arriving early in the day can help with morning chores, and all visitors are invited to play a role in Prairietown society with a character card found at the entrance. Prairietown demonstrates what day-to-day life was like for residents of frontier Indiana. Historic interpreters in period clothing, presenting first-person impressions of the people of Prairietown, offer a unique perspective. Although these interpreters will not discuss events (or inventions) after 1836, blue-shirted museum employees can help visitors approach Prairietown from a modern point of view. =1859 Balloon Voyage= On June 6, 2009, Conner Prairie opened its 1859 Balloon Voyage. Visitors can take 15-minute rides in a tethered balloon to a height of . The balloon is filled with of helium and is tall, making it the world's largest tethered gas passenger balloon. Its gondola can carry up to about twenty people, and the balloon (manufactured by Aerophile) can lift up to 4.5 tons. It is one of five such balloons in the United States. An educational exhibit accompanies the balloon ride, recreating a Lafayette street and including hands-on, interactive elements teaching the historical context and technology of ballooning. The attraction is based on the August 17, 1859 trip by John Wise, who made the first airmail delivery in the United States ‚Äì , from Lafayette to Crawfordsville, Indiana ‚Äì of 123 letters and 23 circulars. Sunset and nighttime flights are made on weekends when the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra plays its Symphony on the Prairie summer series. The balloon ride is weather-permitting, and does not operate in high winds. With the rest of the park, it is open from April to October. =Lenape Indian Camp= The Lenape (Delaware) people have a rich history, and it is on display in Lenape Indian Camp. Conner Prairie recreates bark and cattail-mat wigwams and a fur trade camp with a log cabin, as well as Lenape trades such as pottery, cooking, gardening, hunting, games, beading, weaving, and more. Visitors can learn how the Lenape Indians lived in Indiana, hunting and trapping animals to trade with European fur traders. There are Tomahawk throws once every day and pendant-making once a day in the summer as well as bracelet-making with beads in the winter. = Reoccurring Extras = There are many extra or added permanent exhibits that Conner Prairie offers guests. These include gardens in Prairietown, Lenape Indian Camp, Civil War Journey, and the Conner House, as well as a Loomhouse next to the Conner House. It is also home to many outhouses that are not functioning to this day and merely for display. Summer Camps Conner Prairie offers many different types of summer camps. = Adventure Camp = Adventure Camp offers many daily activities such as archery, swimming, horseback riding, zip-lining, simple cooking, and more outdoor activities. = Science Camp For Girls = Girls can tinker and experiment with science in Conner Prairie's summer science camp for girls. = Science Camp For Boys = Boys can tinker and experiment with science in Conner Prairie's summer science camp for boys. = Archaeology Camp = In this camp, kids can learn about ancient cultures and excavate numerous items throughout the camp session. = Photography Camp = Learn about all the aspects of photography and put together a portfolio of pictures in this camp. = Maker Camp = Make hands-on on projects through the design and innovation process at this camp. = Art Camp = In this camp, use diverse media to create various types of art.  Preschool on the Prairie  Preschool on the Prairie, which opens Fall 2019, will be held in the president's house and will be suitable for children ages 3-5. Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra The museum is the summer home of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. The Friday-Saturday Symphony on the Prairie concert series attracts over 100,000 concertgoers per year, a substantial portion of Conner Prairie's visitor count. There are tables and chairs always set up on the prairie and there is an option to bring a blanket and sit on the grass. Spirit of the Prairie Awards The Spirit of the Prairie Awards, Conner Prairie's highest honors, began in 1998 and honor individuals who demonstrate \\"excellence in achievement, courage, innovation and vision\\".

Ludger Sylbaris (1 June 1874Morgan, Peter. Fire Mountain, , Bloomsbury. New York, NY: 2003. 42-43. - 1929) was an Afro-Caribbean man who was one of three survivors in the city of Saint-Pierre on the Caribbean island of Martinique during the devastating volcanic eruption of Mount Pel√©e on May 8, 1902. Saint- Pierre, known as the \\"Paris of the West Indies\\", was in the direct path of a pyroclastic flow, which destroyed the city and killed an estimated 30,000 people. Sylbaris later travelled with the Barnum & Bailey circus and became something of an early 20th-century celebrity. Saint-Pierre and the eruption Remains of the cell in which Sylbaris survived Ludger Sylbaris was born on 1 June 1874, on the Habitation La Donneau plantation, near the fishing village of Le Pr√™cheur, Martinique, about north of Saint-Pierre. It is commonly believed that his birth name was either August Cyparis or Louis- Auguste Cyparis, but his actual birth record belies this interpretation.Civil Archives of Le Pr√™cheur, Martinique, 1874, record #124, Sylbaris, Ludger Sylbaris worked as a common labourer in the capital city, Saint-Pierre, in the shadow of the volcano Mount Pel√©e. On the night of 7 May 1902, the night before the eruption, Sylbaris got involved in either a bar fight or a street brawl, according to various sources, and was thrown into jail overnight for assault. Some accounts claim that Sylbaris actually killed a man and was thrown into jail for murder, although it is unknown if this is the correct version of events. Many sources indicate Sylbaris was frequently in trouble with the authorities. Some fictional accounts state that he had a precognitive dream and was locked up as a drunk after causing a riot.Dorfman, Leo. \\"The Yawning Mouth of Hell.\\" Comic strip. DC Special Blue Ribbon Digest No.6 - reprinted from Ghosts. Vol. 2. New York, NY: DC Comics Inc, 1981. 26-29. Whatever the cause of his arrest, Sylbaris was ordered to be put into solitary confinement and locked in a single-cell, bomb-proof magazine with stone walls that was built partially underground. The cell did not have windows and was ventilated only through a narrow grating in the door facing away from the volcano. His prison was the most sheltered building in the city, and it was this fact that saved his life. The cell in which he survived still stands today. At 7:52 AM on May 8, the upper mountainside of Mount Pel√©e tore open, causing a dense black cloud to shoot out horizontally. A second black cloud rolled upwards as a column of ash and rock, forming a gigantic mushroom plume that darkened the sky within a radius. The initial speed of both clouds was later calculated at more than . The vertical cloud plunged down the western slope of the volcano, raced down at 161 kilometers per hour, and destroyed Saint-Pierre in less than a minute. The devastated area by the pyroclastic flow covered about , with the city of Saint-Pierre taking its full brunt. The cloud consisted of superheated gases and fine debris, with searing temperatures of over . All of the city's infrastructure was flattened, and almost the entire population burned or suffocated. Four days after the eruption, a rescue team heard Sylbaris' cries from the rubble of the prison. Although badly burned, he survived and was able to provide an account of the event. According to his account, at about breakfast time on the day of the eruption, it grew very dark. Hot air mixed with fine ashes entered his cell through the door grating, despite his efforts in urinating on his clothing and stuffing it in the door. The heat lasted only a short moment, enough to cause deep burns on Sylbaris' hands, arms, legs, and back, but his clothes did not ignite, and he avoided breathing the searing hot air. The only other survivors in the town were L√©on Comp√®re-L√©andre, a shoemaker whose house was on the very edge of the path of the pyroclastic flows, and Havivra Da Ifrile, a young girl who ran from the eruption, got into a boat and survived when she was washed out to sea, unconscious. Later life Sylbaris was pardoned of his crimes and later joined Barnum & Bailey's circus, touring America and recounting the horrors of the explosion. He became a minor celebrity in the process, advertised as \\"the man who lived through Doomsday\\" or \\"the Most Marvelous Man in the World\\". He was the first black man ever to star in Barnum and Bailey's \\"Greatest Show on Earth\\", which at the time was a segregated show. He could be seen in a replica of his cell in Saint-Pierre.Texas Hiking article for Fire Mountain, Sylbaris died of natural causes in 1929. References External links * Barnum and Bailey Poster * Mt.

It is located in the Gower. Moor Lane leads westwards to a caravan park near Rhossili Bay and Burrows Lane leads northwards to a caravan park overlooking Broughton Bay. The village has a scattering of houses, centred on St Cenydd's church, and the King's Head pub. History Llangennith clusters around a central village green and the church of St Cenydd (also Kyned/Cynydd) - the largest in Gower - which was founded in the 6th century, in the days of the undivided Church. According to legend, the church was established as a hermitage by St Cenydd; but in 986 the early buildings were destroyed by Vikings. The present structure dates from the 12th century - it was consecrated in 1102 - when Norman war-lords were building castles and churches all over Gower, as elsewhere in Britain. The large fortified square tower is unusually placed north of the nave in which is a filled in, low, eastern arch, likely associated with a small priory which was attached through the Middle Ages. The church is the reputed burial place of Iestyn ap Gwrgant, the last ruler of the Welsh kingdom of Morgannwg, who is said to have become a religious at Llangennith after being deposed by the Norman Robert Fitzhamon in 1090. The church contains the mutilated effigy of a 13th-century knight known locally as 'the Dolly Mare' and believed to represent a member of the de la Mere family who held lands nearby and a significant Norman font. The church interior was restored and remodelled in the 1880s, and the interior floor raised by several feet to counteract damp. The remodelling was relatively restrained and the church retains many original features. A recently rediscovered medi√¶val niche in the chancel arch displays a significant carved slab of around the 9th century, featuring intricate Celtic knots. This is legendarily the former gravestone of St Cenydd and, until the nineteenth- century remodelling, was set flat in the chancel floor. On the village green opposite the church gates is the reinforced mouth of a natural spring, St Cenydd's Well, on the upper capstone of which are carved faint traces of a cross. A short stroll south of the church is the ruined medieval village of Coety Green. St. Cenydd's Church Llangennith was at one time the most infamous, rough-and-ready village on the peninsula, its villagers referred to in Gower dialect as 'Llangenny Oxen', always the first to rush to any shipwreck, particularly those in Rhossili Bay, and feuding with neighbouring villagers over any plunder they could find. During World War I, when the British government introduced daylight saving, the villagers held a public meeting - and graciously voted to fall in line for a trial period of one month. In the churchyard are buried the Gower folk-singer, Phil Tanner, who died in 1950; and Anthony Eyre DFC (1918‚Äì1946). Physical features The beach is now mainly a centre for surfers and forms the north half of Rhossili Bay beach; the bay stretches for over three miles. Llangennith is a popular surfing location mainly because of consistent swells that accumulate in passage over the Atlantic Ocean. Several surfing schools exist providing lessons during the summer. The beach is backed by sand dunes, and at the north end is the island of Burry Holms. There are gentle walks north-west to the coast over the sand dunes of Llangennith and Broughton Burrows. Sights to watch out for include Blue Pool, a rock pool which, in the right sea and sky conditions, takes a deep blue colour; the natural archway called Three Chimneys; and Culver Hole, a bone cave.

In a paper from 1837, Wantzel proved that the problems of # doubling the cube, and # trisecting the angle are impossible to solve if one uses only compass and straightedge. In the same paper he also solved the problem of determining which regular polygons are constructible: # a regular polygon is constructible if and only if the number of its sides is the product of a power of two and any number of distinct Fermat primes (i.e. that the sufficient conditions given by Carl Friedrich Gauss are also necessary) The solution to these problems had been sought for thousands of years, particularly by the ancient Greeks. However, Wantzel's work was neglected by his contemporaries and essentially forgotten. Indeed, it was only 50 years after its publication that Wantzel's article was mentioned either in a journal article or in a textbook. Before that, it seems to have been mentioned only once, by Julius Petersen, in his doctoral thesis of 1871. It was probably due to an article published about Wantzel by Florian Cajori more than 80 years after the publication of Wantzel's article that his name started to be well-known among mathematicians. Wantzel was also the first person who proved, in 1843, that when a cubic polynomial with rational coefficients has three real roots but it is irreducible in (the so-called casus irreducibilis), then the roots cannot be expressed from the coefficients using real radicals alone, that is, complex non-real numbers must be involved if one expresses the roots from the coefficients using radicals. This theorem would be rediscovered decades later by (and sometimes attributed to) Vincenzo Mollame and Otto H√∂lder.

He was Governor of Massachusetts for one term (from 1854 to 1855), and served for many years on the faculty of Harvard Law School. His history of the early years of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is still considered a foundational work on the subject. Born in Leicester, Massachusetts, Washburn attended Dartmouth and Williams before studying law. After establishing what grew to become a successful and distinguished law practice in Worcester, Washburn entered politics as a Whig. After serving several years in the state legislature, he was elected governor in 1853. Despite his support for a reform-minded agenda, he was swept out of office on the Know Nothing tide in 1854. Washburn joined the faculty of Harvard Law in 1856, where he was a popular and influential figure until his retirement in 1876. His publications, in addition to his history of the SJC, include a history of his hometown of Leicester and numerous treatises on legal subjects. Early life Emory Washburn was born on February 14, 1800 in Leicester, Massachusetts to Joseph and Ruth (Davis) Washburn, both of whom came from families with deep roots in New England.Warren, p. 202Ammidown, p. 219 He was the sixth of seven children. His father died when he was seven years old, and the local pastor, Zephaniah Swift Moore, became a major influence in his early years. He first attended Leicester Academy, and then entered Dartmouth College, where Moore taught languages, at the age of thirteen.Spector, p. 119 He accompanied Moore when the latter moved to Williams College in 1815, graduating two years later in a class of seven; he was influential in establishing an alumni association at Williams, serving as its first president. Washburn then embarked on the study of law, first with Charles Dewey, a Williamstown judge and lawyer, and then at Harvard Law School under Asahel Stearns. Although he did not graduate from Harvard, he was admitted to the bar and opened a practice in Charlemont, Massachusetts. After six months there he returned to his hometown of Leicester, where he practiced until 1828. In that year he moved to Worcester, where he would live and practice for the next thirty years. In 1830 he married Marianne Cornelia Giles, with whom he had three sons and one daughter.Spector, p. 120 Political career Washburn was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1826, serving two terms; his only notable activity was in committee work preparing a feasibility study for a railroad from Boston to the Connecticut River. He was a regular supporter of the Western Railroad in its efforts to develop the railroad westward from Boston.Spector, p. 122 Washburn asserted that railroads could \\"... ward off the attack of any invader.\\" Angevine, R.

Web. 5 Jul. 2016. :Citing Emory Washburn, Speech of Emory Washburn, Delivered in the House of Repre sentatives of Massachusetts, Feb. 14,1838, on the Bill to Aid the Construction of the Western Rail Road (Springfield, Mass., 1838) He would serve in the state legislature again in 1838 and 1877. From 1830 to 1834 he served on the staff of Governor Levi Lincoln, Jr., and in 1841 he was elected to the State Senate, where he served two years. In the second of those years he was chairman of the judiciary committee. In 1844 he was appointed a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, a post he held until 1847.Spector, pp. 122‚Äì123 During these years he also established and maintained what was described by one of his peers, George Frisbie Hoar, as one of the largest and most successful law practices in Worcester County,Warren, p. 203 partnering with John Davis among others.Reno, p. 700 In 1853 Washburn traveled to England to research English constitutional law. While he was away, the Whig Party nominated him as its gubernatorial candidate; he did not learn of his nomination until his ship reached Halifax, Nova Scotia.Spector, p. 124 In the election he defeated Henry W. Bishop (Democrat) and Henry Wilson (Free Soil) with 46% of the vote. Since a majority of votes was at the time required to win, the election was determined in the state senate.Holt, pp. 786‚Äì787 Washburn was the last governor elected in this fashion (plurality voting was enacted in 1855);Formisano, pp. 334‚Äì335 he would also be the last Whig governor.Holding, pp. 77‚Äì79 During his one year in office, he successfully promoted and enacted significant pieces of legislation on a broad social welfare agenda, including measures concerning debt relief, assistance to the poor and insane, and financial aid for female medical students. Henry Gardner defeated Washburn in the 1854 governor's race. One major event that took place during Washburn's tenure was Anthony Burns' arrest and trial under the terms of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. The case galvanized anti-slavery activists, who protested outside the courthouse and sought both legal and extra-legal remedies to secure Burns' release.Von Frank, pp. 133‚Äì148 Washburn refused to intercede in the matter, bringing criticism, and Burns remained in custody at the time Washburn left office.Von Frank, p. 239 Burns was eventually returned to slavery, after which abolitionists purchased his freedom.Von Frank, pp. 288‚Äì291 The 1854 campaign saw the rise of the secretive Know Nothing movement in Massachusetts politics. Washburn stood for reelection, but the Whig party apparatus was generally unaware of Know Nothing strength and dismissive of its candidates. One commentator described the Know Nothing slate as \\"spavined ministers, lying tooth-pullers, and buggering priests\\", and Washburn's opponent, former Whig Henry J. Gardner, as a \\"rickety vermin\\" who stood no chance of winning.Mulkern, p. 75 The outcome of the November election was a landslide: Washburn received only 21% of the vote,Gienapp, p. 136 and Know Nothing candidates won every major state and Congressional office, as well as most of the seats in the state legislature.Mulkern, p. 76 Law professor The following year he was offered a position as a lecturer at Harvard Law School, which became a full professorship in 1856. The seat had previously been occupied by Judge Edward G. Loring, who Harvard's Overseers refused to retain after he ruled that Burns be returned to slavery. For the next twenty years, Washburn served as one of three dominant figures (along with Theophilus Parsons and Joel Parker) in shaping the law school's practices and curriculum. Legal historian Charles Warren wrote of the three, \\"Parker was the great lawyer; Parsons the great teacher; and Washburn, the great man.\\"Spector, p. 125 The three men established a collegial and open learning environment at the law school. Washburn produced a significant number of legal treatises and books during his Harvard tenure; his Treatise on the American Law of Real Property formed the basis for Harvard's courses and later textbooks on the subject for the next century. His interests in history and the law were comingled in these years, with a number of his publications covering aspects of both subjects.Spector, pp. 126‚Äì128 An 1895 depiction of the 1854 protests surrounding the arrest and trial of Anthony Burns In 1860 Washburn joined in public calls for the repeal of the state's personal liberty laws. These laws, which were designed to make enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 as difficult as possible, were characterized by their opponents as an affront to the interests of slave owners, and as a source of heightened tension between north and south. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Washburn led calls for harmony in the law school, which had students from both northern and southern states.Warren, pp. 262‚Äì265 He also served, despite his relatively advanced age, in a home guard militia unit, and supported the war effort by writing, giving speeches, and donating money.Warren, p. 274 Washburn was a popular and dedicated teacher. Students would sometimes attend his lectures just to hear him speak, and he was always willing to help students with matters both academic and personal.Warren, pp. 313‚Äì314 He also regularly assisted recent graduates as they made their way into the profession.Warren, p. 315 In 1870 the Law School hired Christopher Langdell to be its first dean. Langdell began to institute significant changes in the school, which Washburn for the most part went along with.Warren, pp. 362‚Äì401 He finally resigned his professorship in 1876, and opened a law practice in Cambridge. He was encouraged to run for United States Congress, but refused. He was instead convinced to stand once again for the Massachusetts House, to which he was elected. He died in office on March 18, 1877 in Cambridge, and was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery.Spector, p. 134 Historian Washburn had a long and abiding interest in local and state history. In 1826 he published a short history of Leicester in a Worcester magazine. This work formed the basis for his Historical Sketches of the Town of Leicester, Massachusetts, published in 1860. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1827, beginning a lifelong association with that organization. He served as the society's secretary for foreign correspondence from 1866‚Äì1867, and then secretary of domestic correspondence from 1867‚Äì1877.Dunbar, B. (1987).

A large portion of his personal and business papers also resides within its collections.Emory Washburn Papers He later became a contributing member to the New England Historical and Genealogical Society and was a member of the Massachusetts Historical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Reno, p. 701 In 1840 he published Sketches of the Judicial History of Massachusetts, which provides a basic history of the colonial Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature (antecedent to the current Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court) and its justices. Biographer Robert Spector describes it as \\"the starting point and basis\\" for legal historical work relating to the court.Spector, p. 121 Washburn considered himself to be more of an antiquarian than a historian: he believed it important to conserve artifacts and historical information, leaving the interpretation of those to others. He wrote of the importance, for example, of the need for the state to preserve its own historical documents (something not given much attention in its early years).Spector, p. 128 Publications   Notes References    * External links * Category:Governors of Massachusetts Category:People from Leicester, Massachusetts Category:Leicester Academy alumni Category:Williams College alumni Category:Harvard Law School faculty Category:Historians of the United States Category:1800 births Category:1877 deaths Category:Massachusetts Whigs Category:Whig Party state governors of the United States Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Members of the American Antiquarian Society Category:Members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Category:Massachusetts state senators Category:Harvard Law School alumni ","title":"Emory Washburn"},{"id":"2611011","text":"Paintal is an Indian surname. \\"Paintal\\" (Gotra) is a sub-surname of Ahluwalias amongst Sikhs.

A PS2 dating sim game of the same name based on the anime was also made by Konami. The North American DVD was released by ADV Films in 2007. Plot The story follows Rino Rando, who has been on her own since the death of her mother, Chieri, as she transfers to Miyagami Private Academy with the recommendation of her mysterious pen pal, Mr. Poppit. Shortly after her arrival, Rino surprisingly becomes a member of elite group of girls called the Best Student Council. Rino learns that Kanade Jinguji founded Miyagami Private Academy as a place where students can live free from restrictions and that the Best Student Council was formed to ensure that freedom. Best Student Council Members receive free tuition, room and board. The story takes place at Miyagami Private Academy, a mysterious all-girl high school, its student council, the Miyagami Academy Maximum Authority Wielding Best Student Council, also known as the Best Student Council (Gokujou Seitokai), having their own Assault, Covert, and vehicle divisions. This council has more authority power than any of the faculty and staff members. The Best Student Council is divided into the four main divisions: Executive, Assault and Covert plus the Vehicle Squad. Each member of the council has their own special ability, such as special fighting techniques, the gathering of information, or weaponry such as cards, a yo-yo, or, in Rino's case, her hand puppet, Pucchan. It is revealed in an early episode that no one really knows how many members are actually in the best Student Council except the President. Characters =Executive members= ; : :Rino is the main character of the series and, on her first day, is given the title of Secretary of Best Student Council. Among the Best Student Council, she is the one that does not have any good ability or specialty. Besides, not intelligent at all, she is very dense and slow, but she is an adorable, cheerful, friendly, and kind little girl. Kanade brings her into Best Student Council to keep Rino close with her so she can protect her. She is almost always seen with Pucchan, her hand puppet companion. Pucchan's fight ability and his power of \\"Burning\\" which he use to fight is the reason the other member accept her to be in Best Student Council in the beginning of the series. She is also a member of Jinguuji family and has inherited the powers of the Jinguuji family but does not know about it. Her \\"power\\" is capable of sending her voice outwards to everyone in a large radius around her, when her \\"powers\\" awaken late in the series. Her mother Chieri was a member of the Jinguuji family and a former candidate of Jinguuji successor. She had the strongest \\"power\\" ever among the Jinguuji which was inherited by Rino. She ran away because she disliked the ways of the family but she kept this fact from Rino. Due to the fact she has powers as per family traditions, her true last name is probably Jinguuji but is never told this to protect her. :Near the end of the series, it is revealed that Pucchan's real identity is actually Tetsuya Rando (Rand≈ç Tetsuya). He is Rino's real older brother who died when he was a little kid. His spirit resides in that puppet ever since Rino's mother was still alive and probably can move because of the power she put in the doll. However, Rino is also not aware of this fact. He can only talk when somebody's hand is put inside his puppet body, that includes anybody even Rino. ; : :Kanade is the executive director and founder of Miyagami Private Academy, president of the Best Student Council, and the future successor of the Jinguuji conglomerate. She takes a special interest in Rino and takes care of her, later found to be at the request of Rino's mother, a relative of hers. She is able to telepathically communicate with other people. Also of note is that Kanade is later revealed to be Mr. Poppit, Rino's penpal at the beginning of the series. When Kanade was just a kid, she had a wish to go to school and so Miyagami Private Academy was built. Eventually, she found her place where she belongs to and gains close friends in this school among the Best Student Council members. All students like her and admire her, especially all Best student Council members who care a lot about her and are very loyal and dedicated to her. :After her graduation from high school, Kanade returns in the last episode as the director of the school. ; : :Nanaho is one of the two vice presidents of the Best Student Council and also the leader of the Assault Squad, using a yo-yo as her weapon. She is very afraid of lightning as she flinches horribly when it strikes and cries out, causing people to look at her strangely. She secretly has a great love for \\"girly\\" things like stuffed animals, which can be seen from the decor of her room. This provides a stark contrast to her tomboyish outer appearance and behavior. She was first skeptical by the idea that Pucchan was magical, but later learns that he can talk on her own hand. Nanaho is also an old friend of Kanade and protects and advises Kanade in various matters by her own free will, and not because of the obligations that have been bestowed to the Kinjo family to protect Jinguuji family from generations ago. She has 6 brothers and she is the youngest child of her family. Since childhood she was trained to protect Kanade, which caused her to bear a grudge towards the other girl until Kanade freed her from her forced duties as a guardian. After she was free, she was concerned of Kanade who at that time did not have a will to live which was just like her before she was freed. Then, Nanaho vowed to be by Kanade's side to make Kanade free as a gratitude of giving her freedom and she became Kanade's very closest, long time best friend, and most faithful friend ever since. ; : :Kuon is the second vice president of the best student council and is the top ranking member of the Covert Squad. During the Kuon-centered episodes (15 and 16), it is revealed that she is actually a spy for another organization, on a mission to discover the hidden powers of the Jinguuji family. However, this duty was forced on her as the company her father ran was supported by the organization. She is torn between her family's business and the Best Student Council, not wanting to leave her family or the Best Student Council. During the end of episode fifteen, Kanade refuses to give up her secret to Kuon forcing her (to Kuon's pleasure) to stay at Miyagami Academy. She is a specialist in gathering information, surprising Nanaho during her transfer interview to Miyagami Private Academy. Kuon is also well-trained in self-defense, as can be seen when she performs throws on grown men much larger than herself during the series. Kuon is also one quarter non-Japanese (unspecified from Konami's website) coming from her paternal grandfather's side, and she also comes from a wealthy family. ; : :Mayura is the overstressed accountant for the Best Student Council. She is usually always busy trying to fit in all the needs of the council into the budget, and has appeared in almost every episode working with an abacus. She is always pleading with the rest of the Executive members not to ignore her about the needs of the budget, but is not successful in getting them to listen until one episode centered on her. In short the rest of the Best Student Council (excluding President Kanade) had forced a break up between Mayura and a boyfriend. This was justified since the man was known to date many girls at the same time. They then realized she did it for her friend to see if he was a nice guy. But in order to keep Mayura happy, they all began doing nice things for her, the best thing being that making sure the budget was secure for the next month. =Assault Squad= The is in charge of the safety and well being of the school by eliminating any potential threats. The assault squad gain their knowledge of threats from the covert squad. ; : :Sayuri fights with her wooden sword using the Hida Kasseiryuu and is also the number one member of the assault squad. She is an old friend of Rein. Before she was invited to Miyagami Private Academy, she was referred to as a genius swordsman who inherited the pure blood of Hida. An incident that caused her to leave a senior swordsman permanently injured caused her to feel deep guilt ever since, and she sends him flowers daily. When Sayuri's glasses are taken off, she has a hard time seeing, and ends up muttering \\"my glasses, my glasses\\" without ever being able to locate them. Sayuri is noted as having a particularly ample bust, something that her best friend Rein is often envious of. ; : :Rein uses playing cards as her weapon of choice and is a childhood friend of Sayuri. The Hida family took her in after her father disappeared (most likely due to his gambling debts). She enjoys playing card games and does not mind gambling. Rein also has a love of words, and many times she is heard speaking a sentence using one word and splitting it three ways though they all mean the same thing, such as when she called Sayuri \\"an idiot, a moron, and a complete dingdong\\". Rein has an extremely maternal side that is shown when a baby is abandoned at their dorms. This is said to be because her father abandoned her when she was very young, making her understand well how it feels to not be loved by anyone. Sometimes Pucchan refers her as little kid senpai due to her childish acts and nature. Rein also cheats quite a lot because she hates losing making her yearn for her father. Though she has expressed a dislike for her father, claiming she would beat him up if he ever showed up, but deep down she actually still loves him deep in her heart. ; : :Kaori fights bare-handed and is a classmate of Rino and Ayumu. She has two brothers and one sister, which is why she does not live in the Gokujou-ryou like the other members of the student council. She has been seen out on the streets early in the morning walking to the school, while the rest of them are already in the dining room eating breakfast, indicating that she doesn't live in the dorm rooms with the rest of the Best Student Council. This is only clearly made known to the rest when a series of events cause them to stumble upon her house and see Kaori's siblings. In episode three, she admits she has a secret crush on Kanade Jinguuji and is jealous of Rino. =Covert Squad= The specializes in gathering intelligence and performs espionage and surveillance operations. For example, when a new student plans to transfer to Miyagami Private Academy a background check is conducted by the Covert Squad. In the opening title sequence Kuon Ginga and Seina Katsura are originally accompanied by two shadows representing secret members of the Covert Squad. Later these shadows are revealed to be Kotoha Kutsugi to the right (starting in episode 16), and Ayumu Oume to the left (starting in episode 21). ; : :Seina is the captain of the Covert Squad and Minamo's elder sister. Constantly seen smiling, she can also be very serious when necessary. Seina is first known simply as an old friend of Kanade, but is revealed later in the series to be a relative of hers. While Seina is of Jinguuji blood, she did not inherit the Jinguuji powers, and as a result, had to have her last name changed. Near the end of the series, she is revealed to be the new chairman of V, a group that oversees the workings of the Jinguuji family and controls even the family's leader (which was the main reason that Kanade had trouble rebelling against the family). This position was taken by Seina in an effort to help Kanade. Kuon states at the end of the series that Seina might be the real mysterious one among Best Student Council members. There is no measurement what she is capable of doing and has infinite ways to reach her goals. ; : :Kotoha is the best member of the Covert Squad and uses shurikens as her weapon of choice. She views Kuon with great suspicion and as a threat when her true identity is revealed. Later she comes to accept her as the leader of the covert squad once seeing all the hard choices Kuon has had to make throughout her life. She is said to never smile, but towards the end of episode sixteen she finally smiles at Kuon. Kotoha is also a master of unarmed combat and disguise, posing as the caretaker of Gotojoju-ryou in episode 11 during a futsal match between the Best Student Council and the Kenran student council. The game was later won almost single-handedly by her, despite the other team possessing a huge lead in the first half of the match. ; : :Ayumu is Rino's best friend, classmate and the one to introduce her to the Best Student Council. She is later found to be from the Oume clan of ninja, who left them because she disliked the rules and policies that prohibited her from acting or dressing how most girls would. She has a twin brother named Urato. In the episode centered around her, Ayumu is discovered by a talent scout and planned to enter showbiz as AYU-AYU, but bails after figuring out she would have to wear a ninja outfit. In this same episode, it is also revealed that she is a member of the Covert squad as well. ; : :Minamo is Seina's little sister and also inherited no powers from the Jinguji blood within her. She has a very rare heart condition making her very physically weak, though this is hidden by her constantly playing pranks and general acts of mischief (this has included making a mess of the school dorms and throwing Nanaho's European-imported teddy bear into pouring rain). She likes writing scripts and drawings. She was the one behind projects such as the Best Student Council card game featuring the members of the student council and the (poorly received) play \\"The Alien Space Creature from Outer Space.\\" Even though Minamo has a weak heart, she doesn't want others to pity her, causing her to constantly push herself despite her uncurable condition. ; : :Maachi Hisakawa is the Best Student Council accommodation 'Landlord' and overseer. Being only in the fifth grade, she does not attend Miyagami Private Academy classes. She is only of 11 years of age. Her duties at the Miyagami Private Academy are to cook, clean, and do such things a landlord would do. Maachi Hisakawa is proud of what she does, as its fun and enjoyable to do what she does. In the show, she is almost always seen with a smile on her face and says little more than her trademark giggle, \\"tee-heh.\\" Being that way, she is liked and cared for by the rest of the council. In episode 23, \\"Extraordinary Girl Detective Team\\", Rino and Pucchan lead a team of girl detectives in search of why Maachi is seen skipping school on somedays. After a long day, they find out why. In episode 11, \\"Winning Five\\", the entire futsal club at Miyagami Academy gets sick and the Best Student Council, provoked by rival Kenran Student Council, participate in their place. The Kenran Student Council's dirty tactics get the best of the Best Student Council until Maachi volunteers herself to play. After single handedly turning the match around to win, it is revealed that it was actually Kotoha Kutsugi disguised as Maachi. =Vehicle Squad= ; : :Cyndi is the only shown member of the Vehicle Squad and speaks in a combination of English and Japanese, though her lines have usually been short, such as \\"me too\\" and \\"roger\\". She addresses Kanade as \\"Boss\\". She is in love with Pucchan, and later confesses this to him (Pucchan never turned her down). Everyone else, however, does point out that \\"He's a puppet!\\" Cyndi is later found to be, in fact, quite adept and aware of the situation around her. In episode 25, Cyndi can speak Japanese (English in the dubbed version) fluently but it is later revealed that she never spoke it properly because her mother (who speaks in a highly rude manner much like gangsters picking a fight) told her she was not speaking it right.

A split-rail fence or log fence (also known as a zigzag fence, worm fence or snake fence historically due to its meandering layout) is a type of fence constructed in the United States and Canada, and is made out of timber logs, usually split lengthwise into rails and typically used for agricultural or decorative fencing. Such fences require much more timber than other types of fences, and so are generally only common in areas where wood is abundant. However, they are very simple in their construction, and can be assembled with few tools even on hard or rocky ground. They also can be built without using any nails or other hardware; such hardware was often scarce in frontier areas. They aren't particularly popular in very rocky areas where post hole digging is almost impossible. They can even be partially or wholly disassembled if the fence needs to be moved or the wood becomes more useful for other purposes. During the American Civil War, these split rail fences were a major source of firewood for both the Union and Confederate armies. Log fence with double posts (photo taken in 1938). Split rail fences were made of easy to split, rot-resistant wood. Traditionally American chestnut was the timber of choice until chestnut blight eliminated this tree. Currently, most split rails are made from cedar. Whether of chestnut or cedar, these logs were cut to a length of and split down the length of the log. Each half was then split into quarters, then eighths and so on until the rails were of a usable size. A log may produce from four rails from an log to over a dozen from larger logs. The rails are stacked on top of one another. Most split rail fences have the rails stacked in an interlocking zig-zag fashion that is self-supporting, easy to create, easy to repair, and easy to disassemble. A split-rail fence with supports. Some timber fences have the rails stacked directly on top of each other and secured with double fence posts (one on either side of the rails). This made a more permanent and compact fence but remained easy to repair. The distance between either the zigs or the zags is generally or one rod. The area of a field can therefore be calculated by counting zigs or zags along the side and end of the field: one hundred sixty square rods is . A mortised split-rail fence in suburban America (built 1999). Patent cedar fence In Canada an attempt was made to patent several cedar fence designs. These styles became known as Patent Cedar Fences. The use of two rails to form a cross, having a top rail, bench rails and lower heavier rails, allowed it to be free standing, withstand heavy winds and take up less fence bottom than the zigzag or snake fence. Mortised fence In the United Kingdom (and increasingly in suburban America) a different style of split-rail fence is used. This is not free-standing but consists of vertical posts placed in the ground, having holes (mortises) in each side into which the roughly pointed ends of split rails (usually of sweet chestnut) are placed. No zig-zagging is necessary. This style is commonly used as decorative fencing, or for horse-keeping.

He is known as a leading authority on medicine and Jewish law and referred to as the Tzitz Eliezer after his 21-volume halachic treatise covering a wide breadth of halacha, including Jewish medical ethics, and daily ritual issues from Shabbat to kashrut. Biography Rav Eliezer Waldenberg was born in Jerusalem in 1915 to Rabbi Yaakov Gedalya who immigrated from Kovno, Lithuania to pre-Mandatory Palestine in the early 1900s. He studied in the Etz Chaim Yeshiva and was a student of the Rosh Yeshiva, Rav Isser Zalman Meltzer. Rav Waldenberg wrote his first book, Dvar Eliezer, at age 19 in 1934. For many years, Rav Waldenberg served as a community rabbi at a small synagogue on Jaffa Road adjacent to the Shaare Tzedek Hospital. Many doctors prayed at the synagogue and brought their questions to the rabbi. Rav Waldenberg began to answer their questions about Jewish law and its application to medical ethics, and would come to teach a weekly medical ethics class to the hospital's doctors and nurses. He was close to Rabbi Ben Zion Meir Hai Uziel, and was the head of the Shaarei Zion Yeshiva, founded by him. In 1957, Rav Waldenberg became president of the District Rabbinical Court in Jerusalem,. He was later appointed to the Beit Din Hagadol in Jerusalem where he sat with Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv. In 1976, Rabbi Waldenberg was awarded the Israel Prize for Rabbinical studies. Rabbi Waldenberg died on 21 November 2006 at Shaarei Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem and was buried later the same day at Jerusalem's Har HaMenuchot cemetery. Medical opinions His major work Tzitz Eliezer is an encyclopedic treatise on halachic questions, viewed as one of the great achievements of halachic scholarship of the 20th century. Though he wrote numerous books and articles in all fields of halacha, he was best known for his decisions on medical dilemmas. He addresses in his volumes complex medical questions including fertility, abortion, organ transplantation, euthanasia, sex reassignment surgery, autopsies, smoking, cosmetic surgery, and medical experimentation. His halachic opinions are valued by rabbis across the religious spectrum. Rabbi Waldenberg forbade performing elective surgery on someone who is neither sick nor in pain, such as cosmetic surgery. He argues that such activities are outside the boundaries of the physician's mandate to heal. Notably, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein disagreed with this opinion. He allowed first trimester abortion of a fetus which would be born with a deformity that would cause it to suffer, and termination of a fetus with a lethal fetal defect such as Tay‚ÄìSachs disease up to the end of the second trimester of gestation.Tzitz Eliezer, 9:51:3. He ruled that a child conceived outside the womb, through in vitro fertilization, has no parents and bears no halachic relationship either to the biological parents or the \\"surrogate mother,\\" the woman who carries the child to term.Id., 15:45 He was one of a small but growing number of rabbis to forbid smoking. Many of his medical opinions were recorded by his student Avraham Steinberg, M.D, and then translated into summary volumes. In the chapter entitled \\"On the treatment which exposes the physician to danger,\\" Rabbi Waldenberg wrote: Waldenberg ruled sex reassignment surgery to be permissible in the case of a baby born androgynous where one set of organs were more developed.Ref. Tzitz Eliezer 11:78 After careful halachic and medical consideration, Waldenberg ruled that a transsexual women following sex reassignment surgery is a halachic woman. He wrote, \\"The external anatomy which is visible is what determines the halakha\\" in the present tense.Id., 25:26:6 Kevod HaBriyot Waldenberg permitted hearing Torah reading, Shofar blowing and Megillah reading by means of a loudspeaker, telephone, or radio, if no other options were available. (Responsa Tzitz Eliezer, 8:11.). However Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach strongly disagreed on this. (see Minchas Shlomo I:9). Waldenberg held that voices replicated by electronic devices generally have the status of noise from musical instruments, rather than that of actual voices.(Responsa Tzitz Eliezer, 15:33.) He also emphasized the Jewish concept of Kevod HaBriyot (human honor or dignity) in his rulings. As an example, Rabbi Waldenberg adduced this concept in support of his ruling that a deaf person can use an electric hearing aid on Shabbat. Rabbi Waldenberg wrote: Jewish Law, the State, and the Military Rabbi Waldenberg also wrote a multivolume set on the practical issues of government called Hilkhot Medinah. In this work he takes issue with many positions of former chief rabbis Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, Shlomo Goren, and Isser Yehuda Unterman. He writes in support of yeshiva students' exemption from military service because through the merit of their Torah learning they help protect the country. He granted workers the right to strike when employers have violated a workplace condition that has become ‚Äúthe custom of the land.‚Äù Most legal authorities required workers to bring their employer to a beit din (religious court) before resorting to a strike. \\"In situations such as these, in which the worker is absolutely certain that the employer has transgressed and violated a condition that has been established as the custom of the land, the worker may take the law into his own hands by levying the fine that the appointed communal leaders have deemed appropriate for a situation such as this.\\"Tzitz Eliezer 2:23 Even though, \\"A convert may not hold a position of Jewish communal authority.\\".Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilkhos Melakhim 1:4 Rabbi Waldenberg ruled that a convert may not serve in a lone communal position but he may serve on a communal committee.Tzitz Eliezer 19:48 Works * * ◊î◊ú◊õ◊ï◊™ ◊û◊ì◊ô◊†◊î [Hilchos Medinah] (in Hebrew) on legal issues of the political state in three-volumes *Divrei Eliezer, novella *Shvisas Hayam on ships, maritime law, and Shabbos References  Further reading  *Fred Rosner, Pioneers in Jewish Medical Ethics, Jason Aronson Publishers, 1997. *Jewish Medical Law: A Concise Response.

The wars were fierce around the Pearl River Delta, especially in Toi Shan of the Sze Yup counties. The wars resulted in roughly a million dead with many more fleeing for their lives. Background Hakka literally means guest family, and Punti literally means natives. The Punti are also referred to by the languages they spoke, Yue Chinese. The origins of this bloody conflict lay in the resentment of the Cantonese towards the Hakka people whose dramatic population growth threatened the Cantonese people. The Hakka were marginalized and resentful in turn, and were forced to inhabit the hills and waterways rather than the fertile plains. The existing Cantonese-speaking natives (, bendi) of these areas, known in Cantonese as \\"Punti\\", were protective of their own more fertile lands, and the newcomers were pushed to the outer fringes of fertile plains, despite having migrated legitimately, or they settled in more mountainous regions to eke out a living. Conflict between the two groups grew and it is thought that \\"Hakka\\" became a term of derision used by the Punti aimed at the newcomers. Eventually, the tension between the two groups (the Hakkas had by then been settled for several hundred years and could not be regarded as migrants in any sense) would lead to a series of 19th-century skirmishes in the Pearl River Delta known as the Punti‚ÄìHakka Clan Wars. The problem was not that the two groups spoke a different tongue. In fact, the \\"locals\\" comprised different peoples speaking several mutually unintelligible tongues, as was typical of the Chinese countryside all over southern China, but they would regard each other as \\"locals\\" or Puntis, but exclude the Hakkas from such designation. (The Chinese bendi describes any native people in any location; the English term \\"Punti\\" describes the native Cantonese in Guangdong but not the emigrant Cantonese elsewhere.) Over time the newcomers adopted the term \\"Hakka\\" to refer to themselves, not least due to the migratory tendencies inherent in their own culture. Although most of the immigrants called Hakkas were Hakka speakers, the term was later used to include various hill ethnicities such as the She and Yao people who were registered as so called \\"Guest Families\\" as they migrated with the Hakkas together from the hills. Intermarriages among Hakka and Punti members was extremely rare. Through studies of both Cantonese and Hakka genealogies, some Hakka and Punti people with the same surnames allege that they may have the same ancestors, although their descendants strongly identify with one group to the exclusion of the other. During the Qing conquest of the Ming, Ming loyalists under Koxinga invaded Taiwan and established an independent kingdom in the hopes of eventually retaking mainland China. In an attempt to defeat these warriors and pirates without a war, the Kangxi Emperor strengthened his dynasty's sea ban (haijin) in 1661 and issued the order for the Great Clearance of the southeastern coast. Chinese, especially the ethnic Tanka, living off the coast of Shandong to Guangdong were ordered to destroy their property and move inland 30 to (about ) upon pain of death in order to deprive the Taiwanese rebels of support or targets to raid. The governors and viceroys of the affected provinces submitted scathing memorials and the policy was reversed after eight years. In 1669 and 1671, however, strong typhoons destroyed what few settlements existed. As far fewer Punti returned to the abandoned lands than expected, the Qing ruler decided to provided incentives to repopulate these areas. The most visible of those who responded were the Hakka. For some time the Punti and Hakka lived together peacefully. As the population of Guangdong Province soared, life became increasingly difficult and unrest broke out, such as the Red Turban Rebellion led by the Cantonese attacking Ho Yun and Fat Shan. Clan war During the Red turban rebellion in Canton, the Hakkas had helped the imperial army to raid Punti villages to kill the rebels and any real or suspected sympathisers, including villagers who were forced to pay taxes to the Red Turbans. This precipitated open hostility between the Hakka and Punti, with the Punti attacking Hakka villages in revenge. Battles raged. Both sides fortified their villages with walls, destroyed bridges and roads, and raised armies as best they could. Entire villages were involved in the fighting with all able-bodied men called to fight. The Cantonese were armed with the help of their relatives in Hong Kong and the Chinese diaspora who lived abroad. Some captives were sold to Cuba and South America as coolies through Hong Kong and Macau, and others sold to the brothels of Macau. Resolution Conflict reached a devastating scale. Over a million died and thousands of villages were destroyed. Because the Punti significantly outnumbered the Hakka, the Hakka losses were more extensive, the population share of Hakka in the Sze Yup area dropped to 3%, with many relocated to Guangxi. For many years the Hakka were allocated their own independent county, Chek Kai (), which was carved out of south-eastern Toishan. Similar Cantonese‚ÄìHakka clan wars overseas Conflict between Cantonese and Hakka people also occurred in the state of Perak, Malaya (present-day Malaysia) during the mid-19th century when southern Chinese immigrants arrived to work as coolies and mine laborers. Due to linguistic differences and a history of mutual hatred for each other back in China, bloody wars broke out. This series of conflicts, marked by violence between the Cantonese-dominated (and later on, Fujianese) Ghee Hin Kongsi and the primarily Hakka Hai San Secret Society, is known as the Larut War, which concluded with the signing of the Pangkor Treaty of 1874. Although Ghee Hin Kongsi was Cantonese-dominated, it had Hakkas on its side and the leader was a Dabu Hakka, Chin Ah Yam.

It rises above the valley floor, finishing with a sheer-sided basalt cap. It was formed during the Miocene epoch. At that time basaltic flood lavas covered much of eastern Oregon. In subsequent faulting, great blocks were tilted and Abert Rim is at the western end of one of these blocks, while Lake Abert lies on top of another. Stretching more than from Lakeview north to Alkali Lake, Abert Rim is also the longest exposed fault scarp in North America. Bighorn sheep were transplanted to the rim in 1975 and 1977 from nearby Hart Mountain, and are often spotted from the Abert Rim geologic point of interest sign located along Highway 395. Raptors, such as the Ferruginous Hawk, are also common in the area. The Chewaucan River enters Lake Abert from the south, however it has no outlet. The lake level varies depending on rainfall and it nearly completely dried up 140 years ago. It is one of the Great Basin lakes. The escarpment and lake were first mapped on December 20, 1843, by John C. Fr√©mont, who named it after Colonel John James Abert, his commanding officer. The southern section of Abert Rim is a popular spot for paragliding and hang gliding because of the frequent thermals created by warm valley air rising up against the cliffs. The area was formerly considered by many to be the hang gliding capital of the West until paragliding superseded it in popularity. National free flight festivals are held each year in late June and during the Fourth of July.

Music in this genre is extremely varied as a result. Kay≈çkyoku in the narrower and more practical sense, however, excludes J-pop and enka. Unlike \\"J-pop\\" singers such as Southern All Stars' Keisuke Kuwata, the singers of the kay≈çkyoku genre do not use stylized pronunciations based on the English language, but prefer traditional Japanese. There are exceptions, such as in singer Momoe Yamaguchi's song \\"Rock 'n' Roll Widow\\". Unlike enka, kay≈çkyoku is also not based on emotional displays of effort while singing. Famous kay≈çkyoku artists include Kyu Sakamoto, The Peanuts, The Tigers, Candies, Pink Lady, Seiko Matsuda, Junko Sakurada, The Checkers and Onyanko Club.  Characteristics  Kayokyoku music has simple melodies that are easy to follow and play along to. The lyrics of Kayokyoku are simple and attempt to relate to an everyday Japanese individual. Kayokyoku singers also relate to common Japanese listeners by appearing as cute and approachable, with many aspects about their appearance and actions dictated by production companies. The base of Kayokyoku songs aims towards a sentimental feeling. The music draws on being able to relate to listeners and tries to voice the feelings that he/she keeps bottled in due to social appearances. Kayokyoku's style has become prominent due to the karaoke boom that occurred in the middle of the 1970s. A large focus of Karaoke revolves around mimicking not only the song being sung, but also the image of the singer and the image brought out by the lyrics. The simple rhythm and lyrics of Kayokyoku made these songs very popular to sing at Karaoke. An NHK survey revealed that around 80% of males over thirty years of age sang Kayokyoku songs through karaoke machines. History =1920s‚Äì1940s: Origin= The term kay≈çkyoku originally referred to Western classical \\"lied\\" in Japan. However, NHK radio began to use the term as another name of ry≈´k≈çka around 1927, and this took hold in the late 10s of the Showa Era. (1935 ‚Äì 1944). However, many songs popular during this era became lost due to the association with painful memories involving World War II. =1950s‚Äì1960s: Mood kay≈ç era= Kayokyoku, though associated with ry≈´k≈çka, also refers to a specific musical genre unique from ry≈´k≈çka. For example, said that the popular genre of Showa 20s (1945 ‚Äì 1954) was ry≈´k≈çka and the popular genre of Showa 30s (1955 ‚Äì 1964) was kay≈çkyoku. In Showa 30s, Frank Nagai, inspired by jazz, sang new songs called . During the Japanese post-war economic miracle, Mood Kay≈ç music became one of the most popular genres in Japan. \\"Mood Kay≈ç\\" was influenced by Latin and jazz music. On the other hand, in Showa 30s, modern enka began to be formed and rock and roll began to have an influence on Japanese popular singers such as Kyu Sakamoto. In 1949, 12-year-old Hibari Misora made her recording debut with song \\"Kappa Boogie Woogie\\". In the 1950s, Misora, Chiemi Eri and Izumi Yukimura were called \\"Sannin Musume\\" (lit. \\"Three Girls\\"). Hachiro Kasuga, Michiya Mihashi and Hideo Murata were called \\"Three crows\\". In the early 1960s, Kyu Sakamoto and The Peanuts became famous. Shinichi Mori debuted in 1966. Linda Yamamoto also debuted in 1966. In the late 1960, Group Sounds became famous. Teruhiko Saigo, Yukio Hashi and Kazuo Funaki were called \\"Gosanke\\" in the 1960s. Keiko Fuji debuted in 1969 and the music genre like her songs was called enka, which was like Japanese traditional music. In 1969, Japanese child singer Osamu Minagawa made the Japanese Oricon weekly number-one single \\"Kuroneko no Tango\\" at the age of only six, establishing the still-standing youngest record to top the Oricon single charts. During the 1950s and 60s, many Kay≈çkyoku groups and singers gained experience performing on US military bases in Japan. Around the same time, Yakuza manager Kazuo Taoka reorganized the concert touring industry by treating the performers as professionals.Martin, Ian, \\"'Golden age' of kayoukyoku holds lessons for modern J-pop \\", Japan Times, 26 May 2011, p. 13. Kay≈çkyoku from this period is sometimes also believed to have had its roots with Chinese immigrant jazz musicians who had fled Shanghai during the communist takeover, and were collaborating with the American soldiers who were occupying Japan at that time. In 1949, when the communists took over Mainland China and established the People's Republic of China, one of the first actions taken by the government was to denounce popular music as decadent and replace it with Chinese revolutionary music. Although a number of Shanghainese musicians fled to the British colony of Hong Kong, a few musicians instead settled in Japan, where they became members of the Far East Network and collaborated with the American soldiers to introduce a variety of new genres to the Japanese public. Some of the most famous kay≈çkyoku musicians of this era include songwriter Rokusuke Ei and singer Kyu Sakamoto. Their 1961 song \\"Sukiyaki\\" in particular became a global hit and topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. =1970s‚Äì1980s: Idol kay≈ç era= In the 1970s, Hiromi Go (who belonged to Johnny & Associates at that time), Hideki Saijo and Goro Noguchi were called \\"New Gosanke\\". Saori Minami, Mari Amachi and Rumiko Koyanagi were called \\"Shin Sannin Musume\\" (lit. \\"New Three Girls\\"). Akiko Wada, who came from \\"Jazz Cafe\\", also became popular. Momoe Yamaguchi, Junko Sakurada and Masako Mori were called \\"Hana no Ch≈´san Torio\\" (lit. \\"Flower Junior High School Three Grade Trio\\"). Y≈´ Aku became one of the most famous lyricists of kay≈çkyoku. He wrote Finger 5's 1973 song \\"Kojin Jugy≈ç\\" and female duo Pink Lady's 1976 debut song \\"Pepper Keibu.\\" In the 1980s, many female idols such as Seiko Matsuda, Okada Yukiko and Akina Nakamori became popular. Johnny's male solo singer Masahiko Kond≈ç also became popular and his song \\"Orokamono\\" won the 29th Japan Record Awards Grand Prix Award in 1987. The music genre kay≈çkyoku is regarded as a base of another genre \\"J-pop\\". In the 1980s, a part of Japanese idol was independent from kay≈çkyoku and associated with Japanese rock musicians. Late 80s' popular band Onyanko Club was a band of borderline era between \\"kay≈çkyoku\\" and \\"J-pop\\". Although Japanese kay≈çkyoku-style music after Hikaru Genji and Dreams Come True was called \\"J-pop\\", several people claimed that \\"J-pop\\" was a subgenre of kay≈çkyoku music. In the 1980s, remained kay≈çkyoku music except Japanese idol's music became regarded as enka. After Hibari Misora died in 1989, the genre called kay≈çkyoku mostly vanished and several kay≈çkyoku singers became regarded as enka singers, even if their sound did not change. However, Shinichi Mori and Kiyoshi Maekawa considered themselves to be not enka singers but kay≈çkyoku singers. Maekawa claimed that an example of true enka singers was Sabur≈ç Kitajima, who could use a lot of kobushi (a kind of vocalism) for singing. As the result, the music of the genre caused some confusion. For example, Kiyoshi Maekawa's song \\"Himawari\\", produced by pop singer Masaharu Fukuyama, was regarded as enka for no special reason. When Junko Akimoto became popular in 2008, however, she was said to be a modern example of kay≈çkyoku singers.

The origin of its name is not clear, but the most accepted theory is that it comes from the Latin trivium (meaning \\"three streets\\"), because there were three streets all leading to the current Piazza dei Crociferi, a square next to the modern Trevi square. Its coat of arms is made of three swords on a red background.  History  This rione, during the Roman republic belonged to the third region, while during the Roman empire was split up into two regions: the VI, called Alta Semita and the VII, called via Lata. During the ancient Roman period, in rione Trevi there were large groups of private houses with some monumental buildings. Since that time the area was actually split up into two parts: a lower one, level and next to the river Tiber, and a higher one on the hills. The first one was one of the center of the activities of the city, while the second one was a rich and peaceful residential area. After the fall of the Roman empire, a lot of people moved away from the hills to settle next to the river, in the lower part. The urbanization followed the people: next to the river Tiber the rione was full of buildings while almost nothing was built again on the hills until the Renaissance. Piazza dei Crociferi, with the Church of Santa Maria in Trivio In 1600 urbanization, new streets, churches and fountains caused the rione Trevi to be quite crowded, and it did not change significantly until the end of the 19th century. The Quirinal Hill, partially isolated from the crowded part close to the river, was slowly becoming a center of power thanks to numerous buildings belonging to the Pope. Under the domination of Napoleon, in 1811, the Quirinal Hill was selected to be the center of the imperial power in Rome. The plan was not completed because of the fall of Napoleon, but the idea remained and was partially achieved after Rome became capital of Italy, after the 1870. In fact nowadays several ministries are placed in the rione Trevi. This changed completely the appearance of the higher part of the rione, that was not very crowded but full of small streets, churches and monumental buildings. The most famous monument in the rione is Trevi Fountain.  Geography  =Boundaries= Northward, Trevi borders with Colonna (R. III), whose boundary is marked by a brief stretch of Via del Corso and by Via delle Muratte, Via di Santa Maria in Via, Largo San Claudio, Via del Pozzetto, Via del Bufalo, Largo del Nazareno, Via del Nazareno, Via del Tritone and Piazza Barberini. It also borders with Ludovisi (R. XVI), through Via di San Basilio. Eastward, the rione borders with Sallustiano (R. XVII), from which is separated by Via Leonida Bissolati, Via Giosu√® Carducci, Via di Santa Susanna and Largo di Santa Susanna, and with Castro Pretorio (R. XVIII), from which is separated by Piazza San Bernardo and Via XX Settembre. To the south, the rione borders with Monti (R. I), from which is separated by the Foro Traiano, Via IV Novembre, Largo Magnanapoli, Via XXIV Maggio and Via del Quirinale. Southward, it also shares a short boundary with Campitelli (R. X), which is marked by a portion of Piazza Venezia. To the west, Trevi borders with Pigna (R. IX), and the boundary is outlined by Piazza Venezia and Via del Corso. =Local geography= ;Squares * Piazza Barberini * Piazza della Pilotta * Piazza del Quirinale * Piazza San Bernardo * Piazza San Silvestro * Piazza Santi Apostoli * Piazza Scanderbeg * Piazza di Trevi ;Roads * Via del Corso  Places of interest  = Palaces and other buildings = * Palazzo Baracchini, in Via XX Settembre, built in 19th century by Giulio Podesti, is the seat of the Ministry of Defence * Palazzo Barberini, in Via Quattro Fontane. * Palazzo del Bufalo alle Fratte, in Largo del Nazareno. * Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi, in Piazza dei Santi Apostoli. * Palazzo Colonna, in Via della Pilotta. * Palazzo Muti Papazzurri, in Piazza della Pilotta. * Palazzo Gentili del Drago, in Via in Arcione. * Palazzo Guglielmi, in Piazza dei Santi Apostoli. * Palazzo Mancini, in Via del Corso. * Palazzo Mengarini, in Via XXIV Maggio. * Palazzo Poli, in Via Poli. * Palazzo del Quirinale, in Piazza del Quirinale. * Palazzo Valentini, in Via IV Novembre. * Palazzo Scanderbeg, in Piazza Scanderbeg. = Churches = * San Marcello al Corso * Oratory of Santissimo Crocifisso * Madonna dell'Archetto * Basilica dei Santi XII Apostoli * Santa Maria di Loreto * Santissimo Nome di Maria al Foro Traiano * Santa Maria del Carmine alle Tre Cannelle * Santa Croce e San Bonaventura dei Lucchesi * Santa Maria dell'Umilt√† * Santa Rita da Cascia alle Vergini * Santi Vincenzo e Anastasio a Trevi * Santa Maria in Trivio * Oratory of Santissimo Sacramento * Santa Maria in Via * Santi Claudio e Andrea dei Borgognoni * San Basilio agli Orti Sallustiani * San Nicola da Tolentino * Santa Susanna alle Terme di Diocleziano * San Silvestro al Quirinale * Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi * Saint Andrew's Church of Scotland * Waldensian church in Trevi =Fountains= * Trevi Fountain * Fontana del Tritone * Quattro Fontane =Education= Public libraries in Trevi include Biblioteca Romana Sarti, that was established in 1881 by the architect Antonio Sarti and Casa delle Traduzioni.\\"Biblioteche ed i Centri specializzati.\\" City of Rome.

It is approximately long and wide at its widest point. It is located northeast of the small, unincorporated community of Valley Falls, Oregon. The lake was named in honor of Colonel John James Abert by explorer John C. Fremont during his 1843 expedition into Central Oregon. No fish live in the alkaline waters of the lake; however, its dense population of brine shrimp supports a variety of shorebirds. The lake is also an important stop on the bird migration route known as the Pacific flyway.  Ancient Lake Chewaucan  The arid land around Lake Abert was once lush. During the Pleistocene epoch, vast areas of south-central Oregon were covered by lakes and wetlands. As the last ice age was ending, rain and runoff from melting snow filled the lowlands throughout this region of the Great Basin, creating an immense freshwater lake called Lake Chewaucan.

There is no archaeological evidence of human utilization of Lake Chewaucan during this time. The earliest evidence for possible human occupation of the basin comes from the Paisley Caves , which were originally excavated by Luther Cressman in the late 1930s. Cressman found some inconclusive evidence that humans could have begun occupation of the area around 11,000 years ago.Jerrems, Jerry, \\"An Archaeological View of Summer Lake Valley, Oregon\\" , Sundance Archeological Research Fund, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno Nevada, 27 April 2007.

Lake Chewaucan began to dry up at the close of the Pleistocene epoch. As it shrank, salts and alkali were concentrated in its remaining waters, and the result was the formation of Lake Abert and Summer Lake. Today, the two lakes are apart and are the only remnants of Lake Chewaucan.\\"Pluvial Lakes: Oregon‚Äôs inland seas\\" , Oregon: A Geologic History, Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, Portland, Oregon, 9 February 2010.Oregon topographic map, United States Geological Survey, United States Department of Interior, Reston, Virginia; displayed via ACME mapper, www.acme.com, 9 February 2010.  Lake environment  Lake Abert beyond Abert Rim Lake Abert is an endorheic body of water that occupies the eastern arm of pluvial Lake Chewaucan basin. The lake has an elongated triangular shape. It is approximately long and wide at the south end of the lake, growing to wide at the north end. In total, the lake covers approximately . Despite its size, the lake‚Äôs maximum depth is only . Its average depth is .\\"Abert Lake\\" , World Lakes Database, International Lake Environment Committee Foundation, Shiga, Japan, 1999. The east side of Lake Abert is bounded by Abert Rim, a steep escarpment that rises over above the lake surface. The lake is bordered on the west by a long ridge called Coglan Buttes and on the north by the Coleman Hills. The lake's only year-around source of fresh water comes from the Chewaucan River, which flows into the lake from the south. The Lake Abert drainage area covers . The environment in the Abert drainage basin is semi-arid. Most of the precipitation in the area occurs as snowfall during the winter months, and the Chewaucan River system is fed primarily by seasonal snowmelt. The lake‚Äôs only other source of fresh water are summer thundershowers that produce a small amount of runoff from Abert Rim. Because the lake has no outlet, it has developed a high concentrations of sodium carbonates, common salt, and alkali in its water. Crystallized mineral crusts on rocks along the lakeshore can be several inches thick. Some mineral deposits are evident on boulders above the present lake surface.  Ecology  Lake Abert seen from space Fish cannot survive in the lake because of the high salinity and alkali content; as a consequence, brine shrimp are abundant.Cain, Eric (producer), \\"Abert Lake\\", Oregon Field Guide video (Episode 405), Oregon Public Broadcasting, Portland, Oregon, 1993. The lake provides an excellent habitat for a variety of shore birds. It is one of Oregon‚Äôs few inland nesting sites for snowy plovers. The lake is also a stop on the Pacific flyway for many migrant bird species. During the annual migrations, it hosts tens of thousands of eared grebes, Wilson's phalaropes, red-necked phalaropes, American avocets, killdeer, and northern shovelers. black terns, Forster's terns, American avocet, white-faced ibis, Clark's grebes, and black-necked stilts are common during the summer months. Canada geese, snow geese, Ross‚Äô geese and many duck species are also common. Bird counts have recorded over 20,000 ducks at the lake at one time. Over 12,000 ring-billed gulls and California gulls have been counted at the lake as well.Conte, Frank P. and Paul A.

History  Early explorer John C. Fremont The first written record of the lake was made by John Work, the leader of a Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company fur trapping expedition. Work recorded his party‚Äôs visit in his journal on 16 October 1832. In his journal, Work called it Salt Lake. Work‚Äôs journal also implies that other trappers may have been to the lake before his expedition.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Lake Abert\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 552.Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades (Third Edition), Binford & Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, p. 38. Lake Abert was named by Lieutenant John C. Fremont during his 1843 mapping expedition through central and southern Oregon. Fremont and his Army topographical team were mapping the Oregon Territory from The Dalles on Columbia River to Sutter's Fort in the Sacramento Valley of California. Fremont named the lake in honor of Colonel John James Abert, who was chief of the Army's Corps of Topographical Engineers.Bach, Melva M., \\"John C. Fremont\\", History of the Fremont National Forest, Fremont National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Lakeview, Oregon, 1981, pp. 5-9. On 20 December 1843, Fremont described the discovery and naming of Lake Abert as follows: In 1986, there was a large wildfire that burned along the west side of the lake. After the fire, along the shoreline were seeded with a Eurasian species, crested wheatgrass. The remaining acres were left to natural restoration.  Human activity  Today, the Bureau of Land Management is responsible for Lake Abert and the land around it. There is one grazing allotment, that borders the southwest shoreline of the lake, covering of Bureau of Land Management land. The area is semi-arid with bluebunch wheatgrass, cheatgrass, and big sagebrush as the primary vegetation. A 1997 study showed that the grazing practices on the allotment conformed to Federal and state standards. Because of the lake‚Äôs extreme alkalinity, there are no recreational activities that occur on the lake, although kayakers occasionally paddle on the lake. In fact, swimming or extended contact with the lake‚Äôs water would be harmful to humans. There are no developed campgrounds at Lake Abert, but the Bureau of Land Management does allow dispersed camping in the area. The only common recreational activity at Lake Abert is bird watching. A small brine shrimp collection enterprise on Lake Abert was begun in 1979. The brine shrimp‚Äôs high tolerance for salinity and ability to withstand freezing temperature during the winter make brine shrimp the lake‚Äôs only residents. While the brine shrimp harvest from the lake is relatively small, the impact of harvest has never been studied.\\"About our Company\\" , Oregon Desert Brine Shrimp, www.oregondesertbrineshrimp.com, Valley Falls, Oregon, 10 February 2010.

The front mandapam itself is in the form of a huge chariot drawn by horses. The temple has some exquisite stone carvings. The main deity's consort Periya Nayaki Amman temple is situated adjacent to Airavateshwarar temple.Periya Nayaki Amman temple Airavateshwarar temple gopuram The Great Living Chola Temples. (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) at Thanjavur, Gangaikonda Cholapuram and Darasuram were built by the Cholas between the 10th and 12th centuries CE and have a lot of similarities. = Legend = The legend is that Airavata, the white elephant of Indran (Mallas) now pallar, worshipped Lord Siva in this temple; so did also the King of Death, Yama. Tradition has it that the presiding deity Airavateswarar cured Yama himself (the God of Death) who was suffering under a Rishi's curse from a burning sensation all over the body. Yama took a bath in the sacred tank and was rid of the burning sensation. Since then the tank is known as Yamateertham. It gets its supply of fresh water from the river Kaveri and is 228 feet in width. Pilgrims make a point to bathe in the tank. In the recent past Raja Raja Chola worshipped the Siva Lingam in this temple. Volume II of the South Indian Temple Inscriptions deals with a number of endowments of the Pandya Kings also (see pages 556 to 562). On the temple walls these inscriptions are given, from which it is seen that the temple was known in those days as Raja Rajeswararen and Raja Rajapuram. Two such inscriptions are copied here. Airavateshwarar temple Inscription No. 563 at page 557. No. 23 of 1908 on the inner Gopura of the temple, right of entrance. Record dated in the 10th Year, Tai 11, of the reign of the Pandya King Maravarman alias Tribhuvana Chakravartin Srivallabhadeva registering the provision made for repairs and for celebrating festivals in the temple of XXXI Ra (ja) ra (ja) isuram Udaiyanayanar, by the residents of Uttattur-nadu, a sub-division of Kulottungasola-valanadu. Inscription No. 564 at page 558. Record dated in the 31st Year, Makara, Ba. Dvitiya, Uttarashada (probably a mistake for Uttaraphalguna) of the reign of the Chola king Tribhuvana Ghakravartin Sri RAJARAJADEVA registering the grant of land (Irandu Ma mukkani araikkani) 23/160 of a veli to meet the expenses of worship, offerings, etc., to the God by a native of Peruchchalipuram, a village in Kilar-kurram, a sub-division of Pandyakulapati-valanadu. As originally Airavata worshipped the Lingam, the Lingam is named after him as Airavateswara. The Goddess in this temple is known as Deva Nayaki. Whatever remains of the sculptural part of the temple is on the inside wall of the outer prakaram(outer courtyard), about a foot from floor level. 'The carvings contain different poses of gymnastic feats seen in the modern circus, shown by females keeping their head at the centre and legs interwoven in such a skillful way as to form the circumference of a circle. It may be a depiction of the present-day gypsy tribe entertaining villagers with gymnastic shows and dancing poses. Such gypsies are still to be seen visiting the interior villages of the country. Very many styles of physical feats shown by both men and women have been carved in the stone. = Architecture = With heavily ornamented pillars accurate in detail and richly sculpted walls, the Airavateswara temple at Darasuram is a classic example of Chola art and architecture The main mantapa is called Raja Gambira as the elephant draws the chariot. The wheels were put back by the ASI at a later date. The ceiling has a beautiful carving of Shiva and Parvathi inside an open lotus. All the dancing poses of Bharatanatyam are carved in the stone. They are referred to as the Sodasa Upasaras. There is a carving showing the village womenfolk helping in the delivery of another female, who has both her hands on the shoulders of the two ladies, who are pressing their hands and the abdomen of the lady to help her deliver. 'These are very skillful and artistic works of superb style. This may give a glimpse into the social conditions of the past. The stone image of Ravana carrying Kailas is a fine specimen of workmanship. One finds sculptures of Buddha, Bhikshatana, Saraswathi without her Veena, and a sculpture of Ardhanarishvara, Brahma and Surya. It was during this time that Shaivism took a very drastic step and lord Sarabheshwara would seem to have come into existence. Many reasons have been cited for this incarnation of Lord Shiva. Sarabha has the face of a lion and the body of a bird and has placed on his lap the mighty Lord Narasimha. A mantapa has been specially built for lord Sarabha, and thereafter has been installed in temples. The paintings on the walls have been repainted during the Nayak periods. At the very entrance to the temple two Dwarapalakas, Sankhanidhi and Padmanidhi, are imposing figures, giving vivid anatomical expressions of the exuberance of youth. In front of the temple, there is a small mandapa, which can be reached by three steps in the form of a ladder. The steps are stones, which give different musical sounds when tapped. All the seven swaras can be had at different points. It is feared that if proper care is not taken soon, village children will damage the stones. Now these stone steps have been completely covered with metal grills to save them from deterioration. Meanwhile Archeology department has taken many steps to prevent this monument from public viewers and local villagers.  Inundation  Inundated Temple Airavateswara Temple faces problems of inundation after every downpour. Unimaginative municipal planning has resulted in the temple being at a lower elevation than the surrounding roads. This results in inundation during rains.

The Siege of Busanjin was a battle fought at Busan between Japanese and Korean forces on April 14, 1592 (Gregorian: May 24, 1592). The attacks on Busan and the neighboring fort of Dadaejin were the first battles of the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98). Background The Japanese invasion force consisting of 400 transports bearing 18,700 men under the command of Konishi Yukinaga departed from Tsushima Island on April 13 (Gregorian: May 23) and arrived at Busan harbor without any incident. The commander of Busan, Yeong Bal, spotted the invasion fleet while hunting on Yeong Island off Busan Harbor and rushed back to Busan to prepare defenses. A single vessel bearing the daimy≈ç of Tsushima, S≈ç Yoshitoshi (who had been a member of the Japanese mission to Korea in 1589), detached from the Japanese fleet with a letter to the commander of Busan, Jeong Bal, demanding that the Korean forces stand down to allow the Japanese armies to proceed on towards China. The letter went unanswered, and the Japanese commenced landing operations from 0400 the following morning. The Joseon fleet of 150 ships did nothing and sat idle at port while Gyeongsang Left Navy Commander Bak Hong reported to Gyeongsang Right Navy Commander Won Gyun, who thought the invasion might have been a really large trade mission. The commanders of the Japanese forces were Konishi, S≈ç, Matsura Shigenobu, Arima Harunobu, ≈åmura Yoshiaki, and Got≈ç Mototsugu, all of whom (with the exception of Matsura) were Kirishitans, as were many of their men . A portion of this force led by Konishi attacked a nearby fort called Dadaejin, while S≈ç led the main contingent against Busan. Battle To establish a beachhead and control Busan shores, a strategy was planned based on the local knowledge of So Yoshitoshi, lord of Tsushima. The plan consisted of dividing their forces and leading simultaneous attacks against the fort, and subsidiary harbor forts of Tadaejin and Seopyeongpo. Early in the morning of April 14, 1592 (Gregorian: May 24, 1592), S≈ç Yoshitoshi once again called up Joeng Bal to stand down, assuring that he and his men would be safe if they would stand aside and allow the Japanese to pass. Jeong refused, stating that he was dutifully bound to oppose the Japanese advance unless he received orders from Seoul to do otherwise, and the Japanese attack then commenced. While So Yoshitoshi attacked within the main city walls of Busan, Konishi Yukinaga led the assault on the harbor fort of Tadaejin. The Japanese tried to take the south gate of Busan Castle first but took heavy casualties and were forced to switch to the north gate. The Japanese took high ground positions on the mountain behind Busan and shot at Korean defenders within the city with their arquebuss until they created a breach in their northern defenses. The Japanese overwhelmed the Korean defenses by scaling the walls under cover of the arquebuses. This new technology destroyed the Koreans on the walls. Again and again the Japanese would win battles with arquebuses (Korea would not begin to train with these firearms until the Korean General Kim Si-min forged them at a Korean armory). The Koreans retreated to the second line of defense after the surprise attack of So Yoshitoshi. General Jeong Bal (Hangul: Ï†ïÎ∞ú, Hanja :ÈÑ≠Êí•) regrouped the Korean archers and counterattacked. By now, the Koreans had retreated to the third line of defence. After hours of fighting, the Koreans ran out of arrows. The Japanese were taking losses and regrouped to attack again. General Jeong Bal was shot and killed. Morale fell amongst the Korean soldiers and the fort was overrun at around 9:00 in the morning‚Äînearly all of Busan's fighting force was killed. The Japanese massacred the remaining garrison and non-combatants. Not even animals were spared. Yoshitoshi ordered his soldiers to loot and burn valuable items. The Japanese army now occupied Busan. For the next several years Busan would be a supply depot for the Japanese. The Japanese continued to supply troops and food across the sea to Busan until Korean Admiral Yi Sun-sin attacked Busan with his navy. Aftermath Once within the walls of the fortification, the Japanese massacred thousands. \\"Both men, women, and even dogs and cats were beheaded.\\" Per Korean sources, 3,000-8,000 defenders were killed. According to Japanese records, 8,500 Koreans were killed in Busan and 200 were taken prisoner. Gyeongsang Left Navy Commander Bak Hong watched the fall of Busan from a distance. He then scuttled his fleet of 100 ships, which included more than 50 warships armed with cannon, and destroyed his weapons and provisions, so that they would not fall into Japanese hands. Abandoning his men, he fled to Hanseong where he would deliver news of the Japanese invasion to the court. With the fall of Fort Busan, the First Division of the Japanese Army completed its first objective. However, a few miles to the north of Busan lay the fortress of Dongnae; its garrison was a threat to the newly established beachhead. The following day, Konishi Yukinaga and So Yoshitoshi recombined their forces, and then advanced towards the fortress of Dongnae located ten kilometers northeast on the main road to Seoul. These series of lightning-like attacks marked the beginning of the Seven Year War. Legacy With the port in Japanese hands, the area became the primary landing ground for subsequent Japanese deployments to Korea during the Japanese invasion, notably the large army led by Kato Kiyomasa and the slightly smaller army led by Kuroda Nagamasa. It was also the primary Japanese supply base throughout the conflict. To commemorate the battle, there is a statue of Jeong Bal next to the Japanese Consulate in Busan.

He was also known by his nickname Krntija. He was born in ≈†iroka Kula, Gospiƒá municipality, which was part of Austria-Hungary at the time. At the age of 15 he left his impoverished home to earn living as a coal miner in Germany. During World War I he was drafted into Austro-Hungarian Navy. In 1918 he was imprisoned for his role in the sailor's mutiny on the battleship . In 1925 he became a member of Communist Party of Yugoslavia, and a year later he went to Belgrade. In 1929 he was arrested and tortured by Royal Yugoslav police and later sentenced to five years of prison. After serving his sentence he went to Spain to fight in Spanish Civil War on Republican side. He served as political commisar of ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá battalion of International Brigades. After the end of war in 1939 he returned to Yugoslavia where he was appointed in the Central Committee of the Croatian Communist Party. A year later he took part in 5th National Conference of CPY. Soon afterwards he was arrested by authorities and interned in Lepoglava prison. He managed to escape. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and establishment of Independent State of Croatia (NDH), CPY sent Ore≈°koviƒá to organise an armed uprising in his native Lika region. The uprising was successful because the local Serb population suffered persecution by new Ustasha regime and Ore≈°koviƒá with his war experience soon became one of the most popular commanders. However, the insurgents were soon split on the issue whether to engage in combat only with NDH or all Axis forces, including the Italians who offered protection from Ustasha atrocities. This faction, who later became known as Chetniks, was opposed by Ore≈°koviƒá, an ethnic Croat, who wanted insurgence to cross ethnic lines. In October 1941 Ore≈°koviƒá was named as the first political commissar of the Lika Partisan Detachments, and later he became a member of Supreme HQ of Croatia. But, as he then went to Drvar to conference with other insurgent commanders. On his return he was ambushed and shot by members of a local ethnic Serb village guard squad . After the arrival of Partizans, these thugs that were terrorizing the local village, were caught and since different bits of clothing of Marko Ore≈°koviƒá were seen being worn by them, they finally confessed their crime and were shot dead for it . In 1945 he received the title of People's Hero of Yugoslavia.

The population of the civil parish (including Eyres Monsell) was measured at 17,189 in the 2011 census. To the north it runs into Aylestone and to the east South Wigston. To the south and west it is not immediately surrounded by development. Eyres Monsell forms part of the City Of Leicester District but is included in the Parish of Glen Parva (southern part of Eyres Monsell only from south of Sturdee road). Glen Parva forms part of the Leicester Urban Area due to its close proximity to Leicester City Centre. Glen Parva is in the Saxondale ward of Leicestershire. Glen Parva with Eyres Monsell is 4.5 miles south of Leicester City Centre, 1 mile South East Of Fosse Shopping Park that is in Enderby and half a mile from Blaby. It is a largely residential area with no main shopping or leisure centres, although it is situated next to Fosse Shopping Park, which is one of Britain's largest out-of-town shopping parks. There are a few small shops located in Glen Parva itself, mainly being located at Carvers Corner. At Carvers Corner there is a Newsagent, Off Licence, Post Office, Chemist, Barbers, Cob Shop and Accountant. In the surrounding area, there is a beautician and another off licence as well as a working men's club which is for members only. History The original settlement was undoubtedly near The Ford by the River Sence, which is known locally as Glen Ford; and there is strong evidence of the existence of a medieval village in this area. Glen Parva (\\"little Glen\\") is called so to distinguish it from Great Glen (rarely Glen Magna). Under the Local Government Act 1894, Glen Parva became a civil parish within the rural District of Blaby; previously it was included in the Aylestone Ecclesiastical Parish. Glen Parva Barracks, which became an important military installation in the 1960s, were opened in 1881. Eyres Monsell became included in the parish of Glen Parva when the area of land was purchased by Bolton-Eyres Monsell (an area that is named after him), but the land was originally owned by Glen Parva Parish Council so they are responsible along with Leicester City Council for everything in the area. Therefore, Eyres Monsell is an Urban District Of Leicester and is Included In The Leicester Urban Area. Carver's Corner is named after the Carver family, specifically Stephen James Harold Carver & his eldest son Stephen Graham Carver, who owned the row and ran the Post Office & newsagent until the late 1980s. Amenities On the local park there are several facilities including recreational equipment, an astroturf pitch with a football goal and basketball hoop, a library and a recently extended and modernised memorial hall. The hall can now host parties, wedding receptions and other events with its improved facilities. There is also a Scout hut located around the back of the hall which is home to the local 62nd Leicester Scout group. The village has two nurseries and Glen Hill Primary School, which was once split into two campuses: One based at Cork Lane and the other on Featherby Drive, but it was decided that they would be combined on the Featherby site, and Cork Lane's was sold off for housing development. The village has a young offenders' institute, HMYOI Glen Parva. Although this falls within the boundaries of Glen Parva in Blaby district it is separated from the main village by the Birmingham to Peterborough Railway Line and can only be accessed from Tigers Road South Wigston in the borough of Oadby and Wigston. The Knightsbridge Road estate was built as accommodation for the prison officers working at HMYOI Glen Parva. It now has nothing to do with the young offenders' institute and the houses are all privately owned. There is still a footbridge over the railway which can be accessed via an overgrown footpath behind the houses at the end of Knightsbridge Road. This bridge was used to access the young offenders institute from the estate but it is no longer in use and has a locked security gate halfway across preventing access to the prison's perimeter fence. Eyres Monsell Contains two primary schools (Eyres Monsell Primary School) and (Rollsten Primary School). The pork pie library was once a part of the old Eyres Monsell ward but it is now a part of the saffron ward in the city of Leicester along with saffron road and all the roads leading down to Wigston Magna. Landmarks The Grand Union Canal and the River Sence both pass to the south of the village. To the west is the River Soar. The Great Central Railway used to pass through Glen Parva. The route has now been made into a paved Shared path, being part of the National Cycle Network - route 6 which leads directly into Leicester's city centre, which is popular for walking and cycling and is also used by horse riders. Glen Parva Local Nature Reserve is east of the village. Well-known residents *Sue Townsend who wrote the Adrian Mole books grew up in Glen Parva.

His only Test match was against Pakistan at Lucknow in 1952/53, which was one of only two occasions that a matting wicket was used for a Test in India. He returned figures of 3 for 97. Frank Worrell once described Nyalchand as the 'king of matting wickets'. Nyalchand played 24 seasons of Ranji Trophy, half of which were for Saurashtra. He captained Saurashtra for three seasons. His most successful season was 1961/62 when he took 27 wickets, including a split hat- trick against Maharashtra. During this purple patch, he took ten wickets in three consecutive matches across two seasons. Apart from the Test, he appeared for a few times for zonal sides against visiting teams. He toured East Africa with the Sundar Cricket Club of Bombay in 1957. Nyalchand was schooled in Sir Ajitsinhji High School in Dhrangdhara.

Self Portrait (1873) Fyodor Alexandrovich Vasilyev (, 1850 - 1873) was a Russian landscape painter who introduced the lyrical landscape style in Russian art. Biography Fyodor Vasilyev was born in Gatchina to a low-level government official, Alexander Vasilyevich Vasilyev, and Olga Emelyanova Polyntseva on 22 February N.S. 1850. His parents married four years later, so he was always considered an illegitimate child. Feodor had to earn his living from the age of 12 ‚Äì he worked as a mailman, scribe, and assistant to a restorer of pictures. After his father‚Äôs death, he became the sole supporter of the family. In 1863, he managed to enter the evening classes of the School of Painting at the Society for Promotion of Artists (). While at school, Vasilyev got acquainted with many painters, who took care of him. In 1866 famous landscape painter Ivan Shishkin fell in love with Feodor's sister Evgenia Vassilyev. Shishkin became acquainted with Feodor and started to teach him landscape painting. From July to November 1867 Shishkin and Vassilyev worked together on island of Valaam. Some places on Valaam were subjects of both artist's paintings. Later Shishkin introduced Feodor to Ivan Kramskoi, Ilya Repin, and art collectors Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov and Pavel Sergeevich Stroganov. Later Vasilyev became a major competitor to Ivan Shishkin and the latter was often accused of using intrigues and administrative influence trying to win over Vasilyev on different art competitions. Illumination in St. Petersburg. 1869 In Vasilyev‚Äôs early works, such as After a Thunderstorm (1868), Near a Watering Place (1868) and others, one can feel the influence of the Barbizon school; it affected his art but never resulted in a non-creative borrowing of the motifs. Though, at first, Vasilyev was somewhat inferior technically to the Barbizon painters, most critics agree that he eventually found his own way of handling the subject. After a Rain (1869) and After a Rain. Country Road exceed in many respects the Barbizon stormy scenes in their expressiveness and deeply national sound. In 1870, Vasilyev traveled on the Volga with Ilya Repin, the picture Volga View. Barges(1870) was a great success. In 1870 he became a member of Peredvizhniki movement (one of the original twenty members). In 1871, Vasilyev painted Thaw (1871), which made him famous immediately. The tzar family's (Prince Alexander, future Alexander III of Russia), ordered a copy, and the Society for Promotion of Artists awarded him first prize. Later Prince Alexander's copy was exponated on the 1872 London World Fair and won a medal. Vasilyev was admitted, as an intern, to the Imperial Academy of Arts (which, among other things, gave him an exception from conscription to the Army). Wet Meadow 1872 The \\"boy genius\\", as he was called in the artistic circles of Russia, had no time to enjoy his popularity ‚Äì he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and had to leave St. Petersburg forever. He moved to Crimea. The Society for Promotion of Artists sponsored his stay there, but he was obliged to pay with his paintings. Vasilyev could not get used to the new scenery. He went on to paint the Russian plains; his works, such as his masterpiece Wet Meadow (1872), were done from memory, old sketches and his imagination. After some time Vasilyev started to draw Crimea, gradually beginning to feel the attraction to its mountain views. Mountains of Crimea (1873) was an outstanding work and the last work of the artist. He died in Yalta on 6 October N.S. 1873 at the age of 23. His posthumous exhibition in Saint Petersburg was a great success, and all his works were sold prior to the exhibition. His works had a strong influence on the next generation of Russian landscape painters. Nikolai Ge said, He discovered for us the Sky. Many art historians emphasize Fedor Vasilyev's influence on Isaac Levitan, Valentin Serov, Viktor Borisov-Musatov.

In 2017, it was estimated to have a population of 80,000, including several displaced by fighting in neighbouring towns. It is located on the highway between Aleppo and Hama and near the Dead Cities of Bara and Serjilla. The city, known as Arra to the Greeks, has its present-day name combined from the Aramaic word for cave and that of its first Muslim governor, Nu'man ibn Bashir al-Ansari, a companion of Muhammad, meaning ‚Äúthe Cave of Nu‚Äôman.‚Äù The Crusaders called it Marre. There are many towns throughout Syria with names that begin with the word Maarat, such as Ma'arrat Misrin and Maarat Saidnaya. Today the city has a museum with mosaics from the Dead Cities, a Friday mosque, a madrassa built by Abu al-Farawis in 1199, and remains of the medieval citadel. The city is the birthplace of the poet Al-Ma øarri (973‚Äì1057). History =Abbasids to Fatimids (891‚Äì1086)= In 891 Ya‚Äòqubi described Maarrat al-Nu‚Äòman as \\"an ancient city, now a ruin. It lies in the Hims province.\\"le Strange, 1890, p. 495 By the time of Estakhri (951) the place had recovered, as he described the city \\"very full of good things, and very opulent\\". Figs, pistachios and vines were cultivated. In 1047 Nasir Khusraw visited the city, and described it as a populous town with a stone wall. There was a Friday Mosque, on a height, in the middle of the town. The bazaars were full of traffic. Considerable areas of cultivated land surrounded the town, with plenty of fig-trees, olives, pistachios, almonds and grapes.le Strange, 1890, p. 496 =Crusader Ma‚Äòarra massacre (1098)= The most infamous event from the city's history dates from late 1098, during the First Crusade. After the Crusaders, led by Raymond de Saint Gilles and Bohemond of Taranto, successfully besieged Antioch they found themselves with insufficient supplies of food. Their raids on the surrounding countryside during the winter months did not help the situation. By December 12 when they reached Ma‚Äòarra, many of them were suffering from starvation and malnutrition. They managed to breach the city's walls and massacred about 8,000 inhabitants. However, this time, as they could not find enough food, they resorted to cannibalism. One of the crusader commanders wrote to Pope Urban II: \\"A terrible famine racked the army in Ma‚Äòarra, and placed it in the cruel necessity of feeding itself upon the bodies of the Saracens. Radulph of Caen, another chronicler, wrote: \\"In Ma‚Äòarra our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking-pots; they impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled.\\"Amin Maalouf, The Crusades Through Arab Eyes, trans. Jon Rothschild (News York: Schocken Books, 1984), 39. These events were also chronicled by Fulcher of Chartres, who wrote: \\"I shudder to tell that many of our people, harassed by the madness of excessive hunger, cut pieces from the buttocks of the Saracens already dead there, which they cooked, but when it was not yet roasted enough by the fire, they devoured it with savage mouth.\\"Edward Peters, The First Crusade: The Chronicle of Fulcher of Chartres and Other Source Materials (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1998), 84. Among the European records of the incident was the French poem 'The Leaguer of Antioch', which contains such lines as, :Then came to him the King Tafur, and with him fifty score :Of men-at-arms, not one of them but hunger gnawed him sore. :Thou holy Hermit, counsel us, and help us at our need; :Help, for God's grace, these starving men with wherewithal to feed. :But Peter answered, 'Out, ye drones, a helpless pack that cry, :While all unburied round about the slaughtered Paynim lie. :A dainty dish is Paynim flesh, with salt and roasting due. : From \\"The Leaguer of Antioch\\"Von Sybel; History and Literature of the Crusades; translated by Lady Duff Gordon Those events had a strong impact on the local inhabitants of Southwest Asia. The crusaders already had a reputation for cruelty and barbarism towards Muslims, Jews and even local Christians, Catholic and Orthodox alike (the Crusades began shortly after the Great Schism of 1054). The accuracy of the events described by the contemporary writers have been disputed. The famine and cannibalism are recognised but the torture and killing of Muslim captives for cannibalism by Radulph of Caen are very unlikely since there are no Arab or Muslim records of the events. Had they occurred, they would have undoubtedly been recorded. This has been noted by the BBC Timewatch series, the episode The Crusades: A Timewatch Guide, which included the experts Dr Thomas Asbridge and Muslim Arab historian Dr Fozia Bora, who states Radulph of Caen's description does not appear in Muslim contemporary chronicles., =Late medieval period= Ibn al- Muqaddam received lands in Maarat al-Nu øman in 1179 as part of his compensation for yielding Baalbek to Saladin's brother Turan Shah. Ibn Jubayr passed by the town in 1185, and wrote that \\"Everywhere around the town are gardens... It is one of the most fertile and richest lands in the world\\". Ibn Battuta visited in 1355, and described the town as small. The figs and pistachios of the town were exported to Damascus.le Strange, 1890, p. 497 =Syrian Civil War (2011‚Äìongoing)= The town was the focus of intense protests against the government of President Bashar al-Assad on 2 June 2011. On 25 October 2011, clashes occurred between loyalists and defected soldiers at a roadblock on the edge of the town. The defectors launched an assault on the government held roadblock in retaliation for a raid on their positions the previous night. The Free Syrian Army took control in December 2011‚ÄìJanuary 2012. The regime recaptured it at a later date. On 10 June 2012, the FSA took it back, but the military recaptured it in August. Finally the FSA captured the town again in October after the Battle of Maarrat al-Nu'man. As the Syrian Civil War followed, the town's strategic position on the road between Damascus and Aleppo made it a significant prize. Starting on 8 October 2012, the Battle of Maarrat al-Nu'man was fought between the FSA and the government, causing numerous civilian casualties and severe material damage. The town was home to the FSA Division 13. A hospital in Maarrat al-Nu'man was struck by missiles on 15 February 2016.

Molon ( or ) or Molo (; ; died 220 BC) was a general and satrap of the Seleucid king Antiochus the Great (223-187 BC). He held the satrapy of Media at the accession of that monarch (223 BC); in addition to which, Antiochus conferred upon him and his brother Alexander the government of all the upper provinces of his empire. But their hatred of Hermeias, the chief minister of Antiochus, soon led them both to revolt in 222 BC. The two generals at first sent against them by the king were unable to oppose their progress, and Molon found himself at the head of a large army, and master of the whole country to the east of the Tigris. He was, however, foiled in his attempts to pass that river by Zeuxis.http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/5*.html#43 Polybius, 5,43 However, Xenoetas, the general of Antiochus, who was now sent against him with a large force, having ventured to cross it in his turn, was surprised by Molon, and his whole army cut to pieces. The rebel satrap now crossed the Tigris, and made himself master of the city of Seleucia on the Tigris together with the whole of Babylonia and Mesopotamia. The formidable character of the insurrection now at last prompted Antiochus to march in person against the rebels. After wintering at Nisibis, he crossed the Tigris in 220 BC, and advanced southwards against Molon, who marched from Babylon to meet him. The right wing of Antiochus' army was commanded by Ardys. A pitched battle ensued, in which the desertion of the left wing of the rebel army at once decided the victory in favour of the king. Molon committee suicide to avoid capture, but at the urging Antiochus' minister Hermeias his body was crucified. References *Polybius; Histories, Evelyn S.

The hospital is managed by the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and is a teaching hospital for Newcastle University. History The Freeman Hospital, which was designed by Newcastle Regional Hospital Department and built by John Laing, was completed in 1977, when services from several hospitals across the city were relocated into one centre. The name of the hospital recalls the life of Patrick Freeman, a tenant farmer, who, with his son, tilled the land which is now occupied by the hospital in the first half of the 19th century. A major expansion of the site, including a new renal services centre and a new cancer treatment centre, known as the new Northern Centre for Cancer Care, was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2005. It was built by Laing O'Rourke at a cost of ¬£150 million and opened in 2009.  Services  The hospital is one of the main organ transplantation hospitals in the United Kingdom, mostly well known for its successful rates of infant cardiology and transplantation for adults. In 1987 the UK's first paediatric heart transplant was carried out on Kaylee Davidson-Olley, at the Freeman. It is funded and designated by the government as the UK's third transplant hospital. It made history when both the first successful single and double lung transplants in Europe were carried out at the hospital in 1990. The Freeman is the location of the Institute of Transplantation. The Northern Cancer Centre is also home to the Bobby Robson clinical trials unit which specialises in oncology clinical trials.

It was an important Middle Kingdom town, which was enlarged during the Eighteenth Dynasty. It is located today in the Luxor Governorate on the west bank of the Nile. History Montu was an Egyptian god whose root of name means \\"nomad\\". Montu was associated with raging bulls, strength and war. He was also said to manifest himself in a white bull with a black face, which was referred to as the Bakha. Egypt's greatest general-kings called themselves Mighty Bulls, the sons of Montu.

Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II is the earliest builder known with certainty. Important additions were made during the Twelfth dynasty and during the New Kingdom. Destroyed during the Late Period, a new temple was started in the reign of Nectanebo II and was continued by the Ptolemies. Cleopatra VII and Ptolemy XV Caesarion added a birth house with a sacred lake. The building remained visible until the nineteenth century, when it was recycled to build a sugar factory.

He competed in four consecutive Summer Olympics where he won two gold medals (1952, 1956) and one silver medal (1960). In his last Olympic competition (1964) he placed fourth. For all of these accomplishments, O'Brien was inducted into the IAAF and U.S. Olympic halls of fame. Biography Born in Santa Monica, California, O'Brien was very active in sports at Santa Monica High School, playing end on the football team that won the California state championship in 1948. He was then awarded an athletic scholarship in football to the University of Southern California. He also won the (non-standard for high schoolers) 16-pound shot put competition at the 1949 CIF California State Meet. He also finished in third place that year putting the standard 12-pound shot for high schoolers. O'Brien enrolled in college at U.S.C., where he continued to play football as a freshman until he was kicked in the stomach during practice and injured. He then decided to concentrate on track and field, for the shot put and the discus throw). In the early 1950s, O'Brien developed a new method for putting the 16-pound shot. The Los Angeles Times described it: > When O'Brien began throwing the shot, the standard method was to rock back > on one leg, swing the other in front for balance, hop forward and propel the > iron ball forward. O'Brien instead began by facing the back of the circle. > He then turned 180 degrees, using the spin to generate momentum and help him > throw the shot greater distances. Using this method he was able to break the world record in the shot put 17 times, becoming the first man to put the 16-pound shot more than 60 feet, and winning 116 consecutive meets in the shot put. This method became known as \\"O'Brien Style\\" or the \\"O'Brien Glide.\\" He held the world record from 1953 to 1959. During his career he won 18 Amateur Athletic Union championships (combined outdoor and indoor), 17 in the shot put, plus one in the discus. He won nine consecutive national indoor shot put championships, and he won eight overall outdoors, including five in a row. As a competitor, in addition to developing new techniques for the shot put, he also made motivational tapes for himself, and experimented with Yoga. Time magazine, in a cover storyParry O'Brien. Time Magazine, December 3, 1956 written during the week before the Melbourne Olympics, noted \\"None has been more successful than O'Brien in combining what he calls \\"M.A.\\" (mental attitude) and \\"P.A.\\" (physical aptitude).\\" He was the first man to retain his Olympic shot put title since Ralph Rose of the United States did so in 1904 and 1908. During the 1960 Summer Olympics, O'Brien won the silver medal in one of the rare track meets that he did not win. In 1964, O'Brien was the flag bearer for the American Olympic Team at the Tokyo Olympic Games.United States. sports-reference.com O'Brien entered the National Track and Field Hall of Fame of the United States in 1974. Next he was chosen for the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 1984, and then the Univ. of Southern California Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994. After retiring from senior competitions O'Brien worked in the banking and real estate business in Southern California. He remained active in masters athletics, and he put a six kilogram shot 58'1¬Ω \\" (17.72 m) at age 50 in 1984. This distance, two feet further than the listed American Masters record in his age division is still pending. Later in the 1990s he began swimming because athletics put too much stress on his joints. O'Brien died of a heart attack in the 500 yard freestyle swimming pool at the Santa Clarita Aquatics club while he was competing in a Southern Pacific Masters Association regional swimming competition. He was 75 years old. He was survived by his wife Terri, stepsons Erik Skorge and Norman Skorge, and daughters Shauna and Erin.

There is an electoral ward in the same name. The population at the 2011 census was 1,886. The village takes its name from Thurlestone Rock, the so-called \\"thirled stone\\", an arch-shaped rock formation just offshore in Thurlestone Bay. The village's All Saints church is built of the dark grey local slate. The chancel is early 13th century; the remainder of the church 15th and 16th century. Thurlestone Marsh Thurlestone Marsh () is one of three small wetlands south of the village (South Milton Ley and South Huish Marsh are the others). It is formed where a small unnamed stream flows through low-lying flat farmland just inland from Leas Foot Sand, a small beach just to the southwest of the village. The site consists of a number of reed-fringed pools. Tourism Some companies rent out self-catering houses, as an alternative to staying in the hotel, in the village. About 60% of houses in the village are rented out at some time in the year. Shops and accommodation The church of All Saints Thurlestone has some retail and accommodation, they include: * A post office * A large hotel * A golf course * An inn * A church Wildlife In 2002, a 30-year-old female pygmy sperm whale was washed up on Thurlestone Beach. 2005 saw two significant ornithological events (Devon Bird Report 2005): * In late March and early April, a flock of 68 garganey was offshore in the bay ‚Äì the second largest flock ever to be recorded in Britain (the largest was a flock of 120 in Kent in the 1950s). * In August, a least sandpiper, a North American vagrant shorebird only recorded once in Devon previously, was present on Thurlestone Marsh. Walks There is a walk from the main village to Bantham and another walk to Salcombe going through Hope Cove and bolberry . Both of these are along the headland. There are also a numerous walks to nearby beaches and villages.

He was one of only 2 (arguably 3) known survivors. His own description of the morning of 8 May 1902 follows. > \\"I felt a terrible wind blowing, the earth began to tremble, and the sky > suddenly became dark. I turned to go into the house, with great difficulty > climbed the three or four steps that separated me from my room, and felt my > arms and legs burning, also my body. I dropped upon a table.

Rescuers found him and sent him to the town of Fort-de-France, where he was labeled as a madman. Shortly thereafter, he was deputized by the police, given a gun and sent to protect the ruins from looters. After a week of duty, he left the city on 20 May and started back towards Fort-de-France. He barely escaped a second death cloud. He eventually settled in the village of Morne Rouge, only to have another cloud pour through on 30 August. He was again one of the few who survived. He lived on the island until his death in 1936 from a fall. The most scientifically viable theory is that Leon jumped into the ocean when the flow hit, and while the now boiling water severely burned him, he otherwise escaped unharmed; other accounts suggest that he survived by \\"napping in [his] wood cellar\\" or managed to outrun the pyroclastic flow (the latter being entirely unlikely). Some accounts claim L√©on Comp√®re-L√©andre was Caucasian, whilst others claim he was a mulatto. The other two survivors (depending on how one defines the term) are Louis-Auguste Cyparis (aka Ludger Sylbaris), a convicted felon who was pardoned and later joined P. T. Barnum's circus, and Havivra Da Ifrile, a little girl.

The original broadcast was on the TVB Jade network with 45-minute episodes airing five days a week from 20 December 1999 to 16 January 2000. The drama stars Bobby Au-yeung as the famous historical forensic medical expert Song Ci (\\"Sung Chee\\" in Cantonese romanisation). Set during the Southern Song Dynasty of Mid- Imperial China, Witness to a Prosecution tells a fictionalised account of Chee's modest beginnings and the events leading to the creation of his book Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified, the world's earliest documentation of forensic science. Witness to a Prosecution was met with positive reviews and quickly became a popular success. Viewership ratings were consistently high, and the drama was the seventh most-viewed drama in 2000, drawing an average of 33 rating points, peaking at 44 points.TVB's Top 10 Dramas (1997‚Äì2009) The drama also yielded Au-yeung a \\"Best Actor\\" win at the 2000 TVB Anniversary Awards. A subsequent sequel was released in 2003, airing on the same channel from 24 February to 23 March 2003. Although viewership ratings peaked higher to 47 points, it was met with mixed reviews. Synopsis For 30 years, nighttime keeper Song Ci (Bobby Au-yeung) was despised in To Yuen village due to his posthumous birth in a coffin, having only the sickly scholar Sit Dan (Michael Tse) and the coolie Cha Siu-chaan (Lo Mang) as his friends. After disputing with the village chief over his family's land, Ci, along with a homeless female thief Tong Sze (Jessica Hsuan), are accused for murdering the chief and are sentenced to death. The village's newly appointed magistrate Sung Yik (Frankie Lam) finds the case suspicious and investigates. With the help of the mysterious yet experienced coroner Ma Kwai (Lau Kong), Yik successfully revokes Ci and Sze's sentences. Kwai becomes Ci's coroner master and Yik employs Ci to be his personal forensic medical doctor. The two become good friends and partners, successfully solving many murder cases in town. Sze develops a crush on Yik, unaware that Yik and Nip Fung (Mariane Chan), daughter of senior constable Nip Yan-lung (Gordon Liu), are already in a relationship. Ci, on the other hand, falls for Lam Choi-dip (Eileen Yeow), the spoiled daughter of rich merchant Lam To (Lee Lung-kei). Choi-dip, however, has her eyes on Yik. Several months later, a man also by the name of Sung Yik shows up and confronts Yik, calling him a traitor. After the two intensely quarrel, the fake Yik accidentally kills the real Sung Yik. In a panic, he buries Sung Yik's body in the garden of the Sung family rice shop. Yik's relatives then mysteriously die one by one; Ci eventually uncovers the body of the real Sung Yik and begins to grow suspicious of the current Yik, a man whom he has always respected and treated as a friend.

Historically part of Staffordshire, it is situated north-north-west of the city centre, within the Oxley ward of Wolverhampton City Council. At the 2011 Census, the population of Pendeford was 5,826, increasing from 4,356 at the 2001 Census. A panoramic image of Pendeford Square  Name and origins  The first known written recording of the place name 'Pendeford', was in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it was recorded with the same spelling as today ‚Äì a rarity for place names. The name is thought by many toponymists'The Place-Names of Staffordshire' ‚Äì David Horovitz to mean 'Penda's Ford', possibly a crossing over the nearby River Penk named after the Anglo-Saxon King, Penda of Mercia who reigned in Mercia from the year 626. Despite the origin of the name not being set in stone, the recording of the place name in the Domesday Book tells us that Pendeford was in existence at the time of the Norman conquest, and that at the time, Pendeford was held by two Englishmen, Ulstan and Godwin. After the conquest, the land was confiscated and given to a Norman knight called William Fitz-Ansculf, as a reward for serving William the Conqueror. At this point in time, Pendeford would have been little more than a few scattered buildings amongst woodland, bordered on its eastern side by a lake known in more recent times as Alleycroft Lake (the lake no longer exists, having been drained upon the construction of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal during the 18th century, though a marshy area remains on the site of the new I54 project to the north of Wobaston Road). Pendeford lay near the farthest south-west reaches of Cannock forest, which was much larger than today in early medieval times. =Location= Despite the modern day Pendeford, with the housing estates Dovecotes, Pendeford Park and Pendford Rise being within the Wolverhampton city border, parts of Dovecotes Estate are within South Staffordshire boundaries. The former site of Pendeford Hall, today the Pendeford Hall Residential Park, constructed after the demolition of the hall in 1968, as well as Pendeford Mill Nature Reserve are in South Staffordshire. The new i54 site is a joint project of Wolverhampton City Council, South Staffordshire District Council and Staffordshire County Council.  History  Pendeford's history dates back to at least the 11th century: a record about it exists in William the Conqueror's Domesday Book. Dovecotes (Barnhurst) was also part of Pendeford, as was Aldersley. = The brook = The area has a small brook running through it, but it has been moved and culverted. The majority of the brook now runs underground, although it is above ground next to the subway which goes underneath Blaydon Road. It then carries on for around quarter of a mile before disappearing back underground next to Marholm Close. = Pendeford Airfield = In the 1930s, Wolverhampton Council decided to establish an airfield at Pendeford, on of land at Barnhurst formerly used for sewage disposal. The airfield was officially opened on 27 June 1938, by which time Boulton Paul Aircraft had established a factory there. Boulton Paul had separated from its parent in Norwich to move to an area with a suitable workforce to take advantage of the Government Aircraft Expansion Scheme, starting work on their new factory in October 1935. The first Wolverhampton- built aircraft was a sub-contracted Hawker Demon, making a flight in August 1936.Gordon Kinsey Boulton & Paul Aircraft p71-75 Boulton Paul also built their own designs including the Defiant fighter (which had its first flight at Pendeford in August 1937, almost a year before the airfield was officially opened). During the Second World War the airfield was also used for training air force pilots, with over 100 de Havilland Tiger Moths stationed there at one stage. No.28 Elementary Flying Training School commenced operations at Pendeford on 15 September 1941 and was operated for the Royal Air Force by Air Schools Ltd. It was renamed No.25 Reserve Flying School on 26 June 1947, and ceased to operate on 31 March 1953. Aircraft at Pendeford Airfield in 1950 showing the black Bellman-type wartime hangars and the airfield control tower (right). Post-war, the airfield was used for private and training aircraft, with limited scheduled services from 1953.Pendeford Airfield, Wolverhampton History and Heritage website , accessed 28 February 2010. In 1950, the airfield hosted the prestigious Kings Cup air race. By the end of the 1960s the airfield was losing money and there were safety concerns over its close proximity to houses, and the airfield was closed on 31 December 1970. Remaining aircraft transferred to Halfpenny Green airport to the southwest of Wolverhampton. A memorial to the airfield can be seen on the walls of an estate within Pendeford. Shortly before the airfield's closure, on 9 April 1970, a de Havilland Dove crashed onto a house in Redhurst Drive, Fordhouses and caught fire.Accidents Investigation Branch Report of the investigation into the crash of Dove G-AVHV retrieved 28 February 2010. The crew of the aircraft (which was owned by Dowty Group, by then the owner of Boulton Paul) were attempting to land at the airfield in poor weather; the accident investigation determined that the aircraft stalled at a height too low for the crew to regain control. An occupant of the house and the two people on board the aircraft were killed in the accident; two more escaped the burning house by jumping out of an upstairs window and were slightly injured. =Film location, 1956= In April 1956, the Ealing Studios feature film, The Man in the Sky, starring Jack Hawkins and Elizabeth Sellars, was shot in and around the Pendeford and Oxley areas of Wolverhampton, the majority at Pendeford Airfield. = Flooding of 1999 = On Monday 5 July 1999 the Wolverhampton area was hit by storms which included a twister. This caused torrential flooding across Pendeford with water reaching depths of in places. Just as families were recovering from the \\"twister\\" storms, some faced second insurance claims for new damage to their properties when a second storm hit on Sunday 1 August. Residents were ferried to safety on inflatable rafts by firemen as flood water up to deep from torrential rain swept into their homes. Temporary accommodation was made available at Pendeford High School.https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-60493280http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/410611.stm = IWA National Festival 08 = During August Bank Holiday 2008 (23‚Äì25 August), the Inland Waterways Association held their National Festival at Pendeford. Over 300 boats, with 300 tents and caravans attended, accompanied by over 250 exhibitors, and the site was visited over the weekend by some 24,000 people. The playing fields behind Halesworth Road and Emsworth Crescent were used for the exhibitions and car parking.  Housing  Today, most of the area is a housing estate built during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The first section to be built was Dovecotes Estate, named 'Dovecotes' because of the old dovecote that still stands to this day, on land that was previously Barnhurst Farm, followed by Pendeford Park and new housing on the north-east side of the Shropshire Union Canal, such as the 'Penwood' estate at Clewley Drive. The newest part of Pendeford, known as 'Richmond Park', was completed in the late 1990s with 'Pendeford Rise' being completed in the early 1990s. All of the estate has been built on the site of the former Wolverhampton Aerodrome, the Boulton Paul Ltd aircraft factory and Barnhurst Farm.  Shopping and amenities  Pendeford has a large Morrisons (previously Safeway (UK)) supermarket and several smaller shops which include Sally's Beauty Accessories, Home and Motorsave and Martins (previously Dillons and before that Preedy). Until recently, a Choices Movie Rental store sat next to Morrisons, but this has now closed & is now part of a small extension to Morrisons. Nearby, in Pendeford Square, there is the Priory Green Community Centre, Library, Health Centre, Oasis Cafe, Church/School, Nelson Mandela House Nursing Home and Cresswell Court Residential Home. There is also a small shopping centre on Dovecotes Estate named 'The Haymarket', with a Premier Store named Pendeford Superstore (previously Spar), a Chinese take-away, fish & chip shop (Pendeford Fish Bar) and a chicken shop selling to the public (Dovecote's Poultry).http://www.192.com/places/wv/wv8-1/wv8-1xe/ .  Public houses  There is currently only one pub in Pendeford, called the Pendulum. This can be located near the entrance of the shopping centre car park on Blaydon Road. 'The Pendulum' has a bar & lounge area, as well as benches outside. It regularly shows sport, and also has a food menu. Fordhouses Cricket Club (formerly Dowty's until the late 1990s) is situated on the border of Pendeford & Wobaston / Fordhouses, on Wobaston Road. As the name would suggest, Fordhouses Cricket Club is located there. As well as the sports aspect, it is a social club which requires a yearly membership to gain access. On a Sunday night there is live entertainment in the form of a singer / band / disco / comedian, as well as a bingo session in the main room. There is also an adjacent bar room with snooker tables. Previously there was a pub in Dovecotes called the Dovecote at Ryefield, though this closed in the mid 2000s and after a refurbishment became Pendeford Seventh-day Adventist Church in 2006.  Education  There are two primary schools in Pendeford ‚Äì St Paul's Church of England Aided Primary School, which is situated in the Pendeford Square near the local amenities, and Dovecotes Primary School on Dovecotes Estate. Nearby in neighbouring Oxley, is Rakegate Primary School. There are also two high schools nearby on opposite borders of Pendeford ‚Äì Alderlsey High School to the west and Pendeford Business and Enterprise College to the east. A third school, Priory Green Primary School, existed until relatively recently, but was shut down due to an ofsted report. The school building are now used by Wolverhampton City Social Services.http://www.yell.com/biz/safeguarding-service- wolverhampton-2016237/?view=map = St Paul's Church of England Aided Primary School = St Paul's School opened in Pendeford on 25 January 1982. The church was established within the school later that year. The church font, which dates back to Norman times, was placed in the chapel after being moved from St. Michael's Church in Tettenhall. In 1987 a new porch was built at the entrance to the church where a cross and bell were added at a cost of ¬£7,000. Today the church is still located partially inside St Paul's Primary School however in 2005 a new chapel was built and it is now accessible during the daytime. The \\"Oasis\\" community caf√©, built as an extension to the church/school building, was opened in September 2005. = Priory Green Primary School = Priory Green was originally opened as Priory Green Infant School in 1981 and Priory Green Junior School in 1984. Following the departure of Mr Colin Edwards, the headmaster of Priory Green Primary School, a decision was made to merge the two schools and create a combined primary school under the former headmistress of the Infant school, Ms Pursehouse. This happened in c.1997. Priory Green Primary School was placed under special measures in 2009, and the school closed at the end of the 2009/2010 academic year on 31 August 2010, allowing the neighbouring school, St Paul's, some of the land. = Dovecotes Primary School = Dovecotes Primary School is located within the neighbouring estate of Dovecotes. There are pupils from Pendeford who also attend this school. Dovecotes Infants School opened in 1978 with Dovecotes Junior School being built in 1979. = Rakegate Primary School = Rakegate Primary School is located within the adjoining estate of Oxley. Like Dovecotes Primary School there are pupils from Pendeford who attend this school. The original school was built in the 1950s but has since been redeveloped and is now a brand new 21st century modern primary school which opened in 2007 for the 2007/2008 academic year. Like Priory Green, Rakegate was originally an Infants and Junior school but became a new Primary School in 2003 for the 2003/2004 academic year. = Aldersley High School = Aldersley High School is situated on Barnhurst Lane, and is school of choice for the majority of children from the Dovecotes area. Despite the name, Aldersley High School is not in Aldersley, but straddles the Wolverhampton / South Staffordshire border on the western edge of Pendeford, surrounded on two sides by countryside. = North East Wolverhampton Academy = Previously known as 'Pendeford High School', it started life as a comprehensive school in September 1968. It was created by merger of two separate schools, Wobaston Secondary School and Wolverhampton Grammar Technical School. Wobaston Secondary School transferred to its new building in 1957 which was known as 'lower school'. It had however existed on this site since 1942. The school then went by the name of Fordhouses Senior Mixed School using the old huts between the two buildings and the buildings near the tennis courts which were used for woodwork and are now the Pendeford Youth Club. The air-raid shelters were kept for a time as a reminder of a different age. The Grammar Technical School, previously known as the Technical High School and before that the Intermediate School, transferred from its central Wolverhampton site in Old Hall Street in 1963 to the building which was known as 'upper school'. Finally in 1968 the two buildings were merged and renamed Pendeford High school. In a similar way to Aldersley High School, Pendeford High School is actually situated just outside Pendeford, in the Wobaston / Fordhouses area. The school was renamed Pendeford Business and Enterprise College after gaining specialist status as a Business and Enterprise College. In September 2010 the school merged with Northicote School. The new combined school was named North East Wolverhampton Academy, and was originally located over both former school sites before relocating to a newly constructed and refurbished campus in September 2014 at the former Pendeford Business and Enterprise College site. The sculpture near the front entrance of the Lower School is made from Portland stone and sculptured by John Paddison, a former pupil of the Technical High School and a former lecturer in the Fine Art department of the Wolverhampton Polytechnic, also a Fish pond was also installed in an courtyard near the assembly hall in Upper School  Transport links  Pendeford Rockin', a narrow cutting in the sandstone on the Staffordshire & Worcestershire Canal Autherley Junction to the south of Pendeford is the junction of the Shropshire Union Canal and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal.

Charles rode an old horse that had been provided by the miller, Humphrey Pendrell. During the journey, the horse stumbled, leading Humphrey Pendrell to joke that it was \\"not to be wondered at, for it had the weight of three Kingdoms upon its back\\". At Pendeford Mill, the party stopped and Charles dismounted, it being deemed unsafe to continue riding. Three of the Pendrell brothers took the horse back, while Richard and John Pendrell along with Francis Yates continued with Charles to Moseley Hall.

Its capital is Bareilly city and it is divided in six administrative division or tehsils: Aonla, Baheri, Bareilly city, Faridpur, Mirganj, and Nawabganj. The Bareilly district is a part of the Bareilly Division and occupies an area of 4120 km¬≤ with a population of 4,448,359 people (previously it was 3,618,589) according to the census of 2011.http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/0919_PART_B_DCHB_BAREILLY.pdf The region was a part of the Delhi Sultanate before getting absorbed by the emerging Mughal Empire. The modern City of Bareilly was founded by Mukrand Rai in 1657. Later it became the capital of the Rohilkhand region before getting handed over to Nawab Vazir of Awadh and then to the East India Company, becoming an integral part of India. History =Ancient period= Historically, the region was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Panchala. The Panchalas occupied the country to the east of the Kurus, between the upper Himalayas and the river Ganges. The country was divided into Uttara-Panchala and Dakshina-Panchala. The northern Panchala had its capital at Ahichatra (also known as Adhichhatra and Chhatravati, near present-day Aonla) tehsil of Bareilly district, while southern Panchala had it capital at Kampilya or Kampil in Farrukhabad district. The famous city of Kannauj or Kanyakubja was situated in the kingdom of Panchala. According to the epic MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, Bareilly region (Panchala, in present - day Uttar Pradesh and nearby regions) is said to be the birthplace of Draupadi, who was also referred to as 'Panchali'. Iron Age Vedic India. The last two Panchala clans, the Somakas and the Srinjayas are mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Puranas. King Drupada, whose daughter Draupadi was married to the Pandavas belonged to the Somaka clan.Pargiter, F.E. (1972). Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.117 However, the Mahabharata and the Puranas consider the ruling clan of the northern Panchala as an offshoot of the Bharata clan. Divodasa, Sudas, Srinjaya, Somaka and Drupada (also called Yajnasena) were the most notable rulers of this clan.Raychaudhuri, H.C. (1972) Political History of Ancient India, Calcutta: University of Calcutta, pp.65‚Äì8. During 176 ‚Äì 166 BC, Panchala coins were minted at Bareilly and the surrounding areas. It was the Kushan and Gupta kings who established mints here. The city's continued status as a mint town since the beginning of the Christian era was helped by the fact that Bareilly was never a disturbed area (except at the time of the Indian Independence Struggle). Found at Ganga Ghati in abundance were the Adi Vigraha and Shree Vigraha coins of the Pratihara Kings that were minted here between the 4th to the 9th centuries. Dating to this period are also the silver coins ‚Äî similar to those of Firoz Second ‚Äî known as Indo-Sasanian. =Medieval period= After the fall of the Kingdom of Panchala, the City was under the rule of local rulers. In the twelfth century, it was ruled by different clans of Rajputs referred to by the general name of Katehriyas Rajputs.When the Ain-i-Akbari was compiled (c 1595-6), Katiher was largely held by Rajputs of different clans such as Bachal, Gaur, Chauhan and Rathor. See Iqbal Husain, op. cit., p. 6. According to British historian Matthew Atmore Sherring the district of Bareilly was formerly a dense jungle inhabited by a race of Ahirs and was called Tappa Ahiran.Hindu Tribes and Castes, Volume 1 page 334 In the beginning of the thirteenth century, when the Delhi Sultanate was firmly established, Katehr was divided into the provinces of Sambhal and Budaun. But the thickly forested country infested with wild animals provided just the right kind of shelter for rebels. And indeed, Katehr was famous for rebellions against imperial authority. During the Sultanate rule, there were frequent rebellions in Katehr. All were ruthlessly crushed. Sultan Balban (1266‚Äì1287) ordered vast tracts of jungle to be cleared so as to make the area unsafe for the insurgents. The slightest weakening of the central authority provoked acts of defiance from the Katehriya Rajputs. Thus the Mughals initiated the policy of allotting lands for Afghan settlements in Katiher.Iqbal Husain, op. cit., p. 97. Afghan settlements continued to be encouraged throughout the reign of Aurangzeb (1658‚Äì1707) and even after his death. These Afghans, known as the Rohilla Afghans, caused the area to be known as Rohilkhand.Bahadur Khan Ruhela and Diler Khan Ruhela were important nobles at the court of the Mughal Emperor Shahjahan. As a reward for defeating the Katehriyas a perpetual grant of 14 villages was conferred upon Bahadur Khan who asked his brother Diler Khan to lay the foundations of a new city. Shahjahanpur was established in 1647. It became a strong Afghan township where 9,000 Afghans settled, migrating from Roh, the mountainous area south of Khaibar. The tract of land forming the subah or province of Rohilkhand was formerly called Katehr/Katiher. For more details, see Iqbal Husain, The Rise and Decline of the Ruhela Chieftaincies in 18th Century India, Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1994, chapter 1. \\"Katiher by and large consisted of the two sark¬πrs Badaun and Sambhal. Najmul Ghani says that Katiher consisted of the modern districts of Bareilly, Muradabad and Badaun,\\" p. 4, fn. 25. The city of Bareilly was founded in 1537 by Basdeo, a Katehriya Rajput. The city is mentioned in the histories for the first time by Budayuni, who he writes that Husain Quli Khan was appointed the governor of Bareilly and Sambhal in 1568. The divisions and revenue of the district fixed by Todar Mal were recorded by Abul Fazl in 1596. In 1658, Bareilly was made the headquarters of the province of Budaun. The foundation of the 'modern' City of Bareilly was laid by Mukrand Rai in 1657. The tract of land forming the subah or province of Rohilkhand was formerly called Katehr/Katiher.For more details, see Iqbal Husain, The Rise and Decline of the Ruhela Chieftaincies in 18th Century India, Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1994, chapter 1. \\"Katiher by and large consisted of the two sark¬πrs Badaun and Sambhal. Najmul Ghani says that Katiher consisted of the modern districts of Bareilly, Muradabad and Badaun,\\" p. 4, fn. 25. The Mughal policy of encouraging Afghan settlements for keeping the Katehriyas in check worked only as long as the central government was strong. After Aurangzeb's death, the Afghans, having themselves become local potentates, began to seize and occupy neighbouring villages. Regions of Uttar Pradesh including Rohilkhand(with Bareilly as its capital) In 1623 two Afghan brothers of the Barech tribe, Shah Alam and Husain Khan, settled in the region, bringing with them many other Pashtun settlers. The Rohilla Daud Khan was awarded the Katehr region in the then northern India by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir (ruled 1658‚Äì1707) to suppress Rajput uprisings, which had afflicted this region. Originally, some 20,000 soldiers from various Pashtun Tribes (Yusafzais, Ghoris, Lodis, Ghilzai, Barech, Marwat, Durrani, Tanoli, Tarin, Kakar, Khattak, Afridi and Baqarzai) were hired by Mughals to provide soldiers to the Mughal armies and this was appreciated by Aurangzeb Alamgir, an additional force of 25,000 men was given respected positions in Mughal army. However most of them settled in the Katehar region during Nadir Shah's invasion of northern India in 1739 increasing their population up to 100,0000. Due to the large settlement of Rohilla Afghans, the Katehar region gained fame as Rohilkhand. Meanwhile, Ali Muhammad Khan (1737‚Äì1749), grandson of Shah Alam, captured the city of Bareilly and made it his capital, later uniting the Rohillas to form the state of 'Rohilkhand', between 1707 and 1720, making Bareilly his capital. He rapidly rose to power and got confirmed in possession of the lands he had seized. The Emperor made him a Nawab in 1737, and he was recognised as the governor of Rohilkhand in 1740. According to 1901 census of India, the total Pathan population in Bareilly District was 40,779, out of a total population of 1,090,117.Imperial Gazetteer of India by W M Hunter Their principal clans were the Yusafzais, Ghoris, Lodis, Ghilzai, Barech, Marwat, Durrani, Tanoli, Tarin, Kakar, Khattak, Afridi and Baqarzai. Other important cities were Rampur, Shahjahanpur, Badaun, and others.An Eighteenth Century History of North India: An Account Of The Rise And Fall Of The Rohilla Chiefs In Janbhasha By Rustam Ali Bijnori by Iqtidar Husain Siddiqui Manohar Publications Hafiz Rahmat Khan, standing right to Ahmad Shah Durrani, who is shown on a brown horse.(during The 'Third battle of Panipat') 14 January 1761 Ali Muhammad was succeeded by Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech (1749‚Äì1774), whom he appointed as the regent of Rohilkhand on his deathbed.Genealogy of Rampur princely state, Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech extended the power of Rohilkhand from Almora in the North to Etawah in the South-West. Under Rahmat Ali Khan, Rohillas' power continued to rise, though the area was torn by strife amongst the rival chieftains and continuous struggles with the neighbouring powers, particularly the Nawab Vazirs of Awadh,The Nawab Vazirs of Awadh who clashed with the Rohillas were: Saadat Khan Burhan-ul Mulk (1720‚Äì39), Safdar Jung (1739‚Äì56), Shuja-ud Daulah (1756‚Äì75). The combined forces of Shuja-ud Daulah and the British defeated Hafiz Rahmat Khan in 1774. the Bangash NawabsFarrukhabad was the seat of the Bangash Nawabs. Muhammad Khan Bangash was the founder of the settlement. The jagir was conferred upon him by Farrukhsiyar (1713‚Äì19)in 1713 as reward for services rendered by him in the war of succession. and the Marathas.Nawab Safdar Jung of Awadh enlisted the help of the Marathas against the Bangash Nawabs. The Bangash Nawabs sought help from the Rohillasl. The latter were defeated in 1750. The Marathas again invaded Rohilla territory this time attacking Bijnor in 1759. The term Rohilla is derived from the Pashtu Roh, meaning mountain, and literally means a mountain air, and was used by the Baluch and Jats of the Derajat region to refer to the Pashtun mountains tribes of Loralai, Zhob and Waziristan regions. The Rohillas and are men of a taller stature and a fairer complexion than the general inhabitants of the district. The Muslims in the area are chiefly the descendants of Yousafzai Afghans tribe of Pashtuns, called the Rohilla Pathans of the Mandanh sub-section, (but other Pashtuns also became part of the community), who settled in the country about the year 1720. Rohilla's Sardar like Daud Khan, Ali Muhammad Khan, and the legendary Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech were from the renowned Afghan tribe the Barech, who were originally from the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. In Uttar Pradesh, it was used for all Pashtuns, except for the Shia Bangashes who settled in the Rohilkhand region, or men serving under Rohilla chiefs. Rohillas were distinguished by their separate language and culture. They spoke Pashto among each other but gradually lost their language over time and now converse in Urdu. Bishop Heber described them as follows ‚Äì \\"The country is burdened with a crowd of lazy, profligate, self-called sawars (cavaliers), who, though many of them are not worth a rupee, conceive it derogatory to their gentility and Pathan blood to apply themselves to any honest industry, and obtain for the most part a precarious livelihood by sponging on the industrious tradesmen and farmers, on whom they levy a sort of blackmail, or as hangers-on to the wealthy and noble families yet remaining in the province. These men have no visible means of maintenance, and no visible occupation except that of lounging up and down with their swords and shields, like the ancient Highlanders, whom in many respects they much resemble.\\" Rohilkhand (under Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech) was on the winning side at the Third Battle of Panipat of 1761 and successfully blocked the expansion of the Maratha Empire into north India. In 1772 Rohilkhand was invaded by the Marathas; however the Nawabs of Awadh came to the aid of the Rohillas in repulsing the invasion. After the war Nawab Shuja- ud-Daula demanded payment for their help from the Rohilla chief, Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech. When the demand was refused the Nawab joined with the British under Governor Warren Hastings and his Commander-in-Chief, Alexander Champion, to invade Rohilkhand. The combined forces of Shuja-ud Daulah, the Nawab of Awadh and the Company's forces led by Colonel Champion defeated Hafiz Rahmat Ali Khan in 1774. Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech was killed in the ensuing battle at Miranpur Katra in 1774. His death finally closing the chapter of Rohilla rule. Rohilkhand was handed over to the Nawab Vazir of Awadh. From 1774 to 1800, the province was ruled by the Nawabs of Awadh. By 1801, the subsidies due under the various treaties for support of a British force had fallen into hopeless arrears. To defray the debt, Nawab Saadat Ali Khan surrendered Rohilkhand to the East India Company by the treaty of 10 November 1801. Hafiz British Library. During this period too, Bareilly retained its status as a mint. Emperor Akbar and his descendants minted gold and silver coins at mints in Bareilly. The Afghan conqueror Ahmed Shah Durani too minted gold and silver coins at the Bareilly mint. During the time of Shah Alam II, Bareilly was the headquarters of Rohilla Sardar Hafiz Rehmat Khan and many more coins were issued. After that, the city was in possession of Awadh Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah. The coins that he issued had Bareilly, Bareilly Aasfabad, and Bareilly kite and fish as identification marks. After that, the minting of coins passed on to the East India Company. The Rohillas, after fifty years' precarious independence, were subjugated in 1774 by the confederacy of British troops with the Nawab of Oudh's army, which formed a charge against Warren Hastings. Their territory was in that year annexed to Oudh. In 1801 the Nawab of Oudh ceded it to the Company in commutation of the subsidy money. =Modern period= After the Rohillas, the change of the power structure did little to soothe the troubled strife torn area; rather the change had the effect to aggravate a precarious state of affairs. There was a general spirit of discontent throughout the district. In 1812, an inordinate enhancement in the revenue demandSee Conybeare, op. cit. p. 677. and then in 1814 the imposition of a new house tax caused a lot of resentment against the British. \\"Business stood still, shops were shut and multitudes assembled near the courthouse to petition for the abolition of the tax.\\" The Magistrate, Dembleton, already an unpopular man made things worse by ordering the assessment to be made by a Kotwal. In the skirmish that took place between the rebel masses and the sepoys under Captain Cunningham, three or four hundred people died. In 1818, Glyn was posted as Acting Judge, and the Magistrate of Bareilly, and the Joint Magistrate of Bulundshahr. In a research ordered by Glyn asking Ghulam Yahya to write an account about 'craftsmen, the names of tools of manufacture and production and their dress and manners', eleven trades found out to be most popular means of livelihood in and around Bareilly in the 1820s were glass manufacture, manufacture of glass bangles, manufacture of lac bangles, crimping, gram parching, wire drawing, charpoy weaving, manufacture of gold and silver thread, keeping a grocer's shop, making jewellery and selling kab¬πbs. A 1912 map of 'Northern India The Revolt of 1857‚Äì59' showing the centres of rebellion including the principal ones: Meerut, Delhi, Bareilly, (Kanpur), Lucknow, Jhansi, and Gwalior Bareilly (Rohilkhand) was a major centre during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (also known as India's First War of Independence). It began as a mutiny of native soldiers (sepoys) employed by the British East India Company's army, against perceived race based injustices and inequities, on 10 May 1857, in the town of Meerut, and soon erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions which were mainly centred on north central India along the several major river valleys draining the south face of the Himalayas [See red annotated locations on Map at right] but with local episodes extending both northwest to Peshawar on the north-west frontier with Afghanistan and southeast beyond Delhi. There was a widespread popular revolt in many areas such as Awadh, Bundelkhand and Rohilkhand. The rebellion was therefore more than just a military rebellion, and it spanned more than one region. The communal hatred led to ugly communal riots in many parts of U.P. The green flag was hoisted and Muslims in Bareilly, Bijnor, Moradabad and other places the Muslims shouted for the revival of Muslim kingdom.R. C. Majumdar: Sepoy Mutiny and Revolt of 1857 (page 2303-31) The main conflict occurred largely in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, with the major hostilities confined to present-day Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, northern Madhya Pradesh, and the Delhi region. Quote: \\"The 1857 rebellion was by and large confined to northern Indian Gangetic Plain and central India.\\", , and The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British East Indian Company power in that region, Quote: \\"What distinguished the events of 1857 was their scale and the fact that for a short time they posed a military threat to British dominance in the Ganges Plain.\\" and it was contained only with the fall of Gwalior on 20 June 1858. Some regard the rebellion as the first of several movements over ninety years to achieve independence, which was finally achieved in 1947. During the Mutiny of 1857 the Rohillas took a very active part against the English, but since then they had been disarmed. During the First War of Indian Independence in 1857, Khan Bhadur Khan issued silver coins from Bareilly as an independent ruler. These coins are a novelty as far as the numismatist is concerned. The population in 1901 was 1,090,117. Bareilly, also, was the headquarters of a brigade in the 7th division of the eastern army corps in British period. Geography Bareilly is located at 28¬∞10‚Ä≤N, 78¬∞23‚Ä≤E, and lies in northern India. It borders Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur on East and Rampur on west, Udham Singh Nagar (Uttarakhand) in North and Badaun in South. It is a level terrain, watered by many streams, the general slope being towards the south. The soil is fertile and highly cultivated, groves of noble trees abound, and the villages have a neat, prosperous look. A tract of forest jungle called the tarai stretches along the extreme north of the district and teems with large game such as tigers, bears, deer and wild pigs. The river Sarda or Gogra forms the eastern boundary of the district and is the principal stream. Next in importance is the Ramganga, which receives as its tributaries most of the hill torrents of the Kumaon mountains. The Deoha is another great drainage artery and receives many minor streams. The Gomati or Gumti also passes through the district. Demographics According to the 2011 census Bareilly district has a population of 4,448,359, roughly equal to the nation of Croatia or the US state of Louisiana. This gives it a ranking of 39th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001‚Äì2011 was 23.4%. Bareilly has a sex ratio of 883 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 60.52%. According to the 2005 census report of the Government of India, the total population of Bareilly City Region (Bareilly Municipal Corporation and Bareilly Cantt.) is 875,165 having distribution as 53% males and 47% females nearly. The area under the city region is 123.46 km¬≤. The density of the population is among the highest in the country, almost 5000 per km2.

Bijnor city is the district headquarters. The government of Uttar Pradesh seeks it to be included in National Capital Region (NCR) due to its close proximity to NCT of Delhi. History =Medieval history= In 1399, the district was ravaged by Timur. Later, during the time of Akbar, Bijnor was part of his Mughal Empire. In the early 18th century, the Rohilla Pashtuns established their independence in the area called by the Rohilkhand. Around 1748, the Rohilla chief Ali Mohammed Khan made his first annexations in Bijnor, the rest of which soon fell under the Rohilla domination. The northern districts were granted by Ali Mohammed Khan to Khurshid Ahmed Baig, who gradually extended his influence west of the Ganges and at Delhi, receiving the title of Najib-ud-daula with the position of the paymaster of the Mughal forces. Marathas invaded Bijnor who was also instigated by enemies of Rohillas, leading to several battles. Rohilla chief, Najib, who sided with Ahmad Shah Abdali in Panipat, was made vizier of the empire. =Colonial era= In 1772 the Nawab of Oudh made a treaty with the Rohillas, to expel the Marathas in return for a money payment. Nawab of Oudh carried out his part of the bargain, but the Rohilla chieftains refused to pay. In 1774 the Nawab concluded with the East India Company government of Calcutta a treaty of alliance, and he then called upon the British, in accordance with its terms, to supply a brigade to assist him in enforcing his claims against the Rohillas. This was done; in the Rohilla War, the Rohillas were driven beyond the Ganges to the east, and Bijnor was incorporated in the territories of the nawab, who in the same year (1774) ceded it to the British East India Company. During the rebellion of 1857 Bijnor was occupied by the nawab of Najibabad, a grandson of Zabita Khan, on 1 June. In spite of fighting between the Hindus and the Muslim Pashtuns, the Nawab succeeded in maintaining his position until 21 April 1858, when he was defeated by the British at Nagina. Geography  Bijnor, or more correctly Bijnaur, occupies the north-west corner of the Moradabad Division (historically, Rohilkhand or Bareilly region). The western boundary is formed throughout by the deep stream of the river Ganges, beyond which lie the four districts of Dehradun, Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, and Meerut. To the north and north-east in the hill country of Garhwal, the dividing line being the submontane road, which runs from Haridwar along the foot of the Himalayas to Ramanagar, Haldwani, and Tanakpur. This road, popularly known as the Kandi Saradk, belongs throughout its length to Garhwal, the transfer having taken place a few years since. On the east the Phika river for the greater part of its course constitutes the boundary, separating this district from Nainital and Moradabad, as far as its junction with the Ramganga; and to the south lie the Thakurdwara Tehsil of Moradabad. Amroha and Hasanpur tahsils of Amroha District. The boundary being conventional and undetermined by natural features. The extreme parallels of north latitude are 29¬∞ 2' and 29¬∞ 58' and of east longitude 78¬∞ 0' and 78¬∞ 57' from Lalitpur, the most northerly point, to koti Rao in the furthest eastern corner the distance in 56 miles (90 km); and from Koti Rao to Kamharia in the south-westerly angle 57 miles (92 km); and from Kamharia to Lalitpur 62 miles (100 km). The total area of the district is liable to change slightly from time to time by reason of the erratic action of the Ganges and Ramganga: In 1906 it amounted to 1,145,272 acres (1789.5 square miles, 4634.75 km¬≤) the average for the last five years being 1,147,967 acres (4,645.66 km¬≤). There remains the low fringe of Khadir along the Ganges to the west. This generally resembles the lowlands that skirt the rivers of the interior, the low flats which adjoin the stream itself being purely alluvial in character, while above them rises a terrace of higher ground extending inland as far as the chain of stagnant morasses lying immediately under the bangar cliff. Demographics According to the 2011 census Bijnor district has a population of 3,682,713, roughly equal to the nation of Liberia or the US state of Oklahoma. This gives it a ranking of 74th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 17.64%. Bijnor has a sex ratio of 913 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 70.43%. =Religion= Majority of the people of the district follow Hinduism followed closely by adherents of Islam. Sikhism is followed by a little more than one percent of the population. Jainism, Christianity and Buddhism have small number of adherents. =Languages= Hindi and Urdu are the official languages.

History Eastleigh Works Management Building =LSWR= The London and South Western Railway (LSWR) opened a carriage and wagon works at Eastleigh in 1891. In 1903, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, Dugald Drummond, oversaw the construction of a large motive power depot in the town; replacing the existing maintenance and repair shops at Northam, Southampton.\\"On shed\\" Rail Express issue 259 December 2017 page 22 In January 1910, locomotive building was likewise transferred to the new workshops at Eastleigh from Nine Elms in London. Among the locomotives produced by the LSWR under Drummond at Eastleigh, were the S14 0-4-0 and M7 0-4-4 tank engines, the P14 and T14 4-6-0, and D15 4-4-0, classes. Following the appointment of Robert Urie as Chief Mechanical Engineer in 1912, the works were responsible for the construction of the H15, S15, and N15 (King Arthur) 4-6-0 classes, and the G16 4-8-0, and H16 4-6-0 tank engines. =Southern Railway= The old canteen shown from inside the works November 2014 Following the merger of the LSWR and other railways in southern England to form the Southern Railway, as part of the Railways Act grouping of 1923, Eastleigh was to become the principal works for the new railway. The new Chief Mechanical Engineer, Richard Maunsell re- organised the works and directed the design and construction of various new classes. Like most of the railway works, Eastleigh was heavily involved in the war effort, producing, in 1938, sets of parts to convert Blenheim bombers so that they could be used as fighters. The works was also part of a joint venture with other workshops, railway and private, to produce Horsa gliders for the D-Day airborne assault. With Lancing works, it turned out 200 tail units. It also produced 1,500 anti-tank gun barrels and, with Brighton railway works, 240 multiple rocket launchers, plus landing craft, fuel tenders and harbour launches. Under the Southern Railway, the works were responsible for building the Maunsell SR Lord Nelson Class 4-6-0, the Schools 4-4-0, U1 2-6-0, W class 2-6-4 tanks, and Q class 0-6-0 locomotives. Under the regime of Oliver Bulleid, after 1937, Eastleigh works constructed all thirty of the SR Merchant Navy Class and six of the West Country 4-6-2. During the Second World War, Eastleigh works built 23 examples of the London Midland and Scottish Railway designed 8F 2-8-0s. By the end of 1947, the works had built 304 locomotives with a further 16 before steam locomotive building ceased in 1950.Larkin (2008), p.19 In 1945, the carriage works began constructing all-steel carriages, both electric and steam hauled. It pioneered the use of plastics and glass fibre reinforced resin for doors, seating and roof sections. B4 0-4-0T 30102 at Eastleigh 1964 =British Rail= In 1950, following the nationalisation of the Southern Railway to form the Southern Region of British Railways new steam locomotive building ceased at Eastleigh. However the works were kept fully occupied between 1956 and 1961 in rebuilding over 90 of the Bulleid 4-6-2 classes. Thereafter the works gradually changed over to steam and diesel repairs. In 1962, the works was again reorganised with the carriage works site being sold, and carriage and electric multiple unit repairs transferred to the main locomotive works. In 1962, Eastleigh Works built the first six electro-diesel locomotives of British Rail Class 73 but the remainder of the class were built at the Vulcan Foundry. =Post privatisation= A circular view from a central part of the sheds in November 2014.

Based on the Furlings characters created by Rae Lambert, the film was directed by Charles Grosvenor and produced by David Kirschner, and stars the voices of Michael Crawford, Ellen Blain, Benji Gregory, Paige Gosney, Elisabeth Moss, and Ben Vereen. The film is about three \\"Furlings\\" ‚Äì the story's term for animal children ‚Äì who go on an expedition to cure a friend that has been poisoned by chemical fumes. The film's environmental theme divided critics at the time of its release, along with the animation and story. The film was a box office bomb, grossing US$6.6 million against a budget of $13 million. Plot In the forest of Dapplewood, four \\"Furlings\\" ‚Äì Abigail, a woodmouse; Edgar, a mole; Russell, a hedgehog, and Michelle, a badger ‚Äì live alongside their teacher and Michelle's uncle, Cornelius. One day, the Furlings go on a trip through the forest with Cornelius, where they see a road for the first time. Russell is almost run over by a Range Rover and the driver throws away a glass bottle that shatters in the middle of the road. Afterward, they go back to the forest to find that it has been destroyed by poison gas from an overturned tanker truck that blew a tire from the broken glass bottle. Michelle panics and runs to her home to find her parents, breathing in the gas and becoming severely ill. Abigail risks her own life and saves a comatose Michelle, but can do nothing for Michelle's parents. The Furlings go to Cornelius' house nearby for shelter after they find their homes deserted, believing everyone else to have succumbed to the gas. Cornelius tells the Furlings of his past encounter with humans that claimed the lives of his parents, hence why he is fearful of all human beings. He says he needs two herbs to make a potion that will save Michelle's life: lungwort and eyebright. With limited time, the Furlings head off for their journey the next day. After facing numerous dangers, including a hungry barn owl, receiving aid from a flock of religious wrens led by preacher Phineas, and encountering intimidating construction vehicles that the wrens call \\"Yellow Dragons\\", the Furlings make it to the meadow with the herbs they need. There, they meet the bully squirrel Waggs, and Willy, a tough but sensible mouse who grows a liking for Abigail. After getting the eyebright, they discover that the lungwort is on a giant cliff making it inaccessible by foot. Russell suggests they use Cornelius' airship, the Flapper-Wing-a-Ma- Thing, to get to the lungwort. The Furlings manage to get the lungwort after a dangerous flight up the cliff, then steer their airship back for Dapplewood. They crash-land back in the forest after a storm, and bring the herbs to Michelle and Cornelius. A group of humans appear and the animals, thinking the humans mean them harm, escape through the backdoor of Cornelius' house. Edgar gets separated from the group and gets caught in an old trap. When one of the workers finds him, the animals are surprised when he frees Edgar and destroys the trap, revealing that the men are cleaning up the gas. The group, especially Cornelius, realize that there are good humans in the world. Michelle is given the herbs. The next day, she appears unresponsive, but a single tear from Cornelius awakens her from her coma. Cornelius sees the Flapper-Wing-a-Ma-Thing and becomes amazed by how the Furlings have grown up. The Furlings' families and many of the other inhabitants arrive as well, except for Michelle's parents; Cornelius promises to do his best on taking care of her. The Furlings happily reunite with their families, who are relieved to see that their children are alright. Michelle asks Cornelius if anything will ever be the same again. Cornelius looks at the dead trees in the forest and says to her that if everyone works as hard to save Dapplewood as the Furlings did to save Michelle, it will be.

It is situated to the north of the city centre, adjacent to the border with Staffordshire, within the Bushbury North ward of Wolverhampton City Council. It is the most northerly part of the city alongside Pendeford, adjacent to the M54 motorway. Name and origins The place name 'Fordhouses' refers to the houses situated alongside the Wolverhampton to Stafford road next to where the road crosses the Wobaston Brook. In 14th century subsidy rolls, folk living here were described as being 'atte forde'.Notes on Staffordshire Place Names By W H Duignan This is the earliest known reference to people living in this area, though the nearby Wobaston place name is said by toponymists'The Place- Names of Staffordshire', by David Horovitz to derive from 'Wibaldes tun' - likely the early English / Anglo-Saxon 'Wigbeald', with 'tun' meaning homestead or farmstead - so the name would literally mean the farmstead of Wigbeald. Modern times Fordhouses was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi The tornado later moved out over Wolverhampton city centre, causing further damage. Today, Fordhouses stretches over a large area, as far south as Oxley, as far west as Pendeford, as far north as junction 2 of the M54 at Coven Heath and as far east as Bushbury. It encompasses several smaller areas, such as Wobaston, Snapes Green, the Harrowby estate & Lesscroft. The area is a mix of housing and industrial, with many rows of industrial units in the north-east along the Wobaston and Stafford Roads, such as HS Marston Aerospace & Spectre UK Ltd, with housing taking up much of the rest of the area. Shops & amenities Shops at Vine Island, Wobaston There are two focal points in the central Fordhouses area - both straddling the Stafford Road. The first being the shops at Vine Island in Wobaston. Here there is a branch of the Co-Operative Food store, Fordhouses Post Office, Pete's Plaice Fish & Chip shop, Sandwich Box, TJ's barbers, the Poonian pharmacy, a Lifestyle Express off licence, and a branch of Jimmy Trims. This shopping area is now served by its own road and car parks running counter to the traffic, accessed via the Wobaston Road. The other local shops are slightly further north on a slip road running off the southbound arm of the Stafford Road. These include a Perfect Pizza, the Fordhouses Chippy, Kitchen Factory, Wine Cellar, News Xpress newsagents, Sandwich King, K3 Hair salon and The Olive Branch, a gift shop. On the opposite side of the Stafford Road is a BP petrol station. There was previously a petrol station on the same side as the shops, but this was recently demolished to make way for new housing. On Harrowby Road there is a small row of shops including Pauls, ', Yummy Yummy Rice House Chinese take-away and a barbers called \\"Turkish Barber\\" Public houses There are two pubs in and around the central Fordhouses area today. The Moreton Armshttp://www.moretonarmspub.co.uk/ is located on Springfield Lane, which is a Marston's plc pub that specialises in food and good ale. The other is Moseley Park, a Table Table pub which also specialises in food and good ale. Until c.2003, The Vine (Grapevine) and annexed The Old Vine pubs stood on Vine Island (lending its name to the island). These have been pulled down and modern apartments now stand in its place, with a vine shaped fence paying homage to the old pub. On the Harrowby estate is a pub called The Harrowby, which stands on the corner of Patshull Avenue and Harrowby Road. There is also a members only social club on Pendeford / Fordhouses border, which is part of the Fordhouses Cricket Club (formerly Dowtys). People, groups & organisations The mixed voice choir group, The Marston Singers, are a Fordhouses-based choir group. They formed in 1961 when Keith Lloyd along with other employees from engineering company Marston Excelsior Limited set up a small choir. Though this disbanded in 1964, the choir were back in 1970 & continue to this day.http://www.myspace.com/marston_singers Fordhouses also has an Air Training Corps squadron based on Bee Lane. Sport Fordhouses is home to Fordhouses Cricket Club,http://fordhouses.play-cricket.com/ located on the Wobaston Road at the border with Pendeford. Until 2010 a second cricket club sat within the estate, giving its name to the road Cricket Meadow. The land, including that of a small farm which sat alongside, has since been developed as a housing estate called Boundary Park. The farm house itself has been kept as a part of the housing estate. Several football teams play at the nearby Goodrich Sports Ground, located within Goodrich's works on the Stafford Road. These include Goodrich F.C. and their youth team.

He is the longest serving-governor of Wyoming with three full terms and since a two term limit for governors was approved by a ballot initiative in 1992 has remained as such. Early life The Herschler family ranch in 1912 Edgar Jacob Herschler was born in Kemmerer, Wyoming on October 27, 1918 to Edgar Fuller Herschler and Charlotte Jenkins. During his childhood, he was initially taught at his family's ranch before later attended high school in Kemmerer. In 1941, he graduated from the University of Colorado with a Bachelor of Arts in Pre-Law. In 1949, he earned his LL.B from the University of Wyoming. Herschler served in the Pacific Theater during World War II. He served as Kemmerer's city attorney and then as Lincoln County attorney from 1951 to 1958 and from 1961 to 1963. Career =Legislature= On June 15, 1960 he filed to run for the Democratic nomination for one of Lincoln County's three seats in the Wyoming House of Representatives and won in the general election. Upon taking office he introduced a bill that would repeal Wyoming's inheritance tax. However, after the initial forty day session of the house he resigned on March 10, 1961 to become Lincoln County's attorney again, but filed to run for the house again in 1962 and won a seat in the general election placing second. In the 1964 elections the Democrats took control of the state house and in the 1965 legislative session Herschler was selected as House Majority Whip and made chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. In 1967 he cosponsored the first air pollution control bill in Wyoming and on September 13, 1968 he was elected as president of the Wyoming State Bar Association. He was considered a possible candidate for governor in the 1970 election, but stated on December 10, 1969 that he was not interested in running for governor. On April 27, 1970 he announced that he would run for the Democratic nomination for Wyoming's at-large congressional district, but was defeated by former Representative Teno Roncalio who went on to win in the general election. On October 27 he endorsed Roncalio following his defeat in the August primary. In 1971 he stated that he was contact by Governor Stanley K. Hathaway as being a possible appointment to the Wyoming Supreme Court, but was not selected. =Governor= On May 23, 1974 he announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for governor and defeated former state senator Dick Jones in the general election. He was critical of President Jimmy Carter for his agricultural stances and water projects and when Carter visited Grand Teton National Park from August 24 to September 1, 1978 he had Herschler notified that he was not invited. In 1978 he narrowly won reelection by 2,377 votes, but easily won reelection to a third term in 1982 becoming Wyoming's only governor to serve more than two terms. In 1986 he announced that he would not seek reelection to a fourth term. Governor Herschler being presented a hat and saber, June 1977 In September 1981 Cody, Wyoming hosted the Western Governors Association's annual conference of that year and Herschler was selected as president of the Western Conference to serve a one year term from 1981 to 1982. In 1985, he commuted the sentences and ordered the releases of Deborah and Richard Janhke, Jr., who were both convicted in 1983 of manslaughter in the 1982 death of their abusive father, Richard Jahnke, Sr., in Cheyenne and who were the subjects of the television film Right to Kill? In September 1985 he had to file for bankruptcy due to the failure of his 18,500 acre Yellowstone Ranch with almost $6 million in debt. During his tenure he vetoed more bills than any other governor in Wyoming's history, but none of his vetoes were ever overridden despite the Republicans holding supermajorities in both chambers during most of his tenure. Some of his vetoes were unpopular such as when in 1984 he vetoed a homeowners tax credit program stating that it would subsidize homeowners who did not need it which resulted in the Democrats losing seven seats in the House of Representatives. Later life After leaving office he returned to practicing law in Cheyenne and in 1988, multiple people attempted to convince him to run in the Senate election against Malcolm Wallop, but he chose not to. In February 1988, he endorsed and campaigned for Senator Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination and on March 5 Wyoming became the first of seven contests that Gore won in the presidential primaries. His successor as governor, Mike Sullivan, supported cigarette tax hikes and smoking bans and was added to Phillip Morris' list of smokers' enemies and in May 1988 Herschler criticized him for it and suggested that municipalities that ban smoking should not be given money from cigarette tax revenues. In early December 1989, he was hospitalized for cancer treatment and released on December 15, but was re-hospitalized in January 1990. On February 5, 1990 he died in Cheyenne after suffering from cancer at age 71.

Lewis Blaine Hershey (September 12, 1893 ‚Äì May 20, 1977) was a United States Army general who served as the second Director of the Selective Service System, the means by which the United States administers its military conscription. Early life He was born in Steuben County, Indiana. He attended the local public schools and graduated from Tri-State College (now Trine University) in 1914 receiving a degree in education. He taught at local elementary schools and served as a school principal in Indiana. He married Ellen Dygert (1892‚Äì1977) and had four children: Kathryn, Gilbert, George, and Ellen. Military Hershey enlisted in the Indiana National Guard in 1911. Hershey received a direct commission as a second lieutenant in 1913. In 1916, his guard unit was called to active duty on the Mexican border. The unit was relieved in December 1916. His unit was again called to federal service during World War I and sent to France with the American Expeditionary Force. Hershey raised a Master Mason in Northeastern Lodge 210, Fremont, Indiana, in 1916. After the war, Hershey remained in the National Guard until he received a regular commission as a captain in the Regular Army in 1920. He attended the Command and General Staff College and the Army War College. Hershey taught military science at the Ohio State University and then served in the general staff as G-4 at the Department of Hawaii. =Career= In 1936, he was assigned to the General Staff in Washington, DC. In October 1940, President Franklin Roosevelt promoted him to brigadier general and named him executive officer of the Selective Service System. On July 31, 1941, President Roosevelt named Hershey director of the Selective Service. In 1942, Hershey was promoted to major general. In 1943, he received an honorary degree in Doctor of Laws from Oglethorpe University. While officially retiring on December 31, 1946, he was retained on active duty starting the next day. He was the longest-serving director in the history of the Selective Service System, and held the position until February 15, 1970, spanning World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. General Hershey was one of only six generals in the history of the United States Army to have served as a general during three major conflicts. The other five were Brevet Lieutenant General Winfield Scott (War of 1812, Mexican War and Civil War), General of the Army Douglas MacArthur (World War I, World War II and Korea), Lieutenant General Milton Reckord (World War II, Korea, Vietnam), Major General Leo Boyle (World War II, Korea, Vietnam), and General Hugh Shelton (Panama, Gulf War, War on Terror). (Generals Reckord and Boyle were both long serving state adjutants general in the National Guard.) Hershey was promoted to lieutenant general in 1956 and to four-star general on December 23, 1969. On October 24, 1967, in response to increasing demonstrations against military recruiting on college campuses, Hershey issued Local Board Memorandum No. 85, since known as the Hershey Directive, which recommended that when a draft card was abandoned or mutilated that registrant should be declared \\"a delinquent for failure to have the card in his possession\\" and then be reclassified as available for service. Two days later, he sent a letter to local boards suggesting that violators of any portion of the Selective Service Act or Regulations be treated as delinquent. Notably, he said that such violations included \\"illegal activity which interferes with recruiting,\\" which was assumed to mean demonstrating against military recruiters. Unlike the Memorandum, the letter was unofficial. This order outraged students, many of whom were not subject to being drafted due to education deferments, and campus demonstrations against the war (and Hershey's order) increased. Various Supreme Court cases voided the Memorandum, and after one of them Hershey withdrew it with Memorandum No. 101, on January 21, 1970. The most explicit overruling of the Memorandum and Letter came in a decision from the United States Court of Appeals Third Circuit in Bucher v. Selective Service Systemhttp://openjurist.org/421/f2d/24/bucher-v-selective-service- system-local-boards-nos-etc on January 2, 1970, which ruled that there is \\"no statutory authorization for such reclassification,\\" but did not rule on First Amendment issues: > Since we have reached the conclusion that the delinquency reclassifications > here are invalid for the separate and independent reasons that (1) they > violate the constitutional procedural due process guarantees of the Fifth > and Sixth Amendments, and (2) they lack statutory authorization, we find it > unnecessary to advert to the plaintiffs' contention that the > reclassifications violate their First Amendment rights. (Many online articles erroneously refer to Bucher v. Selective Service System as a Supreme Court decision.) The controversy over the Hershey Directive led to calls for his retirement. On February 15, 1970 President Richard Nixon appointed Hershey as Presidential Advisor for Manpower Mobilization and Hershey vacated the office of Director of the Selective Service. Retirement As required by law, Hershey was involuntarily retired from the Army on April 10, 1973, at the age of 79, as a four-star general.

The men's senior team play in National League 2 North - at the fourth level of the English rugby union system - following their promotion from North Premier as champions at the end of the 2017-18 season. History The club was founded on 28 September 1869 at a meeting held at the Bull Hotel, Preston, making it one of the oldest 'northern' rugby union teams. Grasshoppers' players who have progressed to bigger stages include A.N. Hornby, the first man to captain both the English national rugby and cricket sides, Dick Greenwood and his son Will Greenwood, later to play outside centre for Leicester Tigers, Harlequins and England, second row star Steve Borthwick, captaining Bath and playing a key role in the England international side, Wade Dooley, who won 55 caps in the second row for England, and Paul Grayson, who went on to play a number of games at fly half for England. Other past players gaining England caps include Don Rutherford and Iain Balshaw. Wigan Athletic F.C. striker James Vaughan also played rugby union for the side, before switching to football. When the national league structure was introduced in the mid nineties, Hoppers remained in National League 3 (North) until their promotion in 1998‚Äì99 season. This was achieved with the help of Australian Michael Lough and winger Ian Bruce who, between them, scored over 50 tries. In 2013 Preston Grasshoppers 2nd team won the Preston Sports Awards Team Performance of the Year. At the end of the 2015‚Äì16 Season Preston Grasshoppers accepted an offer from the RFU to replace the grass surface at Lightfoot Green Lane with an artificial 3G pitch. The terms of the agreement mean that the RFU have exclusive use of the pitch for the next 30 years. In 2017/18 the club made an immediate return to National 2 North by winning the Northern Premier League at the first attempt. Under Head Coach Paul Arnold the side were the stand out side in the division with Number 8 Matthew Lamprey scoring 32 league tries during the campaign to set a new club record for tries in a league season, beating the previous best of 27 set by Michael Lough in the 1998/99 National 2 North Championship winning season.

It is north-east of Wolverhampton city centre, within the Bushbury South and Low Hill ward.  Place name & history  The place name, Low Hill comes from Old English 'hl√¶w', meaning tumulus or mound - often those used for burial, with hill added at a later date. The antiquary, John Huntbach, noted that the Battle of Tettenhall / Wednesfield was likely fought in the vicinity of Low Hill, quoting the names of several lows in the vicinity - the North Lowe, the South Lowe, Horslowe (in the area of Horseley Fields - where the name comes from), Little Lowe, Tromelow (the more recent local name 'Rumbelows' comes from this), and so on.https://www.gutenberg.org/files/31675/31675.txt The Annals Of Willenhall, by Frederick William Hackwood The land was purchased by Wolverhampton council for housing development in 1924 to enable the construction of new homes to let to families being rehoused from town centre slums. More than 2,000 houses were built at Low Hill between 1925 and 1929, making it one of the largest housing estates in the country at the time, and by far the largest in Wolverhampton. Prior to the 1920s, the area was very rural, with scattered farms and houses such as Showell Farm, Low Hill House, Old Fallings Farm and Old Fallings Hall connected by a series of ancient bridleways. When the new estate was built, a completely new road layout was put down with it, obliterating the old route systems and changing the landscape almost completely. The estate was conveniently located for people working in the local manufacturing industry, particularly the Guy Motors bus factory in Park Lane and the Goodyear plant in Stafford Road. As late as 1971, unemployment in Low Hill was a mere 4%, although there was concern among local residents about the deteriorating condition of housing on the estate, largely blamed on the council's alleged failure to maintain the properties to an adequate level. Low Hill was a popular destination for Wolverhampton's Commonwealth immigrant population, with more than 200 such families living there by the 1970s. However, the recession of the mid 1970s saw unemployment on the estate rise, and unemployment rose again in the early 1980s as a result of another recession. The closure of the Guy Motors factory in 1982 was easily the biggest blow to hit the workforce of Low Hill. By this stage, local crime rates were rising and Low Hill was widely regarded as one of the worst districts of Wolverhampton. Further local factory closures in the early 2000s saw unemployment on the estate reach around 15%, at a time when the national unemployment rate was around 5%, one major blow at this time being the downsizing of the Goodyear factory. The recession of 2008 and 2009 saw unemployment rise even higher.  Today  The centre of Low Hill is situated around Showell Circus. The Bushbury Arms public house was built during the 1930s and closed in 2013, but the building was retained and incorporated into a new housing development in 2015. Showell Circus is the first traffic island in the United Kingdom to be awarded Village green status. The western part of Low Hill is currently being redeveloped. In the late 2000s, over 90 houses around Fifth Avenue were demolished and a police base, NHS walk-in centre and multi-sport ball court were built in their place along with a new upmarket housing development, which extends also into ground vacant from the demolition of a disused factory. Low Hill is also within walking distance of the Wolverhampton Science Park, created in the late 1990s on the site of Wolverhampton Gas Works and Gorsebrook House. In 2010, 50 new affordable 'eco' homes were built at Showell Park.http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/Work- starts-on-fifty-new-eco-friendly-homes Low Hill is well known locally for the extravagant Christmas decorations, which can be seen on many houses in the area in the run up to Christmas every year.http://hohoho.org.uk/storiesmain.php?StoryID=16 Low Hill is unfortunately often in the news for many of the wrong reasons, such as crime and youth gangs. It also has a high level of unemployment.https://www.expressandstar.com/latest/2009/05/29/yobs-in-court- for-flouting-asbos/https://www.expressandstar.com/latest/2009/03/04/witness- plea-to-shooting/https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/02/17/robber-with- axe-gets-jail-warning/ In 2006 there was a Local Neighbourhood Partnership (LNP) covering Low Hill and neighbouring estates like the Scotlands to tackle the area's many problems and bring the community together more.

History =Hyde Park 1998= The Hyde Park show was first created as a one-off performance of Flatley's previous show, \\"Lord of the Dance\\". It premiered on 25 July 1998, playing to approximately 25,000 people at Rotten Row (known as \\"Route of Kings\\"), an open-space arena-like riding track area located in the south side of London's Hyde Park. Although closely resembling its predecessor, this show merged troupes, added new numbers, and featured a multi-level stage for the finale as well as an all-male choir and a live band. Amongst the new numbers is Flatley's solo ‚Äì \\"Feet of Flames\\", which the show is based around. The show introduced some of the key elements that are now featured when Flatley performs. His silver-heeled shoes made by Freed of London were used for the first time in this show. TV screens on both sides of the stage were installed and are now used in all the shows that feature Flatley. Film of the Hyde Park show was later distributed on VHS and DVD. =2000-2001 World/Victory Tour= On 21 September 1999 Michael Flatley announced a \\"Feet of Flames\\" world tour for 2000. This tour began on Wednesday, 1 March 2000, in Germany. The show differed significantly from the original 1998 version. The show had new numbers, new leads, a new story line and a \\"whole new outlook\\" in the words of Flatley. Both the original female leads Bernadette Flynn and Gillian Norris were replaced by Sarah Clark and Leigh Ann McKenna. Daire Nolan was replaced by Stephen Brunning. Both Daire Nolan and Gillian Norris went on to pursue their own careers after the 1998 show. Bernadette Flynn left to dance with Lord of the Dance troupe one until 2001. Some of the characters changed slightly in the show. Lord of the Dance became Firespirit, Saroise became The Swan and Morrighan the Temptress became Cleopatra. The Dark Lord was remained but there are sayings that they still used Don Dorcha as the name. Helen Egan's part as the little spirit became the Court Jester in the World Tour. The Highlight of the 2000 tour was Flatley and the Troupe performing in Budapest to over 100,000 people. The European part of the 2000 World Tour concluded on 29 July 2000 in Stormont Castle, Belfast, Northern Ireland. The 2001 tour, dubbed the \\"USA Victory Tour\\", had a preview show on 6 June 2001 in the Bi-Lo Center, Greenville, South Carolina. The tour officially began on 8 June 2001 in the AmericanAirlines Arena, Miami, Florida. The highlight of the tour was Michael Flatley performing for the first time in Madison Square Garden in New York City on 29 June 2001. The tour ended on 29 July 2001 in Dallas, Texas in the American Airlines Center, the second event to be held at the venue. The last time the show was performed was 29 July 2001. Michael Flatley was said to have retired that night but later in 2005 would come out with a new show, Celtic Tiger. =2008 and 2009 Tour= \\"Feet of Flames\\" returned to the world stage for a brief period with lead dancers Damien O' Kane and Bernadette Flynn taking the lead. This would mark the first time in the show's history that Michael Flatley did not star or dance in it. This show featured dances and costumes from 1998 Hyde Park show. Later in 2009 Flatley returned in the lead role. =2009= In 2009, Michael Flatley reprised his role in the 2009 tour held in the Taipei Arena in Taipei, Taiwan. It was filmed for DVD and later released as noted in his website. It was also released on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk by Playback HD in 2010. The 2009 return of Michael Flatley would later mark his return to his show, Lord of the Dance in 2010. CD, VHS and DVD releases Flatley performing The \\"Feet of Flames\\" show from Hyde Park in 1998 was released on VHS and DVD. A CD of the new music from the Hyde park show was released with the DVD. The Budapest show in 2000 was recorded for DVD release but this did not happen; however, clips of the show were put on Michael Flatley's autobiography/concert DVD Michael Flatley Gold. Included on the DVD are the numbers: *The Court of High Kings *Firedance *Cleopatra's Spell *Thunder and Lightning *Stolen Kiss *The Duel *Victory March/Victory Dance *Feet of Flames solo The Madison Square Garden show on 29 June 2001 in New York City and the American Airlines Center show on 29 July 2001 in Dallas, Texas, were recorded. The American leg of the tour was filmed for an IMAX planned for release in 2002. In addition parts of the footage were going to be used in a film featuring Michael Flatley. The working title for the film was supposedly \\"Dream Dancer\\", a fictional love story. Clips of the rehearsal process for the movie can be found on Michael Flatley Gold. The film was, however, never completed. The original film from the shows in allegedly tied up in ownership dispute between the filming company and Michael Flatley's company Unicorn Entertainment. The 2009 Taiwan tour was filmed for an actual DVD release and later released on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in 2010 The chanting of the monks from the \\"Court of High Kings\\" (Victory Tour) is sampled on the first track of Michael Flatley's flute album \\"On A Different Note\\", which was released in March 2011.

She is from seven years in the future, in the aftermath of her \\"accident\\", so it is a kind of a time slip story, but she has no memories of those seven years.

Retrieved 5 September 2012. Plot summary The book begins with the words \\"There's been an accident! Something's wrong!\\" ‚Äì and something is. There is a ghost. She does not know who she is, or how she died, or quite where she is. All she knows is that there has been a terrible accident. The as-yet unnamed heroine finds herself attracted to a large building, a boys' boarding school, which she finds to be strangely familiar. After a little detective work, the disembodied spirit concludes that she is Sally Melford, one of a quartet of eccentric sisters (Imogen, Cart, Fenella and Sally) who live at the school and are neglected by their overworked parents, both of whom teach at the school. Their father, only known as Himself, is the headmaster, and his wife, Phyllis, is the school nurse. Both of them are constantly busy with school business, and leave their daughters to fend for themselves. As the plot continues, evidence of time- travel begins to emerge. In the present day, the adult, university-age Sally is in a hospital, badly injured after her abusive boyfriend threw her from a speeding car. Some part of her has journeyed back seven years into the past, where, with the help of her sisters and their schoolboy friends, she must undo a rash bargain with the powerful and ancient goddess, Monigan. The Worship of Monigan is a game that the sisters made up, in which an old rag doll supposedly represents the goddess Monigan. Throughout the story, the sisters vary from treat the Worship of Monigan as a game to believing in it quite seriously. Sally also seems to be romantically involved with a student at the school, the enigmatic fifth-former Julian Addiman, who mocks at how the sisters seem to take the Worship of Monigan very seriously. After a deal of detective work, Sally (in her ghostly form) discovers the truth. The young Sally had dedicated herself to Monigan in a midnight ritual, with the help of Julian. Monigan had taken her up on the offer, and had agreed that Sally would be hers in seven years' time. The seven years are now up, and Monigan had attempted to call in the debt, in the form of the boyfriend (now revealed to be the same Julian Addiman) tossing her out of the car. However, Sally survived; with the help of her sisters and her childhood friends, she is determined to cheat Monigan, and take back her life. Characters Selina (Sally) Melford ‚Äì The main protagonist of the book. She is considered by her sisters as being the most sentimental. Her nickname is Semolina. Charlotte (Cart) Melford ‚Äì One of Sally's four sisters. As a teenager, she is fat and unattractive to boys, but in the future-part of the book, she has turned into a thin and beautiful young woman. She is the least emotional, and has little time for sentimentality, but she is often prone to being aggressive, particularly in the mornings. Fenella Melford ‚Äì The youngest Melford sister, Fenella is also the most eccentric. Her preferred mode of dress is a green sack, made by Cart; she has knots tied in her hair, and large buck teeth with a gap between them. She is portrayed as small and gnome like, but, like Cart, in the future-part of the book, she is very beautiful, and is training to become an opera singer. Imogen (Imo) Melford ‚Äì Imogen is the most career- oriented; she is utterly focused on her planned career as a concert pianist. She is also shown as the most attractive (\\"angelic\\") of the sisters, but in the future-part, she has turned into a drab young woman, stuck doing something she does not really want to do. Julian Addiman ‚Äì A fifth-former at the school, who is very good at getting his own way. He is handsome, and uses this to great effect, especially when dealing with Cart and Sally, who are both very attracted to him. However, he is controlling and abusive towards Sally, and ends up throwing her out of a speeding car.

Astron Belt was ported to the MSX home system in 1984 in Japan. Gameplay The player controls a lone spacecraft on a mission to singlehandedly take down the entire enemy armada. Enemy fighters and ships shoot at the player, and there are mines and other objects that must be shot or avoided. The game is divided into waves. At the end of each wave is a command ship that must be destroyed. In later waves the enemy fighters move and shoot more aggressively, and their shots are more accurate. Some waves take place in open space, while others require the player to battle enemies while flying through narrow trenches and tunnels. The player is on a timer at the beginning of the game, with an unlimited number of lives available. The length of the timer can be adjusted by the machine operator, but is normally 60 seconds. After the timer expires, the player is given a limited number of additional lives. When all of those lives are lost, the game ends. The background videos used in the game are a mixture of original artwork and borrowed material. In addition to the scenes created specifically for the game, the designers also incorporated footage from three science fiction movies: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Battle Beyond the Stars, and Message from Space. Technical Astron Belt used one of four laserdisc players, either a Pioneer LD-V1000 or LD-V1001, or a Hitachi VIP-9500SG or VIP-9550. Two different versions of the laser disc itself were also pressed, a single-sided version by Pioneer and a double-sided version by Sega. However, both discs have the same information and may be used in any of the four players. Running on the Sega Laserdisc hardware, the game combines pre-rendered laserdisc footage with a real-time 2D computer graphics plane. The real-time graphics plane was overlaid by imitating a matting technique. As the CRT monitor scans horizontally across the screen, it is fed information from the laserdisc up until the point where it is fed information from the computer graphics system, after which information coming from the laserdisc stops, creating a black mask into which a sprite is inserted. It uses a collision detection system where both the laserdisc and sprite planes can interact with each other. Each frame of the laserdisc footage is coded with a hit detection spot stored in ROM memory. The Zilog Z80 CPU reads the number of the laserdisc frame, and checks the laserdisc hit spots with the shots fired by the player, and if the coordinates correspond, it instructs the laserdisc player to display an explosion sequence. For sections where the player must navigate between walls, the walls in the laserdisc footage are also coded and use collision detection.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Astron Belt on their June 1, 1983 issue as being the most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. Legacy Astron Belt was responsible for starting the interactive movie laserdisc craze when it was shown at the 1982 AMOA show. One of the laserdisc games it inspired was Dragon's Lair. Sega and Bally Midway released a sequel called Starblazer (also known as Galaxy Ranger) in 1984. It had the same controls and very similar gameplay to Astron Belt, and one machine could be converted to the other by simply changing the laserdisc, game ROMs, and sound board. In Japan, Game Machine listed Starblazer on their January 15, 1984 issue as being the third most-successful upright arcade unit of the year.

He was a staunch defender of the rights of the Jews of France.http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1220526714430&pagename;=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull/Cremieux Street: Champion of French Jewry. Biography He was born in N√Æmes to a wealthy Jewish family, which had migrated from the papal enclave of Carpentras to N√Æmes. He married a member of the Silny family in 1824. He and his wife are credited with raising their grand-daughter, author and activist Louise Cruppi. Political career After the revolution of 1830 he came to Paris, formed connections with numerous political personages, even with King Louis Philippe, and became a brilliant defender of Liberal ideas in the law courts and in the press. Examples include his √âloge fun√®bre of the bishop Gr√©goire (1830), his M√©moire for the political rehabilitation of Marshal Ney (1833), and his plea for the accused of April 1835. Elected deputy in 1842, he was one of the leaders in the campaign against the Guizot ministry, and his eloquence contributed greatly to the success of his party. From 1834 until his death, Cr√©mieux served as vice-president of the \\"Consistoire Central des Isra√©lites de France\\" (Central Consistory of the Jews of France), the administrative agency for all French Jews. On 24 February 1848 he was chosen by the Republicans as a member of the provisional government, and as minister of justice he secured the decrees abolishing the death penalty for political offenses, and making the office of judge immovable. That same year he was instrumental in declaring an end to slavery in all French Colonies, for which some have called him the French Abraham Lincoln. When the conflict between the Republicans and Socialists broke out, he resigned office but continued to sit in the constituent assembly. At first he supported Louis Napoleon, but when he discovered the prince's imperial ambitions he broke with him. Arrested and imprisoned on 2 December 1851, he remained in private life until November 1869, when he was elected as a Republican deputy for Paris. On 4 September 1870 he was again chosen as a member of the government of national defense, and resumed his position in the ministry of justice. He then formed part of the Delegation of Tours, but took no part in the completion of the organization of defense. He resigned with his colleagues on 14 February 1871. Eight months later he was elected deputy, then life senator in 1875. Cr√©mieux did much to better the condition of the Jews. In 1827, he advocated the repeal of the More judaico, legislation stigmatizing the Jews left over from pre- revolutionary France.Encyclopedia Judaica, Cremieux, Isaac Adolphe He founded the Alliance Israelite Universelle in Paris in 1860, becoming its president four years later. In 1866 Cr√©mieux traveled to Saint Petersburg to successfully defend Jews of Saratov who had been accused in a case of blood libel. Cr√©mieux published a Recueil of his political cases (1869), and the Actes de la d√©l√©gation de Tours et de Bordeaux (2 vols, 1871). Cr√©mieux decree Adolphe Cr√©mieux portrayed by Jean-Jules-Antoine Lecomte du Nou√ø (1878) Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda√Øsme While in the government of the national defence, he secured full citizenship for the Jews in French-ruled Algeria, through the Cr√©mieux Decree (). The decree allowed for native Jews to become French citizens while Muslim Arabs and Berbers were excluded and remained under the second-class ‚Äòindigenous‚Äô status outlined in the Code de l'Indig√©nat. This set the scene for deteriorating relations between the Muslim and Jewish communities, and later proved fateful in the Algerian War of Independence, after which the vast majority of Algerian Jews emigrated to France. Freemasonry Initiated freemason in 1818, at \\"Bienfait Anonyme\\" Grand Orient de France lodge in N√Æmes, he joined \\"Aide-toi, le Ciel t'aidera\\" lodge in Paris during 1830.Dictionnaire universel de la Franc-ma√ßonnerie (Jode, Cara and Cara, Larousse ed., 2011) In 1866 he joined Supr√™me Conseil de France and became 33rd degree and Great Commander in 1868. During his masonic career, he encouraged republicans and monarchists to work together.Dictionnaire de la Franc-ma√ßonnerie (Daniel Ligou, Presse universitaire de France ed., 2006)Histoire de la franc-ma√ßonnerie en France - Page 297(Achille Ricker Nouvelles √©ditions latines - 1978)La franc-ma√ßonnerie - Page 33 (Jean Massicot - Deno√´l ed. - 2010)Adolphe Cr√©mieux: homme d'Etat fran√ßais, Juif et franc-ma√ßon : le combat pour la R√©publique (Georges Renauld, Detrad ed., 2002) Death Cr√©mieux died in Paris in 1880 and was buried at Montparnasse cemetery. Commemoration A street is named after him in Jerusalem's German Colony neighborhood, as well as in central Tel Aviv and the French Carmel district in Haifa. He is the subject of two lithographs by Honor√© Daumier, both poking fun at his ugliness. The first was in 1848 in the \\"Representatives Represented\\" series, with caption \\"Great lover of change, nothing would be missing from his happiness if one day he changed his face!\\" The other was a year later, captioned, \\"Mr. Cr√©mieux looking for an apartment: If I rent this lodging, I would like the landlord to take down this dreadful portrait... oh! but, Good God, it's a mirror!...\\" References * External links * CAIRN.INFO: Isaac-Jacob Adolphe Cr√©mieux, Avocat, homme politique, pr√©sident du Consistoire central et de l‚ÄôAlliance isra√©lite universelle (in French) * Biblioth√®que de l'Alliance isra√©lite universelle: AP W 14 ‚Äì CREMIEUX Adolphe et Am√©lie (don Nicole GODCHAUX) (in French) * Association Culturelle des Juifs du Pape: CREMIEUX (in French) * GeneaNet: Jean Herv√© FAVRE's family tree: Adolphe CREMIEUX (some text in French) Category:1796 births Category:1880 deaths Category:People from N√Æmes Category:Politicians from Occitanie Category:Jewish French politicians Category:Republican Union (France) politicians Category:French Ministers of Justice Category:Members of the 6th Chamber of Deputies of the July Monarchy Category:Members of the 7th Chamber of Deputies of the July Monarchy Category:Members of the 1848 Constituent Assembly Category:Members of the National Legislative Assembly of the French Second Republic Category:Members of the 4th Corps l√©gislatif of the Second French Empire Category:Members of the National Assembly (1871) Category:French Life Senators Category:French Freemasons Category:French lawyers Category:Aix-Marseille University alumni Category:Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery ","title":"Adolphe Cr√©mieux"},{"id":"2611446","text":"Inpress was a free weekly tabloid-sized music magazine (street press) that was published in Melbourne, and was released in the Geelong and Mornington Peninsula areas of Victoria, Australia.

It was developed in western Cuba by Kongo slaves during colonial times. Yuka predates other Afro-Cuban genres of dance music like rumba and has survived in Kongo communities of Pinar del R√≠o, specifically in El Guayabo and Barbacoa, San Luis. Since the 1940s, yuka performances have been recorded by researchers such as Harold Courlander and Mar√≠a Teresa Linares.Linares, Mar√≠a Teresa. 1981. Liner notes to Antolog√≠a de la m√∫sica afrocubana Vol. 5: Tambor yuka [recorded in 1978]. EGREM: Havana, Cuba. Music =Drumming= The Bantu word yuka means \\"to beat\\" and is also used to refer to the drums used in yuka performances. According to Fernando Ortiz, yuka drums were known in the Kongo language as ng√≥ma bob√≥la m√°mbu, where ng√≥ma means \\"drum\\", bob√≥la \\"deep sound\\" and m√°mbu \\"collective business\\". These drums are made from hollowed-out trunks of the avocado tree. Leather is nailed to one of the open ends, and the player hits the skin with both hands, the drum being slanted between his legs. The drums come in three sizes: *caja, the largest and lowest-pitched yuka drum; *mula, medium sized; *cachimbo, the smallest and highest-pitched drum, it is also known as tumba, tumbador, llamador or tahona. Modern conga drums, also known as tumbadoras, may descend from the yuka drums. Rhythms may also be played on the drum body, the drummer using a small mallet or a stave in one hand, the other hand slapping the leather. The drummer wears two small rattles (nkemb√≠), made of metal or gourds, on his wrists. The drums may be accompanied by staves on a guagua (hollow wooden slit drum) or the drum body, and by percussion on a piece of iron, the muela or a guataca (a hoe pick used for plowing).Le√≥n, Argiliers 1964. Del canto y el tiempo. La Habana. p. 67. The yuka accompanied by this guataca bell plays a variation of the commonly used tresillo pattern. =Singing= Like most Afro-Cuban music, yuka singing is based on call and response. Songs have a simple structure and sung phrases are generally short. There is a main motif over which singers are allowed to improvise. Dance The secular dance is performed by a couple as a stylised contest: the man chases, the woman avoids.Orovio, Helio 2003. Cuban music from A to Z. p. 230. The origin of the yuka lies in western Cuba, particularly Matanzas and Pinar del R√≠o, where it gave rise to the yamb√∫ style of rumba. There are several dance moves in yuka that are not found in rumba, such as ronquido (side steps) and campanero (figure eight).

Wilksch engines run on jet fuel, which is cheaper and more widely available than avgas. The company, founded in 1994, manufactures two-stroke compression ignition engines. In a maiden flight in a Piper J-3 Cub on 21 November 1997, an 80-horsepower 2-cylinder prototype engine became the first two-stroke diesel aircraft engine to fly in over 50 years. The company then concentrated on developing a three-cylinder 120 hp WAM engine, which first flew in December 1999. In 2005 the Wilksch company announced a manufacturing deal with Lister Petter ‚Äî effectively the WAM (Wilksch Air Motive) company would lease space, but would actually manufacture at the Lister Petter factory in Gloucestershire, UK. In the following 18 months from 2004 some 40 engines were made; to date it is believed that about 20 have flown in kit built aircraft in places as far apart as Brazil, the United States, Sweden, Germany, France and the UK. In 2004 Mark Wilksch raised part equity and part loan investment in Wilksch Airmotive from an investor group consisting of Mike Newton, Patrick Head and John Murray. By 2006 the company faced serious and critical financial difficulties. There was further investment by prior shareholders, and the Investor Group exercised their options to convert loans to equity at a reduced price based on financial performance to date. Headed by Mike Newton, albeit in a Non Exec director role on behalf of the Investor Group, the Company continued to work on correcting the defects and refining the Indirect Injection (IDI) versions of the \\"WAM\\" engine while Mark Wilksch separately concentrated on Direct Injection (DI) concepts. Wilksch Airmotive moved into custom built premises at Gloucestershire Airport in 2009, following temporary accommodation on the site where they continued to develop their diesel engines. New test cells were commissioned in portable containerized form, in which they run the engines to JAR, FAR and ASTM cycles. WAM moved to a low volume production regime of the existing design and returned to development with the aim of creating the next generation of engines, namely a larger capacity version of the three-cylinder engine and (in due course) a four-cylinder version. A revised version of the original engine was released as the WAM100-LSA targeted at LSA aircraft at 100HP. By early 2008 the WAM100-LSA had completed the required ASTM F2538 test cycles and subsequent inspections for 1,000hr TBO with the performance testing already complete to achieve a 2000Hr TBO. It was clear however that the original power targets could not be achieved without fundamental deign changes. During 2008, development of the WAM125BB and projected WAM167BB commenced. This incorporated the following changes - # Lower cost / easier to manufacture ‚Äòconventional‚Äô connecting rod # Revised piston with conventional little end pin # Increased bore # Increased Stroke # Reduced BMEP (i.e. rating or stress) # Alternative pre-combustion chambers to remove any inherent failure mode in the previous design, and also improving combustion efficiency for improved SFC. By the end of 2012, the WAM125BB had completed over 2000hrs of JAR and FAR Endurance test cycles on the dyno - supporting a deliverable 2000hr TBO certified engine target under either FAA or EASA rules. The prototype WAM167BB four cylinder engine was also in the initial stages of manufacture, with two prototypes subsequently running on the dyno and performing well within target expectations. Both WAM125BB and WAM167BB engines delivered improved SFC and reduced noise and vibration in addition to the improved durability. However despite the significant further investment to this stage the market position for JET-A1 fuelled light aircraft had changed, and there was little appetite at that time for the further investment to perform certification and series production. In 2018, as exploration for alternative investment opportunities had been exhausted, Mike Newton announced the acquisition of the assets into his specialist engineering company, Apple Tree Innovation Ltd and the relocation of the assets to Cheshire, and as off late 2019 the facilities have been partly recommissioned, with agreement with a local engine specialist for ongoing support if required for engine manufacture or rebuilds. Apple Tree Innovation continue to make parts available for existing WAM Engine customers. Apple Tree Innovation continues to review market opportunities, including the 'single fuel' UAV sector, and also investigating potential hybrid versions leveraging the automotive EV developments also within Apple Tree, with research into counter rotating independent propellers solutions sponsored at MACE ( School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering, University of Manchester ). A recent article in Unmanned Systems Technology Magazine described the engine targeted for UAV applications.

G. Wells' classic 1898 science fiction novel The War of the Worlds. It is one of the four types of heavy machine the Martians bring with them when they invade Earth, along with the fighting machine, the handling machine, and the embankment machine. Description The appearance of this aircraft in the novel is very vague. The narrator's brother, escaping by sea, glimpses it shortly after the implied destruction of the Channel Fleet. The narrator himself sees the aircraft abandoned on the ground in London, and believes it is experimental, until he reads otherwise in a post-invasion issue of the Daily Mail. It is implied the aircraft was used to dispense the black smoke, but there is no clear confirmation of this in the text. In the original 1897 Pearson's Magazine serialized version, Wells gave more information: It is not known whether this version is considered canon, having only appeared, as noted, in the original magazine serialization; Wells re-edited portions of the novel before it was first published in 1898 as a hardcover book. In other adaptations The appearance of the flying machine has only so far been depicted once in Pendragon Pictures direct-to-video H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, where it makes an appearance after the battle with , which is later recounted from the perspective of the artilleryman. The flying machine appeared briefly in the live adaptation of Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds, though the album itself does not make any reference to the craft. Many more of them appeared in the later New Generation version of the stage show. The roughly Manta-ray-shaped war machines of George Pal's 1953 film bear no resemblance to the tripods described in Well's novel; they might be an oblique reference to the novel's Martian flying machine. Their design actually derived from a complication of making convincing walking tripods with special effects at the time, so instead were given three \\"invisible legs\\" to support and lift them from the ground. In the pilot episode of the War of the Worlds TV series, a sequel to the 1953 film, these same machines are seen but the \\"legs\\" are not present and are given more of the look of taking flight, but still possessing the speed and movement of their film counterparts. The flying machines are also featured in both the computer game and the PlayStation game Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds. In the games the flying machines are equipped with one Heat-Ray and light armor, but in turn, are highly maneuverable and extremely fast. A common tactic in the PC game involves the mass production of these units in order to rush an entrenched human sector. In Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds, the Martians only have a single flying machine with them, and it is described as being shaped like a traditional flying saucer. In the postscript, when the Martians invade Venus, the flying machine is shown to have been unable to handle in the planet's thicker atmosphere and so crashed onto the surface. In Superman: War of the Worlds, the flying machine is not a separate machine; instead it is actually a part of the tripods, shown during the climax of the story: Superman tries to bring down a fighting machine by pulling its legs, only to discover that the machine's hood has detached itself and is floating in the air; the Martians have had time to adjust to Earth's gravity. He destroys it by throwing another tripod under it, negating its anti-gravity. Scarlet Traces is a War of the Worlds sequel based on Great Britain having benefited from the Martian technology left behind after their failed invasion. While spider-like machines have dominated the means of land travel, the Martians' flying machines have greatly influenced air travel, with aircraft by 1908 looking much like modern era planes. Flying machines appear in The Asylum's film War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave, the sequel to H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds. The \\"squid- walkers\\" are a living race of Tripods controlled by a single entity inside the mothership. They each carry a kind of Heat Ray and need human blood to survive, so they transport living humans to the mothership to drain their blood. Their weapons are powerful enough to destroy buildings as well as humans; one scene shows a fleet of squid-walkers completely destroying London and Paris.

A new prison, HMP Addiewell, opened in 2008. History There are two separate districts, Addiebrownhill and Loganlea. Addiewell is near Stoneyburn and West Calder. There is one church, namely St Thomas the Apostle Church (of the Roman Catholic Church). The former church of Scotland is now used as a warehouse by the owner of one of the village shops. In 1852 James Young left Manchester to return to live in Scotland. On return he bought the United States-registered patent for the production of paraffin oil by distillation of coal, known as the oil shale industry. Both the US and UK patents were subsequently upheld in both countries in a series of lawsuits, and other producers were obliged to pay him royalties. After his patents expired in 1864, in 1865 Young bought out his business partners at the Bathgate-based chemical works, and choose to build a larger factory at Addiewell, due to its location on the Breich river. After agreeing purchase of west from the village of West Calder, Young needed to develop a model village for his workers. Finding clay beneath the soil, he built a brickworks, allowing him to greatly reduce construction costs. Laid out on the principles set out by Cadbury at Bournville, and developed mainly between 1865 and 1870, a public school was built with accommodation for 327 children. Young named a number of the streets after his heroes, namely: Humphry Davy; Michael Faraday; David Livingstone; Robert Stephenson; and James Watt. However, he operated the village on the principles the developers of the South Wales Coalfield, where by workers were paid in a local currency to ensure that their wages were spent within the village, and that the men did not over drink alcohol. =Addiewell chemical works= Employing 700 workers, Young found that the heavily polluted river could not be used for production purposes, and so was forced to drive his own water wells. At peak production, the plant consumed annually: * of water * of coal, used also to power the steam engines * of bituminous shale * of sulphuric acid * of caustic soda In output, it produced: * of illuminating oil * of lubricating oil * of naphtha * of paraffin * of ammonium sulfate, a fertilizer The plant burnt its own liquid waste, the coal ash was used to repair local roads, while the of shale waste was disposed by conveyor belt to local waste heaps. Due to the volume of materials required to enable the works, Young in part sponsored the Caledonian Railway's Cleland and Midcalder Line. In 1866 Young sold the company to Young's Paraffin Light and Mineral Oil Company. Although the nearby Woodmuir colliery had supplied coal to the works, its workforce was excluded from living in the village until Young sold the company. When the reserves of torbanite eventually gave out, the company moved on to pioneer the exploitation of West Lothian's oil shale deposits, the only workable deposits in Europe outside Russia, if not so rich in oil as torbanite. By the 1900s nearly 2 million tons of shale were being extracted annually across West Lothian, employing 4,000 men. The refinery closed in 1921, the associated candle works in 1923. The reduction in workers brought about the demolition of some of the early housing. The paraffin works were due to close pre-World War II, but were saved by the onset of hostilities by virtue of reducing imports. After the paraffin works closed in 1956, the site remained derelict until the last buildings were cleared in 1986. Present Addiewell post office Addiewell has a combined school, comprising St Thomas' RC and Addiewell Primary and an on site community centre, constructed to complement the schools and provide a function hall for all local groups. Addiewell has three shops, one pub and a community facility/softplay/gym called The Pitstop. The local football team is called Loganlea United. The prison, built to hold up to 800 maximum security prisoners on the site of the former chemical works, opened in December 2008. Representation Addiewell is part of the Livingston UK Parliament constituency, currently represented by Hannah Bardell of the Scottish National Party. Addiewell is part of the Almond Valley constituency in the Scottish Parliament, represented by the locally raised Angela Constance of the Scottish National Party. Transport Developed as part of the Caledonian Railway's Cleland and Midcalder Line, Addiewell railway station is now on the Shotts Line from Glasgow Central to Edinburgh Waverley. With an hourly service in each direction, it has recently been upgraded to support the new prison.

MAC is used to compare the strengths, or potency, of anaesthetic vapours. The concept of MAC was first introduced in 1965. MAC actually is a median value, not a minimum as term implies. The original paper proposed MAC as the minimal alveolar concentration, which was shortly thereafter revised to minimum alveolar concentration. A lower MAC value represents a more potent volatile anesthetic. Other uses of MAC include MAC-BAR (1.7-2.0 MAC), which is the concentration required to block autonomic reflexes to nociceptive stimuli, and MAC-awake (0.3-0.5 MAC), the concentration required to block voluntary reflexes and control perceptive awareness. Formal definition The MAC is the concentration of the vapour (measured as a percentage at 1 atmosphere, i.e. the partial pressure) that prevents patient movement in response to a supramaximal Miller ANESTHESIOLOGY stimulus (traditionally a set depth and width of skin incisions) in 50% of subjects. This measurement is done at steady state (assuming a constant alveolar concentration for 15 minutes), under the assumption that this allows for an equilibration between the gasses in the alveoli, the blood and the brain. MAC is accepted as a valid measure of potency of inhalational general anaesthetics because it remains fairly constant for a given species even under varying conditions. Meyer-Overton hypothesis The MAC of a volatile substance is inversely proportional to its lipid solubility (oil:gas coefficient), in most cases. This is the Meyer- Overton hypothesis put forward in 1899‚Äì1901 by Hans Horst Meyer and Charles Ernest Overton. MAC is inversely related to potency, i.e. high MAC equals low potency. The hypothesis correlates lipid solubility of an anaesthetic agent with potency (1/MAC) and suggests that onset of anaesthesia occurs when sufficient molecules of the anaesthetic agent have dissolved in the cell's lipid membranes, resulting in anaesthesia. Exceptions to the Meyer-Overton hypothesis can result from: * convulsant property of an agent * specific receptor (various agents may exhibit an additional effect through specific receptors) * co-administration of Alpha2 agonists (dexmedetomidine) and/or opioid receptor agonists (morphine/fentanyl) can decrease the MAC* * Mullin's critical volume hypothesis * Positive modulation of GABA at GABAA receptors by barbiturates or benzodiazepines Factors affecting MAC Certain physiological and pathological states may alter MAC. For example, MAC increases with hyperthermia and hypernatremia. interestingly, human subjects with red hair have also been found to have increased MAC. Conversely, anemia, hypercarbia, hypoxia, hypothermia, hypotension (MAP < 40 mmHg), and pregnancy seem to decrease MAC. Duration of anesthesia, gender, height and weight seem to have little effect on MAC. Age has been shown to affect MAC. MAC begins to rise at one month of age with a peak at approximately 6 months of age. There is a subsequent steady decline in MAC with increasing age, with the exception of another peak during puberty. There is a linear model that describes the change in MAC of approximately 6% per decade of age. Medications, illicit drugs, and prior substance use history have also been found to affect MAC. For example, acute use of amphetamines, cocaine, ephedrine, and chronic use of alcohol increase MAC. Whereas, administration of propofol, etomidate, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ketamine, opiates, local anesthetics, lithium, verapamil, and alpha 2-agonists (dexmedetomidine, clonidine) decrease MAC. Acute alcohol intoxication and chronic amphetamine use have also been found to decrease MAC. MAC values are additive. For instance, when applying 0.3 MAC of drug X and 1 MAC of drug Y the total MAC achieved is 1.3 MAC. In this way nitrous oxide is often used as a \\"carrier\\" gas to decrease the anesthetic requirement of other drugs. Common MAC values Values are known to decrease with age and the following are given based on a 40-year-old (MAC40):* * Nitrous oxide - 104 * Xenon - 72 * Desflurane - 6.6 * Ethyl Ether - 3.2 * Sevoflurane - 1.8 * Enflurane - 1.63 * Isoflurane - 1.17 * Halothane - 0.75 * Chloroform - 0.5 * Methoxyflurane - 0.16 References Category:Anesthesia ","title":"Minimum alveolar concentration"},{"id":"2611518","text":"Addington is a village in the English county of Kent. It is close to the M20 motorway, and between the villages of Wrotham Heath and West Malling. The Domesday Book called it Eddintune. The meaning of the village's name is \\"√Üddi's (or Eadda's) estate\\". The village is notable for the long barrows, Neolithic chamber tombs. Its parish covers a little under , containing 291 houses. Addington Brook runs through the parish. History Addington has been continuously inhabited for over 5,000 years. Many Neolithic artifacts have been extracted from the village, but much archaeological evidence has been lost to mechanical digging. Some sites were excavated during the building of the motorway. It had two mills at the time of the Domesday survey. There was a watermill powered by the Addington Brook (TQ 656 587 ), demolished in the nineteenth century; the site now lies within West Malling Golf Course. The remains of an old structure named the Addington Place were visible until the early 21st century, now beneath a golf course and stables. Features There is one pub, the Angel. There are rumours of a tunnel from the basement to the church away. No school is in the village, so children attend schools in nearby villages. Addington is completely divided by the M20 and M26 motorways. It is scarred on both sides of the motorways with sandpits and quarries, which are now almost entirely worked out. The village is home to Addington Village Cricket Club, which has two Saturday teams and a 1st XI in Division 2 of the Kent League (1st XI). St Margaret's Church The parish church is dedicated to St. Margaret, currently led by the Reverend Linda Shuker. Traces of the former gardens of Addington Park can still be seen. Rockeries, ponds and old tennis courts are easily discernible in the private grounds of the Seekers Trust between a church and the golf course.

Life =Anglican chaplain= Hugh Paulinus de Cressy was born at Thorpe Salvin, Yorkshire, about 1605, the son of Hugh de Cressy and Margery d'Oylie of London. Educated first at Wakefield Grammar school, when fourteen years old he went to Oxford, where he took the degree of B.A. in 1623 and that of M.A. in 1627. He attended became a fellow of Merton College, earning his Masters degree in theology the following year.Hind, George. \\"Hugh Paulinus Serenus Cressy.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 9 December 2014 Having taken Anglican orders, after leaving Oxford he served as chaplain to Lord Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, and then to Lord Lucius Cary, 3rd Viscount Falkland, whom Cressy accompanied to Ireland in 1638. During his stay in Ireland, Cressy was appointed as Dean of Leighlin, but returned to England in 1639. He received the post of canon in the collegiate chapter of Windsor, Berkshire, in 1642, but was not able to occupy the position due to the troubled times England was experiencing then. =Roman Catholic Benedictine= After his patron, Lord Falkland, was killed in battle in 1643, Cressy went into the service of Lord Charles Berkeley, who later was to become the 1st Earl of Falmouth. For some time he traveled abroad as tutor to Lord Falmouth, through the countries of Roman Catholic Europe, where he was exposed to the life and thought of that faith. Upon arriving in Rome in 1646, Cressy made the decision to enter the Roman Catholic Church. George Henry Tavard believes this decision was hastened by events of the English Civil War which brought Cressy to exile in France, where a number of Anglican High-Church adherents found French Catholicism not far from their own sympathies. Cressy took exception to the Protestant emphasis on scripture alone without authoritative interpretation. At this point he traveled to Paris to take instruction from the Reverend Henry Holden, an English theologian at the Sorbonne. He then published his most noted work, the Exomologesis, wherein he explained the motives which led him to change his religion. In some ways Cressy's views on Tradition prefigure John Henry Newman's observations in his 1845 Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine. When he had become a Roman Catholic, Cressy considered entering the Carthusians, but eventually opted to join the Benedictine Order, which he did in 1648. He was so poor, however, that Queen Henrietta Maria had to give him money for the journey. He then entered the novitiate of the English Congregation of Benedictines, which was based in Douai, France and was given the name of Serenus, by which he is now known. He professed monastic vows on 22 August 1649. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1651. That same year he was sent to serve as chaplain to the monastery of English Benedictine nuns, then still in Paris. While there he began his work on the text of Julian of Norwich.McAvoy, Liz Herbert. Authority and the Female Body in the Writings of Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe, p.225, Boydell & Brewer, 2004, Returning to his own monastery in Douai, he undertook an extensive study of the history of monasticism in England. He also translated several works by various English mystical writers across a span of centuries. Cressy was assigned to return to England in 1660 to serve as one of the chaplains to Queen Catherine of Braganza, wife of King Charles II of England and a Roman Catholic. For four years he resided at Somerset House, which served as her official residence.Juliana of Norwich. XVI revelations of divine love, publ. by S. Cressy, Preface, S. Clarke, London, 1843 He was involved in theological controversies with Bishop George Worley of Worcester and Edward Stillingfleet.Tavard, George Henry. The Seventeenth-Century Tradition: A Study in Recusant Thought, Brill, 1978, He then went to provide spiritual care to the Catholic Caryll family and died at East Grinstead, Sussex on 10 August 1674. He is described as a quick and accurate disputant, a man of good nature and manners, and no inconsiderable preacher. He is also said to have been particularly temperate in controversy. Works He published his Exomologesis (Paris, 1647), or account of his conversion; it was valued by Roman Catholics as an answer to William Chillingworth's attacks. Cressy's major work, The Church History of Brittanny or England, from the beginning of Christianity to the Norman Conquest (1st vol. only published, Rouen, 1668), gives an exhaustive account of the foundation of monasteries during the Saxon heptarchy, and asserts that they followed the Benedictine Rule, differing in this respect from many historians. The work was criticized by Lord Clarendon, but defended by Anthony √† Wood in his Athenae Oxoniensis, who supports Cressy's statement that it was compiled from original manuscripts and from the Annales Ecclesiae of Michael Alford, William Dugdale's Monasticon, and the Decem Scriptores Historiae Anglicanae. The second part of the history, which has never been printed, was discovered at Douai in 1856. Cressy also edited Walter Hilton's Scale of Perfection (London, 1659); Dom Augustine Baker's Sancta Sophia (2 vols, Douai, 1657);Baker, Augustine. Holy Wisdom: or, Directions for the Prayer of Contemplation, CCEL, and Julian of Norwich's Sixteen Revelations on the Love of God (1670). These books might have been lost but for Cressy's zeal. For a complete list of Cressy's works see Joseph Gillow's Bibliographical Dictionary of the English Catholics, vol. I.

SIPPs are \\"tax wrappers\\", allowing tax rebates on contributions in exchange for limits on accessibility. The HMRC rules allow for a greater range of investments to be held than personal pension schemes, notably equities and property. Rules for contributions, benefit withdrawal etc. are the same as for other personal pension schemes. Another subset of this type of pension is the stakeholder pension scheme. History The rules and conditions for a broader range of investments were originally set out in Joint Office Memorandum 101 issued by the UK's Inland Revenue in 1989. However, the first true SIPP was taken out in March 1990. James Hay Partnership, the parent company of then Personal Pension Management, offered the first SIPP product. The second SIPP provider followed quickly afterwards and was called Provident Life, launching its own version a few months later. All three companies were based in Salisbury, Wiltshire where James Hay Partnership remained one of the largest SIPP providers.The Telegraph - 25 Years of the DIY Pension (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/sipps/11511167/25-years- of-the-DIY-pension-Why-Sipps-now-have-mass-appeal.html) The Finance Act 2004 implemented wide-ranging changes to the UK pensions regime, most of which came into force on 6 April 2006 (also known as A-Day) and is commonly referred to as pension simplification.HMRC Registered Pension Scheme Manual (http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pensionschemes/css-0607.htm) Structure Unlike conventional personal pensions where the provider as trustee has ownership and control of the assets, in a SIPP the member may have ownership of the assets (via an individual trust) as long as the scheme administrator is a co-trustee to exercise control. In practice, most SIPPs do not work this way and simply have the provider as SIPP trustee. The role of the scheme administrator in this situation is to control what is happening and to ensure that the requirements for tax approval continue to be met. The pensions industry has gravitated towards four industry terms to describe generic SIPP types: # Deferred. This is effectively a personal pension scheme in which most or all of the pension assets are generally held in insured pension funds (although some providers will offer direct access to mutual funds). Self-investment or income withdrawal activity is deferred until an indeterminate date, and this gives rise to the name. In some newer schemes of this type, there are over a thousand fund options, so they are not as restrictive as they once were. # Hybrid. A scheme in which some of the assets must always be held in conventional insured pension funds, with the rest being able to be 'self- invested'. This has been a common offering from mainstream personal pension providers, who require insured funds in order to derive their product charges. # Pure or full. Schemes offer unrestricted access to many allowable investment asset classes. # SIPP Lite or Single Investment.http://www.minervasipp.co.uk/pension-services/sipp-lite/ A recent trend towards schemes that feature much lower fees for investments that are typically placed in only one asset. For these purposes, an investment platform or a stockbroker/discretionary fund manager account usually is classed as a single investment. An upgrade to a full SIPP in the future may be allowed, depending on the scheme. Investment choice Investors may make choices about what assets are bought, leased or sold, and decide when those assets are acquired or disposed of, subject to the agreement of the SIPP trustees (usually the SIPP provider). All assets are permitted by HMRC, however some will be subject to tax charges. The assets that are not subject to a tax charge are: * Stocks and shares listed on a recognised exchange * Futures and options traded on a recognised futures exchange * Authorised UK unit trusts and open-ended investment companies and other UCITS funds * Unauthorised unit trusts that do not invest in residential property * Unlisted shares * Investment trusts subject to FCA regulation * Unitised insurance funds from EU insurers and IPAs * Deposits and deposit interests * Commercial property (including hotel rooms) * Ground rents (as long as they do not contain any element of residential property) * Traded endowments policies * Derivatives products such as a contract for difference (CFD) * Gold bullion, which is specifically allowed for in legislation, provided it is \\"investment grade\\" Investments currently permitted by primary legislation but subsequently made subject to heavy tax penalties (and therefore typically not allowed by SIPP providers) include: * Any item of tangible movable property (whose market value does not exceed ¬£6,000) ‚Äì subject to further conditions on use of property * \\"Exotic\\" assets like vintage cars, wine, stamps, and art * Residential property Tax treatment Contributions to SIPPs are treated identically to contributions to other types of personal pension. Contributions are limited to ¬£3,600 (¬£2,880 before 20% tax refund) or 100% of earned income (if higher). The maximum was ¬£255,000 for the 2010/11 tax year but the 'Annual Allowance' for all pension contributions was decreased to ¬£50,000 for tax years 2012/13 and 2013/14, and was decreased further to ¬£40,000 starting with the 2014/15 tax year. The SIPP provider claims a tax refund at the basic rate on behalf of the customer (i.e. you pay ¬£2,880 and your fund contribution for the year will become ¬£3,600). The 20% is usually added to the 'pot' some 6‚Äì11 weeks after your payment is made. Higher rate and additional rate taxpayers must claim any additional tax refund through their tax return if they have one, or by otherwise contacting HMRC (being a higher rate taxpayer, being self-employed or having paid too much tax, are all triggers for being requested to complete a tax return). Employer contributions are usually allowable against corporation tax or income tax. Income from assets within the scheme is untaxed (although prior to the abolition of UK Dividend Tax Credit in April 2016, those credits could not be reclaimed). Growth is free from capital gains tax (CGT). At any time after the SIPP holder reaches early retirement age (55 from April 2010) they may elect to take a pension from some or all of their fund. After taking up to 25% as a tax-free Pension Commencement Lump Sum, the remaining money can either be moved into 'drawdown' (where it remains invested) or used to purchase an annuity. Drawdown income may be \\"capped\\", typically limited to that obtainable with an annuity according to the Government Actuary's Department (GAD). This is reviewed every three years until age 75 and annually thereafter. This limit does not apply to plan holders in \\"Flexi Access Drawdown\\", who may take any amount from their fund from age 55. Pension income is taxed as if it is earned income at the member's highest marginal rate. Rules exist to prevent the Pension Commencement Lump Sum being recycled back into the SIPP (and neither drawdown nor annuity payments count as earned income for the purpose of making SIPP contributions). If the fund value exceeds the lifetime allowance, the amount above the lifetime allowance will be taxed at 55%. The lifetime allowance was ¬£1.8 million in the 2010‚Äì11 and 2011-12 tax years. From April 2012 the lifetime allowance fell to ¬£1.5 million but there are provisions for those previously relying on the higher limit. In the Chancellor's 2012 Autumn Statement, it was confirmed that the lifetime allowance would fall further, to ¬£1.25 million from 6 April 2014 (again with the option of certain individuals being able to claim the previous level of lifetime allowance). In March 2015, a further reduction to ¬£1 million was announced from 6 April 2016, with the allowance to be adjusted for inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index, starting in 2018. SIPPs can borrow up to 50% of the net value of the pension fund to invest in any assets.

He was prominent as an elected official in Finland, as minister of foreign affairs in the 1918 Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic, a founder of the Communist Party of Finland, and as a functionary of the Communist International. Background Yrj√∂ Esias Sir√©n was born 8 November 1876 in Piikki√∂, Finland, then part of the Russian Empire. His father, Karl Gustaf Sir√©n, worked as a clergyman.David Kirby, \\"Yrj√∂ Esias Sirola,\\" in A. Thomas Lane (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders: M-Z. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995; pg. 899. Yrj√∂ attended a lyc√©e in Viipuri and then attended Rauma teachers' training college, from which he graduated in 1902. Career Following completion of his studies he took a post as a teacher in Hattula. =Social Democratic Party (Finland)= Yrj√∂ joined the Social Democratic Party in 1903. After a short stint on the staff of the liberal newspaper Kotkan Sanomat (Kotka News) in 1903, Yrj√∂ moved to the city of Tampere to assume the editorship of the Kansan Lehti, a post which he occupied from 1904 to 1906. It is apparently during this period that he adopted the pseudonym Sirola, which he retained for the rest of his life. Sirola also served as editor of the Helsinki Ty√∂mies (\\"Workman\\") from 1906. In 1905, Sirola was appointed as Secretary of the SDP, a role which enabled him to play an active part in the general strike of that year.Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pg. 431. An advocate of parliamentary methods during a revolutionary time, Sirola found himself out of step with a boisterous radical rank-and-file in the Social Democratic Party and withdrew his name from consideration in the elections for Secretary held at the party's 1906 national conference. The Russian imperial government of Nicholas II managed to stabilize itself by 1907, defeating the radical opponents which threatened to topple it in the Revolution of 1905. Sirola remained active in the socialist movement following this defeat, gaining election to parliament and serving as deputy speaker in 1908 and 1909. Increased control by the Tsarist government over Finnish affairs in the aftermath of the revolution combined with a troubled personal financial situation moved Sirola to emigrate to the United States, however. =American years= Yrj√∂ Sirola with family in Hancock, Michigan (1913) Arriving in America in 1909, Sirola followed previous Finnish immigrants in moving to the Upper Midwest region of the United States. Sirola landed a post as the director of the Finnish Socialist Federation's Work People's College in Smithville, Minnesota in 1910. Sirola would remain in that position until 1913. Previously very much a parliamentarian in his political orientation, while in Minnesota Sirola begun to be influenced by the radical syndicalism espoused by the Industrial Workers of the World. He would support the left wing in the bitter factional dispute which in 1912 and 1913 split the more than 10,000 member Finnish Socialist organization in America. Amidst this rancor, Sirola returned home to Finland in 1913. =Finnish Revolution= Back in Finland, Sirola resumed activity as a functionary of the Social Democratic Party, teaching in party schools and writing for the party press. In 1916 he was elected the SDP's Executive Committee and in 1917 he was returned to office as a parliamentary deputy. Within the SDP Sirola was a leader of the radical left wing of the party who supported the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in November 1917 and who sought to emulate Lenin's results in Finland. On November 11, 1917, Sirola arrived in Petrograd with his comrade Evert Huttunen, where he met with Lenin at Smolnyi about how radicals in Finland might aid the Bolshevik uprising and about revolutionary prospects in Finland.C. Jay Smith, Jr., Finland and the Russian Revolution, 1917-1922. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1958; pg. 26. Lenin was fearful that troops loyal to the Provisional Government of Alexander Kerensky would be pulled from Finland to crush the Bolshevik uprising. He urged the Finns to initiate a general strike in an effort to emulate the Bolsheviks in their seizure of power.Anthony F. Upton, The Finnish Revolution, 1917-1918. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1980; pp. 146-147; Smith, Finland and the Russian Revolution, pg. 26. Smith emphasizes Lenin's advocacy of a general strike as a diversionary tactic, Upton indicates Lenin sought his Finnish comrades to make a direct bid for power. Sirola and Huttunen took the opposite impression from this meeting with Lenin than the one which the Russian leader had intended, however, interpreting the Bolshevik grip on power as being extremely tenuous and believing it dangerous for the Finnish SDP to build its plans around the survival of the Bolshevik government.Upton, The Finnish Revolution, 1917-1918, pg. 147. This cautious perspective was shared by the SDP's parliamentary group, but radicals in the party pushed the revolution forward nonetheless, calling a general strike for November 14. Sirola was one of three SDP leaders to exercise general control over the strike arrangements.Upton, The Finnish Revolution, 1917-1918, pg. 150. As one historian has noted: > The instructions for the conduct of the strike required that in each > community a revolutionary council would be set up with full authority over > all workers' organizations, above all the Red Guard, which was to be the > executive arm of the workers' power. The Red Guard would work with the > militia in keeping order, mount guards and patrols, arrest dangerous enemies > of the workers, confiscate liquor stocks, and stop the spread of rumors. The > instruction ended with the standard injunction that \\"during the general > strike, order and discipline must be preserved irreproachably. It must be > remember that revolution is not the same as outrage and anarchy.\\"Upton, The > Finnish Revolution, 1917-1918, pp. 150-151. Each community experienced the general strike that launched the Finnish Revolutionary Government in a different way, ranging from complete inaction to Red Guards nailing shut the doors of stubborn businessmen who defied the strike.Upton, The Finnish Revolution, 1917-1918, pg. 151. The success of the action generated pressure among the working class to move to a full seizure of power in emulation of the Bolshevik seizure of power a week earlier.Upton, The Finnish Revolution, 1917-1918, pg. 155. Sirola still held that the armed seizure of power was premature, however. He argued at a meeting of the SDP's Revolutionary Council convened in the early morning hours of November 16 that \\"the position in Russian and the eventual attack of the Germans\\" was decisive and that the prudent course of action was to pressure parliament into making concessions, guaranteeing action on food and granting and back wages to those who participated in the general strike action.Upton, The Finnish Revolution, 1917-1918, pg. 157. The parliamentary delegates taking such a cautious position were in a minority, however, and at 5:00 am the Revolutionary Council voted 14‚Äì11 in favor of seizing power. The Revolutionary Council was reorganized, with Sirola and the parliamentary group (the minority) refusing to take part. Two hours later their nerve of the majority failed them, however, and the newly reorganized Revolutionary Council backed away from armed insurrection, in favor of an aggressive push for concessions from the bourgeois parties. As Anthony Upton notes: > In effect Sirola had won and emerged as the leading figure on the morning of > 16 November; his policy, that of stepping up the pressure until they got a > government that would satisfy the basic demands on food and guarantee > immunity from reprisal, was adopted. On his suggestion, they decided to take > over the railways, close the law courts, and compel all the agencies of > central and local government to cease activity... There was also an attempt > to satisfy the restlessness of the Red Guard by assigning to it a new task: > It was to begin systematic searches for hidden stocks of food, if possible > with the authorization of local Food Boards, but if necessary > without...Upton, The Finnish Revolution, 1917-1918, pp. 157-158. On their own authority the Red Guard began arresting and jailing bourgeois notables, however, and the drive towards revolution careened forwards. On November 18, a group of angry railway workers came to see the SDP leaders, telling party leader Kullervo Manner to his face \\"you have betrayed the workers, the strike must go on until a socialist government is established.\\"Upton, The Finnish Revolution, 1917-1918, pg. 162. The Strike Committee met that same night and declared in favor of a socialist government and that the Red Guard must stay armed until this was achieved and \\"all power is taken into the workers' hands.\\" The conservative government headed by P.E. Svinhufvud refused to make concessions to the socialist opposition, with parliament voting down proposals to lower the voting age and to grant the vote immediately to tenant farmers. A new cabinet was put together by Svinhufvud which did not include a single socialist, a body confirmed by parliament on November 24 by a vote of 100 to 80.Smith, Finland and the Russian Revolution, 1917-1922, pg. 28. Parliamentary maneuvering was met with spontaneous armed actions by Red Guard in various localities in which some 34 people were killed, mostly victims of Red Guard violence. This increasing hostility created an impenetrable barrier between the two sides. With the conservative parliamentary majority intent upon disarming the Red Guards and establishing a monarchical form of government, the nation descended into civil war. On January 19, 1918, a pitched battle broke out between Red Guards and the conservative Protective Corps of Viipuri, which Russian troops coming to the aid of their allies in the fight. Smith, Finland and the Russian Revolution, 1917-1922, pg. 34. Fighting spread with the Red Guards beginning the seizure of Helsinki on the night of January 27/28.Smith, Finland and the Russian Revolution, 1917-1922, pg. 36. White forces headed by General Mannerheim controlled the northernmost five-sixths of Finland, while the Reds controlled the southernmost region, containing approximately half of the country's population and including the cities of Pori, Turku, Tampere, Riihim√§ki, Helsinki, Kotka, and Viipuri.Smith, Finland and the Russian Revolution, 1917-1922, pg. 38. A Finnish Revolutionary Government was declared, in which Sirola served as Commissar of Foreign Affairs. The civil war proved to be a one-sided affair, with the superior officer corps and materiel of the White forces under Mannerheim winning the day. By the spring of 1918, with the Red government clearly on the road to military defeat at the hands of the Whites, Sirola coordinated the evacuation of the leadership of the revolutionary government. On April 7, a meeting of Finnish socialists took place in Petrograd, at which various settlement plans were discussed, with Sirola setting up an office in Petrograd to look after the refugees already beginning to arrive three days later.Upton, The Finnish Revolution, 1917-1918, pg. 495. Evacuation became official policy on April 14, 1918. Historian Anthony Upton notes: > The choices before the socialist leaders were unconditional surrender, a > glorious fight to the finish in Finland ending in almost certain martyrdom, > or a prudent withdrawal with a view to a future return. It was not a > difficult choice to make, and did not mean, as their detractors had always > claimed, that they were weak and cowardly men who betrayed their faithful > but deluded followers. They were Marxists, and could see their defeat as > only an episode in the class war, which always continued, and their duty was > not to indulge in glorious gestures of defiance, but to persevere in the > struggle.Upton, The Finnish Revolution, 1917-1918, pg. 496. The Finnish Socialist Republic fell on May 15, 1918. =Soviet years= Yrj√∂ Sirola (1918) Sirola was involved in establishing the Finnish Communist Party at the end of August 1918 in Moscow.Yrj√∂ Sirola, \\"Report on Finland\\" (March 2, 1919), Founding the Communist International: Proceedings and Documents of the First Congress, March 1919. New York: Pathfinder Press, 1987; pg. 71. The governing Central Committee of this new organization established itself in Petrograd, where it launched a daily newspaper and magazines in Finnish and Swedish and put into print over 40 pamphlets during its first year.Sirola, \\"Report on Finland,\\" pg. 71. Underground organizations of this new party were established inside Finland, where they distributed literature and conducted propaganda work. In January 1919, he was the Finnish CP's signatory to the call for the formation of the Communist International and in March of that year he was a delegate to the founding convention, held early in March 1919.Lazitch and Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, pg. 432. At the founding convention of the Comintern, Sirola delivered the report on the Finnish revolution: > Although not adequately prepared politically or militarily for such a > struggle, the workers held their ground at the front for three months, while > at the same time doing a great deal behind the lines to organize social and > economic life. > > \\"That first revolution by the Finnish proletariat was defeated. The > willingness to sacrifice and the courage of the comrades, men and women, who > fought in the Red Guard and the invaluable aid given by our Russian comrades > were not enough to repel the onslaught launched by the international gangs > of White Guards led by Finnish, Swedish, German, and Russian officers. At > the end of April, German imperialism tipped the balance by committing > regular army troops to the fight. The White Guards were then able to block > the plan to evacuate the revolution's best surviving forces to > Russia.Sirola, \\"Report on Finland,\\" pg. 70. In the wake of the Finnish uprising and its bloody aftermath, in which over 11,000 prisoners of the victorious Whites died of starvation, disease, or execution,Historian Jay Smith noted in a 1958 monograph that of 73,915 prisoners in the hands of the White Finnish Government on July 5, 1918, \\"no less than 11,783 were dead by the beginning of November.\\" Executions made up a tiny fraction of this total, with the deaths of the great mass \\"the result of malnutrition, aggravated by the filthy conditions of the prison camps.\\" Smith indicated that there was no evidence of a deliberate attempt by White authorities to engage in systematic homicide by starvation and disease. Smith, Finland and the Russian Revolution, 1917-1922, pg. 88. Sirola had clearly cast his lot with revolutionary methods as opposed to parliamentarism: > For too long, we...were imbued with the ideology of a 'united' workers' > movement. Only after the revolution did the split become unavoidable. There > was a sharp polarization. The bourgeois dictatorship in Finland gave the > extreme right wing of the old Social Democracy 'freedom' of organization and > of the press for the express purpose of pacifying the workers. These > traitors did their best to defeat the revolution the Finnish proletariat had > made the previous year and to propagandize for a peaceful workers' movement > functioning through parliament, trade unions, and cooperatives.... But the > admonitions of those bourgeois lackeys are alien to the masses, who are > tormented by prison, hunger, and poverty. The workers' memories of the White > Terror are still fresh, and they can see the living example of the > proletarian dictatorship in Russia.Sirola, \\"Report on Finland,\\" pp. 70-71. Sirola also represented the Finnish party at the meetings of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI). While he was not a delegate to the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern in 1920, he did attend the 3rd World Congress in 1921 and in June 1922 took part in the 2nd Enlarged Plenum of ECCI. People's Commissar of Education in the Soviet Republic of Karelia, close to the Finnish border. Return to America Max Bedacht (photo 1922), CPUSA co-founder, answered questions about Sirola during a 1939 Dies Committee hearing Sirola was a representative of the Communist International to the US Communist Party from 1925 to 1927, replacing Sergey Ivanovich Gusev. While in America, Sirola used the pseudonym \\"Frank Miller.\\" In 1925 he was sent the United States as a representative of the Comintern to the Workers Party of America.Draper, Theodore, 1912-2006. American communism and Soviet Russia : the formative period New York, Viking Press, 1960. pp.140-1 On October 16, 1939, J.B. Matthews, chief investigator for the Dies Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, inquired into activities of Gusev (transliterated as \\"Gussev\\" in the transcript) in the U.S. during the 1920s with Max Bedacht, a co-founder of the Communist Party of the USA and long-time general secretary of the International Workers Order (IWO): > Mr. Matthews: Do you know a man by the name of Sirola? > Mr. Bedacht: Sirola I also met in the Comintern, I believe. > Mr. Matthews: Did you ever meet him here? > Mr. Bedacht: I knew him by that name before I met him. > Mr. Matthews. Did you ever meet him the United States? > Mr. Bedacht: No, I did not. > Mr. Matthews: You did not know him as a Comintern representative in the > United States? > Mr. Bedacht: No, I did not. Karelia In 1930, Sirola left his position as a functionary of the Comintern to become People's Commissar of Public Education in the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Karelia. Sirola also taught periodically in Leningrad at the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West in the department for Finns and Estonians and at the International Lenin School in Moscow. Yrj√∂ Sirola had begun researching Finnish folklore already in his youth. His longest article on the subject from the period was \\"Who were the heroes of the Kalevala?\\".Yrj√∂ Sirola: Ty√∂mies, 1914 Sirola continued researching the Kalevala in Soviet Karelia. On the initiative of Sirola, the Karelian Republic's Kantele Orchestra was formed.Erkki Salomaa: Yrj√∂ Sirola. Kustannusosakeyhti√∂ Savon Sana. Sirola was also interested in Kalevala and folk poetry of other countries also from the perspective of Marxist historical materialism and wrote about the topic in articles \\"A Small Sample of Edda\\" and \\"A Sample of Russian Folklore\\" Yrj√∂ Sirola: Rintama nro. 5, 1935. among others. Sirola made a speech at the 100th anniversary of the Kalevala in Petrozavodsk in 1935 and published a book Kalevala, the Cultural Heritage of Workers. Death Yrj√∂ Sirola died in Moscow of a stroke on November 18, 1936. He was 60 years old at the time of his death. In 1957 Sirola's ashes were returned to Finland and reburied in Malmi cemetery in Helsinki.

It tells the story of a girl, Vivian Smith, who is kidnapped while being evacuated from London during World War II and caught up in a struggle to preserve history. In this novel, Jones explains time travel with more reference to our current understanding of science than she does in many of her other works. Plot summary It is September 1939, the start of World War Two, and Vivian Smith is being evacuated. On arriving at the station, she is kidnapped by two boys, Jonathan and Sam, and taken to Time City, which exists outside of what we know as History. Most of the plot takes place in Time City, the purpose of which is to oversee the course of history and ensure that it stays on its \\"correct\\" path. To stop it straying from this path, the Time Police have Observers out in history, tweaking events to make sure that they go the right way. Jonathan and Sam have kidnapped Vivian because they (incorrectly) believe that she is the \\"Time Lady,\\" a legendary figure in Time City. The Time Lady is the consort of Faber John, another legendary figure. The legend states that at the end of history, Faber John and the Time Lady will return to Time City. Sam and Jonathan overheard the Chronologue, powerful authorities in Time City, talking about history going wrong and it being the fault of the Time Lady. They reasoned that, since she is Faber John's (in translation, John Smith's) wife, she must be calling herself Smith, and disguised as a young girl. Since Vivian fits these criteria, they had reasoned that she must be the Time Lady. Vivian manages to convince them that she is not the Time Lady. However, the boys cannot return her to her own time, since the repeated use of the time-locks would be picked up on by the Time Police and they would be found out. Vivian ends up staying with Jonathan's family, disguised as his cousin Vivian Lee. Jonathan and Sam are especially concerned about the disruptions in history because it may mean that Time City will also break apart. However, they learn from Vivian's tutor, Doctor Wilander, that there is another legend about Faber John. This one states that Faber John created four Caskets ‚Äì Gold, Silver, Iron and Lead ‚Äì which, after being placed out in history, provide the power needed to keep Time City running. They discover that the Caskets are hidden in what are known as the Unstable Eras ‚Äì eras of history in which events are not fixed and which might change at any moment. However, there are only three large Unstable Eras, so the fourth Casket must be hidden somewhere else. Undeterred, Jonathan, Vivian, Sam and the android Elio go in search of the Caskets, using an ancient time-travel device they find in a secret room beneath a museum. They discover that the Iron Casket, which was hidden in Vivian's time, had already been stolen, and it was this that was causing the disturbances in history. They see the so- called \\"Iron Guardian\\" as a ghost, in Time City, and talk to him. They realise that they will have to go back in time to stop the theft, and actually see the casket being stolen, but they are unable to catch the thief. They fare no better with the Gold Casket; they find it, and its Guardian, but the Guardian refuses to hand it over, saying that at midday on the final day of Time City, he will come to the Gnomon Tower and return it. Although they try to convince him that they urgently need it, he refuses to hand it over, and promptly vanishes. The Silver Casket is unfortunately hidden in the middle of the Mind Wars, but they still manage to find it, and the Silver Guardian, who, surprisingly, lets them have it. But, as it turns out, it is a fake, and the real Silver Casket had already been stolen, probably by the woman who posed as the Silver Guardian. On returning to Time City, they see that things have gone terribly wrong. Since the Silver Casket had gone, history has gone into convulsions, and nothing is as it was supposed to be, with World War II starting in 1937 and involving napalm and atom bombs from the start, and World War I melding into the Boer War. In a final attempt to catch the thieves, Jonathan, Vivian and Sam return to the station where they had kidnapped Vivian, and where they are sure the thief must be. This goes badly wrong when they fail to catch the thief, cause an accidental explosion of a train carrying radioactive fuel, and return to Time City with two hundred evacuees in tow. Because of this final disturbance of history, Time City has practically shut down. The Observers are being recalled from history, and this includes the real Vivian Lee and her family. But when they arrive, Vivian, Sam and Jonathan have a nasty surprise; the real Vivian Lee is the child thief that they saw stealing the Iron Casket, her mother is the false Silver Guardian, and her father is a man that they saw in the Age of Gold who tried to kill Jonathan. As Time City starts to fall to pieces around them, the Lees force Vivian, Sam and Jonathan to go to the Gnomon Tower with them as hostages. The trio realise the ancient time-travel device they found is in fact the Lead Casket, and Sam manages to escape from the clock tower to tell Elio, who returns with the city officials. When the clock struck twelve, the Gold Watcher appears at the steps of the Tower (with the Gold Casket, of course) and begins to climb the stairs. Hiding in a bush to prevent Vivian or Jonathan from being shot, Elio uses the Lead Casket to stop the Gold Watcher from reaching the top. This drained the Silver and Iron Caskets of \\"force\\", all of which went back into the Lead one. Dr. Wilander banishes Inga Lee, the daughter of an Icelandic emperor, to the earliest settlements of Iceland; Viv Lee to the last days of the \\"Depopulation of Earth\\". Vivan (Lee) is sent to Ancient China, but not before Dr. Wilander lets Vivian (Smith) shove the butter-pie she (VL) had been eating into her own eye, then inside her collar. The three Guardians, who Vivian notices are all exactly the same height as Dr. Wilander, bring the Caskets together with the Lead one, which Dr. Wilander is still holding, and they all blend together. Vivian realises he is in fact Faber John. The Time Lady, who as well as a horse she found in the Age of Gold, was the sleeping figure under Aeon Square Jonathan and Sam had showed Vivian, and also the woman who had cured Jonathan in the Age of Gold. Vivian, Sam, and Jonathan are put on trial for breaking the law. Mr. Donegal (Sam's father and Chief of Time Patrol) explains that they had pinpointed the source of a massive amount of chronons (which cause chaos and could harm the city) to September 1939 as Vivian Smith. The plan was to extract her from history and to a Fixed Era where the load could be neutralised. Jonathan and Elio tell the rest of the story. Jonathan and Sam's trials are postponed until Chronologue gets back together again and until he's older, respectively. The Time Lady tells Vivian that she would disturb every bit of history she comes in contact with, with the amount of chronons and temporons (which anyone from history has)... and her solution is to send Vivian out to the stars. A very lonely Vivian realises she truly is lost ‚Äì home was at war, and now had nowhere to go. The Walkers, Jonathan, and Elio all jump up and vouch for Vivian, saying they could all bear to live in the Stone Age as punishment for doing so. Faber John and the Time Lady relent; Time City has endured her so far and anyway, it could always be built back up again. They arrange for her parents to be brought to Time City as well. \\"Very well, he said to Vivian, \\"we can't do anything until the time locks open, but I'll tell you if it's possible when you come for your next lesson.\\" This, Vivian had not expected. \\"You're going to go on teaching me?\\" \\"I never give up on anything once I've started,\\" said Faber John. \\"Once I persuade you to use your brain, you might even be a good pupil. Come to me with Jonathan in three days time, in SELDOM END as usual.\\" References External links * Category:1987 British novels Category:1987 fantasy novels Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:Cultural depictions of Leonardo da Vinci Category:Methuen Publishing books Category:Novels by Diana Wynne Jones Category:Novels about time travel Category:British children's novels Category:1987 children's books ","title":"A Tale of Time City"},{"id":"2611552","text":"Sir Mungo Malagrowther is a fictional character in Walter Scott's 1822 The Fortunes of Nigel.

In 1679 he received the degree of doctor of laws, and in 1680 he moved again to Rome. The study of Vincenzo Filicaja and Niccol√≤ Leonico having convinced him that he and all his contemporaries were working in a wrong direction, he resolved to attempt a general reform. In 1690, in conjunction with fourteen others, he founded the celebrated Academy of Arcadians, and began the contest against false taste and its adherents. The academy was most successful; branch societies were opened in all the principal cities of Italy; and the influence of Giambattista Marino, opposed by the simplicity and elegance of such models as Angelo di Costanzo, soon died away. Crescimbeni officiated as secretary to the Arcadians for thirty-eight years. In 1705 he was made canon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin; in 1715 he obtained the chief curacy attached to the same church; and about two months before he died (1728) he was admitted a member of the order of Jesus. His principal work is the Istoria della volgar poesia (1698), an estimate of all the poets of Italy, past and contemporary, which may yet be consulted with advantage. The most important of his numerous other publications are the Commentarii (5 volumes, 1702‚Äì1711), and La Bellezza della volgar poezia (1700).

Homa u'migdal, lit. \\"wall and tower\\") was a settlement method used by Zionist settlers in Mandatory Palestine during the 1936‚Äì39 Arab Revolt. The establishment of new Jewish settlements was legally restricted by the Mandatory authorities, but the British generally gave their tacit accord to the Tower and Stockade actions as a means of countering the Arab revolt. During the course of the Tower and Stockade campaign, some 57 Jewish settlements including 52 kibbutzim and several moshavim were established throughout the country. The legal base was a Turkish Ottoman law that was in effect during the Mandate period, which stated that no illegal building may be demolished if the roof has been completed. Background 1938 model of Tower & Stockade During the Arab Revolt, these settlements provided safe havens on land that had been officially purchased by the KKL-JNF,Rotbard, Sharon. Wall and Tower - The Mold of Israeli Adrikalut. In: Territories, KW - Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin, 2003, p.162., protected Jewish populations, particularly in remote areas, on these Jewish-owned land and maintained \\"facts on the ground.\\" These settlements would eventually be transformed into fortified agricultural settlements, and served for security purposes (as defences against Arab raiders) as well as creating contiguous Jewish-populated regions, which would later help determine the borders of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. All of the major settlement groups (mostly kibbutzim and moshavim) took part in the campaign, which consisted of assembling a guard tower with a fence around it. While many of these settlements were not officially approved by the British Mandate authorities, existing settlements were not dismantled according to the Turkish Ottoman law still valid at the time. Due to the threat of immediate attack, at least as much as to any need of complying to the clauses of this law, the construction of the Tower and Stockade settlements had to be finished very quickly, usually in the course of a single day. What is less well known is the fact that the British authorities were rather lax at implementing restrictions against such Jewish activities at a time when their main security concern was the Arab revolt, thus wall and tower settlements were always created by day, not by night - against some still prevailing myths. In the very different political and security climate of the final months of the Mandate, a similar act of creating facts on the ground happened in April 1948 at Bror Hayil, when much of the work was indeed done during the night. The invention of the Wall and tower system is attributed to Shlomo Gur, founding member of Kibbutz Tel Amal (now Nir David), and was developed and encouraged by the architect Yohanan Ratner (see Russian-language article here ). The system was based on the fast construction of pre-fabricated wooden moulds, which would be filled with gravel and enclosed with barbed wire fencing. In average, the enclosed space formed a yard of 35 x 35 metres (1 dunam). Within this protected yard, the pre-fabricated wooden observation tower and the four sheds sheltering the initial 40 settlers were erected. The constructions were located within eyesight of neighbouring settlements and with accessibility for motor vehicles. 57 were constructed between the last days of 1936 and October 1939.Segal, Rafi & Weizman, Eyal (editors) (2003) A civilian occupation.

In 1591 he is known to have been living in Milan. True to the Counter-Reformation piety zealously expressed in Milanese art of his time, his paintings focus on mysteries and mystical episodes in saintly life. The crowded canvases and the angles recall Mannerism, but his paintings show an emotion that evokes common sentiments in Baroque art. Along with other artists, he completed a series of paintings (Quadroni of St. Charles) of the life of St. Charles Borromeo for the Duomo of Milan; an altarpiece with the Baptism of St. Augustine for San Marco, Milan; and a Mass of St. Gregory for the Basilica of San Vittore in Varese (1615‚Äì17). Also see the nightmarish, St. Gregory Delivers the Soul of a Monk (1617), also in San Vittore. He was a scholar of considerable attainments and held a position of dignity in Cerano.

In New Zealand the species is also known as kotare (from the MƒÅori ). It is called ‚Äúsacred‚Äù for it was said to be a holy bird for Polynesians, who believed it to have control over the waves. Likewise, the local subspecies of collared kingfisher and other kingfishers in the southwestern Pacific were ascribed venerable power over the ocean. Taxonomy The sacred kingfisher was described by the naturalists Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827 under the binomial name Halcyon sanctus. The title page is dated 1826. . Vigors and Horsfield compare their species to Alcedo sacra described by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788. Gmelin in turn based his description on John Latham's \\"Sacred King's Fisher\\" published in 1782. Latham described several varieties, one of which was illustrated in Arthur Phillip's The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay published in 1789. The genus Halcyon is now split and the sacred kingfisher placed in the genus Todiramphus that had been erected by the French surgeon and naturalist Ren√© Lesson in 1827. The generic name is derived from the genus Todus (Brisson, 1760), 'tody' (a West Indian insectivorous bird) and Ancient Greek rhamphos, 'bill'. The specific epithet is the Latin sanctus 'sacred'.

Both sexes are similar, but females are usually greener, duller and less buff beneath. Juveniles have buff or mottled brown edges on the collar, underparts and upper-wing coverts. Range and habitat Sacred kingfishers are found in Australia, New Zealand, Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, New Guinea, eastern Indonesia, much of northern and western Melanesia, and the Kermadec Islands. This species breeds throughout much of Australia (except the dry interior), New Zealand, New Caledonia and locally, New Guinea. Populations in the southern two-thirds of Australia migrate northwards at the end of the breeding season to New Guinea, east to the eastern Solomon Islands and west to Indonesia becoming uncommon to very sparse westwards to Sumatra. Birds move south again to Australia in August and September. It has also occurred as a vagrant on Christmas Island (in the Indian Ocean), Malaysia, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Nauru. A pair were spotted in Pampanga, Philippines in April / May 2016. In Australia, it occurs in open eucalypt forests, melaleuca swamps, mangroves, mudflats, wetlands and river or lake margins, farmland, parks and gardens.Pizzey, Graham and Doyle, Roy. (1980) A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. Collins Publishers, Sydney. In New Zealand, T. sanctus vagans shows altitudinal migration, with post- breeding movement from higher altitudes to the coast and also from forest to coast and open lands. Behaviour =Feeding= The sacred kingfisher feeds on a wide variety of invertebrates (particularly insects and spiders), small crustaceans, fish (infrequently), frogs, small rodents and reptiles, and there are a few reports of them eating finches and other small birds. Usually, the sacred kingfisher will sit on a low branch and wait for prey to pass by. It swoops down to grab the prey by briefly landing (sally-pounce) or hovering (sally-strike), and then returns to its perch to eat its catch by beating and swallowing. =Breeding= The breeding season is from August to March (mostly September to January), often with two broods. Once a pair of birds has mated, both members of the pair dig the nest; a burrow in a river bank, a hollow in a large branch or a termite mound are prime examples of nest location. The female lays a clutch of 3 to 6 glossy white, rounded eggs, measuring , which are incubated for 17-18 days by both parents (mainly female). Both parents (and possibly helpers) feed the nestlings for up to 4 weeks, and for a further 7-10 days after fledging. Conservation status The sacred kingfisher has a wide distribution and the population trend is increasing, and it is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

He was born in Georgetown, Ontario in 1841. His father came to Canada from County Antrim in Northern Ireland in 1822. His father and uncles had established a paper mill in the area after being involved in woollen milling since 1837. Barber became the manager in 1861. In 1876, with his brother James and John Fitzallen Ellis, he established Barber and Ellis, which would become one of the largest stationery manufacturers and suppliers in Canada. He took over operation of the mills in 1880. In 1881, he helped establish Toronto Paper Manufacturing Company Limited and set up a mill at Cornwall, Ontario. By 1883 this mill was producing newsprint and high quality paper. He visited Europe in 1886 to find alternatives to wood pulp from Quebec, and afterward in 1887 he set up a sulfite mill in Cornwall to supply high quality wood pulp to his plant and others. The only other paper product supplier in Canada in the 1870s was Alexander Buntin, which Barber saw as an opportunity to expand. In 1888, he upgraded the original paper mill on the Credit River to use hydroelectric power, believed to be the first industrial application of this technology in Canada. Besides his paper mills, he held high ranking positions in a number of other companies. He was president of many small companies such as Leadville Mining Company in Leadville, Colorado, Canadian Brass and Tube works in Toronto, and the Inter- Ocean Mining and Prospecting Company, also in Toronto. He also served in the militia and was reeve of Georgetown from 1867 to 1876 and in 1882. He saw active duty in 1866. He was elected as a Liberal to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1898. He lived in a grand mansion, Berwick Hall, which was designed by the architect E. J. Lennox He retired from business in 1912 following a heart attack the year before. He died in Georgetown in 1917.

Myhill isomorphism theorem  Sets A and B of natural numbers are said to be recursively isomorphic if there is a total computable bijection f from the set of natural numbers to itself such that f(A) = B. A set A of natural numbers is said to be one-one reducible to a set B if there is a total computable injection f on the natural numbers such that f(A) \\\\subseteq B and f(\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\setminus A) \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\setminus B. Myhill's isomorphism theorem states that two sets A and B of natural numbers are recursively isomorphic if and only if A is one-reducible to B and B is one-reducible to A. The theorem is reminiscent of the Schroeder‚ÄìBernstein theorem. The proof is different, however. The proof of Schroeder-Bernstein uses the inverses of the two injections, which is impossible in the setting of the Myhill theorem since these inverses might not be recursive. The proof of the Myhill theorem, on the other hand, defines the bijection inductively, which is impossible in the setting of Schroeder-Bernstein unless one uses the Axiom of Choice (which is not necessary for the proof). A corollary of Myhill's theorem is that two total numberings are one-equivalent if and only if they are computably isomorphic.

Williams had previously been a co-host of The Daily Edition and a long-time presenter for the Seven Sport team. Career Williams graduated from the Jesuit St Aloysius' College and worked as a construction worker, model and competed in surf lifesaving championships. One of Tom's first appearances on television was in the video clip of Melissa Tkautz's debut song \\"Read My Lips\\". The turning point in Williams' life occurred in 2000, when he phoned into a radio show hosted by comic duo Merrick & Rosso. His style interested them so much that he was given a regular segment on the show, which eventually led to an on-air role as a builder on the Seven Network renovation show Room for Improvement. This was followed by a stint as a presenter on long-running travel show The Great Outdoors in mid-2001. Williams would go on to host, present or participate in a number of programs during the 2000s for Seven. Williams appeared on a celebrity special of The Weakest Link in which he was voted off in the first round. In 2005, Williams hosted the fifth season of The Mole ‚Äì The Amazing Game; however some fans called for the return of former host, Grant Bowler. With the new series, Tom brought the concept of live eliminations, from the Seven Network's Martin Place studios in Sydney. In 2005, Williams was one of several Seven Network celebrities who starred in Dancing with the Stars. In the show's finale, Tom danced shirtless with partner Kym Johnson and he was voted the winner. During his time at The Great Outdoors and over the course of the series Williams emerged as sex symbol.http://www.hottestontv.com.au/index.php?section=celebs&profile;=383&letter;=T&sort;=firstname He joined Seven Sport in 2008 as a roving reporter for the Beijing Olympics and would continue in this role to date, showcasing the colour and features at other network events including the Australian Open. In April 2009, Williams relieved as sport presenter on Nova 969 during Merrick & Rosso with Kate Ritchie, whilst Marto was having surgery. In 2010, Tom co-hosted Australia's Greatest Athlete with Mark Beretta on the Seven Network and also co-hosted No Leave, No Life with Rachel Finch. In March 2011, Williams joined Classic Rock FM presenting Saturday mornings with Kate Mac. In June 2013, Williams was announced as co-host of a new afternoon entertainment program, The Daily Edition alongside Sally Obermeder, Kris Smith and Monique Wright. In December 2018, Williams announced his resignation from the Seven Network. He switched careers to real estate in 2019. After six months at LJ Hooker Avenue, Williams quit the Mosman estate agency. In 2020, Wiliams appeared in the sixth season of the Australian version of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. In June, Williams briefly returned to the Seven Network to present the final three episodes of The Daily Edition following Ryan Phelan's dismissal from the network. Tom has also been a regular contributor to entertainment and lifestyle website Live4 since 2012. Personal life In February 2012, Williams announced his engagement to fashion designer Rachel Gilbert. In July 2013, Tom announced on The Daily Edition that his wife Rachel is pregnant with their first child. On 8 January 2014, Rachel gave birth to daughter Storm.

Myhill Sr. (11 August 1923 ‚Äì 15 February 1987)Revue philosophique de Louvain, Volume 85, 1987, p. 603. was a British mathematician. Education Myhill received his Ph.D. from Harvard University under Willard Van Orman Quine in 1949.. He was professor at SUNY Buffalo from 1966 until his death in 1987. He also taught at several other universities. His son, also called John Myhill, is a professor of linguistics in the English department of the University of Haifa in Israel. Contributions In the theory of formal languages, the Myhill‚ÄìNerode theorem, proven by Myhill with Anil Nerode, characterizes the regular languages as the languages that have only finitely many inequivalent prefixes. In computability theory, the Rice‚ÄìMyhill‚ÄìShapiro theorem, more commonly known as Rice's theorem, states that, for any nontrivial property P of partial functions, it is undecidable to determine whether a given Turing machine computes a function with property P. The Myhill isomorphism theorem is a computability-theoretic analogue of the Cantor‚ÄìBernstein‚ÄìSchroeder theorem that characterizes the recursive isomorphisms of pairs of sets. In the theory of cellular automata, Myhill is known for proving (along with E. F. Moore) the Garden of Eden theorem, stating that a cellular automaton has a configuration with no predecessor if and only if it has two different asymptotic configurations which evolve to the same configuration. He is also known for posing the firing squad synchronization problem of designing an automaton that, starting from a single non-quiescent cell, evolves to a configuration in which all cells reach the same non- quiescent state at the same time; this problem was again solved by Moore. In constructive set theory, Myhill is known for proposing an axiom system that avoids the axiom of choice and the law of the excluded middle, known as intuitionistic Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel. He also developed a constructive set theory based on natural numbers, functions, and sets, rather than (as in many other foundational theories) basing it purely on sets. The Russell‚ÄìMyhill paradox or Russell‚ÄìMyhill antinomy, discovered by Bertrand Russell in 1902 (and discussed in his The Principles of Mathematics, 1903) \\"The reason is that in Appendix B Russell also presents another paradox which he thinks cannot be resolved by means of the simple theory of types.\\" and rediscovered by Myhill in 1958,\\"Problems Arising in the Formalization of Intensional Logic.\\" Logique et Analyse 1 (1958): 78‚Äì83 concerns systems of logic in which logical propositions can be members of classes, and can also be about classes; for instance, a proposition P can \\"state the product\\" of a class C, meaning that proposition P asserts that all propositions contained in class C are true. In such a system, the class of propositions that state the product of classes that do not include them is paradoxical. For, if proposition P states the product of this class, an inconsistency arises regardless of whether P does or does not belong to the class it describes. In music theory, Myhill's property is a mathematical property of musical scales described by John Clough and Gerald Myerson and named by them after Myhill.

As the names suggests, it is a high kick intended to send the ball relatively straight up so players can get under it before it comes down (see hang time). Rugby league The execution of a bomb in rugby league involves putting up a high kick in general play. The ball often does not travel very far forward, giving the attacking team time to run ahead to where it is expected to land, providing the possibility of re-gaining possession amongst an un-set defensive line. Bombs are often used when close to the try-line, so that the attacking team's best jumpers have a chance to leap for the ball and come down with it in the in-goal area. The result is a towering ball which should rotate end on end. The height of the kick makes the ball susceptible to wind which causes the ball to change direction. Also, the ball gathers speed as it falls closer to the ground and this combined with the swirling can also cause the ball to change direction, making it difficult for the opposition to take the ball cleanly. In Australian rugby league, the bomb was popularised by Easts' and Parramatta's John \\"Bomber\\" Peard in the 1970s. However, by the 1980s, it became increasingly seen as a negative or unexciting tactic, and a rule change was made to lessen its effect: A bomb (or any type of kick) caught on the full in the in-goal area by the defending side now resulted in an automatic 20 metre tap restart, sometimes colloquially known as defusing the bomb. Grubber kicks or cross kicks are now often used in preference to bombing into the in-goal area. In the 1970s the phrase \\"up and under\\" became associated with Rugby League in Britain, when it became the catchphrase of Eddie Waring,Eric Partridge, Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor.The concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional, Routledge, 2007, , p. 677 an English rugby league coach, commentator and television presenter.Dave Russell. Looking north: northern England and the national imagination, Manchester University Press, 2004, , . p. 260 In recent times the \\"Up and Under\\" was mastered by Bobbie Goulding helping St. Helens to the inaugural Super League title, and several others after that. It was a common feature of the Saints and though it suffered criticism for its 'negative' quality (at the same time rugby union was under similar scrutiny for turning into a 'kicking' game) it was an extremely effective tactic. The risky nature of the ball (for the catcher) and the opportunity for the pursuing players to challenge for it made it an often comical, and controversial move particularly in the case of defensive players 'chickening out' under pressure. Being able to secure bombs is a sought after quality in fullbacks and wingers. Rugby union In rugby union, the term 'bomb' is rarely used, with 'up and under', 'box-kick', or Garryowen (after the Garryowen Football Club that popularised the tactic) preferred. It allows the attacking team to disrupt the defensive line, take the defence's pressure off themselves and put offensive pressure on their opponents. However, the kicking team risks losing possession of the ball, after which the opposing team may counterattack. In rugby union, the opposing team may choose to call for a mark if the ball is behind the opposition's 22 metre line and caught cleanly. Australian rules football Due to the requirement of kicks to travel more than 15 metres before a mark can be awarded, high short kicks are rarely deliberately used in Australian rules football. When they are used they are generally known as up and unders. The term bomb, however, is commonly used to describe a very long kick, especially one designed to just gain field position, not as a pass to a specific player. Gridiron The bomb kick is legal in Canadian football, under the condition that the person trying to recover the kick start behind or at the same yard line as the kicker. It was also legal in arena football, where rebound nets reduced the required angle needed for the kick to be effective; in arena football, the ball had to be kicked from the ground or through a drop kick, as punts were not legal. Bomb kicks are not generally legal in American football, where players are not allowed to recover their own team's kicks on scrimmage plays past their own line of scrimmage. A bomb kick that does not cross the line of scrimmage can, however, be recovered by any player on the offensive team, regardless of whether it is by Canadian or American rules or whether the player was ahead of or behind the kicker. Even in gridiron codes where it is legal, the bomb kick is rarely encountered. The forward pass in those codes fulfills the purpose of the bomb kick more reliably and with less risk to the offensive team. The standard punt formation has all other players ahead of the punter (and thus not eligible to recover a bomb kick) to provide protection.

It consisted of a procession in which the chief figure was a boy of good family and noble appearance, whose father and mother must be alive. With young participants, the Daphnephoria was able to combine components together, which signified an important stage or rite of passage. Immediately in front of this boy, who was called Daphnephoros (laurel bearer), walked one of his nearest relatives, carrying an olive branch hung with laurel and flowers and having on the upper end a bronze ball from which hung several smaller balls. Another smaller ball was placed on the middle of the branch or pole (which was called a Œ∫œéœÄœâ), which was then twined round with purple ribbons, and at the lower end with saffron ribbons. These balls were said to indicate the sun, stars and moon, while the ribbons referred to the days of the year, being 365 in number. The Daphnephoros, wearing a golden crown, or a wreath of laurel, richly dressed and partly holding the pole, was followed by a chorus of maidens carrying suppliant branches and singing a hymn to the god. The Daphnephoros dedicated a bronze tripod in the temple of Apollo, and Pausanias (ix. 10.4) mentions the tripod dedicated there by Amphitryon when his son Heracles had been Daphnephoros.

History =1984 launch= Art & Antiques launched its premier issue in March 1984. While the magazine disclaimed any connection to a previous publication of the same name, the company had in fact bought the rights from a previous magazine produced in the late 1970s and early 1980s. That magazine began as American Art & Antiques, later shortening its name to simply Art & Antiques. The new Art & Antiques was founded and published by Wick Allison, who had previously founded D Magazine, a city magazine devoted to Dallas, Texas. A major investor in Allison's magazine was an insurance company, the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, which viewed the magazine as a prestigious publication and an asset to the firm's reputation. The magazine's founding editor was Isolde Motley, former editor of Art+Auction, who went on to join Martha Stewart's publishing empire. Motley later served corporate editor at Time Inc. Jeff Schaire became the next editor of Art & Antiques in 1986. Initially Art & Antiques was an oversized publication. The publishers switched to a standard format due to the high publishing and shipping costs. =Early publicity= Under editor Jeff Schaire, Art & Antiques published two stories that earned a great deal of publicity in the mainstream media. One of these was contributed by artist and computer technician Lillian F. Schwartz, to the January 1987 issue, whether or not the Mona Lisa was actually a depiction of its artist Leonardo da Vinci and purported to produce scientific evidence that it in fact was. But the story that produced a firestorm of publicity and was immediately picked up by Time and Newsweek dealt with the Helga paintings by Andrew Wyeth, which became a huge news story both because of the scandalous implication that the subject might be the artist's mistress and also because of the general belief that Wyeth had been producing over the course of many years a large body of as-yet- unknown masterpieces. =1980s-1990s= In the early 1990s, Allison brought in Michael Pashby to take over duties as publisher. Pashby had previous done extensive work with Meredith Publications. Today he is the Executive Vice President/General Manager of Magazine Publishers of America, a trade organization. Under Allison, the magazine was based at the Simon Dezer Building, 87-89 Fifth Avenue. The historic structure, on lower Fifth Avenue, was built in the early 1900s. Under the owner who bought it from Allison, Art & Antiques moved for a period to an Art Deco skyscraper on Third Avenue. The character of the magazine was largely shaped by founding editor Isolde Motley and later Jeffrey Schaire, who attempted to bring to the magazine a mixture of high art and popular culture, with articles not just on major artists, but also on pinball machines and inexpensive collectibles, items more accessible for a wider audience. The magazine's prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s was reflected in a 1991 case of theft at the Macklowe Gallery, a dealer in Tiffany lamps, jewelry, and antiques, especially items in the art nouveau style. At the close of the business day, a robber was able to gain access to the gallery on upper Madison Avenue simply by claiming to be a bike messenger with a parcel from Art & Antiques and was able to abscond with about $80,000.00 worth of jewelry. In fact, the magazine did not have any relationship with the gallery at that time. In his contemporary commentary on the period, the writer Tom Wolfe saw Art & Antiques and other publications as part of what he called a \\"plutographic\\" movement. The Spring, 1989, issue of the Grinnell Magazine, a publication of Grinnell College, transcribed a speech Wolfe had given at the school in which he said the following: > Pornography is the graphic depiction of the acts of prostitutes. Plutography > is the graphic depiction of the acts of the rich. Why else do you think > people subscribe to magazines like House and Garden, Architectural Digest, > Town and Country, Connoisseur, Art and Antiques? Suppose that you are being > given tips about design, connoisseurship and all these things; obviously > it's really just so that you can look plutographically at the lives of the > rich.

Other magazines owned by CurtCo Media include San Diego Magazine, Robb Report, Sarasota, and Gulfshore Life. CurtCo sold off most of its magazines, including Art & Antiques, in 2010. =2010 to Present= Phillip Troy Linger, former publisher of Los Angeles-based Brentwood Magazine, purchased Art & Antiques magazine in April 2010. Special Issues =100 Top Collectors= Under founding editor Jeffrey Schaire, Art & Antiques began a tradition of publishing an annual issue devoted to the \\"100 Top Collectors.\\" This was one of the first compendiums of its kind, although similar articles had appeared in Connoisseur under editor Thomas Hoving, and would later appear in Art+Auction and other art-world publications. The annual issue was both famous and infamous in the art world. Schaire did not simply choose major collectors, but tried to focus on both those rich people who had done a lot in the last year, as well as smaller collectors who, although not of immense wealth, brought an interesting focus to their collecting, specializing in off- beat art, antiques, and collectibles. Writers Notable writers have included Hilton Kramer, former art critic for The New York Times, and authors such as John Updike, Fran√ßoise Gilot, and Hugh Kenner. In the 1980s and early 1990s, editor Jeffrey Schaire strived to bring in notable authors, in the hope that the magazine would be unpretentious and interesting for a general audience. In the same spirit, Schaire tried to bring in celebrity authors to bring in their own thoughts and remembrances of art-related subjects. These authors included notables such as the actress Helen Hayes.

It is charged with selecting the United States Olympic Swimming team and any other teams which officially represent the United States, as well as the overall organization and operation of the sport within the country, in accordance with the Amateur Sports Act. The national headquarters of USA Swimming is located at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\\"About USA Swimming\\", USA Swimming. History USA Swimming was originally called United States Swimming (USS) upon its departure from the AAU. Thus, there are several terms used to describe the organization at different times. These terms are: USA Swimming, USA-S, United States Swimming, USS, and US Swimming. Prior to the existence of \\"USS\\", the AAU, or the Amateur Athletic Union, served as the governing body for swimming and other sports across the country.\\"USA Swimming History\\", USA Swimming. =Amateur Athletic Union= The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) was the official organization responsible for the running of all amateur sports in the United States, established in 1888. The AAU was officially charged with the organization and operation of many sports in the US. During this time, swimming was one of the committees in the organization and was not an independent governing body.\\"About AAU\\", AAU USA The Amateur Sports Act of 1978 enabled the governance of sports in the US by organizations other than the AAU. This act made each sport set up its own National governing body (NGB). Each of these governing bodies would be part of the United States Olympic Committee, but would not be run by the Committee. Thus, United States Swimming was born. From 1978 to 1980, the official responsibilities of governing the sport were transferred from the AAU Swimming Committee to the new United States Swimming. Bill Lippman, the last head of the Swimming Committee, and Ross Wales, the first president of United States Swimming, worked together to ease the transition. This process was made more interesting because the United States boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics and, during this time, the leadership of the sport was in flux. The AAU still holds several aquatic events, but it is no longer the official governing body of the sport.AAU Swimming =Presidents= * Bill Lippman ‚Äì Last Head of swimming committee in the AAU * Ross Wales (1980‚Äì1984) ‚Äì First true president of USA Swimming * Sandra Baldwin (1984‚Äì1986) * Carol Zaleski (1986‚Äì1990, 1994‚Äì1998) * Bill Maxson (1990‚Äì1994) * Dale Neuburger (1998‚Äì2002) * Ron Van Pool (2002‚Äì2006) * Jim Wood (2006‚Äì2010) * Bruce Stratton (2010‚Äì2014) * Jim Sheehan (2014‚Äì2018) * Bob Vincent (2018-present) =Chief Executives= * Ray Essick (1980‚Äì1997) * Chuck Wielgus (1997‚Äì2017) * Tim Hinchey (2017‚Äìpresent) Location When it was part of the AAU to 1981, USA Swimming had its headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1981, USA Swimming moved to its present-day location in Colorado Springs. At the time of the 1981 move, it had four staff members. In 1997, work was completed on the official USA Swimming Headquarters, which is currently the official home of USA Swimming. Through the national headquarters, the organization provides various programs and services to its members, supporters, affiliates and the interested public. This includes educational programs, fund-raising activities, general information, publications, resources, and sports medicine programs, all relating to the sport of swimming. Organizational structure There are several parts and levels that make up USA Swimming. There is the National governing body (national) level, the Zone (regional) level, and the Local Swimming Committee (local/state) level. =Safe Sport= USA Swimming's Safe Sport program, established by USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus, is designed raise awareness and reduce the risk and help prevent athletes from being sexually abused. The program includes mandatory training, background checks and an overall awareness of warning signs. USA Swimming requires free, mandatory training for members and volunteers who work with athletes, as well as provides free training for athletes and parents to further protect swimmers from abuse. To date, USA Swimming has banned more than 100 coaches for violating USA Swimming's detailed Code of Conduct. USA Swimming encourages any swimmers or parents who suspect any abuse or inappropriate behavior to come forward by either contacting the Athlete Protection Officer or logging a complaint of sexual misconduct or abuse relating to USA Swimming through its online reporting system. The complaint process involves USA Swimming working with a third-party investigator to effectively and thoroughly investigate all complaints of abuse. =The National governing body= The National governing body (NGB) of United States Swimming is an extension of the United States Olympic Committee. While all of the separate swim teams, LSC's, and Zones do not officially make up the NGB, they are all members and are subject to the laws of the NGB. The NGB is made up of both staff members of USA Swimming and volunteer members of the board. The office of the President is the head of the board and is responsible for the overall direction of USA Swimming. The chief executive is the head of the staff located at the national headquarters in Colorado Springs at the Olympic Training Center. The chief executive is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the organization at the national level. The NGB is responsible for nearly all aspects of USA Swimming, and swimming in the United States in general. Its most important responsibility is to set the rules for the sport in the United States. These rules are guided by the international governing body for aquatic sports (FINA). FINA makes the rules that are to be followed at all international level meets. USA Swimming follows accordingly to make the rules of USA Swimming match the rules of FINA; however, it does not have to. In theory, an NGB could make its rules whatever it wanted and have all national level meets and below follow those rules, but it would not have jurisdiction over international level meets held within the borders of the United States, and such a meet would have to follow FINA rules. =The Local Swimming Committee= The Local Swimming Committee (LSC) is the local level of USA Swimming. Each LSC is a separate entity, with each being an individual member of USA Swimming, although all act on behalf of USA Swimming on the local level. LSCs are the local administrative organization responsible for the registration, support and governance of the USA Swimming member swim clubs in their designated region. Over 2800 swim clubs across the US are registered with USA Swimming through their respective LSCs.\\"Governance & LSCs\\" USA Swimming\\"Starting a Club\\" USA Swimming The LSC gives USA Swimming sanctions to swimming meets in their area. A sanction from the LSC allows the meet to be run under USA Swimming rules. The LSC is responsible for enforcing these rules at the meet. The LSC does this by training officials for the meet. These officials are typically parents of swimmers and volunteers. The technical swimming rules for USA Swimming are the same for all LSCs as mandated by USA Swimming. This allows an official in one LSC to officiate in another LSC without having to learn a new set of rules. This is able to be done because while each LSC may have its own set of rules they are not different regarding the actual strokes. An LSC is typically responsible for an entire state; however, several bigger states (e.g. California, Texas, Pennsylvania, among others) have multiple LSCs within their boundaries. The size of the LSCs is supposed to be roughly the same and allow for easier travel between meets. The result is that while borders tend to follow state borders, this is not a rule. There are currently 59 LSCs in the country.mapped here Meets There are several different types and levels of meets, all but the very top level directed by individual clubs and the Local Swimming Committee. The following is a list of the types of meets, listed from lowest and most common level to highest and least common level. =Dual Meet, Double Dual, Triangular, Quadrangular, etc.= A dual meet is a meet where each individual event is ranked based on how individual swimmers on a team swim. It is generally limited to 2 teams, but different variations can have more. In a dual meet, there is almost always a limit to the number of events that a certain person can swim, usually four, and to the number of swimmers that a certain team can enter. meet entries close up when the maximum number of people have entered. Generally, there is only 1 heat in each event and each team alternates lanes so that each team swims in half the pool, regardless of how fast each swimmer is. While this style of meet is generally uncommon for individual USA Swimming clubs, it is by far the most common of high school (NFHS) swimming, YMCA swimming, college (NCAA) swimming, and summer league swimming. Meets of this variety are almost always a low level meet because entry time standards are almost never applied to enter the meet. It can, however, be rather high level when both teams involved are very fast and have exclusively high level swimmers, as is the case with college swimming. =Invitational Meet= An invitational meet is a meet with many more teams and swimmers than a dual meet. The term \\"Invitational\\" comes from the fact that for a team to attend this type of meet, a team had to be invited to attend from the host team, but now is a general catch-all term for this style of meet (although there are still occasional invitation-only meets.) Meets of this variety generally have hundreds of swimmers, many teams, and many different events. Within the definition of an invitational meet, there are dozens of different styles of scoring and placing but the standard method is described here. All levels of swimming use invitational style meets at least once during their season (usually as a championship meet of all the clubs in a league), but the clubs of USA Swimming use this meet almost exclusively since there are very few leagues in USA Swimming and it acts as one giant league itself. Most meets of this style have no limits as to the number of swimmers that a team can enter, and only limit the number of times a swimmer can swim in order to make the flow of the meet manageable. Meets of this style can be at any level of swimming since all of the higher level meets use this style of meet with just more restrictive rules applied. Meets of this style usually do not have entry time standards, but can have them to either reduce the size of the meet, or raise the competition level. =LSC Championships= Each Local Swimming Committee (LSC) is mandated to have a season ending championships twice a year for both Age Group (younger) and Senior (no age requirement) swimmers. Most LSC's split these up into two separate meets. The meet style is an invitational meet open only to club teams within the LSC. Almost universally, entry time standards are applied so that only the top level swimmer of the LSC can attend; only a few of the smaller LSCs do not have a time standard. Each LSC sets their own time standards (due to LSC size differences), so the competition level of the meet is not exactly the same across the country. Normally, this style meet is a prelim/final format. Common age groups are 10 and under, 11-12, 13-14, 15 and over, also known as seniors. =Zone/Sectional Championship= As stated before, there are four zones and 59 LSCs in the country. While the LSC championship is a high level meet, the Zone/Sectional Championships are even higher. These meets are also of the invitational format, but the entry time standards are even higher so that only the fastest swimmers of Zones qualify. Zone and Sectional meets are of the same competition level, but serve different purposes. Zone meets are for age group swimmers and Sectional meets are for Senior swimmers. While the intention is to have one champion for the whole Zone, this is generally not possible because to have a meet of that high of a competition level, there would be very little difference between this level and the next level, so the entry times can only be made so fast. Thus, there are sometimes too many swimmers qualifying for this meet to have only a single meet in a Zone. Currently, the Central States Zone is the only one that has more than one Zone Championship meet (Age Group swimmers), and all four zones have multiple Sectional Championships (Senior swimmers). After Zone meets for age group swimmers some may qualify for Junior Nationals. = Arena Pro Swim Series = The Arena Pro Swim Series (PSS), formally known as the Speedo Grand Prix, is a series of 7 meets held throughout the season. Held in either Short Course Yards (SCY) or long Course Meters (LCM). Swimmers race in both Olympic and non-Olympic distances, but only receive points for Olympic distances. First place receives 5 points and $1,000. Second place receives 3 points and $600. Third place receives 1 point and $200. The swimmer that accumulates the most points by the end of the series, wins a $10,000 bonus. Any swimmer of any nationality can compete in the PSS but are not eligible to some of the prizes. =National Championship/US Open= There is only 1 National Championship meet at the conclusion of each season across the country. The National Championships are also of the invitational meet format and offer extremely high level competition. Only a very small percentage of people who ever swim will make it to this high a level of competition. This meet is generally used to determine the US National Team for various international level meets each year, but is not used to determine the US Olympic Team. Currently, there are 2 National Championships each year, but the Spring Championships have traditionally been of a significantly lower level of competition than the Summer Championships. This is because the Spring Championships are so close to NCAA Championships and the fact that Spring Championships are rarely used as a selection meet for national teams. In many other sports, the National Championship of the sport is known as the \\"US Open\\" and while swimming did have a very high national level meet by that name each year, it was just a high level meet and not a national championship meet. This specific meet was ended in 2006 and was replaced with a reformulated Spring/Winter National Championship. Since there is no \\"US Open\\" meet of the old format, the National Championships (specifically Summer '08) have begun to be called the \\"US Open\\" to bring it in line with the nomenclature of other sports. =US Olympic Trials= The Olympic Trials are held once every 4 years. Since this meet offers such a coveted prize (a spot on the US Olympic Team) it never fails to attract the absolute fastest in the sport of swimming in the United States. Because of this, the entry time standards are even faster than the National Championships. However, even though this is a faster meet and would actually offer a truer indication of who is the fastest swimmer in the United States, the winner of each event in this meet is not officially considered a National Champion and this meet is NOT held in place of the National Championships every 4 years (although the Nationals are generally not held when the Olympic Trials occur, or other selection trials). However, for 2008, the winners of the Olympic Trials were indeed officially be a National Champion with the trials meet taking the place of the National Championship meet for 2008. It is unclear if this will continue for future trials. Unlike all other US Swimming meets, United States citizenship is required to compete at this meet since only United States citizens are allowed to represent the United States at the Olympics. The Olympic Trials are also under unique requirements made by the USOC. Trials meets are also held for the World Championships, Pan American Games and World University Games, typically at a national championship meet.

In the United States, twenty states, the federal government, and the District of Columbia have a version of these commitment laws, which are referred to as \\"Sexually Violent Predator\\" (SVP) or \\"Sexually Dangerous Persons\\" laws. Generally speaking, SVP laws have three elements: (1) That the person has been convicted of a sexually violent offense (a term that is defined applicable statutes) (2) That the person suffers from a mental abnormality and/or personality disorder, which causes him/her serious difficulty controlling his/her sexually violent behavior. (3) That this mental abnormality and/or personality disorder makes the person likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility. A \\"mental abnormality\\" is a legal term that is not identical to a mental disorder, though experts generally refer to diagnoses contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) as evidence of a mental abnormality. In most cases, commitment as an SVP is indefinite; however, once a person is committed, the confining agency is constitutionally required to conduct periodic reviews of that person's mental condition. If the committed person's condition changes so he/she no longer meets commitment criteria, he/she must be released. In some circumstances, committed persons can be released to court-monitored conditional releases to less restrictive alternative placements (LRAs).RCW 71.09.090 History In 1990, the first SVP law was established in the state of Washington, following two high-profile sexual assaults and murders by Earl Kenneth Shriner and Gene Kane. In response to the attacks, Helen Harlow‚Äîthe mother of Gene Kane's victim‚Äîformed a group known as The Tennis Shoe Brigade in order to pressure the state government to change the laws related to sex offenders. Washington Governor Booth Gardner formed the \\"Task Force on Community Protection\\" to consider possible solutions. While the Task Force deliberated, serial killer Westley Allan Dodd kidnapped, raped, and murdered three young boys in Vancouver, Washington, for which he was executed by hanging. The state legislature, following the recommendation of the Task Force, enacted the \\"Community Protection Act of 1990.\\" The United States Supreme Court declared the \\"civil commitment\\" of former sex offenders was \\"civil\\" and non-punitive as the high court's justices presumed as true the state's empirical claim that it had a means of identifying a class of individuals, labeled by the state \\"sexually violent predators\\", who were \\"extremely dangerous\\" due to their \\"likelihood of engaging in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence [being] high\\" (Kansas v. Hendricks (1997) 521 U.S. 346, 351). In order for the imprisoning of these individuals, without new crimes having been committed, the U.S. Supreme court indicated that states must be able to make a distinction, between (i) the class of sex offenders who must be released after having completed their prison sentences and (ii) those who could be \\"civilly\\" detained, as this later class (unlike the former) is made up of individuals who suffered from \\"mental abnormalities\\" which caused them to have \\"serious difficulty in controlling behavior\\", thus making them distinguishable \\"from the dangerous but typical recidivist\\" that must be released (Kansas v. Crane (2002) 534 U.S. 407, 413). Data culled over the several years these schemes have been in place have systematically demonstrated that \\"Sexually Violent Predator\\" laws were imprisoning individuals who had not been rationally differentiated from typical recidivists or from individuals who were among the overwhelming majority of former sex offenders who would not ever reoffend. (\\"Do Sexually Violent Predator Laws Violate Double Jeopardy or Substantive Due Process? An Empirical Inquiry\\", Prof. Tama Rice Lave, Brooklyn Law Review, 2013) One federal court judge surmised in 2015 that Minnesota's Sexually Violent Predator law seemed to be one not directed at any legitimate governmental purpose; rather it seemed to be designed to punish a politically unpopular class of individuals not constitutionally subject to punishment (Karsjens, et al. v. Minnesota Department of Human Services, et al., United States District Court, District of Minnesota, Case No. 11-3659 (DFW/JJK))? As of 2010, 20 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws similar to Washington's. The Federal Government established its sex offender commitment process when it passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act.Jesse J. Holland, Court: Sexually dangerous can be kept in prison, Associated Press. Retrieved 5-16-2010. Civil confinement Civil confinement is the formal legal process by which persons convicted of certain sexual offenses (generally violent sex offenders) may be subject to involuntary commitment upon completion of a prison sentence, and is a potential penalty of sexually violent predator laws. =Process= Although the exact details of the legal process may vary from state to state, the United States Supreme Court reviewed and upheld as constitutional a statutory process adopted in Kansas. See Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997). There, civil confinement proceedings could be initiated against \\"any person who has been convicted of or charged with a sexually violent offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in the predatory acts of sexual violence.\\" Many of those terms were themselves defined in the statute, including \\"mental abnormality,\\" defined as \\"congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses in a degree constituting such person a menace to the health and safety of others.\\" Id. If a prison identified an inmate who was about to be released but potentially fit this definition, the prison authorities were required to notify the local prosecutor of the impending release. The prosecutor was then required to decide whether to petition for commitment. The court would then have to determine whether probable cause existed to support the inmate's status as a \\"sexually violent predator,\\" and, upon such a determination, order the inmate to be psychologically evaluated. The psychological evaluation would then form the basis of a further trial to determine whether the inmate qualified as a violent sexual predator. Upon such a determination, the inmate would be subject to involuntary commitment at a medical facility until such time as his mental abnormality had changed and it was safe to release him. Id. at 353. The court would then be required to conduct an annual review of the determination, and the inmate would always be allowed to petition for freedom under the same standards. The Supreme Court concluded that this process met previously established standards of constitutional substantive due process governing voluntary confinement, did not constitute double jeopardy because the proceedings were civil rather than criminal, and was not an ex post facto law for the same reason. Id. at 353-371. In a following case, the United States Supreme Court clarified that the government must demonstrate that the inmate has at least a serious lack of ability to control his behavior. Kansas v. Crane 534 U.S. 407 (2002). The Supreme Court has also determined that Congress has the authority to pass a similar law affecting federal prisoners. United States v. Comstock, 560 U.S. 126 (2010). Twenty states have civil commitment facilities, as of 2018.  Controversy  As with civil commitment generally, civil confinement is a controversial implementation of state power. Detractors point to the prospect of indefinite detention without due process of law.E.g., David Rosen, \\"Sex Offenders, Civil Confinement and the Resurrection of Evil: The New Disappeared,\\" May 10, 2007, Counterpunch (\\"Civil confinement permits the state to transform a criminal sentence with a specified duration into an indeterminate life sentence.\\") Accessed January 24, 2008; Mark K. Matthews, \\"Molesters confined even after jail time is up\\" State Line (\\"When the most dangerous sexual predators are due to leave prison ... officials can revoke their freedom and toss them into mental hospitals indefinitely.\\") Accessed January 24, 2008. Proponents cite public safety.E.g., Don Esmonde, \\"No mercy due 100-year-old pedophile,\\" December 13, 2009, The Buffalo News. Accessed December 26, 2009. State legislatures who have decided to adopt civil confinement statutes have expressed the intent of the laws in their enactments. One example is the State of Washington, which explained: :The legislature finds that a small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators exist who do not have a mental disease or defect that renders them appropriate for the existing involuntary treatment act . . . which is intended to be a short-term civil commitment system that is primarily designed to provide short-term treatment to individuals with serious mental disorders and then return them to the community. In contrast to persons appropriate for civil commitment . . . sexually violent predators generally have personality disorders and/or mental abnormalities which are unamenable to existing mental illness treatment modalities and those conditions render them likely to engage in sexually violent behavior. The legislature further finds that sex offenders' likelihood of engaging in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence is high. The existing involuntary commitment act . . . is inadequate to address the risk to reoffend because during confinement these offenders do not have access to potential victims and therefore they will not engage in an overt act during confinement as required by the involuntary treatment act for continued confinement. The legislature further finds that the prognosis for curing sexually violent offenders is poor, the treatment needs of this population are very long term, and the treatment modalities for this population are very different than the traditional treatment modalities for people appropriate for commitment under the involuntary treatment act.RCW 70.09.010. Legal challenges In 1997, The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of SVP laws in Kansas v. Hendricks. In doing so, the United States Supreme Court declared the \\"civil commitment\\" of former sex offenders was \\"civil\\" and non-punitive as the High Court's justices presumed as true the state's empirical claim that it had a means of identifying a class of individuals‚Äîthose to whom the state referred as \\"sexually violent predators\\"‚Äîwho were \\"extremely dangerous\\" due to their \\"likelihood of engaging in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence [being] high.\\" (Kansas v. Hendricks (1997) 521 U.S. 346, 351) In the High Court's analysis of whether the scheme served the traditionally punitive role of deterrence, the court further empirically assumed the targeted class of individuals could not be deterred ‚Äì thus severe volitional impairment was required. (Hendricks, Ibid. at pages 362-363) The High Court was confident that \\"the confinement's duration [was] linked to the stated purposed of the commitment, namely, to hold the person until his mental abnormality no longer causes him to be a threat to others.\\" (Hendricks, Ibid. at pages 363) The distinction, between (i) the class of sex offenders who must be released after having completed their prison sentences and (ii) those who could be \\"civilly\\" detained, was believed to have been that the later class was made up of individuals who suffered from mental abnormalities which caused them to have \\"serious difficulty in controlling behavior\\", thus making them distinguishable \\"from the dangerous but typical recidivist\\" that must be released. (Kansas v. Crane (2002) 534 U.S. 407, 413) In both Hendricks and Crane the state was given deferential preference in asserting its factual findings regarding this so- called \\"sexually violent predator\\" class which it claimed was identifiable and distinguishable, as noted above, from recidivists who may be dangerous, but who were not subject to severe volitional impairment problems caused as a result of their mental abnormality. Recent data has indicated that the High Court's faith in the state's factual findings was misplaced. Data indicates that the states that have implemented sexually violent predator laws have failed to distinguish between those who truly suffer from mental abnormalities that cause them to suffer from severe volitional impairment likely to lead to reoffending from both the typical recidivist as well as the overwhelming majority of former sex offenders who will never reoffend.

Collection  Permanent Collection: The permanent collection of the Huntsville Museum of Art comprises over 3,000 objects; it is focused primarily on 19th and 20th century American art with an emphasis on art from the Southeast. African, Asian, and European art, from cultures influential on American art, is the Museum's secondary collecting focus. The collection holds some 400 works on paper by American artists such as James McNeill Whistler, Reginald Marsh, John Sloan, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, and Andy Warhol. These works have allowed the Museum to provide its community first-hand access to original works of art by leading 20th century masters. The Museum has also acquired works which are of particular importance to Huntsville and its scientific community, such as a group of watercolors of Huntsville and the Marshall Space Flight Center by Renato Moncini, who worked for NASA as an illustrator in the Apollo program. Another work is the Moonwalk by Andy Warhol.Andy Warhol (1928-1987) Moonwalk There are also European and Japanese prints, Chinese glassware and African sculptures. The museum is also famous for its collection of animal figures made from silver, the largest in the world, and the Italian jewelry produced by Gianmaria Buccellati.Vincent-Emmanuel Ragot Gianmaria Buccellati Since 1998, nearly 70 contemporary works in wood, glass, metal, clay and fiber have been added to the collection, including works by Dale Chihuly, William Morris and Philip Moulthrop. In 2008, the Museum acquired the prestigious Sellars Collection of Art by American Women, a landmark gathering of over 400 paintings, drawings and sculptures that heralds achievements of more than 250 American women artists active between 1850 and 1940. An eclectic holding of more than 600 works in various media form the remainder of the collection, such as the unique assembly of sterling silver animals created by the luxury Italian jewelry firm of Buccellati; European and Japanese prints; Chinese snuff bottles; carved African objects; and other valuable community resources that affirm that artistic heritage and provide context for American achievements in the arts. In 2017, the Museum acquired the historic Portrait of Ethel Waters, created by well-known artist, Luigi Lucioni. HMA Executive Director, Christopher J. Madkour, and Luigi Lucioni Historian, Dr. Stuart Embury, heard of the painting and began taking measures to track down its whereabouts. When the two traced it to a private residence in 2016, they learned the family had plans to auction the painting off in the coming months. The owner graciously allowed the Huntsville Museum of Art to display Ethel Waters in the exhibition, American Romantic: The Art of Luigi Lucioni, where it was viewed by the public for the first time since 1942. The Museum successfully negotiated the purchase of Portrait of Ethel Waters and, thanks in large part to the generosity of the Huntsville community, Lucioni's Portrait of Ethel Waters now has a new home at the Huntsville Museum of Art where it will be made accessible for public viewing. Collections for Travel: The Huntsville Museum of Art has two collections available for travel: Rebels with a Cause and John James Audubon: The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America. Rebels With a Cause presents outstanding selections of painting, drawings and sculptures from The Huntsville Museum of Art's recently acquired Sellars Collection of Art by American Women. This landmark holding celebrates the achievements of over 250 talented female artists active between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries. Many rebelled against the convention of their day by exhibiting alongside their male counterparts, receiving awards, and pioneering the way for those who would follow. Today, art historians are rediscovering their accomplishments and establishing their rightful place in the expanding narrative of American history. John James Audubon: The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America presents 36 original large-format Audubon prints from the private collection of Mr. & Mrs. William H. Told, Jr. of New York. The Told's collected these prints for nearly four decades, having received their first ‚Äî a marmot ‚Äî as a gift. They appreciated the scientifically accurate animal subjects (some of which are now extinct) as well as the beautifully detailed backgrounds that often included native foliage and other naturalistic details. The Tolds have graciously donated their impressive collection to the Huntsville Museum of Art.

In the 1850s, western photographers set up studios in the coastal port cities, but soon their Chinese assistants and local competition spread to all regions. By the end of the nineteenth century, all major cities had photographic studios where middle-class Chinese could have portraits taken for family occasions. Western and Chinese photographers documented ordinary street life, major wars, and prominent figures. Affluent Chinese adopted photography as a hobby. Empress Dowager Cixi had her portrait taken repeatedly. In the twentieth century, photography in China‚Äîas in other countries around the world‚Äîwas used for recreation, record keeping, newspaper and magazine journalism, political propaganda, and fine-art photography. According to the scholar Meccarelli, Chinese photography is the result of several factors: > * the study of optics (invention of camera obscura) * the development of > modern chemistry (photosensitive substances) * the diffusion and settlement > of Western medicine (especially anatomy) * the presence of Westerners and > missionaries (know-how and use of the photographic tool) 1842‚Äì1890, early history Wenchang Pavilion (ÊñáÊòåÈòÅ) of the Summer Palace (Yihe Yuan), before being burnt down.

Li Zhensheng was one of the few photographers who managed to take pictures in an honest way during the Cultural Revolution. Subjects of his Cultural Revolution photographs included \\"negative\\" scenes such public humiliation, street violence, executions, etc., as well as \\"positive\\" moments, like people studying Mao's works, singing revolutionary slogans, performing loyalty dance, and participating in farm work, etc. Li's photographs of the Cultural Revolution are published in a book titled \\"Red-Color News Soldier\\" by Phaidon. 1976‚Äì1993 The April Fifth Movement in 1976 marked the start of a new photographic vision in China. During the movement, ordinary citizens (amateur photographers) picked up the cameras and documented people's public mourning for Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. A couple of years later, some of these photographs were published in a book called \\"People's Mourning\\". Many of these amateur photographers became professional ones and joined the official press. They also found an unofficial photo club called \\"April Photo Society.\\" The aftermath of the Cultural Revolution led to a documentary photography movement that rapidly grew in strength. Many photojournalists worked for the state, and therefore they do not own their copyright in their work. 1993‚Äìpresent The establishment in 1993 of the East Village area of the capital Beijing, established an artistic coterie that used photography as an adjunct to experimental performance art and conceptual art. In 1994, Rong Rong co-founded the first Chinese conceptual art photography magazine, New Photo. Many artist-photographers have had success, especially in the west. Although their work has not been as explicitly political as that by very similar conceptual artists in the west, it has used the same repertoire of 'shock'; nakedness, swear words, dead babies and elephant dung, among other items that have now become tired clich√©s. Some photographers also work in 'Chinese kitsch' ‚Äì sometimes called \\"Mao goes Pop\\" ‚Äì a collage style very similar to western pop art of the 1960s. Presently, we are reminded of the discursive autonomy contemporary Chinese art is increasingly afforded, seen in works by artists such as Xu Zhen, Xing Danwen, and Zhang Yue ‚Äì artists who can not be easily summarized under the umbrella of a single artistic praxis such as \\"kitsch\\" or \\"pop\\" or \\"shock.\\" Chinese magazines for photography *Chinese Photography (‰∏≠ÂúãÊîùÂΩ±, Peking) publishing as of 1957 *Popular Photography (Â§ß‰ºóÊîùÂΩ± (Â§ßË°ÜÊîùÂΩ±), Peking) publishing as of 1958 See also * Felice Beato * Henri Cartier-Bresson * Robert Capa * China Lucky Film * Auguste Fran√ßois * Hakuy≈ç Fuchikami * Greg Girard * Tadahiko Hayashi * Joris Ivens * Hou Bo * Li Zhensheng * Liu Xucang * Lu Guang * Ma Liuming * Hedda Morrison * Mu Qing * Ou Ning * Wang Qingsong * Qiu Zhijie * Eva Sandberg * Marc Riboud * Pierre Rossier * William Saunders (photographer) * John Thomson (photographer) * Xia Xiao Wan * Xu Xiaobing * Yip Cheong Fun * Zheng Guogu * Zhang Ou Further reading * Naomi Rosenblum, A World History of Photography * Brush & Shutter: Early Photography in China, 2011, Getty Publications/Hong Kong University Press,  * * Meccarelli M., Foo Y., Flamminii A. and the West in the Art of the Nineteenth Century: A Cultural and Historical Review of the Relations between Painting and Photography\\" Ming Qing Studies 2013, pp. 117‚Äì160 * Meccarelli M. \\"New Perspectives about the Origins of Chinese Photography and Western Research in China\\" in ARTE DAL MEDITERRANEO AL MAR DELLA CINA Genesi ed incontri di scuole e stili.

He studied western science and medicine (rangaku) at the domain school Meirinkan in Hagi, and in Nagasaki, He was then sent by Ch≈çsh≈´ domain to Germany to study western law in 1868. However, while in Germany, his studies ranged over a very wide area, from western medicine, to politics, military science, and economics. From his surviving notes, he studied how to make beer, paper and paper money, carpets and rugs and techniques of western forestry management. Aoki returned to Japan after the Meiji Restoration, and entered the Foreign Ministry of new Meiji government in 1873 as First Secretary to the Japanese legations to Germany, Netherlands and Austria. He then served as Vice Foreign Minister in the first It≈ç administration and Foreign Minister in the first Yamagata administration. While Foreign Minister, he strove for the revision the unequal treaties between the Empire of Japan and the various European powers, particularly the extraterritoriality clauses, and expressed concern over the eastern expansion of the Russian Empire into east Asia. Aoki commissioned in 1888 an architect and friend from Berlin times, Matsugasaki Tsumunaga, to build him a villa as resort in Nasu highlands. This villa was costly restored in recent years and entered the list of Important Cultural Properties of Japan.See Japanese link of this page Matsugasaki won Aoki as first president of the newly established Society of Japanese Architects in 1888.see Okada Aoki was forced to resign as a consequence of the ≈åtsu Incident of 1891, but resumed his post as Foreign Minister under the Matsukata administration.

From the museum‚Äôs early years many of its most notable acquisitions were made possible through proceeds from the Annual Outdoor Arts and Crafts Fair, cosponsored by the Art Patrons League and the Mobile Museum of Art. It was the Art Patrons League that through many years envisioned and supported the creation of a contemporary crafts collection. In more recent years it is primarily the gifts of generous collectors that have built upon this legacy and helped transform the collection. In 2001 while the new facility was under construction, Elise Haverty and Dr. J. Rhodes Haverty of Atlanta made their first gift of contemporary glass. International in its scope, their gift now consists of over 183 pieces.

Biography He was born on April 17, 1868, in Glassboro, New Jersey. Bristol graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1887. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he served aboard the battleship USS Texas and participated in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. From 1901 to 1903, he served as aide to the Commander-in-Chief North Atlantic Fleet. He commanded the battleship USS Oklahoma during World War I. He served as the US High Commissioner in Turkey (1919‚Äì1927). His correspondence and other documents that he gathered are often cited during discussions on numerous events of that era, including Turkish-Armenian relations in which he played a significant role in his opposition to Armenian aspirations and American involvement in assuming a mandate in Armenia,Hovannisian, Richard G., The Republic of Armenia: The First Year, 1918‚Äì1919. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971, p. 298, note 23. The documents include writings such as the following in reference to a Greek newspaper reporter: \\"Mrs. Danos was typical of the races in this part of the country. She is obsequious and cringing and says she wants the truth but she probably couldn't write the truth if she knew it.\\" The collection includes several examples of such opinions. It is particularly rich in its coverage of Bristol's duties as commander of the US Naval Detachment in Turkish Waters and concurrent service as US High Commissioner to Turkey after World War I. Topics from the period include racial and religious conflicts in the Near East; the Great Fire of Smyrna; Allied activities in pursuit of special interests, mandates, and empire; the decline of the Ottoman Empire; and the rise of Mustafa Kemal and the Nationalist Movement, which led to the founding of modern Turkey. In 1927, Bristol assumed command of the Asiatic Fleet and helped found the American Hospital in Ni≈üanta≈üƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, in 1920 and the annexed nursing school, which is still named Admiral Bristol Nursing School after him. Bristol served as chairman of the General Board of the United States Navy from 1930 to 1932 and died on May 13, 1939. After his death, in 1945 he was honored by the renaming of the American Hospital in Turkey to the Admiral Bristol American Hospital. Namesakes Two ships have been named USS Bristol in his honor.

Corbin was born in Paris in April 1903. Although he was Protestant by birth, he was educated in the Catholic tradition and at the age of 19 received a certificate in Scholastic philosophy from the Catholic Institute of Paris. Three years later he took his \\"licence de philosophie\\" under the Thomist √âtienne Gilson. In 1928 he encountered Louis Massignon, director of Islamic studies at the Sorbonne, and it was he who introduced Corbin to the writings of Suhrawardi, the 12th century Persian mystic and philosopher whose work was to profoundly affect the course of Corbin's life. Years later Corbin said \\"through my meeting with Suhrawardi, my spiritual destiny for the passage through this world was sealed. Platonism, expressed in terms of the Zoroastrian angelology of ancient Persia, illuminated the path that I was seeking.\\" Corbin is responsible for redirecting the study of Islamic philosophy as a whole. In his Histoire de la philosophie islamique (1964), he challenged the common view that philosophy among the Muslims came to an end after Ibn Rushd.Corbin, Henry. Encyclopedia of Religion. Life and work The philosophical life and career of Corbin can be divided into three phases. The first is the 1920s and 1930s, when he was involved in learning and teaching western philosophy. The second is the years between 1939 and 1946, in which he studied Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi and the School of Illumination in Istanbul. The last begins at 1946 and lasts until his death, in which he studied and reintroduced eastern and Islamic philosophy. In 1933 he married Stella Leenhardt. In 1938, he completed the first translation of one of Heidegger's works into French (Was ist Metaphysik?, as Qu‚Äôest-ce que la metaphysique?). In 1939 they traveled to Istanbul, and in 1945 to Tehran. They returned to Paris one year later in July 1946. In 1949, Corbin first attended the annual Eranos Conferences in Ascona, Switzerland. In 1954 he succeeded Louis Massignon in the Chair of Islam and the Religions of Arabia. From the 1950s on he spent autumn in Tehran, winter in Paris and spring in Ascona. The three major works upon which his reputation largely rests in the English speaking world were first published in French in the 1950s: Avicenna and the Visionary Recital, Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn 'Arabi and Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth. His later major work on Central Asian and Iranian Sufism appears in English with an Introduction by Zia Inayat Khan as The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism. His magnum opus is the four volume En Islam Iranien: Aspects spirituels et philosophiques. It has been translated into Farsi twice by Dr Enshollah Rahmati and Reza Kuhkan from French (the 4th volume being still untranslated ). ,Corbin, Henry (1978) En Islam Iranien: Aspects spirituels et philosophiques Gallimard, Paris, OCLC 6776221 He died on 7 October 1978.Lakhani, M. Ali. The Corbin Trilogy by Thom Cheetham. Review in Sacred Web, Volume 23, Summer 2009. Main themes There are several main themes which together form the core of the spirituality that Corbin defends. The Imagination is the primary means to engage with Creation. Prayer is the \\"supreme act of the creative imagination\\". He considered himself a Protestant Christian but he abandoned a Christocentric view of history. The grand sweep of his theology of the Holy Spirit embraces Judaism, Christianity and Islam. He defended the central role assigned in theology for the individual as the finite image of the Unique Divine. His mysticism is no world-denying asceticism but regards all of Creation as a theophany of the divine. This vision has much in common with what has become known as Creation Spirituality, and the figure of the Angel Holy Spirit is similar to what is sometimes called the Cosmic Christ.Irib. ir, Henri Corbin view point on Isalam and Iran Legacy and influence Corbin's ideas continue to have an impact through the work of colleagues, students and many others influenced by his work. Though this list is far from complete, these include the following prolific Western scholars of Sufism and Islamic thought: Seyyed Hossein Nasr, William Chittick, Christian Jambet, Ali Amir-Moezzi, Hermann Landolt, Pierre Lory, James Cowan, James Morris, and Todd Lawson. In England his influence has been felt in the work of Kathleen Raine, Phillip Sherrard and other members of the Temenos Academy. Corbin was an important source for the archetypal psychology of James Hillman and others who have developed the psychology of Carl Jung. The American literary critic Harold Bloom claims Corbin as a significant influence on his own conception of Gnosticism, and the American poet Charles Olson was a student of Corbin's Avicenna and the Visionary Recital. Corbin's friends and colleagues in France have established L'Association des Amis de Henry et Stella Corbin for the dissemination of his work through meetings and colloquia, and the publication of his posthumous writings.Amis Corbin (trans. Friends of Corbin) in FrenchHenry Corbin and the Resolution of Modern Problems by Recourse to the Concept of the Imaginal Realm,by SEYYED MOHSEN MIRI, pdf Corbin's work has been criticized by a number of writers, including Steven M. Wasserstrom. Corbin's scholarly objectivity has been questioned on the basis of both a Shi'ite bias, and his theological agenda; he has been accused of being both ahistorically naive and dangerously politically reactionary; and he has been charged with being both an Iranian nationalist and an elitist in both his politics and his spirituality. Forceful rejoinders to the more damning of these critiques by Lory and Subtelny have been particularly lucid.Lory, Pierre (1999).

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and declared a Mississippi Landmark in 1985. The building originally served as the home of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian until the city of Meridian bought the building in 1911 and turned it into a Carnegie Library in 1913.First Presbyterian Church of Meridian Official Site The city originally constructed two Carnegie libraries ‚Äî one for whites and one for African-Americans; the building currently housing the Meridian Museum of Art served as the white library. In 1970, after the libraries integrated and moved to a new location, the vacant building at 628 25th Avenue was transformed into the Meridian Museum of Art and still operates today.Meridian Star - I could write a book... . An article on the history of Meridian's libraries. First Presbyterian Church of Meridian The lot on which the building resides was originally owned by Richard McLemore, the first settler in the Meridian area in 1831. When construction of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad began in the area, most of McLemore's land was bought by Lewis A. Ragsdale, including the lot at 25th Ave and 7th St on which the museum now stands.History of Meridian, MS In 1867 Ragsdale donated the lot to members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, and they built a small wooden structure in which to hold worship services. A fire on January 24, 1883, burned the building to the ground, but it was later rebuilt in the same location with brick by members of the church. On September 25, 1911, the church sold the building to the city of Meridian. Carnegie Library Postcard of the museum when it was one of Meridian's Carnegie public libraries Israel Marks, who helped operate the Marks-Rothenberg Department Store next door to the Grand Opera House, was an acquaintance of philanthropist Andrew Carnegie from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1904, after being asked by citizens of Meridian, Marks approached Carnegie about funding for a library in the city. Marks convinced Carnegie to issue a $38,000 grant to the city's government to build two Carnegie libraries ‚Äî one for whites and one for African-Americans.Meridian Star - The little museum that could, and did, thrive into the Twenty-first century The city used the money both to renovate the vacant building (formerly owned by First Presbyterian Church of Meridian) at 25th Ave and 7th St and transform it into a library, and to build another library for African-Americans at 13th St and 28th Ave on land donated by a local Methodist church. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated, combined their collections, and moved all materials to the new Meridian Public Library at 2517 7th St. The 13th street library is also listed on the National Register as Carnegie Branch Library. Art museum One of the first art organizations in the city, The Meridian Art League, was established in February 1933. From 1933 to 1949, art exhibitions were held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian. In 1949, The Meridian Art League changed its name to Meridian Art Association and began to hold exhibitions on the second floor of the Marks-Rothenberg Department Store. For the next 20 years, exhibits were held at various locations throughout the city, including the Meridian Public Library, the Strand Theatre, Alex Loeb Department Store, First National Bank, Merchants and Farmers Bank, Sears, the Broadmoor Shopping Center, and Weidmann's Restaurant. After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th street was closed and the operations moved to the new public library, the Meridian Art Association began talks with the city of transforming the vacant building into an art museum. This would give the association a permanent home for its exhibits. In December 1968, the Meridian Art Association raised $10,000 to start the museum; after many hours of effort, the grand opening was scheduled for January 1970. A fire on December 22, 1969, postponed the opening because some of the building had to be reconstructed. Today The building opened as the Meridian Museum of Art in late 1970 and has since served as the region's premiere public museum. It features rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. The museum offers more free programming than any other museum in the state and holds over 30 exhibitions annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art. The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits, 20th century photography, and several sculptures.City of Meridian, MS - Attractions Along with the exhibits, the museum offers special classes and programs to encourage participation by Meridian Community College, as well as city and county schools in Lauderdale County and the entire two-state area.

The term derives from the Sherlock Holmes novel The Hound of the Baskervilles in which a hellish-looking dog chases Sir Charles Baskerville, sufferer of a chronic heart disease. According to legend, the dog cursed his family, Baskerville runs in great fear and dies of a heart attack \\"with an expression of horror in his face.\\" Origin of the term The Baskerville effect was named by David Phillips and his colleagues at the University of California, San Diego, on a paper where they reported that the daily number of deaths of Chinese and Japanese Americans from heart attacks between 1973 and 1998 was 7 percent higher on the fourth of the month compared to the average for the other days in that month, while this was not observed in the general American population. Four (Âõõ, formal writing: ËÇÜ, pinyin si4) is considered an unlucky number in Chinese, and hence in the Japanese and Korean, because it sounds like \\"death\\" (Ê≠ª pinyin si3). Some Chinese and Japanese hotels and hospitals do not use it as a room number (the way that American architects don't use 13 as a floor number in office or hotel buildings). The authors, seeing how telephone line subscribers could choose the last four digits in their telephone numbers, found evidence that the number 4 is avoided among Chinese and Japanese Americans by searching the California Yellow Pages for telephone numbers of Chinese and Japanese restaurants, and finding that these had significantly fewer numbers 4 in this last section (366 out of 4748, or 7.71 percent) than it would be expected by chance (10 percent), a pattern not observed on restaurants listed as American. An analysis of the 20,000 computerized death certificates of Asian-Americans in San Diego, Phillips discovered that there was a 13 percent uptick in death rates on the fourth of the month. The hypothesis was that the peak was caused by stress induced by the superstition surrounding this number. Criticism, attempted replication and refutation In 2002, Gary Smith commented that Phillips and colleagues had omitted data from several heart disease categories, picking only those that happened to have a higher rate on the fourth day, calling them \\"chronic heart diseases\\". Smith also pointed out that they had not done this on their previous studies of Jewish deaths near Passover and Chinese deaths near the Harvest Moon, where they had used all heart disease categories. Smith also found no statistically relevant peaks on day 4 in data from 1969-1988 and 1999-2001 for total coronary deaths, inpatients, or the subset of heart diseases used by Phillips and colleagues, adding that there were more deaths on day 5 in the 1969-1988 data, and more deaths on day 3 in the 1999-2001 data. In 2003, Nirmal Panesar and colleagues looked for this effect on the Chinese population of Hong Kong. They looked at mortality data from 1995 to 2000, comparing the days of the month with \\"deathly connotations\\" (4, 14 and 24) with the other days of the month on both the Lunar and Gregorian calendars, and found no statistically significant difference. In early 2018, Jonathan Jarry analysed this phenomenon, citing both Smith's and Panesar et al's papers, pointing out that, if the effect was real, a bigger effect would be seen in Asia, while the opposite occurs. Jarry states that the peak observed on the original study appears because of what the researchers decided to compare it to, and quotes epidemiologist Christopher Labos as concluding that ‚Äúwhile the number of deaths on Day 4 may be higher than average, it is not actually statistically higher than any individual day.‚Äù References Category:Cardiology Category:Urban legends ","title":"Baskerville effect"},{"id":"2611781","text":"The Venerable William Hutchins (18 March 1792 ‚Äì 4 June 1841) was an English churchman and academic, a Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge.

He headed the Corps of Topographical Engineers for 32 years, during which time he organized the mapping of the American West. Abert was born in Shepherdstown, Virginia (now West Virginia). He graduated from West Point in 1811, but declined a commission to practice law. After leaving West Point, he married Ellen Matlack Stretch in January 1812. He enlisted in the D.C. Militia during the War of 1812, and rejoined the army as a topographical engineer with the rank of brevet Major in October 1814. Abert volunteered as a private in the District of Columbia Militia for the defense of Washington in 1814, and was brevetted Major, Staff Topographical Engineer, for gallantry at the Battle of Bladensburg, Maryland, August 24, 1814. His son, James William Abert, who also became a member of the corps, was born in 1820.U.S. Corps of Tophographical Engineers In March 1829 John Abert was appointed to the leadership of the corps, and promoted to Colonel in July 1838. Officers working under him were responsible for the exploration and mapping of the lands west of the Mississippi River. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1845. In 1818 the US War Department created the Topographic Bureau as part of the Corps of Engineers, under the command of Major Isaac Roberdeau. The Topographic Bureau was assigned six men and was to collect and store maps and topographical reports. When Roberdeau died in 1829, Abert became the head of the Bureau. He wanted to be free from the oversight of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and establish a separate Topographic Corps. in 1831 Abert was able to persuade Congress to remove the topographic engineers from the Corps of Engineers, and place them directly under the United States Secretary of War. In 1838, Abert was appointed the command of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, which position he would hold for 23 years. The Corps of Topographical Engineers had grown by then to thirty-six officers, including six majors, four captains by brevet, six civil engineers and twenty subalterns of the line. Abert recruited the best soldier-scientists he could find. These included John C. Fr√©mont, William H. Emory and Andrew A. Humphreys. Abert was a member of a number of legal, geographical and scientific societies. He was also a member of the Geographical Society of Paris, the Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie. He retired from the Army in September 1861. Abert died in Washington, D.C., and was buried in Rock Creek Cemetery.Find a Grave When he died, the US War Department wrote about Abert's accomplishments with the Corps of Topographical Engineers: \\"The Army and the country will not need to be reminded of the vast interest and value attached to the operations of this Corps since its organization. The geographical and other information concerning this continent which its officers have collected and published has challenged the admiration of the scientific world, while the practical benefit of their labors has been felt in nearly every State and every Territory; the whole forming a proud monument to him who was its founder. As a citizen and a man, Colonel Abert was remarkable for the steadfastness of his friendships, for his candor and unostentatious hospitality. Equally unostentatious, but no less sincere, was the simple piety which supported his declining years, and left behind an example which the proudest soldier would not be ashamed to follow.\\"United States War Department. 1863. \\"Obituary Order.\\" Issued January 27, 1863. Abert is the namesake of Lake Albert in South Dakota. Captain John C. Fremont named Lake Abert and Abert Rim in his honor when his 1843 expedition passed through southern Oregon.

It grew out of a small contingent of the Music Teachers National Association and, more directly, the New York Musicological Society (1930‚Äì1934). Its founders were George S. Dickinson, Carl Engel, Gustave Reese, Helen Heffron Roberts, Joseph Schillinger, Charles Seeger, Harold Spivacke, Oliver Strunk, and Joseph Yasser. Its first president was Otto Kinkeldey, the first American to receive an appointment as professor of musicology (Cornell University, 1930). Overview The society consists of individual members divided among fifteen regional chapters across the United States, Canada, and elsewhere, as well as subscribing institutions. It was admitted to the American Council of Learned Societies in 1951, and participates in the R√©pertoire International des Sources Musicales and the R√©pertoire International de Litt√©rature Musicale. The society's annual meetings consist of presentations, symposia, and concerts, as well as more-or- less informal meetings of numerous related musical societies. Many of the society's awards, prizes and fellowships are announced at these meetings. Publications Most of the society's resources are dedicated to musicological publications: the triannual Journal of the American Musicological Society (1948-present) published by the University of California Press. The journal was preceded by the annual Bulletin (1936‚Äì1947) and the annual Papers (1936‚Äì1941). Online versions of these publications are available at JSTOR and the University of California Press. Other studies and documents published by the society include the complete works of William Billings, edited by Karl Kroeger et al. (4 vols, 1977‚Äì1990), the series Music of the United States of America (1993‚Äìpresent), Johannes Ockeghem's collected works edited by Dragan Plamenac and Richard Wexler (3 vols., 1966, 1992), John Dunstaple's complete works edited by Manfred Bukofzer, published jointly with Musica Britannica (1970), Joseph Kerman's The Elizabethan Madrigal (1962), E.

They were heavily built plant eaters, and they may have lived partly in water, as hippopotamuses do. They had short, thick heads and might have competed by head-butting each other. Their elbow joints allowed them to walk with a more mammal-like gait rather than crawling. Their remains were found in the Karoo region of South Africa, belonging to the Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone. Therapsids, such as Moschops, are synapsids, the dominant land animals in the Permian period, which ended 252 million years ago. Description A close-up of a reconstructed Moschops capensis skull, from the American Museum of Natural History. An artist's conception of Moschops capensis, based on the reconstruction of a skeleton found in a semi-desert region of South Africa. The skeleton is displayed at the American Museum of Natural History. Moschops were heavy set dinocephalian synapsid, that were roughly in length. They had small heads with broad orbits and heavily-built short necks. Like other members of Tapinocephalidae, the skull had a tiny opening for the pineal organ.The Age of Reptiles The occiput was broad and deep, but the skull was more narrow in the dorsal border. Furthermore, the pterygoid arches and the angular region of the jaw with heavily-bult jaw muscles. Due to that and the possession of long-crowned, stout teeth, it is believed that Moschops was a herbivore feeding on nutrient-poor and tough vegetation, like cycad stems. Due to the presumably nutrient-poor food, it's likely they had to feed for a long periods of time. The anatomy of the taxa allowed them to open the elbow joints more widely, enabling them to move in a more mammal-like posture than some other animals at the time. This helped to carry their massive bodies more easily while feeding, as well as, allowing them short bursts of speed. It has also been proposed that Moschops were possibly sub-aquatic. Moschops had rather thick skulls, prompting speculation that individuals could have competed with one another by head-butting. A 2017 published study would later confirm this by synchrotron scanning a Moschops capensis skull, whiched revaled numerous anatomical adaptations to the central nervous system for combative behaviour.https://peerj.com/articles/3496/?utm_source=TrendMD&utm;_campaign=PeerJ_TrendMD_1&utm;_medium=TrendMD They were likely preyed upon by titanosuchids and larger therocephalians species. Earliest finds Moschops material was discovered for the first time by Robert Broom in the Ecca Group (part of the Karoo Supergroup) in South Africa. The geological horizon dubious, it was referred to that group on the basis of Pareiasaurus remains in near proximity. The material includes a holotype (AMNH 5550) and seven topotypes (AMNH 5551-5557). The degree of pachyostosis varies within the skulls of the specimens. According to Broom, it is because of gender and age variation within the discovered specimens. In 1910, the material was sent to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and it was described in 1911. Classification Size comparison Moschops is characterized by a strongly pachyostosed skull with a broad intertemporal region and greatly reduced temporal fossae. Two species are known from the fossil record, M. capensis and M. koupensis. Two other species were assigned (M. whaitsi and M. oweni), but their validity is considered possibly dubious. Genera regarded as synonyms are Moschoides, Agnosaurus, Moschognathus and Pnigalion. Delphinognathus conocephalus could represent juvenile Moschops, thus possibly synonymous. Delphinognathus is only known from a single, moderately pachyostosed skull. It has a conical boss on the parietal surrounding the pineal foramen.

On leaving school at the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to an Osnabr√ºck optician, and in 1851 he came to London, where he obtained work with an optician, W Hewitt, who shortly afterwards, with his workmen, entered the employment of Andrew Ross, a lens and telescope manufacturer. Dallmeyer's position in this workshop appears to have been an unpleasant one, and led him to take, for a time, employment as French and German correspondent for a commercial firm. After a year he was, however, re-engaged by Ross as scientific adviser, and was entrusted with the testing and finishing of the highest class of optical apparatus. This appointment led to his marriage with Ross's second daughter, Hannah, and to the inheritance, at Ross's death (1859), of a third of his employer's large fortune and the telescope manufacturing portion of the business. Turning from astronomical work to the design and making of photographic lenses, he introduced improvements in both portrait and landscape lenses, in object-glasses for the microscope and in condensers for the optical lantern. An important invention was the Rapid Rectilinear camera objective. In connection with celestial photography he constructed photo-heliographs for the Wilna observatory in 1863, for the Harvard College Observatory in 1864, and, in 1873, several for the British government. Dallmeyer's instruments achieved a wide success in Europe and America, taking the highest awards at various international exhibitions. The Russian government gave him the order of St Stanislaus, and the French government made him chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He was for many years upon the councils of both the Royal Astronomical Society and Royal Photographic Society. About 1880 he was advised to give up the personal supervision of his workshops, and to travel for his health, but he died on board ship, off the coast of New Zealand, on 30 December 1883. His second son, Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer assumed control of the business on the failure of his father's health.

His maternal grandfather, Andrew Ross, was himself the first English photographic optician. Life After attending other schools, Thomas enrolled at Mill Hill School where he came under the tutelage of Dr. J.A.H. Murray who is best known as an editor of the Oxford English Dictionary. After leaving school, he entered his father's optometry business, while learning the theoretical side from Oliver Lodge. When Thomas was twenty-one, his father went on a long voyage to recuperate from overwork but died during the journey. Thomas took over and not only maintained the reputation of the lenses his father had designed but he continually improved them and added new patterns. Among his principal inventions was the first practical telephoto lens (patented 1891) which he afterwards elaborated into many special forms for various purposes, a rapid landscape lens, a rectilinear landscape lens, some of the earliest rapid lenses made with lenses from Jena, Germany, and the Adon and Junior Adon telephoto lenses. He also invented the Naturalist's Camera for which he received the medal of the Royal Photographic Society. He also designed the Dallmeyer-Bergen lens, which was the prototype of the anachromatic lenses. It was suggested by a painter, J.S. Bergheim, who wished for a lens which would give him correct drawing and soft definition without sacrificing the natural structure of the original.American Photography, Vol. 15, (1921) p. 74 He was the author of a standard book on the subject of telephoto lenses, Telephotography (1899).Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer (1899) Telephotography: an elementary treatise on the construction, and application of the telephotographic lens, William Heinemann, London He served as president of the Royal Photographic Society in 1900-1903.

Developed as a modernized version of the earlier T-37A light tank, the T-38 proved to be only a moderate improvement over its predecessor, and was eventually replaced in 1940 by the T-40. History Early trials of the T-37A revealed many deficiencies in its design, including limited range, sub-par buoyancy, and an unreliable transmission and running gear that could cause its tracks to fall off while on the move.Baryatinskiy, p. 15-19 Development of an improved version of the tank that would fix these flaws was begun in late 1934 at Factory No. 37 in Moscow, under the direction of Chief Designer N. Astrov and Chief Engineer N. Kozyrev.Zaloga, p. 77-79 The redesign proved to be so extensive that the project was given the independent designation T-38, and a prototype was completed by June 1935. The T-38 retained many design features of the T-37A, including its repurposed GAZ-AA engine and hand-operated turret. The turret was moved from the right to the left-hand side of the tank, switching the driver and commander positions compared to the T-37A. The T-38 also had a slightly wider and lower profile than its predecessor, providing an advantage in buoyancy that made the cork buoys used on the T-37A unnecessary. While the production-model T-38 was only armed with a 7.62mm DT machine gun, the initial prototype vehicle also included a 20mm ShVAK cannon mounted on the driver's position. This was removed after it was determined the additional cannon impaired the driver's ability to control the tank.Milsom, p. 91 Like other light tanks of its time, the T-38 was designed for reconnaissance and infantry support roles. As a scout tank the T-38 had the advantages of a very low silhouette and good long- range mobility through its ability to swim. The T-38 was also intended to be air-portable; during the Kiev maneuvers in 1936, the tanks were transported by Tupolev TB-3 bombers, mounted under the fuselage. Infantry battalions were each issued 38 T-38s, with 50 being designated for each airborne armored battalions. However, the thin armor and single machinegun armament made the tank of only limited use in combat and the lack of a radio in most T-38s was a serious limitation for a reconnaissance vehicle. The T-38 also struggled with carrying any excess cargo across water. The tank was incapable of supporting the weight of two infantrymen while floating, and overloads of 120-150 kilos would cause the commander's hatch to flood, sinking the vehicle. These flaws were to be fixed by the T-38's successor, the T-40, but only a small number were built before the outbreak of World War II, leaving the T-37A and T-38 to form the bulk of the Red Army's amphibious tanks.Baryatinskiy, p. 58-63 A total of 1,228 T-38 tanks were built from 1936 to 1937, with an additional 112 made in 1939 after a two-year break in production. Service history T-38 of the Red Army captured by the LAF fighters in Kaunas, Lithuania T-38RT armed with 20 mm cannon on display at the Central Armed Forces Museum in Moscow. The tank served with the Red Army in the Winter War with Finland in 1940, but was unsuccessful due to its light armament and thin armour, which was easily penetrated by rifle and light machine gun fire. In the confined terrain of Finland, the tank was a deathtrap; it also did not do well in the early stages of World War II, and large numbers were captured by the Germans during Operation Barbarossa. The T-38 was rarely seen in direct combat after 1941 and mostly relegated to other roles such as artillery tractor, although it was reported to have been used in the Dnieper River crossing of 1943. During World War II, the main amphibious scout vehicle of the Red Army was the Ford GPA amphibious jeep, an open unarmored vehicle provided through Lend-Lease. The German Army did not generally use captured T-38s as gun tanks (unlike captured T-26s, T-34s, or other more valuable vehicles). Romanian forces had captured three T-38s as of 1 November 1942 and four more in March 1944.Mark Axworthy, Cornel I.

Kahn, known for his combination of Realism and Color Field, worked in pastel, oil paint, and printmaking. He studied under Hans Hofmann, and also graduated from the University of Chicago. Kahn was a resident of both New York City and, during the summer and autumn, West Brattleboro, Vermont. Life and career Wolf Kahn was born in 1927 in Stuttgart, Germany, the fourth child of Emil and Nellie Budge Kahn. Kahn's father was a notable figure in the music world. He was a musician, composer, conductor, and teacher. Kahn's family was Jewish.http://www.wolfkahn.com/writing/unlocking-the-unconscious In 1933, Kahn's father lost his appointment with the Stuttgart Philharmonic Orchestra when Adolf Hitler came into power and, with increasing antisemitism sweeping Germany, he and his second wife left Germany with Kahn's three siblings for the United States. Wolf was sent to live with his grandmother, Anna Kahn, in Frankfurt, Germany, at the age of three. He stated that he began drawing at the age of four. In 1937, the summer of his 11th birthday, his grandmother signed him up for private art lessons with Miss von Joeden. He drew every day and was inspired by military pageantry, Napoleonic Wars and prominent historical figures including Adolph Menzel and Frederick the Great. In 1939, when Kahn was 12 years old, his grandmother arranged for him to leave Germany for England to live with a host family, first with the John Wade family and then with the Purvis Family. As quotas for immigrant applications in the United States changed, Kahn was able to reunite with his family in New York City in 1940 at the age of 13. In 1942, Kahn was accepted for his sophomore year at the High School of Music and Art in New York City. His drawings morphed into caricatures. Kahn cited David Low and Thomas Nast as his favorite cartoonists.Interview with Wolf Kahn and Justin Spring, July 1995 His first job was graphics editor of the school newspaper, The Overtone. He graduated in 1945. After a year in the U.S. Navy after high school, Kahn first attended the New School to study painting under Stuart Davis. With the aid of the GI Bill, he was able to continue his studies with Abstract Expressionist Hans Hofmann at the Hans Hofmann School. He became Hofmann‚Äôs studio assistant by the summer of 1947 at Hofmann's Provincetown, Massachusetts studio. In 1949, Kahn was accepted into the University of Chicago's Hutchins Program, where he completed a bachelor's degree in eight months. In 1956, he met fellow painter Emily Mason, who he later joined in Venice, Italy. They married there in March 1957 at the municipal building near the Rialto Bridge, witnessed by strangers and friends including filmmaker Tinto Brass. In 1958 the couple returned to New York City where Mason gave birth to their first daughter Cecily in 1959. In 1963 the family returned to Italy. Their daughter Melany was born in Rome in 1964. In 1968 the couple bought a farm in Brattleboro, Vermont where they continued to summer. Kahn died on March 15, 2020 at the age of 92. Wolf Kahn's art Kahn worked in oil and pastel. His works usually cover the subject of landscapes and his own personal vision of nature. His convergence of light and color has been described as combining \\"pictorial landscapes and painterly abstraction\\". =Influences= Surrounded from birth by the work of such artists as Hans Thoma, Carl Spitzweg, Wilhelm Trubner, Franz Winterhalter, by Edwardian furniture, books and bronzes of Schiller and Goethe, it is no wonder that Kahn started drawing at a very young age. While at the University of Chicago, he became interested in philosophy, particularly the writings of Immanuel Kant while making sketches of sailboats riding anchor on Lake Michigan. Kahn loved the visual effects of Maine's coastline. In the late 1960s after a number of vacations on Deer Isle, Maine, the foggy conditions ultimately led to a significant shift in Kahn's painting. Years of monochromatic work concentrated on varying tonalities finally gave way to intense color. Kahn recalled later, \\"I began to let the color come through on my canvases...my pastels were always intense, and finally my painting caught up with them.\\" =Exhibitions= Kahn's very first exhibition was a group show titled, New Provincetown '47, curated by Clement Greenberg at the Seligmann Gallery on 57th Street in New York. The next exhibition would be self- organized by Kahn titled 813 Broadway in 1951. This was followed by a group exhibition in the fall of 1952 at the Hansa Gallery Cooperative, one of a few Hofmann student spinoffs. His first one-man solo exhibition would follow in 1953, also at Hansa Gallery, after a summer trip to Louisiana where he visited his art professor brother, Peter. A real break came after living and painting in Tepoztlan, Mexico, in a studio space afforded by Mrs. Norman. Kahn returned to New York City with an offer to join Grace Borgenicht Gallery in 1955. Her gallery had been in existence on 57th Street since May 1951. In 1960, Kahn accepted a position as a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Around this same time, his work was included in a major exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art titled Young America 1960: 30 Painters under 36. Until his death, Kahn remained very active, still creating new work and exhibiting multiple times per year. List of past and current exhibitions on Artsy.net In Winter of 2017, Kahn celebrated his 90th birthday with an exhibition of over fifty recent paintings at Miles McEnery Gallery (formerly Ameringer  McEnery  Yohe).

Kahn received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Vermont Council on the Arts 1998 and the National Academy in 2006. He received the University of Chicago Outstanding Alumni Professional Achievement Award in 2012 and the U.S. State Department awarded him the International Medal of Art in 2017. He has honorary doctorates from Wheaton College, 2000\\"Wolf Kahn, Honorary Degree Recipient\\", Wheaton College History. and Union College. Kahn became a member of the National Academy of Design in 1980 and the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1984. He was on the Board of Trustees for Marlboro College, in Marlboro, Vermont, and was an honorary trustee at the Brattleboro Museum in Brattleboro, Vermont. In 2005 the Smithsonian Art Collectors Program commissioned Kahn to produce a print to benefit the cultural and educational programs of the Smithsonian Associates. The screenprint, entitled Aura, hangs in the Graphic Eloquence exhibit in the S. Dillon Ripley Center on the National Mall. =Museum collections= Kahn's work can be found in numerous museum collections including: * Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL * Boca Raton Museum of Art, Boca Raton, FL * Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY * Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden * Colby College Museum of Art * Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, CA * Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY * Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY * Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Boston, MA * National Academy Museum, New York, NY * Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D.C. * National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC * Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY * Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, CT * Ackland Art Museum, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC References * Marika Herskovic, New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists (New York School Press, 2000). , pp. 32; 37; 194‚Äì197 External links * Wolf Kahn on ARTCYCLOPEDIA * Wolf Kahn Artwork Examples on AskART. * Wolf Kahn in Conversation with David Kapp and Robert Berlind, Brooklyn Rail, May 2007 * Wolf Kahn in Latter-Day Focus, Color & Consequence, Brooklyn Rail, July 2011 * Documentary film, (2004) Wolf Kahn at Niagara Falls * NewArtTV Interview Part I (2008) * NewArtTV Interview Part 2 (2008) * NHPR Inspired Lives, Interview by Mary Kuechenmeister, 2012 Category:Modern painters Category:American Figurative Expressionism Category:Landscape artists Category:1927 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Jewish artists Category:Art Students League of New York faculty Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:People from Brattleboro, Vermont Category:National Academy of Design members Category:20th-century American printmakers Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:21st-century male artists Category:The High School of Music & Art alumni Category:American people of German-Jewish descent ","title":"Wolf Kahn"},{"id":"2611826","text":"Ripon Falls at the northern end of Lake Victoria in Uganda was formerly considered the source of the river Nile.

His technique and expression are highly acclaimed. By the age of 32, Yamashita had already released 52 albums, including repertoires for solo guitar, guitar concertos, chamber music and collaborations with other renowned musicians such as James Galway. To date, he has released a total of 83 albums. Musical career Yamashita began to study the guitar at the age of eight with his father, Toru Yamashita. In 1972, aged eleven, he won the Kyushu Guitar Competition. Four years later, he was awarded First Prize in the All Japan Guitar Competition. In 1977, he won three important international competitions - the Ramirez in Spain, the Alessandria in Italy and Paris Radio France Competition, being the youngest winner ever recorded. In 1978, Yamashita made his debut in Japan and, in the following year, traveled to Europe. While still in his twenties, he made his first appearances in Canada's Toronto International Guitar Festival and gave a solo recital in the Musikverein (Grosser Saal) in Vienna, he also performed in the US and UK. He gave solo recitals in concert halls around the world including Lincoln Center, Chicago Symphony Center Orchestra Hall, Teatro Olimpico,Concert programme 20/04/2018 St. Petersburg Philharmonia Grand Hall,Concert programme 17/11/2017 and has performed with a variety of orchestras and conductors in Europe, North America and Asia. In 1989, the Casals Hall in Tokyo, considered to be one of the finest auditoriums in the world, presented a series called The World of Kazuhito Yamashita, comprising seven concerts in 12 months. The high point of the concerts was Castelnuovo-Tedesco's 24 Caprichos de Goya in a single performance. The series concluded with Bach's six sonatas and partitas over two consecutive nights; a recital series was continued in 1994 and 1999. In addition to solo performances, Yamashita also plays duo, as well as with chamber music ensembles, orchestras and internationally acclaimed artists, such as Leonard Slatkin with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, Rafael Fr√ºhbeck de Burgos, Antoni Ros Marb√†, Garcia Navarro, Pedro Halffter, Hiroyuki Iwaki, NHK Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Orquesta de la RTVE, Claudio Scimone e I Solisti Veneti, James Galway (flute), Gary Karr (double bass), Michala Petri (recorder), The Tokyo String Quartet etc. In the 4th Santo Tirso International Guitar Festival, held in 1997, he played four guitar concertos in one night with the Cordoba orchestra, conducted by Leo Brouwer. Most recently, he is active in the guitar quartet Kazuhito Yamashita + Bambini. This quartet, consisting of Yamashita and his children, has performed at two international festivals in Italy, the Seoul Art Center in Korea, Portugal, Cordoba Festival in Spain, San Francisco Herbst Theatre and several cities throughout Japan. Yamashita has made a total of 83 recordings and numerous original arrangements of such works as Mussorgski's Pictures at an Exhibition, Stravinsky's Firebird, Rimsky-Korsakov's Scherezade and Dvo≈ô√°k's Symphony from the New World. He has recorded for BMG (RCA), Crown Classics, Japan Victor, King Records and Alfa Records. His recordings include 16 CDs with the complete works of Fernando Sor, and a collection of 5 CDs containing J.S. Bach's sonatas and partitas for violin, cello, lute and flute (BWV 995-1013), all which he himself transcribed for the guitar. His recording of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, released in 1981, was awarded the Deutsches Grammophon Award. His transcriptions of orchestral and virtuostic piano music is also considered by some as controversial.Kazuhito Yamashita: the world's most controversial classical guitarist? by Verdery, Benjamin; Gore, Joe (Guitar Player; March 1, 1994 Yamashita is an enthusiastic proponent of new works for the guitar and has given the world premier of more than 60 new compositions. In this regard, his world premier and presentation of the works of the Japanese composer Keiko Fujiie, his wife, is notable. In 1999, he received the National Arts Festival Grand Prize from the Japanese Government's Agency for Cultural Affairs for his CD recording of Japanese Guitar Music 1923-1948. Yamashita's early arrangements of Pictures at an Exhibition, Stravinsky's Firebird Suite, Dvo≈ô√°k's New World Symphony no. 9 in E Minor, and others, broke boundaries in terms of solo guitar expression and virtuosity. In 2004 \\"Kazuhito Yamashita + bambini\\" was founded by Kazuhito, his two daughters and elder son, to look to the risorgimento of a quintessential and older musical tradition. This recalls a bygone era of both the East and the West when such music was known and valued and whose echoes can still be heard in the classic 11th century novel \\"The Tale of Genji.\\" In 2010, his younger son joined them and they were renamed \\"Kazuhito Yamashita Family Guitar Quintet.\\" They have already appeared in festivals in Italy, Cordoba festival in Spain in 2007 and 2011, and have also performed in Portugal, Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and United States.

Some of his shipmates were Jacob Quaeckernaeck, Melchior van Santvoort, and William Adams. Although not allowed to return to the Netherlands, Joosten was allowed to take a Japanese wife and was given a permit to engage in foreign trade. He was privileged to wear the two swords of the samurai and received an annual stipend which placed him (along with Adams) among the ranks of the hatamoto or direct retainers of the sh≈çgun.Corr, Adams the Pilot: The Life and Times of Captain William Adams. Pp.158 Joosten was said to be a drunk with a choleric temperament, and at one point was not welcome at Ieyasu's court. Early life in Japan De Liefde (the Love, sometimes translated as the Charity) departed Rotterdam in 1598, on a trading voyage that was a five ship expedition to the East Indies. After making it through the Straits of Magellan, they became separated, but later rejoined the Hoop (Hope) off the coast of Chile, where some of the crew and captains of both vessels lost their lives in an encounter with natives. They decide to leave hostile Spanish waters and sell their woolen cloth cargo in Japan rather than in the warmer Moluccas. The two ships encountered a storm and Hoop was lost. With a decimated and sick crew (only 24 were still alive, and several were dying) the damaged De Liefde made landfall off Bungo (present-day Usuki) on the coast of Ky≈´sh≈´ in April 1600. Portuguese Jesuit missionary priests claimed that the ship was a pirate vessel and that the crew should be executed. The ship was seized on orders of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the daimy≈ç of Edo (modern Tokyo) and the future sh≈çgun, and later the crew was ordered to sail her to Sakai (near Osaka) and then on to Edo. Some of them were received by Ieyasu, who questioned them at length on European politics, wars and foreign affairs. The crew eventually went separate ways when some decided they should split the money provided as compensation for their losses of the ship and cargo.Letters Written by the English Residents in Japan, 1611‚Äì1623, with Other Documents on the English Trading Settlement in Japan in the Seventeenth Century, N.

The nineteen bronze cannons were unloaded from the ship and, according to Spanish accounts, later used at the decisive Battle of Sekigahara on October 21, 1600 (between Tokugawa forces and their rivals).http://www.engelfriet.net/Alie/Aad/deshima1.htm Trading Joosten is reported to have made a fortune in trade between Japan and Southeast Asia, chartering several Red Seal Ships under license from Tokugawa Ieyasu. He was reported by Dutch traders in Ayutthaya to be aboard junks carrying rich cargoes in early 1613. After the establishment of the Dutch Factory in Hirado, he became a middleman between Dutch merchants and the shogunate. He is also said to have been to Siam on one of his ships, with the Japanese adventurer and author Tenjiku Tokubei. Later, he attempted to return to the Netherlands, but after reaching Batavia, he was denied permission by Dutch authorities to proceed further. He drowned in the South China Sea in 1623 when his ship sank as he was returning to Japan.

The special economic zone at Falta is one of the eight such zones of the Government of India. It has container-handling jetty. The Government of West Bengal proposes to construct a minor port at Kulpi with facilities for handling containers. As large oceangoing ships with full load of goods cannot enter the river ports at Kolkata and Haldia, the need for a seaport in the area has been felt for a long time. Such a future port would obviously be located at south of Diamond Harbour but would enhance the importance of the place as a base for the port.

It is situated on the eastern banks of the Hooghly River. It is a part of the area covered by the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). History Hindu dharmic leader Swami Vivekananda landed at Budge Budge ferry ghat in 1897 when he returned from his Chicago visit. The anniversary is still celebrated on 19 February with great zeal. The old railway station from where he boarded the train to Calcutta is decorated with flowers on this day. The waiting room where he rested for a while is preserved. Budge Budge was the site where the ship Komagata Maru was allowed to land following its return from Vancouver. The ship was chartered by a group of Sikhs to challenge the exclusion laws enacted by Canada to restrict Indian immigration. Upon entry into the harbour, the ship was stopped by a British gunboat, and the passengers were placed under guard. The government of the British Raj saw the men on the Komagata Maru not only as self-confessed lawbreakers, but also as dangerous political agitators. When the ship docked at Budge Budge, the police went to arrest Baba Gurdit Singh and the 20 or so other men that they saw as leaders. He resisted arrest, a friend of his assaulted a policeman and a general riot ensued. Shots were fired and 19 of the passengers were killed. Some escaped, but the remainder were arrested and imprisoned or sent to their villages and kept under village arrest for the duration of the First World War. This incident became known as the Budge Budge Riot. Historically the oldest people of this city were the 'Haldars' who came here to guard a fort near the bank of the River Ganges. A British writer who had come with Clive around 1740-50 chronicled this event. Maniklal was the main person at the fort and his soldiers lost to Clive's troops.

Budge Budge owes much of its importance to the port, oil storage and jute mills.

At their height before 1971 these jute mills used to employ thousands of workers (New Central Jute Mills has been said to have employed as many as twenty thousand people) but after the partition of India and the subsequent creation of Bangladesh, supply of raw materials for these jute mills decreased. This, along with failure of trade unions lead to the closing of most of these jute mills.

Anthony Smythe). One Man's Family is an American radio soap opera, heard for almost three decades, from 1932 to 1959. Created by Carlton E. Morse, it was the longest-running uninterrupted dramatic serial in the history of American radio. Television versions of the series aired in prime time from 1949 to 1952 and in daytime from 1954 to 1955. Radio One Man's Family debuted as a radio series on April 29, 1932 in Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco, moving to the full West Coast NBC network the following month, sponsored by Snowdrift and Wesson Oil. On May 17, 1933, it expanded to the full coast-to-coast NBC network as the first West Coast show heard regularly on the East Coast. The show was broadcast as a weekly half-hour series (1933-1950) [sustained by Standard Brands from 1935 through 1949], then shifted to daily 15-minute installments, initially originating from the studios of San Francisco radio station KPO, NBC's flagship station for the West Coast, eventually moving to Los Angeles.Starr, Kevin. The Dream Endures: California Enters the 1940s . Oxford University Press, 1997. Characters and story The series employed a literary device with episodes divided into books and chapters. Spanning 27 years, the program presented 136 books with 3,256 chapters. Storylines were set in the Sea Cliff area of San Francisco, California, an area familiar to San Franciscan Carlton E. Morse. The radio plotline centered on stockbroker Henry Barbour, his wife Fanny and their five children (chronologically: Paul, Hazel, the twins Clifford and Claudia, and Jack). The dialogue included many specific references to San Francisco, including the Golden Gate Bridge, which the Barbours could see from their rear living room window or their garden wall. Smythe circa 1930s. Over the entire 27-year run, J. Anthony Smythe starred as Henry Barbour. The first Fanny was Minetta Ellen (1932‚Äì55), followed by Mary Adams. Michael Raffetto had the role of author-aviator Paul, but a voice problem led to his replacement in 1955 by Russell Thorson. Hazel was played by Bernice Berwin (1932‚Äì58). Beginning in 1932, Barton Yarborough portrayed Clifford, but the character was dropped from the storyline after Yarborough's death from a heart attack on December 19, 1951. Kathleen Wilson introduced the character of Claudia in 1932, continuing in the role until Claudia married in August 1943 and was written out of the story. When Claudia returned (1945‚Äì59), she was played by Barbara Fuller. Jack was portrayed by Page Gilman. The Barbour grandchildren were named Teddy, Hank, Pinky, Margaret, Skipper, Joan, Penny, Nicky, Elizabeth, Jane, Mary Lou, Abigail, Deborah, and Constance. Conrad Binyon played Henry Herbert Murray, Hank, from 1939 until his 1950 USAF / Calif. Air National Guard departure for the Korean War; he was replaced by Bill Idelson. In November 1947, Cousin Jediah X. Barbour (Clarence Hartzell) arrived at Sea Cliff. This gave the program an ambiance not unlike Vic and Sade, since Idelson played adopted son Rush on Vic and Sade, which also featured Hartzell as Uncle Fletcher Rush. The supporting cast in the 1930s and 1940s included Bill Bouchey, Tom Collins, Virginia Gregg, Bill Herbert, Wally Maher, Helen Musselman, Dan O'Herlihy, Walter Paterson, Ken Peters, Frank Provo, Jean Rouverol, Naomi Stevens, Janet Waldo and Ben Wright. After 3,256 episodes, the radio series ceased production on April 24, 1959 (several sources give the date of May 8, 1959). One Man's Family was the longest-running serial drama in American radio broadcasting, edging out Ma Perkins (although Ma Perkins produced over twice as many episodes). Organist Paul Carson, who played the background music and the opening theme, \\"Destiny Waltz\\" (1932‚Äì41), composed the show's later theme, \\"Waltz Patrice\\" (aka \\"Patricia\\"). Among its other trademarks, episodes were introduced as if they were chapters from books. Fiction Beginning in April 1942, scripts for One Man's Family were rewritten as prose fiction and serialized in Movie-Radio Guide. Satires As the radio version was coming to a conclusion, another radio team, Bob and Ray---already noted for poking fun at such radio programs as Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons (\\"Mr. Trace, Keener Than Most Persons\\") and Backstage Wife (\\"Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife\\")---launched a dry continuing satire of One Man's Family, \\"One Fella's Family,\\" as part of their daily 15-minute slot on CBS. \\"One Fella's Family\\" featured the two comedians as the Butcher family and lanced even the radio classic's signature chapter-and-verse introductions, with Ray Goulding giving the fictitious episode title and describing it, for example, \\"... which is taken from Book Vee Eye, Chapter Ex Eye, Pages 2,3,5,11, 243 and the top of page 244.\\" The show's title was also parodied by animator Tex Avery, in his 1943 MGM cartoon One Ham's Family. Overseas Two Australian versions of One Man's Family were broadcast in Australia in the late 1930s/early 1940s; in Sydney on 2CH and in Melbourne on 3XY. 3XY opened in 1935 and was originally a very low rating station, until the great popularity of One Man's Family changed its fortunes. The Melbourne version featured 3XY announcer Carl Bleazby (who later featured in the Australian Broadcasting Commission's popular TV series, Bellbird). Television Henry and Fanny Barbour (Smythe and Minetta Ellen), 1950. By 1949, when television expressed interest, the show focused on the Barbour children. Oldest daughter Hazel had twins, Claudia was rebellious and involved in romances, Claudia's twin brother Cliff had been married three times, and Jack was a 36-year-old father of six daughters, including triplets. One Man's Family had the rare distinction of airing both in prime time and daytime television. The first TV version (November 4, 1949 - June 21, 1952) ran in prime time once a week for a half-hour and reverted the stories back to the 1932 storylines. Hazel was a 28-year-old who yearned for marriage, Cliff and Claudia were students at Stanford University, and Jack was ten years old. The prime time version focused on Fanny's attempts to mediate between her old-world husband and her independent-minded children. The prime time series featured such future stars as Eva Marie Saint (Claudia), Tony Randall (Mac), Mercedes McCambridge (Beth Holly #1), and Frankie Thomas (Cliff Barbour #1). Claudia married daredevil Johnny Roberts (played by Michael Higgins). The show was live, which led to a notorious blooper when Claudia and her father-in-law (Ralph Locke) went to track him down. The characters were in an airplane when Locke forget his lines. After a few moments, he yelled at Saint, \\"Well, if you can't say anything, I'm leaving!\\" and walked off the set, in spite of his character being in the middle of a flight! Lest viewers presume the character had killed himself, Locke was in his seat the following day. The theme music was \\"Journey into Melody.\\" The daytime show (March 1, 1954 - April 1, 1955) carried many of the same storylines as the prime time version but with a different cast. Anne Whitfield, who played Claudia's daughter Penelope on the radio version, simultaneously played Claudia on the TV show. It also had different theme music, \\"Deserted Mansion.\\" All versions of the show were written, cast, produced and directed by Carlton E. Morse. In 1965, General Foods offered to sponsor another version of One Man's Family on NBC, but NBC passed and picked up Days of Our Lives instead.

The point of the grubber is to make the ball roll and tumble across the ground, making it hard for the defending team to pick up the ball without causing a knock-on. Its properties make it hard to handle, giving it both high and low bouncing. On random occasions, the ball can uncannily sit up in a perfect catching position. Rugby football It is commonly practised in games derived from rugby football: rugby league and rugby union. In league, the grubber is usually executed when close to the opposition's line as an attacking play - grubbering into the ingoal. It can produce irregular bounces making it difficult for the opposing team to secure possession. Australian rules football The kick is rare in Australian rules football, usually seen only in rushed, close proximity shots for goal. In recent times, rules players have practised techniques which use the unpredictable bounce of the ball to curve it towards goal, making it possible to kick goals from seemingly impossible angles (see also Checkside punt). A fast kick close to or along the ground in Australian rules football is sometimes also referred to as a worm burner. These kicks are often used to prevent an opposition player from marking the ball. Execution To execute a grubber, the ball is held on each side in an upright position slightly tilted toward the body. The kicker leans toward the ball, with their head and eyes over the ball. The release and the contact with the ball is the most important aspect and the most defining feature of the execution from other kicks. Contact is made with a slight bend in the knee on the upper half of the ball, before it makes contact with the ground. The follow through is with a straight leg and results in the ball moving along the ground.

Ordinary Japanese rice, or uruchimai (Á≤≥Á±≥), is the staple of the Japanese diet and consists of short translucent grains. When cooked, it has a sticky texture such that it can easily be picked up and eaten with chopsticks. Outside Japan it is sometimes labeled sushi rice, as this is one of its common uses. It is also used to produce sake. Glutinous rice, known in Japan as mochigome („ÇÇ„Å°Á±≥), is used for making mochi (È§Ö) and special dishes such as sekihan. It is a short- grain rice, and can be distinguished from uruchimai by its particularly short, round, opaque grains, its greater stickiness when cooked, and firmer and chewier texture. Cultivation Contemporary cultivation of rice in Japan is characterized by high mechanization, intense cultivation, and a shortage of farmland. Terraced rice fields cover many rural hillsides and are relatively small due to mountainous terrain and government controls on farmland consolidation. Cultivars A comparison between Koshihikari and Calrose cultivars. Koshihikari on the left, Calrose on the right. Koshihikari („Ç≥„Ç∑„Éí„Ç´„É™) is a particularly esteemed cultivar and one of the most commonly grown in Japan. Akitakomachi is also quite popular. Sasanishiki is a cultivar known for keeping the same taste when cooled down. Yamada Nishiki is the most famous cultivar grown specifically for sake. In Hokkaid≈ç, Japan's northernmost prefecture, hardier cultivars such as Oborozuki and Yumepirika have been developed to withstand the colder climate. Calrose is the name used originally for a medium-grain Japonica cultivar developed in 1948, and now as a generic term for California medium grain Japonicas. While not true Japanese rice, Calrose-type rice has been grown by Japanese American producers in California for many years. It is commonly used to prepare Japanese cuisine in North America, and is reasonably good as a sushi rice. It is also exported to a number of countries including Japan, although it has not gained much popularity with Japanese consumers. In recent years, Koshihikari rice is also being grown in the US and Australia. Processing Rice begins as brown rice, genmai (ÁéÑÁ±≥), which may then be polished by a machine (Á≤æÁ±≥Ê©ü seimaiki), in which case it is sold as ready-polished or white rice, hakumai (ÁôΩÁ±≥). Most rice in Japan is processed and consumed as white rice, the staple food of Japan. Brown rice is also consumed in its unpolished state, often for its health benefits, but it is considered a specialty. Hatsuga genmai (Áô∫ËäΩÁéÑÁ±≥) is brown rice that has been soaked in heated water until germinated. It is also known as GABA rice, as the germination process greatly increases its gamma-Aminobutyric acid content. It has a softer texture than ordinary brown rice and a pleasant fragrance. It is sold in Japanese supermarkets, but it can also be made at home. Some high-end rice cookers have a GABA rice setting to automate the process. Haigamai is rice that has been partially milled to remove most of the bran but leave the germ intact. It takes less time to cook than brown rice but retains more of the vitamins than white rice. Coin-operated automated rice polishing machines, called seimaijo (Á≤æÁ±≥ÊâÄ), for polishing brown rice, are a common sight in rural Japan. The rice polishing machines typically polish a 10 kg amount for 100 yen. The by-product of the polishing process, rice bran (Á±≥„Å¨„Åã komenuka) is used commercially as the source of rice bran oil. It may also be used for making a kind of pickle called nukazuke („Å¨„Åã„Å•„Åë), as an organic fertilizer, and in livestock feed. Most supermarkets in Japan sell ready- polished rice in 10 kg, 5 kg, and smaller bags. Brown rice is usually sold in 30 kg bags, which may be generally polished by the consumer in a coin-operated polishing machine, or in smaller bags in supermarkets intended for eating as brown rice. Musenmai (ÁÑ°Ê¥óÁ±≥), or no-wash rice, is white rice which has been further processed to remove a sticky coating called the hada nuka (ËÇåÁ≥†), or skin bran, which normally must be removed by rinsing the rice prior to cooking. The manufacturing process involves tumbling the rice in a tube for a short duration, causing the bran to stick to the sides of the tube. Uses Sushi by Hiroshige in Edo period Rice cooker of the Edo period Fukagawa Edo Museum Ordinary rice, or uruchimai, is eaten in several ways in Japan, most commonly as plain rice consumed as part of a typical washoku meal accompanied by several okazu dishes („Åä„Åã„Åö), tsukemono (various pickles), and miso soup. In bento boxes it is often served with a topping of furikake („Åµ„Çä„Åã„Åë), a single umeboshi, or a sheet of nori (Êµ∑Ëãî). It is used in sushi (ÂØøÂè∏) and onigiri. Examples of simple breakfast dishes include plain rice mixed with raw egg and optional soy sauce, known as tamago kake gohan, and plain rice with natt≈ç. Plain rice is used in y≈çshoku dishes such as curry rice, omurice, and doria. Leftover plain rice is often reused as ochazuke (Ëå∂Êº¨„Åë) (rice with green tea) or chƒÅhan („ÉÅ„É£„Éº„Éè„É≥) (fried rice). Takikomi gohan is made with ordinary rice which is cooked together with vegetables, meat, or fish seasoned with dashi and soy sauce. Uruchimai is also used to make alcoholic drinks like sake (Êó•Êú¨ÈÖí), and sometimes shochu, as an adjunct in Japanese beer, and to make rice vinegar. Uncooked brown rice grains are mixed with green tea leaves and used to brew a kind of tea called Genmaicha (ÁéÑÁ±≥Ëå∂) (brown rice tea). Glutinous rice, known in Japan as mochigome, is used for making mochi (È§Ö), the festive red bean and rice dish sekihan, as well as traditional snacks such as senbei (ÁÖéÈ§Ö), arare („ÅÇ„Çâ„Çå), and agemochi (Êèö„ÅíÈ§Ö). =Preparation= Most Japanese use suihanki (rice cookers) to which measured amounts of washed rice and water are added. The rice is first washed to release excess starch. Then, before cooking it is usually soaked in water for between half an hour in summer, and two hours in winter. Soaking times also depend on the quality and freshness of the rice. The rice is then boiled using a ratio of about five parts of water to four parts of rice ‚Äì though with fresher rice, the ratio can go down to 1-to-1. After this, it is steamed until the centre of the rice becomes soft. Salt is not added to the rice. Most modern rice cookers include a cooking-delay timer, so that rice placed in the cooker at night will be ready for the morning meal. The rice cooker can also keep rice moist and warm, allowing it to remain edible for several hours after cooking. Prepared rice is usually served from the rice cooker into a chawan, or rice bowl. After cooking, rice may also be held in a covered wooden box called an ohitsu. Trading The Dojima Rice Market in Osaka was the first known futures market, with trading in rice contracts established sometime around 1730. This market ceased with economic controls in 1939. In 2005, the Tokyo Grain Exchange announced that it would create a futures contract on rice with trading starting in the summer of 2006. However, the trading of these futures contracts has been postponed to an unspecified date since it has not been approved by the Japanese government. The Tokyo Grain Exchange was founded in 1952 in the same location as the Kakigaracho Rice Trading Exchange, established in 1874. As of 2005, two varieties of Japanese rice were in consideration for standardization of the contract. In order to fulfill self-sufficiency goals in Japan and to support domestic rice producers, the Japanese government enforces quotas and high tariffs on foreign rice. As a result, most rice consumed in Japan is domestically produced. However, price increases in recent years have led a small but increasing number of Japanese consumers and restaurants to seek out the small amount of less-expensive rice imported from China, Australia, and the United States that is available in Japan.

Previous entries, including the 1911 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, confused him with Richard Curwen, almoner to Henry VIII. Life Born in Bampton, Cumbria, he is thought to have been educated at Brasenose College, Oxford. He had at least two brothers, Christopher and James, who was grandfather of Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury and 'overseer' of the King James Bible. Career His grandnephew Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury and 'overseer' of the King James Bible In February 1528, Curwen gained a degree in Canon law, followed by a Master of Arts in 1532. In 1533, he was appointed Rector in the village of Ferriby, Lincolnshire. The following year, England broke with the Catholic Church and formed the Church of England, led by Henry VIII, rather than the Pope. In 1541, he became dean of Hereford, followed by a series of administrative posts; when Mary became queen in 1555, he conformed with the restoration of Catholicism. Nominated Roman Catholic Archbishopric of Dublin, he was consecrated on 8 September 1555 by Edmund Bonner. He was also appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and in 1557 served as Lord Justice of Ireland during the absence of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Earl of Sussex. When Elizabeth succeeded in 1558, only five Irish bishops accepted the Religious Settlement, Curwen being one of them. He remained Archbishop and Lord Chancellor until 1567, but was accused of 'moral delinquency' by Hugh Brady and Adam Loftus, apparently for his reluctance to implement reforms. Curwen suffered from palsy and poor health made it increasingly difficult to continue his duties; in 1564, he obtained a sinecure position for his nephew Richard Bancroft at St Patrick's, Dublin. Apparently 'speechless and senseless', he was finally allowed to resign in June 1567, when he became Bishop of Oxford. He died at his home in Swinbrook in October 1568, and buried at St John the Baptist, Burford. The diocese of Oxford remained vacant until 1589, when John Underhill became bishop.

England, Wales and Northern Ireland The custos rotulorum is the keeper of an English, Welsh and Northern Irish county's records and, by virtue of that office, the highest civil officer in the county. The position is now largely ceremonial. The appointment until 1545, lay with the Lord Chancellor, but is now exercised by the Crown, under the Royal sign-manual, and was usually held by a person of rank. The appointment has been united with that of the lord-lieutenancy of the county throughout England since 1836. The custos rotulorum of Lancashire was formerly appointed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and that of County Durham vested in the Bishop of Durham until the abolition of its palatine rights. Traditionally, he was one of the justices of the peace. The custos rotulorum of the Isle of Ely remained the Bishop of Ely until the 'Liberty of Ely Act 1837'. In practice, the records were in the custody of the clerk of the peace. This latter official was, until 1888, appointed by the custos rotulorum, but following the passing of the Local Government Act of that year, the appointment was made by the standing joint-committee of the county council. The post of clerk of the peace was abolished by the Courts Act 1971. William Lambarde (1536‚Äì1601) described the custos rotulorum as a man chosen for his wisdom, countenance or credit. Ireland The role of custos rotulorum was also adopted in the Kingdom of Ireland, usually abbreviated as the post- nominal \\"CoRo\\". From 1831 the title passed to the pre-existing Lord Lieutenant of every county as office-holder, and from then the List of Lords Lieutenant of County Dublin corresponded with the Custos Rotulorum of Dublin. Custodes rotulorum were abolished by the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. In 1922 the creation of the Irish Free State resulted in the abolition of the by then largely honorific posts, but Lord Lieutenancies are still retained in Northern Ireland. Jamaica =History= The Office of the Custos evolved in Jamaica from its colonial past. It can be traced back to fourteenth-century England when in 1391 King Richard II issued the Grand Commission appointing Custodes and Justices of the Peace to assist in maintaining law and order in the counties. In Jamaica the first mention of the office appears in Legislative Council Minutes of 28 July 1668 in an ordinance dealing with the 'Orderly Proceedings of the Courts' within the island. The holder of the Office of Custos was described as the first citizen of the parish appointed by the Governor as his representative to assist in the maintenance of good order and discipline in the parish, and upholding the rule of law. The first Custos mentioned by name was Henry Morgan as the Custos of Port Royal during the Governorship of the Earl of Carlisle in 1680. The Custos Rotulorum or Keeper of the Roll of the Justices of the Peace must be a Justice of the Peace and have dealt with such minor criminal charges as are within his jurisdiction. The duties and powers of the Custos at various times have included: * to preside at Petty Sessions Court and be the Chief Magistrate for the parish. * to receive the Sovereign, any representative of the royal family, His Excellency The Governor as representing the sovereign when within the precincts of the parish. * to recommend to the Governor from time to time ‚Äògentlemen' for commission as Justices as the parish required. * to be an ex- officio member of the Parochial Board. In this capacity he could exercise very beneficial influence. He was required to attend the meetings of the Board as often as possible. * to visit from time to time the hospitals, poorhouses and other institutions, including every prison in the parish, and to discover any abuse therein and report the same to the Governor. This was aimed at ensuring that the affairs of these institutions were conducted properly. * except in the parish of Kingston, to appoint one or more polling places at all elections and one or more persons to keep the poll at the elections of the Vestrymen (now Parish Councillors) and the Church Wardens (that is the Church of England or Anglican denomination). * to be the chairman of the Board of Highways and Bridges in the parish. =Appointment and duties= Ministry Paper Numbered 2, Appendix I, approved by Parliament on the 5th day of July 1959 and gazetted on the 5th day of February 1963 outlined that there shall be a Custos Rotulorum for every parish in Jamaica. The Custos shall be appointed by the Governor- General acting on the advice of the Prime Minister and shall be a resident of the parish to which he is appointed, save in the case of the Corporate Area.

Lucius Papirius Mugillanus Cursor (c.365‚Äìafter 310 BC) was a celebrated politician and general of the early Roman Republic, who was five times consul, three times magister equitum, and twice dictator. He was the most important Roman commander during the Second Samnite War (327‚Äì304 BC), during which he received three triumphs. He was a member of the patrician gens Papiria of ancient Rome. Cursor's strictness was proverbial; he was a man of immense bodily strength, while his bravery was beyond dispute. He was given the cognomen Cursor Latin: cursor (‚Äúrunner‚Äù) from curr≈ç (‚Äúrun‚Äù) + -or (agentive suffix) from his swiftness of foot.Aurelius Victor, De viris illustribus, 3 Most of what is known of Cursor's life comes from the monumental History of Rome written by Livy during the time of Augustus. Livy portrayed Cursor as an invincible hero, who avenged the humiliation of the Caudine Forks in 321 BC, when the Roman army had to pass under the yoke. In a famous digression, he even wrote that had Alexander the Great turned his army against Rome, he would have met his match with Cursor. With this narrative, Livy participated in the Roman propaganda sponsored by Augustus, which idealised several figures of the first part of the Republic.  Family background  Cursor belonged to the patrician gens Papiria. The first Papirii of importance were Gaius and Manius Papirius, respectively the first Pontifex Maximus and Rex Sacrorum of the Republic in 509.Broughton, vol. I, p. 4. However, there is some doubt of the authenticity of these offices, as they could have been invented by a later Papirius to enhance the prestige of his family.R√ºpke, Fasti Sacerdotum, p. 826, who suggests the Papirius in question was Gaius Papirius Maso, pontifex in the middle of the 3rd century. The Papirii were one of the last patrician gentes to reach the consulship, with Lucius Papirius Mugillanus, only elected in 444.Broughton, vol. I, p. 53.Forsythe, Critical History of Early Rome, p. 166. Cursor's grandfather was censor in 393, then consular tribune in 387 and 385.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 91, 99, 101. Livy gives this man the cognomen Cursor, the first time it appears in history, but in a later statement says that the cognomen Cursor was first bestowed to his grandson because of his running speed.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. I, pp. 437, 438. It is therefore more likely that the cognomen of Cursor's grandfather was Mugillanus, the most important branch of the Papirii in the 5th and 4th centuries, because Cursor himself is sometimes called Mugillanus in ancient sources. The structure of Roman names was fluid at the time, and several contemporary changes of cognomen are recorded, such as Appius Claudius Caecus, initially named Crassus. Likewise, Cursor's initial name was probably Mugillanus.M√ºnzer, RE, vol. 36, tome 2, pp. 1040, 1041.Etcheto, \\"Cognomen et appartenance familiale\\", p. 462.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. I, pp. 437, 438; vol. II, p. 664; vol. IV, p. 578. Oakley initially stated that the problem of Cursor's cognomen was \\"insoluble\\", but in his following volumes he accepts M√ºnzer's theory that his initial cognomen was likely Mugillanus. Cursor's father was named Spurius, but nothing is known on his life.M√ºnzer, RE, vol. 36, tome 2, p. 1040. Robert Develin suggests that Cursor was born circa 365.Develin, Patterns in Office-Holding, p. 62.  Career  = Magister equitum (340 BC) = The first mention of Cursor in history took place in 340 with his appointment as Magister equitum by his cousin, the dictator Lucius Papirius Crassus.Broughton, vol. I, p. 136.Brennan, The Praetorship, p. 73. The reason for the appointment of a dictator was the death of the consul Publius Decius Mus while fighting the Latins, and the illness of the other, the famous Titus Manlius Torquatus. Since 341 Rome was waging the Latin War against its former Latin allies.Tim Cornell, Cambridge Ancient History, vol. VII part 2, pp. 360, 361. Livy says that an army from the city of Antium was operating in southern Latium, which the dictator Crassus was supposed to repel, but he did not engage them.Livy, viii. 12. However, modern historians reject most of the details told by Livy on this war, as he made several anachronisms derived from the Social War of 91‚Äì87 BC.Cornell, Beginnings of Rome, p. 348.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. II, p. 517, accepts the historicity of this dictatorship. = Praetor (332 BC) = Map of the Settlement made by Rome with Latin and Italian communities after the Latin War, including Acerrae. In 332, Cursor might have been the praetor who passed the law granting half-citizenship to the city of Acerrae in Campania, 16 km northeast of Naples.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. II, p. 593. Called lex Papiria de civitate Acerranorum, it is the oldest known law passed by a praetor.Graeber, Auctoritas patrum, p. 45. However, it is also possible that this man, only named \\"Lucius Papirius\\" by Livy,Livy, viii. 17. was the dictator of 340, or the future censor of 318, both named Lucius Papirius Crassus.Broughton, vol. I, p. 142 (note 2), favours one of the two Crassi.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. I, p. 50, makes Cursor the praetor for 332.Brennan, The Praetorship, pp. 725, 894, does not make a choice among the three possibilities. After its victory at the end of the Latin War, Rome overhauled its relationships with the cities under its domination, by using a range of different statuses. Campanian cities were given half-citizenship, called civitas sine suffragio (\\"citizenship without suffrage\\").Cornell, Beginnings of Rome, pp. 349‚Äì351. This policy was likely inspired by Quintus Publilius Philo, who was the leading proponent of the Roman expansion towards Campania, and also seating censor in 332.Staveley, \\"The political aims of Appius Claudius Caecus\\", p. 426. = Consul I (326 BC) = Cursor was elected consul in 326, alongside the plebeian Gaius Poetelius Libo Visolus, who was the consul prior, which means the Centuriate Assembly elected him before Cursor.Taylor & Broughton, \\"The Order of the Two Consuls' Names\\", p. 6.Broughton, vol. I, p. 136. Some sources make Poetelius the same as the man who was already consul in 360 and 346,Broughton, vol. I, pp. 120, 131. but such a gap is improbable and Cursor's colleague was more likely his son.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. II, pp. 149, 150. The elections for 326 were subject to an intense political battle related to the Struggle of the Orders‚Äîthe plebeians' campaign to obtain equal rights with the patricians, which took place during the fourth century. Livy indeed records 14 successive interreges before that of Lucius Aemilius Mamercinus Privernas, who finally presided over the election of Poetelius and Cursor.Livy, viii. 23. An interrex was traditionally appointed to hold the elections when the consuls were unavailable. In this case, the consul Publilius Philo, who was besieging Neapolis and could not come back to Rome, appointed a dictator‚ÄîMarcus Claudius Marcellus‚Äîto supervise the election, but as he was plebeian, the college of augurs, exclusively patrician at the time, found that Marcellus had been faultily appointed and forced his resignation. Interreges were always patrician, so the augurs' opposition was doubtless a political manoeuvre to prevent a plebeian from holding the elections. They served for up to five days and were replaced if they could not succeed in holding the elections. Since there were fifteen interreges, it means that the political struggle lasted for at least 70 days.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. II, pp. 661, 662, who says that Livy's story \\"seems wholly credible\\". It is not known how much Aemilius Privernas influenced the elections and his links with Cursor and Poetelius, but M√ºnzer supposed he was an ally of Publilius Philo and a member of a Centre Party headed by the Aemilii, who supported the demands of the plebeian elite.M√ºnzer, Roman Aristocratic Parties, pp. 37, 38. Nevertheless, it was the first time that a plebeian (Poetelius) was elected consul prior through an election held by a patrician.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. II, pp. 20, 21. Both consuls held command during the Second Samnite war, which had started the previous year after the Samnites took control of Naples.Salmon, Samnium and the Samnites, p. 218. Livy does not distinguishes the consuls' activity; he says that they captured Allifae (modern Alife), Callifae (perhaps near Pratella), and Rufrium (likely Presenzano). All three cities are located in the valley of the Volturno in northern Campania.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. II, pp. 676, 677. However, the story can be doubted as Livy tells later that Allifae was still under Samnite control.Salmon, Samnium and the Samnites, pp. 219, 220. The main feature of their consulship was the Lex Poetelia Papiria de nexis, which abolished nexum, a form of debt-bondage. = Dictator (325 BC) = The next year, Cursor was appointed dictator by the consul Lucius Furius Camillus because of his sickness that prevented him from leading the army against the Samnites.Salmon, Samnium and the Samnites, p. 6 (note1), thinks this illness is suspect as it could have been an invention by a later annalist. Cursor in turn chose Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus as his magister equitum.Broughton, vol. I, p. 147. The Second Samnite War started in 326 after Rome had founded a colony in Fregellae in 328, which was located in Campania, under Samnite control. This war was a deliberate aggression from Rome, under the push of a group of aristocrats championing expansion into Campania.Salmon, Samnium and the Samnites, pp. 217, 218. In 325 BC he was appointed dictator to carry on the second Samnite War. His quarrel with Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, his magister equitum, is well known. The latter had engaged the enemy against the orders of Cursor, by whom he was condemned to death, and only the intercession of his father, the senate, and the people saved his life. At the end of his dictatorship, Cursor vowed the construction of the Temple of Quirinus, which was finally dedicated by his son during his first consulship on 17 February 293. The temple was built on the top of the Quirinal Hill, east of the current Palazzo Barberini. The reason for the long delay (32 years) was possibly that the construction had to be funded by Cursor and also because his son waited until he became consul to make the dedication. This ceremony could only be summoned by a magistrate with imperium. The vowing of a temple to Quirinus by Cursor was the first time in Roman history that an individual pledged to build a temple on private money alone. The few temples built before were funded by the state, but Cursor's example was rapidly followed by many others in the third century, thanks to the rapid conquest of Italy by the Republic, which brought considerable booty.Ziolkowski, The Temples of Mid-Republican Rome, pp. 139‚Äì144, 239‚Äì243, 247, 307‚Äì310. = Consul II (320 BC) = Cursor was elected consul a second time in 320, together with the plebeian Quintus Publilius Philo, consul for the third time. Livy states explicitly that Philo was the consul prior and Cursor posterior, but the Fasti Capitolini reverse the consuls' order and give Cursor the first place. The Fasti were made under Augustus by the College of Pontiffs, whose members often moved their ancestors to first place in order to enhance the prestige of their family‚Äîa policy supported by Augustus who tried to revive several prominent patrician gentes‚Äîsince being elected prior was the subject of great pride.Taylor & Broughton, \\"Order of the Consuls' Names\\", p. 166. Conversely, they moved to second place some men that had repeated consulships, such as Philo, to avoid the comparison with Augustus, who continuously held the consulship between 31 and 23 BC.Taylor, \\"Augustan Editing\\", pp. 75, 78 (note 7), 79 (notes 11, 21). The election of both consuls broke the Lex Genucia, passed in 342, which theoretically forbade iteration of a magistracy within ten years. Cursor had been consul in 326, and Philo in 327. However, Corey Brennan suggests that this law only forbade iteration within ten years, so it had lapsed by 332.Brennan, The Praetorship, pp. 65‚Äì67.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. IV, p. 543, writes that Brennan's \\"argument [...] has considerable force, but the standard view remains defensible.\\" Philo is the only securely attested political ally of Cursor, as they are found together in office several times, and they likely ran in the elections together in a political ticket. This pattern of a patrician and a plebeian repeatedly sharing the consulship or other magistracies is a feature of Roman politics in the middle Republic, and multiple instances are known, including that of Cursor's son, who shared the consulship twice with Spurius Carvilius Maximus.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 180, 197.Forsythe, Critical History of Early Rome, p. 269. After the disaster of the Caudine Forks, Cursor to some extent wiped out the disgrace by compelling Lucera (which had revolted) to surrender. He delivered the Roman hostages who were held in captivity in the town, recovered the standards lost at Caudium, and made 7,000 of the enemy pass under the yoke. = Consul III (319 BC) = Cursor was reelected consul in 319, this time as consul prior, with the plebeian Quintus Aulius Cerretanus, who had already been consul in 323.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 149, 154. = Consul IV (315 BC) = In 315, Cursor was elected to a fourth consulship, alongside his former colleague Publilius Philo, again as consul prior.Broughton, vol. I, p. 156. = Consul V (313 BC) = In 313, Cursor was elected consul prior alongside the plebeian Gaius Junius Bubulcus Brutus, who had already been consul in 317.Broughton, vol. I, p. 158. = Dictator (310 BC) = The final mention of Cursor in the sources took place in 310, when he was appointed dictator for the second time. He in turn appointed as magister equitum his former colleague Bubulcus Brutus.Broughton, vol. I, p. 162. In 310 BC, when the Samnites again rose, Cursor was appointed dictator for the second time, and gained a decisive victory at Longula, in honour of which he celebrated a magnificent triumph. Cursor displayed the weapons captured from the Samnites in the triumphal procession, during which Livy tells that the Samnite gold-plated shields made a strong impression.Livy, ix. 40. As a result, he gave them to the silversmiths on the Forum, in order to decorate the tabernae with enemy's spoils. This practice of publicly displaying enemy spoils was new at the time in Rome, and was inspired from the Greeks.Bastien, Le triomphe romain, pp. 158, 159, who cites the example of Alexander the Great displaying Persian armours on the Parthenon after the Battle of the Granicus. Livy adds that from this point on aediles regularly decorated the Forum for the Ludi Romani after the precedent set by Cursor.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. III, pp. 521‚Äì524. Several modern historians have nevertheless cast some doubts on the whole event, as many features of both the battle and its subsequent triumph closely resemble the later triumph of Cursor's son in 293, likewise against the Samnites.Oakley, Commentary on Livy, vol. III, pp. 504‚Äì508. His cognomen, Cursor, means \\"The Runner\\", as he was able to walk over 50 Roman miles a day in full marching order and demanded the same from his soldiers. Legend says that when cavalry veterans came to him asking for some privileges, he gave them but one privilege: Such harshness to his soldiers allowed them to be defeated initially. But later he had regained their good- will by more lenient treatment and lavish promises of booty; they fought with enthusiasm and gained a complete victory. His son of the same name, also a distinguished general, completed the subjection of Samnium (272 BC). He set up a sundial, the first of its kind in Rome, in the temple of Quirinus.Livy x. 39‚Äì47; viii., ix. Pliny, Nat. Hist., vii. 60. Eutropius ii. 8. 9. Legacy = Comparison with Alexander the Great = In the 9th book of his Ab Urbe Condita, Livy made a much-discussed disgression on Alexander the Great, who had died a few years before the events he describes. He says that Rome would have been able to withstand an attack from Alexander if he had attempted to conquer the West. This passage comes just after he drew a panegyric of Cursor, and both men are implicitly compared. The disgression may originate from the real fear at the time in Rome of a Greek invasion of Italy. During the Pyrrhic War, Appius Caecus made a famous speech‚Äîthe first ever recorded in Rome‚Äîin which he mentions this possibility. = In the Hall of Fame (2 BC) = In 2 BC, Augustus finished the construction of a new Forum around the Temple of Mars Ultor.Geiger, Hall of Fame, p. 60. On either side of the forum were two galleries of marble statues; on the northeastern side he placed the statues of his ancestors and other members of his family, starting with Aeneas; on the southwestern side he placed a gallery of heroes, dubbed a \\"Hall of Fame\\", starting with Romulus, the first Roman king. Each statue had an elogium, a plaque telling the deeds of the man portrayed.Geiger, Hall of Fame, p. 61. It is possible that Augustus was inspired by Virgil's Aeneid and Livy's Ab Urbe Condita‚Äîthe two most important literary works of his reign‚Äîwhen making his choice of statues.T. J. Luce, \\"Livy, Augustus, and the Forum Augustum\\", in Raaflaub & Toher (eds.), Between Republic and Empire, pp. 123‚Äì38. Luce writes that Augustus used a different source for the biographical details on the heroes, because they differ a lot from Livy's story. He nonetheless notes that Cursor's elogium matches Livy's record (p. 130, note 23).Geiger, Hall of Fame, p. 63. Cursor logically features among the list of heroes, and his elogium his partially preserved.Geiger, Hall of Fame, pp. 141, 142. The surviving part tells about the quarel with Rullianus.

Schedel told about his quarrel with Rullianus.Schedel, Nuremberg Chronicle, f. lxxix r. Named Lucio Papirio or Lucio Papirio dittatore, he is the subject of several Baroque operas. The Dutch Golden Age painter Gerard De Lairesse pictured the famous story of Cursor's quarrel with Fabius Maximus Rullianus in 1688.

The King was surprised by the behavioural change in the fox. So, he thought that this place must have something which made the fleeing fox change attitude.

Fry, oil on canvas painting by Kenyon Cox, 1883, Cincinnati Art MuseumAugustus Saint-Gaudens at the Met in New York, 1908 Kenyon Cox (October 27, 1856 ‚Äì March 17, 1919) was an American painter, illustrator, muralist, writer, and teacher. Cox was an influential and important early instructor at the Art Students League of New York. He was the designer of the League's logo, whose motto is Nulla Dies Sine Linea or No Day Without a Line. Biography He was born in Warren, Ohio, the son of Jacob Dolson Cox and Helen Finney Cox. As a young adult, Cox studied art at Cincinnati's Art Academy of Cincinnati (formerly known as the McMicken School of Art), but soon became aware of the lack of opportunity and artistic presence in Cincinnati. After visiting the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Kenyon decided that Philadelphia and the art academy there had much more to offer him than Cincinnati did. Kenyon enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts hoping to receive better instruction and eventually secure for himself a way to study in Europe.Cox, Kenyon. An Artist of the American Renaissance: The Letters of Kenyon Cox,1883-1919. Ed. Wayne H. Morgan. Kent, Ohio: Kent State UP, 1995. =Paris and travels= In 1877 Cox moved to Paris like many American artists of the day to be a part of what he believed to be a sort of second renaissance in art. There he studied under Carolus-Duran and Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me and then under Alexandre Cabanel at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Cox wrote of his initial impression of Paris saying that there was \\"so much artistic material here that one might almost be content to stay here and paint for years‚Ä¶One can't dive down a crooked street or turn a sharp corner without finding more to paint than he could by hunting months for a subject in America. If Paris is at all like this it must indeed be a paradise for artists.\\" Cox first studied under Carolus-Duran. Soon after, Cox began to get irritated with Duran. During the winter of 1877-78 Cox wrote to his father about Duran stating that, \\"I appreciate his strong color, breadth, etc., etc. But I thought you would like to know just how he impressed me, and I must say that a predominating vulgarity grates on me.\\" Soon after writing this, Cox left the instruction of Carolus-Duran and enrolled in the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. His painting teachers at the school included Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, Alexandre Cabanel and Henri Lehmann. While in Europe, Cox took the opportunity to travel throughout France and Italy and see the works of the Renaissance Masters. Later he wrote of his travels saying, \\"The trip, I think, did more to broaden and define my notions of art than anything that ever happened to me before.\\" =New York= In 1882 Cox left Paris and moved to New York where he continued to paint. He also began to do many illustrations, mostly to pay the bills. Kenyon became well established as a magazine illustrator. His illustrations reached a much wider audience than did his paintings. Cox also began to write art criticisms (unsigned) for the New York Evening Post. This and other writing jobs took Kenyon's time away from painting but also helped him make a living. Cox continued to live and work in New York for most of his life. He became an influential and important teacher at the Art Students League of New York. Cox designed the League's logo that reads Nulla Dies Sine Linea or No Day Without a Line. In 1900 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician, and became a full Academician in 1903. Cox was one of the founders and the secretary of the National Free Arts League, and was a member of the Society of American Artists, the National Academy of Design, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters and served as President of the National Society of Mural Painters from 1915 to 1919. =A Student's Memory= Kenyon made deep marks in the lives and careers of his students, who included Philadelphia-based painter Margaretta S. Hinchman and artist Jerome Myers, who studied with Cox during his early years of training at the Art Student's League. Though Myers later took a very different path in his own artistic work, he clearly recalled this teacher in his 1940 autobiography, \\"Artist In Manhattan.\\"Jerome Myers, Artist in Manhattan, New York: American Artists Group, Inc. 1940. written by the painter-writer Jerome Myers =Artistic theory= Nude study in graphite; preparatory drawing for the allegorical figure of Romance in The Arts mural at the Library of Congress Jefferson Building. Drawing created 1896, digitally restored. Cox's art was very different from the cubist, neo-impressionist, fauvist, expressionist and modernist styles that emerged during his lifetime. He advocated careful drawing and modulated color, and he frequently used allegory and symbolism to present his ideas. Kenyon Cox painted in the realistic manner and earned a reputation for landscapes, portraits and genre studies. His idealized nudes and traditional treatment of classical themes had little in common with the popular avant-garde art of the day. Later, in 1912, Cox wrote an article for The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin called \\"Two Ways of Painting\\". In this article he describes the difference between the figurative art he was making and the more fashionable abstract art or representational art. In the article he tells of the prejudice he felt as a more traditional figurative artist: > The pressure to conformity is upon the other side and it is the older > methods that need justification and explanation. The prejudices of the > workers and the writers have gradually and naturally become the prejudices > of at least a part of the public, and it have become necessary to show that > the small minority of artists who still follow the old roads do so, not from > ignorance or stupidity or a stolid conservatism, still less from willful > caprice, but from necessity; because those roads are the only ones that can > lead them where they wish to go.Cox, Kenyon. \\"Two Ways of Painting.\\" The > Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 7 (1912): 205-207. Cox, adamantly loyal to the preservation of the \\"older methods\\", set himself in opposition to modern styles. In his 1917 book Concerning Painting: Considerations Theoretical and Historical, Cox restated his earlier feelings about the \\"Two Ways of Painting\\" saying: > For at least fourteen thousand years, then, from the time of the cavemen to > our own day, painting has been an imitative art, and it seems likely that it > will continue to be so. That it should, within a few years, entirely reverse > its current, and should flow in the opposite direction for thousands of > years to come seems highly improbable, not to say incredible. Yet we are > gravely told that it is about to do this; that, at the hands of its > representative element, reached its final and definite form, and that no > further changes are possible. Henceforth, as long as men live in the world > they are to be satisfied with a non-representative art ‚Äî an art > fundamentally different from that which they have known and practiced and > enjoyed.Cox, Kenyon. Concerning Painting: Considerations Theoretical and > Historical, 1917 Cox tried to persuade the art world and the public to once again appreciate traditional, representational art. His writings on the subject became very popular; however, his art did not. =Murals= Liberty mural design by Kenyon Cox, Wisconsin State Capitol dome interior Kenyon Cox began to focus more on mural painting after the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Cox painted murals in the state capitol buildings of Des Moines, St. Paul and Madison as well as other courthouses, libraries and college buildings.Moore, Sarah J. \\"In Search of an American Iconography: Critical Reaction to the Murals At the Library of Congress.\\" Winterthur Portfolio 25 (1990): 231-239. In 1896-97 Cox painted murals in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Cox also made numerous mosaics for places like the Wisconsin State Capitol building. In 1910 Kenyon Cox was awarded the Medal of Honor for mural painting by the Architectural League. He also served as president of the National Society of Mural Painters from 1915 to 1919. =Poetry= An Eclogue A Blonde Kenyon Cox also began to write more articles and became an art critic for numerous magazines in New York including The Nation, Century and Scribner's. In the summer of 1883 Cox began to write poetry for the public: > She lived in Florence centuries ago, :That lady smiling there. What her name > or rank I do not know‚Äî :I know that she was fair. For some great man ‚Äî his > name, like hers, forgot :And faded from Men's sight‚Äî Loved her ‚Äî he must > have loved her ‚Äî and has wrought :This bust for our delight. Whether he > gained her love or had her scorn :Full happy was his fate. He saw her, heard > her speak; he was not born :Four hundred years too late. The palace throngs > in every room but this ‚Äî :Here I am left alone. Love, there is none to see ‚Äî > I press a kiss :Upon thy lips of stone. This poem was a big success in New York City art circles and earned Cox a great deal of attention. According to Wayne H. Morgan who wrote the book, Kenyon Cox : a Life in American Art 1856-1919, \\"The poem and its Unknown Lady symbolized the need among artists, especially those with classical interests, for intense emotion expressed through acceptable forms, and for the idealization of women.\\" Cox himself painted many idealized women mostly in the form of the classic nude. In 1895 Cox published another poem, \\"The Gospel of Art\\", that summarized his idealism about the artist's role in the intensifying emotion through sacrifice, and on the function of art in culture: > Work thou for pleasure; paint or sing or carve The thing thou lovest, though > the body starve. Who works for glory misses oft the goal; Who works for > money coins his very soul; Work for the work's sake, then, and it may be > That these things shall be added unto thee. In 1904 Cox wrote the book Mixed Beasts where he combined the names of different beasts he believed flowed together to form another name like Bumblebeaver or Kangarooster. He then made up short poems to go with each new beast. In 2005 a new version of Mixed Beasts was released. It still contained most of Cox's original verses but also included input and illustrations by Wallace Edwards.Cox, Kenyon, and Wallace Edwards. Mixed Beasts. Kids Can P, Ltd., 2005. =Marriage= Louise Howland King Cox, 1892. Kenyon Cox wrote his mother, \\"Long before I felt the thrill of love, I knew that she would make the best wife in the world for me if I should love her . . . When love came to add to the friendship and confidence, I felt safe and so we mean to marry as soon as we can.\\" While working in New York, Cox began to teach at the Art Student League. One of his female students, Louise Howland King from San Francisco, caught Cox's eye and they began to correspond outside of class. In an early letter to Louise, Cox tried to convince her to stick with her art writing: \\"We must work for the work's sake. You say you almost forget why you paint at all; well, I have long since satisfied myself that I paint because I cannot help it‚Äîbecause I love the work itself and would rather be a miserably bad painter than a successful man in any other work‚Äîbecause the mere joy of trying and even the excitement of failure are the only true pleasures for me.\\" On June 30, 1892, thirty-six-year-old Cox married twenty-seven-year-old Louise Howland King. The pair executed the murals that decorated the Liberal Arts Building at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago.Smithsonian Archive of American Art. Vers.

Leonard, born in 1894 and named after Leonard Opdycke, was a war hero and had a career in city planning and architecture. Son Allyn, born two years later, became an artist, particularly noted for his mural paintings, and an interior decorator. Daughter Caroline born in 1898 was also a talented artist.Kenyon Cox.

Picture used with kind permission of the Angus Library and Archive, Regent‚Äôs Park College. Samuel Cox (19 April 1826 - 1893) was an English nonconformist divine and Christian universalist, born in London. Biography He was born on 19 April 1826 near London, and educated at a school at Stoke Newington. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed at the London docks, where his father was employed, but on the expiration of his indentures resigned his position and entered the Stepney College to prepare himself for the baptist ministry. After passing the college course and matriculating at London University, Cox became in 1852 pastor of the baptist chapel in St. Paul's Square, Southsea. In 1854. he accepted an invitation to Ryde, Isle of Wight, where he remained till 1859. A disorder in the throat compelled him to desist from preaching, and caused him to turn his attention seriously to literature. He wrote for the Freeman, the organ of the baptists, and occasionally acted as editor, and became a contributor to the Nonconformist, the Christian Spectator, the Quiver, and other religious periodicals. In 1861, he was appointed secretary to the committee for arranging the bicentenary of the ejectment in 1662. But the throat delicacy proved less permanent than had been feared, so that in 1863 he ventured to accept a call to the pastorate of the Mansfield Road baptist chapel, Nottingham, a position he occupied successfully and happily till 1888, when failing health compelled his resignation. He was president of the Baptist Association in 1873 and received the degree of DD from St Andrews in 1882. He retired to Hastings, where he died on 27 March 1893. He was buried in the general cemetery at Nottingham. Family In 1873 he married Eliza Tebbutt of Bluntisham, Huntingdonshire. Assessment Although Cox's ministry was effective and zealous, his chief activity was as a writer. His resumption of ministerial work in 1863 did not interfere with his literary energy, which led to his undertaking in 1875 the editorship of the Expositor. The conception of this monthly magazine was evolved by Cox from his own work as a preacher and writer on the Bible. He was editor till 1884, being responsible for volumes i. to xx., some of which he wrote almost entirely himself. But he gathered round him a distinguished staff, including such men as Drs. Magee, Farrar, Marcus Dods, and Professor Robertson Smith. The influence of the magazine upon religious thought in England can hardly be over-estimated. Its general tendency is perhaps best indicated by a sentence in Cox's own exposition of his aims in the first number : 'Our sole purpose is to expound the scriptures honestly and intelligently by permitting them to explain themselves ; neither thrusting upon them miracles which they do not claim or dogmas to which they lend no support, nor venturing to question the doctrines they obviously teach or the miracles which they plainly affirm.' Cox's services to learning received the re- markable recognition of nearly simultaneous offers from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and St. Andrews Universities of their degree of D.D. Cox accepted in 1882 the offer of the last-named, but found himself compelled after 1884 to resign his editorship because the breadth of his views had become displeasing to the proprietors of the magazine. Works Cox has stated that he was the writer of thirty volumes and the editor of twenty more. Cox had distinct gifts as a biblical expositor and was the founder and first editor of a monthly journal The Expositor (1875-1884). Among the best known of his numerous theological publications are Salvator Mundi: Or, Is Christ the Saviour of All Men? (1877); A Commentary on the Book of Job (1880); and The Larger Hope (1883). Among his more important works are : * 'The Secret of Life: being eight Sermons preached at Nottingham,' London, 1866, 8vo. * 'The Private Letters of St. Paul and St. John. By S. C.,' London, 1867, 8vo. This book, being enthusiastically reviewed by Dr. George Macdonald in the 'Spectator,' was Cox's first success as an author. * 'The Quest of the Chief Good : Expository Lectures on the Book Ecclesiastes. . . . By S. C.,' London, 1868, 8vo ; this was rewritten for the 'Expositor's Bible' and published in 1890 as 'The Book of Ecclesiastes, with a New Translation.' * 'The Resurrection. Twelve Expository Essays on the Fifteenth Chapter of St. Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians,' London, 1869, 8vo. * 'Sermons for my Curates, by T. T. Lynch. Edited by S. C.,' London, 1871, 8vo. * 'An Expositor's Note-Book ; or, Brief Essays on Obscure or Misread Scriptures,' London, 1872, 8vo. * 'Biblical Expositions ; or, Brief Essays on Obscure or Misread Scriptures,' London, 1874, 8vo ; this is 'virtually a second volume' of No. 6. * 'The Pilgrim Psalms, an Exposition of the Songs of Degrees,' London, 1874, 8vo. * 'The Book of Ruth. A Popular Exposition,' London, 1876, 8vo. * 'Expository Essays and Discourses,' London, 1877, 8vo. * 'Salvator Mundi ; or, Is Christ the Saviour of all Men?' London, 1877, 8vo. Of all Cox's works this was the most widely read and the most influential. It was followed in 1883 by a sequel, 'The Larger Hope,' London, 16mo ; in which the author defined his position with regard to universalism, and answered some of his critics. Among counterblasts to Cox's teaching may be mentioned ' The Doctrines of Annihilation and Universalism . . . With critical notes and a Review of \\" Salvator Mundi \\" ' (London, 1881), by Thomas Wood. The postscript of this challenges Cox's impartiality as editor of the 'Expositor,' and affords an instance of the kind of complaints which brought about his resignation. * 'A Commentary on the Book of Job, with a Translation',' London, 1880, 8vo. * 'The Genesis of Evil, and other Sermons, mainly Expository,' London, 1880, 8vo. * 'Balaam : an Exposition and a Study,' London, 1884, 8vo. * 'Miracles: an Argument and a Challenge,' London, 1884, 8vo. * 'Expositions,' London, 1885, 8vo ; this was continued till four volumes were issued. * 'The Bird's Nest and other Sermons for Children of all Ages,' London, 1886, 8vo. This volume occupies a unique position among collections of sermons for children. * 'The House and its Builder, with other Discourses,' London, 1889, 8vo. * 'The Hebrew Twins : a Vindication of God's Ways with Jacob and Esau.

He is married to pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi with whom he has co-led large ensembles since the 1970s. Biography Lew Tabackin at Bach Dancing & Dynamite Society, Half Moon Bay, California, June 3, 1984 Tabackin started learning flute at age 12, followed by tenor saxophone at age 15. He has cited Al Cohn and Coleman Hawkins as influences on saxophone, while his flute role models include classical players such as William Kincaid, Julius Baker, and Jean-Pierre Rampal. Tabackin studied flute at the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music and also studied music with composer Vincent Persichetti. In 1962 he graduated from the Conservatory and after serving with the U.S. Army worked with Tal Farlow. He also worked with Chuck Israels in New York City and a band that included Elvin Jones, Donald Byrd, and Roland Hanna. Later he was a member of The Dick Cavett Show band and The Tonight Show Band with Doc Severinsen. He moved from New York to California with The Tonight Show in 1972. During this time he played with Shelly Manne and Billy Higgins. Tabackin met Toshiko Akiyoshi in 1967 while he was playing in Clark Terry's band and she was invited to sit in for Don Friedman. They formed a quartet in the late 1960s, married in 1969, and in 1973 co-founded the Toshiko Akiyoshi ‚Äì Lew Tabackin Big Band in Los Angeles, which later became the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra featuring Lew Tabackin, playing bebop in Duke Ellington-influenced arrangements and compositions by Akiyoshi. Tabackin was principal soloist for the band from 1973 through 2003. Critic Scott Yanow describes Tabackin as \\"one of the few jazz musicians who has been able to develop completely different musical personalities on two instruments\\", with his forceful hard bop style on sax contrasting with his delicate flute playing.

The first volume was released on March 1, 2006. Part of the manga is still online as a webmanga preview. Captain Nemo is meant to be a sequel to Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.  Plot  The year is 1893, in an alternative time-stream in which Napoleon Bonaparte defeated the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo and then founded an Imperial dynasty. Under the iron grip of Napoleon IV, France has extended its tyrannical rule throughout the world, forging a vast Empire that rivals that of Ancient Rome. Only one man stands in defiance against the Empire, roaming at will beneath the surface of the oceans: Young Captain Nemo and his ragtag crew aboard the Nautilus II. France, however, will not just sit idle as Nemo and his crew roam the seas; they want him hunted down and made an example of so that no others will oppose the French Empire. As such, the Emperor sends his Vice Minister of Security, Monsieur Bertrand Pierpont, aboard Captain Gaucher's ship Invincible to help with the hunt. However, while Captain Gaucher is sure Nemo is behind this, Monsieur Pierpont makes it clear that the official French standpoint is that Nemo is ancient history and no longer exists as he was slain and his Nautilus sunk over twenty years ago. Soon after making this point clear to Captain Gaucher, Monsieur Pierpoint learns that his daughter Camille has stowed away aboard the ship and shows all the signs of a woman that will not be left behind. Her father is less than thrilled with this development and locks his daughter away, seeming more concerned of becoming a laughing-stock than that his daughter is now aboard and quite possibly in danger. Meanwhile, Camille is showing she is rebellious and doesn't like to be kept captive, and even seems to hint at finding the idea of Nemo interesting and possibly romantic, as she sneaked on board to watch her father capture Nemo (whom she calls a \\"terrible pirate\\"). After her being trapped in her cabin for quite some time, Captain Gaucher (who seems to have a history with Camille) frees her with the idea of her sharing a drink with her but Camille has other ideas and works out a way to be free of her cabins, something that once again her father doesn't like and that reminds him of her mother - her \\"willful and stubborn\\" streak. As the hunt continues, Monsieur Pierpoint continues to make it clear he does not believe Nemo exists and agrees with the old stories of that it is merely a sea monster attacking ships and not a miracle ship that can travel under the water. It is after these events and a long journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific that Captain Nemo is finally found, or in reality finds the ones hunting him. He provokes and challenges Captain Gaucher to a duel, killing him via his superior agility and speed. Seeing her father's attempt to cheat and attack Nemo without warning, Camille stops her father from attacking Nemo. During the attack, Sarah Wakely, Nemo's ship's doctor, tries to hit Monsieur Pierpoint with throwing knives for his attempted attack on Nemo and instead hits Camille, who got in the way. Camille falls overboard and Nemo jumps into save her. While this rather bold and daring action seems to get a smile from his first officer, Dan Rutherford, it doesn't seem to please Sarah Wakely. Nemo does end up saving Camille from an untimely death, and to make sure she can have her wounds treated he takes her about the Nautilus, where she wakes up as a \\"free prisoner\\". Meanwhile, back in France, Napoleon IV instructs Admiral Vincent La Rocque, his brutal leader of the Imperial navy, to hunt down and kill Nemo. La Rocque is accompanied on his ship The Horrific by Pierpoint, who has promised his daughter in marriage to La Rocque (should she still be alive). Thus starts the tale of the new Captain Nemo and his crew aboard the Nautilus II, along with Camille Pierpoint, who seems to show signs of liking Nemo (even if she doesn't entirely like the way he views her as a work of art).  Characters  *Nemo :The captain of the Nautilus II and son of the original Captain Nemo. He is calm and collected, chivalrous, fearless. Though he does have a bit of a weakness when it comes to the opposite sex, due to the fact he's had very little exposure to them at sea. Like his father before him, he has sworn never to set foot on land until every man is free from tyranny. *Camille Pierpont :The daughter of a noble family, she is saved by Nemo after falling in the ocean when the Nautilus II attacks the ship sent to sink it. Camille might both become a member of the crew as long as she is a \\"prisoner\\" aboard the Nautilus II and also she might become a love interest for Nemo and a rival for Sarah Wakely. Though it is also possible that Sarah hitting Camille with throwing knives during their first meeting has caused the tension that now exists between the two. *Sarah Wakely :Sarah is the ship's medic aboard the Nautilus II and a lethal shot. She is also a possible rival to Camille for Nemo's affection. However, for some reason she also ended up attacking Camille from the start with throwing knives something that obviously did not sit well with Camille. One important thing to note is that she is the daughter of the infamous killer Jack the Ripper. *Conseil :Nemo's Butler and close friend.

He was nominated for the Filmfare award for Best lyricist a total of 40 times, resulting in 4 wins.  Biography  = Early life = Anand Bakshi (Bakshi Anand Prakash Vaid) was born in Rawalpindi, now in Pakistan, on 21 July 1930. His ancestors were Mohyal Brahmins from Kurree, near Rawalpindi, and had their origins in Kashmir. His mother, Sumitra, died when he was five years old. Bakshi's family migrated to India (Delhi) on 2 October 1947, in the aftermath of the partition, when he was 17 years old. The family arrived in Delhi, via a Dakota aircraft, and then migrated to Pune, then Meerut and settled finally in Delhi. Bakshi was fond of writing poetry since his youth, but he did this mostly as a private hobby. In a 1983 interview with Doordarshan, Bakshi recounted that after his initial studies, he joined the Indian Navy, where due to a paucity of time, he could only write occasionally. He continued to write poetry whenever time permitted, and used his songs and lyrics in local programmes related to his troop. He worked in the Navy for many years and simultaneously tried to market his songs in the Mumbai film world. = Success = Anand Bakshi came to Hindi films to make a name for himself in writing and singing, but ended up becoming more successful in writing lyrics. He got his break writing songs in a Brij Mohan film titled Bhalaa Aadmi (1958), acted by Bhagwan Dada. He wrote four songs in this film. His first song in this film was \\"Dharti Ke Laal Na Kar Itna Malaal\\" which was recorded on 9 Nov 1956. (In his own voice on All India Radio interview) After writing for a few movies from 1956 onwards, he first found success in 1962 with Mehendi Lagi Mere Haath, which was produced by (LimeLight), Music Kalyanji & Anandji, Music Pub-HMV/Saregama. Bakshi later made another mark for himself writing a quawwali for the 1962 film Kala Samundar, the song was \\"Meri Tasveer Lekar Kya Karoge Tm\\". He got his real big breakthroughs in 1965 with Himalay Ki God Mein, and a huge breakthrough again in 1965 with the super-hit film Jab Jab Phool Khile, starring Shashi Kapoor; and yet again in 1967 with the super-hit movie Milan (starring Sunil Dutt). These six hit films within a decade of his entry into films cemented his status as a lyrics writer of immense calibre. Bakshi was preferred lyricist by Rajesh Khanna for films with Rajesh Khanna in lead. He went on to work as a lyricist of over 3500 songs and 638 films in his career. (See Filmography below for films reference, names of the films and their year of censorship.) He got his first break as singer in a film directed by Mohan Kumar ‚Äì Mom Ki Gudiya (1972). The first song he sang was a duet ‚Äì \\"Baaghon mein bahaar aayi hothon pe pukaar aayi\\", along with Lata Mangeshkar, with music composed by Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal. He also sang the solo \\"Main dhoondh raha tha sapnon mein\\" from the same film. He also sang songs in four other films: Sholay (1975), where he sang the quawwali \\"Chand Sa Koi Chehera\\" along with Manna Dey, Kishore Kumar and Bhupinder, (the song was released on vinyl, but not in the feature film); Maha Chor (1976); Charas (1976); and Balika Badhu (1976). Anand Bakshi was widely associated with music composers such as Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal, R D Burman, Kalyanji Anandji, SD Burman, Anu Malik, Rajesh Roshan and Anand-Milind, and his songs have been sung by all the top singers as well as other singers such as Shamshad Begum, Ila Arun, Khursheed Bawra, Amirbai Karnataki, Sudha Malhotra and more. He is known to have worked with more than one generation of music composers. He wrote the first recorded songs of many first time male and female leads who went on to become stars, and also of singers such as Shailendra Singh, Kumar Sanu, Kavita Krishnamurthy etc., and he established himself as a versatile lyricist with the song \\"Dum Maro Dum\\" in the movie Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1972). After this, he wrote memorable lyrics in many movies including Bobby, Amar Prem (1971), Aradhana (1969), Jeene Ki Raah, Mera Gaon Mera Desh, Aaye Din Bahar Ke, Aya Sawan Jhoom Ke, Seeta Aur Geeta, Sholay (1975), Dharam Veer, Nagina, Lamhe, Hum (1991), Mohra (1994), Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Pardes (1997), Heer Raanjha, Dushman (1998), Taal (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Gadar: Ek Prem Katha (2001), and Yaadein (2001). = Death = Late in his life, he suffered from heart and lung disease as a consequence of lifelong smoking. In March 2002, he caught a bacterial infection at Nanavati hospital during a minor heart surgery. He finally died of multiple organ failure on 30 March 2002, 8:00 PM at Mumbai's Nanavati Hospital, at the age of 71. The last released movie with lyrics by Anand Bakshi (after his death) was Mehbooba. At the time of his death in 2002, he was survived by his wife Kamla Mohan Bakshi, his daughter Suman Datt, sons Rajesh Bakshi, Rakesh Bakshi, and daughter Kavita Bali.

Clark specialises in the philosophy of religion and animal rights, writing from a philosophical position that might broadly be described as Christian Platonist. He is the author of twenty books, including The Moral Status of Animals (1977), The Nature of the Beast (1982), Animals and Their Moral Standing (1997), G.K. Chesterton (2006), Philosophical Futures (2011), and Ancient Mediterranean Philosophy (2012), as well as 77 scholarly articles, and chapters in another 109 books.For a summary of Clark's philosophical position, see Hancock, Brannon. \\"From Athens to Jerusalem ,\\" Gifford Lectures, accessed 16 June 2012. He is a former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Applied Philosophy (1990‚Äì2001). Background =Education and career= Clark was born on 30 October 1945 in Luton, Bedfordshire, though the family came originally from Shropshire/Staffordshire. His father, D. A. R. Clark, was an apprentice railway engineer who became a technology teacher, and was later appointed principal of Middlesbrough Technical College, now the University of Teesside, then principal of Nottingham Technical College, now Trent University. His mother, M. K. Clark, was a teacher and the daughter of Samuel Finney. Clark was raised in the Anglican tradition.Hancock, Brannon. \\"Stephen R L Clark\\" , Gifford Lectures, accessed 16 June 2010. After attending Nottingham High School (1956‚Äì1964), he won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford (1964‚Äì1968), graduating with a first-class honours degree in greats (classics) in 1968, followed by a fellowship at All Souls (1968‚Äì1975). He was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1973. Brannon Hancock writes that the philosophers Arthur Prior and Sir Anthony Kenny had a great intellectual influence on Clark at Balliol, while Robin Zaehner was one of his greatest influences at All Souls. After Oxford, he lectured in moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow for nine years, until he was appointed professor of philosophy at Liverpool in 1984. He retired from this post at the end of 2009. He has also been a visiting professor at Vanderbilt University and held an Alan Richardson Fellowship at Durham University. He is married to Gillian Clark, with whom he has three children, Samuel, Alexandra, and Verity. =Lectures= Clark has delivered a number of prestigious lectures, including the 1981‚Äì1982 Gifford Lectures at the University of Glasgow, entitled \\"From Athens to Jerusalem\\", the Stanton Lectures in Philosophy of Religion at the University of Cambridge (1987‚Äì1989), and the Wilde Lectures at the University of Oxford (1990). He has also delivered the Scott Holland Lecture at the University of Liverpool (1992), the Aquinas Lecture at the University of Oxford (1994), the Read Tuckwell Lecture at Bristol University (1994), the Royal Institute of Philosophy Lecture at the University of Durham (1995), and the Aquinas Lecture at the Catholic University of Leuven (2000). Work on animal rights Clark served on the British government's Animal Procedures Committee, a group that advises the Home Secretary on animal testing, from 1998 until 2006. He has also been involved with the Boyd Group, a think tank set up by researchers involved in animal testing, and others who oppose it. Clark argues that the moral basis of humanism ‚Äì that all human beings have equal moral status ‚Äì is now so entrenched, in theory if not in practice, that we fail to consider what a radical idea it used to be. He writes that behind this idea is the notion that human beings are in some way uniquely gifted, perhaps with a share in the divine. This human/non-human divide was promoted to prevent human beings from being treated like animals on some utilitarian calculation, rather than as ends in themselves.Clark, Stephen R. L. \\"A view of animals and how they stand\\" , RSPCA, accessed 16 June 2012. He writes that we now know non-human animals to be much closer to humans than was previously thought, and therefore similar considerations must be extended to them. He highlights the incongruity of modern thinkers being willing to ignore the idea that human beings were made in the image of God, yet unwilling to accept what he argues is the moral conclusion that stems from the rejection of that idea, namely that we ought not to treat non-humans with radically less consideration than we treat humans. He writes: \\"If species differences are only racial differences 'writ large,' and it is plainly wrong to make such racial differences a ground for radically different treatment ... we have to concede that if it is wrong to injure humans it must also be wrong to do identical or very similar injury to non-humans.\\" He argues that \\"[t]his is often all that is meant by the claim that 'animals have rights.'\\" > What our forebears lacked was a full understanding of the extent to which > our welfare depends upon the health of the global ecosystem and the extent > to which our evolutionary cousins can be hurt, harmed and injured in ways > analogous to ourselves. The question before us is not simply \\"how may we > produce the greatest ratio of pleasure to pain\\" (a wholly vacuous program), > nor yet \\"what rights do creatures have before the community formulates > them,\\" but how may we best order the communities (social and global) of > which we are parts? The answer, I believe, must lie in our taking seriously > what we already know, that more matters even to animals than their own plain > or pleasure, and that our survival even as a species depends upon being able > to maintain or create substantial and civil ecosystems at household, civil, > national and global levels.

The unit's aircraft have been hastily sprayed with dark green camouflage paint on the upper surfaces. Nishizawa (flying \\"UI-105\\") and wingman on May 7, 1943. Mitsubishi Zero A6M2 Model 21 ready for takeoff. Lieutenant Junior Grade was an ace of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service during World War II. :He is officially credited in Japan with the following aerial victories: :victories - 36 :damaged - 2 :shared damaged - 49 It is possible that Nishizawa was the most successful Japanese fighter ace of the war; he personally claimed to have had 102 aerial victories at the time of his death. Some uncertainty is due to the Japanese habit of recording victories for pilots' units, rather than the individual, after 1941, as well as the often wildly exaggerated claims of aerial kills that were frequently accepted. Some sources credit Nishizawa with over 120 to 150 victories.Mizrahi, Joseph V., Wings magazine, August, 1986, p.42: \\"... in October 1944. At that ime he had well over 100 victories...\\" His article has no citations.http://acesofww2.com/japan/aces/nishizawa/ Early life Hiroyoshi Nishizawa was born 27 January 1920 in a mountain village in the Nagano Prefecture, the fifth son of Mikiji and Miyoshi Nishizawa. His father was the manager of a sake brewery. Hiroyoshi graduated from higher elementary school and then began to work in a textile factory. In June 1936, a poster caught his eye, an appeal for volunteers to join the Yokaren (flight reserve enlistee training program). Nishizawa applied and qualified as a student pilot in Class Otsu No. 7 of the Japanese Navy Air Force (JNAF). He completed his flight training course in March 1939, graduating 16th out of a class of 71. Before the war, he served with the Oita, Omura and Suzuka K≈çk≈´tai (air groups/wings). In October 1941, he was transferred to the Chitose K≈çk≈´tai, with the rank of petty officer 1st class. World War II =New Guinea= After the outbreak of war with the Allies, Nishizawa's squadron (chutai) from the Chitose Air Group, then flying the obsolete Mitsubishi A5M, moved to Vunakanau airfield on the newly taken island of New Britain. The squadron received its first Mitsubishi Zeros (A6M2, Model 21) the same week. On 3 February 1942, Nishizawa, still flying an obsolete A5M, claimed his first aerial kill of the war, a PBY Catalina; historians have established, however, that the plane was only damaged and managed to return to base. On February 10, Nishizawa's squadron was transferred to the newly formed 4th Air Group. As new Zeros became available, Nishizawa was assigned an A6M2 bearing the tail code F-108. On 1 April 1942, Nishizawa's squadron was transferred to Lae, New Guinea and assigned to the Tainan Air Group. There he flew with aces Sabur≈ç Sakai and Toshio ≈åta in a chutai (squadron) led by Junichi Sasai. Sakai described his friend Nishizawa as about 5-foot-8, in weight, pale and gaunt, suffering constantly from malaria and tropical skin diseases. Accomplished at judo, his squadron mates, who nicknamed him the \\"Devil,\\" considered him a reserved, taciturn loner. Of his performance in the air, Sakai, himself one of Japan's leading aerial aces, wrote, \\"Never have I seen a man with a fighter plane do what Nishizawa would do with his Zero. His aerobatics were all at once breathtaking, brilliant, totally unpredictable, impossible, and heart- stirring to witness.\\" They often clashed with United States Army Air Forces and Royal Australian Air Force fighters operating from Port Moresby. Nishizawa's first confirmable solo kill, of a USAAF P-39 Airacobra, was on April 11. He claimed six more kills in a 72-hour period from 1‚Äì3 May, making him a confirmed fighter ace. Nishizawa was a member of the famed \\"Cleanup Trio\\" with Sabur≈ç Sakai and Toshio ≈åta. In the night of 16 May, Nishizawa, Sakai and ≈åta were listening at the lounge room to a broadcast of an Australian radio program, when Nishizawa recognized the eerie Danse Macabre of the French composer, pianist and organist Camille Saint-Sa√´ns. Nishizawa, thinking about this mysterious skeleton dance, now suddenly had a crazy idea: \\"you know the mission tomorrow at Port Moresby? Why don't we perform a little show, a dance of death of our own? We do a few demonstration loops right over the enemy airfield, this should drive them crazy on the ground.\\" On 17 May 1942, Lieutenant Commander Tadashi \\"Shosa\\" Nakajima led the Tainan Ku on a mission to Port Moresby, with Sakai and Nishizawa as his wingmen. As the Japanese formation re-formed for the return flight, Sakai signaled Nakajima, that he was going after an enemy aircraft and peeled off. Minutes later, Sakai was over Port Moresby again, to keep his rendezvous with Nishizawa and ≈åta. The trio now performed aerobatics, three tight loops in close formation. After that, a jubilant Nishizawa indicated that he wanted to repeat the performance. Diving to , the three Zeros did three more loops, still without any AA fire from the ground. They headed then back to Lae, arriving 20 minutes after the rest of the K≈çk≈´tai. At about 21:00, Lieutenant Junichi Sasai wanted them in his office, immediately. When they arrived, Sasai held up a letter. \\"Do you know where I got this thing?\\" he shouted. \\"No? I'll tell you, you fools; it was dropped on this base a few minutes ago, by an enemy intruder!\\" The letter, written in English, said:Guttman, Jon. \\"Hiroyoshi Nishizawa: Japan's World War II Ace of Aces.\\" historynet.com, 12 June 2006 (originally published in Aviation History, July 1998 issue). Retrieved: 9 April 2015. > To the Lae Commander: \\"We were much impressed with those three pilots who > visited us today, and we all liked the loops they flew over our field. It > was quite an exhibition. We would appreciate it if the same pilots returned > here once again, each wearing a green muffler around his neck. We're sorry > we could not give them better attention on their last trip, but we will see > to it that the next time they will receive an all-out welcome from us.\\" Nishizawa, Sakai and ≈åta stood at stiff attention and tried to suppress laughing out loud, while Lieutenant Sasai dressed them down over their \\"idiotic behavior\\" and prohibited them from staging any more aerobatic shows over enemy airfields. The Tainan K≈çk≈´tai's three leading aces secretly agreed that the aerial choreography had been worth it. =Guadalcanal= In early August 1942, the air group moved to Rabaul, immediately operating against the US forces on Guadalcanal. In the first clash on 7 August, Nishizawa claimed six F4F Wildcats (historians have confirmed two kills). On 8 August 1942, Sabur≈ç Sakai, Nishizawa's closest friend, was severely wounded in combat with U.S. Navy carrier-based bombers. Nishizawa noticed that Sakai was missing and went into a mad rage. He searched the area, both for signs of Sakai and for Americans to fight, presumably even if he had to ram them. Eventually, he cooled off and returned to Lakunai. Later, to everyone's amazement, the seriously wounded Sakai arrived. Struck in the head by a bullet, covered with blood and blind in one eye, he returned to base in his damaged Zero after a four-hour, 47-minute flight over . Nishizawa, Lieutenant Sasai and Toshio ≈åta transported the obstinate but barely-conscious Sakai to the hospital. In frustrated concern, Nishizawa physically removed the waiting driver and personally drove Sakai, as quickly but as gently as possible, to the surgeon. Sakai was evacuated to Japan on August 12. The extended conflict over Guadalcanal was costly for Nishizawa's air group (renamed the 251st in November) as American aircraft and tactics improved: Sasai (with 27 victories) was shot down and killed by Captain Marion E. Carl on 26 August 1942, and ≈åta (34 kills) was killed on 21 October 1942. =Return to Japan= In mid- November, the 251st was recalled to Toyohashi air base in Japan to replace its losses, with the ten surviving pilots all being made instructors, including Nishizawa. Nishizawa is believed to have had around 40 full or partial aerial victories by this time (some sources claim 54). Nishizawa, while staying in Japan, visited Sabur≈ç Sakai, who was still recuperating in the Yokosuka hospital. Nishizawa complained to Sakai of his new duty as an instructor: \\"Sabur≈ç, can you picture me running around in a rickety old biplane, teaching some fool youngster how to bank and turn, and how to keep his pants dry?\\" Nishizawa also ascribed the loss of most of their comrade pilots to the ever increasing material advantage of the Allied forces, the improved U.S. aircraft and tactics. \\"It's not as you remember, Sabur≈ç,\\" he said. \\"There was nothing I could do. There were just too many enemy planes, just too many.\\" Even so, Nishizawa could not wait to return to combat. \\"I want a fighter under my hands again,\\" he said. \\"I simply have to get back into action. Staying home in Japan is killing me.\\" Nishizawa publicly chafed at the months of inaction in Japan. He and the 251st returned to Rabaul in May 1943. In June 1943, Nishizawa's achievements were honored by a gift from the commander of the 11th Air Fleet, Vice Admiral Jin'ichi Kusaka. Nishizawa received a military sword inscribed \\"Buko Batsugun\\" (\\"For Conspicuous Military Valor\\"). He was then transferred to the 253rd Air Group on New Britain in September. In November, he was promoted to warrant officer and reassigned to training duties in Japan with the Oita Air Group. In February 1944, he joined the 203rd Air Group, operating from the Kurile Islands, away from heavy action. =Philippines campaign= In October, however, the 203rd was transferred to Luzon. Nishizawa and four others were detached to a smaller airfield on Cebu. On 25 October 1944, Nishizawa led the fighter escort consisting of four A6M5s, flown by Nishizawa, Misao Sugawa, Shingo Honda and Ryoji Baba for the first major kamikaze attack of the war, targeting Vice Admiral Clifton Sprague's \\"Taffy 3\\" task force, which was protecting the landings in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Ceremonial toast: Lt. Seki's Shikishima Unit of the first Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, as they prepare to take-off from the air base at Mabalacat in the Philippines (October 25, 1944). Mitsubishi A6M2 of Lt. Yukio Seki's unit during suicide run on the escort carrier , 25 October 1944.The plane missed the ship St. Lo, causing an enormous fireball 25 October 1944 USS Suwannee (CVE-27)attacked 26 Oct 1944 The kamikaze volunteers, led by Lieutenant Yukio Seki, piloted five bomb-armed A6M2 Model 21 Zeros, each carrying a bomb. They deliberately crashed their planes into U.S. warships in the first official kamikaze attack of the Tokk≈çtai suicide squadron \\"Shikishima\\". They were the first kamikazes to sink an enemy ship. The attack was very successful, as four of the five kamikazes struck their targets and inflicted heavy damage: USS Kalinin Bay (CVE-68): Four diving planes attacked from astern. Two planes were shot down by AA fire. One crashed into the port side of the flight deck, damaging it badly. The other hit the aft port stack, destroying it; USS Kitkun Bay (CVE-71): The port catwalk was clipped and the aircraft exploded off the port side, causing one death and no significant damage; USS White Plains (CVE-66): Two planes attacked. AA fire scored a hit on one attacker who changed course for St. Lo. The second plane was destroyed by AA fire just yards astern of White Plains. White Plains was not hit, but debris was scattered on the aft deck, causing 11 minor injuries. An A6M2 likely flown by SekiLt. Yukio Seki crashed onto the flight deck of the escort carrier at 10:53. The Zero's bomb exploded on the portside hangar deck, resulting in a fire and secondary explosions which soon detonated torpedoes and the bomb magazine of St. Lo. The escort carrier sank half an hour later; 126 men were lost in action. Seki is recorded as saying before the mission: \\"Japan's future is bleak if it is forced to kill one of its best pilots. I am not going on this mission for the Emperor or for the Empire... I am going because I was ordered to!\\" (\\"Kamikaze - Japan's Suicide Gods\\", Page 16, written by Albert Axell, an American writer and Hideaki Kase, living in Tokyo). While flying fighter escort to this kamikaze mission, Nishizawa recorded at minimum, his 86th and 87th victories (both Grumman F6F Hellcats), the final aerial victories of his career.http://acesofww2.com/japan/aces/nishizawa/ Nishizawa had a premonition during the flight; he saw in a vision his own death. Nishizawa reported the sortie's success to Commander Nakajima after returning to base. He then volunteered to take part in the next day's Tokk≈çtai kamikaze mission. His request was refused. Instead, Nishizawa's A6M5 Zero was armed with a bomb and flown by Naval Air Pilot 1st Class Tomisaku Katsumata. A less experienced pilot, he nevertheless dove into the escort carrier off Surigao. Katsumata crashed on Suwanees flight deck and careened into a torpedo bomber which had just been recovered. The two planes erupted upon contact as did nine other planes on her flight deck. Although the ship was not sunk, she burned for several hours, and 85 of her crewmen were killed, 58 were missing and 102 wounded. =Death= The following day, his own Zero having been destroyed, Nishizawa and other pilots of the 201st K≈çk≈´tai boarded a Nakajima Ki-49 Donryu (\\"Helen\\") transport aircraft and left Mabalacat on Pampanga in the morning, to ferry replacement Zeros from Clark Field on Luzon. Over Calapan on Mindoro Island, the Ki-49 transport was attacked by two F6F Hellcats of VF-14 squadron from the fleet carrier and was shot down in flames. Nishizawa died as a passenger, probably the victim of Lt. j.g. Harold P. Newell, who was credited with a \\"Helen\\" northeast of Mindoro that morning. Upon learning of Nishizawa's death, the commander of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, honored Nishizawa with a mention in an all-units bulletin and posthumously promoted him to the rank of lieutenant junior-grade. Nishizawa was also given the posthumous name Bukai-in Kohan Giko Kyoshi, a Zen Buddhist phrase that translates: \\"In the ocean of the military, reflective of all distinguished pilots, an honored Buddhist person.\\" Because of the confusion towards the end of the Pacific war, the bulletin's publication was delayed and funeral services were not held until December 2, 1947.

It is published by Seven Seas Entertainment and the first volume came out in 2006. Destiny's Hand is no longer running as a webmanga on Seven Seas Entertainment's site and has been replaced by the Moonlight Meow manga. The rest of the series is now only in print form. Plot The story begins with a flashback to when Olivia is thirteen. Olivia is in arranged marriage that she is determined to escape. The ship she and her parents are traveling on is taken by the Destiny's Hand. When Diego threatens her father, Olivia manages to defeat him with a knife and her wits. Captain Blaine gives her a favor, and Olivia asks to join the crew of the Destiny's Hand. Her father disowns her, and she joins the crew of Destiny's Hand. Three years later, it is Owen who is telling Olivia's story to their captives. When they are about to depart, they are attacked by the 'Kraken', Mulgrew's ship. After a fierce battle, Blaine's only good lung had been pierced. With Captain Blaine dying, he appoints the only person he considers brave enough to lead a crew to find the Devil's Eye: Olivia Soldana. Blaine then tells of Destiny's Hand's Five Fingers that guide her, Olivia, Diego, Matthau, and Badru. He also tells them of the Fifth finger, a scholar who reads the ancient language of Priscus. After, the crew heads to Vickensburg where they attempt to recruit Elias, the Governor's son and the Index finger who should point the way to the Devil's Eye. Blaine gives them a picture of the ship's Figurehead, Lady Kate and tells them that showing it to him should convince him to join them. Olivia and Badru sneak into the governor's mansion and ask Elias. Elias refuses to join them, so Olivia and Badru leave the picture and return to the ship. Upon their return, it is revealed that Elias is Blaine's son. It also reveals some of Blaine's past and the story of Lady Kate. Lady Kate was actually based on a woman named Katherine who was going to be forced to marry the governor's son. She asked for passage of Blaine's ship. Katherine practiced some sort of magic, a form of future sight and used it to steer Blaine's ship in the right direction, and avoid storms. She also sees the future Mulgrew's attempt to capture the Devil's Eye, and when she was pregnant, she told Blaine she had to marry the governor's son so that their son would grow up to be a scholar. Katherine later died in childbirth. Olivia then goes back to the governor's mansion and kidnaps Elias and brings him back to Destiny's Hand. She then tells him Blaine is his father. When Elias and Blaine meet face-to-face, Elias points a gun to Blaine's head, stating that his father is the Governor of Vickensburg. Blaine tells the others to leave while he talks with Elias. After some time, Elias joins them in the search for the Devil's Eye and calls Blaine ‚Äúfather‚Äù. Inside the library in Valroux, Elias and Olivia learn that a new law has been passed: ‚ÄúAny pirate found on Valroux soil is to be detained, tried, and executed.‚Äù Even the pirates of Destiny's Hand are no exception. Olivia is forced to wound Michel so he isn't seen allied with the pirates. From the book Elias stole, he manages to figure out that the book was about Josiah Zevon's quest in search of the Devil's Eye. Apparently he had a map to Isle du Diablo. He tore it into quarters, gave three to his most trusted lieutenants, and kept the fourth to himself. Matthau was once a cabin boy aboard Zevon's ship. He knew that Zevon retired to a small island, northwest of Permonde. Later, the Kraken is following them. From a message inside a bottle, Mulgrew learns of Destiny's Hand's crew fallout and that they have a piece of the map and going to get another. Sometime later, Blaine asks Owen to write the tales of Olivia's adventures after he finishes with Blaine's. When Owen leaves, Blaine tells Olivia that he wants the crew to accept her as captain before telling them of Blaine's sickness. Olivia, Matthau, Badru, and Owen journey to Zevon's island. They learn that Zevon burnt his piece of the map. When they leave, Zevon didn't burn it but hid it. Back on the ship, Elias touches Lady Kate figurehead and hears a voice in his head. She tells him that they are in danger. When Zevon tried to finally burn the map, Mulgrew stopped him.  Characters  =Destiny‚Äôs Hand= A crew of pirates under Captain Blaine, who follows the pirate code. *Sebastian Blaine :Captain of the \\"Destiny's Hand,\\" he is a noble captain and a gentleman pirate. Sadly, his breed is dying. He is in search for the Devil's Eye, so the new, violent pirates can't get it, for example, Lars Mulgrew. His ship, the Destiny's Hand, is said to be unsinkable. He is renowned for sparing the crew and passengers that surrender him. He will merely take the cargo and escort the ship safely to port. When Mulgrew took out his one good lung, Blaine is confirmed to be dying. *Lady Kate :Lady Kate is the figurehead on Destiny's Hand. Some say it's her protection that makes the ship unsinkable. The only thing certain about her is that Lady Kate is inspired by a real woman (Katherine Marsh), someone who meant a lot to Captain Blaine further the figurehead of Lady Kate also has a sadness about her that seems to hint a lot about her story. *Owen Galviston :Though he came aboard the Destiny's Hand to write a biography of Blaine, he hasn't for six years and has stayed on the ship since remaining a 'guest' of the crew. He is the one who tells the story of young Olivia at the beginning of the series. *Wyatt : Wyatt joined the crew two years after Olivia joins the crew. He's last name is unknown. He is the lookout aboard Destiny's Hand. He has keen eyesight and a tendency to be in places he should not be, and someday dreams of working with the sails rather than being a lookout. Destiny‚Äôs Hand‚Äôs Five Fingers *Frederick Matthau :He is the strategist and navigator aboard Destiny's Hand, and said to be the best at reading both situations and maps. Matthau is also said to be an excellent judge of character, who by his own nature is a very solitary and lonely man keeping most of his contact with Blaine. Matthau is the Thumb of Destiny's Hand. It is the finger that is the leader of the rest. *Elias Houghton :Son of Governor Houghton of St. Vickensburg, who has inherited his father's distaste for pirates. However, this is a problem for Blaine, who needs his help for the last quest he is setting out to fulfill. Elias is actually Blaine's son. When he finally accepts Blaine as his real father, he will start to say ‚Äúfather‚Äù instead of ‚Äúcaptain.‚Äù Elias is the Index finger of Destiny‚Äôs Hand. He is the scholar who speaks Priscus and the key to the map to the Devil‚Äôs Eye. *Diego Basteon : Boatswain aboard the \\"Destiny's Hand,\\" works hard to keep discipline amongst the crew and as such has become one of Blaine's key lieutenants. His weapon of choice is a cat-o-nine-tails with which he is very effective. He has a very bad temper. Diego is the Middle finger of Destiny's Hand. It represents aggression and discipline. *Olivia Soldana :The daughter of a rich family, Olivia left her family behind to join Blaine's crew. She is 16 years of age and the main character in Destiny's Hand. She became Captain Blaine's right-hand woman and the one to lead his crew on one last adventure after his death. However, it is hard for the crew to trust her because she is a girl, no matter how strong or brave. She is the Ring finger of Destiny's hand. It represents family and commitment to the future. *Badru :A native from one of the local islands. He admires Blaine's gentlemanly way with piracy. He is considered by Owen to be stupid, but Olivia claims that he is the smartest man aboard, probably because of his survival skills. He is also one of the few members of the crew who can read and write. Badru is the Pinky of Destiny's Hand, which represents promises given and of trust. Badru was completely redesigned from his original model to make him stand out more. =The Kraken= *Lars Mulgrew :He is a symbol of everything that Blaine hates, following a path of pillage and killing rather than the more peaceful one Blaine desires all pirates to follow. He takes Blaine's last good lung, which causes Blaine to appoint Olivia as captain. *The Kraken :Mulgrew's ship is called The Kraken, named after one of the most feared mythical creatures of the deep. Since Destiny's Hand has Lady Kate, the Kraken has its own figurehead. This figurehead inspires terror in all who behold it. =Others= *Michel Langrisse :Captain of the defense fleet of the port of Valroux, which is a very pirate-friendly port. Blaine's crew is particularly welcome because they never hurt innocents and try to avoid killing anyone. He is later revealed to be the man whom Olivia was arranged to marry. He has a quite laidback attitude, but he knows when to put his foot down and take order again. In the series, Michel and Olivia have a some kind of a relationship. *Thomas Houghton :Governor of St. Vickensburg, and very anti-pirate making his port very dangerous for pirates to get anywhere near. Also due to his personal troubles with Captain Blaine in the past, something neither man will talk about, there is very bad blood between them, fueling his general hatred of all pirates. *Katherine Marsh :She is the governess and wife of Thomas Houghton of St. Vickensburg. She was predestined to meet Blaine at the ports of St. Vickensburg seventeen years ago. She asked to aboard his ship to escape her marriage to Thomas. She has the ability to foretell the future. Eventually she and Blaine fell in love. When she became pregnant with Blaine‚Äôs son, she broke her relationship with Blaine, telling him that one day Destiny‚Äôs Hand‚Äôs crew will be the last of good, decent pirates. When that happens, Mulgrew will seek the Devil‚Äôs Eye and if he should claim it, tragedy will rain down upon the world. She said Elias will be the one to help Blaine, otherwise Blaine will not succeed. If she marries Thomas, Elias will have access to the finest teachers, libraries and institutions to become a scholar and learn the language of the ancients. Before she left, she placed a piece of her soul into Destiny‚Äôs Hand‚Äôs figurehead, into Lady Kate, and asked her to protect the ship as she once had. Afterwards, Katherine died of childbirth.

It is a kick where the ball is dropped from the players' hands and kicked slightly off the longer center line of the ball before it hits the ground. It is the primary means of kicking the ball in Australian football and is similar to punts used tactically in other football codes, such as American and Canadian football. There are different styles of kicking depending on how the ball is held in the hand. The most common style of kicking seen in today's game, principally because of its superior accuracy, is the drop punt, where the ball is dropped from the hands down, almost to the ground, to be kicked so that the ball rotates in a reverse end over end motion as it travels through the air. Other commonly used kicks are the torpedo punt (also known as the spiral, barrel, or screw punt), where the ball is held flatter at an angle across the body, which makes the ball spin around its long axis in the air, resulting in extra distance (similar to the traditional motion of an American football punt), and the checkside punt or \\"banana\\", kicked across the ball on the outside of the foot is used to curve the ball (towards the right if kicked off the right foot) towards targets that are on an angle. There is also the \\"snap\\", which is almost the same as a checkside punt, except that it is kicked off the inside of the foot and curves in the opposite direction. It is also possible to kick the ball so that it bounces along the ground. This is known as a grubber or dribble kick. Grubbers can bounce in a straight line, or curve to the left or right. Drop punt Video of a drop punt In a drop punt the ball is held vertically, and dropped and kicked before it hits the ground, resulting in the ball spinning backwards end over end. It is the primary method of disposing the ball by foot in Australian rules football. It is considered more accurate and easier to mark than a regular punt kick, which is held flat and does not spin in the air. In gridiron football it is referred to as a pooch punt or quick kick, a kick used by punters when the team is too far out for a field goal and too close to kick a normal punt because the ball will probably go into the end zone, losing field position in the resulting touchback. The kick has gradually replaced the less effective \\"coffin-corner kick\\", which was similar to rugby football's \\"kicking for touch\\" where the object was to put the ball out of bounds near the opposition goal. Like Australian rules football drop punts, the pooch punt requires the punter to control the distance and former Australian footballers like Darren Bennett and Ben Graham are generally credited with increasing the popularity of this kick in the National Football League. Jack Dyer is generally credited with inventing the drop punt during his playing days with the Richmond Football Club. Horrie Clover and the Collier brothers, Albert and Harry, are also attributed with being the first to use the kick regularly. Torpedo punt The torpedo punt (also known as screw punt or spiral punt) is the longest type of punt kick. In flight, the ball spins about its long axis, instead of end over end (like a drop punt) or not at all (like a regular punt kick). This makes the flight of the ball more aerodynamic, but more difficult to catch (or mark in some football codes). In Australian rules football, the kick has become less common since the 1980s, as modern tactics have meant that accuracy has become typically more important than distance in field kicking; coaches now prefer the use of the drop punt in general field play. The kick may still be seen when a player needs additional distance or when a game is played in wet weather and forward movement by conventional methods is more difficult as a result. If kicked correctly, an Australian football can travel over 60 metres, while a normal punt will travel less distance. Australian rules footballer Gordon Rattray, who played his football with the Fitzroy Football Club between 1917 and 1928, is credited as the first player to use the torpedo punt.Fitzroy Has Never Lacked Courage, The Argus Weekend Magazine, (Saturday, 6 August 1949), p.3. Checkside punt Also known as a 'banana kick', the checkside punt is a kicking style used in Australian rules football, rugby league and rugby union. When kicked, it bends away from the body. For the true checkside, the ball is held with ends pointing to 2 and 8 o-clock (for a right footed kick) and is kicked more off the outside of the boot with the ball spinning at an opposite direction to the swing of the leg. This enables the ball to have a greater curving effect thus opening up the face of the goals to give a larger goal face. In the early 1890s, Allen Burns, who played Australian rules with the (then) Victorian Football Association club South Melbourne, was renowned for what seems to be an early version of the banana kick. The following is taken from newspaper reports of the match between Fitzroy and South Melbourne on Saturday 23 June 1894, that was played in showers of rain, on a very wet and slippery ground, with a very heavy and very wet leather football: St Kilda Full Forward William (Bill) Young is generally thought to be the first player to use the kick in the VFL. He had been using it in the 1940s at Victorian Country Club Stratford and there is photographic evidence of him using it against Collingwood in the 1950s. Others say the kick was first popularised in South Australia in the 1960s by the Sturt Football Club coached by Jack Oatey. He himself was an exponent of the kick decades earlier in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). It is now one of the most common techniques for goal-kicking from a narrow angle, and more recently has been used in field kicking with deadly accuracy by players like James Hird, but was most famously used by Peter Daicos. It is usually used when a set shot for goal is lined up on a narrow angle.

Cox was born in Rahway, New Jersey to Quaker family. After renouncing his religion and serving in the War of 1812, he studied law before entering the ministry.Gilman, Daniel Coit; Peck, Harry Thurston; and Colby, Frank Moore (eds.) (1902) The New International Encyclopaedia pg. 391 He was pastor of the Presbyterian church in Mendham, New Jersey from 1817 to 1821. He then moved to New York City, where he was pastor of two churches from 1821 to 1834. Cox helped found the University of the City of New York, now New York University, in 1832, teaching classes in theology and contributing the college's motto, Perstare et praestare (\\"To persevere and to excel\\"). Due to his anti-slavery stance, he was mobbed, and his house and Laight Street church were sacked in the Anti-abolitionist riots of 1834, and he was burned in effigy by another mob in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1835. After the riots he moved out of the city, and from 1834 to 1837 was professor of pastoral theology in Auburn, New York. Cox was known beyond the church for his skills as an orator, despite or perhaps because he was described as \\"eccentric\\" and would sometimes lapse from English into Latin. One speech he made in Exeter Hall in 1833, in which he put the responsibility for slavery in America on the British government, made such a great impression that it was widely republished. Theodore Ledyard Cuyler described Cox as \\"one of the most famous celebrities in the Presbyterian Church... famous for his linguistic attainments, for his wit and occasional eccentricities, and very famous for his bursts of eloquence on great occasions.\\"Cuyler, Theodore Ledyard (1902) Recollections of a Long Life When awarded the appellation of Doctor of Divinity by the College of New Jersey, which would later become Princeton University, he famously derided it as a couple of \\"semi-lunar fardels\\". Cox's next seventeen years were passed as pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn Heights, while also serving as Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the Union Theological Seminary, and as a leader of the \\"New School\\" Presbyterians. In 1854, owing to a throat infection and loss of his voice, he removed to Owego, New York. He died at Bronxville, New York, on October 2, 1880. His son, Arthur Cleveland Coxe, became bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York, and another son, Samuel Hanson Coxe, was an Episcopal minister in Utica, New York, who married Eliza Conkling, sister of Republican political boss and Presidential candidate Senator Roscoe Conkling; both of them, along with some other of his 15 children, reverted to an earlier spelling of the family name. His grandson Alfred Conkling Coxe would become a noted federal judge in New York.

The concept has two components: a metaphysical and an epistemological. The metaphysical component rests on a distinction between the concepts \\"real\\" and \\"exist\\". Something exists if it: # occupies space; # has matter; # is in time; # is affected by causation. Mystical realism also favors participation instead individualization where the individual participates in the universal and the knower participates in the known. Regarding worship, this philosophy cites the altar as a place in the temporal world where the opposition between the Divine and the human is overcome.  Interpretations  Mystical realism is evident in the political ideology of the 16th and 17th centuries in Russia, particularly in the attempt to find sacred meaning in the authority of the Tsar. The ecclesiastical thought that emerged during this period drew from mystical realism in the way it resulted to meditations on the concept of the so-called secret history, which pertained to the expectation of a mysterious and sacred aspect to an external historical reality. George Barker Stevens used the term mystical realism to describe Saint Paul's form of thought, particularly in the way he treated race and Adam. Here, race is associated with the sinners while Adam is identified with the believer. The mystical component articulates the sense of being unique, vital and inscrutable while realism is used to denote the sinful humanity considered as present and a participant in Adam's sin.

It is currently thought to have been built between 1677‚Äì1678. Past historians considered it to be the oldest brick house in the United States, although that distinction belongs to Bacon's Castle, the 1665 plantation home of Virginian Arthur Allen.Coolidge, Ruth Dame. Round About Old Medford, Medford Historical Society, 1934.Hooper, John H. \\"Some Old Medford Houses and Estates\\", Medford Historic Register. VII:3 (July 1904). History The house has been called the \\"fort\\" and the \\"garrison house\\" because of its thick walls and portholes. For many years it was believed that the house was built by Mathew Cradock, one of 35 founding members of the Massachusetts Bay Company. He reputedly owned the first wooden toll bridge in America (1632), but Cradock only owned the land and never even visited America. In 1677, Richard Russell of Charlestown sold the land with \\"one dwelling house and barn\\" to Peter Tufts [Sr.] of Charlestown, although a prior agreement may have been made, with Tufts Sr. likely already settled on the land.Middlesex County Registry of Deeds. The house was probably built by Peter Tufts, who sold it to his son, Peter (Captain) Tufts Jr. in 1680. The brick mason was William Bucknam, brought over in 1632 from Chelsea, England to build the house. It is the son for whom the house is named. In 1728, the eastern side of the property was sold to Edward Oakes of Malden. In 1887, Samuel Lawrence saved the house from demolition when he purchased it as a wedding gift for his daughter. The interior was remodeled at this time in the Colonial Revival style. Only the support beams and parts of the staircase were kept intact from the original period. Much of the exterior remains original, except the front porch was added between 1889‚Äì1900. In 1892, when the City of Medford was incorporated, an image of the house was used in its city seal. The house was purchased for $9,700 by William Sumner Appleton with donations. He offered it to the Medford Historical Society, but they said they were unable to care for it at that time. In 1930, ownership was transferred to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now Historic New England). In 1982, it was purchased by the Medford Historical Society, which now maintains the property. Charles Tufts (1781‚Äì1876), a descendant of Peter Tufts Sr., would later donate land in Medford for the campus of Tufts University.

He used Cleveland as his given name and is often referred to as A. Cleveland Coxe. Biography He was the son of the Reverend Samuel Hanson Cox and Abiah Hyde Cleveland, but changed the spelling of the family name.Cleveland, A Compendium of American Literature, 1865, p.707 He was born at Mendham, New Jersey, May 10, 1818. On his mother's side he was a grandson of the Rev. Aaron Cleveland, an early poet of Connecticut. His parents moved to New York in 1820, and he received his education there. Coxe was prepared for college under the private tuition of Professor George Bush. He entered the University of the City of New York, and graduated in 1838. During his freshman year he wrote a poem, The Progress of Ambition, and in 1837 published Advent, a Mystery, a poem after the manner of the religious dramas of the Middle Ages. In 1838 appeared Athwold, a Romaunt, and Saint Jonathan, the Lay of the Scald, designed as the commencement of a semi- humorous poem, in the Don Juan style. Coxe in 1841 became a student in the General Theological Seminary, New York. While at this institution he delivered a poem, Athanasion, before the Alumni of Washington College, Hartford, at the Commencement in 1840. In the same year he published Christian Ballads, a collection of poems, suggested for the most part by the holy seasons and services of his church. The volume went into numerous editions, so much so that \\"their place in American literature has long been secure.\\"Buffalo Historical Society article, p.356 He was ordained deacon on June 27, 1841Buffalo Historical Society article by Bishop Benjamin T. Onderdonk in St. Paul's Chapel,The Bishops of the American Church, p.159 priest on September 25, 1842, at St. John's Episcopal Church (Hartford, Connecticut). As a deacon he took charge of St. Anne's church, Morrisania, where he wrote his poem, Halloween, privately printed in 1842. The Right Reverend Arthur Cleveland Coxe Image taken from The Bishops of the American Church p.158 He then became rector of St. John's Episcopal Church (Hartford, Connecticut), from 1842‚Äì1854. While there he published a dramatic poem Saul: a mystery, of the same kind as his earlier productions but at much greater length. But it was condemned by reviewers including Edgar Allan Poe.Marginalia 39, quoted in Poe's works, vol. 3, 1875 'The Rev. Arthur Coxe's \\"Saul, a Mystery,\\" having been condemned in no measured terms by Poe of \\"The Broadway Journal,\\" and Green of \\"The Emporium,\\" a writer in the Hartford Columbian retorts as follows... Latterly I have read \\"Saul,\\" and agree with the epigrammatist that it \\"will do\\"-whoever attempts to wade through it. It will do, also, for trunk-paper. The author is right in calling it \\"A Mystery\\"-for a most unfathomable mystery it is.\\" He also published an Apology for the English Bible against revisions of the Authorised Version by the American Bible Society, and the work ultimately prompted the suppression of these revised versions. Here as elsewhere he was hostile to any revised translation of the Bible.Buffalo Historical Society article, p.358 Anglican Orders was a series of papers, originally contributed to the Paris journal, Union Chr√©tienne. An open letter to Pius IX (1869) was in answer to the brief convoking the first Vatican Council, and was widely read and translated into many languages in Europe. L'Episcopat de l'Occident was published at Paris in 1872 and contained a history of the Church of England and a refutation of Roman Catholic attacks. He became rector of Grace Church, Baltimore, in 1854-1863. While there he was elected bishop of Texas, but declined. He received a doctorate in divinity from St. James College, Hagerstown, Maryland in 1856; again from Trinity, Hartford, Connecticut in 1868, and again from Durham University in the United Kingdom in 1888. He received a doctorate of laws from Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio in 1868. He was rector of Calvary Church, New York City, in 1863. Then he went to Trinity Church, Geneva, New York on January 4, 1865. On January 4, 1865 he became bishop coadjutor to the first bishop of Western New York, and on April 5, on the death of bishop De Lancey, second bishop of Western New York. In 1868 he agreed to the division of the diocese, to create the diocese of Central New York. During his time the diocese prospered. In 1868 there were 69 resident clergy and 76 parishes, and 6,296 families associated with them. The value of the church property was about $1m. In 1890 there were 123 resident clergy and 133 parishes, while the number of families was 16,699, and the property was worth $2.3m. In 1872 the missions of the church in Haiti were placed under the control of his diocese. Late in the year he visited the island, consecrating a church, ordaining six priests and five deacons, holding a convocation of the clergy and administering confirmation to a large number of candidates. He retained the charge of the Haitian church until the consecration of its own bishop, James Theodore Holly, in 1874. Bishop Coxe wrote spirited defences of Anglican orders. He entered controversy with various contemporary Roman Catholic clergymen, such as Bishop Stephen V. Ryan of the Diocese of Buffalo, who, in 1880, published against Coxe Claims of a Protestant episcopal bishop to apostolical succession and valid orders disproved.... Among Coxe's own theological works were: The Criterion, (1866); Apollos, or the Way of God, (1873); and The Institutes of Christian History, (1887). He also translated a work by the Abbe Labord, on the Impossibility of the Immaculate Conception, with notes. He also edited the United States Ante-Nicene Fathers series of early Christian texts. Other works included Impressions of England (1855), originally contributed to his New York Church Journal. Coxe designed the seal of Hobart College and the main administrative building of the College is named in his honor. Coxe is buried in Geneva, New York. A memorial volume was in preparation at the time of the Buffalo Historical Society article.

The dam was completed in the early 1960s as part of the federal Central Valley Project to provide irrigation water to the arid San Joaquin Valley. Standing high, Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake ‚Äì California's third largest reservoir, with a capacity of more than . The dam includes a hydroelectric plant, and also provides flood control to the Trinity and Klamath river basins. Below the dam is Lewiston Lake, formed by a second dam, which diverts water through a 3-mile tunnel to the Sacramento Valley. Background In response to the Great Depression and drought conditions in California during the early 20th century, the United States Congress passed the 1935 Rivers and Harbors Act, which authorized the Central Valley Project (CVP) ‚Äì a system of dams and canals to provide a stable supply of irrigation water to California's Central Valley. Among the project works was a 1942 proposal to divert water from the Trinity River in northwestern California to augment water supplies in the CVP service area, known as the Trinity River Division. However, the state dropped the Trinity River project from the CVP in 1945. Six years later, however, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), which was responsible for the construction and operations of most CVP facilities, revived the division, which comprised a system of four dams and two tunnels to capture and store the flow of the Trinity and transport it to the Sacramento River, generating a net surplus of hydroelectric power along the way. Trinity Dam was to be the main storage feature of the division, providing a stable flow to the Lewiston Dam, the diversion point for Trinity River waters into the Central Valley. Construction Construction at Trinity Dam began on June 4, 1956 with preliminary excavation and the river was diverted around the dam site on July 8, 1957. Work was bogged down in late 1957 when the river flooded and took out the cofferdam that protected the construction site. However, workers cleared out the dam site by the summer of 1958, and the hiatus also allowed them time to line the diversion tunnel with concrete. Rock placement began on the main structure as early as 1957, but it was not until 1959 when a conveyor belt was incorporated, allowing much faster transport of fill to the dam site. The spillway tunnel was completed in October 1959 and the embankment was topped out in late 1960. The dam's power plant, however, was not finished until December 1963. Trinity stood as the highest earthfill dam in the world until eclipsed by the Oroville Dam, also in California, in 1968. The latter remains the tallest dam in the United States. As the reservoir filled, it submerged the pioneer towns of Trinity Center, Stringtown and Minersville as well as parts of a historic Northern California stagecoach route. The reservoir was originally named Clair Engle Lake after Clair Engle, a United States senator and major proponent of the CVP. This name was unpopular among local residents, many of whom had watched their homes inundated by the rising waters. By 1995, it had been renamed Trinity Lake. Specifications Overview of Trinity Dam complex showing the spillway to the left and powerhouse in right center Trinity Dam is an earth and rock-filled dam composed mainly of river gravel and local rock, rising from its foundations and above the riverbed. The dam's crest is long and above sea level. High water releases are controlled by three different sets of gates. The outlet works have a capacity of , and the service spillway, a morning-glory (bell-mouth) design, can take of water. The dam's auxiliary spillway has a capacity of . Trinity Lake can hold up to at full pool, and encompasses up to of water. Trinity Powerplant, located at the base of the dam, has two Francis turbines with a capacity of 140 megawatts (MW) combined, uprated from an original capacity of 100 MW. The plant generates an average of 358.97 million kilowatt hours (kWh) and has a low capacity factor, which means it operates mainly on a peaking basis. Salmon Hatchery Trinity Dam forms an impassable barrier for migrating salmon in the Trinity River, but along with other division facilities has also had adverse impacts on salmon habitat in the lower reaches of the river. Within ten years of the dam's completion, more than three-quarters of Trinity River water was being diverted to the Central Valley each year, and the little flow left in the river was warm, shallow and less suitable for spawning salmon. In addition, the dam blocks the Trinity River's annual floods and sediment loads, leading to degradation in the gravel bars that are vital for salmon habitat. In response to declining salmon populations, the USBR built the Trinity River Fish Hatchery. The hatchery is operated by the California Department of Fish and Game and has a capacity of 40 million eggs. In 1992, Congress passed the Central Valley Project Improvement Act, which established a minimum annual release of into the lower Trinity River. Also, below the Trinity Dam, is the Lewiston Dam (California) in which that water is sent to other water customers that live throughout the State. This is important because this requires the help of two dams just to move water from the reservoir to the customers that require water for either Agriculture or Urban uses. Recreation With of shoreline, Trinity Lake is a popular summer destination for Northern California residents. Since 1965, the lake has been part of the Trinity Unit of the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area. The lake has been developed with boat ramps and marinas, most of which are concentrated in the Stuart Fork arm in the southwest and around the resort town of Trinity Center near the north end of the reservoir.

He was the independent Member of Parliament for the riding of Portneuf‚ÄîJacques-Cartier from 2006 to 2011. He is known for his outspoken style and anti-statist right-of-center politics in a province known for mainly supporting left-of-center policies, but has nonetheless earned widespread popularity, earning the nickname le Roi Arthur (\\"King Arthur\\"). Personal life Both Arthur's father, Ren√©, and uncle, G√©rard Arthur, were radio hosts. Ren√© and G√©rard were Armenian immigrant children who came from Constantinople to Montreal in the 1910s, fleeing the Armenian genocide, with their parents and siblings, via New York City. According to Arthur, the family was mistakenly considered to be Jewish by some Montreal residents at the time, because their last name contained the name Isaac, thus being victims of antisemitism. Consequently, the family changed its name to Arthur, a French- sounding name, which was also Andr√© Arthur's grandfather's first name (he was alternatively known as Arthur Isakian or Arthur DerSahag, Sahag meaning Isaac in Armenian). Arthur's mother was a Qu√©b√©coise by the name of Tanguay, a name that originally came from Brittany to Quebec in the 17th century. As a young adult, Arthur worked as a hockey referee. According to Arthur, this experience taught him how to accept being heavily criticized. Arthur is divorced and has two children. Radio Arthur began his radio career at CHRC in 1970. He has also appeared on CJRP, CKAC, CKVL, CJMF-FM, CJMS and, most recently (until December 22, 2005), at CKNU-FM and CIMI-FM, all French-language stations. In 2007, Arthur was briefly part of a morning show on CHEQ-FM with Marie Saint- Laurent as well as the web radio station Rockik.com. Arthur's career has been marked by a number of lawsuits. He has been sued for defamation by two Quebec Premiers, Lucien Bouchard and Daniel Johnson Jr. He has also faced penalizing decisions by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council regarding several on-air statements he made which led to the non-renewal of the licence of CHOI-FM. His most recent gig, as morning and noon host for CKNU in Donnacona, Quebec, ended on December 22, 2005, soon after Genex Communications announced it was selling the station to RNC Media, which declined to renew his contract. On November 17, 1998, during a broadcast on CKVL, Arthur attacked taxi drivers in Montreal, especially those who were \\"Arab and Haitian\\". According to the summary of facts presented in the Superior Court, Arthur denounced \\"their incompetence and filthiness, while suggesting they get their licenses by corruption and are somehow responsible for the deplorable state of this mode of transport in the city.\\" On February 17, 2011, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Arthur. In January 2018, he was fired from BLVD 102.1 FM for referring to a road in the LGBT district of Quebec City as \\"AIDS Boulevard\\".http://www.lapresse.ca/arts/medias/201801/29/01-5151869-andre- arthur-congedie.php For several years, Arthur opened his radio show with the theme song from The Muppet Show. Television From 1972 to 1979, in addition to being heard on CHRC, Arthur was a news anchor for the local evening news program at T√©l√©-4 (CFCM-TV, a TVA affiliate) in Quebec City. On August 20, 2008, it was announced that Arthur would host a talk show on the TQS network, starting September 29; however, a federal election was called in the meantime, delaying the starting date. Arthur successfully ran for MP in the 2008 election. TQS announced the show's cancellation on August 5, 2009. \\"TQS a mis fin √† l'√©mission d'Andr√© Arthur plus t√¥t que pr√©vu\\" . showbizz.net, August 5, 2009. = Malenfant TV serie = In December 2009, cable channel S√©ries+ announced it would broadcast in the winter of 2011 a four-part miniseries on Raymond Malenfant, produced by Ricardo Trogi. The role of Raymond Malenfant will be played by Luc Picard and Francis Cantin (Raymond Malenfant young adult). The role of Andr√© Arthur (1986, 1991 and 2001) will be played by Jean- Fran√ßois Porlier. Politics Andr√© Arthur is a self-described libertarian, and his political views are generally in line with the libertarian ideology. He generally opposes the concept of government intervention in the economy, and supports tax cuts (as opposed to subsidies) as the most efficient way to promote economic growth and respect individual liberty. He is also a noted admirer of the United States, which he perceives to be less intrusive in people's lives. Arthur claims that if he were an American citizen he would never vote for George W. Bush as President - one factor being Arthur's opposition to the Iraq War. Nonetheless, Arthur considers George W. Bush (as well as Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper) to be very consistent, a quality that he admires. Arthur is a federalist. He is known for his opposition to Quebec sovereignty, not so much because of any profound attachment to Canada, but because he fears independence would increase what he sees as the socialist tendencies of Quebec as a political entity. According to a number of Parti Qu√©b√©cois analysts, Arthur's influence was a significant cause of the lower-than-expected \\"Yes\\" vote in the Quebec City area in the 1995 referendum.Robert McKenzie. \\"Talk-show terror driving bus: Fired radio host shifts gears and takes to the highway\\", The Gazette, May 18, 2002. Arthur first ran for office as an Independent candidate in the Louis-H√©bert district in the 1994 Quebec provincial election. He finished second with 29% of the vote, behind Parti Qu√©b√©cois candidate Paul B√©gin (39%). In 1997, Arthur ran for the office of mayor of Sainte-Foy against incumbent Andr√©e Boucher. Boucher was re-elected and Arthur finished second, with 33% of the vote. Arthur's first successful bid for office was in the 2006 Canadian federal election, when he was elected as an Independent Member of Parliament for the Portneuf‚ÄîJacques-Cartier district of Quebec. Arthur officially became a candidate on January 2, 2006, three weeks before Election Day. Having the advantage of name recognition and running an intensive pre-campaign every day for about two months during his morning and noon shows, he used no campaign paraphernalia and spent only $924 on his campaign. Arthur boasts of being \\"the cheapest Member of Parliament in Canada\\", claiming to have spent less than any other elected candidate at this election. While the 2006 federal election was not Arthur's first attempt to win political office, he claimed that bid was the only time he really wanted to be elected. According to Arthur, his goal in previous elections had been to divide the results. In winning the riding, Arthur became the first truly independent and non-incumbent candidate to be elected to the House of Commons since Tony Roman won an Ontario district in 1984. On January 25, 2006, in an interview with Anna Maria Tremonti, host of CBC Radio One's morning news program The Current, Arthur stated that he would not join any political party during the then-current parliament, but he did note that the policies of the governing Conservative Party of Canada best reflected his personal political beliefs and stances on many major issues. He also stated that he entered politics as an independent with the influence and record of non-affiliated MP Chuck Cadman, the most recent MP to be elected to the House of Commons as an independent, in mind. It was reported in May 2006 that he might consider joining the Conservatives, however he later denied this saying his comments had been misunderstood. On November 30, 2006, Arthur announced in a press conference that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and would be receiving treatment at Quebec City's Hotel-Dieu hospital in the coming weeks. He also mentioned that despite the cancer, he would remain in his post as the MP for Portneuf‚ÄîJacques-Cartier. Arthur consistently voted to support the government on confidence matters. As a result, the Conservative Party decided not to run a candidate against him in the 2008 and 2011 federal elections. This decision proved to be decisive in his 2008 re- election; Arthur retained the seat with only 33.5% of the vote, against 32% for Richard Cot√© of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. In 2011, Globe and Mail noted in an interview that aired on CHOI-FM in Quebec City on Aug. 23, 2007, shortly after a Tory cabinet shuffle, tdirected some of his well-known on-air venom toward Stephen Harper's new team. He called Peter MacKay, dismissing him as \\"a loser\\" and \\"a ridiculous character\\". Stated that Jim Prentice was \\"not a bad\\" minister who spent all his time solving problems for the Prime Minister and Bev Oda \\"lamentable - unable to find her behind with her two hands\\". However, Quebec MP Maxime Bernier, defended his party choice not stating to field a candidate during the 2011 election by stating \\"Absolutely not. He is an independent and he has his freedom of speech,\\" and \\"Who doesn't make mistakes in life?\\"Arthur was defeated in 2011 by the New Democratic Party candidate, √âlaine Michaud. Bus driver While a Member of Parliament, Arthur worked as a tour bus driver for Intercar. He claimed that his position as an independent MP freed him from the obligation to attend caucuses and partisan social events, going as far as suggesting all MPs should get a second job to put them in touch with ordinary people. This earned him the criticism from his opponents, who noted Arthur had been absent from Parliament for nearly one- third of the votes since 2006, something for which Arthur is unapologetic.

The dam was built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The lake's capacity is , making it one of the largest reservoirs in California. The lake's surface is at above MSL. Trinity Lake captures and stores water for the Central Valley Project, which provides the Central Valley with water for irrigation and produces hydroelectric power. This lake is known for its many small arms, glassy inlets, and great water-skiing conditions. After the death in office of California United States Senator Clair Engle in 1964, the lake was renamed after him; however, the name change never received wide popularity, especially with locals, and the name was eventually returned to its frequently known original name. The lake is serviced by three marinas: Trinity Alps Marina located on the southern end in view of the Dam; Cedar Stock marina on the Stuart Fork arm on the west end of the lake; and Trinity Center marina at the northern end of the main arm of the lake. Most of the marinas rent houseboats to vacationers year round. Most marinas on the lake are now owned and operated by Forever Resorts, with the only exception being the Trinity Alps Marina. View of Trinity Lake  Geology  Trinity Lake is located northwest of Redding, California, off of Highway 299 north-northeast of the Gold Rush mining town of Weaverville. The Alpine scenery surrounding the lake makes up the Trinity Alps. The Alps were formed in the late Jurassic Period by volcanic activity in the form of ultramafic and granitic plutons (igneous rock formed from super-heated magma cooling under the surface of the earth), and tectonic activity (the super continent of Pangaea was beginning to pull apart into two separate super-sized continents) and glaciation during frigid climate periods known as ice ages (land surface modified by action of glaciers). The last remaining glaciers are on Thompson‚Äôs peak, at more than 9,000 feet. The lake bed was originally a series of deep valleys in the Alps.  History  The Discovery of Gold in 1848 prompted hundreds of miners to move into the area. Towns like Weaverville were born practically overnight. In 1958, a plan to divert water from Trinity River to California‚Äôs Central Valley led to the construction of Trinity Dam and the creation of Trinity Lake. This project was also designed to provide hydroelectric power to the local area. The Trinity River Division of the Central Valley Project came to fruition in 1961 with the completion of Trinity Dam. The lake was renamed Clair Engle Lake from 1964 to 1997. It was eventually renamed Trinity Lake. The lake was completely filled with water from the Trinity River by 1963 and is the third largest lake in California with 145 miles of shoreline. The area is known to have been inhabited by several Native American tribes, most notably the Yurok and Hupa (Hoopa). Both tribes have reservation lands in the area.  Recreation  View at Trinity Lake Trinity Lake is less used by vacationers than the lower Lake Shasta due in part to the lengthy winding road up from the valley floor. Typical drive time from Redding (Interstate 5) to the lake is about 90 minutes along a winding mountain road. This makes it a destination spot for fishing and water sports. Popular fishing includes that of smallmouth and largemouth bass, catfish, kokanee, rainbow and brown trout. Fish remain ample, despite the negative impact that the dams have had on spawning ground in part due to the Trinity River Fish Hatchery, located just below Lewiston Dam. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught in Trinity Lake based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in local species. House boating, speed boating, and waterskiing are also popular lake activities. Surrounding the lake, visitors enjoy hiking and camping in the pristine wilderness of the Trinity Alps and the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.  Wildlife  There has been a dramatic decline in various fish species in the river since the dams were built and the lake created. Spawning steelhead, Chinook and Coho Salmon populations have all been affected by their loss of spawning ground. However, wildlife populations surrounding the lake remain strong. Black bears are common, so proper precautions must be taken to secure campsites, throw away garbage and store food safely. Additional wildlife includes bobcats, mountain lions and many different bird species. The lake contains land-locked populations of kokanee salmon and king salmon, along with more typical California lake species such as largemouth and smallmouth bass, rainbow trout and catfish.

Brighton railway works (also known as Brighton locomotive works, or just the Brighton works) was one of the earliest railway-owned locomotive repair works, founded in 1840 by the London and Brighton Railway in Brighton, England, and thus pre- dating the more famous railway works at Crewe, Doncaster and Swindon. The works grew steadily between 1841 and 1900 but efficient operation was always hampered by the restricted site, and there were several plans to close it and move the facility elsewhere. Nevertheless, between 1852 and 1957 more than 1200 steam locomotives as well as prototype diesel electric and electric locomotives were constructed there, before the eventual closure of the facility in 1962. After use as a factory for constructing bubble cars, the facility was demolished and has since been redeveloped as part of the New England Quarter of Brighton. London and Brighton Railway The earliest locomotive servicing facility at Brighton was a small engine shed to the north-west of the station, serving the Brighton ‚Äì Shoreham line of the London and Brighton Railway in May 1840. The following year, with the completion of the London ‚Äì Brighton main line, the railway opened a larger repair facility and motive power depot on the eastern side of the main line adjacent to the Brighton railway station. However a new workshop at Horley, midway between London and Brighton, also opened in 1841, was then planned to become the principal locomotive and carriage workshop of the new railway.Griffiths (1999), pp. 79 London Brighton and South Coast Railway Following his appointment as the Locomotive Superintendent of the successor company, the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) in November 1847, John Chester Craven changed the plan of moving the works to Horley. Carriage construction began in 1848, having previously been carried out by contractors at New Cross.Gray (1977), p.123. Craven also set about enlarging and equipping Brighton works for new steam locomotive construction, which began in May 1852. However the situation of the works, close to the main line, on top of a cliff, in what would soon become a built-up area, always imposed restrictions on the space available for its efficient operation. =Expansion 1860‚Äì1900= During 1860 and 1861 Craven began the removal of a large chalk hill on the western side of the main line, which had been dumped during the construction of the main line. The space created was used to accommodate a new much enlarged motive power depot in 1861, thereby permitting the closure of the existing facilities and their incorporation into the works proper.Griffiths (1999), pp.69 Nevertheless, by 1866 consideration was again being given to concentrating repairs at New Cross Gate railway station. In the 1870s William Stroudley considered moving the works to the site at Horley once again, but instead moved the carriage repair shed and paint shops to new sites on the western side of the main line, and transferred the marine engineering work undertaken by the works to a new facility in Newhaven. This allowed for the further enlargement of the locomotive building and repair facilities, including the addition of an iron foundry in 1873, and a new carriage painting and cleaning shop in 1878, and a coppersmith's shop in 1881. 44.Marshall (1963), p.443. This new construction solved the problem for a while, but did not address the underlying issue of the inadequate site so that by the end of the century the works was again suffering from serious difficulties affecting its efficient operation. =Crisis at Brighton= From 1905 Brighton works was unable to keep pace with the locomotives requiring to be serviced, and backlogs began to build up. As a result, the LB&SCR; established concentrations of locomotives awaiting entry to the works or else scrapping at East Grinstead, Horsted Keynes and Horley. An outside investigation in 1908, conducted by Robert Urie, then Works Manager of Nine Elms Works found 108 of the LB&SCR;'s 541 locomotives (20%) were awaiting or under repair, and that a general overhaul at Brighton took 43 days, compared with 7.2% of the locomotives of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway under repair and 21 days taken by Ashford Works. By 1910 30% of the locomotive stock was unusable due to delays and inefficiencies at Brighton works. Lawson Billinton, the District Locomotive Superintendent at New Cross depot had sought to alleviate the situation by executing repairs and boiler changes, but this had little impact on the problem. The LB&SCR; Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent D.E. Marsh received much of the blame for the problem, which had been developing for some years, and he was granted leave of absence due to sickness in 1910, followed by his resignation in July 1911. Billinton had been invited to take over on a temporary basis during Marsh's sickness, and promptly set about re- organising the works and reducing the backlog by using emerging Time and motion study techniques.Marx, (2007), pp.9‚Äì10. =Plans to move the works= The LB&SCR; directors recognised that part of the problem at Brighton was that the works was overwhelmed with work. In 1910 they purchased land at Lancing for a new carriage and wagon works, which was opened in 1912. This allowed Stroudley's carriage shed to be used as an overflow 'stock shed' by the locomotive works and the motive power depot. Locomotives repaired at Brighton were also sometimes taken to Lancing for their final painting. Once confirmed in his post as Locomotive Superintendent in 1913 Billinton presented proposals to the LB&SCR; board to close Brighton works and concentrate all locomotive building and repair at a new facility adjacent to the carriage works at Lancing. However the advent of the First World War in 1914 put an end to this plan. Locomotive building was severely curtailed at Brighton after 1916 and the works became involved in munitions production. After the war there was again a substantial backlog of repairs and new construction did not resume until late 1920. Grouping & impending closure Following the grouping of the LB&SCR; and other railways in southern England to form the Southern Railway, in 1923, much of the new locomotive construction for the new railway was transferred to the more modern facilities at Eastleigh Works. After mid-1931, with the impending electrification of the Brighton main line, the locomotive works once again seemed likely to close. Many of the skilled workmen and much of the equipment were transferred to Eastleigh and Ashford, the Paint Shop was converted into an Electric multiple unit maintenance facility,Cooper (1981), pp. 86 and the former carriage shed was converted for use by the Southern Railway's new Road Motor Engineers Department. Similarly the steam motive power depot was rebuilt and reduced in size.Cooper (1981), pp. 58. =The Second World War and Revival= Fears of possible air attacks on Ashford and Eastleigh together with the need for more steam locomotive and armaments construction during World War II brought about the re-opening and re-equipment of the workshops in 1941. Throughout the remaining years of the war Brighton works was used for locomotive construction, initially for the Southern Railway, but also later for the War Department, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the London and North Eastern Railway. It also manufactured component parts for tanks and anti-aircraft guns. The workshops were damaged during the \\"Brighton Blitz\\" in May 1943 but soon repaired. British Railways and closure In the decade after the nationalisation of British Railways(BR) in 1948 Brighton works was again used for new locomotive construction, being responsible for both design work and construction of several of the new BR Standard classes. At the time of the centenary of locomotive building in 1952 the works covered and employed about 650 staff.Cooper (1981), p. 65 However, under the modernisation plan for BR announced in 1954, Brighton Works was once again passed over. Locomotive building ceased in 1957, and locomotive repairs ceased the following year. The buildings were closed in 1962 and demolished in 1969. The motive power depot was officially closed 15 June 1961, but remained in use for stabling steam locomotives until 1964, and was demolished in 1966. Later uses of the site After the closure of the main works, part of the workshop was used for the building of Isetta microcars between 1957 and 1964 and some of the land remained in railway use, associated with the stabling of electric multiple unit trains and other maintenance functions. Much of the land later became a large open car park, and was used for a popular market every Sunday morning. Some land on the eastern side was given over to an assortment of retail units including a number of car dealers with temporary structures being the predominant building type, and a strip below the yard was used for retail premises; behind these remained the stone and brick columns over which the yard had been extended when space was at a premium. Much of the land which was not suitable for use either by lock-up traders or for car parking or still in use by British Rail was left derelict. The final traces of the locomotive works vanished with the demolition of the elevated 1930s Southern Railway signal box in the mid-1980s, the signal box having used part of the main locomotive erecting-shop wall as support. In the early years of the 21st Century the site has finally seen redevelopment begin, and it lies at the heart of the New England Quarter. Organisation of the works A report of a visit to the works by members of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1947 described the arrangement of the works and the cranes and other mechanical equipment used. The works were then organised into: * a boiler shop (then building new boilers for SR West Country class) * an erecting shop (building West Country class locomotives and reconditioning of War Department \\"Austerity\\" locomotives for use on S.R. and L.N.E.R.) * a machine shop * a fitting shop to deal with the repairs to axle boxes, motion parts, boiler mountings, and other details. * a coppersmith * a pipe-fitting shop * a light plating shop (for building smokeboxes and boiler clothing) * a small welding shop to deal with welded details other than boilers * a small brass foundry The works was supplied with compressed air for pneumatic drilling, riveting, and chipping hammers; a hydraulic plant for the 250-ton plate flanging press and a 20-ton press; and both alternating and direct electric current.Grace‚Äôs Guide to British Industrial History: 1947 Institution of Mechanical Engineers: Visits to Works, www.gracesguide.co.uk/1947_Institution_of_Mechanical_Engineers:_Visits_to_Works (accessed 27/08/2015 Locomotive construction at Brighton The first locomotive to be constructed at Brighton was a 2-2-2, No.14.Larkin (1992), pp. 33 Thereafter Brighton works was responsible for the design and construction of a large proportion of the locomotives operated by the LB&SCR; under the engineers Craven, William Stroudley, R. J. Billinton, D. E. Marsh and L. B. Billinton. =London Brighton and South Coast Railway= Notable locomotive types constructed at Brighton included the A1 \\"Terrier\\" class, awarded a Gold medal at the 1870 Paris Exhibition, the B1 \\"Gladstone\\" class 0-4-2 (awarded a Gold medal at the 1889 Paris Exhibition), the D1 0-4-2T, the Billinton B4 4-4-0, and D3 0-4-4T classes, the Marsh H2 class 4-4-2, and L Class 4-6-4T. Locomotive building at Brighton ceased at the end of 1916 with the building of the last E2 0-6-0 tank, and five K class 2-6-0, and did not resume until late 1920, with further members of the K and L classes. The last locomotive to be built at the works by the LB&SCR; was L class No. 333 Remembrance. =Southern Railway= For the first three years of Southern Railway ownership no new locomotives were built at Brighton, although rebuilding of the B4 class into virtually new locomotives took place. During 1926 the works was responsible for building ten examples of Maunsell's \\"River class\\" and then rebuilding of six of them into \\"U class\\" 2-6-0 tender locomotives two years later. The works also built a further ten \\"U\\" class in 1928. The following year the works constructed all of the designer's Z class 0-8-0T locomotives, before locomotive construction again ceased. During the war years Brighton works built more than half of Bulleid's Q1 class 0-6-0 freight locomotives, and the drawing office was primarily responsible for the detailed designs of his revolutionary Merchant Navy 4-6-2 express passenger locomotives, although the locomotives were built at Eastleigh Works. From 1943 they built 93 of the LMS Stanier 8F type 2-8-0 freight locomotives for the War Department, at the incredible rate of one every 4.5 days. The heyday of locomotive building at the works was during the decade after the war, when Brighton built more than 100 Bulleid light pacifics of the West Country and Battle of Britain classes. The works also constructed the boilers and tenders for the final batch of ten Merchant Navy class, although the locomotives were constructed at Eastleigh.Bradley (1976), pp.26‚Äì7 The thousandth locomotive to be constructed at the works was 21C164 \\"Fighter Command\\" in June 1947.Bradley (1976), p. 60. This figure did not take into account 12 B4X class 4-4-0 from 1922‚Äì24 which were officially classified as rebuilds rather than new locomotives. =British Railways= The Leader being lifted onto its power bogies at Brighton, May 1949. During the early years of British Railways Brighton works constructed two further batches of \\"West Country\\" pacifics and would have been responsible for the entire class of 110 locomotives, had not the works become overstretched due to its involvement in the design and construction of Bulleid's problematic and ultimately ill-fated Leader class in 1949. Thereafter it was responsible for building 41 examples of the LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T for use on the Southern Region. In addition to the Leader class, other prototype locomotives constructed at Brighton included the third 3rd rail Co- Co electric locomotive, numbered 20003 in 1948, and the third 1Co-Co1 diesel electric locomotive numbered 10203 in 1954. Brighton staff were involved in the design of three of the most successful BR standard classes ‚Äì the class 4 4-6-0 tender, and class 4 2-6-4 tank classes together with the 9F 2-10-0 class ‚Äì and the works built 130 examples of the class 4 tank locomotives after 1951. In 1955 R.G. Jarvis, Chief Technical Assistant at the works, and his staff were responsible for the design of the highly successful rebuilds of the \\"Merchant Navy\\" and \\"West Country\\" classes, although the rebuilding took place at Eastleigh. New locomotive construction ceased in 1957 with the construction of BR standard class 4 tank 80154, which was the 1,211th locomotive to be constructed there. Other engineering work undertaken at Brighton works As mentioned above, the works undertook marine engineering for the railway until the mid-1870s and carriage construction until the opening of Lancing Carriage Works. In addition it constructed turntables and other heavy equipment for the railway. References Further reading *Bradley, D.L.

Some 3D model formats enable computer-aided manufacturing software to access PMI directly for CNC programming. The PMI also may be used by tolerance analysis and coordinate-measuring machine (CMM) software applications if the modeling application permits. PMI items are often organized within annotation views.

Prince is the leading global manufacturer of tennis rackets.Prince Sports Group, Inc. History on Funding Universe  History  The company was founded in 1970 by Robert H. McClure of Princeton, New Jersey (hence the name Prince) as a manufacturer of tennis ball machines, and went on to manufacture rackets. Howard Head, founder of the Head Ski Company, took tennis lessons following his retirement (his company was acquired by AMF in 1969). He used one of the tennis ball machines made by Prince, but was frustrated by his slow improvement in the game. Head joined the company in the early 1970s and developed the company's signature oversized tennis racket. Although the Prince Classic aluminum racket was the first oversized racquet to be patented, the Bentley Fortissimo preceded the patent by two years, causing Germany to invalidate it. During those years, the company was owned by a variety of different firms, including the Benetton Group of Italy,Chesebrough-Ponds on Funding Universe Lincoln Share Management, Inc (which acquired Prince from Benetton in 2003), and Nautic Partners LLC. (2007). In July 2012, Authentic Brands Group acquired the Prince brand name from Nautic Partners, in a procedure that filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Prince Sports' portfolio of brands included Prince (tennis, squash and badminton), Ektelon (racquetball) and Viking (platform/paddle tennis). Its tennis unit recorded $59 million in sales in 2011.

The ground is situated on Pearse Road in Ballyphehane. The ground was originally named after Jimmy Musgrave, a past-president of the Irish Rugby Football Union, with naming rights later sold to Independent News & Media in 2014. Owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), it is primarily used by Dolphin RFC, Sundays Well RFC, and Munster Rugby. History and development The ground was first purchased by the Munster Branch of the IRFU in the late 1930s, and in use by the early 1940s. Named for Jimmy Musgrave, a past-president of the IRFU, this early ground incorporated a small pavilion between two pitches. Terracing and seating were later added. Dolphin and Sunday's Well rugby clubs were tenants from the outset, though the ground also sometimes hosted provincial and international games. The latter included a number of notable Munster Rugby performances against touring international teams, including Australia (in 1967), the All Blacks (in 1973), and Australia (in 1992) when the then world-champions were defeated at the ground. By the early 21st century, the ground consisted of four terraces, one stand, three tribunes, a jogging track, and two VIP stands on the west side. This configuration provided a seating capacity of 3,450, with terracing giving a total capacity of approximately 9,000. It was announced in March 2010 that a new all-seated west stand, would bring capacity to over 12,500, however by February 2011 it was reported that this work would not go ahead - due to difficulty raising funding. Instead a 4,000 seat temporary stand was erected in the summer of 2011. Later in 2011 the old seated west stand was demolished and replaced by a temporary structure, giving an overall capacity of 10,000 with 4,000 seats. In March 2013 it was announced that a new permanent 3,300 seated west stand would be built. It would incorporate changing, medical, media and function rooms. The east terrace would also have a roof added as part of this development. To fund this development a 1.1 acre strip of land to the east of the site was made available for sale. When complete, the development would provide a ground capacity of 10,000 in total, phasing in from a capacity of approximately 8,000 from the initial reopening in January 2015. This ‚Ç¨3.2m investment and work took place between June 2014 and January 2015, and included a new west stand seating 3,500, with the east terrace being covered from endline to endline. Following a naming-rights deal with Independent News & Media, upon the planned reopening in early 2015, the ground was to be referred to as Irish Independent Park. Use =Rugby= line-out during a rugby match between Munster and Scarlets at Musgrave Park Musgrave Park is home to Dolphin RFC and Sundays Well RFC. Each club has their own pitch on the east side of the main stadium. The stadium hosts some of Munster Rugby's home fixtures. However Thomond Park, Limerick is the venue for all Heineken Champions Cup games. The ground also hosts some smaller Pro14 games and pre-season friendlies - including occasionally by Ireland A (Wolfhounds) teams. The stadium also hosts locally important games - such as finals for amateur cup competitions and schools rugby. It also hosted the home matches of the Ireland under-20 team during the 2019 Six Nations Under 20s Championship. =Other sports= In September 1991 League of Ireland club Cork City F.C. played a league game at Musgrave Park against Shamrock Rovers and the following Wednesday Cork City drew 1‚Äì1 with FC Bayern Munich in a UEFA Cup game played at the ground. =Concerts= Other events also take place at the venue, with for example a concert by Il Divo in June 2014, and a series of gigs by George Ezra, The Coronas, Liam Gallagher, Lauryn Hill and others during June 2019.

An ultrashort pulse of light, when travelling in a medium, will induce a varying refractive index of the medium due to the optical Kerr effect. This variation in refractive index will produce a phase shift in the pulse, leading to a change of the pulse's frequency spectrum. Self-phase modulation is an important effect in optical systems that use short, intense pulses of light, such as lasers and optical fiber communications systems. It has also been reported for nonlinear sound waves propagating in biological thin films, where the phase modulation results from varying elastic properties of the lipid films. Theory with Kerr nonlinearity The evolution along distance z of the equivalent lowpass electric field A(z) obeys the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation which, in absence of dispersion, is: :\\\\frac{dA(z)}{dz} = -j\\\\gamma \\\\left A(z)\\\\right^2 A(z) with j the imaginary unit and Œ≥ the nonlinear coefficient of the medium. The cubic nonlinear term on the right hand side is called Kerr effect, and is multiplied by -j according to the engineer's notation used in the definition of Fourier transform. The power of the electric field is invariant along z, since: :\\\\frac{d A^2}{dz}=\\\\frac{dA}{dz}A^* + A\\\\frac{dA^*}{dz} = 0 with * denoting conjugation. Since the power is invariant, the Kerr effect can manifest only as a phase rotation. In polar coordinates, with A=Ae^{j\\\\varphi}, it is: :\\\\frac{dA e^{j\\\\varphi}}{dz} = \\\\underbrace{\\\\frac{dA}{dz}}_{=0}e^{j\\\\varphi} + j Ae^{j\\\\varphi}\\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{dz} = -j\\\\gamma \\\\left A(z)\\\\right^3 e^{j\\\\varphi} such that: :\\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{dz} = -\\\\gammaA^2 . The phase œÜ at coordinate z therefore is: :\\\\varphi(z) = \\\\varphi(0) - \\\\underbrace{\\\\gamma\\\\left A(0) \\\\right^2 z}_{\\\\mathrm{SPM}} . Such a relation highlights that SPM is induced by the power of the electric field. In presence of attenuation Œ± the propagation equation is: :\\\\frac{dA(z)}{dz} = -\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}A(z) - j\\\\gamma \\\\left A(z)\\\\right^2 A(z) and the solution is: :A(z) = A(0) e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}z} e^{-j\\\\gammaA(0)^2 L_\\\\mathrm{eff}(z)} where L_\\\\mathrm{eff}(z) is called effective length and is defined by: :L_\\\\mathrm{eff}(z) = \\\\int_0^z e^{-\\\\alpha x} \\\\mathrm{d}x = \\\\frac{1 - e^{-\\\\alpha z}}{\\\\alpha} . Hence, with attenuation the SPM does not grow indefinitely along distance in a homogeneous medium, but eventually saturates to: :\\\\lim_{z\\\\rightarrow +\\\\infty} \\\\varphi(z) = \\\\varphi(0) - \\\\gammaA(0)^2 \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha} . In presence of dispersion the Kerr effect manifests as a phase shift only over short distances, depending on the amount of dispersion. SPM Frequency shift A pulse (top curve) propagating through a nonlinear medium undergoes a self-frequency shift (bottom curve) due to self-phase modulation. The front of the pulse is shifted to lower frequencies, the back to higher frequencies. In the centre of the pulse the frequency shift is approximately linear. For an ultrashort pulse with a Gaussian shape and constant phase, the intensity at time t is given by I(t): :I(t) = I_0 \\\\exp \\\\left(- \\\\frac{t^2}{\\\\tau^2} \\\\right) where I0 is the peak intensity, and œÑ is half the pulse duration. If the pulse is travelling in a medium, the optical Kerr effect produces a refractive index change with intensity: :n(I) = n_0 + n_2 \\\\cdot I where n0 is the linear refractive index, and n2 is the second- order nonlinear refractive index of the medium. As the pulse propagates, the intensity at any one point in the medium rises and then falls as the pulse goes past. This will produce a time-varying refractive index: :\\\\frac{dn(I)}{dt} = n_2 \\\\frac{dI}{dt} = n_2 \\\\cdot I_0 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{-2 t}{\\\\tau^2} \\\\cdot \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-t^2}{\\\\tau^2} \\\\right). This variation in refractive index produces a shift in the instantaneous phase of the pulse: :\\\\phi(t) = \\\\omega_0 t - kz = \\\\omega_0 t - \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi}{\\\\lambda_0} \\\\cdot n(I) L where \\\\omega_0 and \\\\lambda_0 are the carrier frequency and (vacuum) wavelength of the pulse, and L is the distance the pulse has propagated. The phase shift results in a frequency shift of the pulse. The instantaneous frequency œâ(t) is given by: :\\\\omega(t) = \\\\frac{d \\\\phi(t)}{dt} = \\\\omega_0 - \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi L}{\\\\lambda_0} \\\\frac{dn(I)}{dt}, and from the equation for dn/dt above, this is: :\\\\omega(t) = \\\\omega_0 + \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi L n_2 I_0}{\\\\lambda_0 \\\\tau^2} \\\\cdot t \\\\cdot \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-t^2}{\\\\tau^2}\\\\right). Plotting œâ(t) shows the frequency shift of each part of the pulse. The leading edge shifts to lower frequencies (\\"redder\\" wavelengths), trailing edge to higher frequencies (\\"bluer\\") and the very peak of the pulse is not shifted. For the centre portion of the pulse (between t = ¬±œÑ/2), there is an approximately linear frequency shift (chirp) given by: :\\\\omega(t) = \\\\omega_0 + \\\\alpha \\\\cdot t where Œ± is: :\\\\alpha = \\\\left. \\\\frac{d\\\\omega}{dt} \\\\right _0 = \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi L n_2 I_0}{\\\\lambda_0 \\\\tau^2}. It is clear that the extra frequencies generated through SPM broaden the frequency spectrum of the pulse symmetrically. In the time domain, the envelope of the pulse is not changed, however in any real medium the effects of dispersion will simultaneously act on the pulse. In regions of normal dispersion, the \\"redder\\" portions of the pulse have a higher velocity than the \\"blue\\" portions, and thus the front of the pulse moves faster than the back, broadening the pulse in time. In regions of anomalous dispersion, the opposite is true, and the pulse is compressed temporally and becomes shorter. This effect can be exploited to some degree (until it digs holes into the spectrum) to produce ultrashort pulse compression. A similar analysis can be carried out for any pulse shape, such as the hyperbolic secant-squared (sech2) pulse profile generated by most ultrashort pulse lasers. If the pulse is of sufficient intensity, the spectral broadening process of SPM can balance with the temporal compression due to anomalous dispersion and reach an equilibrium state. The resulting pulse is called an optical soliton.  Applications of SPM  Self-phase modulation has stimulated many applications in the field of ultrashort pulse including to cite a few: * spectral broadening and supercontinuum * temporal pulse compression * spectral pulse compression The nonlinear properties of Kerr nonlinearity has also been beneficial for various optical pulse processing techniques such as optical regeneration or wavelength conversion. Mitigation strategies in DWDM systems In long-haul single- channel and DWDM systems, SPM is one of the most important reach-limiting nonlinear effects. It can be reduced by: * Lowering the optical power at the expense of decreasing the optical signal-to-noise ratio * Dispersion management, because dispersion can partly mitigate the SPM effect See also Other non-linear effects: * Cross-phase modulation ‚Äî XPM * Four wave mixing ‚Äî FWM * Modulational instability‚Äî MI * Stimulated Raman scattering ‚Äî SRS Applications of SPM: * Supercontinuum * Mamyshev 2R regenerator Notes and references Category:Optics Category:Nonlinear optics ","title":"Self-phase modulation"},{"id":"2612482","text":"Coloured etching of Dr. Slop with his wig on fire angrily gesticulating to Susannah, who holds her nose near the wounded baby. Dr Slop is a choleric physician and \\"man-midwife\\" in Laurence Sterne's novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759). The doctor is summoned by Tristram Shandy's father to attend his son's imminent birth. Slop makes his first appearance in Chapter 34 of the novel, where he is described as: :\\"... a little squat, uncourtly figure ... about four feet and a half perpendicular height, with a breadth of back, and a sesquipedality of belly, which might have done honour to a serjeant in the horse-guards.\\" He is portrayed as an incompetent quack, arriving at Shandy Hall having forgotten his array of \\"vile instruments\\" and \\"obstetrical engines\\", which have to be urgently sent for. In performing a forceps delivery of the baby, Slop damages the infant Tristram's nose, much to his father's consternation, and is obliged to perform a rudimentary rhinoplasty using cotton thread and a piece of whalebone from a maid's corset. Dr. Slop arriving at the home of Tristram Shandy Sterne partially based the character of Slop on Dr John Burton (1710‚Äì71), author of An Essay towards a Complete System of Midwifery (1751), in which the engraved plates are the earliest published work of George Stubbs. Burton, a Catholic and a Jacobite sympathiser, had fallen foul of Sterne's uncle, the Rev. Jacques Sterne DD, who had Burton arrested upon suspicion of sedition during the rebellion of 1745. Slop has been listed as one of the \\"Ten Best Bad Doctors\\" in literature. The doctor's involvement in the birth of Tristram and the resulting facial mutilation is in keeping with the obstetrical blunders of the time. His presence reflects a general level of concern on behalf of husbands for the safety of their wives, given the dogmatic and often harmful notions put forth in treatises intended to instruct midwives on the topic, to which doctors were not necessarily beholden. The usage of forceps on the part of doctors is one such instance where the two parties diverged. However, it must not be forgotten that Dr. Slop's inclusion in the delivery drama was a result of Walter Shandy's insistence on the podalic version of Tristram's fetus. The traumatic outcome of the birth is ultimately indicative of the hazardous nature of childbirth at the time as well as the inadequacy (sloppiness) of those at the cutting edge of the medical profession.

He is described by The Nuttall Encyclop√¶dia as a \\"self- satisfied night constable\\" with an inflated view of his own importance as the leader of a group of comically bumbling police watchmen. Dogberry is notable for his numerous malapropisms, which sometimes are referred to as \\"dogberryisms\\" or \\"dogberrys\\" after him. The Dogberry character was created for William Kempe, who played comic roles in Shakespeare's theatre company the Lord Chamberlain's Men. In the play In the play, Dogberry is the chief of the citizen-police in Messina. He is first seen instructing his constables on their duties. He tells them that it's perfectly fine to sleep on duty, and that if they see a thief, they should not touch him, to avoid becoming defiled by association with crime.Draper, John W., Stratford to Dogberry: Studies in Shakespeare's Earlier Plays, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, 1961, pp.273‚Äì5. During their watch the constables overhear a conversation between two characters, Boraccio and Conrade, one of whom has been part of Don John's plot to discredit Hero. They misunderstand the conversation and arrest the two on the spot for acts of \\"treason\\" because they called the Prince's brother Don John a villain. They are brought before the governor Leonato, who is at a loss to understand Dogberry's nonsensical description of the supposed crimes, but allows Dogberry to examine them. His absurd pseudo-legal rhetoric confuses matters even more, but when the Prince arrives at the truth about Don John, the plot is revealed and the arrested man confesses. Dogberry is rewarded for his diligence and leaves. Comic persona As is usual in Shakespearean comedy, and Renaissance comedy generally, he is a figure of comic incompetence. The humour of Dogberry‚Äôs character is his frequent use of malapropism, a product of his pretentiousness, as he attempts to use sophisticated terminology with disastrous results. The name of the character is the Elizabethan common name for the fruit of the common dogwood (Cornus sanguine), considered lowly and inferior to other edible berries. Shakespeare appears to be poking mild fun at the amateur police forces of his day, in which respectable citizens spent a fixed number of nights per year fulfilling an obligation to protect the public peace, a job for which they were, by and large, unqualified. Dogberry and his crew, however, are also given a thematic function, for it is they who (accidentally) uncover the plot of Don John and begin the process of restoration that leads to the play's happy conclusion. In that sense, Dogberry's comic ineptitude is made to serve the sense of a providential force overseeing the fortunate restoration of social and emotional order. In addition to frequent malapropism, Dogberry provides the list of charges as a numbered list out of order comprising redundant items: :Marry, sir, they have committed false report; :moreover, they have spoken untruths; :secondarily, they are slanders; :sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady; :thirdly, they have verified unjust things; :and, to conclude, they are lying knaves. and, in trying to make sure that the criminals' insulting of him is recorded in the evidence against them, Dogberry repeatedly insists that it be written down that \\"[he is] an ass.\\" Implying that fact only makes his case worse and adds humor to the story. Elizabethan law enforcement According to historian John W. Draper, Dogberry's behaviour as constable is an exaggeration of genuine problems with the amateur policing system at the time, in which sleeping during the night-watch was common, and watchmen often tried to avoid confronting criminals. Though the play is nominally set in Sicily, Dogberry's watch appear to be acting under English law of the period, according to which loiterers at night could be arrested under the catch-all charge of vagrancy. Indeed, that would be the legal basis for arresting Boraccio and Conrade: \\"Though they do not say so, they were in reality arresting the men as vagrants according to Dogberry's injunction\\". Notable performers Dogberry was almost certainly created to be performed by William Kempe, as the names \\"Kemp\\" and \\"Kem\\" are sometimes accidentally substituted for the character-name in the published version of the play.J. Madison Davis, Daniel A. Frankforter, \\"Dogberry\\", The Shakespeare Name Dictionary, Routledge, 2004. Dogberry was played by the noted comedy actor Samuel Johnson during the 1880s and 1890s for Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre in London. John Martin- Harvey described him as the acknowledged Shakespearean clown of his day, and his portrayal of Dogberry (1882 and 1893) reflects this claim.Productions of Much Ado About Nothing ‚Äì Shakespeare and the Players websiteJohnson as Dogberry ‚Äì Henry Irving Correspondence websiteJ.

Built in 1890. The Westinghouse Air Brake Company (sometimes nicknamed or abbreviated WABCO although this was also confusingly used for spinoffs) was founded on September 28, 1869 by George Westinghouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Earlier in the year he had invented the railway air brake in New York state. After having manufactured equipment in Pittsburgh for a number of years, he began to construct facilities and plants east of the city where homes for his employees were built. In 1889, the air brake manufacturing facility was moved to Wilmerding, Pennsylvania, and the company's general office building was built there in 1890. WABCO's direct successor companies include WABCO Vehicle Control Systems, a commercial vehicle air brake manufacturer; and Wabtec, a railway equipment manufacturer, which have been owned and operated independently of each other since the mid- twentieth century.  History  thumbWestinghouse Air Brake Company's Rotair Valve The Westinghouse Air Brake Company was established by George Westinghouse in 1869. In 1889, the Air Brake plant was moved to Wilmerding, Pennsylvania, a small farming town located 14 miles outside of Pittsburgh.Life in Wilmerding, ‚ÄúThe Air Brake City‚Äù the Ideal Hometown. Wilmerding News, 2 September.4. At the time, was only inhabited by about 5,000 people. Socialism was strong in Wilmerding, and it was thought to be ‚ÄúThe Ideal Town‚Äù for the company because of its location immediately adjacent to the Pennsylvania Railroad and its mainly blue-collar inhabitants. In the 1890s, the Air Brake Company employed 3,000 citizens from the surrounding Pittsburgh area, but the bulk of its workforce consisted of the firm's employees lived in the vicinity of Wilmerding. Wilmerding developed rapidly around this new and growing company, and the town soon became known for this industry. A little under one third of its population was somehow related, and more often than not one would end up raising their children in the same home that they were raised in. Local business prospered as well.Richard Shumaker, \\"A View from Our Porch.\\" George Westinghouse Museum. 1-3. Many of the passengers that were departing from or coming into Wilmerding stopped to shop at these stores along the narrow sidewalk before heading home. Working conditions at the Westinghouse Air Brake Company (WA&B;) were more than adequate, and the company instituted new policies for its employees. For example, in 1869, it was one of the first companies to institute a 9-hour work day and a 55-hour work week, at a time when typical working days spanned between 10 and 12 hours (and sometimes more), and where a 60-hour work week was only considered moderate. WA&B; also got the reputation for being the first industry in America to adopt half holidays on Saturday afternoons. Various benefit options were also instituted in order to improve the working and living conditions of the firm's employees. The Air Brake plant prospered, and the surrounding community thrived alongside it. By 1905, over two million freight, passenger, mail, baggage, and express cars and 89,000 locomotives were equipped with Westinghouse Air Brakes. However, business was seasonally variable, and there were dips as well. Wilmerding men complained that, during the non-busy season, half routinely found themselves unemployed. This was not surprising, given that Wilmerding was a one-industry town, and thus unprofitable periods translated directly into a lower standard of living in the area. In the early 1900s, the Westinghouse Company built houses on a tract of land that it had purchased. In turn, it then sold those homes to its workers at an economical price. The company also offered educational and cultural activities, usually run through the local Y.M.C.A, to obtain better workers. Additionally, WA&B; catered to its workers who lost their ability to work, by providing an early form of a disability insurance plan. To insure a certain income to employees who might have been unfit for work because of illness or injury, an ordered sum would be paid to the beneficiary. Any employee under 50 was eligible for membership after a physical examination. The members contributed according to the class which they belonged to, with their class being determined by the amount of money they made per month. Their contribution ranged from fifty cents to $1.50, which in turn (in case of disability) would pay out benefits for thirty-nine consecutive weeks. According to Wilmerding News during this time, about 76% of WA&B;'s employees held a plan membership with the company. The Westinghouse Air Brake company continued producing products in Wilmerding, with various managers over the years. However, with the shedding of Pittsburgh's industrial past, the company had become proportionally less important.Laurent Belsie, \\"Westinghouse identity Shift Echoes Pittsburgh‚Äôs,\\" Christian Science Monitor, 15 November 1996, 9. =Successors WABCO Holdings and Wabtec= The company has two 21st century successors, which are independent of each other. One, which continues to design and manufacture railway air brakes in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania, merged with locomotive manufacturer MotivePower Industries, to form Wabtec. The other, now known as WABCO Holdings, Inc., designs and manufactures control systems for commercial road vehicles, including air brakes, and is headquartered in Bern, Switzerland. WABCO Holdings, Inc. was floated in a 2007 initial public offering by American Standard, WABCO's owners for 30 years. On 28th March 2019, it was publicly announced that WABCO Holdings, Inc. was to be bought by ZF Friedrichshafen for a price of $7 billion US dollars, with $136.50 per share in an all-cash transaction. This purchase-and-merger work took place in 2020. The United States Department of Justice stipulated that WABCO's North American heavy-vehicle steering components business (chiefly R.H. Sheppard Company, as acquired in 2017), had to be sold in order to preserve competition in this field. United States Department of Justice, press release.

Development of Westinghouse Air Brake =The straight air brake= The first form of the air brake consisted of an air pump, a main reservoir (pressure vessel), and an engineer's valve on the locomotive, and of a train pipe and brake cylinder on each car. One problem with this first form of the air brake was that braking was applied to the first cars in a train much sooner than to the rear cars, resulting in shocks and damages when the rear cars bunted against the cars ahead of them. The main objection, however, was that it was not an automatic brake, i.e. even a minor mishap like a broken coupling left the entire train without any brake power at all. =The plain automatic air brake= In 1872, George Westinghouse invented the automatic air brake by inventing the triple valve and by equipping each car with its own air cylinder. Air pressure is maintained in the auxiliary reservoirs and in the train pipe at all times when the brakes are not applied. An equilibrium of air pressure is maintained in the train pipe and in the auxiliary air cylinders. To apply the brakes to all of the cars at about the same time, pressure is released from the train pipe, causing the triple valve on each car to apply the brakes. To release the brakes on each car, pressure is increased in the train pipe until an excess pressure above that of the pressure in each auxiliary cylinder is reached, which throws the triple valve so as to close the inlet to the brake cylinder and open the inlet to the auxiliary reservoir from the train pipe, thus allowing the equilibrium of the two pressures to be reached. =The quick action triple valve= Although the plain automatic air brake was a great improvement over the straight air brake, in an emergency the system still applied the brakes to the last cars in a train later than to the first cars in a train. To remedy that condition, George Westinghouse invented the quick action triple valve in 1887. This triple valve system was tested by George Westinghouse on the CB&Q; West Burlington hill (Iowa) during 1887. It automatically vents air from the brake pipe locally on each car, which applies the brakes more quickly. =Electric railways= For the air brake to be employed on electric railways, an air compressor that is powered by electricity is required. Powerful electric locomotives were produced by the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company and by other companies.

She is a young grisette in Paris who becomes pregnant by a rich student. After he abandons her, she is forced to look after their child, Cosette, on her own. Originally a beautiful and naive girl, Fantine is eventually forced by circumstances to become a prostitute, selling her hair and front teeth, losing her beauty and health. The money she earns is sent to support her daughter. She was first played in the musical by Rose Laurens in France, and when the musical came to England, Patti LuPone played Fantine in the West End. Fantine has since been played by numerous actresses. Fantine became an archetype of self-abnegation and devoted motherhood. She has been portrayed by many actresses in stage and screen versions of the story and has been depicted in works of art.  In the novel  = Description = Hugo introduces Fantine as one of four fair girls attached to young, wealthy students. \\"She was called Fantine because she had never been known by any other name...\\" She is described as having, \\"gold and pearls for her dowry; but the gold was on her head and the pearls in her mouth.\\" Hugo elaborates: \\"Fantine was fair, without being too conscious of it. She was fair in the two ways‚Äîstyle and rhythm. Style is the form of the ideal, rhythm is its movement.\\" = Tholomy√®s and Cosette = Fantine is passionately in love with F√©lix Tholomy√®s, one of a quartet of students. One day, the four men invite their four lovers on an outing. They finish the day at a restaurant, only for the women to be abandoned by the men with a goodbye note. While the other three girls take it in good humor and laugh it off, Fantine later feels heartbroken. Tholomy√®s had fathered their illegitimate daughter Cosette, and Fantine is left to care for her alone. = The Th√©nardiers = By the time Cosette is approximately three, Fantine arrives at Montfermeil and meets the Th√©nardiers who are owners of an inn. She asks them to care for Cosette when she sees their daughters √âponine and Azelma playing outside. They agree to do so as long as she sends them money to provide for her. Fantine's only will to live is keeping Cosette alive. She becomes a worker in Mayor Madeleine's (a.k.a. Jean Valjean's) factory in her hometown of Montreuil-sur-Mer, and has a public letter-writer compose her letters to the Th√©nardiers for her because she is illiterate. However, she is unaware that the Th√©nardiers severely abuse Cosette and have forced her to be a slave for their inn. She is also unaware that the letters they send to her requesting financial help for Cosette are their own fraudulent way to extort money from her for themselves. = Loss of work = Fantine is fired by a meddlesome supervisor, Madame Victurnien, without the knowledge of the mayor, when she finds out that Fantine is an unwed mother. Fantine begins to work at home, earning twelve sous a day while Cosette's lodging costs ten. Her overworking causes her to become sick with a cough and fever. She also rarely goes out, fearing the disgrace she would face from the townspeople. The Th√©nardiers then send a letter stating they need ten francs so they can \\"buy\\" a woolen skirt for Cosette. To buy the skirt herself, Fantine has her hair cut off and sold. She then says to herself \\"My child is no longer cold, I have clothed her with my hair.\\" However, she soon begins to despise the mayor for her misfortunes. She later takes on a lover, only for him to beat her and then abandon her. The Th√©nardiers send another letter saying they need forty francs to buy medicine for Cosette who has become \\"ill.\\" Desperate for the money, Fantine has her two front teeth removed and sells them. = Prostitution = Fantine at Javert's feet Meanwhile, Fantine's health and her own lodging debts worsen while the Th√©nardiers' letters continue to grow and their financial demands become more costly. In order to continue to earn money for Cosette, Fantine becomes a prostitute. During a January evening, a dandy called Bamatabois heckles her and shoves snow down the back of her dress when she ignores him. Fantine ferociously attacks him. Javert, the town's police inspector, immediately arrests her while Bamatabois sneaks away. She begs to be let go, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean arrives to help Fantine, but upon seeing him she spits in his face. Dismissing the act, Valjean orders Javert to free Fantine, which he reluctantly does. Valjean comes to find out the reasons Fantine became a prostitute and why she attacked Bamatabois. He feels sorry for the innocent Fantine and Cosette, and tells her that he will retrieve Cosette for her. He sends Fantine to the hospital, as she is suffering from tuberculosis. = Death = After Valjean reveals his true identity at Champmathieu's trial, he goes back to see Fantine at the hospital. She asks about Cosette, and the doctor lies to her saying that Cosette is at the hospital but cannot see Fantine until her health improves. She is appeased by this, and even mistakenly thinks that she hears Cosette laughing and singing. Suddenly, she and Valjean see Javert at the door. Valjean tries to privately ask Javert for three days to obtain Cosette, but he loudly refuses. Fantine realizes that Cosette was never retrieved and frantically asks where she is. Javert impatiently yells at Fantine to be silent, and additionally, tells her Valjean's true identity. Shocked by these revelations, she suffers a severe fit of trembling, falls back on her bed and dies. Valjean then walks to Fantine, whispers to her and kisses her hand. After Valjean is taken into custody, Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public grave. Later on, after escaping imprisonment, Valjean rescues Cosette and raises her on Fantine's behalf. Character The death of Fantine; Valjean (as Mayor Madeleine) closes her eyes. Fantine has been interpreted as a holy prostitute figure who becomes a quintessential mother by sacrificing her own body and dignity for the purpose of securing the life of her child. She is an example of what has been called \\"the clich√© of the saved and saintly prostitute that pervades nineteenth-century fiction\\", which is also found in the writings of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy and Charles Dickens. Oscar Wilde presented her as a figure whose suffering makes her lovable, writing of the scene after she has her teeth removed, that \\"We run to kiss the bleeding mouth of Fantine\\". Kathryn M. Grossman says she moves into a form of \\"maternal sainthood\\" and that \\"When Madeleine (Valjean's pseudonym as mayor) affirms that she has remained virtuous and holy before God, Fantine can finally release her hatred and love others again. Or rather, it is because he perceives the reality beyond her appearance that she finds the mayor worthy of renewed devotion. For Valjean, the bedraggled prostitute verges on 'sanctity' through 'martyrdom' (640; saintet√© . . . martyr).\\" John Andrew Frey argues that the character has a political significance. Fantine is \\"an example of how women of the proletariat were brutalized in nineteenth-century France...Fantine represents Hugo's deep compassion for human suffering, especially for women born into low estate\\". Mario Vargas Llosa takes a less positive view, arguing that Hugo in effect punishes Fantine for her sexual transgression by making her suffer so horribly. \\"What disasters follow from a sin of the flesh! On the matter of sex, the morality of Les Mis√©rables melds perfectly with the most intolerant and puritanical interpretation of Catholic morality.\\" Fantine's image as a saint-like symbol of female victimhood appears in the writings of the union leader Eugene V. Debs, founder of the Industrial Workers of the World. In 1916 he wrote the essay Fantine in our Day, in which he compared the sufferings of Fantine to abandoned women of his own day:  In the musical  In the stage musical of the same name, Fantine is one of the central characters. = Differences in the musical = * Fantine's relationship with Cosette's father lasts a matter of months (\\"He slept a summer by my side...He filled my days with endless wonder...He took my childhood in his stride...But he was gone when autumn came\\"). In the novel, they are together for three years, and Cosette is already two years old when Fantine is abandoned. * Rather than being fired by a female supervisor for being an unwed mother, a fellow female worker steals her letter from the Th√©nardiers claiming another need for money; the worker presumes that she is a prostitute to cover her debts with the low wages. Valjean sees this, but leaves this to his foreman; the foreman, his advances having been rejected by Fantine, fires her. * Fantine is not illiterate and does not sell her teeth, but she does sell two teeth in the film adaptation of the musical, as in the novel (\\"You'll get twice if I take two\\", the doctor sang implying they took two teeth.) * Bamatabois wants to buy Fantine's services, and is angered when she rejects his advances. In the novel, he is a young layabout who humiliates her by putting snow down her dress as if she is an object of fun. * Fantine dies peacefully in hospital with Valjean at her side after entrusting him with Cosette. Javert never reveals Valjean's true identity to her, as he arrives after her death. * Fantine appears as a ghost to accompany Valjean to Heaven. In the novel, by contrast, Valjean describes her to Cosette on his deathbed.

It was developed in Maputo, the capital city of Mozambique, during the 1930s and 1940s. Etymology The name may be derived from the Portuguese word rebentar (arrabentar in the local vernacular), which means \\"to break\\". This may refer to the cheap musical instruments used in this music, which are often played energetically until they fall apart. Vocalist Dilon Djindji claims this refers to the energetic performances he delivered while on tour across Mozambique, as the intensity and vitality of his shows led audiences to believe that he was 'breaking' the emotional limits of those in attendance. The musicians who played Marrabenta came to be called arrabenta. Over time, the name Marrabenta has grown in popularity and continues to be used today. History Marrabenta gained national popularity in Mozambique during the 1930s and 1940s while the nation was still under Portuguese colonial rule. Before the popularity of Marrabenta, Portuguese musicians in Mozambique played fado, a type of traditional Portuguese folk music. These musicians introduced the traditional orchestration and other influences of fado, such as the use of guitars, mandolins, drum sets, and other conventional Western instruments, to Mozambique. The Catholic Church, as a site for cultural interaction, also played a role in the development of the new genre, contributing influences of tonal harmony and the basic use of progressions like I-IV-V. Mozambican musicians combined the influences of church music, secular Western music, and African rhythms to create an entirely new genre. Dance rhythms are a primary feature of traditional African music. In trying to duplicate these traditional sounds on new western instruments, Mozambican musicians created a new style of dance music, which quickly gained popularity among the youth in the 1940s. In 1977, Mozambique experienced a civil war. The government, viewing marrabenta as a way for people to express their dissent, shut down many music venues at the time. While Marrabenta's popularity began to decline during the Mozambican Civil War, it never disappeared. Fleeing the war to seek a better life and economic opportunities, many Mozambicans, including several Marrabenta musicians, migrated to South Africa. This introduced South African musical styles such as Kwela and Xangana to the Marrabenta style, adding rhythmic variety to the genre. Upon gaining independence from Portuguese colonial rule, Mozambique came under the control of a socialist regime, resulting in new musical influences from communist Cuba. When Mozambique ceased to be a socialist country in the 1980s, Western musical influences flooded the country. These included rock and pop mainly from the United States. During this time, Marrabenta underwent significant transformation as musicians started using distortion and electronic instruments, while retaining the fundamental character of the music. Style The Marrabenta style is a blend of traditional Mozambican rhythms and Portuguese folk music with influences from Western popular music that were brought over by radio. Early Marrabenta artists, such as Fany Pfumo, Dilon Djindji, and Wazimbo, were crucial in establishing the genre, which has evolved over time into its modern form. This evolution can be seen in Marrabenta bands such as Eyuphuro and Orchestra Marrabenta Star de Mo√ßambique. In its contemporary form, it has combined with other pop genres. The Mozambican band Mabulu mixes marrabenta and hip hop music. The genre is celebrated annually in the Marrabenta Festival in Maputo. Contemporary form Today, Marrabenta reflects global influences, including rhythm & blues, reggae, and blues. This has led to the emergence of a number of subgenres within Marrabenta, including pandza, which is a mix of reggae and Marrabenta and is currently very popular among the Mozambican youth. Marrabenta has also spread to other parts of Africa and the world.

However, a limited number of BIA decisions are selected for publication in the Administrative Decisions under the Immigration and Nationality Laws of the United States. There are currently 28 volumes of administrative precedent decisions under the Immigration and Nationality laws encompassing decisions dating back to 1940. BIA precedent decisions are legally binding on all components of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). A precedent decision may be overruled by a published decision of the Attorney General, by a Federal court, by a subsequent BIA precedent decision, or by a change in the law. The BIA is located in Bailey's Crossroads, Virginia, and, as of April 2009, had 14 board members, who are administrative judges appointed by the U.S. Attorney General. The size of the full BIA varies from time to time, depending on resignations, retirements, and new appointments; it may have up to fifteen board members under the current authorizing legislation. Decisions issued by the BIA are by three-member panels in limited circumstances. Otherwise, the vast majority of cases are decided by single panel members. A single panel member can also use a process called summary affirmance, which is used in 10 percent of cases (as of 2008), to affirm the lower court without issuing a written decision.; Fact Sheet: BIA Restructuring and Streamlining Procedures ; Fact Sheet: EOIR‚Äôs Improvement Measures ‚Äì‚Äì Progress Overview The BIA is notable in that one need not be an attorney to appear before it representing a client. However, non- attorneys must be part of a BIA-recognized organization (generally a nonprofit), and also have obtained BIA accreditation as individuals. A practice manual for appearing before the BIA is available from the U.S. Department of Justice. A handbook explaining the accreditation and recognition process is available from the nonprofit Catholic Legal Immigration Network (CLINIC).

The Unicorn, an English merchant ship, sank near Macau and the Portuguese dredged up sakers (cannon) from the ships and sold those to China around 1620, where they were reproduced as Hongyipao. *27 June 1637: Four heavily armed ships under Captain John Weddell, arrived at Macao in an attempt to open trade between England and China. They were not backed by the East India Company, but rather by a private group led by Sir William Courteen, including King Charles I's personal interest of ¬£10,000. They were opposed by the Portuguese authorities in Macao (as their agreements with China required) and quickly infuriated the Ming authorities. Later, in the summer, they easily captured one of the Bogue forts, and spend several weeks engaged in low-level fighting and smuggling. After being forced to seek Portuguese help in the release of three hostages, they left the Pearl River on 27 December. It is unclear whether they returned home..

Changbai Shan during a visit to Portsmouth in 2015 The United Kingdom and the anti-Communist Nationalist Chinese government were allies during World War II. Britain sought stability in China after the war to protect its more than ¬£300 million in investments, much more than from the United States. It agreed in the Moscow Agreement of 1945 to not interfere in Chinese affairs but sympathised with the Nationalists, who until 1947 were winning the Chinese Civil War against the Communist Party of China. By August 1948, however, the Communists' victories caused the British government to begin preparing for a Communist takeover of the country. It kept open consulates in Communist-controlled areas and rejected the Nationalists' requests that British citizens assist in the defence of Shanghai. By December, the government concluded that although British property in China would likely be nationalised, British traders would benefit in the long run from a stable, industrialising Communist China. Retaining Hong Kong was especially important; although the Communists promised to not interfere with its rule, Britain reinforced the Hong Kong Garrison during 1949. When the victorious Communist government declared on 1 October 1949 that it would exchange diplomats with any country that ended relations with the Nationalists, Britain‚Äîafter discussions with other Commonwealth members and European countries‚Äîformally recognised the People's Republic of China in January 1950. *20 April 1949 - The People's Liberation Army attacks travelling to the British Embassy in Nanjing in the Amethyst incident.

China Southern also flies between Heathrow and Wuhan. Among China's other airlines; Hainan Airlines flies between Manchester and Beijing, Beijing Capital Airlines offers Heathrow to Qingdao, while Tianjin Airlines offers flights between Tianjin, Chongqing and Xi'an to London-Gatwick. Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific also flies between Hong Kong to Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester. The British flag carrier British Airways flies to just three destinations in China; Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, and in the past Chengdu. Rival Virgin Atlantic flies between Heathrow to Shanghai and Hong Kong. British Airways has mentioned that it is interested in leasing China's new Comac C919 in its pool of aircraft of Boeing and Airbus. = Rail Transport = In January 2017, China Railways and DB Cargo launched the Yiwu-London Railway Line connecting the city of Yiwu and the London borough of Barking, and creating the longest railway freight line in the world. Hong Kong's MTR runs the London's TfL Rail service and has a 30% stake in South Western Railway. In 2017, train manufacturer CRRC won a contract to build 71 engineering wagons for London Underground. This is the first time a Chinese manufacturer has won a railway contract.  Culture & Media  Both countries are major cultural powerhouses. Although the UK is more established in this regard than China, the latter is an emerging cultural superpower. Much of the lack of cultural links between the two nations is due to differences in language and local restrictions. A strong exception exists for Hong Kong due to the region's former links with the UK as a crown colony. = Press = The weekly-published Europe edition of China Daily is available in a few newsagents in the UK, and on occasions a condensed version called China Watch is published in the Daily Telegraph. The monthly NewsChina, the North American English-language edition of China Newsweek (‰∏≠ÂõΩÊñ∞ÈóªÂë®Âàä) is available in a few branches of WHSmith. Due to local censorship, British newspapers and magazines are not widely available in Mainland China, however the Economist and Financial Times are available in Hong Kong. British \\"China Hands\\" like Carrie Gracie, Isabel Hilton and Martin Jacques occasionally write opinion pieces in many British newspapers and political magazines about China, often to try and explain about Middle Kingdom. = Radio and Television = Like the press, China has a limited scope in the broadcasting arena. In radio, the international broadcaster China Radio International broadcasts in English over shortwave which isn't widely taken up and also on the internet. The BBC World Service is available in China by shortwave as well, although it is often jammed (See Radio jamming in China). In Hong Kong, the BBC World Service is relayed for eight hours overnight on RTHK Radio 4 which on a domestic FM broadcast. On television, China broadcasts both its two main English-language news channels CGTN and CNC World. CGTN is available as a streaming channel on Freeview, while both are available on Sky satellite TV and IPTV channels. Mandarin-speaking Phoenix CNE TV is also available of Sky satellite TV. Other TV channels including CCTV-4, CCTV-13, CGTN Documentary,& TVB Europe are available as IPTV channels using set-top boxes. British television isn't available in China at all, as foreign televisions channels and networks are not allowed to be broadcast in China. On the other hand, there is an interest in British television shows such as Sherlock and British television formats like Britain's Got Talent (China's Got Talent, ‰∏≠ÂõΩËææ‰∫∫ÁßÄ) & Pop Idol (Super Girl, Ë∂ÖÁ∫ßÂ•≥Â£∞).

An open-air single-level bus terminal, it is directly connected to the adjacent Jurong East MRT station. History Eastern end of the original Jurong East Bus Interchange Buses parking at the end-on berths of the original Jurong East Bus Interchange The original facility used for the bus interchange was built on 30 June 1985, west of the present MRT station and opposite the Jurong CPF building at Jurong Gateway Road. Most of the bus services in the bus interchange originated from the Teban Gardens Terminal and some from the former Jurong Bus Interchange, which were re-routed to this interchange when it opened. For years, despite being in the zone marked as Jurong Regional Centre, the bus interchange had a rather low level of passenger flow as compared to the larger Boon Lay Bus Interchange serving Jurong West New Town, the Jurong Industrial Estate, as well as institutions in the west including the Nanyang Technological University. The interchange serves mainly commuters travelling to the various housing estates, schools, religious places, tourist attractions and industrial places in Jurong East and those travelling to Malaysia via Tuas Checkpoint. Following the redevelopments in Jurong, the original facility had been slated to be rebuilt into an air- conditioned facility as part of a commercial development on the site, which the commercial development and surrounding commercial places, together with the MRT station, will be collectively known as the Jurong East Integrated Transport Hub, similar to the rest of earlier hubs built. The rebuilding plan came along with the other plots of land surrounding the original facility being sold off to developers for commercial developments on 27 October 2010 when the Land Transport Authority released a tender for a \\"Proposed Jurong East Temporary Bus Interchange\\" indicating the redevelopment of the bus interchange. The land (MK05-08622X) occupied by the original facility was to be acquired by Singapore Land Authority for development into a commercial centre 10 years later and the original interchange to relocate to a temporary facility. The construction of the temporary facility spanned from middle of 2011 to the end of 2011. The temporary facility is located at the south of the MRT station along Jurong Gateway Road, roughly 0.2 km South-East from the original facility, opposite JCube at the western end of it and the JTC Corporation headquarters at the eastern end. It has the same colour scheme of red as the original facility and it somewhat resembles the temporary facility used by Boon Lay Temporary Bus Interchange. The temporary bus interchange will soon be relocated to a second temporary bus interchange at the western end near JCube and Jurong Town Hall Road in 2020. The existing temporary bus interchange will be demolished to make way for an integrated transport hub with Jurong Region line's Jurong East station. The new bus interchange brought about changes in routes. The bus stop outside Block 131 is now being reused after the Jurong East Modification Project. All former end-on bus services (except for Service 98 and 98M) now call at the bus stop outside Jurong Seventh-Day Adventist Church. Bus Contracting Model Under the new bus contracting model, all Singaporean run bus routes were split into 7 route packages - 52 under Bishan-Toa Payoh, 506 under Bedok, 51 under Sengkang- Hougang, 105 under Serangoon-Eunos, 160/160M under Bukit Merah, 197 under Clementi and the rest are under Bulim Bus Packages. In May 2015, the Land Transport Authority announced Tower Transit the successful tenderer of the Bulim Bus Package. This package comprises 15 services originating from Jurong East Bus Interchange, including the newly-introduced services 41, 143M and the amended service 49. Tower Transit took over operations of these services out of Bulim Bus Depot, and also operates in Clementi Bus Interchange, along with operating and maintaining Bukit Batok Bus Interchange. There is no change to the operator of cross-border services CW3 and CW4, which continue to be operated by Causeway Link of Malaysia.

He was capped 51 times for Northern Ireland and played at the 1982 FIFA World Cup. Club career =Arsenal= Nelson was born in Belfast where he attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, a rugby-playing school. He joined Arsenal as a 16-year-old, and turned professional on his 17th birthday in 1966. Originally a left-winger, he was later moved back into defence to become a left back. Nelson played in the 1966 FA Youth Cup final in which Arsenal beat Sunderland 5‚Äì3 over two legs. He was a regular in Arsenal's reserve side for several seasons, before making his first-team debut against Ipswich Town on 25 October 1969. He was understudy to the Gunners' established left back, Bob McNab, and only when McNab was injured in the 1971‚Äì72 season did Nelson become a regular. Even then, whenever McNab returned to fitness, Nelson was forced to step down. He made two appearances in Arsenal's successful 1969‚Äì70 Fairs Cup campaign but played no part in the final itself, and his four league matches during the 1970‚Äì71 Double-winning season were not sufficient for a medal. Select season required. McNab left Arsenal in the summer of 1975, and Nelson finally became Arsenal's first-choice left back. An aggressive, hard- tackling player, he was a crowd favourite and known for his cheeky sense of humour. For the next five seasons he was a near ever-present in the Arsenal side, and he played in all three of their successive FA Cup finals, in the starting eleven in 1978 and 1979 and as a substitute in 1980. The only win was in 1979, in which Arsenal beat Manchester United by a 3‚Äì2 scoreline. Nelson also played in the 1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, which Arsenal lost to Valencia on penalties. With the arrival of England international Kenny Sansom at the club in 1980, Nelson again found himself out of the first team. He left Arsenal in 1981 to join Brighton & Hove Albion. He played 339 first-class matches for the Gunners in total, and scored 12 goals. =Brighton & Hove Albion= Nelson made 45 appearances in all competitions in his two seasons with Brighton. In the second, 1982‚Äì83, they were relegated from the First Division but reached the 1983 FA Cup Final, losing to Manchester United 4‚Äì0 in a replay after the original match finished 2‚Äì2; Nelson was not selected for either match. He retired as a player that summer. International career Nelson made his debut for Northern Ireland as a substitute against England on 21 April 1970. He went on to win 51 international caps, two of which came in Northern Ireland's matches at the 1982 World Cup. Later career and personal life After spending a season as a coach at Brighton & Hove Albion, Nelson left the game completely and went into the insurance industry. He has also led the \\"Legends Tour\\" at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. Nelson is married with three children. His daughter Emily is married to English cricketer Matt Prior.

With a capacity of about 18,000, the ground is the main home of Derry's hurling and Gaelic football teams. Home football games are also sometimes held in Owenbeg, Dungiven. Hurling games on occasion take place at Lavey or Fr. McNally Park, Banagher. As well as staging inter-county matches, it is often used for hosting Derry football and hurling games at club level. The Derry Senior Football Championship final has in recent years usually been held at the ground. The ground also hosts the Derry Intermediate Football Championship final plus the Derry Junior Football Championship final. History It was previously used for association football as the home of Derry Celtic F.C. in the Irish League from 1900‚Äì1913. Derry Celtic were the forerunner to Derry City, who had the opportunity to purchase the ground in 1933, but hesitated on a decision and the Derry County Board bought it ten years later. The venue has been hosting Derry inter-county games since the 1930s. Over the years Dean McGilnchey Park in Ballinascreen hosted most Derry football games, but since the 1990s Celtic Park has established itself as the county's primary stadium. Recent redevelopments Floodlights were officially unveiled at the venue in February 2008 Floodlights were erected over the end of 2007 / start of 2008 and were first used for the National League game between Derry and Mayo on 2 February 2008. The official unveiling of the lights was held a few weeks later during the National League tie against Tyrone on 5 April. In the last couple of years, despite being able to hold more, the capacity had been limited to 13,000 for safety reasons. However, this wasn't set to change with the venue currently undergoing a ¬£1.8 million revamp. Work on a new all-seater stand on the Lone Moor Road side of the ground started a few days after the 2008 Derry Championship final. It was to hold 3,600 people, bringing the total stadium capacity to 18,000 or nearly 20,000. Other new developments in the revamped stand include a control room, TV gantry, media room, stewards' room, extra exit gates, improved disabled access and improved toilet facilities. The developments will make the stadium \\"among the best in Ulster\\". The developments wouldn't be completed until the start of the Summer (2009), therefore Derry's home 2009 National League games had to be played elsewhere, most likely Glen or Ballinascreen. The renovations were completed in time for Derry's Ulster Senior Football Championship game with Monaghan (24 May).

Located in the Valley of Peshawar, on the western fringe of Peshawar city, Jamrud is the doorway to the Khyber Pass which is just to the west of the town. The pass connects Jamrud with Landi Kotal to the west, located near the border of Afghanistan's Nangarhar Province. Jamrud has remained a location on the trade route between Central Asia and South Asia, and a strategic military location. It is located at an altitude of above sea level. The Jamrud Fort is located west of the city of Peshawar. History The Battle of Jamrud between the Sikh Empire and Durrani Empire took place at Jamrud where the Sikh general Hari Singh Nalwa was killed and Sikh expansion halted. The famous Jamrud Fort was also built in 54 days by Hari Singh Nalwa. The proposal to build the fort was issued to him by one of his generals. The proposal was opposed; however he finally decided to build the fort and construct it's layout. the foundation of the fort that has survived was laid by General Hari Singh Nalwa on 18 December 1836 and the construction was completed in 54 days. The fort was finished on 10th February 1837. Hari Singh Nalwa's grave is still engrained next to the fort where his cremated ashes remain. Jamrud was a strategic location and served as a base for a cantonment of the British Indian Army during the period of the British Raj. It was mainly used by the British army as a base of operations for their wars in Afghanistan. During the military operations of 1878-79 Jamrud became a place of considerable importance as the frontier outpost on British territory towards Afghanistan, and it was also the base of operations for a portion of the Tirah campaign in 1897-1898. It was also the headquarters of the Khyber Rifles, and the collecting station for the Khyber tolls. The place is currently now the headquarters of the Frontier Corps, a branch of the Pakistan Army. The population in 1901 was 1,848. In 2017, the population was recorded to be 63,843 and the place continues to be of strategic significance.

Early life Evans was born in London of Welsh descent. She studied at the Royal College of Music with among others Margaret Cable, and the Geneva Conservatoire. She was accepted into the conservatoire without actually having had any formal training as a singer. For her audition she surprisingly did Carmen. She started out as a mezzo at the Royal College, but one of her teachers immediately recognised her soprano potential. Career Evans made her debut as Countess Ceprano in Rigoletto 1967 in Geneva and went on to make her debut in a leading role in 1968 as Fiordiligi in Cos√¨ fan tutte at the then Sadler's Wells, later English National Opera in 1968 to critical acclaim. In the early years of her career, she sang many of the leading Puccini and Mozart soprano roles, like Tosca and Countess Almaviva in Le Nozze di Figaro. In the late sixties she started to work with the lighter Wagner roles, like Elsa in Lohengrin and Senta in The Flying Dutchman, roles that became her trade mark. However, it was the role of Br√ºnnhilde that would earn her international fame, most notably in the Wagner temple of Bayreuth in 1989-1992, a performance which was also captured on CD and video (now transferred to DVD, and announced on Blu-ray by the end of 2012), conducted by Daniel Barenboim and directed by Harry Kupfer. In this performance she sang with example Siegfried Jerusalem and John Tomlinson. She also earned an Olivier Award for this production. She also played Isolde in Tristan und Isolde, a role often considered to be her finest achievement. Retirement In 2003, she retired from performing to dedicate herself to giving Master Classes and to coach other British singers in Wagnerian performance techniques. Her last public performance was in 2005 in a comeback performance in Cardiff doing excerpts from her celebrated Isolde and other Wagner performances.

Slave quarters. Isaac Royall, Jr. with his wife and child at his side, and other relations, by Robert Feke, 1741 The Isaac Royall House is a historic house located in Medford, Massachusetts, close to what is now known as Tufts University as well as \\"One house, two histories in Medford.\\" The historic estate was founded by Baystate native Isaac Royall and is recognized as giving a face and life to the history and existence of slave quarters and slavery in Massachusetts. It is a National Historic Landmark, operated as a non-profit museum, and open for public visits between June 1 and the last weekend in October. The Royall House is notable for its excellent preservation, its possession of the only surviving slave quarters in Massachusetts, and its American Revolution associations with General John Stark, Molly Stark, and General George Washington. Among the historic objects on display is a tea box, said to be from the same batch that was dumped into Boston Harbor on the night of December 16, 1773, and a very small painting by John Singleton Copley of Isaac Royall, Jr. The Royalls were the largest slave holding family and Massachusetts history. Origins Governor John Winthrop built a house on the site about 1637. Around 1692, that house was replaced with a more imposing brick structure standing 2¬Ω stories high and one room in depth, with exceedingly thick walls. On December 26, 1732, Isaac Royall, Sr., a slave trader, rum distiller, and wealthy merchant of Antigua, purchased the house and 504 acres (2 km¬≤) of land along the west bank of the Mystic River in what was then Charlestown, an area annexed to Medford in 1754. He remodeled the house extensively between 1733 and 1737, adding a third story, encasing the east facade in clapboard, and ornamenting the exterior with architectural details and continuous strips of spandrel panels. Royall also constructed outbuildings in 1732, including the only known slave quarters that survive in New England. After this construction, Royall brought 27 enslaved Africans from Antigua, which doubled the enslaved population of the community. Early history Isaac Royall, Jr. (1719‚Äì1781) came into its possession of the property in 1739 following the death of his father. He greatly enlarged it between 1747 and 1750. He more than doubled the depth of the main building, greatly extended the brick end walls correspondingly, and at either end of the house constructed great twin chimneys connected by parapets. Other features he added include the false ashlar siding on the new western facade and great Doric pilasters inserted at the corners. The interior was redone in Georgian wooden paneling, trim, and archways of a quality possibly unsurpassed by any surviving house of the period. Several of the major rooms that survive are original. He expanded a colonial farmhouse into a three story Georgian mansion considered one of the grandest houses of its era in North America. The construction process was largely borrowed from Caribbean construction practices. A painting of Mary and Elizabeth Royall, the teenage daughters of Isaac Royall, Jr., executed by John Singleton Copley about 1758, is in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. A reproduction hangs in the Royall House. Copley also painted their father's portrait about 1769. An earlier family portrait from 1740 is in the Special Collections Department, Harvard Law School Library. During the American Revolution, the Royall family were British Loyalists, and as the British soldiers marched to the Battle of Lexington and Concord in 1775, the Royalls left Medford and boarded a ship in Boston. They sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia and then to England. Isaac Royall never returned to Medford. After the Royalls' flight, the Massachusetts General Court confiscated the estate. General John Stark made the Royall House his headquarters before the evacuation of Boston by the British on March 17, 1776. The mansion was used during the early months of the Revolution by Generals Lee, Stark, and Sullivan. George Washington, according to legend, interrogated two British soldiers in the house's Marble Chamber. Molly Stark is said to have watched the movements of the British troops in their camp by the river from a lookout on the roof. In 1806, the estate was returned to Isaac Royall's heirs, who sold it. In accordance with Isaac Royall's will, a portion of his estate was donated to Harvard University and used to found Harvard Law School.  Slave Quarters  The Slave Quarters were located in Medford 35 feet from the Royall House. There were more than 60 enslaved Africans who resided there over the 40 years. When Sir Issac Royall Sr. expanded the house in the 1730s, he adopted a practice from the Caribbean and build an \\"out kitchen,\\" which was a detached kitchen meant to keep the heat away from the main house in the summer. In the 1760s, they added an clapboard extension which expanded the house and formed the original slave quarters. The Slave Quarters had working and sleeping quarters, along with a summer kitchen.Today, you can take a tour of the Royall House finding a \\"kitchen chamber\\" where slaves worked and slept in a room on the second floor. Preservation In 1898, the Sarah Bradlee Fulton Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution conceived the idea of preserving the Royall House \\"for the sake of its history and aesthetic value.\\" It was restored by Joseph Everett Chandler. On Patriots' Day in 1898, they opened the house to the public for a Loan Exhibition of colonial furnishings and valuable relics. In 1907, this group of women recruited a wider group of \\"patriotic men and women\\" and formed the Royall House Association. The group's initial mission was to raise US$10,000 to purchase the house, the slave quarters and three-quarters of an acre of surrounding land to be maintained as a museum, which they accomplished by April 1908. Over the years, the Royall House has undergone a number of interior and exterior restorations to its buildings and site. In 1960, the Royall House was designated a National Historic Landmark.

He was an important caudillo, military general and regional leader, who effectively controlled the Mexican state of Tamaulipas as governor.Laurens Ballard Perry, Ju√°rez and D√≠az: Machine Politics in Mexico. DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press 1978, p. 5. In borderlands history he is known for leading a paramilitary mounted Mexican Militia in the failed Cortina Wars. The \\"Wars\\" were raids targeting Anglo-American civilians whose settlement Cortina opposed near the several leagues of land granted to his wealthy family on both sides of the Rio Grande. Anglo families began immigrating to the Lower Rio Grande Valley after the Mexican Army was defeated by the Anglo-Mexican rebels of the Mexican State of Tejas, in the Texas Revolution. From 1836 to 1848 when Cortina was 12‚Äì24 years old, parts of the Cortina Grant North of the Rio Grande River was in the disputed territory between the Rio Grande and the Nueces Rivers, claimed by both Mexico and the Republic of Texas. The situation had a big impact on Cortina and his perspective on government and power. When the United States defeated Mexico in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1848, Mexico was forced to cede the disputed territory to Texas. Cortina opposed this concession. However, Cortina's Mexican militia was easily defeated and forced to flee into Mexico when the Texas Rangers, the United States Army and the local militia of Brownsville, Texas and Matamoros, Tamaulipas all organized and fought against his forces. According to Robert Elman, author of Badmen of the West, Cortina was the first \\"socially motivated border bandit,\\" similar to Catarino Garza and Pancho Villa of later generations. His followers were known as the \\"Cortinistas.\\" Early life and political rising A young Juan Cortina wearing the Mexican Army uniform. Juan Cortina was born in Camargo, Tamaulipas, the son of Trinidad Cortina and Est√©fana Goseacochea, a wealthy cattle-ranching family. At the time of his birth, his family's Espiritu Santo land grant encompassed more than 260,000 acres. When he was three, his family relocated to the Rio Grande Valley, as his mother had inherited vast tracts of Espiritu Santo in the area surrounding Matamoros and Brownsville. In 1846, at age 22, he enlisted with a Mexican Army unit commanded Gen. Mariano Arista, who had arrived at Matamoros in an attempt to stop the advancing forces of Gen. Zachary Taylor. Arista asked Cortina to form a force from the local vaqueros (Mexican cowboys) who worked for him and the nearby ranches. This irregular cavalry regiment (called the \\"Tamaulipas\\") was placed under his command, and as the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War began, it participated with the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. With the end of the war and the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo on February 2, 1848, the Cortina family estates were divided by the new frontier, leaving a vast portion of their lands inside United States territory. Cortina became an important political boss for the South Texas Democratic Party, and although the new local authorities invalidated many of his land claims, he remained a large rancher. Many landowners of Mexican ancestry suffered from this situation as well, and eventually Cortina came into conflict with an influential group of lawyers and judges of Brownsville, whom he accused of expropriating land from Mexican Texans or \\"Tejanos\\", who were unfamiliar with the American legal system. \\"Flocks of vampires, in the guise of men,\\" he wrote, robbed Mexicans \\"of their property, incarcerated, chased, murdered, and hunted them like wild beasts\\". Cortina's own skirmishes with the law steadily intensified, and he was indicted twice on charges of cattle theft. However, he was not arrested due to his already considerable popularity among the poorer Tejanos, who considered this attempt to be nothing but another demonstration of legal harassment by the \\"Anglos\\" (the Texans of American origin) to their class. With the self-appointed purpose of defending the rights of this social group, Cortina gathered, trained and armed a private army, and on many occasions he used this force to resist the eviction of Tejanos from their lands. As a result, he became a popular leader among the poorer local population, many of whom considered him a hero against the abuse of power by the Anglos. In 1858, Cortina along with other rancheros attacked what was speculated to be the final surviving members of the Karankawa Indians, a Native American people whose homeland comprised the coastline of southern Texas, \\"when they were surprised at their hiding place in Texas, and were exterminated.\\" The Cortina Troubles =First Cortina War= The tension between Cortina and the Brownsville authorities broke into violence on 13 July 1859. Brownsville town marshal Robert Shears was brutalizing Cortina's 60-year-old former ranch hand. Cortina happened to pass by, and asked Shears to let him handle the situation; Shears is said to have yelled at him in reply, \\"What is it to you, you damned Mexican?\\" Cortina fired a warning shot, then when Shears did not stop, he intervened and shot him in the shoulder. Cortina pulled the man up to his horse and quickly left the scene. On the 28 September he raided and occupied the town with a coterie of seventy men. Cortina's enemies had fled in the meantime, and during the occupation of Brownsville, he issued a famous proclamation to reveal his intentions to both communities. \\"(...) There is no need of fear. Orderly people and honest citizens are inviolable to us in their persons and interests. Our object, as you have seen, has been to chastise the villainy of our enemies, which heretofore has gone unpunished. These have connived with each other, and form, so to speak, a perfidious inquisitorial lodge to persecute and rob us, without any cause, and for no other crime on our part than that of being of Mexican origin, considering us, doubtless, destitute of those gifts which they themselves do not possess. (...) Mexicans! Peace be with you! Good inhabitants of the State of Texas, look on them as brothers, and keep in mind that which the Holy Spirit saith: \\"Thou shalt not be the friend of the passionate man; nor join thyself to the madman, lest thou learn his mode of work and scandalize thy soul.\\" (Proverbs 22:24-25) Cortina retained control over Brownsville until 30 September 1859, when he evacuated the town at the urging of influential residents of Matamoros. The following days, the townsfolk of Brownsville formed a twenty-man group in order to fight Cortina, called \\"the Brownsville Tigers\\". In November, the Brownsville Tigers learned that Cortina was at his mother's ranch in the nearby town of Santa Rita, five miles west of Brownsville. They immediately launched an attack, only to be sent into retreat in disarray by Cortina's forces. Later the same month, the Brownsville Tigers were joined by a group of Texas Rangers, and Cortina decided to attack them. The offensive was unsuccessful, and on December, a second group of Rangers led by Capt. John \\"Rip\\" Ford arrived, larger and better organized. Because of appeals from Brownsville citizens, the U.S. Army sent troops from San Antonio to the nearby Fort Brown, which had been abandoned a few years ago. The fort's new commander, Maj. Samuel Heintzelman, united and coordinated all armed groups to put an end to the Cortina threat. Cortina retreated up the Rio Grande, until on December 27, 1859 Heintzelman and Ford engaged him in the Battle of Rio Grande City. Cortina's forces were decisively defeated, losing sixty men and all their equipment. Pursued and defeated by Ford again a few days later, Cortina retreated into the Burgos Mountains. The First Cortina War had finished, and with increasing pressure from both the United States and Mexican Government to cease all hostile activities, Cortina remained away from the scene for more than a year. =Second Cortina War= In May 1861, the much shorter Second Cortina War took place. The American Civil War had just begun, and Cortina, who had aligned himself with the Federal Government of the United States, invaded Zapata County. He was defeated by Confederate Capt. Santos Benavides at the battle of Carrizo, and retreated into Mexico after losing eighteen men. No longer would Cortina conduct large-scale military incursions within the territory of the United States, albeit accusations of promoting guerrilla actions against the richer Texan landowners in the area were numerous throughout the following years.Juan Nepomuceno Cortina, The University of Texas Arlington Later political career In the following years, Cortina focused on his political career within the state of Tamaulipas. President Benito Ju√°rez appointed him military commander of the forces stationed at the southeastern frontier. When the French intervention in Mexico began in 1862, Cortina sided with Ju√°rez at first, and took part in the Battle of Puebla on May 5. However, as the French eventually defeated the Mexican forces led by the Gen. Ignacio Zaragoza and succeeded to establish Archduke Maximilian of Habsburg as Maximilian I, sovereign of Mexico, Cortina sensed the opportunity to consolidate his power in the Tamaulipas region and switched sides by joining the invaders. This alliance was short-lived, and soon Cortina rose against the French. Commanding a large army that he had personally gathered and equipped, he engaged the interventionist forces that had landed near Tampico and defeated them. His further military actions along Central Mexico helped in the effort against the invasion, and he was present at the execution of Maximilian in Quer√©taro (June 1867). During this time, in the absence of a legal national authority, he appointed himself Governor of Tamaulipas twice - in 1864 and in 1865. He resigned from the office in 1866 in favor of Generals Jos√© Mar√≠a Carvajal and Santiago Tapia. The attitude of the American Texans towards Cortina changed completely with the defeat of the Confederacy and his important role in the defense of the Mexican Government, and after returning to his estates in Matamoros in 1870 he was formally invited on several occasions as guest of honor of the city of Brownsville. His support to the Union motivated many notable residents of the Rio Grande Valley (including a former mayor of Brownsville) to endorse a petition to the Texas Legislature, asking for a formal pardon for his crimes during the Cortina Troubles. Although this motion didn't prosper and was eventually rejected, Cortina had earned the lasting sympathy of most of the local population of both Hispanic and American descent. The Mexican authorities also honored him: he was appointed Brigadier General, and the largest battalion of the state of Tamaulipas was renamed \\"el Batall√≥n Cortina\\" (the \\"Cortina Battalion\\"). Arrest and exile Cortina supported General Porfirio D√≠az, military hero of the French intervention in Mexico and political rival of Benito Ju√°rez and his successor Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada. Cortina attempted to raise an army from the local population and sheltered D√≠az following his failed rising. Repeated accusations against Cortina by wealthy landowners in Texas of conducting cross-border raids against their cattle and properties were eventually heeded by the Lerdo's administration, and used as public justification to detain him. In 1875, Cortina was arrested and brought to Mexico City. On 29 November 1876, D√≠az overthrew President Lerdo in the Plan of Tuxtepec, which saw his re- election as a violation of the Constitution of 1857. Cortina was allowed to return to Tamaulipas, where he once again tried to raise an armed force. But before he could put this new army to any use, D√≠az ordered his arrest and confinement within Mexico City for the second time. Many factors contributed to D√≠az decision, the main ones being Cortina's ambition to power within Tamaulipas above anything, and the consequent unreliability and instability of his support, as he had already demonstrated many times in his life. D√≠az had also received a large sum of money, estimated from anywhere between $50,000 to $200,000 from the wealthy South Texas ranchers to finance his seizure of power with the condition that, in turn, he would take care of stopping Cortina's raids on United States territory. Most important, D√≠az was determined to remain in absolute control of the Government (as he did for the subsequent thirty-three years), no matter the means involved, and he systematically removed all traces of opposition that could have challenged his will. Also, with diplomatic pressure coming from the United States Government, which was concerned about Cortina's ambitions in Cameron County and his behavior in the past, the President decreed the arrest and execution of his former ally. Gen. Jos√© Canales, a longtime enemy of Cortina who was sent to carry out the order, decided to bring him to Mexico City instead, fearing the popular reprisals from the people of Tamaulipas. His old nemesis, John S. Ford, also interceded on his behalf. He was kept at the military prison of Santiago Tlaltelolco, without being tried or sentenced. He remained there until 1890, when he was removed from prison and placed under house arrest in a comfortable home in Azcapotzalco, northwest of Mexico City. Cortina remained there until his death on October 30, 1894. In popular culture * Cortina is the subject of Oscar Ch√°vez's song, \\"Corrido de Juan Cortina\\". *Charles B.

He played the eponymous private investigator in the ITV series Boon and Harry Slater in BBC's EastEnders. He was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the 1983 film Gorky Park. In his prime, Elphick always looked older than he was, and with his gruff Cockney accent and lip-curling sneer he often played menacing hard men. Elphick struggled with a highly publicised addiction to alcohol; at the height of his problem he admitted to consuming two litres of spirits a day, which contributed to his death from a heart attack in 2002.  Early life  Elphick grew up in Chichester, Sussex, where his family had a butcher's shop. He was educated at Lancastrian Secondary Modern Boys School in Chichester, where he took part in several school productions including Noah and A Midsummer Night's Dream. He initially considered joining the Merchant Navy and helped out in his local boatyard during school holidays. It has been reported that he stumbled upon acting by chance when, at the age of 15, he took a job as an apprentice electrician at the Chichester Festival Theatre while it was being built. He gained an interest in acting whilst watching stars such as Laurence Olivier, Michael Redgrave and Sybil Thorndyke. Olivier advised Elphick to go to drama school and gave him two speeches to use at auditions. Elphick was offered a number of places but decided to train at the Central School of Speech and Drama in Swiss Cottage (aged 18), because Olivier had attended there.  Career  After graduating from drama school Elphick was offered roles primarily as menacing heavies. He made his debut in Fraulein Doktor (an Italian-made First World War film circa 1968). He went on to play the Captain in Tony Richardson's version of Hamlet (1969); landed parts in cult films such as The First Great Train Robbery and The Elephant Man and appeared in Lindsay Anderson's allegorical O Lucky Man! (1973). He was also seen as Phil Daniels's father in the cult film Quadrophenia (1979), as Pasha in Gorky Park (1983) and as the poacher, Jake, in Withnail & I (1987). In 1984 he played the lead, Fisher, a British detective recalling under hypnosis a dystopian, crumbling Europe and his hunt for a serial killer in Lars von Trier's Palme D'Or nominated debut film, The Element of Crime. On stage, Elphick played Marcellus and the Player King in Tony Richardson's stage version of Hamlet at the Roundhouse Theatre and on Broadway and he later played Claudius to Jonathan Pryce's Hamlet at the Royal Court Theatre, directed by Richard Eyre. In 1981 he appeared in the Ray Davies/Barrie Keeffe musical Chorus Girls at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East and he was also seen in The Changing Room, directed by Lindsay Anderson, at the Royal Court Theatre. His last West End stage appearance was in 1997 as Doolittle in Pygmalion directed by Ray Cooney at the Albery Theatre. However, it was for his television roles that Elphick became best known. He briefly appeared in Coronation Street (1974) as Douglas Wormold, son of the landlord Edward, who for many years owned most of the properties in the road. Douglas unsuccessfully tried to buy the newsagent shop The Kabin from Len Fairclough. He played three characters in the popular Granada Television series Crown Court‚Äîin 1973 as a defendant, in 1975 as a witness (Frank Hollins, private secretary to a female soprano in the episode Songbirds out of Tune), and from 1975 to 1983 as the barrister Neville Griffiths Q.C.. He played one of the main roles in the film Black Island in 1978 for the Children's Film Foundation, played a villain in The Sweeney episode \\"One of Your Own\\" (1978) and played a policeman in The Professionals episode \\"Backtrack\\" (1979) and had a minor role in Hazell (1979), and appeared in the Dennis Potter play Blue Remembered Hills (1979). Elphick took the title role in Jack Pulman's drama Private Schulz (1981). Here he played Gerhard Schulz, a German soldier conscripted into SS Counter Espionage during the Second World War to destroy the British economy by flooding it with forged money. He appeared as the Irish labourer Magowan during the first series of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet (1983) and starred as Sidney Mundy in the ITV sitcom Pull the Other One (1984), before playing Sam Tyler in four series of Three Up, Two Down (1985‚Äì89). In 1986 Elphick landed his biggest television success, Boon (1986‚Äì92, 1995). He played Ken Boon, a retired fireman who opened a motorbike despatch business and later became a private investigator. Boon was very successful and ran for seven series, attracting audiences of 11 million at its peak. There was also a one- off episode screened in 1995, two years after it had been made. During breaks from Boon, Elphick continued to act in film with cameo roles in The Krays (1990) and Let Him Have It (1991), and in 1991 he played Des King in Buddy's Song, starring Chesney Hawkes and Roger Daltrey. In 1993 Elphick took the role of a former Fleet Street journalist running a Darlington news agency in Harry (1993, 1995). He played the alcoholic and ruthless Harry Salter, who frequently used exploitation and underhand tactics to get a story. This series however was less successful and it was soon cancelled. Elphick went on to play Billy Bones in Ken Russell's televised version of Treasure Island (1995) and Barkis in David Copperfield (1999). In 2001 he joined the cast of EastEnders, where he played Harry Slater, a romantic interest for Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). The plotline indicated that Slater had sexually abused his niece, Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), at the age of 13 and her \\"sister\\" Zoe (Michelle Ryan) was the daughter born to her when she became pregnant by him. Elphick's heavy drinking began to affect his performances, so the character promptly left the series and was killed off off-screen.  Personal life  Elphick met his long-term partner, schoolteacher Julia Alexander, in 1963 and remained with her until her death from cancer in 1996. The couple had a daughter, Kate. For many years Elphick struggled with alcoholism. He made the first of many attempts to stop drinking in 1988. He sought help from Alcoholics Anonymous in the early 1990s, although he admitted he was still drinking in 1993. In 1996, he admitted that he had begun drinking heavily again and also contemplated suicide after the death of his partner of 33 years. However he rallied and returned to the stage in Loot. The actor also confessed to having taken cocaine and once, while high on drugs, grabbing a shotgun and chasing a gang of thugs after he had been carjacked near his villa in Portugal. Elphick was admitted to the Priory Clinic in Roehampton, in an attempt to beat his addictions. Reports of his alcohol abuse persisted, however, and during his brief spell on EastEnders during 2001, it was reported that the BBC was considering dropping his character if his drinking was not curtailed.  Death  On 7 September 2002, Elphick died of a heart attack complicated by his drinking problem. He had collapsed at his home in Willesden Green, London, after complaining of pains. He was rushed to hospital where he died. He was 55 years old, twelve days before his 56th birthday. The funeral was held at Chichester Crematorium.

It was built in the 1820s by convict labour in the Moreton Bay penal settlement and is the oldest surviving building in Queensland. It is also known as Brisbane Observatory and Windmill Tower. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. Today it is the centrepiece of Observatory Park.  History  The oldest convict-built structure surviving in Queensland, the windmill tower has accommodated a range of uses. Constructed in 1828 to process the wheat and corn crops of the Moreton Bay penal settlement, it had a treadmill attached for times when there was no wind but also as a tool for punishing convicts. The mill ceased grinding grain in 1845 and the treadmill was removed sometime before 1849. From 1855 the tower was reused as a signal station to communicate shipping news between the entrance of the Brisbane River and the town. Substantial renovations were made to it in 1861 including the installation of a time ball to assist in regulating clocks and watches. Twenty years later a cottage for the signalman was constructed to the immediate west of the tower, with a detached kitchen erected to the south two years after that. Both were later demolished. The windmill tower was used as a facility for early radio, telephony and television communications research from the 1920s and underwent substantial conservation work in the 1980s and 2009. = Grain grinding = In May 1825, after eight months of occupation at Redcliffe, the contingent of convicts, soldiers, administrators and their families comprising the Moreton Bay penal settlement relocated to the site of present-day Brisbane's central business district. The growing settlement was to be self-sufficient in feeding its residents by cultivating corn (also known as maize) and wheat crops at the government farm, which were then processed into meal and flour by hand mills.Heritage Unit, p. 9 & 11. By 1827, with a substantial crop to process, the settlement storekeeper recommended a treadmill be erected to grind the crop into flour. Commandant Patrick Logan indicated at this time that such a device at Brisbane town would be of service and also provide an avenue for the punishment of convicts. There is little evidence confirming details of the windmill tower's planning and construction. In July 1828, Peter Beauclerk Spicer, the Superintendent of Convicts at the time, recorded in his diary that convicts were \\"clearing ground for foundations for the Mill\\" and proceeded to dig a circular trench that reached bedrock and had a circumference of approximately . Allan Cunningham noted soon after that construction was in progress. The mill was constructed on the highest point overlooking the settlement on what is now Wickham Terrace. By 31 October 1828 the first grain was being ground at the site by a mill gang; however it is supposed that this was done by a treadmill as the rotating cap and sails associated with the wind-powered operation of the mill were not brought to the site until November. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the wind-powered grinding of grain did not begin until December. There were two pairs of millstones inside the tower, each driven independently by the treadmill and sail mechanisms. The former was located outside the tower, a shaft connecting the treadwheel and the mill cogwheels inside. Two sketches from the early 1830s show the windmill tower and its sail stocks in place, while an 1839 description depicts a tower built from stone and brick, comprising four floors, a treadmill and windmill. From 1829 the windmill tower was said to be continually requiring repair, possibly because its equipment was all made from locally available timber rather than iron. The treadmill was an important component of the mill, for use as punishment without trial, and for times when there was no wind but the amounts of grain sufficient to sustain the settlement still required processing. No plans exist of the Brisbane treadmill; however, the Office of the Colonial Architect produced a standard Design for Tread Mill Adapted for Country Districts Average Estimate ¬£120. Between 25 and 30 men worked at the mill at any one time. Sixteen operated the treadmill, although as there are no plans, it is uncertain whether it comprised a standard 16-place treadmill, or two 8-place sections connected to a common shaft. Each man would climb five steps to get onto the wheel, standing on the treads and holding on to the rail. The men would then work as though ascending steps to operate the treadmill. Some undertook this task while in leg irons, while the more able used one hand to hold on and the other to draw sketches of people, animals and scenes on the boards of the mill. The men would work from sunrise to sunset with three hours rest in the middle of the day in summer, and two hours in winter. The first casualty of the treadmill, which produced the first official record of its existence, occurred in September 1829 when prisoner Michael Collins lost his life after being entangled in the operating mechanism. Maps of 1840s Brisbane feature a rectangular structure attached to the outside of the tower, Robert Dixon's in particular showing a structure, probably the treadmill, located on ground that was to become Wickham Terrace. In February 1836 the windmill tower was struck by lightning, causing severe damage throughout, including to the treadmill. A convict millwright was brought from Sydney in June for the repairs, which amounted to a major rebuild of the structure that was not completed until May 1837. In April 1839, with the closure of the Moreton Bay penal settlement being planned, the windmill tower was one of the buildings recommended for transfer to the colony. This was approved in 1840-41 but it continued to sporadically process grain until 1845, when due to crop failure, a stagnant population and the availability of imported flour, it finally ceased being used. The penal settlement had officially closed in February 1842. The treadmill operated until 1845 and had been removed by October 1849. The windmill tower in Brisbane is the oldest of its type left standing in Australia and further distinguished by having been built by convict labour. The earliest standing stone windmill towers extant around the country date from the 1830s and include: one built in 1837 in South Perth, Western Australia; another built in the same year at Oatlands in Tasmania which operated until 1890; and another built at Mount Gilead near Campbelltown in New South Wales in 1836. Most were built to process grains into flour. Other surviving mill towers are the one built in 1842 by FR Nixon at Mount Barker in South Australia; Chapman's mill built around 1850 at Wonnerup in Western Australia, and another built at a similar time on an island in the Murray River near South Yunderup in Western Australia. None of the nineteen windmill towers that characterised the early settlement at Sydney have survived. Technological developments, most particularly steam power which was more dependable than wind power or that generated by convict labour at a treadmill, rendered wind-driven mills largely redundant. = Surveying = Indicative of the prominence of its physical position, the tower served as one of the stations for the trigonometrical survey of the Moreton Bay district conducted by Robert Dixon, Granville Stapylton and James Warner from May 1839 in preparation for the area being opened to free settlement. Land leases in the wider Brisbane area were issued under s.28 of the Regulations of 29 March 1848 and were nominally one mile square sections within a grid defined by (magnetic) north/south/east-west section lines. The grid had its origin at the convict-built windmill in Brisbane.Shaw, Barry, 1947‚Äì; Brisbane History Group (2010), Brisbane : people and places of Ashgrove (1st ed.), Brisbane History Group, p29 = Executions = In July 1841 the Brisbane tower was reputedly the site of a public execution of two Aboriginal men who had been convicted in Sydney of the murder of Assistant Surveyor Granville Stapylton and one of his party near Mount Lindsay on 31 May 1840. The Aboriginal men were returned to Moreton Bay and hanged with about 100 Aboriginal people present; however it may be that the execution took place elsewhere on what was known as Windmill Hill. = Landmark = After the cessation of milling operations there were discussions about possible future use of Brisbane's windmill tower. In December 1849 the tower was put up for auction and bought by a government official who promptly sought tenders for removal of it and its machinery (the auction terms required it to be cleared away by three months after the sale). Ownership of the place quickly reverted to the Crown because of a legal problem with the sale, but not before some dismantling had occurred. In a January 1850 article the Moreton Bay Courier continued its appeal for the windmill not to be pulled down and secured by the town, arguing that aside from its landmark and picturesque qualities it was the \\"best fixed point for land measurement in the district\\". In this vein the site was the most accessible viewing point for the picturesque landscape of Brisbane and its environs. Despite earlier calls to erase evidence of Brisbane's convict past, \\"sentiment and pragmatism combined to override the detrimental taint of convictism\\" saving the tower from destruction. The sails were still in place in 1854 and appear in a painting of the windmill completed in 1855. = Signal station and observatory = By 1855 Brisbane was the leading Queensland port and it became important to establish signal stations to communicate shipping news between the entrance of the Brisbane River and the town, one of which was set up on Windmill Hill. This required modifications to the tower to include a semaphore station connected to the electric telegraph. Information on ships entering the river was converted to semaphore signals using flags hoisted on a mast erected on top of the tower. The renovations were undertaken by John Petrie in October 1861 to plans by colonial architect Charles Tiffin and included the removal of the windmill stocks or arms and wheels; the laying of floors on each storey; new doors and windows; a weatherproof floor on the top of the tower with an iron railing; a new winding staircase from bottom to top; repair of stone, brickwork and plastering; and the installation of a high flagstaff to fly signals. The tower's renovation at this time also fitted it out as a public observatory and it became known by that term. A cottage for the signalman was constructed in 1883 to the immediate west of the tower to plans prepared by Government Architect FDG Stanley and on part of the Waterworks reserve. Two years later a detached kitchen was also constructed behind it to the south of the tower. Use of the signal station was discontinued in 1921 by the state government, which then sought a new use for the structure and land. Despite this the flagstaff remained in place until 1949. From January 1893 the Fire Brigade implemented a nightly observation post from a specially constructed platform on top of the tower. This was used until around 1922. = Museum = On 20 January 1862, the Old Windmill became the first home of the newly founded Queensland Museum; serving this purpose until 1868 when other accommodation was provided in the old convict barracks or parliamentary building on Queen Street. = Time keeping = Petrie also installed a time ball on the tower to provide a reliable authority for regulating clocks and watches. It was dropped at one o'clock each day based on observations relayed by telegraph from Sydney. The time ball was replaced by a time gun in 1866, with an embankment and shed constructed to hold the gun in 1874. After 1882 the gun and shed were moved to the eastern section of the current reserve before the shed was demolished in 1908. The time gun proved useful to people as far away as Logan, Caboolture and Ipswich. The old gun was replaced in 1888 with another before a new electrically controlled time ball was installed in 1894. This was associated with the legislated implementation of a single time throughout the colony, being designated as ten hours earlier than the mean time at Greenwich. Adjustments were made to the tower at this time to accommodate the new time ball. The roof was lowered and the flagstaff pared down. After Federation, the Australian Government assumed responsibility for the site in 1901 but control reverted to the Queensland Government in 1908 when it was designated as an Observatory Reserve. In 1902 it had been connected to the Railway Telegraph Office at Roma Street so that the railways had the correct time for their operations. The evidence of historical photographs suggests that sometime between 1902 and 1912 the cabin at the top was increased in size. The time ball remained in operation until 1930. Towards the end of the 19th century, the tower was encased in a cement render to protect the brick and masonry from rainwater damage. The current render dates from a 1988 refurbishment, and is scored to imitate the stone blocks it covers. The site was placed under the trusteeship of the Brisbane City Council in 1922. The site of the cottage remained in the hands of the Waterworks Board and a boundary re-arrangement had to occur to allow its continued use in relation to the observatory. = Radio and telephony research = At this time the Queensland Institute of Radio Engineers began wireless radio and telephony research at the tower, and used the signalman's cottage to meet two nights a month. Apparatus to operate a wireless radio station was installed in 1926. The cottage was occupied on a more regular basis in order to reduce the risk of vandalism to the tower, but fell vacant. In 1926 the City Architect, AH Foster, proposed a plan for beautifying the observatory, which included removal of the cottage and adjacent sheds. The tender of Messrs Guyomar and Wright to remove the cottage, shed and outhouse for ¬£60 was accepted. At this time the stone and wrought iron wall along Wickham Terrace was erected. It was intended to add \\"dignity to the historical reserve, and harmonise with the massive character of the Tower\\". From 1922 to 1926 the tower served the Institute of Radio Engineers for meetings and experiments, Gympie Radio Pioneer A. E. Dillon 4CH, was the first experimenter to conduct Medium Wave tests and transmissions from this tower in late 1921 or early 1922. The Tower was ideally suited for this purpose as it commanded a panoramic view from Moreton Bay in the east, to Darling Downs on the western horizon. Nearby he erected a mast and strung an antenna between it and the Tower - the most impressive configuration of its kind in Queensland at the time. From 1924 Thomas Elliott installed equipment in the tower to undertake cutting-edge television research; he and Allen Campbell giving a demonstration from the site in 1934 which constituted Queensland's first television broadcast. It was considered by many at the time as the most outstanding achievement thus far in the history of television in Australia. They gained a licence from the government and continued experimental broadcasting from the tower until about 1944. During the 1930s and 1940s the tower was the venue for pioneer television broadcasting.Campbell Newman, \\"bmag\\", 3 November 2009 = Tourist attraction = From 1945 the Brisbane City Council was considering suitable action to preserve the tower, which had become a popular visitor attraction. Some restoration work was carried out in 1950 on the advice of Frank Costello (then Officer in Charge of Planning and Building with the City Council), which included removal of old render and re-rendering the entire structure. It was at this time that the flagstaff was removed in preparation for making the open ground of the reserve \\"a real park\\". Certainly these conservation efforts considered the heritage value of the place as well as the public's use of it. However, by 1962 the windmill tower was again in poor condition. Floodlighting to enhance its appearance for tourists was undertaken for the first time during the Warana Festival five years later. In the early 1970s the Council and the National Trust of Queensland undertook detailed investigations regarding restoration and transfer of trusteeship from the council to the trust (the latter were abandoned in 1976). None of the original plans or any of the original windmill machinery parts could be located at that time. Based on these findings the National Trust formed the opinion that the building should be preserved in its present form and not reconstructed to its windmill form. In 1982 City Council undertook some external maintenance work on the observation house or cabin, including replacement of deteriorated timber to the balcony and sills, and corrugated iron on the roof, and repair of the time ball and its mast (which was shortened by about to remove some part affected by dry rot). In 1987 a consortium of companies involved in the construction of the Central Plaza office building offered to assist the Brisbane City Council with the conservation of the Windmill Tower. To inform this work a conservation study was undertaken by Allom Lovell Marquis-Kyle Architects, which also oversaw conservation work. Preliminary archaeological investigations undertaken at this time identified the remains of the original flagstaff base which was reinstated. The conserved Windmill Tower was opened by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Sallyanne Atkinson, on 3 November 1988. A further archaeological investigation was carried out at the site in 1989-90 by a University of Queensland team, revealing clear stratigraphic layers datable to each of the key phases of use of the site. In August 1993 further investigations of the fabric of the tower were undertaken to explore the extent of the footings and the nature of construction of the curb and cap frame. More conservation work was carried out in May 1996. In 2009 the Brisbane City Council received considerable funding to carry out restoration work of the windmill tower through the Queensland Government's Q150 Connecting Brisbane project. It was intended that the structure be publicly accessible to allow visitors to experience the view from its observation platform, a practice that has been commented on since the 1860s. In 2008‚Äì2009 the Brisbane CBD Archaeological Plan assessed the area of the observatory reserve and a length of Wickham Terrace associated with it as having exceptional archaeological research potential because of the combination of its association with the penal settlement and the low level of ground disturbance that has occurred there since. =Hauntings= Paranormal researcher Joe Nickell visited the windmill October 2015 after learning that local paranormal groups considered the site haunted. The stories relate to the deaths of two Aboriginal men who were hanged from the upper window. In his investigation Nickell confirmed these deaths happened, but it was impossible for the execution to have happened inside the tower as \\"ghost raconteurs\\" have suggested. An often reported \\"light in the window\\" story was found to be typical of ghostlore and according to Nickell, \\"a simple illusion\\". In all, the investigation resulted in Nickell stating that the stories of the Tower Mill hauntings are the work \\"of some percipient's faulty imagination or the creation of a writer of fakelore.\\"  Description  Circular in plan, the windmill tower is largely made of rendered stone and brick. It tapers towards the top where it is surmounted by an observation platform with an iron railing, hexagonal timber cabin or observation house, and time ball and timber mast. At its base the tower is approximately in diameter, reducing to about at the top. Excluding the time ball and its mast, it stands at about in height on Wickham Terrace in Spring Hill, overlooking the modern office towers of Brisbane's central business district. The tower occupies the western end of the reserve, with the reconstructed flagstaff in its eastern half. Surrounding these is lawn. The boundary on Wickham Terrace is formed by a low stone wall with regular stone piers, between which are strung single chain guards, and a garden bed behind. About half way along its length is a decorative iron archway and stone stairs leading up to a concrete path to the entrance door of the tower. The rear reserve boundary marked by a hedge adjoins that of the Spring Hill Reservoirs, the three gable roofs of which nestle below the park lawn. These are places flanked by parks, Wickham Park to the west and King Edward Park to the east. Opposite the windmill tower is the cylindrical Tower Mill Hotel, opened in deliberately referencing its form. The tower sits on a circular sub-wall of Brisbane Tuff about thick, which is founded on bedrock. Standing on a plinth, the walls at the base are about thick, reducing at the top to about . To the ground and first floors the walls are stone (ashlar with lime mortar) with deep outer stone lintels above the door and window. This has been referred to as the reefing stage at about 3,190mm above ground. The reefing stage for a windmill is an exterior platform from where the miller can turn the cap via an endless chain hanging from the cap and access the sails. The earliest images of the windmill at Brisbane, those by Bowerman from the 1850s appear to show some kind of encircling platform at this reefing stage level. A photograph taken during restoration workHeritage Unit, Part 1, page 38 undertaken in 1988 while the render was being replaced seems to show a series of slots that may have held supports for a reefing stage. Behind these were middle and inner hardwood lintels, the former having been replaced with steel hollow sections in 1996. From the second floor to the underside of the cantilevered balcony the walls are English bond clay brick except for a segment on part of the third floor (at about above ground) where the outer half of the wall is stone with brick inside. Some random stones run the full width of the wall here. Six narrow, regularly spaced windows open out of this wall segment. There are low rise brick arches above them and timber middle and inner lintels. In the brick above this segment, on the inside, there are curved hardwood plates (these appear to be the remains of the windmill's curb support, curb and cap frame cut down by Andrew Petrie in 1861 to provide clearance for the stairway). These timbers appear to have been locally sourced and comprise grey ironbark and spotted gum and yellow wood (Eucalyptus siderophloia, Eucalyptus maculata and Flindersia xanthoxya). The entire exterior surface is rendered in a mock ashlar finish (substantially renewed in 1988). However the brick section was not first rendered until the 1880s and the stone plinth not until circa 1900.Heritage Unit, p. 37 A lip is created in the render surface at the first floor or reefing stage level. Above, below and around the upper ring of windows the render finish follows the simple stone frame. A single-level observation house and platform surmount the tower with a riveted copper time ball and painted hardwood mast projecting above it. On the windmill tower's interior the single volume spaces of each floor are punctuated by the hexagonal stair which connects the ground with the observatory house. The ground floor is a concrete slab while the upper floors are timber-framed with timber floor boards of hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii). The stair winds around a central newel and is lined with tongue-and-groove vertical boards. The treads were strengthened and protected from further wear during the 1988 conservation work. The bottom of the stair posts are founded in the ground floor concrete slab. The stair timbers are largely red cedar (Toona australis), expect for the boarding, which is hoop pine. The observation house is offset south of the tower's centreline and hexagonal in plan (the stairs are similarly offset). Its walls and five- faceted roof are timber-framed. Externally it is clad with chamferboards on the walls and metal sheeting on the roof. Internally it is lined with tongue- and-groove vertical boards. A door leads out to the circular balcony that surrounds it. The balustrade is wrought iron while the balcony floor is lined with flat copper sheets with timber duckboarding over. It is supported on the outside by closely spaced carved timber brackets. A round hardwood mast projects out of the roof of the cabin. It has a 160 square base, is lap- spliced inside the cabin to a 160 square post that carries down to the third floor. A riveted copper time-ball with central hole sits atop the cabin, with its hoisting rope running through top of the mast. As part of its function the time ball was raised to the top of the mast. The tower has five casement windows: two opposite the door, one above the other, another above the door and two more higher up facing north and south. The tiny windows that currently provide illumination for the top floor under the observation cabin are a unique aspect. The sliding windows in the lookout or observation house were installed in 1988 to resemble the originals. The timber double entrance door at the base of the tower has a stone drip mould over it, as do the casements. There is no clear sign of where the drive shaft from the external treadmill entered the tower, although the 1861 renovations may have disguised the entry point. The internal wall of the tower shows many signs of repair, any of which may be related to the treadmill operation. The ground floor wall of the tower shows a \\"closed-up opening\\" which may be the only surviving evidence of the location of the treadmill as the location where the shaft joining the two. The report does not give a location for this. Expert speculation about the format of the treadmill would suggest that the drive shaft connected to a short end of the treadmill.Conservation Plan, p. 16 The grounds surrounding the tower are grassed and sparsely landscaped and although there are no visible surface remnants, are likely to contain subsurface archaeological evidence of the use of the site over its entire history. The sections of Wickham Terrace and Bartley Street included within the heritage boundary have exceptional potential to contain remains of the convict-era treadmill. The road infrastructure, including the road surface, lighting and signage, is not of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  Windmill Tower was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Windmill Tower in Spring Hill is tangible evidence of the initial European occupation of the Moreton Bay area and important physical evidence of the development of it as a penal settlement, free settlement and separate colony. It is the oldest convict- built structure surviving in Queensland and the oldest extant windmill tower in Australia. The Windmill Tower is important in illustrating various key phases of the history of Brisbane. It has been used for a variety of purposes, including the grinding of grain and as a form of punishment for convicts, as a trigonometrical survey station, as a signal station for shipping, the Queensland Museum's first home, the official timekeeping device for the settlement, an observation tower, and as a site for wireless radio and telephony research and for early television research and broadcasting. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Windmill Tower is one of only two buildings to survive from the Moreton Bay penal settlement. It is distinctive amongst other early windmill towers around Australia in being the only surviving one built by convict labour. Other surviving towers, including the mill at South Perth in Western Australia (1837), the Callington Mill at Oatlands in Tasmania (1837), and the Mount Barker mill in South Australia (1842), were constructed by non- convict labour for free enterprise concerns. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The Windmill Tower has potential to contribute new knowledge and a greater understanding of Queensland's early settlement and development. Potential exists for archaeological evidence relating to all phases of occupation and use, particularly the convict period and evidence of the external treadmill layout and design, and the later signalman's cottage. Archaeological investigations at the Windmill Tower have the potential to contribute important new information about actual treadmill design and construction techniques, early punishment practices employed in Moreton Bay, the domestic conditions of mid to late nineteenth century Brisbane through artefact analysis, as well other previously unknown or undocumented uses of the windmill tower site. Archaeological evidence of the treadmill would illustrate nineteenth century punishment practices and the necessity of technological solutions for the grinding of enough grain to feed the fledgling settlement. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Being the oldest extant windmill tower in Australia, and Queensland's oldest stone building, the Windmill Tower in Brisbane is an exemplar of this class of cultural place. Its height and location on a central Brisbane hilltop are also important in demonstrating the characteristics of an early signal station, lookout and site for wireless radio, telephony and early television research. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Windmill Tower has great aesthetic significance for its landmark quality, being situated on a prominent hilltop overlooking central Brisbane; a quality widely acknowledged from the beginnings of free settlement until the present day. The unusual and characteristic shape of the structure is distinctive even in the earliest pictorial representations of the Brisbane landscape. Despite subsequent city development obscuring or entirely obliterating the views to it from other parts of the area, the windmill tower is still strongly evocative and symbolic of Queensland's convict past, one of its key periods of significance. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The use of the Windmill Tower as a signal station from 1855 demonstrates an aspect of innovative technology to develop a system of communication linking semaphore and electric telegraph to relay shipping news to the settlement. The tower is also an important reflection of the management of timekeeping in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries through the use of time balls and a time gun at the site from 1861 until 1930. The earliest research in Queensland into wireless radio and telephony was undertaken at the tower from 1922. Cutting edge television technology was also researched and demonstrated at the tower from 1924 until at least 1949. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Windmill Tower has a special association with the Brisbane and Queensland communities, serving as an important landmark and being a tangible and symbolic representation of European settlement of the state. The tower was recognised as early as 1850 for its landmark and picturesque qualities in a swell of public support against its proposed demolition. This public interest has been ongoing, demonstrated in concerns voiced to the present day over renovation and restoration.  In popular culture  In 2015 at the Urbne Festival in Brisbane, digital artist Alinta Krauth created the artwork, \\"Wind blisters those who try to run\\" exploring the history of the windmill, which was projected on the windmill during the festival.

Advanced stop lines are implemented widely in the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and other European countries but was first conceptualized by transportation planner Michael Lynch for the city of Portland, Oregon in response to numerous bike crashes at intersections. Description Most commonly associated with bicycles, they may also be provided for buses and motorcycles. There are two parallel stop lines at the intersection, the first one at which all traffic except that for which the facility is provided must stop, and a second one nearer the intersection to which only specified vehicles may proceed. If the signals change to red when a vehicle is crossing the first line, the driver must stop at the second line The area between the stop lines is the \\"reservoir\\" or \\"box\\". Signage may be required to inform road users as to the meaning of the extra stop line. A separate set of traffic signals may be provided for the specified traffic, but all vehicles usually use the same signals. Cyclists Advanced stop line in Gda≈Ñsk nearby the University of Gda≈Ñsk campus ASLs for cyclists are generally used in conjunction with some form of cycle lane for filtering cycle traffic. This arrangement theoretically allows cyclists to play to their strengths by regularising the practice of filtering to the top of queuing traffic during the red phase at traffic lights. Cyclists turning to the offside (i.e. right in the UK and Ireland, left in USA etc.) are able to take up a proper turning position. Straight-on cyclists can adopt and maintain a prominent position for transiting the junction safely within the main traffic stream. An ASL will also help reduce the exposure of such cyclists at junctions with nearside (i.e. left in the UK and Ireland, right in USA etc.) filter lights by providing a place for cyclists to wait while traffic passes on the inside. A similar consideration arises where a free turn to the nearside is permitted (called right turn on red in the US). At a red light, cyclists are more visible to motorists by being in front of them. At a green light, the green bike lane through the intersection reminds motorists and cyclists to watch for each other. Safety aspects Cyclists in a bike box in Toronto Based on Danish research, it is argued that an ASL should have the general stop line 5 m back from the main traffic signal. The reasoning is that this puts cyclists clearly into the view of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers, who have a blind spot up to 4 m directly in front of the cab. According to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) review, ASLs are also advocated as way of improving pedestrian safety at crossings by increasing the separation between crossing pedestrians and waiting motor vehicles. Although waiting cyclists might be safer out in front of HGVs, concerns have been expressed about nearside cycle lanes approaching such intersections may encourage cyclists to \\"creep up\\" on the inside of turning HGVs. Collisions with turning HGVs are strongly associated with a high risk of death and serious injury.Cyclists and Lorries, Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, February 2006 If the signal is green, cyclists are advised that the best way to minimize danger may be to stay within the main traffic stream. If the lights change while the cyclist is still approaching, the advice is to negotiate their way back into the main traffic stream if possible. Advice produced by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) regarding cyclists and lorries cautions cyclists that even though a junction has an ASL it may be better to wait if there is a lorry present. Portland, Oregon has implemented these \\"bike boxes\\" as they call them, to which bicyclists have claimed useful in aiding safety. The main goal is to prevent collisions between motorists turning right and cyclists going straight.Theenvironmentalblog.org Research performed by the Oregon Transportation Research and Education Consortium showed that motorists and cyclists alike appear to understand and comply with the boxes. Nearly three quarters of motorists stopped behind the bike box and roughly the same percentage of cyclists stopped at the proper location ahead of the motor vehicle stop bar. In addition, the number of conflicts at the intersections decreased and drivers yielded more to cyclists after the boxes were installed. User perceptions of safety also improved.

He was best known for his work on race and social class and for his call to abolish \\"whiteness\\". Ignatiev was the co-founder of the New Abolitionist Society and co-editor of the journal Race Traitor, which promoted the idea that \\"treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity\\". He also wrote a book on antebellum Northern xenophobia against Irish immigrants, How the Irish Became White. His publisher billed him as \\"one of America's leading and most controversial historians\\".  Early life and career  Ignatiev was born Noel Saul Ignatin in Philadelphia, the son of Carrie, a homemaker, and Irv Ignatin, who delivered newspapers. His family's original surname, Ignatiev, was changed to Ignatin and later back to the original spelling. His family was Jewish. His grandparents were from Russia. Ignatiev's parents later ran a housewares store. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, but dropped out after three years. Under the name Noel Ignatin, he joined the Communist Party USA in January 1958, but in August left (along with Theodore W. Allen and Harry Haywood) to help form the Provisional Organizing Committee to Reconstitute the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Communist Party (POC). He was expelled from the POC in 1966. He later became involved in the Students for a Democratic Society. When that organization fractured in the late 1960s, Ignatiev became part of the group Sojourner Truth Organization (STO) in 1970. Unlike other groups in the New Communist movement, the STO and Ignatiev were also heavily influenced by the ideas of Trinidadian writer C. L. R. James. For twenty years, Ignatiev worked in a Gary, Indiana steel mill and also in the manufacturing of farming equipment and electrical components. A Marxist activist, he was involved in efforts by African American steel workers to achieve equality in the mills. In 1984, he was laid off from the steel mill, approximately a year after an arrest on charges of attacking a strike- breaker's car with a paint bomb.  Academic career  Ignatiev set up Marxist discussion groups in the early 1980s. In 1985, Ignatiev was accepted to the Harvard Graduate School of Education without an undergraduate degree. After earning his master's degree, he joined the Harvard faculty as a lecturer and worked toward a doctorate in U.S. history. Ignatiev was a graduate student at Harvard University where he earned his Ph.D. in 1995. He taught courses there before moving to the Massachusetts College of Art. His academic work was linked to his call to \\"abolish\\" the white race, a controversial slogan whose meaning is not always agreed upon by those who debate his work. His dissertation, published by Routledge as the book How the Irish Became White, was advised by prominent social historian of American race and ethnicity Stephan Thernstrom. Ignatiev was the co-founder and co-editor of the journal Race Traitor and the New Abolitionist Society.  Ideas and controversies  = Views of race = Ignatiev viewed race distinctions and race itself as a social construct, not a scientific reality.Smedley, Audrey (2007-March-14-17). \\"The History of the Idea of Race... and Why It Matters\\". presented at the conference \\"Race, Human Variation and Disease: Consensus and Frontiers\\" sponsored by the American Anthropological Association (AAA). Sober, Elliott (2000). Philosophy of biology (2nd ed.). Boulder, CO: Westview Press. . Ignatiev's study of Irish immigrants in the 19th-century United States argued that an Irish triumph over nativism marks the incorporation of the Irish into the dominant group of American society. Ignatiev asserted that the Irish were not initially accepted as white by the dominant English-American population. He claimed that only through their own violence against free blacks and support of slavery did the Irish gain acceptance as white. Ignatiev defined whiteness as the access to white privilege, which according to Ignatiev gains people perceived to have \\"white\\" skin admission to certain neighborhoods, schools, and jobs. In the 19th century, whiteness was strongly associated with political power, especially suffrage. Ignatiev's book on Irish immigrants has been criticized for \\"conflat[ing] race and economic position\\" and for ignoring data that contradicts his theses. Ignatiev stated that attempts to give race a biological foundation have only led to absurdities as in the common example that a white woman could give birth to a black child, but a black woman could never give birth to a white child. Ignatiev asserted that the only logical explanation for this notion is that people are members of different racial categories because society assigns people to these categories. = \\"New abolition\\" and the \\"white race\\" = Ignatiev's web site and publication Race Traitor displayed the motto \\"treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity\\". In response to a letter to the site which understood the motto as meaning that the authors \\"hated\\" white people because of their \\"white skin\\", Ignatiev and the other editors responded: In September 2002, Harvard Magazine published an excerpt from When Race Becomes Real: Black and White Writers Confront Their Personal Histories, edited by Bernestine Singley, about Ignatiev's role in launching Race Traitor. In the excerpt, Ignatiev wrote that \\"[t]he goal of abolishing the white race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed white supremacists\\". He wrote that the magazine's editors were frequently accused of being racists or part of a hate group, to which his \\"standard response\\" was \\"to draw an analogy with anti-royalism: to oppose monarchy does not mean killing the king; it means getting rid of crowns, thrones, royal titles, etc.\\" Ignatiev also wrote that \\"[t]he editors meant it when they replied to a reader, 'Make no mistake about it: we intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as \\"the white race\\" is destroyed‚Äînot \\"deconstructed\\" but destroyed'\\". Some conservative critics, particularly David Horowitz, saw the excerpt as an example of institutional racism against white people at Harvard, in \\"progressive culture\\" and in academia. On his website, Horowitz wrote: \\"Suppose Frontpagemagazine.com ran a headline 'Abolish the Black Race'? What do you think the reaction would be? But at Harvard, where demonizing whites is merely the standard curriculum, an article like this can appear in a glossy magazine whose cover story is 'Whither the Art Museum?'\\". = Toaster controversy = From 1986 until 1992, Ignatiev served as a tutor (academic adviser) for Dunster House at Harvard College. In early 1992, Ignatiev objected to the university's purchase of a toaster oven for the Dunster House dining hall that would be designated for kosher use only. He insisted that cooking utensils with restricted use should be paid for by private funds. In a letter to the Harvard student newspaper, the Harvard Crimson, Ignatiev wrote: \\"I regard anti-Semitism, like all forms of religious, ethnic and racial bigotry, as a crime against humanity and whoever calls me an anti-Semite will face a libel suit\\". Dunster House subsequently declined to renew Ignatiev's contract, saying that his conduct during the dispute was \\"unbecoming of a Harvard tutor\\". Dunster co-master Hetty Liem said it was the job of a tutor \\"to foster a sense of community and tolerance and to serve as a role model for the students\\" and that Ignatiev had not done so. = Encyclopedia of Race and Racism = In 2008, the American Jewish Committee objected to an encyclopedia article on Zionism that Ignatiev wrote for The Encyclopedia of Race and Racism.AJC: Withdraw Zionism chapter in race book , December 10, 2008, Jewish Telegraphic Agency In the article, Ignatiev described Israel as a \\"racial state, where rights are assigned on the basis of ascribed descent or the approval of the superior race\\" and likened it to Nazi Germany and the Southern United States before the civil rights movement.\\"Zionism\\", Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, Macmillan Press, 2007, pp 240‚Äì244. The American Jewish Committee questioned why the encyclopedia included an entry about Zionism, stating that it was the only nationalist movement with an article in the encyclopedia. Gideon Shimoni, Professor Emeritus at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, criticized the article as a \\"litany of errors and distortions of fact\\".Gideon Shimoni, A Comment on the Entry \\"Zionism\\" in the Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, December 1, 2008. Subsequently, the encyclopedia's publisher Gale announced the appointment of an independent committee to investigate \\"the factual accuracy, scholarly basis, coverage, scope, and balance of every article\\". In addition, Gale published a 10-part composite article, \\"Nationalism and Ethnicity\\", with a new article on Zionism and evaluations of cultural nationalism in across the globe. The composite article was free of charge to all customers. In response to the findings of the independent committee, Gale has eliminated Ignatiev's article from the encyclopedia. Death Ignatiev spoke at a bar in Brooklyn, New York, on October 27, 2019, at the launch party for an issue of the journal Hard Crackers, which he edited. Soon after, he flew to Arizona to be with members of his family. On November 9, Ignatiev died at Banner University Medical Center Tucson at the age of 78.

The general term retractor usually describes a simple handheld steel tool possessing a curved, hooked, or angled blade and fitted with a comfortable handle, that when in place maintains the desired position of a given region of tissue. These simple retractors may be handheld, clamped in place, or suspended at the end of a robotic arm. Retractors can also be self-retaining and not need to be held once inserted by having two or more opposing blades or hooks which are separated via spring, ratchet, worm gear or other method. The term retractor is also used to describe distinct, hand-cranked devices such as rib spreaders (also known as thoracic retractors, or distractors) with which surgeons may forcefully drive tissues apart to obtain exposure. For specialized situations such as spinal surgery, retractors have been fitted both with suction and with fiberoptic lights to keep a surgical wound dry and illuminated.  History  Surgical retractors probably originate with very basic tools used in the Stone Age. Branches or antlers of various shapes were used to dig and extract food from the ground. As the use of tools evolved, a variety of instruments came about to substitute for the use of hooked or grasping fingers in the butchering of meat or dissection of bodies. The use of metals in tool making was of great importance. A variety of Roman metal instruments of the hook and retractor family have been found by archeologists. These instruments would generally be called hooks if the end was as narrow as the handle of the instrument. If the end was broad, it would be called a retractor. Also arising from this group of tools were other related tools for displacing (elevators and spatulas) and scooping (spoons and curettes). In 4th century CE, Indian physician Susruta used surgical tools such as retractors. In a description of the procedure of tonsillectomy from the 7th century CE, Paul of Aegina documents the use of a tongue spatula to keep the tongue out of the way while a form of tonsil hook is used to bring the tonsil forward for excision. In 1000 CE Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi, also known as Albucasis or Abulcasis, described a variety of surgical instruments including retractors in his famous text Al-Tasrif. Vesalius described a variety of hooks and retractors in the 16th century. Jan Mikulicz-Radecki's invention of a hinged rib spreading retractor in 1904 prompted a flurry of development of retractors in the early 20th century, culminating in 1936 in our modern device based on the design of Enrique Finochietto.

Biography Siegmund Lubin was born as Zygmunt Lubszy≈Ñski, a son of Samuel Lubszy≈Ñski and Rebeka Lubszy≈Ñska, Polish Jews, in Breslau, Germany (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland) or in Pozna≈Ñ on April 20, 1851. His father was a successful ophthalmologist. the Lubszy≈Ñski family moved to Berlin soon after Zygmunt birth for economic reasons. Young Zygmunt Germanicized his first name to Siegmund and graduated from the University of Heidelberg. In 1876 he emigrated to the United States, where he also worked as an optometrist in Philadelphia. Around 1881, he shortened his surname from the Polish Lubszy≈Ñski to Lubin. He soon progressed to making his own camera and projector combination, which he sold. In 1896 he began distributing films for Thomas Edison. In 1897 he started making films, notably Meet Me at the Fountain in 1904, and in 1902 formed the Lubin Manufacturing Company, incorporating it in 1909. His company also sold illegally copied prints of many films by other directors, notably those of Georges M√©li√®s, making Lubin one of the foremost early practitioners of film piracy. By 1910 his company had built a film studio, \\"Lubinville\\", in Philadelphia, at Twentieth Avenue and Indiana Street. A fire at its studio in June 1914 destroyed the negatives for his unreleased new films. When World War I broke out in Europe in September of that year, Lubin Studios was among the American filmmakers who lost foreign sales. The Lubin Film Company went out of business on September 1, 1917, after having made more than a thousand motion pictures. Siegmund went back to work as an optometrist. He died on September 11, 1923 at his home in Ventnor, New Jersey. He was buried on September 14, 1923.

The island is historically significant as the site of a trading port and stop-over between Australia and East Asia. Samarai town was established on the island and at its height was the second largest after Port Moresby in the Territory of Papua. The town of Samarai was ordered to be destroyed by the Australian Government during World War II, fearing Japanese occupation. Although rebuilt after the war, and functioning as provincial headquarters until 1968, economic changes meant that Samarai did not fully regain its regional status and it has since largely fallen into disrepair. The island was declared a National Historical Heritage Island by the government of Papua New Guinea in 2006.Lonely Planet  Geography  Located off the south-eastern tip of New Guinea in the China Strait, Samarai has an area of just or 29 hectares. At the census of population 2014, the island had a population of 460, making it one of the most densely populated islands in the area. The island is part of the Samarai Islands of the Louisiade Archipelago. History =Settlement= The island was discovered by Captain John Moresby whilst commanding HMS Basilisk in 1873. Moresby originally called the island Dinner Island, after having a meal on it. Five years later in 1878 the Rev. S. MacFarlane of the London Missionary Society established a mission station on the island. A government officer was posted to the island after a protectorate had been declared over British New Guinea. In 1884 a trader and sixty Papuans established a beach front store for passing ships. In the early years a large malarious swamp caused health problems for Samarai, but this was improved after 1898 when it was filled in. After the annexation of British New Guinea in 1888, Samarai became the headquarters of an administrative district. A court was subsequently established and a magistrate posted. Destroyed buildings on Samarai in 1942 By the 20th century the island was a bustling cosmopolitan port town, administrative centre and major commercial centre. It was noted for its size and attractive appearance. In 1902 the value of goods exported from Samarai was three times the value of those exported from Port Moresby. By 1907 there were three pubs, the seat of a bishop, a rectory, church, three stores, government buildings, hospitals and private residences. Electric power was provided by 1927 and street lighting was installed. =Decline and World War II= By the 1920s the town had declined in importance and by the 1940s 70 percent of goods were now exported from Port Moresby, although Samarai was still significant in the trade of copra. In 1940 Sir Hubert Murray, the Lieutenant-Governor of the Territory of Papua, travelled to Samarai, after falling ill, and subsequently died on the island. After the outbreak of World War II and with the Japanese advance into the Pacific the Australian Government ordered the evacuation of Samarai in January 1942 and later in the year it was destroyed to stop the wharves and buildings falling under Japanese control. In July 1943 a detachment of US Navy Seabees established a small seaplane base on the island. Despite a lack of materials the base including a ramp and hangar was constructed in 42 days. Although Samarai was reestablished after the war, it never returned to its former size or influence and in 1968 the provincial capital for Milne Bay was moved to Alotau. Today the island is mostly isolated and little belies its past. In 2006 the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Michael Somare, declared the island a National Historical Heritage Island, and vowed to \\"restore basic services and refurbish its monuments and buildings as a tourist attraction\\".

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a United States Senator from New Hampshire from 1962 to 1979. Early life and education Thomas McIntyre was born in Laconia, New Hampshire, to Thomas James and Helen Grey (n√©e Trask) McIntyre. He received his early education at parochial and public schools in Laconia. Shortly after his mother's death in 1927, he entered Manlius Military School in Onondaga County, New York. He graduated from Manlius in 1933 and, returning to New Hampshire, enrolled at Dartmouth College in Hanover. During college, he was a member of the Green Key Society and the Palaeopitus Senior Society. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and political science from Dartmouth in 1937. McIntyre then studied at the Boston University School of Law in Massachusetts, receiving his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1940. In May 1941, he married Myrtle Ann Clement, to whom he remained married until his death; the couple had one daughter, Martha. Early career In 1940, McIntyre was admitted to the bar and joined the law office of former Senator Robert W. Upton in Concord. He returned to Laconia following his father's death in 1941, and there opened his own practice. During World War II, he served in the United States Army from 1942 to 1946. He was first commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army Reserve, training at Camp Croft in South Carolina (now Croft State Park) and at Fort Benning in Georgia. He was then assigned to the 94th Infantry Division and later served in the Third Army under General George S. Patton, participating in all the major European campaigns. At the end of the war, he was made a military government judge of the Amtsgericht (lower court) in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. He was discharged as a major, and earned four battle stars, the Combat Infantryman Badge, and the Bronze Star Medal. Following his military service, McIntyre returned to Laconia and joined the law office of Harold E. Westcott in 1946. He opened his own office after Wescott was made a judge of the New Hampshire Superior Court. He also joined his brother as a partner in McIntyre Properties, a firm that owned and managed rental real estate, and served as president of the Community TV Corporation, which specialized in television antennae. A Democrat, McIntyre served as mayor of Laconia from 1949 to 1951. During his administration, he oversaw the construction of a sewage disposal plant and a municipal bathing beach. He declined a run for Governor of New Hampshire in 1950, and served as city solicitor of Laconia in 1953. In 1954, McIntyre won the Democratic nomination for the United States House of Representatives from New Hampshire's 1st congressional district. In the general election, he faced seven-term Republican incumbent Chester Earl Merrow. He was narrowly defeated by Merrow in November, losing by only 468 votes. A recount was subsequently held, but McIntyre still trailed Merrow by 397 votes. He later served as chairman of the Laconia Democratic Committee and the Belknap County Democratic Committee, and was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention. He was also director of the Laconia-Weirs Beach Chamber of Commerce (1960‚Äì1963) and of the Laconia Development Corporation (1962). In 1980, he was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. U.S. Senate Following the death of Senator Styles Bridges in November 1961, McIntyre ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination to fill Bridges's unexpired term in the United States Senate. His chances for victory were enhanced by a bitter four-way primary in the Republican Party between Maurice J. Murphy, Jr., who had been appointed by Governor Wesley Powell to Bridges's seat; the Senator's widow, Doloris Bridges; and the state's two U.S. Representatives, Perkins Bass and Chester Merrow. Bass ultimately won the nomination, and faced McIntyre in the general election. During the campaign, McIntyre ran on a platform supporting President John F. Kennedy's proposal for federal aid to education and for medical care to the elderly under Social Security. In the special election on November 6, 1962, he defeated Bass by a vote of 117,612 to 107,199. He was the first Democratic Senator elected from New Hampshire since Fred H. Brown in 1932. Senator McIntyre, Senator Ted Kennedy, Governor Hugh Gallen, and Executive Councilor Dudley Dudley McIntyre was officially seated in the Senate on November 13, 1962. During his tenure, he served as chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Research and Development; of the Banking Subcommittee on Financial Institutions; and of the Small Business Subcommittee on Government Regulation. He supported the Kennedy administration on national wilderness preservation, youth employment, and increased area redevelopment aid, but opposed Kennedy's proposal for mass transportation. He supported an amendment by Senator Richard Russell, Jr. to remove funds for the Nike-Zeus antimissile system from a defense procurement bill, and endorsed a motion by Senator Margaret Chase Smith to add $134,000,000 for two additional nuclear submarines to the same bill. He sponsored the law creating share-draft checking accounts for savings institutions. In 1967, as subcommittee chairman on the Banking Committee, he demonstrated that he could beat the recommendations of stock investors by throwing darts at stock listings. McIntyre won a full term in 1966, defeating retired pilot Harrison Thyng to become the first Democratic Senator in the state's history to win a second term. Originally a strong supporter of the Vietnam War, he served as co-chairman of President Lyndon B. Johnson's campaign in New Hampshire in the 1968 election and called Johnson's primary opponent, Senator Eugene McCarthy, an \\"appeaser.\\" However, he later came to oppose the war, saying, \\"Our nation is tearing itself apart.\\" He was re- elected to a third term in 1972, defeating former Governor Powell by 57%-43%. McIntyre led an unsuccessful attempt to filibuster George H. W. Bush's confirmation as Director of Central Intelligence in 1976, believing the former chairman of the Republican National Committee would politicize the agency. In 1978, he was narrowly defeated for re-election to a fourth term by Gordon Humphrey, who took advantage of a nationwide conservative movement and McIntyre's tendency to spend more time in Florida than in New Hampshire. Later life and death Recognizing the rising power of the New Right in his defeat, McIntyre published The Fear Brokers, in 1979, co-authored with John Obert. In his book, McIntyre described the forces and personalities of the New Right across the nation, focusing particularly on the struggle in his home state.McIntyre, Thomas J. with John C. Obert.

Juno was assigned to the 11th Cruiser Squadron operating from Ireland. In 1901, she was one of two escort ships for HMS Ophir, which carried the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary) during their tour of the British Empire. The following year she served in the cruiser squadron under the command of Captain Henry Peter Routh. In May 1902 she was taken into Portsmouth for a refit, and the following month Captain David Beatty was appointed in command. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII, and visited the Aegean Sea for combined manoeuvres with other ships of the Channel squadron and Mediterranean Fleet the following month. After returning to Portsmouth in October, she carried the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland and Lady Dudley on a visit to Waterford on 29 October. She was posted to the Mediterranean Fleet later that year, but Beatty paid her off not long after. In 1915 she was sent to the Persian Gulf and took part in an engagement at Bushire in July ‚Äì August 1915 against Tangistani raids under Rais Ali Delvari. Juno was returning to Queenstown, Ireland. Having received warning of submarine activity off Queenstown, the cruiser took evasive action and eventually returned to port. This warning was not extended to RMS Lusitania, which was sunk by a U Boat on Friday, 7 May 1915. Juno was sold for scrap in 1920.

After failing to make the field for each of the early attempts, Shepherd and the team went their separate ways and the team changed its name to CJM Racing.

It was built at the Odense Staalskibsv√¶rft shipyard in Odense, Denmark, and launched on 16 February 1974. Ship history The Atlantic Empress was a large crude oil carrier built at the Odense Staalskibsv√¶rft shipyard in Odense, Denmark, and launched on 16 February 1974. At the time of her sinking, she was owned by the South Gulf Shipping Company of Greece, and flagged in Liberia. =Collision and sinking= On 19 July 1979 Atlantic Empress collided with the Aegean Captain, another fully laden Greek supertanker, east of the island of Tobago. At the time of the collision Atlantic Empress was sailing from Saudi Arabia to Beaumont, Texas, with a cargo of light crude oil owned by Mobil Oil. Aegean Captain was en route to Singapore from Aruba. In heavy rain and thick fog the two ships did not sight each other until they were apart. Aegean Captain changed course, but it was too late; at 7:15 p.m, the two ships collided, with the Empress tearing a hole in the Captains starboard bow. Large fires began on each ship, which were soon beyond the control of the crews, who abandoned their ships. The collision and fire claimed the lives of 26 of the Empresss crew members, and one crew member on the Captain. The remaining crew from both ships were taken to Tobago for medical treatment, while the Empresss captain was transported to a hospital in Texas, having inhaled fire. Firefighters from the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard brought the fires aboard the Captain under control the next day, and members of her crew returned to the ship, and were able to bring her into Cura√ßao, where her cargo was off- loaded. Meanwhile, a five-man specialist emergency crew from the Dutch Salvage organization Smit International Jan Sonneveld, one of the five salvage team and the German Bugsier, managed by a Salvage inspector of Smit International, attempted to control the fire aboard Empress, and contain the spreading oil slick. Two tugs (one of them being the Smit Zwarte Zee) towed the burning ship further out to sea. On 24 July, a week after the collision, the Empress was still burning, and also listing, when an explosion occurred that increased the rate of flow. The next day another larger explosion increased the rate to , twice the previous rate. Finally, on 3 August, the Empress sank, having spilled 287,000 metric tonnes of crude oil into the Caribbean Sea. By comparison, in the Exxon Valdez spill ten years later 37,000 metric tonnes of oil was released.

Manukyan lost both of his parents and a sister in the 1988 Armenian earthquake. According to him, this tragedy helped him in wrestling. He became a junior world champion twice in 1990 and 1991. From 1993 to 1996, Manukyan was a member of the Armenia national Greco-Roman wrestling team. He won bronze medals at the 1995 World Wrestling Championships and 1996 European Wrestling Championships.

In January 2001, Manukyan underwent a complex surgery on the cervical vertebrae due to a serious back injury, and could not recover to his previous level. Yet he was selected for the 2004 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal. In the semifinal, he suffered his only loss to Seref Eroglu, while leading 3‚Äì2, and then defeated Jimmy Samuelsson. Manukyan retired in 2005 to become an assistant coach, and later the head coach of the Kazakhstan Greco-Roman wrestling team.

He then became a lecturer at the University of North London, with a specialism in European social policy. He joined the Labour Party and served on Harlow District Council.

In his speech on election night in June 1994, he chided Rawlings (now Baroness Rawlings of Burnham Westgate) for not attending any of the series of pre-election hustings throughout the euro-constituency where local issues had been debated by the other candidates in her absence.

The dissident Kerr was suspended by the National Executive Committee and later expelled from the Labour Party along with fellow dissident Ken Coates MEP, with whom he then formed the Independent Labour Network. He left the Party of European Socialists and joined forces with The Green Group in the European Parliament, becoming the first Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) MEP. At the June 1999 European Parliament election, with voting on the basis of proportional representation throughout the United Kingdom, Kerr was at the top of the SSP's party list for Scotland's seven European seats but the party's share of the vote was too low to secure his re-election as an MEP. Back to Scotland After a period living in Australia, Kerr returned to Scotland and worked as press officer to Tommy Sheridan MSP. In the May 2003 Scottish Parliamentary Elections, Kerr stood as an SSP candidate for the East Lothian constituency but gained only 1,380 votes (4.42%). Kerr was no. 3 on the SSP's list of candidates at the June 2004 European Parliamentary Election, but it did not get any candidates elected. His share of the vote at the Kilmarnock and Loudoun constituency in the 2005 General Election slumped to 1.9% (833 votes). Kerr resigned from the SSP in September 2006 to become the Press Officer of Solidarity, a new party led by Sheridan, but left the party in 2011 to join the Scottish National Party.BBC report on Kerr joining the SNPScotsman article re Kerr joining the SNP Kerr resigned from the SNP in 2016, in protest against party leader Nicola Sturgeon holding a copy of the Scottish Sun newspaper.

The boundaries of the Naga Hills District were gradually expanded by annexation of the territories of several Naga tribes, including the Aos (1889), the Semas (1904) and the Konyaks (1910). In 1912, the district was made part of Assam province. Following the Partition of India, it was merged with the Tuensang Division to create the state called Nagaland in 1963.

It is claimed to be the original house named in the American poem \\"Over the River and through the Wood\\" by Lydia Maria Child. (Although many people sing \\"to grandmother's house we go\\", the author's original words were \\"to grandfather's house we go\\".) The house, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, is also noteworthy for being the best preserved example of Greek Revival architecture in Medford, and for its association with Paul Curtis, a prominent local shipbuilder. The rear portion of the modern house was built as a small farmhouse in the early 19th century. Child recalled the farmhouse when she wrote of her childhood visits to her grandfather's house in her poem, published in 1844. The house is located near the Mystic River, which is believed to be the river referred to in the poem. The referenced woods have long since been replaced by residential housing. About 1839, Curtis greatly enlarged the house and gave it its two- story Ionic portico. In 1975, the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1976, Tufts University purchased and restored the house. In 2013 the house was sold to a developer who divided the lot the house sits on in order to build a duplex next door. In 2014 the house was again sold without its former yard to a private individual. In the 19th century, ships were built across the street. A painting hung in the house shows a ship being built, with the house across the river, and Ballou Hall (the original Tufts building) on top of the hill in the distance, with no other development in between.

Following the Soviet occupation and the Communist takeover in the country, the square was renamed to Moszkva t√©r in 1951 under the R√°kosi regime. Following the fall of communist regimes in Eastern Europe, it was debated whether it should be renamed again to the original Sz√©ll K√°lm√°n, but initially the name remained. During the first part of the 1956 revolution Soviet troops (who at the time were stationed in the western part of the country, near Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r) tried to capture the city, attacking towards this square.

The station stands where R√°k√≥czi √∫t splits to become Kerepesi Avenue and Th√∂k√∂ly Avenue. Keleti p√°lyaudvar translates to Eastern Railway Terminus. Its name in 1891 originates not only for its position as the easternmost of the city's rail termini, but for its original role as a terminus of the lines from eastern Hungary including Transylvania, and the Balkans. In contrast, the Nyugati (western) railway station used to serve lines toward Vienna and Paris. Architecture The building was designed in eclectic style by Gyula Rochlitz and J√°nos Feketeh√°zy and constructed between 1881 and 1884. The main fa√ßade is adorned with two statues depicting James Watt and George Stephenson. Inside the station are frescos by Karoly Lotz.

Its most notable landmark is the Hungarian Parliament Building (). There is a station of the M2 (East-West) line of the Budapest Metro on the square as well as a stop for the scenic Tram No. 2.https://www.bkv.hu/en/our_thematic_routes_with_/  Name and history  The square, renamed in 1927 in honor of Lajos Kossuth, was previously known by several names including; Orsz√°gh√°z t√©r (\\"Parliament Square\\") (1898‚Äì1927), T√∂m≈ë t√©r or Stadt Schopper Platz in German (\\"Landfill Square\\") (1853‚Äì1898). This name recalls how the low-lying territory flanking the river, then outside the town of Pest, was filled with rubbish to raise the level of the ground. The first recorded name was Stadtischer Auswind Platz (\\"Unloading Square for the Ships\\") in 1820. In the second half of the 19th century, great public buildings were erected on the square and it became the symbolic centre of the Hungarian state. The Hungarian Parliament Building is located on the square. Facing the parliament building is the Museum of Ethnography (originally the Palace of Justice) and the Ministry of Agriculture. After World War II, a temporary bridge across the Danube, Kossuth h√≠d, was built between Lajos Kossuth Square and Batthy√°ny Square, and functioned from 1946 until 1960. It was dismantled when most of the permanent bridges were re-built. It is marked with memorial stones on the Pest and the Buda sides. In its place, a pontoon bridge was built in 1973 and in 2003, for a few days around national holidays. From 17 September 2006 Kossuth Square was the scene of the great anti- government demonstrations against Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny triggered by the release of Gyurcs√°ny's speech in which he confessed that he had lied to win the 2006 elections. Until 23 October the square was continuously occupied by the demonstrators. After the 23 October riots the police closed off the square with cordons. The long closure of square caused controversy. The cordons were removed only on 19 March 2007. The damaged park was subsequently restored and the square was given back to the public. The square was closed again in 2012 by a decision of the Parliament in order to restore its original, pre-1944 view.Reconstruction of Budapest‚Äôs Kossuth t√©r goes ahead The square was reopened in 2014 as a no-traffic zone with a sustainable park, updated tracks for tram No. 2, an underground parking garage, sculptures, and a memorial to the victims of the Kossuth T√©r massacre on 25 October 1956. Memorials In front of the Parliament building are the Kossuth Memorial and an equestrian statue of Francis II R√°k√≥czi, as well as a memorial for the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. A modern statue of Attila J√≥zsef is nearby, south of the Parliament, sitting on the bank of the river (actually he is sitting on a grassy mound quite far from the water) as described in his poem By the Danube.‚ÄúOn the bottom step that from the wharf descends / I sat, and watched a melon-rind float by.‚Äù (translation by Vernon Watkins; see By the Danube at Babelmatrix) There is also a monument for Imre Nagy located on the square. Monument events 1956 Budapest.jpgA memorial of the 1956 revolution =The Kossuth T√©r Massacre Memorial= A memorial for the 25 October massacre at Kossuth T√©r in Budapest, Hungary. A memorial to the victims of the 25 October 1956 massacre at Kossuth t√©r was created in the southern ventilation tunnel as part of the 2012-2014 reconstruction of the square. The memorial remembers the unarmed victims who gathered on this \\"Bloody Thursday\\" as part of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution with videos, photos, candles, and memorabilia of the era. Little information is certain about this massacre, from who fired the first shot and why to how the protesters were led to gather in that location on that day to the death toll of the event. Sources cite as few as 22 shot dead up to as many as 1000. British officials cite the number as being between 300 and 800. The memorial asks anyone with information on the massacre to report it to officials to help complete the story.

They may also reveal significant parts of the story that have not yet occurred, but soon will in greater detail. It is similar to foreshadowing, in which future events are not shown but rather implicitly hinted at. It is also similar to an ellipsis, however an ellipsis takes the narrative forward and is intended to skim over boring or uninteresting details, for example the aging of a character. It is primarily a postmodern narrative device, named by analogy to the more traditional flashback, which reveals events that occurred in the past.  Examples in literature  An early example of prolepsis which predates the postmodern period is Charles Dickens' novel A Christmas Carol, in which the protagonist Ebenezer Scrooge is shown the future following his death. The subsequent events of the story imply that this future will be averted by this foreknowledge. Terry Brooks' Word & Void series features a protagonist who, when he sleeps, moves forwards and backwards through time to before and after a great cataclysm. This is both analepsis and prolepsis. Muriel Spark makes extensive use of prolepsis in her novel The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.  Examples in television  Every season of Damages makes an extensive use of flashforwards, revealing the outcome of the season to the viewer. The whole season then revolves around discovering the circumstances that led to this outcome. For instance, the first season starts with a flashforward of the protagonist, Ellen Parsons, running in the streets of New York, covered in blood. 6 months earlier, she was only a naive young woman who had just become a lawyer in the firm of a powerful attorney, Patty Hewes. What led Ellen to the situation presented in the flashforwards is revealed little by little throughout the season. Furthermore, the series is known for its misleading use of flashforwards, which are often examples of the red herring device. After making extensive use of flashbacks in the first two seasons, the TV series Lost started using flashforwards as well throughout the remainder of the series. The first instance of this was a major plot twist in the third season finale: what appeared to be a flashback to before the characters were stranded on the island, was revealed at the end of the two-part episode to be a flashforward of them returned to civilization. A later episode featured what appeared to be flashforwards involving the couple Jin and Sun, showing them safely returned home and awaiting the birth of their baby, but it is then revealed that Jin's scenes were flashbacks and only Sun's were flashforwards (reflecting the fact that they are separated in time and space). The series finale of Star Trek: Voyager, \\"Endgame\\", uses a technique similar to a flashforward. It depicts a future in which the U.S.S. Voyager has returned home after decades lost in deep space with various personal tragedies, prompting the ship's captain to use time travel to return to the timeframe of the series and return the crew home more directly. The U.S. sci-fi TV series FlashForward revolves around everyone on Earth losing consciousness for 137 seconds, during which each person experiences a glimpse of events 6 months in the future.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441135 The series was itself based loosely on the novel Flashforward by Robert J. Sawyer. British soap opera Hollyoaks flashed forward six months in May 2010 for a special episode. The last episode of Six Feet Under ends with an extensive flashforward depicting the deaths of all the central characters for several decades in the future. Breaking Bad uses flashforwards throughout its second season showing a mystery regarding debris and corpses in Walter White's house and neighborhood, revealed to be the result of two planes crashing overhead. The first half of the fifth season begins with a flashforward one year into the future where Walter is fifty-two years old, and the second half begins with a continuation of the story, where he returns to his abandoned home. The plot of these flashforwards is resumed in the series finale. Better Call Saul, a spin-off of Breaking Bad, follows a trend of starting each season with a flashforward scene, set after the events of Breaking Bad (and thus several years in the future relative to the time frame of the events narrated in Better Call Saul), and shot in black and white. How to Get Away with Murder used in every episode flashforwards of scenes from future episodes until ninth episode of the first season. Quantico used flashforwards in order to unravel the future events that have occurred in the first and second season. The Netflix series Elite used flashforwards to unravel the murder mystery of a future event, in the first season. The Netflix series Quicksand used flashforwards to unravel the circumstances leading to a school shooting, in the first season. The CW series Arrow utilizes flashforwards in its seventh season, having previously employed extensive flashbacks for its first five seasons. Hollyoaks have a flashforward to New Year's Eve 2020 to see where the characters are in a year's time.  Examples in film  Midway through the film They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, there is an abrupt flashforward when Robert, the character played by Michael Sarrazin, is seen being thrust into a jail cell by a police officer, even though he has done nothing to provoke such treatment. The audience is notified, later in the story, that Sarrazin's character would have indeed made choices that warrant his arrest. The film Arrival relies extensively on prolepsis throughout the movie, disguised as flashbacks (like the aforementioned episode of Lost). The main character gains precognitive ability after learning the language of the aliens, and proceeds to use it to prevent the outbreak of war. She uses information revealed to her in the future to convince a military leader not to attack the aliens in the present.  Examples in video games  In Until Dawn, players may find artifacts left by the Native American tribe who lived on the mountain that show premonitions of possible future events. Whether they come true is dependent on player actions; for example, one shows another character's death in a scene that can be avoided.

As the first Bishop of Ravenna, he faced nearly constant persecution. He and his flock were exiled from Ravenna during the persecutions of Emperor Vespasian (or Nero, depending on the source). On his way out of the city he was identified, arrested as being the leader, tortured and martyred by being run through with a sword. Centuries after his death, he appeared in a vision to Saint Romuald. Other legends have him martyred under the Emperor Valens. The early 20th-century Catholic Encyclopaedia rendered the traditional version as follows: > He was made Bishop of Ravenna, Italy, by Saint Peter himself. The miracles > he wrought there soon attracted official attention, for they and his > preaching won many converts to the Faith, while at the same time bringing > upon him the fury of the idolaters, who beat him cruelly and drove him from > the city. He was found half-dead on the seashore, and kept in concealment by > the Christians, but was captured again and compelled to walk on burning > coals and a second time expelled. But he remained in the vicinity, and > continued his work of evangelization. We find him then journeying in the > Roman province of Aemilia [in Italy]. A third time he returned to Ravenna. > Again he was captured, hacked with knives, had scalding water poured over > his wounds, was beaten in the mouth with stones because he persisted in > preaching, and was flung into a horrible dungeon, loaded with chains, to > starve to death; but after four days he was put on board a ship and sent to > Greece. There the same course of preachings, miracles and sufferings > continued; and when his very presence caused the oracles to be silent, he > was, after a cruel beating, sent back to Italy. All this continued for three > years, and a fourth time he returned to Ravenna. By this time Vespasian was > Emperor, and he, in answer to the complaints of the pagans, issued a decree > of banishment against the Christians.

However, Christian inscriptions dating from the 2nd century have been discovered near Classe, confirming the presence of Christianity in Ravenna at a very early date. According to the list of the bishops of Ravenna compiled by Bishop Marianus (546-556), the 12th Bishop of Ravenna was named Severus; and he is among those who signed at the Council of Sardica in 343. Thus, the epoch of Saint Apollinaris may be estimated as possibly to the last decades of the 2nd century, placing his martyrdom possibly under Emperor Septimius Severus. Veneration A noted miracle worker, Saint Apollinaris is considered especially effective against gout, venereal diseasehttps://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1486, and epilepsy. His relics are at the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo (which housed his relics from the 9th century until the 1748 reconsecration of Sant'Apollinare in Classe) and the 6th century Benedictine Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe (on the traditional site of his martyrdom), both in Ravenna and in Saint Lambert's church, D√ºsseldorf, Germany. There are also churches dedicated to him in Aachen, Burtscheid and Remagen in Germany, where his veneration was probably spread by Benedictine monks. The Frankish king Clovis built a church dedicated to him in Dijon, and another dedicated to Saint Apollinaris also existed in Bologna, but was destroyed in 1250. Bo≈ôivoj II, Duke of Bohemia, founded a church with a collegiate chapter dedicated to Saint Apollinaris in Sadsk√° (then an important centre of the Czech state) in 1117/1118. On behalf of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, the chapter was later transferred from Sadsk√° to recently founded New Town of Prague in 1362 and another church of St Apollinaris built there. Both of these churches in Bohemia stand to the present time. In 1957, a church venerating St. Apollinaris was founded in Napa, California. In the Tridentine Calendar his feast day is July 23, his birthday into Heaven (i.e., the day of his martyrdom). The present General Roman Calendar devotes this day to Saint Bridget of Sweden, since it is also her birthday to Heaven and she is now better known in the West than Saint Apollinaris, being one of the patron saints of Europe. Owing to the limited importance of Saint Apollinaris' feast worldwide, his liturgical celebration was in 1969 removed from the General Roman Calendar, but not from the Roman Martyrology, the official list of saints.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 131 His memorial was restored to the General Roman Calendar in the 2002 edition of the Roman Missal, with the date of celebration changed to July 20, the nearest day not taken up with other celebrations. The Roman Martyrology mentions Saint Apollinaris both on July 20 (with the above-quoted text) and also more briefly\\"At Classis, near Ravenna in Flaminia, the martyrdom of Saint Apollinaris, bishop, whose memorial is celebrated on 20 July.\\" on July 23.

Russ Jones (born July 16, 1942 in Ontario) is a Canadian novelist, illustrator, and magazine editor, active in the publishing and entertainment industries over a half-century, best known as the creator of the magazine Creepy for Warren Publishing. As the founding editor of Creepy in 1963, he is notable for a significant milestone in comics history by proving there was a readership eager to read graphic stories in a black-and-white magazine format rather than in a color comic book.Richardson, Peter. \\"Russ Jones, Woody and the Genesis of Creepy\\", Cloud 109 (July 6, 2010). During the mid-1960s, Jones also pioneered the presentation of original comics formatted directly for paperback books, such as Christopher Lee's Treasury of Terror (Pyramid, 1966).Kaye, Edward. \\"The A-Z of Canadian Comic Book Creators: J is for Russ Jones\\".  Comics and graphic novels  While in the Marine Corps, Jones worked on Leatherneck magazine. Arriving in New York, he teamed with Wally Wood and Joe Orlando on several comics-related projects, some for Warren Publishing. Jones drew and scripted comic book stories for a variety of publishers, including Marvel, Seaboard, Gold Key, and Charlton. He penciled DC Comics' Mystery in Space, and his slick brush inking provided a polish to many DC romance comics, some inked in collaboration with Bhob Stewart. Jones and Stewart also teamed on scripts and art for Charlton Comics' Ghostly Tales. Jones teamed with penciler Jay Scott Pike as inker on DC's Heart Throbs for the long-running feature \\"3 Girls‚ÄîTheir Lives‚ÄîTheir Loves,\\" which ran from 1966‚Äì1970. Russ Jones Productions' Dracula (Ballantine Books, 1966) was an adaptation of Bram Stoker's tale into a graphic novel illustrated by Alden McWilliams with text by Otto Binder and Craig Tennis. In addition to other story adaptations for Jones, Tennis later wrote the book Johnny Tonight about his experiences as a talent coordinator working with Johnny Carson and The Tonight Show. Magazines In the years following Creepy, Jones founded and edited several other popular culture magazines, including Monster Mania. His magazine Flashback, co-edited with Stewart, employed an unusual approach to the coverage of Hollywood's past by devoting an entire issue to the films of a specific year. A series of front covers by Jack Davis caricatured famed scenes from classic cinema. Humphrey Bogart cradling Woody Woodpecker, rather than the falcon statue of The Maltese Falcon, was the Davis cover for the issue on the films of 1941. Novels Jones wrote more than two dozen paperback novels under the name Jack Younger and other pseudonyms. Devlin (Manor Books, 1976), with Kennedy-like characters, carries the blurb, \\"They were the most powerful family on Earth--but was that power spawned in hell?\\" Younger also is the byline on Maniac! (Manor, 1977), Demon (Carlyle, 1979) and Claw (Manor, 1976), a tale of vicious cats, as noted in the back cover blurb: :Beware the cats! :From out of nowhere, thousands of cats swarmed through the remote summer resort. They were considered only a nuisance at first-until they suddenly went crazy. In the beginning, they preyed on only the young, the aged, the helpless. But as their numbers grew, they began attacking anyone-anywhere- without fear. They kept on coming, relishing the taste of human blood. The town was surrounded; isolated from the mainland. Those who had survived the deadly onslaught huddled together for protection-waiting for help... waiting for an answer... waiting... if only for death...Jones, Russ. Claw. Manor Books, 1976. His work as an illustrator was displayed on front and back covers for Castle of Frankenstein and other magazines. His paintings were also seen in the feature film, The Salton Sea (2002).

They are typically very small, about 2 nm in diameter at atmospheric pressure. Electron bubbles in helium At room temperature, electrons in noble gasses move about freely, limited only by collisions with the weakly interacting atoms. Their mobility, which depends on the gas density and temperature, is well described by classical kinetic theory. As the temperature is lowered the electron mobility decreases, since the helium atoms slow down at lower temperature and do not interact with the electron as often[1]. Below a critical temperature, the mobility of the electrons drops quickly to a value much below what is expected classically. This discrepancy led to the development of the electron bubble theory[2]. At low temperatures, electrons injected into liquid helium do not move freely as one might expect, but rather form small vacuum bubbles around themselves. Electron repulsion from the surface of helium Electrons are attracted to liquid helium due to the difference in dielectric constants between the gas and liquid phase of helium. The negative electron polarizes the helium at the surface, leading to an image charge which binds it to the surface. The electron is forbidden from entering the liquid for the same reason hydrogen atoms are stable: quantum mechanics. The electron and image charge form a bound state, just as an electron and proton do in a hydrogen atom, with a minimum average separation. In this case, the minimum energy is about 1 eV (a moderate amount of energy on an atomic scale)[3]. When an electron is forced into liquid helium rather than floating on its surface, it forms a bubble rather than entering the liquid. The size of this bubble is determined by three main factors (ignoring small corrections): the confinement term, the surface tension term, and the pressure-volume term. The confinement term is purely quantum mechanical, since whenever an electron is tightly confined, its kinetic energy goes up. The surface tension term represents the surface energy of the liquid helium; this is exactly like water and all other liquids. The pressure-volume term is the amount of energy needed to push the helium out of the bubble[4]. E \\\\approx \\\\frac{h^2}{8 m R^2} + 4\\\\pi R^2\\\\alpha + \\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi R^3P Here E is the energy of the bubble, h is Planck's constant, m is the electron mass, R is the bubble radius, Œ± is the surface energy, and P is the ambient pressure. The 2S electron bubble A theoretical prediction has been made based on the analysis of the equation above [5], that the 2S electron bubble exhibits a startling morphological instability under a wide range of ambient pressures. While its wave function is spherical, the stable shape of the bubble is nonspherical. Footnotes *1. *2. *3. *4. *5.

It uses two approximations: *core approximation - only the outer valence electrons are explicitly included. *zero-differential overlap CNDO/2 is the main version of CNDO. The method was first introduced by John Pople and coworkers.J. Pople and D. Beveridge, Approximate Molecular Orbital Theory, McGraw-Hill, 1970. J. A. Pople, D. P. Santry and G. A. Segal, Journal of Chemical Physics, 43, S129, (1965)J. A. Pople and G. A. Segal, Journal of Chemical Physics, 43, S136, (1965)J. Pople and G.A. Segal, Journal of Chemical Physics, 44, 3289 (1966)D.P. Santry and G.A. Segal, Journal of Chemical Physics, 47, 158 (1967) Background An earlier method was Extended H√ºckel method, which explicitly ignores electron-electron repulsion terms. It was a method for calculating the electronic energy and the molecular orbitals. CNDO/1 and CNDO/2 were developed from this method by explicitly including the electron-electron repulsion terms, but neglecting many of them, approximating some of them and fitting others to experimental data from spectroscopy. Methodology Quantum mechanics provides equations based on the Hartree‚ÄìFock method and the Roothaan equations that CNDO uses to model atoms and their locations. These equations are solved iteratively to the point where the results do not vary significantly between two iterations. CNDO does not involve knowledge about chemical bonds but instead uses knowledge about quantum wavefunctions. CNDO can be used for both closed shell molecules, where the electrons are fully paired in molecular orbitals and open shell molecules, which are radicals with unpaired electrons. It is also used in solid state and nanostructures calculations.Mudar A. Abdulsattar, ‚ÄòSize effects of semiempirical large unit cell method in comparison with nanoclusters properties of diamond-structured covalent semiconductors‚Äô, Physica E 41, 1679 (2009). CNDO is considered to yield good results for partial atomic charges and molecular dipole moment. Total energy and binding energy are calculated. Eigenvalues for calculating the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital are reported from the closed shell approach.

It commemorates the unification of Eastern Rumelia and Bulgaria in 1885. By the terms of the Treaty of Berlin (1878), Southern Bulgaria (named Eastern Roumelia) was separated from the newly formed Bulgarian state and returned to the Ottoman Empire with partial autonomy. Bulgarian citizens considered the decisions of the Berlin Treaty to be unfair and began a peaceful demonstration against them. At first the plan was to annex all territories that Bulgaria had gained after the Treaty of San Stefano but later it became clear that was impossible because of the unsuitable international situation. The Bulgarians had to leave Macedonia and the rest of Thrace and concentrate on the East Roumelian issue. The first actions were taken in 1880 but the sharpened political situation, economic instability and the low prestige of the Bulgarian country delayed the resolution of the so-called \\"national question\\". In 1884 the \\"Macedonian committees\\" were the main body working on the unsolved problem. On 10 February 1885 led by Zahari Stoyanov a group of former revolutionaries founded in Plovdiv (the capital of Eastern Roumelia) a secret committee known as BSCRC ‚Äì Bulgarian Secret Central Revolutionary Committee (). It had regulations and programs which were connected to the organisation led by Vasil Levski, Hristo Botev and Lyuben Karavelov before the Liberation. After a few months BSCRC had improved their plan for actions and organised some public events on dates significant to Bulgarians. The conference in Dermendare (Parvanets) on 24‚Äì26 July and the next meeting on 23 August declared what should be done and exactly how to proceed. On 5 September 1885 the people rose in Goliamo Konare (Saedinenie) and after arresting the prefect of Plovdiv the militia advanced toward the capital. On 6 September the palace in Plovdiv was surrounded. The governor Gavril Krastevich did not alert the Turks in Istanbul and proclaimed his support of the people's cause. A temporary government headed by Georgi Stranski took control of the situation and armed forces were commanded by major Danail Nikolaev who began preparation for war with the Ottoman Empire. On 8 September knyaz Alexander received a telegram in the old capital Tarnovo which he was already expecting. His army was prepared and waiting for a signal. He agreed to become a leader of the Unified Bulgaria. On the next day (9 September) the knyaz arrived in Plovdiv and the temporary government was dismissed. Diplomatic efforts failed and Bulgaria had to defend its interests on the battlefield in the Serbo-Bulgarian War where the Bulgarians were victorious.

The apse is lavishly decorated with mosaics, such as the Crux Gemmata Mosaic panel of Constantine IV granting privilege to the Ravennate church. An image from the nave. The Basilica of Sant' Apollinare in Classe (\\"Saint Apollinaris in Classe\\") is a church in Ravenna, Italy, consecrated on 9 May 549 by the bishop Maximian and dedicated to Saint Apollinaris, the first bishop of Ravenna and Classe. An important monument of Byzantine art, in 1996 it was inscribed with seven other nearby monuments in the UNESCO World Heritage List, which described it as \\"an outstanding example of the early Christian basilica in its purity and simplicity of its design and use of space and in the sumptuous nature of its decoration\\". History Work on Sant'Apollinare in Classe started at the beginning of 6th century by order of Bishop Ursicinus, using money from the Greek banker Iulianus Argentarius. It was certainly located next to a Christian cemetery, and quite possibly on top of a pre-existing pagan one, as some of the ancient tombstones were re- used in its construction. At that time Classes was located on the shore and was the ancient home port of the Roman fleet which gave its name to the town. Due to the accumulation of silt, the coastline has since moved to the east.Deliyannis, Mauskopf, Deborah. Ravenna in Late Antiquity. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, January 2010, p. 13 The imposing brick structure was consecrated on 9 May 549 by Bishop Maximian and dedicated to Saint Apollinaris. The Basilica is thus contemporary with the Basilica of San Vitale of Ravenna. In 856, the relics of Saint Apollinaris were transferred from the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe to the Basilica of Sant' Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna. Architecture =Exterior= The exterior has a large fa√ßade with two simple uprights and one mullioned window with three openings. The narthex and building to the right of the entry are later additions, as is the fine 9th century round bell tower with mullioned windows. =Interior= The church has a central nave with two side aisles, a standard basilica design. An ancient altar in the mid of the nave covers the place of the saint's martyrdom. The church ends with a polygonal apse, sided by two chapels with apses. The nave contains 24 columns of Greek marble. The carved capitals of the columns depict acanthus leaves, but unlike most such carvings the leaves appear twisted as if being buffeted by the wind. The faded frescos depict some of the archbishops of Ravenna, and date to the 18th century. The lateral walls are bare, but were certainly once covered with gorgeous mosaics. These were likely demolished by the Venetians in 1449, although they left the mosaic decoration in the apse and on the triumphal arch, the church's most striking features. The upper section of the triumphal arch depicts, inside a medallion, Christ. At the sides, within a sea of clouds, are the winged symbols of the four Evangelists: the Eagle (John), the Winged Man (Matthew), the Lion (Mark), the Calf (Luke). The lower section has, at its two edges, the walls showing precious gems from which twelve lambs (symbols of the Twelve Apostles) exit. The sides of the arch show two palms which, in the Bible's symbolism, represent justice; under them are the archangels Michael and Gabriel, with the bust of St. Matthew and another unidentified saint. The decoration of the apse date to the 6th century, and can be divided into two parts: *in the upper one, a large disc encloses a starry sky in which is a cross with gems and the face of Christ. Over the cross is a hand protruding from the clouds, the theme of the Hand of God. At the side of the disc are the figures of Elijah and Moses. The three lambs in the lower sector symbolize the saints Peter, James and John, alluding the Transfiguration of Jesus on Mount Tabor. *in the lower one is a green valley with rocks, bush, plants and birds. In the middle is the figure of Saint Apollinaris, portrayed in the act of praying God to give grace to his faithful, symbolized by twelve white lambs. In the spaces between the windows are the four bishops who founded the main basilicas in Ravenna: Ursicinus, Ursus, Severus and Ecclesius, all with a book in a hand. At the sides of the apse are two 7th-century panels: the left one, which has largely been restored, portrays the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IVAgenellus of Ravenna, Deborah Mauskopf Deliyannis (trans.), The Book of Pontiffs of the Church of Ravenna (Washington D.C., 2004), p. 234, f.n. 4 granting privileges to an envoy of the Ravenna's archbishop. In the right panel are Abraham, Abel and Melchisedek around an altar, on which they offer a sacrifice to God. The choice of the subject is closely linked to the fight against Arianism, as it restates the both divine and human nature of Christ, the former negated by the Arians. In addition, the representation of Apollinaris among the apostles was a legitimation to Maximian as the first bishop of a diocese directly related to the early followers of Jesus, being Apollinaris, according to the legend, a disciple of St. Peter. The Basilica's walls are lined by numerous sarcophagi from different centuries. They attest the changes of style from the 5th to the 8th centuries: from reliefs with human figures of the Roman sarcophagi, to Byzantine symbolism, to the increasing abstraction and simplification of these symbologies.

Cannon Spike is noted as the last game released for Dreamcast in Europe, published by Bigben Interactive and exclusively sold at retail in Game outlets. The international name of Cannon Spike is the name of a trademark attack performed by Cammy, a character from the Street Fighter series of video games and one of the protagonists of this title. Characters The game's playable characters, which come from a range of Capcom games, include: *Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins *Baby Bonnie Hood (or Bulleta in Japan) from Darkstalkers (hidden character) *Cammy from the Street Fighter II series *Charlie (or Nash in Japan) from the Street Fighter Alpha series *Mega Man (or Rockman in Japan) from the Mega Man series (hidden character) *Shiba Shintaro from Three Wonders One other character, Simone, was made specifically for the game and has not been featured in any game since. Simone shares a few similarities with another Capcom character, Linn Kurosawa, from Alien vs. Predator. Vega appears as an enemy character, named Fallen Balrog or Revenger Balrog in all regions. Gameplay In its arcade incarnation, the game is played using a joystick and three buttons; Mark (used to lock onto a targeted enemy), Shoot, and Attack (a close-range strike, usually more powerful or with greater knock-back compared to ordinary shooting.) In addition to these basic commands, each character also has a ranged special attack (unleashed by pressing Shoot and Attack simultaneously), a close-range special (Mark and Attack simultaneously), and a super special (all three buttons simultaneously). The use of the super special requires a Special Token, occasionally dropped by a defeated enemy and always dropped by a defeated ally in 2-player mode. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Cannon Spike on their November 15, 2000 issue as being the second most-successful arcade game of the year. Greg Orlando reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Cannon Spike is not quite artillerific, but it is a mindlessly fun way to murder some time.\\" The Dreamcast version received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

He was badly wounded during the Polish campaign during the first month of World War II in Europe. After recovering, from 1940 to April 1945, he served in the F√ºhrerbegleitkommando (F√ºhrer Escort Command; FBK) as a bodyguard, courier, and telephone operator for German dictator Adolf Hitler. He was widely reported in the media as being the last surviving occupant of the F√ºhrerbunker when he died in September 2013. Early life and education Misch was born on 29 July 1917 in Alt-Schalkowitz near Oppeln (Opole) in the Province of Silesia (now Stare Sio≈Çkowice, Poland). His father, a construction worker, died of wounds sustained in World War I. His widowed mother died of pneumonia when he was two and a half, and he grew up with his grandparents. His older brother Bruno died following a swimming accident in 1922. Over the objections of the school director, his grandfather took him out of school after eight years as he thought Rochus needed to learn a trade. After several years, Misch moved to Hoyerswerda and became an apprentice with the firm of Schm√ºller & Model. There he trained as a painter. In 1935, after working as a journeyman painter, Misch attended the Masters' School for Fine Arts in Cologne. After six months, he returned to Hoyerswerda to continue his training. Misch met Gerda, his wife-to-be, in July 1938. They later married on New Year's Eve, 1942. They had a daughter, Brigitta Jacob-Engelken who after the end of World War II, supported Jewish causes. Military service In 1937, Misch received a call-up notice for military service. In Offenberg, he joined the SS-Verf√ºgungstruppe (SS-VT), the predecessor to the Waffen-SS, instead of the German Army as the SS-VT did not require Reichsarbeitsdienst (National Labour Service) time. Along with eleven others, he was selected for Hitler's personal bodyguard unit, the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). In August 1939, he was promoted to the rank of SS-Rottenf√ºhrer. =World War II= For the invasion of Poland in September 1939, his regiment was attached to the XIII Army Corps, a part of the 8th Army. Near Warsaw on 24 September, he was one of four men selected by his company commander, then SS- Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Wilhelm Mohnke to negotiate the surrender of Polish troops during the Battle of Modlin. He was picked because of his ability, although very limited, to speak Polish. After the negotiations failed, the Germans headed back to their lines. When they were about 80 metres from the fort, firing began. Several rounds struck Misch, who fell down and lost consciousness. Some German soldiers carried him to an aid station. Later, he was transferred to two different hospitals. Thereafter, he spent six weeks at a convalescent home. For his actions, Misch was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class. As Misch was the last living member of his Lower Silesian family, Mohnke recommended him for the SS-Begleitkommando des F√ºhrers (F√ºhrer Escort Command; FBK). This was made up of SS members, including men from the LSSAH, who were not serving on the front lines. Misch was transferred to the FBK in early May 1940. As a junior member of Hitler's permanent bodyguard, Misch travelled with Hitler throughout the war. When not serving as bodyguards, Misch and the others in the unit served as telephone operators, couriers, orderlies, valets, and waiters. When on duty, the FBK members were the only armed men Hitler allowed to be near him. They never had to surrender their weapon and were never searched when they were with Hitler. It did cause Misch some concern that they were armed only with Walther PPK 7.65 pistols. On 16 January 1945, following the Wehrmacht's defeat in the Battle of the Bulge, Misch and the rest of Hitler's personal staff moved into the F√ºhrerbunker and Vorbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin. His FBK commanding officer, Franz Sch√§dle, appointed Misch to be the bunker telephone operator. Misch handled all of the direct communication from the bunker. He did not leave it for any significant period of time until the war ended in May 1945. On 22 April 1945, Sch√§dle called him on the phone and told him there was a place reserved for his wife and young daughter on one of the last planes out of Berlin. Misch was temporarily released from duty and drove to pick up his family to take them to the aircraft. However, his wife refused to take their daughter and leave him and her parents in Berlin. Upon returning to the Reich Chancellery, Misch learned that Hitler was releasing most of the remaining staff to leave Berlin. By that date, as the Red Army was entering Berlin, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda brought their six young children to stay in the Vorbunker. Joseph Goebbels moved into the room next to Misch's telephone exchange in the lower level of the F√ºhrerbunker. The Goebbels children would play in the corridor around Misch's post. On 30 April, the Soviets were less than from the bunker. That afternoon, Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide fewer than 40 hours after they were married. Misch witnessed the discovery of the bodies of Hitler and Braun. He followed Otto G√ºnsche and Hitler's chief valet Heinz Linge to the door of Hitler's private room. After the door was opened, Misch only took a quick \\"glance\\". He saw Eva, with her legs drawn up, to Hitler's left on the sofa. Her eyes were open and she was dead. Hitler was also dead. He was either sitting on the sofa or in the armchair by it; his head \\"had fallen forward slightly\\". Misch started to leave to report the events to Sch√§dle, but then stopped and returned to the door of Hitler's study. Misch observed that Hitler's corpse had been removed from inside the study and wrapped in a blanket. Several men then picked it up and carried it past him. Misch left and reported the events to Sch√§dle, who instructed him to return to his duty station. After returning to the telephone exchange, Misch later recalled Unterscharf√ºhrer Retzbach proclaiming \\"So they're burning the boss now!\\" Retzbach asked Misch if he was going upstairs to watch the events, but Misch declined to go. Thereafter, G√ºnsche came down and told Misch that the corpses of Hitler and Braun had been burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery. Misch was present in the bunker complex when Magda Goebbels poisoned her six children and then committed suicide with her husband Joseph on 1 May 1945. According to Misch, this act by the Goebbels' of murdering their children was most unsettling. Years later he stated that event was the \\"most dreadful thing\\" he experienced in the bunker. Prior to his suicide, Joseph Goebbels finally released Misch from further service; he was free to leave. Misch and mechanic Johannes Hentschel were two of the last people remaining in the bunker. They exchanged letters to their wives in case anything happened to either of them. Misch then went upstairs through the cellars of the Reich Chancellery to where Sch√§dle had his office to report one last time. According to Hentschel, by that time Sch√§dle's shrapnel leg wound had turned gangrenous. Misch told Sch√§dle that Goebbels had released him. Sch√§dle told Misch what route he should take in order to avoid the Soviet encirclement of the Berlin area. Thereafter, Sch√§dle shot himself. Misch fled the bunker in the early morning of 2 May, only hours before the Red Army seized it. He met up with some other soldiers and they travelled north through the U-Bahn tunnels. Shortly thereafter, they were taken prisoner by Red Army soldiers. Misch was brought to Lubyanka Prison in Moscow, where he was tortured by Soviet NKVD officers in an attempt to extract information regarding Hitler's last days. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was extremely interested in learning of Hitler's fate and theories about possible escape. Misch spent eight years in Soviet forced labour camps. Later life and death After his release from captivity in 1953, Misch returned to what was then West Berlin. He arrived home on 31 December to the house which was from the F√ºhrerbunker. At the time, Misch's wife Gerda worked as a teacher in Neuk√∂lln. Misch struggled for several years with what to do with his life after captivity. He was offered various odd jobs, among others as a porter in a hospital and as a driver. Most of these job offers were through his wartime contacts, and required moving away from Berlin, which his wife refused to do. He finally obtained a loan backed by wealthy German philanthropists to buy out a painting and interior decorating shop from a retiree in Berlin. He ran this modest business successfully, and during the early Allied occupation of Berlin also became involved in the making of peanut butter for US soldiers. The business had been started by Misch's old friend, Adolf Kleinholdermann. This sideline business became so successful that Misch considered leaving his shop. His wife Gerda convinced him to remain in the painting and interior decorating business. In 1975, Gerda was elected to the parliament of West Berlin in which she served for several years. Years later, Gerda developed Alzheimer's and died in 1998. Misch continued to manage his shop until his retirement at age 68 in 1985. Misch was loyal to Hitler to the end of his life, stating in Nazi apologia, \\"He was no brute. He was no monster. He was no superman\\", \\"...very normal. Not like what is written\\", and \\"[h]e was a wonderful boss\\". Misch's daughter, Brigitta, learned through her maternal grandmother that Gerda was of Jewish descent. However, Gerda never mentioned it and her father refused to acknowledge it. Brigitta became an architect and has supported Jewish causes. Brigitta stated that she was disappointed by her father's lack of remorse after the war. After the release of the 2004 German film Downfall (Der Untergang) in France, French journalist Nicolas Bourcier interviewed Misch on multiple occasions during 2005. The resulting biography was published in French as J'√©tais garde du corps d'Hitler 1940‚Äì1945 (I was Hitler's bodyguard 1940‚Äì1945) in March 2006, . Translations were released in South America, Japan, Spain, Poland, Turkey, and Germany in 2006 and 2007. Misch served as consultant to writer Christopher McQuarrie on the 2008 film Valkyrie, a Hollywood depiction of the 20 July plot. In a 2005 interview, Misch called Downfall \\"Americanized\\" while comparing what happened in the film to what happened in real life, stating that although it portrayed the important facts accurately, it exaggerated other details for dramatic effect, such as the film's characters screaming and shouting when in his recollection most people in the bunker spoke quietly. In the interview he also expressed some skepticism regarding Hitler's role in Nazi atrocities, stating that \\"Neo- Nazis\\" did not exist but were rather just patriotic people who cared about their countries' well-being, and that the US invaded Iraq in 2003 to enrich Israel. After listening to an 11-minute recording of Hitler in private conversation with Finnish Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, Misch opined: With the deaths of Bernd von Freytag-Loringhoven on 27 February 2007, Armin Lehmann on 10 October 2008, and Siegfried Knappe on 1 December 2008, Misch was said to be the last survivor of the F√ºhrerbunker. His memoir in German, Der letzte Zeuge (\\"The Last Witness\\"), was published in 2008. The English edition was published in 2014 with an introduction by historian Roger Moorhouse. Misch lived in Berlin in the same house he moved into when he was released by the Soviets. The house is in the district of Rudow in South Berlin. Misch regularly received visitors who wished to speak to or interview him. Misch died in Berlin on 5 September 2013 at the age of 96.

He was the son of Minamoto no Mitsunaka (912‚Äì997). Along with his brother Yorimitsu, Yorinobu served the regents of the Fujiwara clan, taking the violent measures the Fujiwara were themselves unable to take. He held the title, passed down from his father, of Chinjufu-sh≈çgun, Commander-in- chief of the Defense of the North. He served as Governor of the Japanese Ise, Shinano, Sagami, Mutsu and Kai Provinces, and was the progenitor of the Kawachi Genji family line and his son, Minamoto no Yorisue, was ancestor of the Takanashi clan of Shinano Province. Yorinobu is particularly known for being a favorite of the Regent Fujiwara no Michinaga, and for suppressing a revolt by Taira no Tadatsune, vice-governor of Kazusa Province. He had originally refused, for personal reasons, but eventually assented to taking on the charge of defeating Tadatsune, after being made Governor of Kai. While making preparations to attack, Tadatsune surrendered, offering no resistance in 1031. In putting an end to this rebellion, Yorinobu not only furthered the Court's goals and his own reputation, but he created an opening for Minamoto influence in the eastern portions of the country.

He was also known as Royal A. Blandin. Early life and stage career Fielding was born in Riceville, Iowa, the son of Chester John Blandin and Almeda Bacon. He was raised by his grandparents. Although without medical training, at one time he ran a medical practice in Kansas City, Missouri. He prospected for gold in Alaska, where he made friends with Jack London and Rex Beach, both of whom would influence his work in films. He also worked as a travel agent, machinist and railway engineer before becoming an actor under the name of Romaine Fielding. Prior to 1908, Fielding acted in stock theater with the Morosco company in San Francisco and the Castle Square company in Boston. Film career Fielding worked for the Solax Film Company of New York before joining Philadelphia-based Lubin Studios in November 1911 at the age of 44. Despite his age, he could easily portray much younger characters. In June 1912 Siegmund Lubin placed Fielding in charge of the Lubin Southwest Company as director, despite the fact that until then he had only acted. It was the start of a rapid rise to fame. Fielding would write and direct films as well as star in them. He broke with convention, challenging stereotypical casting of Indians and Mexicans as villains. His films often ended unexpectedly on a downbeat note. His work was praised in the trade press for its visual beauty combined with realism. Fielding directed films in the old streets of Tucson in 1912, then moved north to Prescott to film stories based on old west mining and Indian life. He used many local people as extras. Towards the end of 1912 he moved his company down to Nogales. In March 1913 he crossed into Mexico with his company, and was able to film the Battle of Nogales as it happened. He later directed and filmed additional battle scenes, then spliced the real and artificial footage to give the sense of the battle having been filmed from both sides. From there he took his company to Silver City, New Mexico, where he rented two houses and built an outdoor stage for shooting interior scenes. He made use of abandoned structures to film spectacular fires or explosions, which formed the highlights of his fresh and realistic films, typically dark human tragedies. Fielding rented the entire Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas, New Mexico from 1913 to 1915, and renamed it the Hotel Romaine. It is still possible to see traces of that name on the brick facade. The first film that Fielding made in Las Vegas was The Rattlesnake, a story about two rivals in love. Four more shorts were made within the next month. His five-reel thriller The Golden God employed about 5,000 local extras and featured a cavalry and artillery charge through the streets of the old town. The print for the film was lost in a fire, and there are no surviving copies. At one time he filmed a train smash at great expense. Lubin used the costly footage in five different films. Fielding made a number of Mexican- themed western-style films and adventure films on location in California, Arizona, and New Mexico, but little of his work has survived. In July 1913 Motion Picture Story magazine announced that Fielding had come top of their readers poll with 1,311,018 votes. In 1915, Fielding built a moveable power plant to enable the Lubin company to make films at night. The four-ton unit included a generator, a 2,000-foot cable, a 13-inch searchlight, and other lights. =Military service and post-war career= Fielding's career was interrupted by his military service during World War I, when he served as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army's Intelligence Department. Following the war, during the early 1920s, he organized the General Film Manufacturing Corporation in St. Louis, Missouri. Missouri's State Finance Department revoked the company's permit to sell stock in 1924, charging that the business had \\"degenerated into a mere stock-seling proposition.\\" Fielding disputed the charge. Although the company had made some films, they achieved little success. Fielding returned to Hollywood following the filing of a petition of receivership and a suit by two employees for back wages. Personal life After having married Icylene L. Richards in the 1890s, he married Mabel van Valkenburg in 1907 but divorced 10 years later. He worked and acted in live theatre for a number of years. His third marriage, in 1918, was to actress Joan Arliss (real name: Naomi Sachs), with whom he remained until his death; the union producing three children. Following the demise of Lubin Studios in 1917, Romaine Fielding was out of filmmaking until 1920 after which he continued to work in film until his death in Hollywood at age 60 from a blood clot. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

The Australian debate often concerns the extent to which the history of European colonisation post-1788 and government administration since Federation in 1901 may be characterised as having been: *a relatively minor conflict between European colonists and Indigenous Australians, and generally lacking in events that might be termed \\"invasion\\", \\"warfare\\", \\"guerrilla warfare\\", \\"conquest\\" or \\"genocide\\", and generally marked instead by humane intent by government authorities, with damage to Indigenous peoples largely attributable to unintended factors (such as the spread of new diseases) rather than to malicious policies; or *an invasion marked by violent conflict at the frontier, guerrilla warfare (or other forms of warfare) between Europeans and Aboriginal people, involving frequent or significant massacres of Aboriginal peoples engaged in defending their traditional tribal lands; a situation which can be said to have developed either nationally, or in certain areas, into something like a war of \\"extermination\\" or something which accords with the term genocide as a consequence of British imperialism and colonialism involving continued dispossession, exploitation, ill-treatment and cultural genocide. The history wars also relates to broader themes concerning national identity, as well as methodological questions concerning the historian and the craft of researching and writing history, including issues such as the value and reliability of written records (of the authorities and settlers) and the oral tradition (of the Indigenous Australians), along with the political or similar ideological biases of those who interpret them. One theme is how British or multicultural Australian identity has been in history and today.Neville Meaney, \\"Britishness and Australian identity: The problem of nationalism in Australian history and historiography\\", Australian Historical Studies 32.116 (2001): 76‚Äì90.Deborah Gare, \\"Britishness in recent Australian historiography\\". Historical Journal 43#4 (2000): 1145‚Äì1155. At the same time the history wars were in play, professional history seemed in decline, and popular writers began reclaiming the field. Outline The term \\"history wars\\" refers to an ideological conflict over how to perceive Australia as a nation, framed largely by the respective visions of Labor Party Prime Minister Paul Keating (1991‚Äì1996), who saw race relations as central to the nation's character and who gave new attention to Indigenous people's issues, and Liberal Prime Minister John Howard (1996‚Äì2007), who sought to re-establish a conservative view of Australia that valorised the nation's achievements and was grounded in ‚ÄúJudeo-Christian ethics, the progressive spirit of the enlightenment and the institutions and values of British culture\\". The conflict was played out largely in the popular media, books, and think-tank lectures. Commentators on the political left argued that Australia's national identity was linked to its treatment of Indigenous people and advocated making amends for past injustices on moral grounds, while those on the political right argued that the left had exaggerated the harms done to Indigenous Australians, that stories of abuses of Indigenous people were undermining Australia's coherent identity, and that contemporary Australians did not feel responsible for abuses committed in the past. Much of the public controversy was related to the release of the government's report on the Stolen Generations commissioned by Keating but released after Howard took office, titled Bringing Them Home. In 1968 Professor W. E. H. \\"Bill\\" Stanner, an Australian anthropologist, coined the term the \\"Great Australian Silence\\" in a Boyer Lecture titled \\"After the Dreaming\\",Stanner pp. 198‚Äì248 where he argued that the writing of Australian history was incomplete. He asserted that Australian national history as documented up to that point had largely been presented in a positive light, but that Indigenous Australians had been virtually ignored. He saw this as a structural and deliberate process to omit \\"several hundred thousand Aboriginal people who lived and died between 1788 and 1938 ... (who were but) ... negative facts of history and ... were in no way consequential for the modern period\\".Stanner, p. 214. A new strand of Australian historiography subsequently emerged which gave much greater attention to the negative experiences of Indigenous Australians during the British settlement of Australia.In the 1970s and 1980s, historians such as Manning Clark and Henry Reynolds published work which they saw as correcting selective historiography that had misrepresented or ignored Indigenous Australian history. The historian Geoffrey Blainey argued in the literary and political journal Quadrant in 1993 that the telling of Australian history had moved from an unduly positive rendition (the \\"Three Cheers View\\") to an unduly negative view (The \\"'black armband'\\") and Australian commentators and politicians have continued to debate this subject. Interpretations of Aboriginal history became part of the wider political debate sometimes called the culture wars during the tenure of the Coalition government from 1996‚Äì2007, with Prime Minister of Australia John Howard publicly championing the views of some of those associated' with Quadrant.Robert Manne (November 2008), \\"What is Rudd's Agenda?\\", The Monthly. This debate extended into a controversy over the way history was presented in the National Museum of Australia and in high school history curricula. It also migrated into the general Australian media, with regular opinion pieces being published in major broadsheets such as The Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. Marcia Langton has referred to much of this wider debate as 'war porn'Baudrillard J. \\"War porn\\". Journal of Visual Culture, Vol. 5, No. 1, 86‚Äì88 (2006) and an 'intellectual dead end'.Langton M. Essay: Trapped in the aboriginal reality show. Griffith Review 2007, 19:Re-imagining Australia. Two Australian prime ministers, Paul Keating and John Howard, were major participants in the \\"wars\\". According to the analysis for the Australian Parliamentary Library of Dr Mark McKenna, Howard believed that Keating portrayed Australia pre-Whitlam in an unduly negative light; while Keating sought to distance the modern Labor movement from its historical support for the Monarchy and the White Australia policy by arguing that it was the Conservative Australian Parties who had been barriers to national progress and excessively loyal to the British Empire. He accused Britain of having abandoned Australia during World War II. Keating was a staunch advocate of a symbolic apology to indigenous people for the misdeeds of past governments, and outlined his view of the origins and potential solutions to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage in his Redfern Park Speech (drafted with the assistance of historian Don Watson). In the aftermath of the 1997 Bringing Them Home report and the ensuing debate, which was highly acrimonious, Howard in 1999 passed a Parliamentary Motion of Reconciliation describing treatment of Aboriginal people as the \\"most blemished chapter\\" in Australian history, but he did not make a Parliamentary apology. Howard argued that an apology was inappropriate as it would imply \\"intergeneration guilt\\" and said that \\"practical\\" measures were a better response to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage. Keating has argued for the eradication of remaining symbols linked to British origins: including deference for ANZAC Day, the Australian Flag and the Monarchy in Australia, while Howard was a supporter of these institutions. Unlike fellow Labor leaders and contemporaries, Bob Hawke and Kim Beazley, Keating never traveled to Gallipoli for ANZAC Day ceremonies. In 2008 he described those who gathered there as \\"misguided\\". In 2006, John Howard said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of Quadrant that \\"political correctness\\" was dead in Australia but: \\"we should not underestimate the degree to which the soft-left still holds sway, even dominance, especially in Australia's universities\\"; and in 2006, The Sydney Morning Herald Political Editor Peter Hartcher reported that Opposition foreign affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd was entering the philosophical debate by arguing in response that \\"John Howard, is guilty of perpetrating 'a fraud' in his so-called culture wars ... designed not to make real change but to mask the damage inflicted by the Government's economic policies\\". The defeat of the Howard government in the Australian Federal election of 2007, and its replacement by the Rudd Labor government altered the dynamic of the debate. Rudd made an official apology to the Stolen Generation with bipartisan support. Like Keating, Rudd supported an Australian Republic, but in contrast to Keating, Rudd declared support for the Australian flag and supported the commemoration of ANZAC Day and expressed admiration for Liberal Party founder Robert Menzies. Following the change of government and the passage, with support from all parties, of a Parliamentary apology to indigenous Australians, Professor of Australian Studies Richard Nile argued: \\"the culture and history wars are over and with them should also go the adversarial nature of intellectual debate,\\" a view contested by others, including conservative commentator Janet Albrechtsen. However, an intention to reengage in the history wars was indicated by then-Federal Opposition member Christopher Pyne. Black armband / white blindfold debate The \\"black armband\\" debate concerns whether or not accounts of Australian history gravitate towards an overly negative or an overly positive point of view. The black armband view of history was a phrase first used by Australian historian Geoffrey Blainey in his 1993 Sir John Latham Memorial Lecture to describe views of history which, he believed, posited that \\"much of [pre-multicultural] Australian history had been a disgrace\\" and which focused mainly on the treatment of minority groups (especially Aboriginal people). This he contrasted with the 'Three Cheers' view, according to which: \\"nearly everything that came after [the convict era] was believed to be pretty good\\". Blainey argued that both such accounts of Australian history were inaccurate: \\"The Black Armband view of history might well represent the swing of the pendulum from a position that had been too favourable, too self-congratulatory, to an opposite extreme that is even more unreal and decidedly jaundiced.\\"M. McKenna, (10 November 1997), Research Paper 5 1997‚Äì98: \\"Different Perspectives on Black Armband History, Parliament of Australia, Parliamentary Library \\"To some extent my generation was reared on the Three Cheers view of history. This patriotic view of our past had a long run. It saw Australian history as largely a success. While the convict era was a source of shame or unease, nearly everything that came after was believed to be pretty good. There is a rival view, which I call the Black Armband view of history. In recent years it has assailed the optimistic view of history. The black armbands were quietly worn in official circles in 1988. The multicultural folk busily preached their message that until they arrived much of Australian history was a disgrace. The past treatment of Aboriginal people, of Chinese, of Kanakas, of non-British migrants, of women, the very old, the very young, and the poor was singled out, sometimes legitimately, sometimes not. My friend and undergraduate teacher Manning Clark, who was almost the official historian in 1988, had done much to spread the gloomy view and also the compassionate view with his powerful prose and Old Testament phrases. \\"The Black Armband view of history might well represent the swing of the pendulum from a position that had been too favourable, too self-congratulatory, to an opposite extreme that is even more unreal and decidedly jaundiced.\\" The lecture was subsequently published in the political and literary journal, Quadrant,Geoffrey Blainey, 'Drawing Up a Balance Sheet of Our History', in Quadrant, vol.37 ( 7‚Äì8), July/August 1993 which at the time was edited by academic and political scientist Robert Manne and later by writer and historian Keith Windschuttle, two of the leading \\"history warriors\\", albeit on opposing sides of the debate. The phrase then began to be used by some commentators pejoratively to describe historians viewed as writing excessively critical Australian history \\"while wearing a black armband\\" of \\"mourning and grieving, or shame\\". New interpretations of Australia's history since 1788 were contested for focussing almost exclusively on official and unofficial imperialism, exploitation, ill-treatment, colonial dispossession and cultural genocide and ignoring positive aspects of Australia's history. Historian Manning Clark, author of the best-known history of Australia, was named by Blainey in his 1993 speech as having \\"done much to spread the gloomy view and also the compassionate view with his powerful prose and Old Testament phrases\\". The Howard Government's responses to the question of how to recount Australian history were initially formulated in the context of former Labor prime minister Paul Keating's characterisation of the subject. John Howard argued in a 1996 Sir Robert Menzies Lecture that the \\"balance sheet of Australian history\\" had come to be misrepresented: In 2009, Howard's successor Kevin Rudd also called for moving away from a black-arm view: Stephen Muecke, Professor of Ethnography at the University of New South Wales, contributed to the debate by arguing that black armband events bring people together in common remembrance and cited Anzac Day as an example; while Aboriginal lawyer Noel Pearson argued that whilst there was much that is worth preserving in the cultural heritage of non-Aboriginal Australia, \\"To say that ordinary Australians who are part of the national community today do not have any connection with the shameful aspects of our past is at odds with our exhortations that they have connections to the prideful bits\\". The notion of the white blindfold view of history entered the debate as a pejorative counter-response to the notion of the \\"black armband school\\".Clark, Anna.

Originally published in Richard Nile (ed), Country: Journal of Australian Studies no 75, St Lucia, UQP, 2002. In his book Why Weren't We Told? in 1999, Henry Reynolds referred to Stanner's \\"Great Australian Silence\\", and to \\"a 'mental block' which prevented Australians from coming to terms with the past\\".Reynolds (1999), p. 114. He argued that the silence about Australia's history of frontier violence in much of the twentieth century stands in stark contrast with the openness with which violence was admitted and discussed in the nineteenth. Reynolds quotes many excerpts from the press, including an article in the Townsville Herald in Queensland written as late as 1907, by a \\"pioneer\\" who described his part in a massacre. Reynolds commented that violence against Aboriginals, far from being hushed up or denied, was openly talked about. The nature of the debate began to change in 1999 with the publication of a book Massacre Myth by journalist Rod Moran, who examined the 1926 Forrest River massacre in Western Australia. Moran concluded that the massacre was a myth inspired by the false claims of a missionary (possibly as a result of mental health issues).Moran, Rod (1999) Massacre myth: an investigation into allegations concerning the mass murder of Aboriginal people at Forrest River, 1926 Bassendean, W.A. Access Press. The principal historian of the Forrest River massacre, Neville Green, describes the massacre as probable but not able to be proven in court.Green, Neville: \\"The evidence for The Forrest River Massacre\\". Quadrant, 1 July 2003 Windschuttle said that reviewing Moran's book inspired his own examination of the wider historical record. Windschuttle argues that much of Australian Aboriginal history, particularly as written since the late 1970s, was based on the use of questionable or unreliable evidence and on deliberate misrepresentation and fabrication of historical evidence. He based his conclusions on his examination of the evidence cited in previous historical accounts and reported incidences of non-existent documents being cited, misquoting and misleadingly selective quoting from documents and of documents being cited as evidence that certain events took place when his examination concluded that they do not support those claims. Windschuttle reported his conclusions in a number of articles published in Quadrant and in 2002, he published a book, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume 1, Van Diemen's Land 1803‚Äì1847, which focussed on Tasmanian colonial history. Blainey argued in a 2003 book review of Fabrication, that the number of instances where source documents do not support the claims made, and the fact that the divergences overwhelmingly tend to purport claims of violent conflict and massacres, indicate that this is not a matter of mere error but bias. The debate had therefore changed from an argument over whether there was an excessive focus on negative aspects of Australian history to one over to what extent, if at all, Australian Aboriginal history had been based on questionable evidence or had been falsified or fabricated and whether this had exaggerated the extent of violence against Aboriginal people. Particular historians and histories that are challenged include Lyndall Ryan and Henry Reynolds and the histories of massacres, particularly in Tasmania but also elsewhere in Australia. Windschuttle's naming of historians whom he accused of misrepresentation and fabrication of the historical evidence, created considerable controversy and produced a range of responses including condemnation of as well as support for his work.Attwood, Bain (2005). Telling The Truth About Aboriginal History, Manne, Robert(ed), (2003). Whitewash. On Keith Windschuttle's \\"Fabrication of Aboriginal History\\". Flood, Dr Josephine, The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, Allen & Unwin, 2006 Genocide debate The case for using the term \\"Australian genocide\\" rests on evidence from various sources that people argue proves some form of genocide. People cite the list of massacres of Indigenous Australians by white settlers, mainly in the 19th century; only a few massacres were documented, and the evidence is strong that evidence of massacres was generally covered by secrecy and there are powerful signs that documents had been destroyed. Evidence is solid that Queensland's Native Police produced diaries, collision reports and monthly and quarterly enumerations of \\"patrols\\" and \\"collisions\\" with Indigenous people, and that all of this material was stored in the Queensland police department. However, not one single sheet of information of this kind which is today available at the Queensland State archive originate from files delivered by the police department, the material left comes solely from other government offices. Only human interference can produce a total loss of the vast Native Police Force records once stored in the Queensland Police Department. Others have pointed to the dramatic reduction in the Tasmanian Aboriginal population in the 19th century and the forced removal of generations of Aboriginal children from their parents during the 20th century as evidence of genocide. The evidence includes documentation of the wish, and sometimes intention, of a significant proportion of late 19th-century and early 20th-century white Australians to see the Aboriginal \\"race\\" eliminated. Documents include published letters to the editors of high-circulation newspapers. Certainly this was the case in Queensland, in terms of Indigenous people the most populated section of Australia and certainly the colony with the most violent frontier. In June 1866 Sir Robert Herbert summing up his experience after little more than five years as the first Premier of this colony wrote: The \\"system\\", for which Herbert was among those personally responsible, was the \\"Native Police system\\" which typically went about \\"dispersing\\" any sign of Indigenous resistance at the frontier by use of deadly early morning attacks on Aboriginal camps. This semi-military force was allowed to go about its business, typically instigating large scale deadly retaliation without prior investigating of alleged crime. They generally took no prisoners at the frontier and there are no signs that they ever enforced any other \\"law\\" than \\"might is right\\". It was a force designed more in the manner of the recent times phenomenon known as the \\"death-squad\\" and the secrecy of its operations was ensured by the remoteness of its operations, added a system that denied the evidence from \\"blacks\\" while the force itself was instructed to ensure that there would always be only one white witness, the officer in charge of each detachment. Recently the first ever attempt to scientifically calculate the number of Aboriginal people killed in encounters with the Native Police indicates that numbers may exceed 45,000.Evans, Raymond & √òrsted‚ÄìJensen, Robert: 'I Cannot Say the Numbers that Were Killed': Assessing Violent Mortality on the Queensland Frontier\\" (paper at AHA 9 July 2014 at University of Queensland) publisher Social Science Research Network The phrase \\"useless race\\" was commonly expressed in Queensland, including in an 1877 editorial in The Queenslander (the weekly edition of the colony's main newspaper, the Brisbane Courier): \\"The desire for progressive advancement and substantial prosperity is, after all, stronger than sentimental dislike to the extinction of a savage and useless race\\".The Queenslander, 7 October 1876, page 12 Classifying Aboriginal people as a useless or unimprovable race was common. Debating the native police and the frontier in public in 1880 in the columns of The Queenslander, a prominent settler wrote: \\"And being a useless race, what does it matter what they suffer any more than the distinguished philanthropist who writes in this behalf cares for the wounded half dead pigeon he tortures at his shooting matches?\\".The Queenslander 8 May 1880, page 594-95 Remarks which were followed up in October of that years by Boyd Dunlop Morehead, one of the leading landholders, manager of the Scottish Australian Investment Co.'s Bowen Downs in 1866‚Äì81 and a future Premier, could be heard making the following acknowledgement in a parliamentary speech, saying, yes settlers in the past did go After the introduction of the word \\"genocide\\" in the 1940s by Raphael Lemkin, Lemkin himself and most comparative scholars of genocide and many general historians, such as Robert Hughes, Ward Churchill, Leo Kuper and Jared Diamond, basing their analysis on previously published histories, present the extinction of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people as a text book example of a genocide.Henry Reynolds, \\"Genocide in Tasmania?\\", in A. Dirk Moses (ed.) Genocide and settler society: frontier violence and stolen Indigenous children in Australian history, Berghahn Books, 2004 p. 128. The Australian historian of genocide, Ben Kiernan, in his recent history of the concept and practice, Blood and soil: a world history of genocide and extermination from Sparta to Darfur (2007), treats the Australian evidence over the first century of colonisation as an example of genocide.Ben Kiernan, \\"Genocidal Violence in Nineteenth-Century Australia\\", in his Blood and soil: a world history of genocide and extermination from Sparta to Darfur Yale University Press, 2007, pp. 249‚Äì309. Among scholars specialising in Australian history much recent debate has focused on whether indeed what happened to groups of Indigneous people, and especially the Tasmanian Aboriginal people, during the European colonisation of Australia can be classified as genocide. According to Mark Levene, most Australian experts are now \\"considerably more circumspect\\".Mark Levene, Genocide in the Age of the Nation State: The rise of the West and the coming of genocide, I. B. Tauris, 2005 , p. 344 footnote 105 In the specific instance of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people, Henry Reynolds, who takes events in other regions of colonial Australia as marked by \\"genocidal moments\\",Henry Reynolds, The Question of Genocide in Australia's History (2001), cited in Ann Curthoys, Genocide in Tasmania: The History of an Idea, in A. Dirk Moses, Empire, colony, genocide, p. 245 argues that the records show that British administrative policy in Tasmania was explicitly concerned to avoid extermination. However, in practice, the activities of British people on the ground led to virtual extinction.Henry Reynolds, \\"Genocide in Tasmania?\\" in A. Dirk Moses Empire, Colony, Genocide: Conquest, Occupation, and Subaltern Resistance in World History, Berghahn Books, 2008 , pp. 127‚Äì147. Tony Barta, John Docker and Anne Curthoys however emphasize Lemkin's linkage between colonisation and genocide. Barta, an Australian expert in German history, argued from Lemkin that, \\"there is no dispute that the basic fact of Australian history is the appropriation of the continent by an invading people and the dispossession, with ruthless destructiveness, of another\\". Docker argues that, \\"(w)e ignore Lemkin's wide-ranging definition of genocide, inherently linked with colonialism, at our peril\\". Curthoys argues that the separation between international and local Australian approaches has been deleterious. While calling for \\"a more robust exchange between genocide and Tasmanian historical scholarship\\", her own view is that the Tasmanian instance constitutes a \\"case for genocide, though not of state planning, mass killing, or extinction\\". Much of the debate on whether European colonisation of Australia resulted in genocide, centres on whether \\"the term 'genocide' only applies to cases of deliberate mass killings of Aboriginal people by European settlers, or ... might also apply to instances in which many Aboriginal people were killed by the reckless or unintended actions and omissions of settlers\\".\\"Debates on Genocide ‚Äì Part One Debates on 'Genocide' in Australian History\\" , Australian Government Department of Education Science and Training Historians such as Tony Barta argue that for the victim group it matters little if they were wiped out as part of a planned attack. If a group is decimated as a result of smallpox introduced to Australia by British settlers, or introduced European farming methods causing a group of Aboriginal people to starve to death, the result is, in his opinion, genocide.\\"Debates on Genocide ‚Äì Part One Debates on 'Genocide' in Australian History\\" , Australian Government Department of Education Science and Training. citing Tony Barta, \\"Relations of Genocide: Land and Lives in the Colonization of Australia\\", in Genocide and the Modern Age: Etiology and Case Studies of Mass Death, Isidor Wallimann & Michael N. Dobkowski (eds.), New York, Westport, Connecticut, London, Greenwood Press, 1987, pp. 237‚Äì251. Henry Reynolds points out that European colonists and their descendants frequently use expressions that included \\"extermination\\", \\"extinction\\", and \\"extirpation\\" when discussing the treatment of Aboriginal people during the colonial period, and as in his opinion genocide \\"can take many forms, not all of them violent\\".\\"Debates on Genocide ‚Äì Part One Debates on \\"Genocide\\" in Australian History\\" , Australian Government Department of Education Science and Training. citing Reynolds, An Indelible Stain? The Question of Genocide in Australia's History, Ringwood, Viking, 2001, p. 2. Janine Roberts has argued that genocide was Australian policy, even if only by omission. She notes that despite contemporary newspapers regularly decrying \\"the barbarous crop of exterminators\\", and \\"a system of native slaughter ... merciless and complete\\", the government contended that \\"no illegal acts were occurring\\", with the worst incidents being described as merely \\"indiscretions\\". The political scientist Kenneth Minogue and other historians such as Keith Windschuttle disagree and think that no genocide took place.\\"Debates on Genocide ‚Äì Part Two Debates on 'Genocide' in Australian History\\". Australian Government Department of Education Science and TrainingWindschuttle, Keith Minogue does not try to define genocide but argues that its use is an extreme manifestation of the guilt felt by modern Australian society about the past misconduct of their society to Aboriginal people. In his opinion its use reflects the process by which Australian society is trying to come to terms with its past wrongs and in doing this Australians are stretching the meaning of genocide to fit within this internal debate.\\"Debates on Genocide ‚Äì Part Two Debates on 'Genocide' in Australian History\\". Australian Government Department of Education Science and Training. Citing Kenneth Minogue, Aborigines and Australian Apologetics, Quadrant, (September 1998), pp. 11‚Äì20. In the April 2008 edition of The Monthly, David Day wrote further on the topic of genocide. He wrote that Lemkin considered genocide to encompass more than mass killings but also acts like \\"driv[ing] the original inhabitants off the land ... confin[ing] them in reserves, where policies of deliberate neglect may be used to reduce their numbers ... Tak[ing] Indigenous children to absorb them within their own midst ... assimilation to detach the people from their culture, language and religion, and often their names.\\"  Controversy over smallpox in Australia  The arrival of smallpox in Australia is of uncertain origin and is a major theme in the history wars. The lack of immunity among Aboriginal Australians to introduced diseases saw smallpox or some related disease inflict a devastating toll on the Aboriginal population. Though the First Fleet itself did not arrive with any known carriers of the disease, the observation of an epidemic, usually taken to be smallpox, among the Aboriginal population of Sydney around 16 months after the British arrived has led to speculation that the Fleet itself brought this disease to Australia. Some historians have suggested that the disease may have been either released by accident or via theft of medicine stores or perhaps been deliberately employed as a form of \\"germ warfare\\" against indigenous Australians. Inoculation was commonly practised by surgeons decades before 1796 and even after the process of smallpox vaccination was introduced by Edward Jenner. Dried smallpox scab was thus commonly stored in glass containers as part of a surgeon's remedies.Butlin, Noel: Our Original Aggression, Sydney 1983, pp. 19‚Äì24. Early speculation on the origins of the disease is recorded in the writing of a First Fleet Captain of Marines, Watkin Tench, who noted an \\"extraordinary calamity\\" among the Aboriginal people of Sydney, beginning in April 1789. Repeated accounts of dead bodies marked with pustules consistent with smallpox began being reported around Sydney Harbour around this time. Tench wrote that the colonists' observations had led them to suppose that smallpox was not known in New South Wales and as no First Fleeters had suffered from the disease, its sudden existence among the Aboriginal people was \\"inexplicable\\". Tench speculated as to whether the disease might be indigenous to the country; or whether it had been brought to the colony by the French expedition of Lap√©rouse a year before; traversed the continent from the West where Europeans had previously landed; brought by expedition of James Cook; or indeed by the first British settlers at Sydney. \\"Our surgeons brought out variolous matter in bottles\\", he wrote, \\"but to infer that it was produced from this cause were a supposition so wild as to be unworthy of consideration.\\"Watkin Tench; 1788: Edited and Introduced by Tim Flannery; The Text Publishing Company; Melbourne; 1996. Subsequently, and despite the lack of certainty over how or when the disease reached Australia, there has been a history war regarding the way that smallpox arrived in Australia, especially whether it was deliberately used as a crude biological weapon against indigenous peoples. Medical scientists such as Sir Edward Stirling and Sir John Cleland published a number of books and articles between 1911 and 1966 suggesting that smallpox arrived in Northern Australia from an Asian source.Flood, Dr Josephine, The Original Australians, p. 126. A rival theory, that smallpox was introduced to NSW in 1789 by British settlers, was put forward in 1914 by the director of the Australian Quarantine Service, Dr J. H. L. Cumpston.Cumpston, JHL \\"The History of Small-Pox in Australia 1788‚Äì1908\\", Government Printer (1914) Melb. In 1983, Professor Noel Butlin, an economic historian, suggested: \\"it is possible and, in 1789, likely, that infection of the Aboriginal people was a deliberate extermination act\\". Historians David Day and Henry Reynolds repeated Butlin's claims and in 2001 Reynolds wrote: \\"one possibility is that the epidemic was deliberately or accidentally let loose by someone in the settlement at Sydney Cove. Not surprisingly this is a highly contentious proposition. If true, it would clearly fall within the ambit of the Genocide Convention\\".Flood, Dr Josephine, The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, published by Allen & Unwin, 2006, p125. Butlin argued that while Macassan fishermen could possibly 'have landed the virus on the Australian mainland at some stage their ability to do so was limited'.Butlin: Our Original Aggression, p. 20 It is furthermore highly unlikely, he argued, that this virus should have been brought down from the Gulf of Carpentaria to coincidence with the first major outbreak \\"just fifteen months after the landing of the first fleet\\". Besides the time factor connected to Macassans, 'over seven or eight weeks (or more)', the type of vessels, the limited potential for contact between Aboriginal people and fishermen, and the fact of clothing as carrier and virus is destroyed or seriously reduced in contact with salt water, makes the Macassan theory highly unlikely, he argued. Indeed, infected 'Macassans would be either dead or fully recovered long before reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria.Butlin: Our Original Aggression, p. 32 Whereas transfer somehow, theft accident or the like, from scab originally stored in glass containers carried by just one of the seven medical officers on the first fleet seems the most likely cause.Butlin: Our Original Aggression, pp. 19‚Äì20 & 29‚Äì37. C. C. Macknight (1986) an authority on the centuries-old interaction between indigenous Australians and the people of Makassar (later part of Indonesia), revived the theory that smallpox was introduced to Australia by Macassan mariners visiting Arnhem Land.Macknight, C. C. \\"Macassans and the Aboriginal past\\" in Archaeologia Oceania publication-date=1986 volume=21 pages=69‚Äì75 Australian virologist Frank Fenner (1988) ‚Äì who in 1977‚Äì80 led the successful World Health Organization (WHO) campaign to eradicate smallpox and was the principal author of a 1988 WHO report, Smallpox and its Eradication ‚Äì pointed out that no cases of smallpox were reported amongst convicts, sailors, military personnel, or free settlers, on the First Fleet. The virus was also not reported among British or Aboriginal people at Port Jackson over the following 15 months. It was, therefore, unlikely that a person suffering from smallpox and travelling with the First Fleet had caused the 1789 outbreak. While there were cases of smallpox in Macassar during 1789, there are no reports of it occurring prior to that period. However, smallpox had long been present in island South East Asia ‚Äì possibly as early the 4th century according to Frank Fenner.Fenner, cited by Victor T. King, 1998, Environmental Challenges in South-East Asia, London/New York, Routledge, p. 78. There were outbreaks of smallpox in Indonesia throughout the 18th century.King, Environmental Challenges in South- East Asia, pp. 78‚Äì79; M. C. Ricklefs, 1993, A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1200, Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 72, 85, and; Atsushi ≈åta, 2006, Changes of Regime and Social Dynamics in West Java: Society, State and the Outer World of Banten, 1750‚Äì1830, Leiden, Brill, pp. 79, 109, 113. These included, for example, major epidemics in the Sultanate of Tidore (in the Moluccas) during the 1720s, the Sultanate of Banjar (South Kalimantan), in 1734, 1750‚Äì51, 1764‚Äì65 and 1778‚Äì79; and in southern Sumatra during the 1750s, the 1770s, and in 1786. Macassans had contact with these areas both directly and indirectly (through foreign traders and invaders). David Day (2001) reiterated Butlin's argument and suggested that members of Sydney's garrison of Royal Marines may have attempted to use smallpox as a biological weapon in 1789.David Day, Claiming a Continent A New History of Australia, HarperCollins, Sydney, 2001, p. 42f. The following year, however, John Connor stated that Day's theory was \\"unsustainable\\".John Connor, The Australian Frontier Wars, 1788‚Äì1838, UNSW Press, 2002, p29. In a 2002 book, Invisible Invaders, historian Judy Campbell ‚Äì advised by Fenner ‚Äì reviewed reports of disease amongst Aboriginal people from 1780‚Äì1880, including the smallpox epidemics of 1789‚Äì90, the 1830s and the 1860s. Campbell argues that the evidence, including that contained in these reports shows that, while many diseases such as tuberculosis were introduced by British colonists, this was not so for smallpox and that the speculations of British responsibility made by other historians were based on tenuous evidence, largely on the mere coincidence that the 1789‚Äì90 epidemic was first observed afflicting the Aboriginal people not long after the establishment of the first British settlement. Campbell argues instead that the north-south route of transmission of the 1860s epidemics (which is generally agreed), also applied in the earlier ones. Campbell noted that the fleets of fast Macassan fishing vessels, propelled by monsoonal winds, reached Australia after being at sea for as little as ten to fifteen days, well within the incubation period of smallpox. The numbers of people travelling in the fleets were large enough to sustain smallpox for extended periods of time without it 'burning out'. The Macassans spent up to six months fishing along the northern Australian coastline and Aboriginal people had \\"day-to-day contact with the islanders. Aboriginals visited the praus and the camps the visitors set up on shore, they talked and traded....\\"Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 ‚Äì 1880, by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp. 73‚Äì74 She also notes that Butlin, writing in 1983, \\"did not recognize that Aboriginals were 'great travellers', who spread infection over long distances....\\" and that smallpox was spread through their extensive social and trading contacts as well as by Aboriginal people fleeing from the disease.Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 ‚Äì 1880, by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp. 61, 181 Campbell also cited British historian Charles Wilson, who cited \\"medical microbiology\\" in disagreeing with Butlin about the origins of the 1789 outbreak, and \\"doubted his estimates of its demographic impact\\", as well as \\"First Fleet historian Alan Frost [who] also disagreed with Butlin's views\\".Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 ‚Äì 1880, by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, p 31 The independent scholar Christopher Warren (2007) claimed that Fenner did not address the issue of variolous material brought in bottles by the First Fleet.Warren C., \\"Could First Fleet smallpox infect Aborigines? ‚Äì A note\\", Aboriginal History 31, pp. 152‚Äì164. This material was carried by First Fleet surgeons for inoculation purposes.For details on this process, known as variolation, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variolation See also \\"Smallpox and Cowpox under the Southern Cross‚Äù, cited above. Warren argued that, even if the variolous material was degraded, it could still infect susceptible people. Smallpox spread by the inhalation of airborne droplets of virus in situations of personal contact or by contact with blankets, clothing or other objects that an infected person had recently used.Flood, Dr Josephine, The Original Australians, pp. 125‚Äì126. Warren also suggested that Frost's view was based on a false premise: that the First Fleet's stocks of virus were sterilised by summer heat. In a wide-ranging (13-page) discussion of medical literature on the survival of smallpox virus, Warren conceded there was evidence that ‚Äúvirus from scabs survived for mere months at a continuous temperature of 30C‚Äù. However, he assumed the bottles were, both on the voyage and in Sydney, properly curated and ‚Äúinsulated in chests and packaging‚Äù. He argued that, ‚ÄúThe chest contents would have remained close to each day‚Äôs average [temperature] depending on the insulation and the thermal mass‚Äù. Hence, he concluded, ‚ÄúFirst Fleet stocks never experienced 30C, day and night‚Äù. Warren, 2007, pp. 156-160. Craig Mear (2008) and Michael J. Bennett (2009) have disputed Campbell's hypothesis that smallpox was introduced to Australia in 1789 through contact between Aboriginal people and mariners from Makassar.Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 ‚Äì 1880, by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp. 55, 61Craig Mear, The origin of the smallpox outbreak in Sydney in 1789.

Hist. Med. 83(1), Spring 2009. H. A. Willis (2010), in a survey of much of the literature discussed above, reiterated the argument made by Campbell. In response, Warren (2011) suggested that Willis had not taken into account research on how heat affects the smallpox virus, cited by the World Health Organization. In reply, Willis (2011) reiterated that his position was supported by a closer reading of Frank Fenner's report to the World Health Organization (1988) and invited readers to consult that report online. Macknight re-entered the debate in 2011, declaring: \\"The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Macassan] trepangers on the north coast and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.\\"Macknight, Campbell \\"The view from Marege': Australian knowledge of Macassar and the impact of the trepang industry across two centuries \\" in Aboriginal History publication-date=2011 volume=35 pages=121‚Äì143. In 2010 John Carmody, a professor of medicine, put forward an alternative theory on Robyn Williams's ABC Radio Science Show. Carmody asserted that the 1789 epidemic could not have been smallpox and was almost certainly chickenpox.Science Show segment: Chicken pox or smallpox in the colony at Sydney Cove in April, 1789. Carmody argued that smallpox, being much less infectious than chickenpox, could not have spread so rapidly from tribe to tribe around Sydney (nor from Arnhem Land to the Sydney region); but if present would certainly have infected some of the European colonists: \\"If it had really been smallpox, I would have expected about 50 cases amongst the colonists.\\" This would have produced several recorded deaths, since smallpox has about a 30% fatality rate. However, the only non-Aborigine reported to have died in this outbreak was a seaman called Joseph Jeffries, who was recorded as being \\"a North American Indian\\".See https://www.geni.com/people/Joseph-Jeffries-Crew- Supply-1788/6000000073111673102 and more specifically http://www.ffghs.org.au/page8.php .

Originally published London, (1798), p 496, partly quoted in Dowling p. 59. Carmody pointed out that chickenpox can take a severe toll on populations with little hereditary or acquired immunological resistance, and that it was certainly present in the colony. With regard to how smallpox might have reached the colony, Carmody later said: \\"There is absolutely no evidence to support any of the theories and some of them are fanciful and far-fetched.\\" In response, Christopher Warren rejected suggestions that chickenpox caused the 1789 epidemic.Warren, Christopher: \\"Smallpox outbreak of Sydney's past\\", with rejoinder by Carmody, Ockhams Razor ABC Radio National, 2014.

United Service, Journal of the Royal United Services Institute of New South Wales, vol. 65 (1), March 2014, pg. 7. Carmody's argument on the Science Show was not, for some time, followed by a scholarly paper, and was ignored by many historians. However another medical researcher working on Aboriginal epidemiology, Dr G E Ford stated in late 2010 that he had previously and independently reached Carmody's conclusions: \\"In a project applying a specialist understanding of disease and epidemiology from my own previous professional life as a pathobiologist, I had verified that the small pox was not Smallpox but was Chicken Pox brought to the colony in a latent form later known as Shingles.\\" Ford also said that he had \\"identified a likely convict carrier and the means by which the chicken pox infection spread through the population\\".Darki√±ung Recognition An Analysis of the Historiography for the Aborigines from the Hawkesbury-Hunter Ranges to the Northwest of Sydney by Geoffrey Eric ('Geoff') Ford [Ph.D., ANU] 2010 MA thesis in history, University of Sydney 2010, pp. 34‚Äì35, cf. pp. 11, 32. However Ford concedes that neither he nor Carmody can claim priority for this theory since: \\"In 1985 a teacher of 'medical geography', Peter Curson of Macquarie University presented a good case on historic evidence that the disease was chickenpox.Peter H. Curson, 1983, ' \\"All Dead! All Dead!\\" ‚Äì The Great Sickness of 1789', Chapter Three pp. 41‚Äì53 in Times of Crisis: Epidemics in Sydney 1788‚Äì1900, Sydney University Press, Sydney. [Also] At a conference on \\"Aboriginal Studies\\" in 1987, archaeologist Barry Wright presented his conclusionBarry Wright, 1988 [presented 1987], \\"Aborigines; A Question of Pathogens\\", in Barry Wright, Daniel Moody & Leon Petchkovsky (eds), 1988, Contemporary Issues in Aboriginal Studies: 2, Proceedings of the Second National Conference on Aboriginal Studies, Nepean College of Advanced Education [now University of Western Sydney], October 1987, Firebird Press, Sydney, pp. 117‚Äì21. that: 'I believe ... that an introduced epidemic of chickenpox not smallpox swept through the tribes, its effects every bit as deadly as if it had been smallpox.'\\" To maintain coherence with earlier historical accounts, Ford refers to \\"the small pox epidemic\\" of 1789‚Äì1791, but makes two words of \\"small pox\\" and reminds the reader that he believes the \\"small pox\\" in question was \\"Chicken Pox, a small pox other than Smallpox\\".Ford, p. 11 This convention has been followed by some later writers. In fact another academic thesis that, like Ford‚Äôs, was little noticed at the time but is now available on line, had already established that the chickenpox theory is far older than 1985. The settlement historianSee his bio at http://www.sunkenstories.com/content/people/dr-peter-dowling.htm Peter J Dowling in his 1997 ANU PhD thesis ‚ÄúA Great Deal of Sickness‚Äù ‚ÄúA Great Deal of Sickness‚Äù: Introduced diseases among the Aboriginal People of colonial Southeast Australia 1788-1900. noted evidence that the 1789 epidemic was one to which (unlike smallpox) older European children were immune. He quotes the observation of the Judge-Advocate and Secretary of the Colony, David Collins that, ‚ÄúNotwithstanding the town of Sydney was at this time filled with children, many of whom visited the natives that were ill of this disorder, not one of them caught it.‚Äù Dowling pp. 60-61. Despite this, Dowling largely discounts the chickenpox theory, which had, in 1997, few public champions among medical experts. He argues that most Europeans in the colony seem to have accepted the outbreaks were smallpox, a disease with whose signs they ‚Äúwould have been familiar‚Äù.Dowling, p. 89. Yet he documents considerable uncertainty among the authorities, and also disagreements among colonial surgeons, on this point. He notes for instance Mair‚Äôs argument that the 1789 and 1830 epidemics may have been the same disease: Mair was convinced that the 1830 epidemic was smallpox; yet Dowling remarks: Dowling regrets that the diaries of the first fleet surgeons have not survived, but judges that, ‚ÄúDespite the varied nature of the surviving historical documents there is strong evidence that the three epidemics were indeed smallpox.‚Äù Yet he notes: Dowling‚Äôs wide-ranging research produces other complications. He says that by 1830, with the assistance of well-meaning settlers, many Aborigines seem to have been either vaccinated (with cowpox), or else inoculated /‚Äúvariolated‚Äù with ‚Äúvariolous matter‚Äù (scrapings of dried and perhaps partly de-natured smallpox scab)‚Äîa method which would seem to have risked spreading either smallpox or its partial lookalike chickenpox, but provided significant protection against smallpox.Dowling, p. 73, cf. p. 50 and p. 84. Also, he notes that there are genetic variations, and large variations in virulence, among strains of smallpox. Warren (2014) subsequently rejected the theory that the 1789 epidemic had originated from Macassar. He claimed that there was no evidence of a major outbreak of smallpox in Macassar before 1789;Warren cites records from Macassan hospitals established by the Dutch East India Company and the results of research by P. Boomgaard, reported in his \\"Smallpox and Vaccination in Java 1780‚Äì1860: Medical Data as a Source for demographic History\\" in Dutch medicine in the Malay Archipelago 1816‚Äì1941 : articles presented at a symposium held in honor of Prof. Dr. D. de Moulin on the occasion of his retirement ... (1989) there were no indigenous trade routes that would have enabled overland transmission from Arnhem Land to Port Jackson;Warren cites: F. D.

This is What Happened: Historical Narratives by Aborigines (1986) and 1829 was the earliest point at which there was possible evidence that Makassans had been the source of a smallpox outbreak.

A few weeks later, the Ockham‚Äôs Razor radio program for 13 April 2014 invited Chris Warren to restate his 2013-2014 arguments that the 1789 outbreak was in fact smallpox, and was probably deliberately introduced. Warren argued it was suspicious that in April 1789 a smallpox epidemic ‚Äúwas reported amongst the Port Jackson Aboriginal tribes who were actively resisting settlers from the First Fleet.‚ÄùThe Ockham‚Äôs Razor transcript does not include citations for this or other statements made by the two participants. He claimed that ‚ÄúThe chickenpox theory was first floated by Richard Hingston in 1985,‚Äù but was speedily dismissed by Frank Fenner. He acknowledged Carmody‚Äôs and Ford‚Äôs argument that the case of shingles detected on the first fleet meant that chickenpox was present. Yet, citing Watkin Tench‚Äôs journal, he argued that smallpox was also present in 1789 in still- viable ‚Äúvariolous matter‚Äù, sealed in the surgeons‚Äô glass jars: Warren also argued that Mair‚Äôs report (suggesting that Aborigines with scars from the 1789 epidemic were immune to the 1829-1830 one) ‚Äútherefore demonstrates that the earlier outbreak was true smallpox‚Äù. Warren also mounted arguments that smallpox could not have arrived overland nor by sea. He argued that the British forces were perilously short of men, muskets and ammunition, and concluded it is probable that ‚Äúsome authority, not necessarily involving Governor Phillip, ordered the deployment of smallpox‚Äù [from the glass jars], perhaps ‚Äúas an act of military necessity‚Äù. Carmody was allowed a brief (218-word) right of reply on the same Ockham‚Äôs Razor program. He rejoined: Carmody also rejected Warren‚Äôs argument that the surgeons‚Äô smallpox samples were still viable in April 1789, saying: Stolen Generations debate Despite the lengthy and detailed findings set out in the 1997 Bringing Them Home report into the Stolen Generation, which documented the removal of Aboriginal children from their families by Australian State and Federal government agencies and church missions, the nature and extent of the removals have been disputed within Australia, with some commentators questioning the findings contained in the report and asserting that the Stolen Generation has been exaggerated. Sir Ronald Wilson, former President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission and a Commissioner on the Inquiry, has stated that none of the more than 500 witnesses who appeared before the Inquiry were cross-examined. This has been the basis of criticism by the Coalition GovernmentStolen Generations, Background Briefing, ABC Radio National, broadcast 2 July 2000. Retrieved 19 February 2008. and by the anthropologist Ron Brunton in a bookletBrunton, R. \\"Betraying the victims: The 'Stolen Generations' Report\\", in IPA Backgrounder Vol. 10/1, 1998. published by the Institute of Public Affairs that was criticised in turn by the lawyer Hal Wootten. (1998) 4(12) Indigenous Law Bulletin 4. An Australian Federal Government submission has questioned the conduct of the Commission which produced the report, arguing that the Commission failed to critically appraise or test the claims on which it based the report and failed to distinguish between those separated from their families \\"with and without consent, and with and without good reason\\". Not only has the number of children removed from their parents been questioned, but also the intent and effects of the government policy. Some critics, such as columnist and social commentator Andrew Bolt, have questioned the very existence of the Stolen Generation. Bolt stated that it is a \\"preposterous and obscene\\" myth and that there was actually no policy in any state or territory at any time for the systematic removal of \\"half-caste\\" Aboriginal children. Robert Manne responded that Bolt did not address the documentary evidence demonstrating the existence of the Stolen Generations and that this is a clear case of historical denialism.Manne, Robert The cruelty of denial, The Age, 9 September 2006 Bolt then challenged Manne to produce ten cases in which the evidence justified the claim that children were \\"stolen\\" as opposed to having been removed for reasons such as neglect, abuse, abandonment, etc. He argued that Manne did not respond and that this was an indication of unreliability of the claim that there was policy of systematic removal. In reply, Manne stated that he supplied a documented list of 250 names Bolt stated that prior to a debate, Manne provided him with a list of 12 names that he was able to show during the debate was \\"a list of people abandoned, saved from abuse or voluntarily given up by their parents\\"; and that during the actual debate, Manne produced a list of 250 names without any details or documentation as to their circumstances. Bolt also stated that he was subsequently able to identify and ascertain the history of some of those on the list and was unable to find a case where there was evidence to justify the term \\"stolen\\". He stated that one of the names on the list of allegedly stolen children was 13-year-old Dolly, taken into the care of the State after being \\"found seven months pregnant and penniless, working for nothing on a station\\". The Bolt/Manne debate is a fair sample of the adversarial debating style in the area. There is focus on individual examples as evidence for or against the existence of a policy, and little or no analysis of other documentary evidence such as legislative databases showing how the legal basis for removal varied over time and between jurisdictions, or testimony from those who were called on to implement the policies,Many Voices: Reflections on Experiences of Indigenous Child Separation National Library of Australia Oral History Project, 2002. http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2002/nov02/article3.html which was also recorded in the Bringing Them Home report. A recent review of legal cases claims it is difficult for Stolen Generation claimants to challenge what was written about their situation at the time of removal. (2008) 32(2) Melbourne University Law Review 382. The report also identified instances of official misrepresentation and deception, such as when caring and able parents were incorrectly described by Aboriginal Protection Officers as not being able to properly provide for their children, or when parents were told by government officials that their children had died, even though this was not the case. The new Australian Government elected in 2007 issued an Apology similar to those that State Governments had issued at or about the time of the Bringing Them Home report ten years earlier. On 13 February 2008, Kevin Rudd, prime minister of Australia, moved a formal apology in the House of Representatives, which was moved concurrently by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. It passed unanimously in the House of Representatives on 13 March 2008. In the Senate, the leader of the Australian Greens moved an amendment seeking to add compensation to the apology, which was defeated in a vote of 65 to 4. after which the motion was passed unanimously. Windschuttle's The Fabrication of Aboriginal History The historian Keith Windschuttle has disputed the historiography for the number of children in the Stolen Generations as well as the violence of European colonisation, arguing that left-wing scholars had exaggerated these events for their own political purposes. Windschuttle's 2002 book The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803‚Äì1847 focuses on the Black War in Tasmania; he says that there is credible evidence for the violent deaths of only 118 Tasmanian Aboriginal people, as having been directly killed by the British, although there were undoubtedly an unquantifiable number of other deaths for which no evidence exists. He argues that the Tasmanian Aboriginal population was devastated by a lethal cocktail of introduced diseases to which they had little or no resistance due to their isolation from the mainland and the rest of humanity for thousands of years. The deaths and infertility caused by these introduced diseases, combined with the deaths from what violent conflict there was, rapidly decimated the relatively small Aboriginal population. Windschuttle also examined the nature of those violent episodes that did occur and concluded that there is no credible evidence of warfare over territory. Windschuttle argues that the primary source of conflict between the British and the Aboriginal people was raids by Aboriginal people, often involving violent attacks on settlers, to acquire goods (such as blankets, metal implements and 'exotic' foods) from the British. With this and with a detailed examination of footnotes in and evidence cited by the earlier historical works, he criticises the claims by historians such as Henry Reynolds and Professor Lyndall Ryan that there was a campaign of guerrilla warfare against British settlement. Particular historians and histories that are challenged include Henry Reynolds and the histories of massacres, particularly in Tasmania (such as in the Cape Grim massacre) but also elsewhere in Australia. Windschuttle's claims are based upon the argument that the 'orthodox' view of Australian history were founded on hearsay or the misleading use of evidence by historians. Windschuttle argues that, in order to advance the 'deliberate genocide' argument, Reynolds has misused source documentation, including that from British colonist sources, by quoting out of context. In particular, he accuses Reynolds of selectively quoting from responses to an 1830 survey in Tasmania in that Reynolds quoted only from those responses that could be construed as advocating \\"extermination\\", \\"extinction\\", and \\"extirpation\\" and failed to mention other responses to the survey, which indicated that a majority of respondents rejected genocide, were sympathetic to the plight of the Aboriginal people, feared that conflict arising from Aboriginal attacks upon settlers would result in the extinction of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people and advocated the adoption of courses of action to prevent this happening.Windschuttle, pp. 326‚Äì350. Windschuttle's claims and research have been disputed by some historians. In Whitewash: On Keith Windschuttle's Fabrication of Aboriginal History, an anthology including contributions from Henry Reynolds and Professor Lyndall Ryan, edited and introduced by Robert Manne, professor of politics at La Trobe University, Manne argues that Windschuttle's arguments are \\"unpersuasive and unsupported either by independent research or even familiarity with the relevant secondary historical literature\\". Other academics including Stephen Muecke, Marcia Langton, and Heather Goodall also expressed concerns about Windschuttle‚Äôs work. In \\"Contra Windschuttle\\", an article published in the conservative publication Quadrant, S.G. Foster examined some of the evidence that Windschuttle presented on one issue, Stanner's notion of the \\"Great Australian Silence\\". In Foster's opinion, the evidence produced by Windschuttle did not prove his case that the \\"Great Australian Silence\\" was largely a myth. Windschuttle argues that, in the years prior to Stanner's 1968 Boyer lecture, Australian historians had not been silent on the Aboriginal people although, in most cases, the historians' \\"discussions were not to Stanner's taste\\" and the Aboriginal people \\"might not have been treated in the way Reynolds and his colleagues would have liked\\".Windschuttle, pp. 408, 409. Foster argues that Windschuttle is \\"merciless with those who get their facts wrong\\" and that the fact that Windschuttle has also made a mistakeWindschuttle wrote that a particular text was not used at the University of Sydney or the University of New South Wales when Foster states that it was: S.G. Foster, Contra Windschuttle means that he did not meet the criteria that he used to assess 'orthodox historians' he was arguing against and whom he accused of deliberately and extensively misrepresenting, misquoting, exaggerating and fabricating evidence relating to the level and nature of violent conflict between Aboriginal people and white settlers. At the time of the publication of The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One it was announced that a second volume, to be published in 2003, would cover claims of frontier violence in New South Wales and Queensland, and a third, in 2004, would cover Western Australia. On 9 February 2008, however, it was announced that the second volume, anticipated to be published later in 2008, would be titled The Fabrication of Australian History, Volume 2: The \\"Stolen Generations\\" and would address the issue of the removal of Aboriginal children (the \\"stolen generations\\") from their families in the 20th century. The new volume was released in January 2010, now listed as Volume 3, with a statement that Volumes 2 and 4 would appear later. Announcing the publication, Windschuttle claimed that the film Rabbit-Proof Fence had misrepresented the child removal at the centre of the story, and offered inaccurate accounts of Molly's journey as it was recounted by her daughter, Doris Pilkington. These claims were subsequently rejected by the makers of the film. Stuart Macintyre's The History Wars In 2003, the Australian historians Stuart Macintyre and Anna Clark published The History Wars.Macintyre S, Clark A. The History Wars. Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 2003. This was a study of the background of, and arguments surrounding, recent developments in Australian historiography, and concluded that the History Wars had done damage to the nature of objective Australian history. At the launch of his book, historian Stuart Macintyre emphasised the political dimension of these argumentsWho plays Stalin in our History Wars? The Sydney Morning Herald, 17 September 2003 and said the Australian debate took its cue from the Enola Gay controversy in the United States. The book was launched by former prime minister Paul Keating, who took the opportunity to criticise conservative views of Australian history, and those who hold them (such as the then‚Äìprime minister John Howard), saying that they suffered from \\"a failure of imagination\\", and said that The History Wars \\"rolls out the canvas of this debate\\". Macintyre's critics, such as Greg Melluish (History Lecturer at the University of Wollongong), responded to the book by declaring that Macintyre was a partisan history warrior himself, and that \\"its primary arguments are derived from the pro-Communist polemics of the Cold War\\". Keith Windschuttle said that Macintyre attempted to \\"caricature the history debate\\". In a foreword to the book, former Chief Justice of Australia Sir Anthony Mason said that the book was \\"a fascinating study of the recent endeavours to rewrite or reinterpret the history of European settlement in Australia\\".Macintyre, Stuart & Clark, Anna, p. ?? National Museum of Australia controversy In 2001, writing in Quadrant, a conservative magazine, historian Keith Windschuttle argued that the then-new National Museum of Australia (NMA) was marred by \\"political correctness\\" and did not present a balanced view of the nation's history.How not to run a museum: People's history at the postmodern museum. reproduced at In 2003 the Howard Government commissioned a review of the NMA. A potentially controversial issue was in assessing how well the NMA met the criterion that displays should: \\"Cover darker historical episodes, and with a gravity that opens the possibility of collective self-accounting. The role here is in helping the nation to examine fully its own past, and the dynamic of its history‚Äîwith truthfulness, sobriety and balance. This extends into covering present-day controversial issues.\\" While the report concluded that there was no systemic bias, it recommended that there be more recognition in the exhibits of European achievements. The report drew the ire of some historians in Australia, who claimed that it was a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to politicise the museum and move it more towards a position which Geoffrey Blainey called the 'three cheers' view of Australian history, rather than the 'black armband' view. In 2006 columnist Miranda Devine described some of the Braille messages encoded on the external structure of the NMA, including \\"sorry\\" and \\"forgive us our genocide\\" and how they had been covered over by aluminium discs in 2001, and stated that under the new Director \\"what he calls the 'black T-shirt' view of Australian culture\\" is being replaced by \\"systematically reworking the collections, with attention to 'scrupulous historical accuracy'\\". An example of the current approach at the NMA is the Bells Falls Gorge Interactive display, which presents Windschuttles's view of an alleged massacre alongside other views and contemporary documents and displays of weapons relating to colonial conflict around Bathurst in 1824 and invites visitors to make up their own minds. University of New South Wales controversy Publication in 2016 of \\"Indigenous Terminology\\" guidelines\\"Indigenous Terminology\\" University of New South Wales; https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/indigenous-terminology for the teaching and writing of history by the University of New South Wales created a brief media uproar.Invasion of the history rewriters, Daily Telegraph 30 March 2016; http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/invasion-of-the-history- rewriters/news-story/d18774ad2553314898261298cef4e17d Amongst the advised language changes, they recommended \\"settlement\\" be replaced by \\"invasion\\", \\"colonisation\\" or \\"occupation\\". They also deemed that the generally accepted anthropological assumption that \\"Aboriginal people have lived in Australia for 40,000 years\\" should be dropped for \\"... since the beginning of the Dreaming/s\\" as it \\"reflects the beliefs of many Indigenous Australians that they have always been in Australia, from the beginning of time\\" and because \\"many Indigenous Australians see this sort of measurement and quantifying as inappropriate.\\" While some commentators considered the guidelines appropriate,Daley, Paul \\"It's not 'politically correct' to say Australia was invaded, it's history\\", The Guardian (Australia) 30 March 2016; https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2016/mar/30/its- not-politically-correct-to-say-australia-was-invaded-its-history others categorised them as political correctness that was an anathema to learning and scholarship.Graham, Chris Australian university accused of 'rewriting history' over British invasion language, The Telegraph (London) 30 March 2016; https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/12207016/Australian- university-accused-of-rewriting-history-over-British-invasion-language.html History wars and culture wars The \\"history wars\\" are widely viewed, by external observers and participants on both sides as similar to the \\"culture war\\" underway in the United States. William D. Rubinstein, writing for the conservative British think tank the Social Affairs Unit, refers to the history wars as \\"the Culture War down under\\". Participants in the debate including Keith Windschuttle and Robert Manne are frequently described as \\"culture warriors\\" for their respective points of view.

The team is owned by longtime NASCAR driver Ken Schrader. Over the years, Schrader has also fielded his team in the NASCAR Cup, Xfinity, and Truck Series in addition to in ARCA. NASCAR Xfinity and Cup Series =Beginnings= Schrader began fielding his own team in 1987 in the then- Busch Series, driving the No. 45 Red Baron Pizza Ford Thunderbird at North Carolina Speedway. Qualifying 21st, he finished 5th, one lap down. He switched to the No. 52 and Chevrolets in 1988 and picked up sponsorship from Exxon. Running ten races, he had two top-fives and finished 32nd in points. In 1989, he made twelve races and picked up his first win in the Busch Series at Dover, and ran with Kodiak sponsorship in 1990. During the 1990 season, his team ran its first Winston Cup race when Brian Ross drove the No. 58 Pontiac at Pocono Raceway, finishing 27th after suffering an engine failure. Schrader would change his number to 15 in 1991, and had four top-five finishes. AC Delco became the new team sponsor in 1992, and Schrader finished 29th in points, a career-best for him in the Busch Series. He switched back to the No. 52 in 1993, winning the pole at the season opening race, but had three top-tens, his lowest total since 1990. In 1994, he won his most recent race at Talladega Superspeedway, and had two other top-fives. After the 1995 season, the team retired from the Busch Series. NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series Schrader began fielding trucks during the series' inaugural season in 1995. Driving the No. 52 Chevrolet Silverado with an AC Delco sponsorship, he made seven starts and won at Saugus Speedway. He ran three races in his truck in 1996, sharing the ride with Tobey Butler, who won the pole at Evergreen Speedway. Schrader Racing also ran a pair of Cup races, with Jack Sprague driving the No. 52 Pedigree Petfoods-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix, his best finish being 23rd at Phoenix. Tobey Butler Schrader Racing Chevrolet 1997 Butler was hired as the team's full-time driver in 1997, with Purolator becoming the team's new sponsor. After eleven races, he was replaced by Mike Wallace, who had a second-place finish at California Speedway. Schrader himself ran a second entry, the No. 53 Penda Truck Accessories-sponsored Chevy, at Richmond International Raceway, finishing sixth. Wallace drove exclusively for Schrader in 1998, posting eleven top-tens. He would leave for Ultra Motorsports at the end of the season, and Purolator ended its sponsorship in NASCAR. Rookie Scott Hansen was tabbed as the new driver of the 52, and Oakwood Homes became the team's new sponsor. Hansen qualified for every race and had three top-tens when Schrader replaced him in the final race of the year, where he crashed out. Hansen still finished 2nd in the NASCAR Rookie of the Year standings and eighteenth in points. The 52 team went back to part-time racing after picking up a Federated Auto Parts sponsorship in 2000, with Schrader sharing the ride with Lyndon Amick, who had a second-place run at Indianapolis Raceway Park. Schrader and Amick continued to run part- time in 2001, with Schrader himself posting a second-place finish at Darlington Raceway. During 2001 and 2002, KSR ran in the Busch Series again in the No. 07 Chevy with Schrader attempting a total of three races, and Michael Vergers failing to qualify in his attempt. In 2002, Wallace returned to the team as co-driver, replacing Amick. The two would combine for twelve starts and five top-ten finishes. Schrader ran eleven races in 2003, and Wallace four, with four top-tens. Wallace began the 2004 season with a third-place finish, before Schrader took over for the rest of the runs for the years. He had four top-tens and a pole at Bristol Motor Speedway. He made nine more starts in 2005, but had only one top-ten finish. =Hiatus and return= KSR did not run any Truck Series races over the next two seasons, focusing on the ARCA series, fielding entries for Chris Bristol. The team returned in 2008, when Schrader returned with Federated Auto Parts sponsoring his Toyota Tundra. In his first race back, he started 28th and finished 4th. Tyler Reddick, seen here spinning out, drove for the team in one race at Rockingham in 2013. The team returned once again in 2013 at the inaugural Mudsummer Classic at Eldora Speedway, with Schrader winning the pole position, becoming the oldest pole- sitter in NASCAR history. Schrader returned in his No. 52 in both 2014 and 2015 for the races at Eldora, which were the only NASCAR events he and his team competed in. In 2016, Schrader drove the No. 71 Toyota Tundra at Eldora's race in a partnership between his own team and Contreras Motorsports so he had a better chance of qualifying with the large entry lists the series was seeing that year. ARCA Menards Series 2011 and 2012 in between separate stints at Cunningham Motorsports. Here, he is seen racing at the second Pocono race in 2011. The team ran multiple drivers in 2013, including Austin Dillon at Road America, pictured here. Matt Tifft drove Schrader's No. 52 in ARCA part-time in 2014 The Ken Schrader Racing hauler driving through the infield at Road America. Notice that it still has the Menards design from 2016 only with the logos taken off. Austin Theriault driving his unsponsored No. 52 car at Road America in his championship-winning 2017 season. For 2016, the No. 52 team ran with one driver for the full season for the first time in over three years, with Matt Kurzejewski joining the team after getting many good finishes driving part-time for his own team for a few years. Despite not winning any races, he earned a third place finish in points. Also, they picked up sponsorship from Menards (as well as Ansell), which moved over to KSR after sponsoring Frank Kimmel since 2009. They replaced Federated Auto Parts as the team's full season sponsor. The team ran the full ARCA Racing Series schedule in 2017 with Austin Theriault. However, Menards did not return in 2017, and they were only able to find sponsors race-by-race. The team scored 7 wins en route to the championship, which Theriault and the team clinched in the penultimate race at Kentucky. The team struggled with finding sponsorship both that year and in 2018, and as a result, the team only guaranteed Theriault to run the car at the 2018 season opener at Daytona. However, weeks before the start of the season, those plans changed as the team signed up-and-comer Will Rodgers to drive for KSR part-time, starting at Daytona and then in a second car with sponsorship from Drydene. He had previously driven for KSR at ARCA's testing at Daytona in January 2018. Because Rodgers brought a sponsor and Theriault did not, Theriault was left without a ride. At the same time, they announced that Brandon Grosso would attempt to run all the races for them after Daytona (where he was still only 17 and not eligible to run there). Grosso was eventually released during the season, and Rodgers moved from the No. 11 car (which Schrader fielded in a collaboration with Fast Track Racing) to the team's primary car, the No. 52, for his remaining starts. After his own team was also struggling financially, Bret Holmes did not field his own No. 23 car at the race at Iowa and drove Schrader's No. 52 instead for that race along with two others. In 2019, the team only ran two races, at Daytona with Tyler Dippel and DuQuoin with Schrader himself. For 2020, Schrader's team partnered with late model team Fury Race Cars to jointly field Fury's driver Natalie Decker in the No. 52 at Daytona in preparation for her start in the Truck Series race there driving for Niece Motorsports. This will not be Fury's first time running a stock-car team, as they fielded a part-time Xfinity Series team in 2018 (but not in 2019).

It covers approximately 3,500 km¬≤ and crosses the boundaries of three French departments: Corr√®ze, Creuse, and Haute-Vienne. The majority of the area is at an altitude of between 600 m and 1000 m.  Structure and geology  Although commonly referred to as a plateau, the Millevaches Massif is actually more like a shallow dome, deeply dissected by streams and rivers, and slightly tilted, with the south-eastern edge elevated and more exposed. This is the visible remnant of a laccolith, a large lens-shaped mass of granite, believed to be the result of an intrusion of igneous material in the late Hercynian or Variscan orogeny.Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France; May 2004; v. 175; no. 3; p. 239-248; As the surrounding, softer material has weathered away, the laccolith has become increasingly exposed. Although not strictly a plateau, depending upon which direction one approaches the area from, the Plateau de Millevaches forms an important kind of step up (or a step down) in the Massif Central. There are a number of definite peaks, the highest being Mont Bessou (976m.), at the southern edge of the massif, near Meymac.  Character and features  The massif is generally densely wooded, with large areas of both coniferous forest and mixed woodland. Among the broadleaf trees, birch and beech predominate, and many roads are lined with beeches. The highest part of the massif, bounded roughly by the villages of Rempnat, Peyrelevade, Millevaches and Saint-Merd-les-Oussines, is the most densely wooded, with little agriculture or even stock-rearing intruding among the forests. Elsewhere, there is a patchwork of woods and meadows, with herds of Limousin cattle dotting the landscape, and a few fields of maize or rye. There is a distinctive type of bog or marsh (tourbi√®res in French) which gives rise to numerous rivers such as the Vienne. Many of these rivers are often filled with wild brown trout. The area around the village of Millevaches and the Signale d'Audouze (an outstanding peak) is part of an important watershed. The Vienne, which has its sources here, flows mainly northward, across central France, to feed the Loire. The V√©z√®re, which arises next to it, drains south into the Dordogne River, sending its water to the Atlantic via the Gironde estuary. Many of the rivers have been dammed to create large lakes. The largest of all is the Lac de Vassivi√®re, the result of damming the Maulde River. The nearby Lac de la Vaud-Gelade is fed by the Taurion River. The V√©z√®re feeds two large lakes at Viam and Treignac. All of these provide both drinking water and hydroelectricity. They are also home to major leisure attractions, being lined with beaches, sailing schools, marinas, camp sites and picnic areas. There are very few towns or villages of any size on the Plateau de Millevaches, but the towns of Meymac, Felletin, Ussel and Eymoutiers are situated at the edges of the Plateau.

The VM-T was modified to carry rocket boosters and the Soviet space shuttles of the Buran program. It is also known as the 3M-T. Design and development The design was conceived in 1978 when Myasishchev was asked to solve the problem of transporting rockets and other large space vehicles to the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Engineers used an old 3M (a modified M-4 bomber) and replaced the empennage with dihedralled horizontal stabilizers with large, rectangular end-plate tailfins to accommodate payloads measuring as large as twice the diameter of the aircraft's fuselage. A large, aerodynamically optimized cargo container, placed on top of the aircraft, would contain the freight. In addition, a new control system was added to the plane to compensate for the added weight. The Atlant first flew in 1981 and made its first flight with cargo in January 1982.History and details about the VM-T Atlant Its main task was to ferry Energia rocket boosters from their development plant to the Baikonur Cosmodrome. On several occasions, the Soviet space shuttle Buran was piggybacked to the Cosmodrome as well. Two Atlants were built. They were replaced in 1989 by Antonov's An-225 Mriya. One Atlant (RF-01502) is kept at the Zhukovsky International Airport in Russia owned by TsAGI and Gromov Flight Research Institute, the other one (RA-01402) at Dyagilevo (air base) in Ryazan.

He produced a series of 12 two reel short subject comedies starring Stan Laurel in the 1920s. Career Poster for Vamps and Variety (1919) Joe Rock began his career as a stunt double for Mary Pickford. He soon became a comedian in silent films working under his real name, Joe Simberg. He had a broad grin and protruding ears, which gave him a comical appearance ‚Äì but soon found greater success as a producer. A short-lived career with Vitagraph Studios as a comedian teamed with Earl Montgomery in countless comedy shorts such as Hash and Havoc (1916), Stowaways and Strategy (1917), Farms and Fumbles (1918), Harems and Hookum (1919), Zip and Zest (1919), Vamps and Variety (1919), Rubes and Robbers (1919), Cave and Coquettes (1919), Throbs and Thrills (1920), Loafers and Lovers (1920), and Sauce and Senoritas (1920). In the book Comedy is a Man in Trouble: Slapstick in American Movies by Alan Dale, Joe Rock described the two-reelers he made with Earl Montgomery saying, \\"We always finished our comedies with a shot of us running away from a cop, a schoolteacher, or a principal, and then running smack into them again. If we'd run away from cops, we'd run back into cops.\\" Rock then enlisted in the U.S. Army for infantry service in World War I. =Stan Laurel= By 1924, Stan Laurel had forsaken the stage for full-time film work, and was still involved with actress Mae Dahlberg. Among the films in which they jointly appeared was the 1922 parody, Mud and Sand. Around this time, Mae started interfering with Laurel's work and was holding him back. Laurel insisted (no doubt with pressure from her) that she be in his every picture, but audiences didn't like her. When Joe Rock put Laurel under contract for twelve two-reel comedies, the contract had one unusual stipulation, that Dahlberg was not to appear in any of the films. It was felt that her temperament was hindering his career. When she balked, Rock held firm, finally offering her a most unusual and humiliating deal. He would give her several thousand dollars, along with some jewels she had pawned, if she would go back to Australia. When Stan showed no inclination to demur, she accepted the offer. The ship's purser had strict instructions: Mae would not receive her payment until the ship was a day out at sea. Stan was finally free. Without any distractions, Stan finished the twelve films ahead of schedule, although he was still technically under contract to Joe Rock. Stan next joined the Hal Roach studio as a writer and director, but due to the contract with Joe, could not act in any of the films. The twelve two-reel comedies were Mandarin Mix-Up (1924), Detained (1924), Monsieur Don't Care (1924), West of Hot Dog (1924), Somewhere in Wrong (1925), Twins (1925), Pie- Eyed (1925), The Snow Hawk (1925), Navy Blue Days (1925), The Sleuth (1925), Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde (1925), Half a Man (1925). =Ton of Fun= From the Joe Rock Studios came the \\"A Ton of Fun\\" series of comedy shorts, promoted at the time as 'starring the three fattest men on the screen'. The series was launched in 1925 and ran two years. Alternatively known as The Three Fatties, they were played in order of girth by Hilliard \\"Fat\\" Karr, Kewpie Ross and Frank \\"Fatty\\" Alexander. The films were Tailoring (1925), All Tied Up (1925), Three Wise Goofs (1925), Heavy Love (1926), The Heavy Parade (1926), Three of a Kind (1926), Old Tin Shoes (1927), Three Missing Links (1927), and Campus Romeos (1927). Produced by Joe Rock, the shorts were made by Poverty Row studio Standard Photoplay Company and released by Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.'s Film Booking Offices of America, (F.B.O.). Ironically, comedian-turned- producer Joe Rock, who created the series, did not think The Three Fatties were fat enough. Frank Alexander and Kewpie Ross were actually padded far beyond their natural waistlines. Built on the premise that three fat men were funnier than one, Rock created a surprising number of outlandish situations for the trio during the series long run. =Elstree Studios= The Neptune Film Company opened the first studios in Borehamwood in 1914. It contained just a single small windowless stage (the first \\"dark stage\\" in England), relying entirely on electricity from a gas powered generator for lighting. Production ceased during 1917 and the studio was sold to the Ideal Film Company who used the site up until 1924. During 1928 the studio was sold to Ludwig Blattner. The Blattner Studio was leased to Joe Rock Productions during 1934 and 2 years later they purchased the site. Joe Rock appointed Ludwig Blattner's son Gerry as the studio manager.\\"The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo- Jewish History\\", edited by William D. Rubinstein, Michael Jolles, Hilary L. Rubinstein Palgrave Macmillan, 15 Mar 2011, Rock Productions built 4 new large stages and began making films including the feature The Edge of the World (1937). These studios would eventually (in 1984) become BBC Elstree Centre, Clarendon Road Studios, Borehamwood. =Michael Powell= In 1935 Rock met director Michael Powell. In return for Powell agreeing to direct The Man Behind the Mask, Rock agreed to back the filming of what would become The Edge of the World, Powell's directorial breakthrough. Krakatoa As a boy, Rock was an avid reader. He had been very impressed by a book that described the Krakatoa eruption of 1883. In that year, an obscure island in Indonesia exploded in one of the biggest volcanic eruptions of recorded history: the explosion was heard thousands of miles away, and many people died. In 1933, for the fiftieth anniversary of the eruption, Joe Rock produced a documentary titled Krakatoa: partly about the island's history before and after the eruption, but mostly about the eruption. Making the documentary was a challenge, because Joe had no film footage of the island and he was unable to locate any witnesses who recalled the original 1883 event. After making this movie on a very low budget and releasing it, Joe went on a trip to England. He had formed a production company to make Krakatoa, but he permitted that company to go out of business because he had no further projects envisioned for it. Academy Award Rock has the unenviable distinction of holding one of filmdom's more bizarre records: the longest wait between winning an Academy Award and actually receiving it. Rock produced the 1933 film Krakatoa, a documentary about the volcanic eruption of 1883. This film won the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Novelty) in 1933. However, Rock was in Europe at the time that the award was announced, and had no representative to claim the trophy. Rock's name did not appear in the film's credits. Meanwhile, his production company had failed, and when he returned to the United States he could no longer document that he was the head of the production company named in the film's credits. Almost fifty years later, while sorting out some of his papers, Rock located documents which established his proprietary claim ... and the Academy belatedly gave him his statuette. Later years In 1955, Rock co-produced a documentary exploitation film about the Mau Mau uprising called Mau Mau. Personal life Joe Rock was married to actress Louise Granville. They had two children actress Felippa Rock born in 1923 and writer Phillip Rock born in 1926. His grandson is actor Christopher Pate.

Traditionally Milton's Steam Era has also featured a parade of steam tractors down Main St. Origins & History A small group of local men, chatting at a machine shop in August, 1960, came up with the idea of a ‚Äústeam show‚Äù ‚Äî an annual event, where owners of vintage, steam-powered vehicles could parade their antique treasures. In August 1960, Bill Johnson of Burford and Les Lowe of Brookville were at Gordon Brigden's machine shop in Hornby and with the late Elmer Downs of Milton. the four discussed the possibility of putting on a steam show. On December 8. 1960 as a result of these discussions thirty-eight gentlemen gathered at Les Lowe's farm on the Guelph Line, north of Brookville. This was the founding meeting of the Ontario Steam and Antique Preservers' Association. The first one, dubbed the ‚ÄúSteam Era,‚Äù was held on Labour Day weekend, in 1961, and the tradition continues to this day. In its early years, the whole town would get swept up in the nostalgic exercise, as well as an accompanying festival, called ‚ÄúOld-Fashioned Days,‚Äù in which everyone would dress up in clothing of bygone days. By its third year, the Steam Era attracted 27,000 spectators in 1963. By 1965, it had grown to 40,000. In 1983, Miss Canada Jodi Rutledge and Miss Teen Canada Lori Assheton- Smith visited Steam Era.

Notice the dramatic curve of the Allegheny Front. Blue Mountain Ridge, Blue Mountain, or the Blue Mountains of Pennsylvania is part of the geophysical makeup of the Ridge-and- Valley Appalachians in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It is a ridge that forms the southern and eastern edge of the Appalachian mountain range spanning over from the Delaware Water Gap as it cuts across the eastern half of the state on a slight diagonal from New Jersey tending southerly until it turns southerly curving into Maryland, and beyond. Some distant view of The Blue Mountain dominates the southern tier of most eastern and central Pennsylvanian counties providing an ever visible backdrop cutting across the northern or western horizon. Most transport corridors and road beds piercing the barrier necessarily descend through either large water gaps (West to east: Susquehanna, Schuylkill, Lehigh and Delaware River valleys) or wind gaps their smaller tributary gaps cut by creeks, brooks, and lesser rivers. The descent into the southern lowlands are ramplike and before southbound travelers oft lays a scenic panorama spread from horizon to horizon. The barrier ridge forms a distinct boundary between a number of Pennsylvania's geographical and cultural regions. To the north of the Susquehanna Gap in the south-central part of the state are the Cumberland Valley tucked in the area above the water gap as if trying to flow through with the river; to its northwest side are the southern reaches of the Susquehanna Valley with picturesque streams channeling travel corridors deep into and over the central and western mountains and valleys‚Äîthe heartland interior counties of Pennsylvania; along the Main Branch Susquehanna, the valleys also lead into northeast Pennsylvania, into the \\"Northern Coal Region\\", of the Wyoming Valley and the distant Poconos. To the Blue Mountain Ridge's center, on the southern side lies the \\"capital region\\", about Harrisburg and nearby communities, the rich farming country of the Lebanon Valley, and Pennsylvania Dutch Country of York and Lancaster Counties, the lower half of the Lehigh Valley and the lower Delaware Valley; the latter two extend through water gaps beyond the ridgeline. Geography The ridge of Blue Mountain runs for through Pennsylvania, reaching an elevation of above sea level just north of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, near the borough of Newburg. Most of the ridgecrest, however, only reaches between and in elevation. The mountain's width varies from to . The southwestern end of the mountain is at Big Gap, west of Shippensburg. (The mountain ridge continues to the southwest toward Maryland under the name of Broad Mountain.) The northeastern end of the mountain is at the Delaware Water Gap on the New Jersey border.

They are similar to state parks in other countries. They are typically open to the public for recreation. Their environment may be more or less strictly protected. Argentina, Belgium, Canada and South Africa are among the countries that have provincial parks. Argentina Provincial parks () in the Misiones Province of Argentina include the Urugua-√≠ Provincial Park and Esmeralda Provincial Park. The Ischigualasto Provincial Park, also called Valle de la Luna (\\"Valley of the Moon\\" or \\"Moon Valley\\"), due to its otherworldly appearance, is a provincial protected area in the north-east of San Juan Province, north-western Argentina. The Aconcagua Provincial Park is in Mendoza Province. The highest point is the north summit of the Cerro Aconcagua at . The Parque Provincial Pereyra Iraola is the largest urban park in the Buenos Aires Province. It is the richest center of biodiversity in the province. Belgium Chevetogne Provincial Park - Play area Provincial parks in Belgium (, ) include Bois des R√™ves, Chevetogne, H√©l√©cine, Palogne and W√©gimont. These are typically public areas administered by the province for outdoor recreation such as swimming, canoeing, hiking and camping, with few or no fully protected portions. Canada Provincial parks in Canada are protected areas of land and/or water designated by one of the provincial governments to protect nature or historical sites and to support recreation, tourism and education. The first provincial park, Queen Victoria Park in Niagara Falls, opened in 1888. The largest is the Polar Bear Provincial Park on Hudson Bay. Although provincial parks in Canada are not the same as national parks, their structures and purposes are very similar. The provincial and territorial parks systems generally have various park categories. Parks may be ecological reserves without facilities for use by the general public, day use parks or recreational parks that offer many services to visitors, often including bicycle, canoe, or kayak rentals, camping sites, hiking trails and beaches. In the province of Quebec, the provincial parks are labelled \\"national parks\\" and are all IUCN category II protected areas (like at the federal level, and as opposed to many provincial parks), and are managed by Soci√©t√© des √©tablissements de plein air du Qu√©bec. Many parks in the other provinces have the IUCN designation. South Africa Nwanedi Provincial Park is a scenic nature and game reserve on the foothills of the Venda mountains in the northern part of the Limpopo province of South Africa. Mokolo Dam Provincial Park almost surrounds the Mokolo Dam on the Mokolo River. It is located 32 km south of Lephalale, just northeast of the Marakele National Park and not far from the Lapalala Game Reserve.State of Rivers Report: the Mokolo River Letaba Ranch Provincial Park in Limpopo Province is north of Phalaborwa, next to the Kruger Park and has an area of about 42,000 ha.

Until 1569 he ruled together with his brother, Henry of Dannenberg. William was the son of Ernest I, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg.

It was called Nui Bang (Even Mount) and renamed Ngu Binh in Gia Long's reign. Its top is flat with pine trees everywhere\\". Together with the Perfume River, Ngu Binh Mountain forms a natural ensemble to Hu·∫ø. For a long time, this mountain and the river have been the symbols of Hu·∫ø, and people often call Hu·∫ø, \\"The land of the Perfume River and Ngu Binh mount\\" or \\"Huong-Ngu Land\\". For many centuries, many generations of poets and travelers have recognized it a place to admire nature.  Geography  The 105m high Ngu Binh Mountain has a symmetric figure. On both sides of the Even Mount (Bang Son) are 2 small mounts called Ta Bat Son (Left Mount) and Huu Bat Son (Right Mount). After observing that Bang Son resembled a screen, the Nguy·ªÖn emperor decided to build up Hu·∫ø which became known as their \\"Forbidden Purple City.\\" Emperor Gia Long approved the design of geomancers which chose this mount as a front altar of the imposing and solid defending wall system, and renamed it Ngu Binh. On fine days, from the top of Ngu Binh Mount, people can view the city and river, the pine forests on the hills and large plains of Huong Thuy, Phu Vang, Huong Tra Districts with plants and trees. In the distance, the dark purple Truong Son Mountain range lies hidden behind clouds. Towards the east is a dim white sand strip and Thuan An Estuary in the distance along the deep blue Eastern Sea. Some kilometers away from Ngu Binh Mountain is Vong Canh hill, across from Ngoc Tran Mountain. From the Vong Canh hill, people can behold fruit gardens green with areca (betel nut) palms, longan trees, orange groves (including mandarin variety), grapefruit trees, etc. Mingling with pine trees, grey roofs of pagodas and temples, as well as the ancient and meditative tombs, the Perfume River looks like a soft silk strip winding at the foot of the hill.

Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified August 9, 2013 He became a prominent sportsman as owner of the St. Louis Cardinals franchise in Major League Baseball from 1953 until his death. The Cardinals inducted him into the team Hall of Fame in 2014. Early life August Anheuser Busch Jr. was born on March 28, 1899, in St. Louis, Missouri. His father was August Anheuser Busch Sr. and the President of Anheuser-Busch. His mother was Alice Zisemann. His paternal grandfather, Adolphus Busch, was the German-born founder of Anheuser-Busch. Career =Anheuser-Busch= Starting at lower levels to learn the family business of Anheuser-Busch Company, Busch became superintendent of brewing operations in 1924 and head of the brewing division after his father's death in 1934.Robert McG. Thomas Jr., \\"August A. Busch Jr. Dies at 90; Built Largest Brewing Company\\", On This Day, New York Times, September 30, 1989, accessed July 3, 2015. After his older brother Adolphus Busch III's death in 1946, August A. Jr. succeeded him as President and CEO. He led the company to become the largest brewery in the world by 1957, having previously competed with Pabst and Schlitz for the top spot. He expanded it from a single site in St. Louis to operating nine separate breweries nationwide. By 1973, Anheuser-Busch had \\"aggregate beer sales of 26,522,000 barrels\\". In 1964, under his leadership, production at the St. Louis facility alone reached the ten million barrels-per-year mark. Described as a showman and salesman, Busch began using the Clydesdale team in 1933, putting them into service to commemorate the end of Prohibition by having a team \\"haul the first case of Budweiser down Pennsylvania Avenue for delivery to President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House\\". He made their image part of the company logo and had them appear regularly at public events.\\"Budweiser's Famous 'Eight- Horse Hitch',\\" Brewers Digest 27.5 (May 1952), 40-41 In May 1975 Busch was forced to step down as CEO and chairman of the company after a boardroom coup led by his son, August Busch III. He had become increasingly difficult to work with due to his grief over the loss of his youngest daughter at the end of 1974. He was allowed to remain president of the Cardinals and use the company perks associated with that job only if he represented the move as voluntary on his part. A year after being forced out, Busch considered working with the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company on a hostile takeover in an attempt to regain his leadership, but decided he could not be the one to take the company away from the family, a move that was not made public for ten years. The extent to which Busch had been sidelined, too, was not publicly known during his lifetime. Divisions in the Busch family resulting from the coup persisted long afterwards, playing a part in InBev's 2008 takeover of the company. =St. Louis Cardinals= In 1953, Cardinals owner Fred Saigh was convicted of tax evasion. Facing almost certain banishment from baseball, he put the Cardinals up for sale. When Busch got word that Saigh was seriously considering selling the team to interests who would move the team to Houston; he decided to have Anheuser-Busch get into the bidding in order to keep the Cardinals in St. Louis. Ultimately, Anheuser-Busch bought the Cardinals for $3.75 million‚Äìsomewhat less than what Saigh was being offered by the Houston suitors. It has long been believed that Busch convinced Saigh that civic pride was more important than money. In truth, according to Anheuser-Busch biographer William Knoedelseder, Saigh's first preference had been to sell to local buyers. Busch had been the first credible buyer who was willing to keep the team in town. As chairman, president or CEO of the Cardinals from the time the club was purchased by the brewery in 1953 until his death, Busch oversaw a team that won six National League pennants (1964, 1967, 1968, 1982, 1985, and 1987) and three World Series (1964, 1967 and 1982). When his son, August Busch III, ousted him as president of Anheuser-Busch, the elder Busch remained as president of the Cardinals. Although the Cardinals were the dominant baseball team in St. Louis, they did not own their own ballpark. Since 1920, they had rented Sportsman's Park from the St. Louis Browns of the American League. Shortly after buying the Cardinals, Busch bought and extensively renovated the park, renaming it Busch Stadium (but only after a failed attempt to rename it as Budweiser Stadium). The team played there until Busch Memorial Stadium was built in the middle of the 1966 season. In 1984, the Cardinals retired a number, 85, in Busch's honor, which was his age at the time. Personal life Busch married four times, having a total of 11 children. Two of his marriages ended in divorce. His third wife, Gertrude Buholzer (1927-2016), a native of Switzerland, was a Roman Catholic. Their seven children were raised in their mother's faith, and Busch was later received into that church, although the union was dissolved in 1978. His fourth wife, the former Margaret Rohde, died in 1988. His youngest child, by Gertrude Buholzer, daughter Christina Martina Busch, died at the age of eight in a car accident while on her way home from school in December 1974. At the time of his death, his surviving children (with married names) were Carlota Busch Giersch of Pasadena, California, and Lilly Busch Hermann (wife of Bob Hermann) of St. Louis, both daughters of the late Mrs. Marie Church Busch; August A. Busch III of St. Louis and Elizabeth Busch Burke of Middleburg, Virginia, both children of the late Elizabeth Overton Busch; and Adolphus A. Busch III and Beatrice Busch von Gontard, both of St. Louis; Peter W. Busch of Vero Beach, Florida; and Trudy Busch Valentine, William K. Busch and Andrew D. Busch of St. Louis, all six the children of the late Gertrude Buholzer Busch. Death and legacy Busch died in St. Louis on September 29, 1989, at age 90, of pneumonia. Fred Kuhlman took over as Cardinals team president. Seven years later in 1996, Anheuser-Busch sold the Cardinals to a group of investors led by William DeWitt, Jr. In 2014, the Cardinals announced Busch would be among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

In North America, the term steam tractor usually refers to a type of agricultural tractor powered by a steam engine, used extensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In Great Britain, the term steam tractor is more usually applied to the smallest models of traction engine - typically those weighing seven tons or less - used for hauling small loads on public roads. Although known as light steam tractors, these engines are generally just smaller versions of the 'road locomotive'. This article concentrates on the steam-powered agricultural vehicles intended for the direct-pulling of ploughs and other implements (as opposed to cable-hauling). Development (Great Britain) Owing to differences in soil conditions, the development of steam-powered agricultural machines differed considerably on either side of the Atlantic. In Great Britain, a number of traction engine builders attempted to produce a design of agricultural engine that could pull a plough directly, in place of a team of horses. However, the heavier and wetter soils found in Britain meant that these designs were not successful ‚Äî being less economical to use than the team of horses they were intended to replace. These engines were also known as \\"steam tractors\\". Instead, farmers resorted to cable-hauled ploughing using ploughing engines. A distinctive example of a British-designed (agricultural) steam tractor is the Garrett Suffolk Punch, a 1917 design intended to compete directly with internal combustion-powered alternatives. Development (North America) Best steam tractor (manufactured in California). The first steam tractors that were designed specifically for agricultural uses were portable engines built on skids or on wheels and transported to the work area using horses. Later models used the power of the steam engine itself to power a drive train to move the machine and were first known as \\"traction drive\\" engines which eventually was shortened to \\"tractor\\". These drive mechanisms were one of three types: chain, shaft, and open pinion. The open pinion became the most popular design due to its strength. Later improvements included power steering, differentials, compounded engines, and butt-strap boiler design. The steam engine was gradually phased out by the mid-1920s as the less expensive, lighter, and faster-starting internal combustion (kerosene, petrol or distillate) tractors fully emerged after World War I. Uses =Threshing= The drive belt: used to transfer power from a portable engine to a threshing machine These engines were used extensively in rural North America to aid in threshing, in which the owner/operator of a threshing machine or threshing rig would travel from farmstead to farmstead threshing grain. Oats were a common item to be threshed, but wheat and other grains were common as well. On a \\"threshing day\\", all the neighbors would gather at that day's farmstead to complete a massive job in one day through cooperation. The women and older girls were in charge of cooking the noon meal and bringing water to the men. The children had various jobs based upon their age and sex. These jobs included driving the bundle racks, pitching bundles into the threshing machine, supplying water for the steam engine, hauling away the freshly threshed grain and scooping it into the granary. Steam traction engines were often too expensive for a single farmer to purchase, so \\"threshing rings\\" were often formed. In a threshing ring, multiple farmers pooled their resources to purchase a steam engine. They also chose one person among them to go to a steam school, to learn how to run the engine properly. There were also threshing contractors, who owned their own engine and thresher, and went to different farms, hiring themselves out to thresh grain. =Ploughing= The immense pulling power of steam tractors allowed them to be used for ploughing as well. Certain steam tractors were better suited for ploughing than others, with the large Minneapolis Threshing Machine Co., J.I. Case, Reeves & Co., and Advance-Rumely engines being prime examples. Some of the largest steam tractors, such as the Case (known as \\"Road Locomotives\\"), were capable of pulling 30 or more plough bottoms, while most were powerful enough to pull between 6 and 20. Differing soil conditions highly affected the ploughing abilities of these tractors.

It ended in Japanese victory. Background Ukita Hideie marched on Namweon with around 49,600 soldiers on 11 September 1597. They arrived on 23 September. Namweon was garrisoned by 3,000 Ming soldiers and 1,000 Koreans under Yang Yuan and I Boknam. Battle The Japanese began by sending 100 soldiers to test the fort's defenses. On 24 September, the Japanese filled the trench with straw and earth. Then they took shelter in the burned out houses in the city. On 25 September, the Japanese asked the defenders to surrender, but they refused. On the night of 26 September, the Japanese bombarded Namweon for two hours while their men climbed the walls and used fresh straw to create a ramp to the top. Unable to burn the moist rice stalks, the defenders were helpless against the Japanese onslaught and the fortress fell. Aftermath Yang Yuan managed to break the Japanese encirclement and escape with 100 men. He reached Jeonju only to find it deserted. The Ming commander assigned to the city's defense, Chen Youyuan, not only ignored the call for help Yang had sent him, but fled the moment news of Namweon's fall arrived.

However, studies of supplementation with large doses of Œ≤-carotene in smokers have shown an increase in cancer risk, possibly because excessive Œ≤-carotene results in breakdown products that reduce plasma vitamin A and worsen the lung cell proliferation induced by smoke. The chief Œ≤-carotene breakdown product suspected of this behavior is trans-beta-apo-8'-carotenal (common apocarotenal), which has been found in one study to be mutagenic and genotoxic in cell cultures which do not respond to Œ≤-carotene itself.

Synopsis It was a one-hour live studio based show broadcast nationally 5 nights a week from 29 January 1990 to 26 November 1993, usually commencing at 10:30 pm every week night. Presented by Australian lawyer turned comedian and writer Steve Vizard, the show's format was an eclectic mix of a traditional Tonight Show, in the vein of US programs Late Show with David Letterman, The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson or Jay Leno with more off-beat, often deconstructionist elements, such as broadcasting a rehearsal of the show, a rained out show, a parallel Tonight show, using the floor manager and cameramen as on air talent, using the studio audience to replace high-profile guests and the like. Awards The show won the late night ratings around Australia and won several awards, Television Society Awards, and Logie Awards, including the 1991 Gold Logie for host Steve Vizard as Most Popular Person on Australian Television, Vizard was also nominated on three other occasions. Guest star appearances One of the main features or fixtures of the show was the diversity of its guest stars, with both local and international personality's featuring. An average show featured at least three interviews with often unexpected disclosures. Over the show's history, in excess of 2,000 guests appeared on Tonight Live With Steve Vizard. Some of the best known guests included Peter Allen, Steve Allen, Jeffrey Archer, Michael Aspel, Neil Aspinall, Anita Baker, Kathy Bates, David Bellamy, George Benson, Cilla Black, Deborah Blando, Lothaire Bluteau, John Bluthal, Victor Borge, Daryl Braithwaite, Marlon Brando, Michael Caine, Chevy Chase, Julian Clary, Jackie Collins, Pauline Collins, Phil Collins, Harry Connick Jr., Alice Cooper, Cindy Crawford, Russell Crowe, Billy Crystal, Macaulay Culkin, Jamie Lee Curtis, Charles Dance, Edward de Bono, G√©rard Depardieu, Phyllis Diller, Kirk Douglas, Michael Douglas, Robert Downey Jr., Duran Duran, Sheena Easton, Clint Eastwood, Britt Ekland, Ben Elton, Gloria Estefan, Emilio Estevez, John Farnham, Sally Field, Bob Geldof, Mel Gibson, Whoopi Goldberg, Jill Goodacre, Elliott Gould, Jerry Hall, Daryl Hannah, Debbie Harry, Goldie Hawn, Audrey Hepburn, Bob Hope, Whitney Houston, Barry Humphries, Natalie Imbruglia, Jeremy Irons, Billy Joel, Elton John, Quincy Jones, Tom Jones, B.B.

The first major guest on the first show was Peter Allen. On the third night, Kylie Minogue was on the show. She mentioned that she thought it was a dream because everything looked like Letterman, but there was no Dave. In 1990, Milli Vanilli, later to be embroiled in a lip- synching scandal, appeared and appeared to sing and Vizard complimented them on how well they had \\"sung\\". The miming scandal broke the next day . Occasionally, Vizard fell asleep on the show, most memorably during his interview with Australian fashion designer Pru Acton. Vizard asked Acton a question requiring a considerable answer, during which he nodded off only to be woken by the band played off to a commercial break. Vizard often entertained his guest before the show at a nearby restaurant in Melbourne, Lynch's, and often a member of the crew had to race to the restaurant to retrieve Vizard and his guests so that they wouldn‚Äôt miss the start of the show. On several occasions the show was starting as Vizard entered the studio. In a 1991 episode, Vizard, actor G√©rard Depardieu and film director Peter Weir were dining at Lynch‚Äôs before the show. After sampling the best in heavy Australian reds they raced back for the show, and on air, G√©rard Depardieu, insisted on opening bottles of Grange, which he and Vizard drank on air. Agro, a puppet who frequently uses sexual innuendo and adult humor, was one of the most popular guests and guest hosts with both the audience and Vizard himself. Eric Bana was given his first break on Tonight Live. In 1992, Paula Yates stood in as guest host. The same night her husband Bob Geldof was the surprise guest and conducted a surreal interview over satellite.  Music  Tonight Live featured its own in house band, for the first three years, The Groovematics, a jazz band led by renowned jazz pianist and composer Paul Grabowsky.The Australian Art Orchestra: Board Members Vizard and Grabowsky had been friends since their studies at University of Melbourne and Vizard referred to Grabowsky as \\"the Count\\". Every episode featured at least one live performance of local and internationally acclaimed musicians generally accompanied by the Count and the Groovematics. Some of the musicians who appeared on the show included Stephan Grappelli, Harry Connick Jr. and his Big Band, George Benson, ZZ Top, Randy Crawford, Spinal Tap, Buddy Guy, Duran Duran, Cilla Black, Tom Jones, Lou Rawls, Cleo Laine, Alice Cooper, Dionne Warwick, BB King, Phil Collins, John Farnham, Kylie Minogue and Southern Sons  News and weather  One of the Seven Network‚Äôs requirement for the show was that it contain a small news update. This was presented by Jennifer Keyte in the first three years, who Vizard called the \\"Hostess with the Mostess\\". Naomi Robson was the newsreader in later years. The news also included a weather segment, traditionally not the most compelling television. On Tonight Live, high-profile guests were used to present the weather including Bob Geldof, Ben Elton, Kylie Minogue, The Georgian Knife Throwers, and Australian businessman and entrepreneur Dick Smith.  Stunts, pranks and mishaps  Some of the most memorable moments on Tonight Live were those that were unscripted and unexpected, many of which may not have gone to air except that the show was live. ‚Ä¢ In 1991 Tonight Live was \\"rained out\\". Wimbledon, the tennis tournament, was broadcast live on a competing network had been rained out again. Vizard claimed that his Tonight Show had been rained out too, and using special effects, created the effects of rain in the studio, the crew wandering around in wet weather gear sweeping water from the covers, and guests in the control room looking forward to the rain easing so they could get out there. ‚Ä¢ In 1991, Mr Lifto, from the freakish Jim Rose Circus Sideshow, had multiple piercings and hung concrete blocks from his nipples, suitcases from his ears, and an iron from his penis. The modesty screen erected around Mr Lifto could not hide his elongated member as he started swinging the iron, which was accidentally broadcast live to a national TV audience. The network demanded the nude segment be removed before the show was telecast in the western states. Vizard, always looking to cause sensation, replayed the Mr Liftos nudity again the following night, and once more in slow motion. ‚Ä¢ In the 1990 Australian Federal election Vizard nominated one of the show‚Äôs writers, Mitchell Faircloth, (a.k.a. Slim Whittle from the Whittle Family) as a Senate candidate in Western Australia. Mitchell used the show to make policy speeches and a camera followed him on the hustings. ‚Ä¢ On one show Vizard asked the studio audience if any of them had tattoos and a large man took off his shirt and revealed a back covered in ink. A member of the Victorian Police Major Crime Squad was watching the show at home and recognized the tattooed man from his tattoos as a wanted criminal, and arrived at the studio and arrested the criminal before the show was over. ‚Ä¢ One night the show consisted entirely of footage that had obviously been recorded during a rehearsal. This resulted in many unrefined moments being put to air, including liberal use of swear words. The broadcast ended with the countdown that usually heralded the moments immediately preceding a live broadcast. ‚Ä¢ During a filmed visit to London, Vizard boards a randomly selected London taxi to interview the driver. The driver reveals himself as Tony Walker, one of the original Seven Up participants who since their childhood were interviewed every seven years about the progress of their lives. ‚Ä¢ Vizard had a television set installed on the host set so that he could turn over at any time and see what Tonight Live was up against on the other stations. When Tonight Live found itself up against a good match from Wimbledon, he would swing over the TV on his set to let the viewers watch the match and know the score. ‚Ä¢ To celebrate his 100th episode Vizard hosted a dinner party in which he invited stars and Seven Network executives to the Studio and broadcast it live. ‚Ä¢ A lottery show, in which all of the guests and segments in the show were allocated different numbers; a machine was used to randomly select the order and elements of the show. ‚Ä¢ One stunt that caused immense trouble with the network and their star current affair host, Derryn Hinch, was when Vizard incited Terry Willesee, a guest, to brick up the door to Derryn Hinch‚Äôs dressing room. ‚Ä¢ In an episode that confused the audience and angered the Network, Vizard broadcast in its entirety for one hour the amateur uncut wedding video of one of the members of the crew who had recently been married. ‚Ä¢ The show purchased and trained its own greyhound which it raced under the name Tonight Live. ‚Ä¢ On one episode a genuine wedding of an audience member including a stag party and reception was squeezed into one hour. ‚Ä¢ For one week, Vizard ran a segment called Nudie Hobbies, in which actors demonstrated different hobbies such as stamp collecting and scrabble in the nude. The public outrage was reflected in warnings from the Network. Unbeknownst to the Network, Vizard had a bet to get the ratings up to 20 and Nudie Hobbies won his bet. ‚Ä¢ The show included an on- set fax machine (at the time the show ran these were just becoming popular) and Vizard regularly read out viewer faxes and rang viewers from the phone on his desk. Occasionally he asked viewers to come into the studio, on several occasions asking for pizzas to be delivered to the studio audience, for takeaway Chinese to be delivered and even for a masseur to attend to massage one of his guests. ‚Ä¢ When the set was renovated in 1991, Vizard replaced the guest chairs with different chairs each night. One night, a dentists chair was used for guests and Eddie Fisher, the singer and Father of Carrie Fisher, was interviewed in the dentists chair and given a free dental check up at the same time. ‚Ä¢ On the week of the first show, Channel 7‚Äôs parent company Qintex had just been placed in receivership and Vizard joked in that maiden show \\"Welcome to Tonight Live, or item number 731 in the Qintex catalogue.\\" ‚Ä¢ When guest hosts appeared, Vizard's voice would announce that they would be 'playing the role of Mister Steven Vizard', reinforcing a concept that he had mentioned at the time, that he saw his on-screen persona as a character.  Outside broadcasts and non-studio shows  Tonight Live often left the studio, sometimes without any planning, and broadcast from the street, suburbs and often bizarre locations. The show was often broadcast for a week at a time from remote locations such as London, New York, Spain,Talking TelevisionAU: 1991: 13‚Äì19 July Sydney, the Great Barrier Reef, a bowling alley, an aircraft carrier, Vizards home and an Italian viewers backyard BBQ. One show was broadcast from an open top convertible driving around St. Kilda. Prostitutes were picked up. Japanese Tourists were given a guided tour of the city. Another show was hosted by Vizard on the back of a motorcycle being ridden through the city by World Motorcycle champion Mick Doohan. Another show was broadcast from tram as it trundled around Melbourne. Against expert advice, Tonight Live broadcast one episode in 1992 from maximum security of Pentridge Prison in the inner northern Melbourne suburb of Coburg. The show was broadcast from the notorious H-Division, the area of the jail where the hard men were housed and featured attractive women including Dannii Minogue and Ally Fowler, performing before the many convicted murderers in the 70 person prison audience. In 1992, Tonight Live broadcast from London for a week, each show from a different location. One London episode from the dining room at London‚Äôs Ritz Hotel starred UK talk show hosts Terry Wogan, Michael Parkinson, Ben Elton, Alexi Sayle, Joanna Lumley, Kylie Minogue, Michael Caine and Jane Seymour. Another UK episode was broadcast from a Village in the Cotswolds and featured Oliver Reed who arrived drunk and dishevelled, went on camera and began to tell x-rated stories of his time in the British SAS, including one about the eagle that was tattooed on his penis. Another episode from the Duke of Malboroughs ancestral home, Blenheim Palace, featured Spike Milligan and Gary Glitter. The show broadcast the near- death of show regular Glenn Robbins who was flying overhead in a two-seater ultra light aircraft at about 2000 feet, when his scarf became caught in the single propeller. The resulting crash landing in the Blenheim lake was broadcast live across Australia. In a 1992 show from Barcelona, Spain, Vizards crew surprised him by arranging for him to fight a bull. Vizard dressed in his matador outfit which had been rented from The State Opera‚Äôs production of Carmen, and was bright red. The bull took one look at Vizard and attacked him and Vizard ran.  On-air family and regulars  Tonight Live established an \\"on-air family\\" which included Dutchman Jack Degenkamp, the world‚Äôs oldest cameraman. Jack gave tips on clog dancing, demonstrated levitation and even delivered a Christmas message on the last show of the year. In 1993 he was the subject of a Tonight Live special : Jack Degekamp, This is Your Life. Merv Ford, the floor manager, was also used on air. Merv‚Äôs star shone so brightly that when he was working as floor manager for Seven‚Äôs coverage of the Australian Open Tennis he was recognised by the crowd more often than some of the players. Other on air regulars included Paul Grabowsky the band leader. Later, a young red-headed floor manager named Dane Clarke would fill in for Merv and feature in stunts. Another on air regular was a member of the production staff, Leanne Rollins (AKA Leanne from Yarck) who worked in the Tonight Live office. On the second show a guest pulled out at the last minute, so Leanne was roped in show and told stories and showed pictures of her father‚Äôs donkey, which happened to be in a state or arousal when the photo was taken. Tonight Live always had a stand-by guest in case someone failed to turn up who for the first three months of the show was historian Magnus Clarke who was an expert in international affairs and who got made up and sat in the green room every night for months on the off chance that a guest didn‚Äôt show. Other regulars included Philip Brady, a great Australian entertainer and one of the pioneers of Australian television, appeared on Tonight Live almost weekly in the first year because he made Vizard laugh. Glenn Robbins, Steve Bedwell and many others appeared regularly.  Impact and controversy  Tonight Live was a substantial ratings and revenue success for the Seven Network at a time when the Network was in difficulty and had just gone into receivership. The show extended prime time revenues into late night and generated substantial revenues for the Network.Tonight Live dominated the ratings around Australia in every year of its broadcast. For the year 1990, the Nielsen ratings surveys reported that Tonight Live gained an average viewer share of 42.6% of viewers in all households in Australia (nearly double Channel 9 at 26% and Network 10 at 20%). In 1991 it won with an average share of 35%. In 1992, it won with an average share of 32.24%. In 1993, it won with an average share of 31.22%. Tonight Live was originally commissioned to take on the dominating late night show on its competitor Nine Network, Graham Kennedy‚Äôs Coast to Coast at 10.30pm Monday to Friday. Coast to Coast was co-hosted by journalist John Mangos who had replaced previous co-host Ken Sutcliffe. When Seven announced they were putting up Tonight Live against Coast to Coast, Kennedy announced that he would not be continuing the next year. In later years, Tonight Live featured a Friday night guest host, usually Richard Stubbs. Vizard enjoyed taking nights off and more than 100 guest hosts were tried including Agro, Ben Elton, Bob Geldof, Paula Yates, Ronnie Corbett, Glenn Robbins and John Singleton. In the last two years of the show, up to two nights per week were pretaped. This became the subject of complaints (similar claims about broadcast such as sports events being 'live' despite being taped and broadcast hours later are often made on Australian television). At one point the show's broadcast carried a message disclaiming that the show was 'live'. Tonight Live was broadcast live from the Seven studios on Dorcas Street, South Melbourne, Victoria, Studios numbered 7 and 8. Shows produced from there include, Dancing With The Stars, Rove, The Bert Newton Show and Blue Heelers. After Tonight Live finished, the set from Tonight Live was donated to RMITV with which to produce television shows for C31. Owing to a critical lack of resources at C31, the set elements have been reused and repainted for many shows over many years and are still in frequent use many years after Tonight Live went off the air.

Grant Memorial is a presidential memorial in Washington, D.C., honoring American Civil War general and 18th United States President Ulysses S. Grant. It sits at the base of Capitol Hill (Union Square, the Mall, 1st Street, between Pennsylvania Avenue and Maryland Avenue), below the west front of the United States Capitol. Its central sculpture of Grant on horseback faces west, overlooking the Capitol Reflecting Pool and facing toward the Lincoln Memorial, which honors Grant's wartime president, Abraham Lincoln. Grant's statue is raised on a pedestal decorated with bronze reliefs of the infantry; flanking pedestals hold statues of protective lions and bronze representations of the Union cavalry and artillery. The whole is connected with marble covered platforms, balustrades, and stairs. The Grant and Lincoln memorials define the eastern and western ends, respectively, of the National Mall. The Grant Memorial is a contributor to the Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C., of the National Register of Historic Places. James M. Goode's authoritative The Grant Memorial in Washington, D.C. (1974) called it \\"one of the most important sculptures in Washington.\\"Goode 1974, p.244. It includes the second-largest equestrian statue in the United States and the fifth-largest in the world.Larger ones include the statue of conquistador Don Juan de O√±ate in El Paso, Texas; the Genghis Khan Equestrian Statue; the monument to Italy's King Victor Emanuel in Rome and the monument of Jan ≈Ωi≈æka in Prague. Description The central, equestrian statue of Grant with one of the four lions (2017)The Grant Memorial is in Union Square, which also encompasses the Capitol Reflecting Pool. The platform for the Monument, made of Vermont marble, is long and wide and is divided into three sections. The tall, middle section features a 10,700-pound, high equestrian statue depicting Grant astride his war horse Cincinnati on a 22¬Ω-foot high marble pedestal. A striking feature of the central statue is Grant's calm (almost disaffected) attitude amidst the raging fighting going on around him. This is not surprising because Grant was known for his calmness and coolheadedness during battle. In sharp contrast to Grant are the sculpture groups on either side, Cavalry Charge and Artillery, which > ... possess more dramatic interest and suspense than any sculpture in the > city and, indeed, in the Nation.Goode 1974, p.246. Surrounding the main pedestal are four shorter pedestals, each supporting a bronze lion in repose guarding both the United States flag and the flags of the Army. The memorial was the largest bronze sculpture cast in the United States at that time. The Artillery Group to the south shows a caisson carrying three artillerymen and pulled by three horses. Astride the horse on the left is the guidon (flag) carrier who is signaling a sharp right wheel. Despite the impending course change the horse on the right is able to continue lunging forward due to a broken strap on the right bridle bit. To the north the Cavalry Group depicts a color squad consisting of seven cavalrymen charging into battle. The horse on the right has fallen and the rider, modeled after Shrady himself, is moments from being trampled by the onrushing horses. History The drive to erect a monument to Grant was begun in the 1890s by the Society of the Army of the Tennessee.Sherrill 1924, p. 18. Work on the memorial was begun in 1902 as the largest ever commissioned by Congress at the time, was created by sculptor Henry Merwin Shrady and architect Edward Pearce Casey.Goode 1974, p.243. Sculptor Edmond Amateis assisted Shrady as the monument neared completion in 1921.Montagna 1987, p.55. Shrady spent 20 years of his life working on the memorial and died, stressed and overworked, two weeks before its dedication in 1922.Goode 1974, p.245. The sculptures were cast in bronze at the Roman Bronze Works in New York. Construction on the site of the memorial began in 1909 when the marble superstructure and the four bronze lions were installed. The Artillery Group was installed in 1912, the Cavalry Group in 1916, and the bronze equestrian statue of Grant in 1920. The memorial was dedicated on the 100th anniversary of Grant's birth, April 27, 1922. Shrady having died, the infantry panels on the base of Grant's pedestal were completed by sculptor Sherry Fry based on Shrady's sketches and installed in 1924.Montagna 1987, p.59. The Grant Memorial composes the center of a three-part sculptural group including the James A. Garfield Monument to the south and the Peace Monument to the north. During 2015 and 2016 a cleaning and restoration program was carried out on the memorial. This included the replacement of 150 elements of the work, such as swords and scabbards, that had gone missing or been stolen over the years. The layer of green corrosion on the memorial's bronze was removed to return it to its original brown color.

She was also a professor at l'Ecole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne, Switzerland. She is best known for coining the term elisionism in her 1995 book Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach. On 14 April 2014, Archer was named by Pope Francis to succeed former Harvard law professor and US Ambassador to the Holy See Mary Ann Glendon as President of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, and served in this position until her retirement on 27 March 2019. Life Archer studied at the University of London, graduating BSc in 1964 and PhD in 1967 with a thesis on The Educational Aspirations of English Working Class Parents. She was a lecturer at the University of Reading from 1966 to 1973. She is one of the most influential theorists in the critical realist tradition. At the 12th World Congress of Sociology, she was elected as the first female President and the 11th president of the International Sociological Association (1986‚Äì1990), is a founding member of both the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences and the Academy of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences. She is a trustee of the Centre for Critical Realism. She has supervised some PhD students, some of whom have gone on to contribute towards the substantive development of critical realism in the social sciences, including Robert Willmott, author of Education Policy and Realist Social Theory, Sean Creaven, author of Marxism and Realism, and Justin Cruickshank, author of Realism and Sociology.  Analytical dualism  Archer argues that much social theory suffers from the generic defect of conflation where, due to a reluctance or inability to theorize emergent relationships between social phenomena, causal autonomy is denied to one side of the relation. This can take the form of autonomy being denied to agency with causal efficacy only granted to structure (downwards conflation). Alternatively it can take the form of autonomy being denied to structure with causal efficacy only granted to agency (upwards conflation). Finally it may take the form of central conflation where structure and agency are seen as being co-constitutive i.e. structure is reproduced through agency which is simultaneously constrained and enabled by structure. The most prominent example of central conflation is the structuration theory of Anthony Giddens. While not objecting to this approach on philosophical grounds, Archer does object to it on analytical grounds: by conflating structure and agency into unspecified movements of co-constitution, central conflationary approaches preclude the possibility of sociological exploration of the relative influence of each aspect. In contradistinction Archer offers the approach of analytical dualism.M.S. Archer (1995) Realist Social Theory ch 3 to 6 While recognizing the interdependence of structure and agency (i.e. without people there would be no structures) she argues that they operate on different timescales. At any particular moment, antecedently existing structures constrain and enable agents, whose interactions produce intended and unintended consequences, which leads to structural elaboration and the reproduction or transformation of the initial structure. The resulting structure then provides a similar context of action for future agents. Likewise the initial antecedently existing structure was itself the outcome of structural elaboration resulting from the action of prior agents. So while structure and agency are interdependent, Archer argues that it is possible to unpick them analytically. By isolating structural and/or cultural factors which provide a context of action for agents, it is possible to investigate how those factors shape the subsequent interactions of agents and how those interactions in turn reproduce or transform the initial context. Archer calls this a morphogenetic sequence. Social processes are constituted through an endless array of such sequences but, as a consequence of their temporal ordering, it is possible to disengage any such sequence in order to investigate its internal causal dynamics. Through doing so, argues Archer, it is possible to give empirical accounts of how structural and agential phenomena interlink over time rather than merely stating their theoretical interdependence.  Controversy  In an interview with Bloomberg, Archer discussed the attendance of US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders at a conference of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences that she had organized. Archer accused Sanders of a \\"monumental discourtesy\\", claiming he sought to politicize his attendance after having lobbied for an invitation to the conference, failing to notify her office. Marcelo S√°nchez Sorondo, the Chancellor of the academy, and senior to Archer, took issue with Archer's version of events. After repeatedly refusing to tell a Bloomberg reporter which party had initiated contact, S√°nchez Sorondo insisted that proper protocol had been followed in issuing the invitation: \\"This is not true and she knows it. I invited him with her consensus.\\" The invitation in question bore his signature as well as Archer's name (but not her signature) and stated that S√°nchez Sorondo was inviting Sanders \\"on behalf of\\" Archer.

Emdur is currently co-host of The Morning Show alongside Kylie Gillies.https://au.tv.yahoo.com/the-morning-show/about/ The duo also hosted the Australian version of Celebrity Splash!. He formerly hosted the Australian version of game show The Price Is Right from 1993 to 1998 and later 2003 to 2005 on the Nine Network and then again when the show returned to the Seven Network on 7 May 2012. The show was cancelled later that year. He is known to Australian audiences for his hosting duties on several other game shows, including Cash Bonanza (Nine Network), and Wheel of Fortune (Seven Network). Emdur hosted Hey Hey it's Saturday five times, once in 1994, twice in 1998, and twice, back to back, in 1999, and substituted as host of It Takes Two once in 2006 and again in 2007. He has also hosted Celebrity Dog School on Network Ten. Childhood and early career Growing up near the beach in Bondi, New South Wales, Emdur developed a keen interest in surfing from an early age. Dropping out of school at age 15, Emdur began his career as a copyboy at The Sydney Morning Herald, before moving into television, where at age 17 he became Australia's youngest national newsreader, presenting the overnight news for Seven Network in Australia. After some time in news and current affairs as a reporter and newsreader, and presenter on Good Morning Australia, Emdur switched to hosting game shows and variety television. TV career Emdur is known as the host of The Price Is Right on the Nine Network, which he hosted from 1993 to 1998, before its cancellation. It was then revived on 23 June 2003 and ran until 24 November 2005 due to poor ratings and high costs of production. To commemorate the United States version's 40th season in 2011‚Äì12, on a July 2011 trip to the United States, Emdur called down a contestant and served as a guest host for Cliff Hangers, under recommendation of host Drew Carey. Emdur also modeled a trip to Australia in one of the two Showcases that are presented on the United States version. Emdur was one of numerous hosts who have hosted the format to appear as part of the 40th anniversary celebration.Larry's Still Got the Goods After All These Years, Herald Sun. Emdur filled in for Daryl Somers on the family show Hey Hey It's Saturday. After being \\"rested\\" by the Nine Network following the cancellation of The Price Is Right, Emdur became host of the Seven Network's Wheel of Fortune. His contract with Seven was signed mere hours after his deal with the Nine Network expired. While in the first few weeks of his run with Seven's Wheel in the weekday timeslot, Emdur continued to appear simultaneously on Nine in re-runs of The Price Is Right, until Bert's Family Feud took over the timeslot on Nine in mid-February 2006. On 19 June 2006, news emerged of Wheel of Fortune's cancellation at the end of the 2006 season. Channel 10's Rove Live then started a campaign to \\"Save Larry Emdur\\", although Seven soon put an end to Rove's jokes by issuing a statement that Emdur would be staying with the Seven Network. Emdur has also been a fill-in host for It Takes Two and has filled in for Andrew O'Keefe on Weekend Sunrise and David Koch on Sunrise. Emdur signed up with Network Ten in 2007. He had joined up to host a new show Celebrity Dog School, which began airing in February. Emdur is currently co-hosting The Morning Show with Kylie Gillies, a morning talk show airing on the Seven Network. The show began in mid-2007. Emdur was invited to participate in the 2009 Sydney to Hobart by finance commentator Anthony Bell. Upon reaching Hobart, Emdur said on The Morning Show that he may never set foot on a boat again. However, in 2010 Emdur signed on to participate in the Sydney to Hobart again. His crew on the yacht 'Investec LOYAL' finished second. On 4 February 2011, Emdur renewed his contract with the Seven Network, reportedly worth in excess of $800,000 a year. This contract stopped him from defecting to the Nine Network to co-host Today. The contract allows him to stay on as co-host of The Morning Show and 'other opportunities'. In February 2010, Seven announced that Emdur would co-host Weekend Sunrise on Saturday mornings alongside Samantha Armytage, and he held this position until the end of 2010. Emdur is also currently a regular fill in co-host for David Koch on Sunrise and Matt Doran on Weekend Sunrise if they are away on holidays, sick or on assignment. In September 2013, Emdur produced and hosted a pilot for a late night talk show titled Larry on Late in Sydney, which featured guests Guy Sebastian, Samantha Armytage and Manon Youdale. Seven Network passed on the show after viewing the pilot.http://www.nsi.tafensw.edu.au/About/News/Item.aspx?NewsId=252 In December 2013, Emdur was a crew member aboard racing supermaxi yacht Perpetual Loyal in the 2013 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, with his other celebrity crew members, Karl Stefanovic, Guillaume Brahimi, Tom Slingsby, Phil Waugh and Jude Bolton. In 2014, Emdur and co-host of The Morning Show, Kylie Gillies, whose studio is across from the Sydney Lindt Cafe, were able to view and report on the events of the Martin Place siege, as it unfolded, before transmission handed over to the Seven Network Melbourne studios.

It is thought that it was Rtischev who instigated the revision of service-books which led to the Great Schism of the Russian Orthodox Church. Some scholars also hold him responsible for the eventual downfall of Patriarch Nikon. During the great famine in Vologda (1650), Rtischev sold much of his property, including clothes and house utensils, in order to raise funds for the famine-stricken city. He took care for all the wounded in the Russo-Polish wars, notwithstanding their nationality, and established several alms-houses in Moscow. Remembered as the earliest patron of Russian education, Rtischev founded one of the first schools in Moscow, where he invited Yepifany Slavinetsky to instruct the students in Greek language. Rtischev's school would later be transformed into the Slavic Greek Latin Academy. It is known that Rtischev survived several assassination attempts, and wrote a treatise on falconry.Brockhaus and Efron Dictionary His biography was written by Vasily Klyuchevsky.

Life Perrone was born in Chieri, Piedmont. After studying theology and obtaining the doctorate at Turin, he entered the Society of Jesus in Rome at age 21, on 14 December 1815. The Society had been re-established by Pope Pius VII only a year before, and Perrone was very soon appointed to teach theology at Orvieto. In 1823 he was made professor of dogmatic theology at the Roman College. In 1830 he was made rector of the Jesuit college in Ferrara, from which he returned to his teaching work in Rome. The Roman Republic of 1849 forced him to seek refuge in England. After an exile of three years, Perrone again took the chair of dogma in the Roman College, being made head of his former college in 1850. He taught theology till prevented by old age. He was consultor of various congregations and was active in opposing some teachings of George Hermes as well as the discussions which ended in 1854 in the dogmatic definition of the Immaculate Conception (cf. \\"Annali delli scienze religiose\\", VII). From 1869 he was prominent on the Ultramontane side at Vatican Council I. Of Perrone's many writings the most important is the \\"Pr√¶lectiones Theologic√¶\\", which reached a thirty-fourth edition in nine volumes. The compendium which Perrone made of this work reached forty-seven editions in two volumes. His complete theological lectures were published in French and ran through several editions; portions were translated into Spanish, Polish, German, Dutch, and other languages. Sommervogel mentions forty-four different works of Perrone, who taught alongside Passaglia and Franzelin in the Roman College. His numerous dogmatic works are characteristic of the Roman theology of the time. They include Praelectiones theologicae, quas in Collegio Romano S.J. habebat Joannes Perrone (9 vols., Rome, 1835 sqq.), Praelectiones hierologicae in compendium redactae (4 vols., Rome, 1845), Il Hermesianismo (Rome, 1838), Il Protestantismo e la regola di fede (3 vols., 1853), and De divinitate D.

The first game based on the series was released for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum by Elite Systems in 1984. The game also was released on the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and Atari 8-bit family. A sequel, Airwolf II, was released in 1986. An arcade game based on the series was developed by Kyugo and released in 1987. A Famicom port of this game was released in 1988. Kyugo also developed a Sega Genesis game based on the series, called Super Airwolf. In the US, this game was released as CrossFire without the Airwolf license or theme song. This was not the first CrossFire game from Kyugo. They had previously developed a CrossFire game for the Famicom, which was an action platformer. This game was going to be released in the US, but the release was cancelled. The NES version was not a port of the arcade game, but was instead developed by Beam Software and released by Acclaim in 1988. The game places the player in the cockpit of the Airwolf helicopter attempting to shoot down enemy aircraft and rescue prisoners. Gameplay (NES game) The game contains thirty missions, each with the objective being to rescue prisoners being held captive in enemy bases. The layout of each level changes as the player progresses. There are three types of bases: *Home base - This is where the player can refuel the Airwolf and repair damage it may have taken. *Enemy airfield - This is where many of the enemy craft take off from. The base can be destroyed, which lessens the number of enemy aircraft pursuing the player. *Prisoner base - This is where the prisoners are being held. To rescue them, the player must successfully land Airwolf and rescue the prisoner. Airwolf is equipped with missiles and a machine gun in order to fend off enemy craft and their weapons. In order to successfully complete a mission, the player must rescue all prisoners and reach the border of the level without losing all of their lives. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Airwolf on their November 1, 1987 issue as being the fourteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

In 15 starts, S√°nchez posted a 3‚Äì4 record with a 1.77 earned run average (ERA), and by the end of the year was widely considered one of Boston's top pitching prospects. After the 2004 season, Baseball America named S√°nchez Boston's fifth-best prospect, behind shortstop Hanley Ram√≠rez, outfielder Brandon Moss, and pitchers Jonathan Papelbon and Jon Lester. By 2006, Ram√≠rez, Papelbon, and Lester had all played in the majors; Moss was selected as the Portland Sea Dogs most valuable player in 2006. 2005 saw the young prospect starting the season off in Wilmington, Boston's High-A ball affiliate. After posting a 6‚Äì1 record with a 2.40 ERA, receiving a selection for the All-Star Futures Game, and making the Carolina League All-Star team, he was promoted to the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs. S√°nchez got off to a hot start there, but tired toward the end of the season, creating some concern about his durability. Still, S√°nchez put up a 3.45 ERA over 11 starts in his first year in Double-A; at 21 years old, he was still one of the youngest players in his league. =Florida Marlins= S√°nchez with the Miami Marlins in 2012 At the end of the 2005 season, Boston traded S√°nchez along with Hanley Ram√≠rez, Jes√∫s Delgado, and Harvey Garc√≠a to the Florida Marlins, in the same transaction that brought Josh Beckett, Guillermo Mota, and Mike Lowell to the Red Sox. In addition to Beckett and Lowell, the Marlins traded several of their other star players after the 2005 season, including Carlos Delgado, Juan Pierre, Paul Lo Duca, and Luis Castillo, for mainly minor-league prospects. Baseball America ranked S√°nchez third in the Marlins system (after Jeremy Hermida and Ramirez) and 40th overall in the major leagues at the start of the 2006 season. The Marlins started six rookies in their Opening Day lineup in 2006, but elected to have S√°nchez return to Class AA to start the season with the Carolina Mudcats. S√°nchez made his first 15 starts in 2006 with Mudcats, for whom he posted a 3‚Äì6 record with a 3.15 ERA. While with Carolina, he pitched two complete games, one of which was a seven-hit shutout. On June 25, he was called up to the majors to start the second half of a doubleheader in Yankee Stadium against the Yankees. S√°nchez's major league debut was a strong one, as he allowed seven hits and no runs in 5 innings against the Yankees. He then turned the game over to his bullpen, which blanked the Yankees the rest of the way, shutting out the Yankees for the first time all year, 5‚Äì0. S√°nchez became just the second visiting starter in the past decade to win his big-league debut at Yankee Stadium (fellow Venezuelan Gustavo Chac√≠n of the Toronto Blue Jays, who beat the Yankees in September 2004, is the other). On July 14, the 22-year-old S√°nchez started against and defeated Houston Astros pitcher Roger Clemens, who made his MLB debut when S√°nchez was just three months old. On September 6, 2006, S√°nchez no-hit the Arizona Diamondbacks 2‚Äì0 at Dolphin Stadium. He walked four batters and struck out six, throwing 103 pitches. The Marlins, who used 21 rookies during the 2006 season, started six in S√°nchez's no-hitter, setting the record for most rookies to play for the winning team in a no-hitter. S√°nchez's no-hitter against Arizona ended the longest no-hitter drought in Major League Baseball history; there had been 6,364 consecutive major-league games without a no-hitter since Randy Johnson's perfect game on May 18, 2004. The previous record was a 4,015-game streak without a no-hitter, which lasted from September 30, 1984, to September 19, 1986. On the same night that S√°nchez recorded his no-hitter, Johnson nearly pitched another one, taking a no-hitter into the seventh inning for the New York Yankees against the Kansas City Royals. S√°nchez became the 19th rookie pitcher since 1900 to pitch a no-hitter, and the first since Bud Smith of the St. Louis Cardinals no-hit the San Diego Padres on September 3, 2001. His no-hitter was also the fourth no-hitter in Marlins history, after Al Leiter, Kevin Brown, and A. J. Burnett. S√°nchez became the second Venezuelan pitcher to pitch a no-hitter in the major leagues, joining Wilson √Ålvarez, who pitched a no-hitter with the Chicago White Sox against the Baltimore Orioles on August 11, 1991. On September 27, S√°nchez earned his tenth win against the Cincinnati Reds, joining teammates Josh Johnson, Scott Olsen, and Ricky Nolasco in the first set of four rookie teammates in MLB history to record ten or more wins in their rookie seasons. Marlins left-hander Dontrelle Willis had a record of 12‚Äì12, so with S√°nchez's tenth win, the Marlins had their first set of five pitchers with ten or more wins in franchise history. He finished his first season with the Marlins with a record of 10‚Äì3 and an ERA of 2.83 in 18 major- league games (17 starts). Before their game against the Philadelphia Phillies on September 30, the Marlins presented S√°nchez with the pitching rubber and home plate used in his no-hitter. The Miami-Dade County Office of the Mayor and Board of County Commissioners officially named September 30, 2006, An√≠bal S√°nchez Day. 2007 S√°nchez suffered shoulder problems during spring training but still started 2007 with the Marlins, going 2‚Äì1 with a 4.80 ERA in six starts. When reliever Jorge Julio returned to the team from the disabled list on May 4, the Marlins demoted S√°nchez to Class AAA Albuquerque, citing his struggles with control. On June 21, it was reported that his season was over after having Dr. James Andrews perform surgery to repair a tear in his labrum. 2008 On July 31, 2008, S√°nchez pitched his first Major League game in almost 15 months against the Colorado Rockies. He had a solid outing and pitched 5 innings while giving up two runs on six hits and striking out four. The Marlins went on to win that game 12‚Äì2, with S√°nchez collecting his first win of the season. 2009‚Äì2010 Another shortened season limited S√°nchez to 16 starts in 2009, but he saw improvements in his stats, finishing with a 3.87 ERA and his lowest WHIP and opponent's batting average since his rookie year. 2010 saw S√°nchez finally get through a whole season, as he was the only Marlins' starter to stay in the starting rotation for the entire season. He set a career high in wins with 13, with a still-declining ERA of 3.55 and 195 innings pitched. 2011 On April 22, he took another no- hitter into the ninth inning against the Colorado Rockies before giving up a hit to Dexter Fowler. S√°nchez finished the game for his fourth career complete game. Three starts later, S√°nchez again took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the Washington Nationals before losing it. S√°nchez would also throw another complete game on May 26 against the San Francisco Giants, a 1‚Äì0 win that gave S√°nchez his third career shutout. S√°nchez would throw a one- hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates, his fourth career shutout and second of the season, in early September. After starting the season 6‚Äì2, a lack of run support and injuries from the rest of the team led resulted in a 2‚Äì7 finish to the season. 2012 An√≠bal made 19 starts for the Miami Marlins in 2012, compiling a 5‚Äì7 record with a 3.94 ERA. =Detroit Tigers= Rest of 2012 Detroit Tigers in 2012 On July 23, 2012, S√°nchez was traded to the Detroit Tigers along with Omar Infante for Jacob Turner, Rob Brantly, Brian Flynn and a draft pick.Frisaro, Joe and Tom Green.

The injury was later diagnosed as a strained pectoral muscle, sending S√°nchez to the disabled list for the second time this season. 2015 S√°nchez began 2015 as the Tigers' #2 starter, due to the offseason loss of Max Scherzer and an injury to Justin Verlander. He had a rough start to the 2015 season, surrendering 13 home runs through his first 12 starts (after giving up just four homers in 22 games during the 2014 season). He showed signs of turning the season around in June, allowing zero runs in back-to-back starts against the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds.

An√≠bal is known for keeping hitters off-balance with his willingness to throw any pitch at any time in the count. Baseball writer Mike Axisa stated in 2013, \\"Rotation mates Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander overpower hitters.

Gunman Chronicles was originally a Quake deathmatch mod named Gunmanship 101, then it was moved to Quake II's engine before becoming a Half-Life mod. The game was popular at the Half-Life Mod Expo in 1999, and Sierra approached Rewolf to make a retail version. After significant work and with some office space, funding, and added staff, it was released as a standalone game. Plans were drawn to release Gunman Chronicles on GameCube, but it was never released.  Gameplay  Gunman Chronicles is a first-person shooter that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game, much like its predecessor Half- Life. While gameplay is similar to Half-Life's in terms of health-and-armor systems and artificial intelligence, one major aspect of Gunman Chronicles is the ability to customize each weapon. Each weapon the player obtains has multiple alternate \\"modes\\" for various situations; for instance, the starting pistol can be turned into a sniper rifle or a rapid-fire machine-pistol while the MULE, a rocket launcher, can be configured to fire homing rockets, timed explosives, or cluster bombs. Another new aspect of Gunman Chronicles is the ability to drive vehicles. During the latter half of the game, there is a lengthy vehicle section in which the player is able to drive a tank through a system of canyons. The player occasionally comes across obstacles hindering the tank's path which will require the player to stop and figure out a puzzle or activate a switch. The game features a wide variety of enemies, including rogue Gunmen-turned-bandits, giant dinosaurs, genetically-modified aliens called Xenomes, and robotic attack drones. Bandits will roll around to dodge fire while returning fire with dual pistols or rifles, while Xenomes will charge at the player in packs with reckless abandon and release homing projectiles upon death. Similar to Half-Life, certain objects such as vases and crates can be destroyed to provide ammunition, health, and armor. Unlike Half-Life however, armor takes the form of actual vests, and can not be replenished by chargers like health can. Unlike Half-Life and its expansions, Gunman Chronicles, however sparsely, uses cutscenes to tell key parts of the storyline. These usually appear only as transitions between different worlds and levels however, and thus most of the plot is seen through the eyes of the player like in Half-Life.  Synopsis  = Setting = According to the game's introductory cutscene, the Gunmen act as a sort of military police force for humanity's inter-galactically expanding colonial empire at an unknown time period in the distant future. During a mission five years prior to the beginning of the game, the Gunmen were dispatched to a planet called Banzure Prime to investigate a communications breakdown with a research colony there, under the command of their leader, known simply as \\"The General\\". While investigating the colony, they come under attack by massive, worm-like organisms that form one part of a larger genus of creatures known as \\"Xenomes\\". The General, seeing his men have no chance by themselves, takes command of one of the Gunmen's dropships and begins performing bombing runs on the attacking Xenomes, destroying several before being captured in the jaws of one of the larger creatures. Meanwhile, the player character, Major Archer, rallies the remaining gunmen and orders them to retreat to the remaining ships and get off-world immediately, assuming that the general is already dead. The General, still alive as his fighter is dragged underground, pleads (apparently unheard) for rescue over the radio, but the Gunmen leave before having a chance to receive the message. = Plot = Five years later, the game places the player in direct control of Major Archer, preparing for a mission aboard the Gunman space station Aeronautica. After a training level, Archer and a small detachment of Gunmen are deployed to a dinosaur- inhabited jungle planet, under orders to investigate an outdated but extremely high ranking Gunman distress signal. The signal is revealed to be a trap, and the Gunmen come under heavy attack both from unidentified human forces and the indigenous fauna. The player is eventually forced to fight his way through a series of catacombs, where he encounters the General, still alive despite having been eaten alive on Banzure Prime. He reveals to Archer that the silicon-based Xenomes are incapable of digesting carbon-based humans, and that he, the scientists from the research colony, and the other Gunmen consumed by the Xenomes managed to fight their way out of the creature's gullets after Archer left them for dead. The vengeful scientists and Gunmen have now formed a rogue cell, with the General as its leader, and are engineering new Xenome breeds to use as weapons and to exact their vengeance upon Archer. The General allows Archer to leave, so as to watch him die at the hands of the planet's vicious reptiles, but he manages to infiltrate the General's cargo ship, bound for a falling moon that plays host to an outdated AI, called the Mainframe, that has been unstable for some time since the General left it. At the moon, the ship comes under fire from the now fully insane AI's drones. The General dumps the cargo module Archer is hiding in in order to gain speed and leaves the AI facility's science team behind to die. As Archer progresses through the facility, he learns that the Mainframe's primary battle is with a major Xenome infestation that the humans brought onto the moon. Fighting both attack drones and Xenomes alike, Archer makes his way through the facility. Despite the Mainframe's best efforts, Archer manages to destroy most of the \\"kata-space anchors\\" that keep the moon from falling to the planet below. Archer survives the destruction of the anchors, but is stranded on the falling moon. Archer eventually finds the Mainframe and they form an uneasy alliance: the Mainframe will provide an aerial drone for Major Archer to escape in, but only if he takes the Mainframe's core with him. Major Archer agrees, and they battle through hordes of Xenome forces with the help of the Mainframe's attack drones. Major Archer and the AI successfully reach and board the aerial drone, but fail to navigate through an asteroid field on their way into kata-space and crash land on a desert planet called Icnus, encountering and fighting rogue Gunmen. Icnus turns out to be the location of the General's main Xenome facility. Archer battles his way through the facility with the help of the Mainframe, accidentally causing a captured Worm Xenome, one of the most dangerous Xenomes in existence, to break loose. The Mainframe helps Archer to the General's location and they engage in a firefight, where the AI's newly constructed Super Drone defeats the General's Kata-Drone. The General bails out but is immediately attacked by the escaped Worm Xenome, which comes out of a crevice and consumes him once again. The Mainframe states its intention to make the Xenome facility its home as it calls for backup, and Gunman reinforcements arrive shortly after to contain the Xenome infestation and capture any remaining rogue Gunmen.  Rewolf Software  Rewolf Software logo Rewolf Software, also known as Rewolf Entertainment, was a game development studio established in Utah by Herbert Flower (also known as Herb Flower) in 1996. The development team came from the mod scene and was put together for the duration of one project, which was Gunman Chronicles. After Gunman Chronicles was shipped, Rewolf Entertainment dissolved and its team members moved on to new ventures. A couple of months later, in 2001, Herbert Flower co-founded Mythyn Interactive together with Paul Witte, while the core team on Gunman, consisting of Stefan Baier, Renier Banninga, and Adrian Banninga, moved to the Netherlands, where they co-founded Streamline Studios together with Alexander L. Fernandez.  Reception  Jim Preston reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"A respectable mod that's still no better than some of the free stuff out there.\\" The game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

It is a twin-engined development of the Myasishchev M-17 Stratosphera with a higher maximum take-off weight. Design and development During the 1950s and 1960s the United States instituted several programs using high-altitude reconnaissance balloons, released over friendly territory to ascend into the jetstream and be transported over the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China.Taylor, Michael J. H. Brassey's World Aircraft & Systems Directory 1999‚Äì2000, 2000. , p. 157. Subject 34 To combat these high-altitude balloons, Myasishchev proposed Subject 34 a single- seat turbojet-powered twin-boom high-aspect-ratio aircraft, nicknamed Chaika (\\"Seagull\\" in Russian) due to its anhedral wing design. Armament of the single-seat balloon interceptor was to have been two air-air missiles (AAM) and two GSh-23 cannon with 600rpg in a dorsal turret. Before Subject 34 could be developed into operational hardware, the threat receded due to the success of the Keyhole reconnaissance satellites of the Corona program and the emergence of the Lockheed A-12. The first prototype of Subject 34 was completed in secret at the Kumertau helicopter plant in Bashkirya, but whilst carrying out taxi tests, in December 1978 piloted by K. V. Chernobrovkin, the prototype Chaika lifted off to avoid hitting snow banks and was destroyed after hitting a hillside in zero visibility. M-17 Stratosphera The design of the Chaika was adapted as a reconnaissance aircraft and emerged as the Myasishchev M-17 Stratosphera with a revised airframe, including straight tapered wings with 2¬∞ 30' anhedral (0¬∞ at 1g), shorter fuselage pod and unreheated Kolesov RD-36-51 turbojet engine. Flown for the first time on 26 May 1982, the M-17 prototype (regn CCCP 17401) was soon allocated the NATO reporting name Mystic-A and was used for investigating the Ozone layer over Antarctica in 1992. The M-17 also set a total of 12 FAI world records, 5 of which still stand. On 28 March 1990, M-17 CCCP 17401 piloted by Vladimir V. Arkhipenko set an altitude record of in class C-1i (Landplanes: take-off weight 16 000 to 20 000 kg). M-55 Geophysica M-55 The M-17 balloon- interceptor-based model was terminated in 1987 and replaced by the M-17RN, later known as the M-55 Geophysica, which was dubbed by NATO Mystic-B. First flown on 16 Aug 1988, the M-55 airframe was revised further with a longer fuselage pod, housing two Soloviev D-30-10V un-reheated turbofan engines, shorter-span wings and comprehensive sensor payload. The M-55 set a total of 15 FAI world records, all of which still stand today: On 21 September 1993, an M-55 piloted by Victor Vasenkov from the 8th State R&D; Institute of the Air Force named after V. P. Chkalov at Akhtubinsk reached a class record altitude of in class C-1j (Landplanes: take-off weight ). A dual-control version, the M-55UTS, was developed by adding a second cockpit behind the original, displacing some avionics and/or sensor payload. A number of M-55 Geophysica remain in service, performing in research roles; one M-55 took part in a study of the Arctic stratosphere in 1996‚Äì1997, with similar experiments performed in Antarctica during 1999.Airborne Polar Experiment ‚Äì Geophysics Aircraft In Antarctica (APE-GAIA) . An Irish-headquartered company Qucomhaps, with a focus on South East Asia, has entered a 1-billion USD deal to use the M-55 as a high-altitude platform station for digital communications.

Fix (10 May 1939 ‚Äì 10 March 2002) was an American mathematician who collaborated on several seminal papers and books in the field of finite element method. In addition to his work in mathematics, Fix was a beer and homebrewing enthusiast and educator, as well as the author of several books about brewing. He died of cancer in 2002. Education Fix was born and grew up in Dallas, Texas, and attended Texas A&M; University on a baseball scholarship, where he earned a Bachelor of Science. He received his Master of Science degree from Rice University, and in 1968, he earned a Ph.D from Harvard. Professor of mathematics After earning his Ph.D, Fix stayed at Harvard as an assistant professor until 1972. While there, he met Gilbert Strang, and collaborated with him on a paper regarding the Fourier analysis of finite element methods (FEM). In 1973, he and Strang published An Analysis of the Finite Element Method, a book that gave the latest advances in FEM \\"publicity and respectability\\". (Max Gunzburger of Iowa State University called it \\"one of the most important and influential applied mathematics books ever published.\\") Fix moved to University of Maryland in 1972, and then to University of Michigan. He served as the chair of mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University for over 20 years, and served in the same role at University of Texas at Arlington and Clemson University. He also taught at University of Bonn. During his academic tenure, he published two books and over 100 papers. In addition to his seminal work on FEM, his papers included works on iterative methods, grid generation, and integral equations in the context of FEM. He also made contributions concerning numerical applications of real-world applications, including solid mechanics, acoustics, and jets and sprays, as well as computational geometry as it applied to the modeling of developable surfaces. Contributions to brewing Fix also applied his talents to amateur beer brewing. He won hundreds of awards across the United States for his beers, and was named Homebrewer of the Year in 1981 by the American Homebrewers Association (AHA). He was a consultant to numerous microbreweries and brewpubs, and served as an expert witness in brewing-related litigation. He served on the Board of Advisors of the AHA, the editorial board of Brewing Techniques magazine, the steering committee of the Masters Championship of Amateur Brewing, and was a member of Beer Judge Certification Program, the American Association of Brewing Chemists, and the Master Brewers Association of America. In 1999, he wrote Principles of Brewing Science, considered a standard reference for home- and craft-brewers. He also co-authored two books about homebrewing with his wife Laurie, including An Analysis of Brewing Techniques in 1998. For his achievements and role as an educator in the field of home brewing, Fix was honoured with the AHA Recognition Award in 1991, the Distinguished Service Recognition Award by the Association of Brewers in 1991, and the Ninkasi Award by the AHA in 1997.

The square lies at the outbound end of Andr√°ssy Avenue next to City Park (V√°rosliget). It hosts the Museum of Fine Arts and the M≈±csarnok. The square has played an important part in contemporary Hungarian history and has been a host to many political events, such as the reburial of Imre Nagy in 1989. The sculptures were made by sculptor Zala Gy√∂rgy from Lendava.  Site  The Millennium Underground is the first underground (Metro) system in continental Europe.https://www.bkv.hu/en/the_history_of_bkv/the_history_of_bkv_part_1/ The end of the tunnel behind the Heroes' square, (Photo from 1896) H≈ës√∂k tere is surrounded by two important buildings, Museum of Fine Arts on the left and Palace of Art (or more accurately Hall of Art) on the right. On the other side it faces Andr√°ssy Avenue which has two buildings looking at the square ‚Äì one is residential and the other one is the embassy of Serbia (former Yugoslavian embassy where Imre Nagy secured sanctuary in 1956). The central feature of Heroes' Square, as well as a landmark of Budapest, is the Millennium Memorial (, also translated Millennium Monument or Millennial Monument). Construction began in 1896 to commemorate the thousandth anniversary of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin and the foundation of the Hungarian state in 1896, and was part of a much larger construction project which also included the expansion and refurbishing of Andr√°ssy Avenue and the construction of the first metro line in Budapest (). Construction was mostly completed in 1900, which was when the square received its name. The four allegoric sculptures were added in 1906, the monument as a whole basically looked like it does today (except for the kings' statues), complete with the surrounding museums on either side, and it was inaugurated still in the same year, 1906. When the monument was originally constructed, Hungary was a part of the Austro- Hungarian Empire and thus the last five spaces for statues on the left of the colonnade were reserved for members of the ruling Habsburg dynasty. From left to right these were Ferdinand I (relief: Defense of the Castle at Eger); Leopold I (relief: Eugene of Savoy defeats the Turks at Zenta), Charles III, Maria Theresa (relief: The Hungarian Diet votes support \\"vitam et sanguinem\\") and Franz Joseph (relief: Franz Joseph crowned by Gyula Andr√°ssy). The monument was damaged in World War II and when it was rebuilt the Habsburgs were replaced by the current figures. On 16 June 1989 a crowd of 250,000 gathered at the square for the historic reburial of Imre Nagy, who had been executed in June 1958. There are also three other squares in Budapest entitled H≈ës√∂k tere, in Soroks√°r, B√©k√°smegyer and R√°kosliget. A lesser known fact even for Hungarians that the Memorial Stone of Heroes (H≈ës√∂k eml√©kk√∂ve) is not a tomb and is erroneously referred as the \\"Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\\". Hungary has no Tomb of Unknown Soldier like most European countries, neither any memorial to the unknown fallen of wars. No human remnants interred here, there is only an artesian well under the tombstone-like memorial. The Memorial Stone of Heroes was originally erected in 1929 as a tribute to those who died for defending Hungary's 1000 years old borders. It was removed in 1951 as its message was politically unacceptable for the Communist regime. The current one has been built at the same spot in 1956. The memorial is surrounded by a fence and it's off limits for visitors. The Ministry of Defence only opens the gate for foreign dignitaries and official state ceremonies. Behind the cenotaph but within the decorative chain is a flat bronze plate which marks the site of an artesian well whose drilling was completed in 1878 by Vilmos Zsigmondy. This well provides water for the Sz√©chenyi Baths behind the monument and the Dag√°ly Baths in the N√©pf√ºrd≈ë utca. The well reached a depth of 971 meters and produces 831 liters of hot water per minute at 74 degrees Celsius The Heroes' Square monument has a 90% duplicate in Shanghai Global Paradise, Shanghai. Since its opening in 1996, it has been mostly degraded and most statues removed.  Millennium Monument  At the front of the monument is a large stone cenotaph surrounded by an ornamental iron chain. The cenotaph is dedicated \\"To the memory of the heroes who gave their lives for the freedom of our people and our national independence.\\" While some guide books refer to this as a \\"tomb\\" it is not a burial place. The back of the monument consists of two matched colonnades, each with seven statues representing great figures of Hungarian history. This is a list of the statesmen who are portrayed by the sculptures in the semi-circular arcades of the monument. The topic of the relief below each figure is given below the name. = Statues of the column = File:Budapest - Millennium monument.jpgThe column File:Gabor arkangyal.jpgThe top of the column depicts Archangel Gabriel, who holds the Hungarian Holy Crown and the apostolic double cross in his hands File:Hosok Tere Budapest - left side.jpgLeft side view of some of the statues of the Seven chieftains of the Magyars Directly behind the cenotaph is a column topped by a statue of the archangel Gabriel. In his right hand the angel holds the Holy Crown of St. Stephen (Istvan), the first king of Hungary. In his left hand the angel holds a two barred apostolic cross, a symbol awarded to St. Stephen by the Pope in recognition of his efforts to convert Hungary to Christianity. In Hungarian it is referred to as the double cross or the apostolic double cross. At the base of the column is a group of seven mounted figures representing the Magyar chieftains who led the Hungarian people into the Carpathian basin. In the front is √Årp√°d, considered the founder of the Hungarian nation. Behind him are the chieftains El≈ëd, Ond, Kond, Tas, Huba, and T√∂h√∂t√∂m (T√©t√©ny).

The title of Five by Five is a play on words‚Äîfive tracks recorded by the five members of the band. History Because Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were still honing their songwriting skills, only \\"Empty Heart\\" and \\"2120 South Michigan Avenue\\" were credited to \\"Nanker Phelge\\", a pseudonym for band-written compositions. The rest of the EP is composed of R&B; covers from some of their favorite artists.

At times it also included parts of County Fermanagh, County Sligo, County Leitrim, County Tyrone and County Londonderry at its greatest extent. The kingdom represented the core homeland of the Cen√©l Conaill people of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill and although they ruled, there were smaller groups of other Gaels in the area. From the 5th century founding of Cen√©l Conaill, the tuatha was a sub-unit of the larger kingdom of Ailech, along with their Cen√©l nE√≥gain cousins, fellow descendants of Niall of the Nine Hostages. Their initial ascent had coincided with the decline of the Ulaid, whose kingdom of Ulster receded to the north-east coast. In the 12th century the kingdom of Ailech split into two sovereign territories and Cen√©l Conaill became T√≠r Chonaill under the √ì Domhnaill (O'Donnell) clan. It was the location of fighting during the Nine Years' War (Ireland) at the end of the 16th Century. It continued to exist until the 17th century when it was incorporated into the English-ruled Kingdom of Ireland following the Flight of the Earls. Geographically It lay in the area now more commonly referred to as County Donegal, although the kingdom and later principality of Tyrconnell was larger than that, including parts of Sligo, Leitrim (in present-day Republic of Ireland), Tyrone, Fermanagh and a southern part of Londonderry (in present-day Northern Ireland). According to Geoffrey Keating, it included the baronies of Carbury (, in County Sligo), Rosclogher (, in County Leitrim), and Magheraboy (, mainly Toorah or Tuath Ratha) and Firlurg (, in County Fermanagh). As such it had a size varying between that of Corsica (8,680 km2) and Lebanon (10,452 km2). Associated aristocracy Although the elective Chieftaincy of O'Donnell is extinct since the abolition of Tanistry and Brehon Law, the Chief of the Name is known as The O'Donnell of Tyrconnell, as recognised by the Chief Herald of Ireland, as the legitimate successor in a putative sequence of Chiefs of the Name (by male primogeniture), and would default to the Duke of Tetuan in Spain in succession to the current Chief, a Franciscan priest, who has no eligible progeny. However, following advice by the Attorney General in 2003, the Genealogical Office discontinued the practice of recognising Chiefs of the Name.Termination of the system of Courtesy Recognition as Chief of the Name Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland (.PDF file) The Hereditary Seneschal of Tyrconnell (currently vested in a living O'Donnell, who was already ennobled as a Knight of Malta, and who inherited the Seneschalship from his father), survives under the auspices of the Hereditary Great Seneschal or Lord High Steward of Ireland, currently Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 22nd Earl of Shrewsbury, senior direct descendant of George Carpenter, 2nd Earl of Tyrconnell (of the 4th creation), and senior kin of Richard Talbot, Duke of Tyrconnel. Diocese of Raphoe St. Eunan's Cathedral was the seat of the Bishop of Raphoe, which formed the religious center of Tyrconnell. The religion which predominated at an official level in Tyrconnell was Catholic Christianity. The territory of Tyrconnell was associated with the Diocese of Raphoe under the Bishop of Raphoe, which had been formed in 1111. It was mentioned at the Synod of R√°th Breasail and covered T√≠r Conaill and Inis Eogain. Indeed, the Christian religion was of particular significance to the O'Donnell rulers of Tyrconnell, as their kinsman St. Colm Cille (also known as St. Columba), born at Conwal and Leck, was regarded as one of the three patron saints of Ireland. Their founder and namesake of the kingdom, Conall Gulban, had been the first nobleman converted by St. Patrick. Indeed, they later took up the symbol of the cross as part of one of their heraldic identifiers and adopted the motto in hoc signo vinces.

It was formed from the collapse of the large shield volcano the Piton des Neiges. The very remote and inaccessible cirque was settled in the 19th century by maroon slaves (i.e. slaves who had escaped from their masters), then later by poor white laborers. It owes its name to one maroon leader.Voyages.liberation.fr Geography The cirque is entirely enclosed by mountains, especially tall cliffs, known as remparts, save for the sole river exiting, the Rivi√®re des Galets (\\"river of the pebbles\\"). Inside the cirque, there are considerable declivities. The √Ælets are pieces of more-or-less flat lands, on which the hamlets are located. The name \\"Mafate\\" comes from the Malagasy word \\"Mahafaty\\", which means lethal, an allusion to the difficulty for accessing the Cirque. Population The cirque has one village, La Nouvelle, and several hamlets: Marla, Roche-Plate, the √élet-aux-Orangers, etc. The Cirque is entirely public property, managed by the Forestry service, from which the inhabitants rent inexpensive concessions. There is no main electrical supply. Inhabitants thus produce their own electricity using solar panels (with battery storage), and occasionally diesel generators. However, fuel for the latter must be brought by helicopter at high cost. Because of the reduced available power supply, inhabitants systematically use low-consumption (fluorescent) light bulbs. Similarly, all inhabitants use solar water heaters. These can be supplemented by gas-powered heaters -- but gas canisters must also be brought by helicopter. Services La Nouvelle and hamlets have grocery stores where staples can be bought. Typically, these stores also provide some limited bar and restaurant services (hot coffee and local fast food, such as samosas). Many inhabitants have opened g√Ætes (dormitories, WC and showers) where hikers can stay for the night, and often dine, for a fee. La Nouvelle and several of the hamlets have elementary schools. In 2005, the school at Marla reopened with 6 pupils after being closed for an insufficient number of schoolchildren. There are no secondary nor higher education facilities. There are several dispensaries between which a few nurses rotate, as well as scheduled visits of a physician, but no permanent health care facilities. All emergencies have to be evacuated by helicopter. There is no Gendarmerie station. Transportation One originality of Mafate is that there are no roads. Because of this, it is a major attraction for hikers willing to experience some unspoiled nature, while still benefiting from grocery stores and other amenities. For this reason, with the impending creation of a national park on the heights of R√©union, it seems very unlikely that roads would be ever built. All access, including for supplies, is by foot or helicopter. There are a number of footpaths for accessing the cirque, among which: * By the Col des B≈ìufs (\\"pass of the oxen\\"), from the Cirque de Salazie, leading to La Nouvelle. This way is the easiest, since there is a forestry road leading to parking lots at the pass. * By the Col du Ta√Øbit from the Cirque de Cilaos. * By the Canalisation des Orangers on the heights of Saint Paul (R√©union).

It is in the civil parish of Exbury and Lepe. It lies just in the New Forest, near the Beaulieu River and about a mile from the Solent coast. It is best known as the location of Exbury House, built by the Rothschild family , and the famous Exbury Gardens. The Rothschild family still have significant land ownings in the area. Overview The village was originally in the southwest corner of the parish, but moved inland in the early 19th century.Hampshire County Council website The present village was built to provide homes for workers on the Exbury Estate and still does provide homes for a few workers but is now mainly private housing. A prominent feature of the village is a water tower which provided the water to the gardens that was used to water the plants. The parish church was built in 1827, replacing an earlier chapel near Lower Exbury Farm. Until 1863 Exbury was a chapelry in the parish of Fawley. The village forms part of the civil parish of Exbury and Lepe, which in turn is part of the New Forest district of the county of Hampshire. The parish, district and county councils are responsible for different aspects of local administration. History People have lived near Exbury since prehistoric times. An Iron-Age promontory fort is visible on the east bank of the Beaulieu River, where it is defended on the east side by a bank and outer ditch.Monument No. 460661, Pastscape In the 13th century the Foliot family were holders of the Exbury in chief of the Crown.Victoria County History of Hampshire: Exbury At the end of the century the estate was divided into two, but by the end of the 14th century both parts were in the hands of John de Bettesthorne. On the death of John de Bettesthorne in 1399, his inheritance passed to his daughter Elizabeth and her husband Sir John de Berkeley. It remained in the hands of the Berkeley family for most of the 15th century. At the end of that century the manor had passed to Katherine Berkeley, who had married John Brewerton, and it then descended to the Comptons of Compton Wynyates, Warwickshire, who held it for the next two hundred years. In 1718 Exbury passed to William Mitford, and by the early 1800s it had descended to his grandson William Mitford the historian of Greece. William decided to build a new village at Upper Exbury.The Parish Church of St. Katherine Exbury The original village and its chapel at Lower Exbury to the south-west were removed,Hampshire Treasures Volume 5 (New Forest) Page 115 and a site was designated for a new church, which was built in 1827. William Mitford died in 1827, and his grandson Henry Reveley Mitford succeeded to the estate. He sold it, in the 1880s, to Major John Forster. His son Henry William Forster inherited Exbury, living in Lepe House. Exbury House In 1919 the eminent banker Lionel Nathan de Rothschild bought Exbury House, the house being nearly derelict at that time.Family Links The Rothschild Family The house was remodelled in 1927,Exbury House, Pastscape and Lionel created a new garden, collecting plants from all over the world. When he died in 1942, the house was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and used it for the planning and operation of the Dieppe raids and D-Day landings. Exbury estate was used for experimental firing, and barracks housing up to 300 men were constructed within the grounds. Lionel's son Edmund Leopold de Rothschild took on the responsibility for the estate after the war, restoring the house and gardens. Exbury Gardens opened to the public in 1955. When Edmund died in 2009, his brother Leopold David de Rothschild took over, creating a Charitable Trust to secure the financial future of the gardens. Church The earliest mention of a chapel at Exbury is in 1291, when \\"Master Nicholas de Audeby\\" held the church of Fawley with the chapel of Exbury. The chapel of St. Katherine was at Lower Exbury. This chapel was served by the Cistercians from Beaulieu Abbey, the tradition being that the monks used to cross the river from Saint Leonard's on stepping-stones. The chapel was pulled down in 1827, when the present church at Exbury was built. Exbury church is a stone structure with a northwest tower.Hampshire Treasures Volume 5 (New Forest) Page 118 It was consecrated in 1827.

History Exbury House Lionel Nathan de Rothschild purchased the Exbury estate in 1919 and soon set to creating a garden on an ambitious scale. The infrastructure included a water tower, three large concrete lined ponds, and of underground piping. Exbury is now open to the public for most of the year, with high seasons in the spring for the flowering shrubs and the autumn for the autumn colour. Exbury House itself is a neoclassical mansion which was built around an earlier structure in the 1920s. It is not open to the public. The gardens Exbury is a informal woodland garden with very large collections of rhododendrons, azaleas and camellias, and is often considered the finest garden of its type in the United Kingdom. Exbury holds the national collection of Nyssa (Tupelo) and Oxydendrum under the NCCPG National Plant Collection scheme run by the National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens.NCCPG: Exbury - OxydendrumNCCPG: Exbury - Nyssa Other features include the Hydrangea Walk, the Rock Garden, Iris Garden, the Sundial Garden, Centenary Garden and Camellia Walk (which takes visitors to a path alongside Beaulieu river and back via the pond).

Steam railway  \\"Naomi\\" with three coaches at Exbury Central In the north east corner of the gardens there is also the gauge Exbury Steam Railway that goes on a journey through a tunnel, around Dragonfly Pond, through the Summer Lane Garden, along the top of the rock gardens and into the American Garden. The railway was built in 2000‚Äì2001 as an additional attraction in the gardens. Two narrow gauge style 0-6-2 tender tank locos were built specially for the line by the Exmoor Steam Railway. The railway is a member of Britain's Great Little Railways. The railway however has proved to be more popular than anyone had anticipated, with trains often needing to be double headed. To solve this problem, a much larger 2-6-2 tender loco, called Marriloo, was built at Exmoor, and entered service on the line in 2008. It is notable for having carried the Queen on a footplate trip round the railway.

According to author Robert Elman, Juan Cortina and his followers were the first \\"socially motivated border bandits,\\" similar to the Garzistas and the Villistas of later generations. The fighting took place in the Rio Grande Valley area, which straddles the international border of Texas and Mexico.Elman, pg. 189-190 Trouble =First Cortina War= The First Cortina War began at Brownsville on July 13, 1859, when Cortina shot the town marshal, Robert Shears, in the arm for his brutalizing of Cortina's former employee, Tom√°s Cabrera. Tension increased between Cortina and the Brownsville authorities, and on September 28 he raided and occupied the town with a posse of between forty and eighty men. His enemies, however, had fled. During the occupation of Brownsville, Cortina issued a proclamation to reveal his intentions to both communities, quoting from : > \\"(...) There is no need of fear. Orderly people and honest citizens are > inviolable to us in their persons and interests. Our object, as you have > seen, has been to chastise the villainy of our enemies, which heretofore has > gone unpunished. These have connived with each other, and form, so to speak, > a perfidious inquisitorial lodge to persecute and rob us, without any cause, > and for no other crime on our part than that of being of Mexican origin, > considering us, doubtless, destitute of those gifts which they themselves do > not possess. (...) Mexicans! Peace be with you! Good inhabitants of the > State of Texas, look on them as brothers, and keep in mind that which the > Holy Spirit saith: \\"Thou shalt not be the friend of the passionate man; nor > join thyself to the madman, lest thou learn his mode of work and scandalize > thy soul.\\" Cortina retained control over Brownsville until September 30, 1859, when he evacuated the town at the urging of influential residents of Matamoros. The following days, the townsfolk of Brownsville formed a twenty-man group in order to fight Cortina, called the \\"Brownsville Tigers\\". In November, the Brownsville Tigers learned that Cortina was at his mother's home, called Rancho del Carmen, five miles west of Brownsville. They immediately launched an attack, only to be sent into retreat in disarray by the \\"Cortinistas\\", as they were called. Later the same month, the Brownsville Tigers were joined by a group of Texas Rangers, and Cortina decided to attack them. The offensive was unsuccessful. In December, a second group of rangers led by Captain John \\"Rip\\" Ford arrived, larger and better organized. Because of appeals from Brownsville residents, the United States Army sent troops from San Antonio to the nearby Fort Brown, which had been abandoned a few years ago. The fort's new commander, Major Samuel Heintzelman, united and coordinated all armed groups to put an end to the Cortina threat. Cortina retreated up the Rio Grande, until on December 27, 1859, Heintzelman and Ford engaged him in the Battle of Rio Grande City. Cortina's forces were decisively defeated, losing sixty men and all their equipment. Pursued and defeated again by Ford few days later, Cortina retreated with his men into the Burgos Mountains. The First Cortina War was mostly finished, and with increasing pressure from both the United States and Mexican Governments to cease all hostile activities, Cortina remained away from the scene for more than a year. The final engagements of the war were the Battle of La Bolsa, on February 4, 1860, and the Battle of La Mesa, on March 17. The Texas Rangers, under Ford, successfully defended their riverboat in the first engagement and routed the Cortinistas across the river at La Mesa, Tamaulipas. Texas Historical Marker in Rio Grande City Texas historical marker on Highway 281 along the Rio Grande at the Hidalgo-Cameron county line. =Second Cortina War= In May 1861, the much shorter Second Cortina War occurred. The American Civil War had just begun, and Cortina, who had aligned himself with the Federal Government of the United States, invaded Zapata County, Texas. Defeated by Confederate Captain Santos Benavides at the Battle of Carrizo and losing 18 men, Cortina retreated into Mexico. Cortina no longer conducted any large-scale military incursions within the United States, although he was accused several times of promoting guerrilla actions against the richer Texan landowners in the area throughout the following years. Chronology * The First Cortina War begins on July 13, 1859, when Brownsville town marshal Robert Shears was shot in the arm by Juan Nepomuceno Cortina for brutalizing his former ranch hand, Tom√°s Cabrera (who was said to be drunk and causing a scene in Gabriel Catchell's coffee shop), and after ignoring Cortina's request to let him handle the situation. Cortina would become one of the most important historical figures of the area, and continued to exert a decisive influence in the local events until his arrest in 1875. * On September 28, 1859, Juan Cortina raided and seized control of Brownsville with a forty to eighty man posse with the intent of killing his enemies in Brownsville. His enemies went into hiding and Cortina and his men shot five of the town's people presumably involved in the legal abuses against Texans of Mexican ethnicity. No indiscriminate attacks on the rest of the Brownsville population or on their properties took place under orders of Cortina. Cortina issues a famous proclamation, attempting to calm the American population of Brownsville, and asking for respect towards the Mexican inhabitants' persons and properties. * On September 30, 1859, Cortina evacuates Brownsville at the urging of Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carbajal, Colonel Miguel Tijerina, Colonel Macedonio Capistran, Don Agapito Longoria, and Don Manuel Trevi√±o, from Matamoros. The following days, Brownsville forms a twenty-man group in order to fight Cortina, calling themselves the \\"Brownsville Tigers\\". The Mexican authorities, fearing reprisals from the United States Government, instruct the Matamoros militia to join them. The group, led by Adolphus Glaevecke, capture Tom√°s Cabrera. * In November 1859, the Brownsville Tigers learn that Cortina is at his mother's ranch near Santa Rita, Texas, now a ghost town, five miles west of Brownsville, the Tigers attack only to be sent into retreat in disarray by Cortina's forces. * Later in the same month, the Brownsville Tigers were joined by a group of Texas Rangers. Cortina demanded the release of Cabrera by threatening to burn Brownsville. The Tigers hang Cabrera in the early part of that month and the very next day the Cortinistas launched an unsuccessful attack. * On November 23, 1859, Cortina issued a second proclamation asking Texas Governor Sam Houston to defend the legal interests of Mexican residents in Texas. * In December 1859, the second group of Texas Rangers led by Captain John \\"Rip\\" Ford and a regiment of the United States Army commanded by Major Samuel Heintzelman joined the Brownsville Tigers. Cortina retreats up the Rio Grande. * On December 27, 1859, Heintzelman and Ford engaged Cortina in the Battle of Rio Grande City. Cortina was decisively defeated, losing sixty men and his equipment. * On February 4, 1860, Captain John \\"Rip\\" Ford and a group of rangers successfully defended their riverboat against Cortina's men in the Battle of La Bolsa. * On March 17, 1860, Captain John \\"Rip\\" Ford defeated the Cortinistas at La Mesa, Tamaulipas. The First Cortina War finishes. * The Second Cortina War took place in May 1861. Cortina invaded Zapata County and attacked the county seat, Zapata. He was defeated by Confederate Captain Santos Benavides in the Battle of Carrizo and retreated back into Mexico, after losing eighteen men. By the end of the wars, at least 245 men had been killed, most of whom were Cortinistas. * In the 1870s, future Mexican President Porfirio D√≠az received a large monetary contribution from the citizens of Brownsville in order to remove Juan Cortina, under the pretext that he was rustling cattle across the border. In July 1875, Cortina is arrested and taken to Mexico City, where he would remain until his death in 1894.

He is best known for his discovery and excavation of Flag Fen, a Bronze Age archaeological site near Peterborough, as well as for his frequent appearances on the Channel 4 television series Time Team.PRYOR, Dr Francis Manning Marlborough‚Äô, Who's Who 2012, A & C Black, 2012; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2011 ; online edn, Nov 2011 accessed 13 Jan 2012 Born to a Burke's Landed Gentry family, Pryor studied at Eton College before going on to study archaeology at Trinity College, Cambridge. With his first wife, he moved to Canada, where he worked as a technician at the Royal Ontario Museum for a year before returning to Britain. He has now retired from full-time field archaeology, but still appears on television and writes books as well as being a working sheep farmer.  Biography  Pryor is the son of Barbara Helen Robertson and Robert Matthew Marlborough Pryor MBE TD (known as Matthew), as well as being the grandson of Walter Marlborough Pryor DSO DL JP; both his grandfather and father had been British Army officers, serving in the First and Second World Wars respectively.Burke's Peerage and Gentry: Pryor of Weston http://www.burkespeerage.com/FamilyHomepage.aspx?FID=11324 He was educated at Temple Grove School in East Sussex, then at Eton College alongside his first cousin William Pryor, before studying archaeology at Trinity College, Cambridge, gaining a PhD in 1985. He married Sylvia in 1969, and migrated with her to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on a landed immigrant scheme. There he started working at the Royal Ontario Museum as technician, working for Doug Tushingham who helped fund Pryor's first project in the United Kingdom. This was at North Elmham and the excavation was directed by Peter Wade-Martins who exposed Pryor to the benefit of opening large area excavations. Pryor returned to the UK in 1970, where the construction of the new town at Peterborough offered the opportunity to do large scale archaeology ahead of the planned development work. Between 1970 and 1978, he alternated between digs in the UK and writing up the excavation reports and giving presentations on his work in Canada. Pryor and his first wife were divorced in 1977, and during the course of these projects, he met his second wife, Maisie Taylor, an expert in prehistoric wood; they worked together on the series of projects in the Peterborough area, the most famous of which is Flag Fen. He has a daughter, Amy, from his first marriage. He was a founding member of the Institute of Field Archaeologists in 1982. In 1991 he published his first book about Flag Fen, entitled Flag Fen: Prehistoric Fenland Centre, for a series co-produced by English Heritage and B.T. Batsford. The final monograph on the site - entitled The Flag Fen Basin: Archaeology and environment of a Fenland Landscape - was published in 2001 as an English Heritage Archaeological Report. Pryor followed this with a third book on the site, published by Tempus in 2005; entitled Flag Fen: Life and Death of a Prehistoric Landscape, it represented what he considered to be a \\"major revision\\" of his 1991 work, for instance rejecting the earlier \\"lake village\\" concept. Pryor was awarded an MBE \\"for services to tourism\\" in the 1999 Queen's Birthday Honours. After his retirement from archaeology, Pryor would devote his time to sheep farming, being the owner of 40 acres of fenland pasture in Lincolnshire. In an interview with the Financial Times, he asserted that through this vocation, he felt a connection with the people of Bronze Age Britain, who also lived off this form of subsistence, before also expressing his opinion that human overpopulation represented a significant threat to the human species, urging people to have fewer children and eat less meat. One of Pryor's four times great grandfathers is Samuel Hoare, the Quaker and founding member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade.

He also teaches Hung Gar Kung Fu at Chiu Chi Ling Hung Gar Kung Fu Association, a San Francisco-based martial arts school he founded, and at the old Chiu Family Kwoon in Hong Kong. Every year he visits his students and grand students around the world and organizes worldwide Kung Fu tournaments. The Kung Fu lineage he is part of was passed down directly from southern shaolin temple and carries names like Hung Hei Gung and Wong Fei Hung. He has appeared in over 70 movies, both as an actor and stunt man. His abilities as an actor and martial arts practitioner has allowed him to work with most of the top Hong Kong film makers including Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Chow Yun-fat and Stephen Chow. He started practising Hung Gar Kung Fu when he was six years old under the tutelage of his father Chiu Kau (who won with the famous tiger-crane set over the whole of China in his sixties) and mother Shiu Ying, who were renowned for their solid Hung Gar. They were also both well-known doctors and Chiu Chi Ling learned from his father, beside the art of Kung Fu, the art of bone setting (Dit-Da). In the early 1970s, he opened a school which attracted many celebrities, athletes and performers. This exposure to the entertainment industry gave him his start in acting. He has appeared in such well-known Kung Fu style movies as Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, Duel of the Seven Tigers, the comic smash-hit Kung Fu Hustle, Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons. Adventures of Power and The Mermaid. Chiu Chu Ling has also appeared in ‚ÄúTiger and Crane Shaolin Kung Fu‚Äù demonstrating the techniques from shaolin tiger and crane.

He is an emeritus professor of the University of Liverpool, where he was first appointed professor in 1965. From 1978 to 1980 he was the president of the London Mathematical Society.  Work  His early work was in cobordism theory in algebraic topology; this includes his 1959 Cambridge PhD thesis entitled \\"Algebraic aspects of cobordism\\", written under the direction of Frank Adams and Christopher Zeeman. His research was then mainly in the area of manifolds, particularly geometric topology and related abstract algebra included in surgery theory, of which he was one of the founders. In 1964 he introduced the Brauer‚ÄìWall group of a field. His 1970 research monograph \\"Surgery on Compact Manifolds\\" is a major reference work in geometric topology. In 1971 he conjectured that every finitely generated group is accessible. This conjecture is known as \\"Wall's conjecture\\". It motivated much progress in the understanding of splittings of groups. In 1985 Martin Dunwoody proved the conjecture for the class of finitely presented groups. The resolution of the full conjecture took until 1991 when, surprising to most mathematicians at the time, Dunwoody found a finitely generated group that is not accessible and hence the conjecture turned out to be not correct in its general formulation. Wall's work since the mid-1970s has mostly been in singularity theory as developed by R. Thom, J. Milnor and V. Arnold, and especially concerns the classification of isolated singularities of differentiable maps and of algebraic varieties. He has written two research monographs on singularity theory, \\"The Geometry of Topological Stability\\" (1995) (containing a great deal of original work) with Andrew du Plessis, and \\"Singular Points of Plane Curves\\" (2004). His notable students include Michael Boardman, Bill Bruce, Andrew Casson, Francis E. A. Johnson, David Mond, Andrew du Plessis, and David Trotman.

Dick. The film was directed by John Woo and stars Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman, Aaron Eckhart, Paul Giamatti, Michael C. Hall, Joe Morton, and Colm Feore. Plot In the near future, Michael Jennings is a reverse engineer; he analyzes his clients' competitors' technology and recreates it with improvements. To protect his clients' intellectual property and himself, Jennings undergoes memory wipe to remove knowledge of his engineering with aid of his friend Shorty. Jennings is contacted by his college roommate James Rethrick, the CEO of technology company Allcom. Rethrick offers Jennings a lengthy three-year job, during which he will be required to stay on Allcom's campus, in exchange for company stock. Jennings is hesitant but agrees. After being injected with the memory marker, Jennings is given a tour of the campus, where he meets and flirts with biologist Dr. Rachel Porter. Rethrick then introduces Jennings to his work partner, physicist William Dekker. Three years later, Jennings wakes from the memory wipe and is congratulated by Rethrick. Jennings finds that the Allcom stock he earned is valued at over , but when he goes to see his lawyer to get the funds, he discovers that he had given all the stock away just weeks ago. Further, he is given an envelope claiming to be his possessions on entering Allcom, but it contains a random assortment of items. Confused, Jennings soon finds himself detained by the FBI. Agent Dodge accuses Jennings of having access to classified government designs that had been taken by Dekker, who is now dead. Jennings cannot answer due to the memory wipe, but finds a means to escape using the items in the envelope. As he evades the FBI, Rethrick's right-hand-man John Wolfe sees Jennings walking away and warns Rethrick they have a problem. Jennings meets with Shorty to try to figure out what happened, but then sees a lottery number result on a television, the numbers matching those on a fortune cookie message in the envelope. He realizes that he must have built a machine at Allcom to see into the future, planting items in that envelope to help fix things. At Allcom, Rethrick tries to use Jennings' machine, but instead finds that it was jury-rigged to go offline after Jennings had left. Rethrick studies Jennings' habits while at Allcom and discovers that he got romantically involved with Porter and left a secret message to meet her at a cafe later that day. Rethrick sends a body double to try to coerce Jennings to turn over the envelope, but the real Porter shows up and rescues Jennings. The two elude the FBI and Rethrick's men. While hiding, they find that the stamps on the envelopes contain microdot images taken from the device, showing newspaper headlines from the future that while Allcom became incredibly successful with the device, it led to international political strife and the United States launching a pre-emptive nuclear strike. They agree that the machine must be destroyed. Using the last items in the envelope, Jennings and Porter gain access to Allcom and the machine, while separately the FBI have started to investigate Allcom. Jennings discovers the circuit he rigged and fixes it, while booby-trapping the machine to be destroyed in a few minutes. He uses the machine one last time to see himself being shot at by an FBI agent in the catwalks about the machine. Rethrick, Wolfe, and other men arrive, and Jennings and Porter escape to the catwalks. Wolfe tries to use the machine to help track Jennings, while Rethrick corners the pair on the catwalk. FBI storm the lab, and one appears on the catwalk, the same tableau that Jennings had seen. As the FBI fires, a watch from the envelope beeps, and Jennings dodges in time for the bullet to fatally hit Rethrick. Wolfe is killed as Jennings' booby-trap goes off and destroys the machine. After the chaos dies down and the FBI begin a full investigation, Agent Dodge finds the watch Jennings had used. Elsewhere, Jennings, Porter, and Shorty have moved to the countryside. Shorty was able to use his influence to rescue the cage of a pair of lovebirds Porter had been raising at Allcom. Recalling the fortune cookie message from the envelope, Jennings looks in the cage and finds a lottery ticket for the winning jackpot of .

Trademarks The film features several of director Woo's trademarks, including two Mexican standoffs, the appearance of a dove, and a hollow birdcage similar to the opening tea house scene of Hard Boiled. Reception =Critical response= Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 27% based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The site's consensus states, \\"Though Dick's short story has an intriguing premise, Woo reduces it to a lot of meaningless chases, shoot-outs, and explosions.\\" On Metacritic it has a score of 43 out of 100 based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B- on scale of A to F. Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film a positive review, calling it a \\"smart thriller\\" and praising \\"Woo's wonderful sense of timing and rhythm.\\" Chris Barsanti of Film Threat also praised Paycheck, calling it \\"one of the more competent and reassuring action movies to come out for quite some time.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film two stars (out of four), saying that he \\"enjoyed the movie\\" but felt that it \\"exploits [Philip K. Dick's story] for its action and plot potential, but never really develops it.\\" K. J. Doughton of Film Threat called the film \\"John Woo lite,\\" and a \\"neutered variation on his earlier, superior works.\\"Review by K. J. Doughton, Film Threat James Berardinelli gave the film one and a half stars out of four, calling it \\"a bad film, complete with lackluster acting, brainless writing, and uninspired direction.\\"Review by James Berardinelli, ReelViews About the movie's reception, John Woo said: \\"I was fine with the sci-fi in Paycheck because there wasn't too much. I had intended to make an Alfred Hitchcock-style movie out of it, something more about suspense and thrills than guns and shooting, but unfortunately the script wasn't written that way. It didn't work well for the suspense, and it didn't come out the way I wanted it to be, not as Hitchcockian. But at least it was nice working with Ben Affleck.\\" =Awards= Ben Affleck won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his performance in Paycheck and two others - Gigli and Daredevil. After asking why he did not get his trophy, he was presented the Razzie live on Larry King Live a week later, and promptly broke it. The broken Razzie was sold on eBay for enough money to cover the hall rental for the following year's ceremonies. While hosting Saturday Night Live, Ben Affleck joked that he would have walked out of the premiere and asked for his money back until he realized he was in the movie.

Biography Alexandre was born in Rouen, France. In 1654, he joined the Dominicans in his hometown. Shortly after his ordination, he was appointed professor (first regent) of philosophy at the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris, where he was later buried. The success of Alexandre's subsequent lectures at the Sorbonne led to his selection by Jean-Baptiste Colbert as tutor to his son, Jacques Nicolas Colbert, afterwards archbishop of Rouen. Alexandre obtained the degree of doctor in divinity from the Sorbonne in 1675 and for twelve years taught philosophy, theology and ecclesiastical law to the members of the Saint-Jacques community. He played a prominent part in ecclesiastical affairs and preached several times before Louis XIV, who granted him an annual pension of 800 livres. He became provincial of his order in 1706, but was banished to Ch√¢tellerault in 1709 for having subscribed to the Jansenist Cas de conscience (1703), and was deprived of his pension in 1713 on account of his opposition to the bull Unigenitus. He died in Paris on 21 August 1724, aged 85, having lost his sight some time before owing to his strenuous literary activity. He was buried in the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris. His numerous works are still much valued by ecclesiastical students.

Lubin films were distributed with a Liberty Bell trademark. History The Lubin Manufacturing Company was formed in 1902 and incorporated in 1909 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by Siegmund Lubin. The company was the offspring of Lubin's film equipment and film distribution and production business, which began in 1896. Siegmund Lubin, a Jewish immigrant from Poland, was originally an optical and photography expert in Philadelphia but became intrigued with Thomas Edison's motion picture camera and saw the potential in selling similar equipment as well as in making films. Known as \\"Pop\\" Lubin, he constructed his own combined camera/projector he called a \\"Cineograph\\" and his lower price and marketing know-how brought reasonable success. In 1897 Lubin began making films for commercial release, notably Meet Me at the Fountain in 1904. Certain his business could prosper, the following year he rented low-cost space on the roof of a building in Philadelphia's business district. He exhibited his new equipment at the 1899 National Export Exposition in Philadelphia and the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. ‚ÄúA Corner of the Assembling and Joining Room at the Philadelphia Studio of the Lubin Company‚Äù, The Photoplay Author, 1914 The insatiable appetite of the American public for motion picture entertainment saw Lubin's film company undergo enormous growth. Aided by French-born writer and poet Hugh Antoine d'Arcy, who served as the studio's publicity manager, in 1910 Siegmund Lubin built a state of the art studio on the corner of Indiana Avenue and Twentieth Street in Philadelphia that became known as \\"Lubinville.\\" At the time, it was one of the most modern studios in the world, complete with a huge artificially lit stage, editing rooms, laboratories, and workshops. The facility allowed several film productions to be undertaken simultaneously. The Lubin Manufacturing Company expanded production beyond Philadelphia, with facilities at 750 Riverside Avenue in Jacksonville, Florida, Los Angeles, and then in Coronado, California. In 1912, Lubin purchased a estate in Betzwood, in what was then rural countryside in the northwest outskirts of Philadelphia and converted the property into a studio and film lot. That same year, director and actor Romaine Fielding traveled out to Prescott, Arizona with cast and crew and set up offices at 712 Western Avenue and an outdoor stage for shooting interiors behind Mercy Hospital (now the site of Prescott College). He filmed approximately a dozen movies there before moving to Tucson, Arizona, where he directed another 60 or so silent short films. William Duncan and Selig Polyscope Company took over the Prescott facility. Some of the pioneer actors who worked for Lubin included Romaine Fielding, Ed Genung, Harry Myers, Florence Hackett, Alan Hale, Arthur V. Johnson, Lottie Briscoe, Florence Lawrence, Ethel Clayton, Gladys Brockwell, Edwin Carewe, Ormi Hawley, Rosemary Theby, Betty Brice, Alice Mann and Pearl White. Lubin films also marked the first film appearance of Oliver Hardy, who started working at Lubin's Jacksonville, Florida studio in 1913. Hardy's first onscreen appearance was in the 1914 movie, Outwitting Dad where he was billed as O. N. Hardy. In many of his later films at Lubin, he was billed as ‚ÄúBabe Hardy.‚Äù He was most often cast as ‚Äúthe heavy‚Äù or the villain and had roles in comedy shorts, appearing in some 50 short one-reeler films at Lubin by 1915. Decline However, the company's downfall came even faster than its meteoric rise. Lubin was not as adroit as its competitors in shifting to quality feature-length films. Also, a disastrous fire at its main studio in June 1914, damaged nearby buildings and destroyed the negatives for a number of unreleased new films, which severely hurt the business. When World War I broke out in Europe in September of that year, Lubin Studios, and other American filmmakers', lost a large source of income from these foreign sales. In 1915, the Lubin company entered into an agreement to form a film distribution partnership, with Vitagraph Studios, Selig Polyscope Company, and Essanay Studios, known as V-L-S-E, Incorporated. However, the decline of the Lubin operations continued and the United States Supreme Court rulings against the monopoly of the Motion Picture Patents Company spelled the end of Lubin's business. After making more than a thousand motion pictures the corporation was forced into bankruptcy and on September 1, 1916, the Lubin Manufacturing Company closed its doors for good. Patent battle with Edison For years the Lubin Manufacturing Company, like most of the other major film studios, had a running legal battle with Thomas Edison that saw repeated lawsuits brought against Lubin for patent infringement. Eventually, Lubin gave up the costly fight with Edison and became part of the Motion Picture Patents Company, a monopoly on production and distribution set up by Edison.

Visual extinction is a neurological disorder which occurs following damage to the parietal lobe of the brain. It is similar to, but distinct from, hemispatial neglect. Visual extinction has the characteristic symptom of difficulty to perceive contralesional stimuli when presented simultaneously with an ipsilesional stimulus, but the ability to correctly identify them when not presented simultaneously. Under simultaneous presentation, the contralesional stimulus is apparently ignored by the patient, or extinguished. This deficiency may lead to difficulty on behalf of the patient with processing the stimuli‚Äôs 3D position.Vuilleumier, PO, Rafal, RD (2000). \\"A systematic study of visual extinction: between- and within-field deficits of attention in hemispatial neglect\\". Brain 123,1263-1279.\\"Neuroexam.com - Vision (CN II).\\" neuroexam.com - An interactive online guide to the neurologic examination. 30 Sep. 2009 History Visual Extinction is the result of unilateral cerebral damagePavlovskaya, Marina, Sagi, Dov, Soroker, Nachum, Ring Haim (1997). \\"Visual extinction and cortical connectivity in human vision\\". Cognitive Brain Research 6(2), 159-162. and has always been poorly understood. Researchers have been studying visual extinction in great depth since the 1990s. It has since been commonly associated with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain. Studies have suggested that visual extinction may be a result of sensory imbalance. This imbalance is due to weak or delayed afferent inputs in the hemisphere affected by the extinction. Research done by Pavlovskaya, Sagi, Soroker and Ring show that visual extinction is dependent on simple stimuli properties. These properties are thought to reflect connectivity constraints during the early steps of visual processing. Physiological basis Visual extinction arises from damage to the parietal lobe of the brain. This damage most frequently arises following a stroke or other infarction in that area ‚Äì however, any traumatic event sufficient to cause widespread tissue damage in the area may cause sufficient harm. Although both sides of the brain are vulnerable to such damage, it is more unusual for extinction to occur when the left hemisphere is damaged than the right.Becker, E, Karnath, HO (2007). \\"Incidence of visual extinction after left versus right hemisphere stroke.\\" Stroke 38(12), 3172-3174. When presented with simultaneous stimuli, the patient will ignore the contralesional stimuli, and only report the ipsilesional. Their ability to report the stimuli correctly when presented singly indicates that this is not a problem with vision per se. This bias against contralesional stimuli is evident even when patients are presented with two signals within the ipsilesional visual field, whose processing remains intact following the damage, since it is done in the opposite brain hemisphere. This implies that extinction can be somewhat controlled by biasing the point of visual fixation contralesionally, such that all relevant stimuli are contained within the functioning side of the visual field, findings supported in experimentShalev, L, Chajut, E, Humphreys, GW (2005). \\"Interactive perceptual and attentional limits in visual extinction\\". Neurocase 11(6), 452-462. Fatigue and habituation effects have previously been connected to visual extinction; experiments such as those done by Vuilleumier and Rafal eliminate the connection of these effects with visual extinction. Historically, it was believed that the parietal damage weakened afferent neuron input to the visual cortex, and so the extinction event was caused by the signals originating in the contralesional field being lost during transmission. However, this does not account for the ability of extinction patients being able to correctly identify contralesional stimuli in isolation. A more current theory is called the \\"race theory.\\" Race theory holds that stimuli are competing for processing power within the brain. Following parietal damage, all contralesional messages are lowered in priority for the brain‚Äôs processing in some way ‚Äì potentially by signal transmission delay ‚Äì such that when presented with alternative stimuli, the contralesional stimulus doesn‚Äôt arrive at the decision center simultaneously with the ipsilesional stimulus, and thus is denied conscious processing. The race theory sees some support in findings by Marzi et al.,Marzi, CA, Girelli, M, Natale, E, Miniussi, C (2001). \\"What exactly is extinguished in unilateral visual extinction? Neurophysiological evidence.\\" Neuropsychologia 39(12), 1354-1366. where patients who show extinction also display aggravated delays in their reaction time to stimuli, both when compared to patients who have other forms of right-brain damage and undamaged patients. In the study, patients were shown to be able to focus their attention and improve reaction time, but still have subnormal performance. This theory is given further support by Gorea and Sagi‚Äôs inducing of extinction-like events in undamaged patients when presented with simultaneous stimuli of different intensities, with the lower intensity stimulus being extinguished by the mere presence of the high intensity stimulus.Gorea, A, Sagi, D (2002). \\"Natural Extinction: A criterion shift phenomenon.\\" Visual Cognition 9, 913-936 Extinction frequency may also be affected by reporting method, due to how visual processing interacts with the rest of the brain.Smania, N, Martini, MC, Prior, M, Marzi, CA (1996). \\"Input and response determinants of visual extinction: A case study.\\" Cortex 121, 1759-70. Reported extinctions drop when the patient is told to relay the extinction news by a method other than speaking ‚Äì particularly, the use of the eyes in a feedback loop (looking to the side if there is a single stimuli, and up if there are two). This may work by eliminating the need for hemispheric transfer of information ‚Äì routing the response to the motor cortex instead of the visual cortex ‚Äì and so shortening the path and response time, a conclusion supported by increased detection of isolated contralesional stimuli under such circumstances. Although extinction is compared with hemispatial neglect, the two are different disorders. It is possible to exhibit one without the other, and the neural basis for each appears to be different, hemispatial neglect arising from tempo-parietal junction damage. Although patients may exhibit these disorders simultaneously, this occurs in less than half of the afflicted population. Characteristics * When measuring the ERP of the right parietal lobe during extinction events, EEGs do not display the P1 or N1 waves otherwise evidenced in healthy bilateral response. * When presented with stimuli, eye saccades from fixation point are more common in extinction patients, are longer in duration, and show ipsilesional bias in movement. * Some evidence for a slight increase in detection of eccentric stimuli in the ipsilesional visual field ‚Äì i.e. slightly improved peripheral vision. * Patients show increased difference in reaction time (crossed-uncrossed difference) for processing in contralesional and ipsilesional visual hemispheres. Diagnosis Diagnosis is achieved through several related methods. One approach involves having patients sit in front of a computer screen, on which either stars or triangles are projected simultaneously in different areas of the screen. Patients are then asked to identify the locations and identities of the shapes. Another similar approach is to project colored letters on the screen, again asking patients to identify the letter and color in different parts of the screen.Rorden C, Jelsone L, Simon-Dack S, Baylis LL, Baylis GC (2009). \\"Visual extinction: The effect of temporal and spatial bias\\". Neuropsychologia 47,321-329. From this information, a diagnosis of visual extinction can be attained. A positive diagnosis results from a patient's inability to correctly identify shapes or letters projected simultaneously in different areas of the screen. However, the most common test for visual extinction is the finger confrontation model. In this test, the doctor asks the patient to note which of his hands have moving fingers. This can be used immediately following a stroke, for the doctor‚Äôs quick diagnosis. Treatment Without any sort of treatment, visual extinction usually worsens in severity of symptoms or remains completely stagnant. Simple exercises, such as reading and copying tasks, can be useful in treating the symptoms and increasing brain activity, though the damaged area can never be completely healed since the dead brain cells do not regenerate. An individual should keep up with exercises designed to maintain or improve function in order to create the best chance of improvement and/or maintenance at his or her current state.Bailey, M, Riddoch, MJ, Crome, P (2002). \\"Treatment of visual neglect in elderly patients with stroke: A single-subject series using either a scanning and cueing strategy or a left-limb activation strategy\\". Physical Therapy 82.8, 782-797. Treatment methods for patients who suffer from visual extinction generally involve use and training of an individual's vision. A doctor may instruct a patient to scan rows of lights in different ways in an attempt to regenerate function. Some light boards do exist that are used specifically to aid this task. Other methods exist that are designed to force the patient to focus on multiple stimuli at the same time. These cueing and scanning methods do yield results, but they are not consistent across all patients. In successful cases, generally forty hours of retraining the patients' vision were necessary as well as some additional work done at home with similar exercises. Other computer scanning methods of treatment were shown to be effective with specialized equipment designed specifically for scanning and cueing exercises to force patients to focus on multiple stimuli simultaneously. Again, the results of these methods were not consistent, but in laboratory settings rehabilitation was successful. Of the individuals who recovered some function, not all maintained the function they recovered, losing it after about five months. In another, single-stimulus rehabilitatory approach, the patient is shown a computer screen with a box in each corner and a fixation cross at the center. When a stimulus appears in any of the boxes, the patient is instructed to indicate seeing it as quickly as possible. This task is eased somewhat by an indicating icon before the stimulus ‚Äì either an arrow that points to the box the stimulus is most likely (but not guaranteed) to be in, or a cross to indicate that the stimulus could appear in any box. Following thirty hour-long sessions, patients demonstrated a significant decrease in both extinction and hemispatial neglect.Ladavas, E, Menghini, G, Umilta, C. \\"On the Rehalibation of Hemispatial Neglect.\\" In Riddoch & Humphreys (Ed.) Cognitive Neuropsychology and Cognitive Rehabilitation 151-172. East Sussex, UK: Lawrence Erlbaum Associateds Publishing. In patients whose brain damage was in the right hemisphere, left limb activation (LLA) was another treatment that proved effective.GA Eskes, B Butler, A McDonald, ER Harrison, SJ Phillips (2003). \\"Limb activation effects in hemispatial neglect\\" Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation 84(3), 323-328. The theory behind this method of treatment is that any use of the damaged side of the brain will enhance all functions related to the damaged hemisphere and that use of the opposite (healthy) side will only cause further impairment. LLA therefore is merely the concentrated use of the left side of the body in patients whose damage is in the right hemisphere (since the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body). This forces the patient to exercise spatial awareness using the damaged side of the brain, increasing activity around the lesion. While generally a treatment used for visual neglect (a different but related neurological disorder), LLA still increases brain activity around damaged area in patients with visual extinction and generates improvement in some patients. The reason this treatment does not work in some cases of visual extinction is that damage can be on either side of the brain as opposed to in visual neglect where the damage is always on the right. Society & Culture This condition does not inhibit patients from social interaction. In fact, most people would not be able to distinguish a visual extinction patient from a non-visual extinction patient in passing. Patients have selective spatial interactions, typically within the range of six degrees of the angle of vision. When two visual stimuli are presented to a patient, they can be processed as a single object due to the corresponding neuronal functions which are linked through long-range lateral interactions. Visual Extinction is often mistaken for attentional deficit. Some researchers believe visual extinction may be connected to a restriction in attention capacity. Attention allows a person to identify and react to pertinent objects in space, while ignoring other irrelevant objects. Patients with visual extinction, especially those with unilateral damage to the right parietal lobe, may be unable to attend and orient to objects in collateral space, therefore presenting neglect to visual stimuli. A delay in reaction time is observed in many patients, but it is unknown whether this is a primary result of the stroke or resulting from the visual extinction. Detrimental social aspects may be repercussions of the stroke, which caused the visual extinction, but not from the visual extinction condition alone. Visual Extinction and Image Preprocessing Visual extinction has been involved in several studies regarding preprocessing of images in the brain. A study performed by Dr Vuilleumier examined the effect of using faces as the stimulus in studying an extinction event. Subjects were presented with two simultaneous stimuli ‚Äì some combination of a schematic face, a shape, a word, and a scrambled face. Faces in the contralesional field were less likely to be extinguished than other stimuli, but faces in the ipsilesional field appeared to induce more extinction events. The appearance of a face was prioritized in attention, despite the handicap presented of extinction damage.Vuilleumier, P (2000). \\"Faces call for attention: evidence from patients with visual extinction\\". Neuropsychologia 38(5), 693-700. Visual extinction has also been used to demonstrate brain bias towards gestalt processing. When presented with a figure containing illusory contours, patients were able to correctly report the presence of stimuli in both contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres, due to their unconscious processing of the whole field to produce the illusion.Mattingley, JB, Davis, G, Driver, J (1997). \\"Preattentive filling-in of visual surfaces in parietal extinction.\\" Science 275(5300), 671-674. This experiment implied that the attention center prioritizes the visualization of surfaces over other stimuli ‚Äì therefore, although under race model the ipsilesional stimuli should extinguish the contralesional, the creation of the gestalt takes priority over detection of both. Further, a study using Gabor signals (alternating blurred and noisy black and white bars, commonly used by opticians in diagnostic tests) investigated how the orientation of these signals affected their extinction rate.Pavlovskaya, M, Sagi, D, Soroker, N, Ring, H (1997). \\"Visual extinction and cortical connectivity in human vision.\\" Brain Res Cogn Brain Res 6(2), 159-162. Bilateral stimuli were least extinguished when both stimuli were oriented horizontally, although both stimuli being oriented vertically also showed a reduction in extinguishing rate when compared to one stimulus vertical and one horizontal ‚Äì in what could be assumed by the brain to represent two different surfaces. Combining the brain bias towards facial processing and surface discovery, a follow-up study by Dr. Vuilleumier exposed subjects to paired visual stimuli in three phases. In the initial phase, stimuli were simply bilateral pairs, and extinction frequency was measured. In the next stage, the stimuli were surrounded with an oval, so that they appeared to represent eyes in a face. The extinction rate for this appearance was greatly reduced. Finally, the patients were shown the stimuli minus the contextual oval ‚Äì however, the reduced extinction rate persisted, as though the patients had learned to group these stimuli. The effect did not occur when the stimuli were surrounded by a nonoval shape, pointing towards facial processing as being the key to this phenomenon.Vuilleumier, P, Sagiv N (2001). \\"Two eyes make a pair: facial organization and perceptual learning reduce visual extinction.\\" Neuropsychologia 39, 1144-1149. Visual feedback has also been studied in relation to visual extinction. Patients were asked to touch a known target in a darkened room. A light attached to the patient‚Äôs hand was sometimes briefly illuminated, to provide information about where the hand was in relation to the target. In some of these trials, a distracting light was also lit, which induced an extinction event in the patient. Although the patient reported in such cases that he had not seen the indicator light on his hand, their performance was correspondingly better, similar to the results when visual feedback had been available. Although the patient was not cognizant of having received the information, they were able to correctly act upon it, in a manner similar to blindsight.Schenk, T, Schindler, I, McIntosh, RD, Milner, AD (2005). \\"The use of visual feedback is independent of visual awareness: evidence from visual extinction.\\" Experimental Brain Research 167(1), 95-102. Visual extinction has also been researched with regard to the effect of repetition on visual detection rate. Patients were shown a colored (red or green) letter (O or E), one to each visual field, and then asked variably to report the color or shape of one letter or the other. Extinction was found to be increased in the contralesional field when the patient was asked to report on a repeated characteristic ‚Äì if both stimuli had been the same shape, or same color ‚Äì regardless of whether the other characteristic had also been changed. This is another example of repetition blindness.Baylis, GC, Driver, J, Rafal, RD (1993). \\"Visual Extinction and Stimulus Repetition\\". Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 5(4), 453-466. Future & Research Researchers conduct studies involving first-episode stroke patients. These patients typically have unilateral cerebral damage and/or contralateral extinction. Current research is focusing on the more detailed role of the parietal lobe in visual extinction.Alvarez, G, Batelli, L, Carlson, T, Pascual-Leone, A (2009). \\"The role of the parietal lobe in visual extinction studied with transcranial magnetic stimulation\\". Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 21(10), 1946-1955. The ability to understand which factors in visual processing determine whether a contralesional event, occurring on the half of the patient's brain or body opposing the site of a lesion, is observed or eliminated can provide crucial insights connecting to the mechanisms of attention and operation. Routine eye examinations have begun to incorporate the knowledge of visual extinction. Such examinations screen for simple, unsuspected visual field defects or abnormalities, while screening for the more severe extinction, by testing all quadrants of the visual field. Anderson, A, Shuey, N, Wall, M (2009). \\"Rapid confrontation screening for peripheral visual field defects and extinction\\".

She is best known for her poems and short stories about East Prussia, but also for the support she gave to the Nazi Party.  Biography  Agnes Miegel was born on 9 March 1879 in K√∂nigsberg into a Protestant family. Her parents were the merchant Gustav Adolf Miegel and Helene Hofer. Miegel attended the Girls' High School in K√∂nigsberg and then lived between 1894 and 1896 in a guest house in Weimar, where she wrote her first poems. In 1898 she spent three months in Paris. In 1900 she trained as a nurse in a children's hospital in Berlin. Between 1902 and 1904 she worked as an assistant teacher in a girls' boarding school in Bristol, England. In 1904 she attended teacher training in Berlin, which she had to break off because of illness. She also did not complete a course at an agricultural college for girls near Munich. In 1906 she had to return to K√∂nigsberg to care for her sick parents, especially her father, who had become blind. Her mother died in 1913, her father in 1917.Werden und Werk, page 209. As early as 1900 her first publications had drawn the attention of the writer B√∂rries von M√ºnchhausen. Her first bundle of poems was published thanks to his financial support. In later years he was still an untiring promoter of her work. She lived in K√∂nigsberg until just before it was captured in 1945, and wrote poems, short stories and journalistic reports. She also made a few journeys. During the Third Reich she revealed herself as an ardent supporter of the regime. She signed the Gel√∂bnis treuester Gefolgschaft, the 1933 declaration in which 88 German authors vowed faithful allegiance to Adolf Hitler. In the same year she joined the NS-Frauenschaft, the women's wing of the Nazi Party. In 1940 she joined the Nazi party itself.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945, Edition Fischer, Frankfurt am Main, 2009, pages 369-370. In August 1944, in the final stages of World War II, she was named by Adolf Hitler as an \\"outstanding national asset\\" in the special list of the most important German artists who were freed from all war obligations.Oliver Rathkolb: F√ºhrertreu und gottbegnadet. K√ºnstlereliten im Dritten Reich, √ñsterreichischer Bundesverlag, Wien 1991, , page 176. In February 1945 she fled by ship from the approaching Red Army and reached Denmark. After Denmark's liberation on 5 May 1945 she stayed in the Oksb√∏l Refugee Camp until November 1946. In 1946 she returned to Germany, where she was under a publication ban until 1949. In that year a denazification committee issued a declaration of no objection. At first she stayed in Apelern with relations of her former patron B√∂rries von M√ºnchhausen, who had committed suicide in 1945. In 1948, being a refugee, she was assigned a house in Bad Nenndorf, where she kept writing until her death. Agnes Miegel now mainly wrote poems and short stories about East Prussia, the land of her youth. She was considered the voice of the Heimatvertriebene, the German-speaking people who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia and Poland and in parts of Germany annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union after the war, who had to leave when Nazi Germany was defeated. Miegel received the honorary title Mutter Ostpreu√üen (\\"Mother East Prussia\\") from her admirers.The Agnes Miegel Gesellschaft about the honorary title Mutter Ostpreu√üen.Mutter Ostpreu√üen now controversial . She died on 26 October 1964 in a hospital in Bad Salzuflen.  Literary career  Postage stamp, issued in 1979 by the Deutsche Bundespost in honour of Miegel‚Äôs 100th birthday Miegel's first bundle of poems appeared in 1901 and was called Gedichte. By 1945 she had published 33 books of poems, short stories and plays. She also regularly wrote for newspapers (especially the Ostpreu√üische Zeitung) and magazines. In her early career she mainly wrote about universal themes like man's course of life, nature, life in the countryside, the relationship with God and the past (especially the German past). A minority of these poems and stories were set in East Prussia, and these became her most popular works. Her most famous early poem was Die Frauen von Nidden (\\"The Women of Nidden\\", 1907), in which the village of Nidden (present-day Nida in Lithuania) falls victim to a bubonic plague epidemic. The seven women who survive the plague let themselves be buried alive by the drifting sand dunes near the village.About Miegel and \\"Die Frauen von Nidden\\". During the Third Reich National Socialist themes appear in her work: complaints about the \\"heavy yoke\\" borne by cities like Memel and Danzig, which had been separated from Germany after the First World War;In her poems Nachtgespr√§ch (\\"Night talk\\", 1935) and Sonnenwendreigen (\\"Solstice dance\\", 1939), both published in her book Ostland (1940). glorification of the war;In her poem An Deutschlands Jugend (\\"To Germany's youth\\", 1939), also published in Ostland. glorification of the mothers who bear German children.In her poem An die Reichsfrauenf√ºhrerin Scholtz-Klink (1939). But as early as her 1920 poem \\"√úber der Weichsel dr√ºben\\" (\\"On the other side of the Vistula\\") (republished in Ostland)Pages 22-24. she propagated fear of the Poles, who, she suggested, wanted to overrun East Prussia.√úber der Weichsel dr√ºben has been analysed by Frank Bodesohn in Ostexpansion und deutsche Literatur: Verbreitung der Blut-und-Boden-Ideologie aus Hitlers \\"Mein Kampf\\" in der NS-Literatur, GRIN Verlag, Munich, 2012, pages 46-48. She wrote two odes to Adolf Hitler. The first of these, Dem F√ºhrer, was published in 1936 and cited in Werden und Werk (1938), a study of Miegel's life and works.Pages 79/80. Dem F√ºhrer was reprinted under the title Dem Schirmer des Volkes in Dem F√ºhrer: Gedichte f√ºr Adolf Hitler, a bundle of poems by several authors on the occasion of Hitler's 50th birthday on 20 April 1939. The second poem, An den F√ºhrer, is, in Tauber's words, an \\"hysterical adulation\\" of Hitler,Kurt P. Tauber, Beyond Eagle and Swastika: German Nationalism Since 1945, Volume 2, 1967, Page 1255: 'For Agnes Miegel's hysterical adulation of Hitler, see her poem, \\"To the Fuhrer\\", on Hitler's birthday, April 20, 1940.' published as a kind of preface in Ostland. In the Soviet occupation zone in Germany after the Second World War both Werden und Werk and Ostland were forbidden books. To her credit it may be said that her works were free from antisemitism, although by no means free from the Nazis' Blut und Boden ideology.Horst Matzerath about Agnes Miegel's role in Nazi Germany. After her publication ban had been lifted in 1949, she mainly wrote about East Prussia as she remembered it. The title of her first bundle of poems after the war is characteristic: Du aber bleibst in mir (\\"You however stay within me\\"). Her best known stories and poems are melancholic reflections on her Heimat (homeland) that had been destroyed and was now forever out of reach. This is certainly true of her most famous poem, Es war ein Land (\\"That was a country\\", 1949). Blackbourn shows that this was \\"exactly the idealized image that the expellee organisations cultivated ‚Äì as if all had been pastoral harmony until the Red Army marched west, as if the mass flight of Germans had fallen out of a clear blue sky.\\"David Blackbourn, The Conquest Of Nature: Water, Landscape, and the Making of Modern Germany, W. W. Norton & Company, New York, 2007, pages 302-303. She was not vindictive towards the Russians and Poles who had taken possession of East Prussia.Miegel's thoughts about the reconstruction of the Kaliningrad region. In a poem from 1951 she urged her readers nichts als den Ha√ü zu hassen (\\"to hate nothing but hate\\").She wrote this poem, Spruch, on the occasion of the opening of the Gedenkst√§tte des Deutschen Ostens und der Vertreibung (Memorial for Deportation and the Memorial of the German Eastern Provinces) in Burg Castle in Solingen. She refused to account for her doings during the Nazi era. The only thing she was willing to say was: Dies habe ich mit meinem Gott alleine abzumachen und mit niemand sonst (\\"I have to settle this with my God and with no one else\\"). Publications of her works in Germany after 1945 usually omit her works between 1933‚Äì45, propagating the myth of an apolitical author.Peter Davies: Myth, Matriarchy and Modernity: Johann Jakob Bachofen in German Culture 1860‚Äì1945, Walter de Gruyter, 2010, page 364. Miegel's poems usually consist of lines of unequal length, some rhyming and some not. Marcel Reich-Ranicki included three of her poems (Die Schwester, Die Nibelungen and Die Frauen von Nidden) in his anthology of exemplary German literature Kanon lesenswerter deutschsprachiger Werke (Part Gedichte, 2005).  Reputation  The Agnes-Miegel-Haus in Bad Nenndorf During her lifetime Agnes Miegel received several marks of honour. In 1916 she received the Kleist Prize for lyrics and in 1924 was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of K√∂nigsberg. During the Nazi era she was overloaded with marks of honour. In 1933 she joined the writers' section of the Akademie der K√ºnste in Berlin, together with prominent Nazis such as Hanns Johst. They filled the vacancies that had arisen because some members, amongst them Alfred D√∂blin and Thomas Mann, had to give up their seats for not being loyal to the Nazi regime. In 1935 she received the \\"honorary ring\\" of the Allgemeiner Deutscher Sprachverein and in 1936 the Johann-Gottfried-von- Herder-Preis (the predecessor of the Herder Prize). In 1939 she was made an honorary citizen of K√∂nigsberg; in the same year she received the Golden Decoration of the Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth). In 1940 she received the Goethe Prize of the city of Frankfurt. In 1944 Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels put together a \\"Gottbegnadeten-Liste\\" of the most important artists of the Third Reich. A separate list, the Sonderliste der Unersetzlichen K√ºnstler (\\"special list of irreplaceable artists\\"), put together by Hitler himself, mentioned those 25 people whom the Nazi leaders considered as the Third Reich's greatest artists. Agnes Miegel was (with Gerhart Hauptmann and Hanns Johst, among others) ranked as one of the six greatest German writers. The artists on the special list were freed from all war obligations. After the Second World War she received, inter alia, the Westf√§lischer Kulturpreis (1952), the Gro√üer Literaturpreis of the Bayerische Akademie der Sch√∂nen K√ºnste (Bavarian academy of fine arts) (1959) and the Kulturpreis der Landsmannschaft Westpreu√üen (1962). In 1954 she became an honorary citizen of Bad Nenndorf, her place of residence. After her death her house in Bad Nenndorf was rechristened the Agnes-Miegel-Haus. It is now a museum, dedicated to her life and works, and situated in the Agnes-Miegel-Platz (\\"Agnes Miegel Square\\").The Agnes-Miegel- Haus on the website of the city of Bad Nenndorf . In several places in Germany, streets received the name Agnes-Miegel-Stra√üe. A few schools were named Agnes-Miegel-Schule. In 1979 the Deutsche Bundespost issued a postage stamp in honour of her 100th birthday. Commemorative plaque at Agnes Miegel's former dwelling house in K√∂nigsberg/Kaliningrad There is a monument dedicated to Agnes Miegel in Wunstorf. A monument in Bad Nenndorf has been removed in 2015. In Filzmoos near Salzburg there is a plaque dedicated to the Hofers, Miegel's mother's family, who had their roots there. On 26 October 1992 a plaque was put on her former dwelling house in K√∂nigsberg, now Kaliningrad, with texts in German and Russian. Miegel's reputation was badly damaged when her poems to Hitler were rediscovered and published on the internet in the 1990s. Much discussion arose about her Nazi past. As a result, all the schools and many streets that had been named after her have been renamed. For instance, Agnes-Miegel-Schule in Willich was renamed Astrid-Lindgren-Schule in 2008‚ÄòLindgren statt Miegel?‚Äô, January 2008. and the Agnes-Miegel-Stra√üe in St. Arnold in the Steinfurt district was renamed Anne-Frank-Stra√üe in 2010.‚ÄòSchilderwechsel in St. Arnold: Anne Frank statt Agnes Miegel‚Äô, December 2010 . After a lengthy dispute about whether the Miegel monument in Bad Nenndorf should be kept or removed, it was removed in February 2015.‚ÄòMiegel- Tage im Zeichen des Abschieds‚Äô, March 2015.

An IT manager by trade, Jesper Victor Larsen, Kim Milton Nielsen: Ham i sort! , Krop & Sport, vol. 2, 2006 Nielsen is noted for his impressive height of 1.96 m, making him taller than most players. Nielsen began refereeing at 15 years of age, as he wanted to know the Laws of Football. A decade later, he began taking charge of Danish top-flight games, and he was awarded his FIFA international badge in 1988 when he was still in his late 20s. His career includes 154 internationals and 53 UEFA Champions League games. In 1993, he earned his first major UEFA call-up for the UEFA Super Cup first leg between SV Werder Bremen and FC Barcelona. An appointment for a final followed the next year - the 1994 UEFA Cup final first leg between SV Austria Salzburg and Inter Milan. Nielsen refereed the Russia-Germany match at UEFA Euro 96 in England, and followed this up with duty at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. He took charge of two matches, including the clash between England and Argentina in Saint-√âtienne, where he is remembered for sending off England's David Beckham for kicking out at Argentina's Diego Simeone after the Argentinian had fouled him. England went on to lose the match on penalties, and Beckham was blamed and vilified by the English tabloids for causing the loss as a result of his sending-off. He was noted as the newsmaker of June 1998 on the BBC website where he gave his thoughts about the match and Beckham's sending off.June: The England-Argentina referee, BBC News, December 22, 1998 At UEFA Euro 2000, Nielsen was put in charge of the Germany-Romania and Turkey-Belgium encounters, although the latter match ended in disappointment as he was forced out of the competition with a leg injury.Referee Nielsen forced out of finals, BBC Sport, 20 June 2000 He was replaced by G√ºnter Benk√∂.

Design and development In 1964, an agreement was signed between Poland and the Soviet Union assigning production of the Mil Mi-2 twin-engined light helicopter exclusively to the WSK PZL-≈öwidnik factory at ≈öwidnik, Poland. Work on a significantly redesigned version of the Mi-2 started in 1977. PZL decided to develop, in conjunction with the American aero-engine company Allison, a re- engined version for export for western markets, the Kania or Kitty Hawk. The changes include a modified fuselage with more pointed nose, new engines (Allison Model 250-C20B turboshaft engines) each rated at , new composite rotors blades, and new western avionics. The first prototype, utilizing a modified Mi-2 airframe, was flown on 3 June 1979. Two prototypes were made and two pre-series machines. Tests conducted during the early 1980s led to certification according to FAR-29, in February 1986. The prototype SP-SSC took part in the 5th Helicopter World Championships in Castle Ashby in 1986. A production started that year in small numbers, in the PZL ≈öwidnik factory. The helicopter was to be a replacement of the Mi-2, more economical, comfortable and offering better performance, and it compared quite favourably with Western counterparts. It did not become popular, however, partly due to problems with certification and a weak promotion in Western countries, and reluctance to spend convertible currency for imported parts in Eastern Bloc countries in the 1980s. Only 19 were built until 2006, including prototypes.

It was given this name by Charles Alured Jeffreys, (1821‚Äì1904) of Glandyfi, Machynlleth, Wales. He farmed this area after being given freehold by his father-in-law Thomas Parr in 1851, who was granted Rural Section 188 from the Canterbury Association. Jeffreys also took a further leasehold.Electoral Roll for the District of Christchurch, 5 July 1853, Lyttelton Times, Volume III, Issue 132, 16 July 1853, Page 8 He and his wife Clara Ellen emigrated on the Tasmania arriving in Lyttelton in 1853.Retrieved 26 July 2012 His land, sections 503 and 504,Electoral Roll for the District of Christchurch, 5 July 1853, The Press, Volume IV, Issue 454, 13 April 1864, Page 3 was known as Bryndwr Farm, Fendall Town.

Christchurch City Libraries Digital Maps, CCLMaps 141654, Retrieved 17 September 2012 The farm owned by William Warner of Warner's Hotel in the Norman's Road area of Bryndwr was subdivided, and the Normans Road shops included the Warner farmhouse. In about 1957, the Roper's Foodmarket in this group of shops was designed by local architect Paul Pascoe. Land was further subdivided during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, and these streets were laid out in the sinuous nested form of the Radburn design. The subdivision included the land that was the Bateman farm, on Greers Road, and extended between what is now Memorial Avenue, and Wairakei Road, and north of Wairakei Road including around the Greer homestead built in 1878, at what is now 302 Greers Road, and land owned by Christ's College, Christchurch. Street names from this period of subdivision included notable politicians (Attlee, Truman, Evatt, Eden), Otago landmarks (Earnslaw, Hollyford, Hooker, Aorangi, Lyall, Sealy), names associated with Christ's College, (Blanch, Bourne, Condell, Hudson, Flower, Harris, Merton, Moreland, Richards, Tothill), and , (Bounty, Resolution, Pitcairn, Christian). The houses along Wayside Avenue included exhibition homes. Demographics According to the 2006 census, Bryndwr has a more multicultural demographic than the average for the Canterbury region, with slightly higher percentages of Asian, Middle eastern, and Pacific ethnicity, a higher proportion of people born overseas, and of those who speak a second language. There is also a higher proportion of professional people, as well as single parents and unemployed people. Bryndwr includes a small pocket of low socio-economic households,John Wilson.

In telecommunications, a message exchange pattern (MEP) describes the pattern of messages required by a communications protocol to establish or use a communication channel. There are two major message exchange patterns ‚Äî a request‚Äìresponse pattern, and a one-way pattern. For example, HTTP is a request‚Äìresponse pattern protocol, and UDP is a one-way pattern. SOAP The term \\"Message Exchange Pattern\\" has a specific meaning within the Simple Object Access protocol (SOAP).http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/#soapmep SOAP MEPs in SOAP W3C Recommendation v1.2Web Services Description Language (WSDL) Version 2.0: Additional MEPs SOAP MEP types include: #In-Only: This is equivalent to one- way. A standard one-way messaging exchange where the consumer sends a message to the provider that provides only a status response. #Robust In-Only: This pattern is for reliable one-way message exchanges. The consumer initiates with a message to which the provider responds with status. If the response is a status, the exchange is complete, but if the response is a fault, the consumer must respond with a status. #In-Out: This is equivalent to request‚Äìresponse. A standard two-way message exchange where the consumer initiates with a message, the provider responds with a message or fault and the consumer responds with a status. #In-Optional-Out: A standard two-way message exchange where the provider's response is optional. #Out-Only: The reverse of In-Only. It primarily supports event notification. It cannot trigger a fault message. #Robust Out-Only: Similar to the out-only pattern, except it can trigger a fault message. The outbound message initiates the transmission. #Out-In: The reverse of In-Out. The provider transmits the request and initiates the exchange. #Out-Optional-In: The reverse of In-Optional-Out. The service produces an outbound message. The incoming message is optional (\\"Optional- in\\"). √òMQ The √òMQ message queueing library provides so-called sockets (a kind of generalization over the traditional IP and Unix sockets) which require indicating a messaging pattern to be used, and are optimized for each pattern. The basic √òMQ patterns are:√òMQ User Guide *Request‚Äìreply connects a set of clients to a set of services. This is a remote procedure call and task distribution pattern. *Publish‚Äìsubscribe connects a set of publishers to a set of subscribers. This is a data distribution pattern. *Push‚Äìpull connects nodes in a fan-out / fan-in pattern that can have multiple steps, and loops. This is a parallel task distribution and collection pattern. *Exclusive pair connects two sockets in an exclusive pair. This is a low-level pattern for specific, advanced use cases. Each pattern defines a particular network topology. Request-reply defines so-called \\"service bus\\", publish-subscribe defines \\"data distribution tree\\", push-pull defines \\"parallelised pipeline\\".

It was founded in 1922. Since 2009, in liquidation - does not conduct production activities. In 1970, workers of Gdynia Shipyard rose up against the ruling Polish Communist Party. About 20 people died fighting with army and police in the streets of Gdynia during the Polish 1970 protests. That had a great influence on creating the Solidarity movement in 1980. In 1998 it bought the Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard. The current name is Stocznia Gdynia S.A. History The shipyard was founded in 1922, initially building small coastal vessels. The construction of its first larger ship, , was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. During the German occupation, the shipyard was taken over by Deutsche Werke company and used to repair warships. Later in the war it built sections of Type XXI U-boats. After sustaining bombing damage during World War II the shipyard was rebuilt and expanded. In 1963, its first dry dock was finished, with dimensions 240 √ó 40 m. Second drydock with dimensions 380 √ó 70 m was finished in 1976. The liquidation Since March 2009, according to the so-called law \\"specustawa stoczniowa\\" was started the process of compensation Gdynia Shipyard, which meant the elimination of legal terms, the total sale of assets yard in the open tender and redundancies involving all employees. The money from the sale will be given to the repayment of the yard's creditors - public and private, and the obligations of public law, including ZUS. The last launch took place on 25 April 2009, and the dismissal of employees was conducted at the end of May 2009. =The search for an investor= On May 2009, the Stichting Particulier Fonds Greenrights bought key assets of the shipyards of Gdynia and Szczecin, and on June 17 received guarantees of the Arab Bank, Qatar Islamic Bank. The investor had to pay for the assets of Gdynia Shipyard more than 287 million PLN. On June 25, 2009 the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration issued a formal agreement on the sale of assets of Stocznia Gdynia SA, necessary for entities outside the European Economic Area. Polish Shipyards Company was registered by the Warsaw court on July 21. Its share capital amounted to 100 000 z≈Ç.

Since Oct. 2018, the Center for Infectious Disease Research has been part of the Seattle Children's Research Institute and known as the Center for Global Infectious Disease Research. At the time of the merger, CID Research had 166 scientists. Its mission was to eliminate the world's most devastating infectious diseases through leadership in scientific discovery. The organization's research labs were in the South Lake Union area of Seattle, WA. The institute's research focused on four areas of infectious disease: HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and Emerging & Neglected Diseases (END) like African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and toxoplasmosis. CID Research was engaged in early stages of the scientific pipeline including bench science and malaria clinical trials and has expertise in immunology, vaccinology, and drug discovery. History Seattle BioMed headquarters on Westlake Avenue In 1976, founders Ruth W. Shearer, Ph.D., and Kenneth Stuart, Ph.D., set up a research laboratory in Issaquah, WA. Originally called the Issaquah Group for Health and Environmental Research, the name was soon changed to Issaquah Biomedical Research Institute. Scientists at the Institute studied parasites including ones that cause malaria and African sleeping sickness. In 1986, the Institute relocated to Seattle, Washington to enhance its scientific programs and became Seattle Biomedical Research Institute. In January 2012, Alan Aderem, Ph.D. became president of Seattle BioMed, only the second in its 36-year history, with Dr. Stuart remaining in an active role as President Emeritus and Founder. As part of the Institute's plan for scientific expansion, Dr. Aderem led the implementation of integrating systems biology approaches to understanding infectious disease. In April 2017, Dr. John Aitchison became the organization's third president and director. The organization's name was changed to the Center for Infectious Disease Research in April 2015 to better reflect its focus. Its merger with Seattle Children's Research Institute was announced in July 2018 and finalized on Oct. 1. Research The Center for Infectious Disease Research performed research on four areas of infectious disease:HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and Emerging & Neglected Diseases (END) like African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and toxoplasmosis. Seattle is a hub for global health research, and in July 2012, Seattle Magazine honored two Seattle BioMed leaders (Dr. Stuart and Theresa Britschgi, Director of BioQuest) as \\"Top Docs\\" for the work they're doing in research and scientific training. As part of a broad global initiative to fight malaria, CID Research developed its malaria program in 2000, with an initial grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. With a three-pronged approach, the organization's malaria program was focused on vaccine discovery for pregnancy malaria, severe malaria in children, and liver-stage malaria. In 2005, it received two Grand Challenges in Global Health grants to accelerate its malaria research. And in 2011, it was granted another $9 million from the Foundation to support malaria vaccine efforts. In 2010, Dr. Stefan Kappe developed his own malaria vaccine candidate which was a weakened form of the malaria parasite, and that vaccine candidate was undergoing clinical trials at Walter Reed near Washington, D.C. Soon after, in collaboration with PATH's Malaria Vaccine Initiative, CID Research became home to one of four malaria clinical trial centers in the world where treatments and vaccines could be safely tested in humans using the human challenge model. Education & Training One education program offered by CID Research to engage and mobilize the next generation of scientists was BioQuest Academy, a \\"biomedical boot camp\\" for 11th graders with over 60 hours (two weeks) of intensive instruction through a global health curriculum. BioQuest Academy was a STEM career pipeline. In fact, according to a study published in the journal PLOS ONE in 2010, \\"97% of alumni (2005-2008) are attending postsecondary schools throughout North America; eight graduates have already published scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals and/or presented their scientific data at national and international meetings, and 26 have been retained by Seattle BioMed researchers as compensated technicians and interns.\\" References External links *Seattle Biomedical Research Institute *BioQuest *BioQuest Academy Category:Research institutes in Seattle Category:Tuberculosis organizations Category:HIV/AIDS research organisations Category:Malaria Category:Medical research institutes in the United States Category:Medical and health organizations based in Washington (state) ","title":"Center for Infectious Disease Research"},{"id":"2613618","text":"Grunwaldzki Square in 2005 Grunwaldzki Square in 2008 Grunwaldzki Square in 2010 Building Grunwaldzki Centre Plac Grunwaldzki (Grunwald Square, named for the Battle of Grunwald) is a large square and important transit point in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.

Modi's test career started at Lord's in India's first test in England in their tour of England in 1946. He made his debut in a three-day match (22‚Äì25 June 1946), which is best recognised for Sir Alec Bedser's eleven-wicket haul on debut. Incidentally, this test also marked the test debuts of Vijay Hazare and Vinoo Mankad, who would go one to be recognised players for India. Rusi Modi was evidently an accumulator of runs, this fact being evident from his test average of 46 and a first-class average of 53, which also weighed a lot on paper when seen alongside his 20 centuries in the latter respect. He also bowled some medium-pace and even grabbed a five-wicket haul, his only one in all formats of cricket he played in. First-Class Career Modi started his first class career with a century on debut at the age of 17 in a Bombay Pentangular match. In Ranji Trophy between 1943/44 and 1944/45, he scored five hundreds in successive innings for Bombay, seven in successive matches. The sequence read 168 v Maharashtra, 128 v Western India both in 1943/44, 160 v Sind, 210 v Western India, 245* & 31 v Baroda, 113 v Northern India and 98 & 151 v Holkar all in 1944/45. His aggregate of 1008 in only five Ranji matches in 1944/45 was a record which stood for over forty years. He made 1375 runs in all first class matches. Modi was only 20 at the time. Apart from the two double hundreds in Ranji, Modi scored a 215 for Parsees in the 1944/45 season. The next he hit 203 against Australian Services XI, the first double hundred for India in representative matches. Modi considered the finest of all his innings. Modi represented Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, where he enjoyed success, scoring 2196 runs at an average of 81.69. Test career In the wet summer 1946, when India toured England, Modi was somewhat a veteran in the domestic circuit, having made his debut five years earlier and was selected in the Indian team on the back of some impressive performances like scoring 1008 runs at an excellent average of 201 in the 1944‚Äì45 Ranji Trophy season, becoming the first ever player to do so, until W.V. Raman passed that mark, scoring 1018 runs, 44 years later. Modi had already earned a reputation for being a heavy run-maker, as his exploits with the bat made up for impressive watching: centuries in seven consecutive Ranji matches for Bombay in the seasons of 1943‚Äì44 and 1944‚Äì45, three double- centuries in 1944‚Äì45 (the same season when he amassed over a thousand runs), and a fourth the following year against the Australian Services team. Thus, it was not a real surprise when Modi was selected in the team. When the match started, India found themselves in dire straits as their scorecard read 44‚Äì3, when Modi walked in. He immediately flashed at leg spinner Doug Wright, but was dropped by Wally Hammond. Thereafter, he played well to score 57*. As recounted by Vijay Hazare in the book 'A long Innings', \\"Modi nonchalantly gave a thumbs up to the Indian dressing room(after the drop), and proceeded to play some delightful strokes\\". Modi enjoyed moderate success in the three- match series, scoring 137 runs from 5 innings at an average of 34.25, but was the fifth-highest run-scorer in the series, behind Vijay Merchant, Joe Hardstaff Jr, Denis Compton, and Cyril Washbrook. However, he performed better overall, scoring 1196 runs in the tour at an average of 37.37. In the West Indies tour of India in 1948‚Äì49, Modi performed excellently, scoring 560 in five Tests with a hundred and five fifties. The 112 he scored against the West Indies in the Brabourne Stadium was his only test century, and it came in his fifth test, and in the second match of the series. Modi was consistent throughout the whole series, scoring excess of 90 thrice in a match. His 112 in Bombay saw him forge an important partnership with Vijay Hazare, the most important of them being 139, when India chased 361 in the final Test. He was involved in four century stands with Hazare in the whole series. Thereafter his career was affected by his professional commitments. He played for Bombay till 1957/58 and captained the side against Maharashtra in one match in 1952/53. In ten unofficial Tests, he made 565 runs at an average of 35.31. Personality Described in John Arlott's words as being \\"...tall, painfully thin, grey of face and huddled into an overcoat, tending to tremble...\\", while noting the difference between the Modi on the field and off it. Six feet tall and very thin, he was quick on his feet and his cover drive was a stroke of exquisite timing and flawless beauty . He was a better player of spin than pace. Trivia Modi was good at table tennis and represented Maharashtra in inter-state matches. He took part in intercollegiate tennis and badminton tournaments. Modi wrote several books starting with Cricket Forever in 1964. He served as the ADC to the Bombay Governor Raja Maharaja Singh and later became a highly placed executive in the Associated Cement Company. He died of a cardiac arrest while in the Cricket Club of India pavilion at the Brabourne Stadium.

It is roughly bounded by Roosevelt Boulevard to the south, Tacony Creek to the east, Godfrey Avenue to the north, and the railroad right-of-way west of Seventh Street to the west. Although Olney is primarily a quiet residential neighborhood, portions do serve as major commercial centers for many surrounding groups. 5th Street has a Korean-American business district in the vicinity of Olney Avenue, and Hispanic businesses flourish in the southern reaches of the neighborhood. Fisher Park is located in Olney. It is a public park which was laid out and owned by Joseph Wharton, founder of Swarthmore College and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. It was donated to the city by Joseph in 1908 as a \\"Christmas gift\\" to Philadelphia. Fisher Park has a football field, basketball and tennis courts, and a wooded hiking area. Olney is named after the estate of Alexander Wilson (not the ornithologist), who resided on Rising Sun Avenue, near Tacony Creek. Wilson chose the name for his residence because of his love for the poet William Cowper, of Olney, England. The mansion was demolished in 1924, but the name was applied to the growing village nearby. History Up until the late nineteenth century, Olney was a vast, hilly farmland in the hinterland of Philadelphia County. Until then, the population consisted mainly of farmers and wealthy Philadelphians who could afford to live away from the city. As the city of Philadelphia grew northwards, the area became more urbanized. People seeking to escape the growing population density towards the center moved to Olney. Soon thereafter, businesses began appearing, largely centered at 5th Street and Olney Avenue. Industry was also attracted and companies such as Heintz Manufacturing Company, Proctor and Schwartz, and Brown Instrument Division built factories in the neighborhood. But this took second place to the strong commercial district, led by the Olney Businessmans' Association. The population grew even more after the construction of the Broad Street subway which had its original terminal at Olney Avenue (Olney Transportation Center). It promised to get riders from Olney to City Hall in less than twenty minutes for fifteen cents. In addition to trolley lines that traveled east and west, this made Olney Philadelphia's northern transportation hub and gave Olneyites easy access to the entire city and beyond. In 1925, Colney Theatre was constructed which then had the largest one-floor seating capacity in the world with room for almost 2000 people. In 1931, Olney High School graduated its first class and for a time had the largest enrollment in the city with 3600 students. Olney High School's alumni include Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Del Ennis (1942), comedy writer Barry S. Waronker (1965), local news reporter Sheila Washington (1982), and former Feltonville historian Dennis Dalbey (1994). Olneyites lobbied the city intensely for the constructions of playgrounds and the library at 5th Street and Tabor Road. Community members put together an amateur Olney Symphony Orchestra (which continues to give concerts) and started their own newspaper, the Olney Times (which is no longer in circulation as of 2010). Between the 1960s and 1980s, Olney began experiencing demographic change, as European-American residents moved out of the neighborhood in a process sometimes described as \\"white flight\\". As part of the deindustrialization of Philadelphia, industry closed factories and moved from the area. During this time there was an increase in crime in Olney. The receding population was quickly supplemented by a new wave of residents, including African Americans from elsewhere in the city, and immigrants from Asia (Korea, mainly, as well as Vietnam, China, Cambodia and Laos) and Latin America (Puerto Rico, Colombia, Mexico, Cuba and Dominican Republic). This new population quickly filled the vacancies left behind in the commercial district. These groups created organizations such as the Korean Community Development Services Center. By the mid-1980s Koreans began moving out of Logan and into Olney and other communities. By 1986 up to 5,000 Koreans lived in Olney, and many Korean businesses were situated along North Fifth Street. Many Korean area residents referred to the area as \\"Koreatown.\\"Kaufman, Marc. \\"'Koreatown': From Logan Into Olney.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer. July 13, 1986.

There are thriving business districts at 5th and Olney, Broad and Olney, and Front and Olney. The Adams Avenue Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Education =Primary and secondary schools= Public schools Olney, as with all areas in Philadelphia, is zoned to the School District of Philadelphia. Olney has six public elementary schools: * Lowell * Finletter * Morrison * Grover Washington, Jr. * Marshall * Olney Olney has two general zoned public high schools. Toward the southern reaches of the neighborhood Olney High School is the prime school. Samuel Fels High School is now accepting students living in the northern reaches of the neighborhood after violence in Olney High School became too prevalent. Central High School, the Philadelphia High School for Girls, and The Widener Memorial School are located in Logan, a neighborhood that borders Olney. Private schools There are several private and parochial schools in Olney. Elementary schools include Saint Helena-Incarnation Regional Elementary School as of September 2012 merging Incarnation Catholic School & Saint Helena, and Olney Christian School which opened in September, 2012. Area high schools include International Christian High School, which used to be Cedar Grove Christian Academy. Prior to its closing in 2010, Olney was the home of Cardinal Dougherty High School which was once the largest Roman Catholic high school in the United States. =Public libraries= The Free Library of Philadelphia operates the Greater Olney Branch.\\"Greater Olney Branch.\\" Free Library of Philadelphia. Retrieved on November 7, 2008. =Higher education= La Salle University borders Olney, Nicetown-Tioga and Germantown. Though the university is mostly considered within the borders of the Ogontz or Belfield neighborhoods, La Salle is sometimes erroneously labelled as in the Olney neighborhood, as its campus is located on 20th and Olney Avenue. As a result, local media, students, or faculty will incorrectly refer to La Salle as in the Olney section of Philadelphia. Demographics Olney was originally settled by German Americans, and maintained an homogeneous population throughout the first half of the 20th century. Today, Olney is one of the most diverse middle class neighborhoods in Philadelphia, with the 2nd largest Mexican population only behind South Philadelphia. It is also home to large Colombians, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Cambodians, African Americans, Koreans, Sub-Saharan Africans, West Indians, Hispanics, and Arab Americans communities as well as other smaller groups representing other nationalities and ethnic groups. As of the census of 2010, the racial makeup of Olney was 49.5% African American, 26.3% Hispanic or Latino, 13.9% Asian, 6.9% White, and roughly 3% Multiracial. After growing modestly during the 1990s, the population of Olney decreased by 2.3% between 2000 and 2010 (from 37,366 to 36,474). Olney is located in the 19120 postal zip code, which it shares with Feltonville and Lawncrest. Its geographical coordinates are 40.034254 degrees North and 75.121256 degrees West. In 2005, the median home sale price in the 19120 zip code was $79,950. This was an increase of 20% over the median price for 2004. In popular culture The majority of M. K. Asante's bestselling memoir Buck takes place in Olney.

Cylinder sets are particularly useful in providing the base of the natural topology of the product of a countable number of copies of a set. If V is a finite set, then each element of V can be represented by a letter, and the countable product can be represented by the collection of strings of letters. General definition Given a collection S of sets, consider the Cartesian product \\\\textstyle X = \\\\prod_{Y\\\\in S} Y\\\\, of all sets in the collection. The canonical projection corresponding to some Y\\\\in S is the function p_{Y} : X \\\\to Y that maps every element of the product to its Y component. A cylinder set is a preimage of a canonical projection or finite intersection of such preimages. Explicitly, it is a set of the form, :\\\\bigcap_{i=1}^n p_{Y_i}^{-1} \\\\left(A_{i}\\\\right)= \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left(x\\\\right) \\\\in X \\\\mid x_{Y_1} \\\\in A_1, \\\\dots,x_{Y_n}\\\\in A_n\\\\right\\\\\\\\} for any choice of n, finite sequence of sets Y_1,...Y_n\\\\in S and subsets A_{i} \\\\subseteq Y_i for 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n. Here x_Y\\\\in Y denotes the Y component of x\\\\in X. Then, when all sets in S are topological spaces, the product topology is generated by cylinder sets corresponding to the components' open sets. That is cylinders of the form \\\\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}p_{Y_i}^{-1}\\\\left(U_i\\\\right) where for each i, U_i is open in Y_i. In the same manner, in case of measurable spaces, the cylinder œÉ-algebra is the one which is generated by cylinder sets corresponding to the components' measurable sets. For a countable product, the cylinder œÉ-algebra is the product œÉ-algebra. The restriction that the cylinder set be the intersection of a finite number of open cylinders is important; allowing infinite intersections generally results in a finer topology. In the latter case, the resulting topology is the box topology; cylinder sets are never Hilbert cubes. Cylinder sets in products of discrete sets Let S = \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\} be a finite set, containing n objects or letters. The collection of all bi-infinite strings in these letters is denoted by :S^\\\\mathbb{Z}=\\\\\\\\{ x=(\\\\ldots, x_{-1}, x_0, x_1, \\\\ldots) : x_k \\\\in S \\\\; \\\\forall k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\\\\\}. The natural topology on S is the discrete topology. Basic open sets in the discrete topology consist of individual letters; thus, the open cylinders of the product topology on S^\\\\mathbb{Z} are :C_t[a]= \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in S^\\\\mathbb{Z} : x_t = a \\\\\\\\}. The intersections of a finite number of open cylinders are the cylinder sets :\\\\begin{align} C_t[a_0, \\\\ldots, a_m] & = C_t[a_0] \\\\,\\\\cap\\\\, C_{t+1}[a_1] \\\\,\\\\cap \\\\cdots \\\\cap\\\\, C_{t+m}[a_m]  & = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in S^\\\\mathbb{Z} : x_t = a_0, \\\\ldots ,x_{t+m} = a_m \\\\\\\\} \\\\end{align}. Cylinder sets are clopen sets. As elements of the topology, cylinder sets are by definition open sets. The complement of an open set is a closed set, but the complement of a cylinder set is a union of cylinders, and so cylinder sets are also closed, and are thus clopen. Definition for vector spaces Given a finite or infinite-dimensional vector space V over a field K (such as the real or complex numbers), the cylinder sets may be defined as :C_A[f_1, \\\\ldots, f_n] = \\\\\\\\{x\\\\in V : (f_1(x),f_2(x),\\\\ldots,f_n(x))\\\\in A \\\\\\\\} where A\\\\subset K^n is a Borel set in K^n, and each f_j is a linear functional on V; that is, f_j\\\\in (V^*)^{\\\\otimes n}, the algebraic dual space to V. When dealing with topological vector spaces, the definition is made instead for elements f_j\\\\in (V^\\\\prime)^{\\\\otimes n}, the continuous dual space. That is, the functionals f_j are taken to be continuous linear functionals. Applications Cylinder sets are often used to define a topology on sets that are subsets of S^\\\\mathbb{Z} and occur frequently in the study of symbolic dynamics; see, for example, subshift of finite type. Cylinder sets are often used to define a measure, using the Kolmogorov extension theorem; for example, the measure of a cylinder set of length m might be given by 1/m or by 1/2m. Cylinder sets may be used to define a metric on the space: for example, one says that two strings are Œµ-close if a fraction 1‚àíŒµ of the letters in the strings match. Since strings in S^\\\\mathbb{Z} can be considered to be p-adic numbers, some of the theory of p-adic numbers can be applied to cylinder sets, and in particular, the definition of p-adic measures and p-adic metrics apply to cylinder sets. These types of measure spaces appear in the theory of dynamical systems and are called nonsingular odometers. A generalization of these systems is Markov odometer. Cylinder sets over topological vector spaces are the core ingredient in the formal definition of the Feynman path integral or functional integral of quantum field theory, and the partition function of statistical mechanics.

He was the Prince of L√ºneburg and ruled the L√ºneburg-Celle subdivision of the Welf family's Brunswick-L√ºneburg duchy from 1520 until his death. He was the son of Henry I, Duke of L√ºneburg, and Margarete of Saxony, the daughter of Ernest, Elector of Saxony.  Life  Ernest was born in Uelzen of the House of Guelph on 27 June 1497. His father was Henry I of L√ºneburg and his mother Margarete of Saxony who was a sister of Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony and Champion of Martin Luther. Ernest succeeded as Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg upon the retirement of his brother Otto in 1527. Ernest, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, married Sophia of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and he died on 11 January 1547 at the age of 49. Ernest's life coincided with the Protestant Reformation. In 1512 he was sent to the court of his mother's brother at Wittenberg, the Wettin elector Frederick III (Frederick the Wise), and received instruction there from Georg Spalatin in the University of Wittenberg; he remained at Wittenberg through the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. In 1520, political frictions with Charles V convinced his father, Henry I of Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg to abdicate and leave for the French Court which was ardently Catholic. Henry's two eldest sons, Otto and Ernest, became regents of the country. At the urging of the Catholic forces, Henry returned to L√ºneberg in 1527 and tried to regain control. But Henry's attempt failed and he returned to France. Henry was allowed to return in 1530 to spend his last days in the princely house in L√ºneberg given to him by his eldest son. Henry's eldest son Otto (24 August 1495 ‚Äì 11 August 1549), who also had been educated with his brothers at Wittenberg, succeeded as Duke of Brunswick- L√ºneburg; he was also the Prince of L√ºneburg from 1520 to 1527 and Baron of Harburg from 1527 to 1549. Otto and Ernest appear to have ruled jointly from 1520 to 1527. But with the retirement of Otto, Ernest became sole ruler. The condition of his domain was not prosperous. =Introduction of the Reformation to Brunswick-L√ºneburg= Political considerations furthered the introduction of the Reformation; amongst the commoners it offered opportunity to restrict the privileges of the nobles and the clergy. From the nobles point of view, the Reformation offered the chance to gain from church and monastery property. The forerunner of the Reformation in L√ºneburg was Wolf Cyclop, a physician from Zwickau, who was not free from the Zwickau enthusiasm. Moderates such as Gottschalk Cruse, Heinrich Bock, and Matth√§us Mylow followed him. Ernest was inclined to move slowly, but by 1525 the German Peasants' War gave him occasion to join with his brother in requiring the monasteries to declare their properties and to require them to admit Protestant preachers. Ernest had also promised his uncle, the elector of Saxony to stand by the Protestant cause. After an attempt by the Roman Catholic party in 1527 to reinstate his father had failed, Ernest's course became more decided as he succeeded as Duke. In July 1527, the first book of discipline was adopted, drawn up by the preachers of Celle. At a diet in August of the same year it was ordered that \\"God's pure word should be preached everywhere without additions made by men.\\" Between 1527 and 1530, Lutheran preachers were introduced in most parishes and monasteries‚Äînot in all cases without compulsion. Ernest went to Augsburg in 1530 and signed the Confession. He brought back Urbanus Rhegius, who worked to spread the Reformation, introducing it into the city of L√ºneburg. The largest and richest monastery in the land, St. Michael's in L√ºneburg, accepted the new order after the death of Abbot Boldewin in 1532. Rhegius died in 1541 and was succeeded by Martin Ondermark, who completed the former's work. Generally, the preachers were well disposed to the reformed religion, while the people held to the old and only gradually adapted themselves to the new. During the Schmalkald War the greater masses remained true to the Gospel. After 1530, Ernest was the most influential prince of North Germany. He sent Rhegius to Hanover when the Reformation there threatened to become revolution and restored order. In the cities of Westphalia he strengthened the Protestant party against both the Roman Catholics and the enthusiasts, although his efforts were vain in M√ºnster. His influence was also felt in Pomerania and Mecklenburg, in Hoya, and in East Friesland. =Schmalkald League= Ernest's most effective work probably was accomplished by his restless activity for the Schmalkald League. He induced the North German cities, Hamburg, Bremen, Brunswick, G√∂ttingen, and others to join, and he often became the successful mediator when a rupture was threatened between the overcautious elector of Saxony and the headstrong Philip of Hesse. While Ernest sometimes used harsh measures to accomplish his will, and was actuated by a desire to exalt his position as ruler as well as by higher motives, yet, on the whole, he was faithful to his motto, \\"aliis inserviendo consumor\\" (\\"consumed in service of others\\"), alternatively appearing as \\"aliis servio; me ipsum contero\\" (\\"I serve others; I wear myself out\\"). His four sons at his death were still minors, but the Protestant Church of L√ºneburg was so firmly established that it could survive the regency and the unhappy time of the Schmalkald War, and to this day the church life of L√ºneburg bears the character impressed upon it by Ernest who is now called Ernest the Confessor.  Ancestry   Children  Ernest married Sophia, daughter of Henry V, Duke of Mecklenburg and Ursula of Brandenburg, on 2 June 1528 in Schwerin. They had the following children who reached adulthood: *Francis Otto, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (1530‚Äì1559), married Elisabeth Magdalena of Brandenburg, daughter of Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg and Hedwig of Poland. *Frederick (1532‚Äì1553) *Henry III, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (1533‚Äì1598) married Ursula of Saxe-Lauenberg, daughter of Francis I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg *Margaret (1534‚Äì1596), married John, Count of Mansfeld See *William VI, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (1535‚Äì1592), married Dorothea of Denmark, daughter of Christian III of Denmark. *Elizabeth Ursula (1539‚Äì1586), married Otto IV of Schaumburg *Magdalena Sophia (1540‚Äì1586), married Arnold, Count of Bentheim-Steinfurt, a brother of Eberwin III, Count of Bentheim-Steinfurt *Sophia (1541‚Äì1631), married Poppo XVIII, Count of Henneberg-Schleusingen  References  *Ernest at the House of Welf site *Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, vol. 6, p. 260 * Category:1497 births Category:1546 deaths Category:People from Uelzen Category:Princes of L√ºneburg Category:Converts to Lutheranism from Roman Catholicism Category:Middle House of L√ºneburg ","title":"Ernest I, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg"},{"id":"2613679","text":"Yuvaraja Sri Sir Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wadiyar (5 June 1888 ‚Äì 11 March 1940), was the heir apparent of the princely state of Mysore from 1895 until his death in 1940.

In 1894, when he was six years of age, his father died. His mother served as Queen Regent of Mysore between 1894 and 1902 during the minority of his elder brother, Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar. Narasimharaja Wodeyar's only son, Jayachamaraja Wadiyar, was to be the 25th and the last Maharaja of Mysore (1940‚Äì1950). An intelligent student, Narasimharaja Wodeyar had his early education at the private royal school of Mysore (functioning from Lokaranjan Mahal, a.k.a. \\"summer palace\\" in Mysore). His education and training was entrusted to Sir Stuart Fraser, Mr. P. Raghavendra Rao and others. He was later sent to Mayo College, Ajmer. After becoming very sick during his stay at Mayo College, he returned to Mysore and pursued his studies and training under Captain Heale.

It could also be described as a stem with a well developed root system, to which a bud from another plant is grafted. It can refer to a rhizome or underground stem. In grafting, it refers to a plant, sometimes just a stump, which already has an established, healthy root system, onto which a cutting or a bud from another plant is grafted. In some cases, such as vines of grapes and other berries, cuttings may be used for rootstocks, the roots being established in nursery conditions before planting them out. The plant part grafted onto the rootstock is usually called the scion. The scion is the plant that has the properties that propagator desires above ground, including the photosynthetic activity and the fruit or decorative properties. The rootstock is selected for its interaction with the soil, providing the roots and the stem to support the new plant, obtaining the necessary soil water and minerals, and resisting the relevant pests and diseases. After a few weeks the tissues of the two parts will have grown together, eventually forming a single plant. After some years it may be difficult to detect the site of the graft although the product always contains the components of two genetically different plants. The use of rootstocks is most commonly associated with fruiting plants and trees, and is useful for mass propagating many other types of plants that do not breed true from seed, or are particularly susceptible to disease when grown on their own roots. Although grafting has been practiced for many hundreds of years, even in Roman times, most orchard rootstocks in current use were developed in the 20th century. A variety of rootstocks may be used for a single species or cultivar of scion because different rootstocks impart different properties, such as vigour, fruit size and precocity. Rootstocks also may be selected for traits such as resistance to drought, root pests, and diseases. Grapevines for commercial planting are most often grafted onto rootstocks to avoid damage by phylloxera, though vines available for sale to back garden viticulturists may not be. The rootstock may be a different species from the scion, but as a rule it should be closely related, for example, many commercial pears are grown on quince rootstock. Grafting can also be done in stages; a closely related scion is grafted to the rootstock, and a less closely related scion is grafted to the first scion. Serial grafting of several scions may also be used to produce a tree that bears several different fruit cultivars, with the same rootstock taking up and distributes water and minerals to the whole system. Those with more than three varieties are known as 'family trees'. When it is difficult to match a plant to the soil in a certain field or orchard, growers may graft a scion onto a rootstock that is compatible with the soil. It may then be convenient to plant a range of ungrafted rootstocks to see which suit the growing conditions best; the fruiting characteristics of the scion may be considered later, once the most successful rootstock has been identified. Rootstocks are studied extensively and often are sold with a complete guide to their ideal soil and climate. Growers determine the pH, mineral content, nematode population, salinity, water availability, pathogen load and sandiness of their particular soil, and select a rootstock which is matched to it. Genetic testing is increasingly common, and new cultivars of rootstock are always being developed. AxR1 AxR1 is a grape rootstock once widely used in California viticulture. Its name is an abbreviation for \\"Aramon Rupestris Ganzin No. 1\\", which in turn is based on its parentage: a cross (made by a French grape hybridizer named Ganzin) between Aramon, a Vitis vinifera cultivar, and Rupestris, an American grape species, Vitis rupestrisalso used on its own as rootstock, \\"Rupestris St. George\\" or \\"St. George,\\" referring to a town in the South of France, Saint Georges d'Orques, where it was popular. It achieved a degree of notoriety in California when, after decades of recommendation as a preferred rootstockdespite repeated warnings from France and South Africa about its susceptibility (it had failed in Europe in the early 1900s)it ultimately succumbed to phylloxera in the 1980s, requiring the replanting of most of Napa and Sonoma, with disastrous financial consequences. Those who resisted the urge to use AxR-1, such as David Bennion of Ridge Vineyards, saw their vineyards spared from phylloxera damage.  Apple rootstock  Apple rootstocks are used for apple trees and are often the deciding factor of the size of the tree that is grafted on to the root. Dwarfing, semi-dwarf, semi-standard and standard are the size benchmarks for the different sizes of roots that will be grown, with standard being the largest and dwarf being the smallest. Much of the world's apple production is now using dwarf rootstocks to improve efficiency, increase density and increase yields of fruit per/acre. The following is a list of the dwarfing rootstock that are commonly used today in apple production: Malling 9 rootstock is the most common and well known dwarfing rootstock. This rootstock should be planted in a well-drained site, and requires staking for the duration of its life. This rootstock is also very susceptible to fireblight and burr knots. There have been many clones made of this rootstock, including M.9 NAKB 337, M.9EMLA and M.9. Pajam. Malling 26 rootstock will grow a larger tree than the M9 rootstock will, and is about 40-50% the size of a standard tree. This root is considered very productive and early bearing, and requires staking in the first few years of its life. Malling 7 rootstock is slightly bigger than an M26 rootstock, and also requires staking in the first several years to establish a centre leader. This rootstock is moderately susceptible to blight and collar rot. The fruit size that M7 produces is good but not as large as an M26, or M9 rootstock. This root is highly susceptible to suckering and leaning over in its later years of life, which is very annoying and causes issues for the producer. Malling 111 rootstock is one of the biggest and vigorous rootstock that is used today in commercial orchards, and is about 80-90% the size of a standard sized tree. It is generally quite winter hardy and produces few burr knots and root suckers. This rootstock is much less popular than it once was, because many commercial producers are now planting higher density orchards, which M111 is not conducive to. Malling 106 rootstock is slightly smaller than M111, but is a very productive tree and has early fruiting abilities. It is a great rootstock to be used in a variety of soil conditions because it is very hardy with moderate vigour. This rootstock must be planted in well-drained soils as it is susceptible to collar rot.

In June 1996, the 100th Sok√≥≈Ç was completed by the company. =Huzar derivative= During the 1990s, PZL-≈öwidnik heavily pursued the development of an envisioned Huzar battlefield helicopter, which was to be based on the airframe of the W-3 Sokol and would have eventually involved the manufacture of 100 such attack helicopters under a tentative $350 million contract for the Polish Army. While the programme was initiated by the company, it was heavily afflicted by repeated setbacks and delays as PZL- ≈öwidnik's financial state worsened as well as the firm often waiting for years for development funds to be issued by the Polish government with which it could formally launch the next phase of development. When a contract for the helicopter's avionics and weapon systems was awarded within a government memorandum of understanding (MoU) to an Israeli consortium, consisting of armaments manufacturer Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and defense electronics company Elbit Systems, making them the intended supplier for both the missiles and avionics for the helicopter.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \\"Take your partners.\\" Flight International, 2 September 1998. During 1998, the Polish Council of Ministers issued its recommendation for the launch of a new tender in support of the envisioned Huzar. Specifically, the tender sought an avionics and weapons systems integrator for the new rotorcraft, potentially replacing the originally selected Israeli consortium due to alleged irregularities involved in the prior arrangement's awarding. American firm Boeing, who led their own bid involving in excess of 20 separate companies, represented Elbit's chief competitor for the integration contract; at one point, it appeared that political changes to the competition had made Boeing the favourite to win the contract.\\"Polish recommendation opens Huzar's avionics door for Boeing.\\" Flight International, 12 August 1998. While Rafael's NT-D anti-tank missile was selected, this was subject to the successful completion of several test launches; if it failed, rival bids from Boeing for the AGM-114 Hellfire, British firm GEC-Marconi with the Brimstone and the Franko-German company Euromissile's HOT 3 missile. The Israeli Government resisted breaking up its consortium for a separate avionics integration contract, stated it would refuse to release the NT-D missile unless it was also awarded the avionics bid, but reportedly softened on this stance. However, during mid-1999, the Polish government's plans for the Huzar helicopter were entirely abandoned, effectively ending development of the derivative immediately. In its place, a smaller fleet of W-3 Sokol, modified for the support role, was to be adopted in the short term instead. Invitations for bids for the upgrading of 50 rotorcraft, including the adoption of new rotor blades, more powerful engines, extra fuel tanks and additional armaments, was issued thereafter. At the time, Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek stated that, for the long term requirement, a new tender for attack helicopter was to be issued by the end of June that year, and \\"we expect a decision in October or November\\"; the envisioned competition was to be contested by the Italian Agusta A129 Mangusta, the American Bell AH-1W/Z Super Cobra and Boeing AH-64 Apache, the European Eurocopter Tiger and South African Denel Rooivalk attack helicopters.\\"Arms makers square up for Polish bidding war.\\" Flight International, 19 May 1999.Simon 2004, p. 92. Poland ultimately chose to pursue a relatively modest stopgap plan to upgrade its existing Mil Mi-24 fleet with Israeli-built equipment.Stewart, Penny.\\"Mobile manoeuvres.\\" Flight International, 28 March 2000.\\"Poland studies Mi-24 upgrade possibility.\\" Flight International, 21 March 2000. =Further development= During the early 2000s, PLZ Swidnik issued an offer for the upgrade of 12 Sokols previously operated by the Polish Air Force in the training role, converting them to perform the search and rescue mission instead; amongst the changes involved was the installation of Rockwell Collins-built ARC-210 transceivers and the adoption of new night- vision goggles (NVG)-compatible cockpits.Jaxa-Malakowski, Ryzsard. \\"SW-4 five- seater goes into series production.\\" Flight International, 1 October 2002. In 2006, this offer was met with a corresponding contract, which would ultimately led to the production of an improved model of the rotorcraft, designated as the W-3PL Gluszec; in addition to the above improvements, a new flight control system and upgraded powerplants featuring full authority digital engine control (FADEC) software, were adopted, along with various changes to the communication, navigation and self-protection systems. The variant, which had been developed partially based upon combat experience gained in Iraq, attracted the attention of the Polish land forces, leading to discussions on modernising additional W-3 helicopters to the Gluszec standard.Hoyle, Craig. \\"PICTURE: Poland receives upgraded W-3PL 'Gluszec' helicopters.\\" Flight International, 14 February 2011. By January 2012, a follow-up order for another four Sokols re-built to the W-3PL configuration had been issued.Glowacki, Bartosz. \\"Warsaw details plans for military helicopter buy.\\" Flight International, 4 January 2012. During the mid-2000s, it was reported that, as part of a wider proposed industrial partnership between PLZ Swidnik and Indonesian aircraft company Indonesian Aerospace (IAe), discussions on the potential outsourcing of manufacturing work on the Sokol helicopter, focused on the airframe and some of the subassemblies, were held; it was also stated that a wider licensing agreement in respect to the Sokol had already been ruled out as IAe were not prepared to accept responsibility for marketing and sales for the helicopter.Sobie, Brendan. \\"Sokol work could go to Indonesia.\\" Flight International, 30 March 2004. Following Anglo-Italian helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland's acquisition of PZL Swidnik, the W-3 Sokol was incorporated into the new parent company's product line and has continued to be marketed and sold.Peruzzi, Luca. \\"FARNBOROUGH: Face the facts with AgustaWestland's Giuseppe Orsi.\\" Flight International, 20 July 2010. Design The PZL W-3 Sok√≥≈Ç is a medium-size, twin-engine, multipurpose rotorcraft. The helicopter employs a relatively conventional design and construction. It is powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney Rzesz√≥w-built PZL-10B turboshaft engines; the original powerplant, the PZL-10W, was based on the earlier PZL-10S ‚Äì a licensed derivative of the Russian-designed Glushenkov TVD-10B turboprop engines which had powered the Polish-built Antonov An-28. Composites are used in the construction of the three-bladed tail and four- bladed main rotors. The Sok√≥≈Ç has been offered in a number of diverse variants and is capable of performing a typical range of helicopter missions, including passenger transport, VIP, cargo, EMS, medevac, firefighting and search and rescue. When used in maritime environments, the rotorcraft is typically outfitted with floats, a transponder, a global positioning system navigation system, night-vision equipment, and a Lucas winch.\\"Swidnik wins Sokol successes.\\" Flight International, 13 September 1995. Operational history The first civilian export customer for the W-3A variant of the type was Germany's Federal Police in Saxony. During 1995, South Korean operator Citiair issued a firm order for the purchase of three transport-orientated W-3A Sok√≥≈Ç helicopters. Citiair chose fit various additional equipment on the type, including floats, as two of them were to routinely travel to the island of Ulleungdo, roughly 180 km (110 miles) from the Korean mainland, while the third was to be operated in the nation's more mountainous regions. During the same year, Polish oil company Petrobaltic ordered a single W-3RM Anaconda maritime helicopter, while primarily designed for search and rescue (SAR) duties, it was used by the company for transporting personnel, supplies and equipment to its Baltic oil drilling platforms. The Polish military has been a key customer for the Sokol. During the mid-1990s, a 15-year modernisation plan called for the procurement of 90 transport-orientated Sokols, along with 100 Huzar battlefield helicopter (a later-cancelled derivative of the Sokol).Simon 2004, p. 67. During the mid-1990s, During early 1996, Poland exchanged a batch of 11 W-3 Sok√≥≈Çs with the neighbouring Czech Republic in exchange for 10 Mikoyan MiG-29. Maritime-orientated W-3RM Anaconda maritime helicopters were adopted by the Polish naval service, who used the type to perform the SAR role.Simon 2004, p. 85. Since 2003, a batch of four W-3WA helicopters were used by the Independent Air Attack Group () of the Polish forces in Iraq in support of coalition operations in the region as a part of Poland's contribution to the Iraq War. In total, eight Polish helicopters were deployed to the region until 2008. during summer 2004, the type participated in the distribution of propaganda leaflets as part of wider efforts to undermine support for Iraqi Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.Ripley 2010, p. 417. On 15 December 2004, one Sokol was lost due to an accidental crash-landing near Karbala, killing three personnel onboard and injuring three more.Glowacki, Bartosz. \\"Polish military continues expeditionary focus.\\" Flight International, 8 June 2010. Since January 2012, a force of five W-3 Sokol helicopters, along with six Mil Mi-8, have been furnished with a VIP configuration and stationed at Poland's 1st Air Transport Base following a major reshuffle of assets.Glowacki, Bartosz. \\"Poland disbands VIP transport unit.\\" Flight International, 4 January 2012.

Medical University of Silesia main building The university's first rector and one of its key founders was epidemiologist Professor Brunon Nowakowski. During the first decade of the life of the school, four towns were considered as its possible seats, namely Rokitnica, Zabrze, Bytom and Katowice. In December 1957 the Regional Council a passed decree establishing the ultimate location of the school in Katowice. In 1971 the Faculty of Pharmacy was established with majors in pharmacy, medical analytics, and environmental bioanalysis (the latter since 1978). In 1974 the Central Teaching Hospital in Katowice-Ligota started admitting patients. Also, the Nursing Faculty in Katowice-Ligota was established, which awards a master's degree in nursing (in 1990 the faculty was changed into a division of the Katowice Medical Faculty and in 2002 was included in the Faculty of Health Care and Education). In 1975 the Clinical Teaching Center was opened in Tychy, and the second Medical Faculty was established in Katowice-Ligota. In the same year the Interdepartmental Institute of Anesthesiology and Resuscitation was established (presently, Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care). In 1977 the Polish Institute of Ophthalmology was established as a Department of the Medical Faculty in Katowice. In 1996 the university was accredited by United States Department of Education and an English language division was established. The university has since obtained accreditation from all 50 states' medical boards, most recently California. The inaugural class consisted of a handful of students from the United States and the division now includes 517 students from countries in seven continents, most commonly the United States, Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. A chapter of the American Medical Students Association (AMSA) was established by the division's students in 2002. The division's Israeli students have the option of completing their final two years of study in Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon, Israel. In 1998, the Zabrze-Gliwice Medical Complex was founded. In 2002 the Faculty of Public Health and Faculty of Health Care and Education were established and the Faculty of Public Health was founded.

It educates more than 5000 undergraduate and postgraduate students in four faculties. History The Akademia Lekarska in Gda≈Ñsk was founded on 8 October 1945. Its history is related to the tradition of medical practice of surgeons associated in the Surgeons Guild (active since 1454), as well as teaching and medical and scientific research, particularly in Gda≈Ñskie Gimnazjum Akademickie (Atheneum Gedanese) established in 1558. This institution set up the Department of Science and Medicine (physices et medicinae), which was managed and supervised by eminent scholars. Among the most famous lecturers were: Joachim Oelhafius, a native of Gda≈Ñsk, who in 1613 was the first to perform a public autopsy of a newborn child in northern Europe, and Dr Jan Adam Kulmus, the author of the anatomical atlas Tabulae anatomicae, published in 1932. The work went into several editions and was translated into many languages. The Gimnazjum Akademickie represented a high standard of achievement and its graduates were accepted in the third year of medical studies at universities.Mariusz M. ≈ªYDOWO and Marek BUKOWSKI, DZIEJE NAUK MEDYCZNYCH W GDA≈ÉSKU, page 3, third paragraph After the closing of the Gimnazjum Akademickie at the beginning of the 19th century, it was not until the first years of the 20th century that another academic school was established. Pharmaceutical sciences in Gda≈Ñsk date back to the times of Johannes Placotomus, author and founder of the first pharmacy in Gda≈Ñsk in 1527, and Johannes Schmiedt, alias Fabritius, the co- author of the oldest Polish pharmacopoeia, published in 1665. MUG Hospital, Dƒôbinki Street. In 1935 the Gda≈Ñsk Senate, already represented mostly by German nationalists (members of the NSDAP) went about establishing Akademia Medycyny Praktycznej (Die Staatliche Akademie f√ºr Praktische Medizin zu Danzig) on the basis of the municipal hospital built between 1907 and 1911. Teaching medicine in the newly opened college involved clinical courses. In 1940, following the introduction of pre-clinical courses, the college‚Äôs name was changed to Medizinische Akademie in Danzig, offering full 5-year medical studies. MUG Atheneum Gedanense Novum building After the end of World War II, Akademia Lekarska was founded in Gda≈Ñsk. In 1950 its name was changed to Akademia Medyczna (The Medical University of Gda≈Ñsk). Among the professors of the newly established college, there were many eminent Polish scholars from the University of Stefan Batory in Vilnius, who had come to Gda≈Ñsk after Vilnius was incorporated into the Soviet Union, and a handful of scholars from other pre-war Polish academic centers. Initially, Akademia Lekarska conducted studies in two majors: medical and pharmaceutical. In May 1947 the Faculty of Stomatology was created and later on in January 1950 the name was changed to the Subfaculty of Dentistry at the Faculty of Medicine. In 1975 Medical University of Gda≈Ñsk (MUG) opened a branch in Bydgoszcz, which in 1984 became an independent college. In 1993, as a joint unit of Medical University of Gda≈Ñsk and Gda≈Ñsk University, the Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology was founded. In the academic year 2005/2006 Medical University started the Faculty of Health Sciences. In 2016 works began on a Non-Invasive Medicine Centre at the University, with works set to be complete by the end of 2020.Construction of Modern CMN Hospital in Gda≈Ñsk From 30th October 2019 the Medical University of Gda≈Ñsk officially holds the ministerial status of a research university. It is 1 of 10 universities in Poland and the only medical university which was awarded a place in this prestigious group. Faculties The faculties are: *Faculty of Medicine *Faculty of Pharmacy with Subfaculty of Laboratory Medicine *Faculty of Health Sciences with Subfaculty of Nursing and Institute of Maritime and Tropical Medicine *The Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology of the University of Gda≈Ñsk and the Medical University of Gda≈Ñsk. Teaching activities are carried out by nearly one thousand of academic teachers, with over one hundred of them holding the professor position. Currently, MUG offers education in nearly all medical professions and classes are also conducted in English. This programme is called English Division of the Faculty of Medicine. University rankings MUG is recognized nationally as one of the top universities in Poland and ranked internationally for clinical medicine by some of the most trusted publications. * National Ranking: In the 2020 edition of the annual University Academic Ranking published by Perspektywy, an independent non-profit educational foundation, that has been publishing rankings of Polish universities yearly since 1998, MUG is ranked 1st as a medical school and 6th as a national university (advancing 1 position from the previous year). * International Rankings: *# U.S. News & World Report: MUG is ranked 290nd for Clinical Medicine in the 2020 edition of the Best Global Universities, moving up from 292nd in 2019. *# Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities: MUG is ranked 301-400 for Clinical Medicine in the 2020 edition of Global Ranking of Academic Subjects published by ShanghaiRanking. Research Aside from the educational activity, the MUG focuses on scientific research. It is one of the only two medical universities in Poland that can boast the prestigious category of A+ for the Faculty of Pharmacy with Subfaculty of Laboratory Medicine and A for other faculties, as rated by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. In July 2012, the Faculty of Pharmacy with Subfaculty of Laboratory Medicine was designated one of Poland's 6 Leading National Research Centres (Krajowe Naukowe O≈õrodki WiodƒÖce, KNOW) by the Prime Minister's Office, as part of a wider strategy to make the country more competitive and innovative, and was granted a subsidy of 50 million Polish zlotys. MUG was named by Elsevier the 2017 winner of Polish Research Impact Leaders Award in Medical Sciences. According to Elsevier's press release, the evaluation criteria are based on a combination of bibliometric indicators collected from Elsevier‚Äôs SciVal. Indicators needed to reflect an increase in the number of publications in the most prestigious scientific journals, and showcase a high-level of international cooperation and impact, as measured by the Field-Weighted Citation Index. Universities whose authors published at least 50 publications in the period 2014-2016 in the given disciplines were considered for the award. Jagiellonian University and University of Rzeszow were the other 2 finalists for the award in this discipline. When the ranking system of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education was established, the Medical University of Gda≈Ñsk introduced an internal system of parametric assessment of particular research units. Today, three faculties of the MUG ‚Äì Medicine, Pharmacy, and the Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology have top positions in the ranking, as does the unique Interdepartmental Institute of Maritime and Tropical Medicine. The Faculty of Health Sciences, founded in 2006, is preparing for the parametric assessment of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education and it has also submitted an application to be granted the right to award PhD degrees. The main funding sources for research are: statutory activity (118 research topics), commissioned projects, development projects, own projects, promoter projects, post doctorate projects (altogether 109 projects), own research (345 research topics), and research support activity (37 projects). Moreover, the academic teachers perform scientific research under contract with external entities, primarily with pharmaceutical enterprises (19 service and research projects). The University staff also carries out projects financed by the EU framework programmes and other community initiatives, as well as structural funds, including the Sector Operational Programme ‚ÄìIncreased Enterprise Competition. The high level of research work and the highest qualifications of the university's academic teaching staff are reflected in individual distinctions, among many ‚Äì the Polish equivalence of Nobel Prizes ‚Äì the prize awarded by the Foundation for Polish Science to professors: Roman Kaliszan in 2003, Janusz Limon in 2004, and Piotr Trzonkowski in 2017. In 2006, the Prime Minister gave the award for scientific activity to Professor Jacek Jassem, who is also a recipient of various other accolades over the years. In another instance, post doctorate teacher Micha≈Ç Markuszewski was the laureate of the prestigious academic scholarship of the Minister of Science and Higher Education; the scholarship was granted to eminent young scientists in the category of research for the sake of scientific development. The Ministry of Science and Higher Education ranked both the MUG‚Äôs Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Health Sciences with an 'A' grade, and the Faculty of Pharmacy and Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology UG & MUG with grades A+. Developments The Invasive Medicine Centre was built in 2011, funded by the Polish government (480 million PLN). It is the largest healthcare investment in the Pomorskie region in the last 30 years. This new hospital building consists of several parts which house 12 surgical wards. The Centre‚Äôs maximum bedspace is 311 patients. Its roof functions as a helicopter landing pad, which is connected with the Emergency Department via two elevators. Many new research institutes and clinics have been established, the equipment has been modernized, new facilities have been created and all the buildings including the campus have been equipped with computers and a computer network. In 2007 the modernization of the main teaching hospital, Academic Clinical Centre was launched. The investment is co-financed by the state budget with the subsidy of 480 million Polish zlotys. Construction of the new Non-Invasive Medical Center with about 75,000 m2, at an estimated cost of 600 million Polish zlotys, commenced in 2015 and is scheduled to complete in 2020. When finished, the building will consist of 4 connected buildings that could house up to 687 beds (excluding bed space at day wards and the post-anesthesia unit). International links The university cooperates with more than 50 universities and scientific centers abroad. It exchanges students and teachers in the framework of the Lifelong Learning Programme and is an active member of many European organizations and institutions. It is a founding member of two regional organizations: ScanBalt and the Baltic Sea Region University Network. Clinical mission Aside from fulfilling its teaching and research roles, the Medical University is the founding body of four health care institutes, including two clinical hospitals: the University Clinical Centre ‚Äì the MUG Hospital and the Institute of Maritime and Tropical Medicine. Their significance for the health care system is shown in the number of hospitalized patients (almost 60,000), outpatient visits (over 250,000), surgery procedures (over 21,000, including about 1,500 open-heart surgeries) and laboratory tests (over 2 million a year). The clinical hospitals offer medical treatments unavailable anywhere else in Northern Poland, such as: organ transplants (kidneys, bone marrow and heart), radiotherapy and oncological chemotherapy, child and adult hematology, invasive cardiology and electro-cardiology, organ surgery, hyperbaric medicine, tropical and nuclear medicine. The Medical University of Gda≈Ñsk and its hospitals operate locally, as well as outside the region. As a result, they cater for the health and security of around 3.5 million Poles. Cooperation The Medical University of Gda≈Ñsk provides health care for the people of Pomerania and inhabitants of neighboring regions, as the founder of clinical hospitals and other health-care facilities. It undertakes expert work for the public authorities, for example in the Health for Pomerania Programme, which aims at health improvement for the inhabitants of the region. The university is actively involved in work on the Strategy of Pomeranian Voivodship Development, Regional Innovation Strategy and the Pomeranian Voivodship Regional Operational Programme. The university's initiatives for the community spread awareness of preventive treatment and a healthy lifestyle, e.g. Good Health Picnic (Piknik na Zdrowie) and the local implementation of large-scale prophylaxis programmes, e.g. The 400 Cities Programme. The University actively participates in the Baltic Science Festival.

Blades are a specialized type of lithic flake that are at least twice as long as they are wide. An alternate method of defining blades focuses on production features, including parallel lateral edges and dorsal scars, a lack of cortex, a prepared platform with a broad angle, and a proximal bulb of percussion. Microblades are generally less than 50 mm long in their finished state. Here is an example of two microblades and a microblade core. History The geographic origin of microblades is poorly understood, with differing theories posing origins in Southern Siberia, Northern China, or the PHSK (Paleo-Hokkaido-Sakhalin-Kurile) peninsula, with dates ranging from over 30,000 BP to as little as 18,000 BP. Because microblade technology is economical (using less raw material than other technologies), relatively easy to make, and extremely portable, it came into widespread use over vast parts of northern Asia and northeastern Siberia during and after the Ice Age. Microblade technology was very efficient for hunting because it used light, barbed spears. During the Ice Age, hunter- gatherers suffered from shortage of food resources, so they had to move more frequently. Microblade is suitable for high mobility and rapid weapon production, as well as reducing failure of hunting and lost or damaged weapons. In other words, in the resource-limited environment of the LGM, hunter-gatherers invested more time acquiring better raw materials and developing the technique of lithic manufacture. Barbed tips opened wounds and the resulting blood loss killed prey faster and with less loss of hunting equipment than traditional spears. These changes in lithic technology appear to have been adaptations to reduced resource availability due to climate changes during the Last Glacial Maximum and Younger Dryas allowing for more efficient sustenance strategies. An important site for learning more about the diverse adaptations of the microblade is Shuidonggou Locality 12 (SDG12). It was at this site that microblades were found along with diverse artifacts: needles, awls, and a bone knife handle. This handle is a big indicator that microblades were used for multiple purposes, and no longer were exclusive to hunting. In at least one site in Northern China, microblades are also found in context with heat shattered and burned stone, usually evidence for stone- boiling practices, another resource intensification strategy aimed at recovering more nutrients from food resources via cooking. The first Native Americans brought this technology with them across the Bering Land Bridge to North America. At least six independent Native American groups used microblade technology, including the Poverty Point/Jaketown, Hopewell culture, Tikal Maya, and Northwest Coast peoples. Specialized craftspeople manufactured millions of microblades in the Mississippian chiefdom of Cahokia, in Illinois, as did Chumash (tribe) craftspeople in California's Northern Channel Islands. In both of these cases, microblades were sharpened to a point and attached to the end of sticks, creating microdrills. These microdrills were used to drill holes in marine shells to create beads. Shell beads were used as money among the Chumash, and as a result microblades were a vital part of the Chumash economy.

Users primarily deployed this tool to provide detailed technical information about the user's software and hardware and to print the gathered information, usually for use by support technicians in troubleshooting and resolving problems. The assumptions made by the program were valid until the late 1990s: it does not handle plug-and-play USB or other new technologies that appeared around 2000. In PC DOS 6.1 and above, \`QCONFIG.EXE\` provides similar functionality. Commercial alternatives include Manifest \`MFT.EXE\` from Quarterdeck's QEMM.  History  \`MSD\` first shipped with Microsoft Word for Windows, and was later included in Windows 3, MS-DOS 6, and on the Windows 9x CD-ROMs. Because OS/2 and Windows NT contain code forked from DOS at the DOS 5 level, the versions of \`MSD\` included here correspond to that of that era (i.e. version 2.0). Windows NT 3 and NT 4 have \`WINMSD\`, a program with similar features. However, the DOS/Windows specific functions were replaced by similar Windows NT concerns. \`WINMSDP.EXE\`, included in the resource kits, provides the print functionality of \`MSD\` for \`WINMSD\`. Since NT 5 (Windows 2000), \`WINMSD.EXE\` has been a loader for \`MSINFO32.EXE\`.  Usage  Users generally started the program from the DOS Command Prompt using the command \`MSD.EXE\`.

Beyond that, it is also known to other characters of the DC Universe as both a port city and a haven for artists in many of the media, from print to audio/visual to music. Green Arrow's base of operation was initially New York City. However, during the Silver Age, Green Arrow's home was established as being in Star City, being first mentioned in Adventure Comics vol. 1 #265,Adventure Comics vol. 1 #265 (October 1959) before making its first appearance in the following issue.Adventure Comics vol. 1 #266 (November 1959) The city has also been called Starling City (Arrow episode). Established history in the comics According to several published accounts, Star City was incorporated as a city under its current name over 200 years ago. Before moving on to service in first Metropolis and later Gotham City, Maggie Sawyer began her career as a police officer in Star City. The first costumed vigilante to serve as mayor was Thomas \\"Steelclaw\\" Bolt, who adopted an undercover persona as a costumed criminal as part of his efforts to bring local crime under control. He died in office of that attempt. During the years that Green Arrow spent outside of Star City, at least one other costumed crime-fighter operated there: Chase Lawler, one of the several known Manhunters.Manhunter (vol. 2) #0-12 (October 1994-November 1995) The final Green Arrow storyline before One Year Later featured Doctor Light and Merlyn detonating explosives, leaving nearly a third of Star City in shambles in what becomes known as the \\"Amsterdam Avenue Disaster\\". In the One Year Later storyline, Oliver Queen becomes the mayor of Star City.Green Arrow (vol. 3) #60 (May 2006) News that he had been secretly funding the Outsiders, essentially a bounty hunter team at this point in their history, causes a scandal. Coupled with his marginal popularity with the voting public (he never had more than 50% of the city supporting him while in office), this prompted Queen to resign his position. His resignation carried the stipulation that his successor maintain the various social aid organisations and resources Queen had established. Ollie was able to beat his opponent by resigning prior to the election and putting someone he trusted in charge of the city.Green Arrow (vol. 3) #75 (August 2007) In Justice League: Cry for Justice mini-series, Star City is the scene of a devastating tremor set by Prometheus.Justice League: Cry for Justice #6 (March 2010) Prometheus' plan is to teleport Star City‚Äîwhich he has targeted solely because it is the home city of a member of the Justice League‚Äîto an alternate universe. As the plan fails, Star City's outskirts are left mostly intact but there is a vast, star-shaped ruin in the centre of the city, and a death toll of ninety-thousand people and rising.Justice League: Cry for Justice #7 (April 2010) During the events of Brightest Day, Deadman's white power ring teleports him to the site of the tremor, where his newly acquired White Lantern's powers turn the ruin into a lush forest.Brightest Day #0 (April 2010) Shortly after this event, Martian Manhunter is informed by the Entity that he has been resurrected in order to burn the forest to the ground.Brightest Day #7 (August 2010) Martian Manhunter arrives in the Star City forest and attempts to complete his task, however he is stopped from doing that by the Entity who revealed to him that the forest he is to burn down is on Mars.Brightest Day #9 (September 2010) Green Arrow discovers that the forest appears to have some sentient intelligence or some kind of powers of illusion with instructs to protect or kill someone.Green Arrow (vol. 4) #3 (August 2010) The Entity later reveals that Nekron's attack at the Entity not only was mortally to it but also heightened the contamination of the planet, and the corruption will rise up in the form of another \\"dark avatar\\" of the darkness who will try to destroy the Star City forest, in which is the key to save Earth's soul and the new champion of life, causing the Earth to die.Brightest Day #19 (February 2011) Green Arrow later discovers that the forest is not what appeared to be and that the heart of the forest is evil.Green Arrow (vol. 4) #10 (March 2011) This evil eventually became the \\"Dark Avatar\\" which the Entity mentioned would come to destroy the forest. This Dark Avatar is actually the original Swamp Thing resurrected as a Black Lantern. Also as the entire Earth falls victim of its poisoning and corruption it is revealed that the only place that is not yet touched is the forest where the sky is still blue, however as the population began to take shelter they are stopped by a white barrier. To defend the forest from the Dark Avatar, the Entity summoned the Elementals, which are revealed to be the heroes whose life force had been collected by the Entity and which reflect the simplest essential parts and principles of nature, each one representing one of the four elements, the Entity also reveals that the central tree in the Star City forest is the foundation for the Parliament of Trees.Brightest Day #22 (March 2011) The Elementals are fused with the body of Alec Holland to resurrect him and then the forest fused Alec Holland to transform him into the new Swamp Thing. After the Dark Avatar is finally defeated, Alec Holland reclaims the title of Swamp Thing and begins to restore life in Star City's areas.Brightest Day #24 (April 2011) Locations through the decades Star City's location, like those of Metropolis, Gotham City, and other cities in the DC Universe, was uncertain for many years, with varying depictions over the decades. Several golden age stories depicted Green Arrow and Speedy fighting seafaring villains -- the Angler, the Harbor Thief, and the Turtle, among others‚Äîimplying the city was on a sea coast. Long before Green Arrow joined the Justice League of America, he and Speedy often teamed up with underwater adventurer Aquaman (whose adventures, like those of the two archers, appeared in Adventure Comics), supporting the notion that Star City was a coastal city. Star City's location was given as near the Great Lakes in the 1960s and near Massachusetts Bay from the 1970s until the late 1980s. In one 1970s reference, it was stated that Star City was in Connecticut.Bob Rozakis, \\"Ask the Answer Man,\\" Daily Planet, Detective Comics #470 (June 1977) A map published in 1985 and occasionally modified by Mayfair Games detailed Star City's geographical layout. Though the Atlas placed Star City on California's Pacific Coast, north of San Francisco, the layout used for the city map resembled the geography of metropolitan Chicago, but reversed, so that it would be on the Michigan side of Lake Michigan. The neighborhood of \\"East Gary\\" was approximately where the real Gary, Indiana, would be on the reversed map, but on the Pacific Ocean instead of Lake Michigan. In November 1985's publication DC Comics Presents #87, Superman is flying above Earth- Prime (our reality Earth without superheroes) when he notices that Star City has been replaced with the city of Boston, Massachusetts. In Birds of Prey #119, Star City is depicted as being in the San Francisco Bay region, although the published map erroneously substitutes Star City for San Francisco. Also, the city of Platinum Flats (based on Silicon Valley), is described as \\"half an hour\\" away. In the TV show Arrow, Star City is generally described as being on the West Coast, or Western Seaboard, and in dialogue is described as 600 miles from Central City. A season five episode gives the city a Washington state postal code. Near the end of season 5 episode 22, a computer generated map showing the flight path of Chase's plane puts Star City on or near San Francisco as the coastline perfectly matches that of northern California. Season 7 episode 15 has Felicity giving coordinates (which turn out to be for the Glades) of 47.119N, 122.3301W, which actually maps to the south suburbs of Tacoma, WA (about 40 miles south of Seattle). However, in season 3 episode 9, another flight map shown briefly onscreen locates Starling City (changed during the show) in the Great Lakes region. The DC Rebirth Green Arrow series specifically states Star City as actually being Seattle, only later being renamed Star City. Established city characteristics =Landmarks= Among the more notable landmarks established by various Green Arrow creative teams include the following: ;Star Bridge:This suspension bridge is one of city's primary visual landmarks, known for a giant star sculpture atop each tower in the span of the bridge, connecting Star City's various regions. ;The Grell Museum:Named after Mike Grell, who wrote and drew a definitive era of Green Arrow in the 1980s ;Papp Stadium: Named after George Papp, one of Green Arrow's original co-creators from the 1940s, this is the home of the Star City Rockets baseball team =Neighborhoods= Known neighborhoods include: ;The \\"Triangle\\": Long fought over by the city's various organized crime factions until the intervention of the freelance criminal Deadshot as depicted in his second mini-series. ;Lamb Valley: Detailed in the pages of the Green Arrow collected edition Straight Shooter. ;The South End: Introduced in Green Arrow v.3 # 60, in the wake of the events of Infinite Crisis and 52. ;The Glades: Named in Green Arrow v.3 # 61. One of the districts directly abutting the South End. ;Orchid Bay: The downtown section, and site of City Hall. Named in Green Arrow v.3 # 63. ;Adams Heights: Named in Green Arrow v.3 # 67. Possibly named in honor of artist Neal Adams, long associated with Green Arrow. Statistics Star City's population is given in Green Arrow (\\"City Walls\\" Pt.3) as being roughly five million.Green Arrow (Collections) (vol. 3) #5 (April 2005) The population is given as just under 600,000 in the CW series Arrow. In the third season episode ‚ÄúGuilty‚Äù, Felicity mentions there being ‚Äúroughy 86,000 ‚ÄòPaco‚Äôs‚Äô, give or take a few nick names\\". This estimates the total population being almost 15% named ‚ÄúPaco‚Äù. Sports teams The fictional Star City Rockets play baseball in Papp Stadium, while the fictional Star City Thunder play basketball in Tinder-Smith Garden. In other media =Live- action television= Smallville Star City was briefly mentioned by Lex Luthor in the Smallville sixth-season episode \\"Reunion\\". In \\"Freak\\", Tobias Rice‚Äîa meteor freak whose exposure to kryptonite rendered him blind while allowing him to \\"see\\" other people infected by meteor rocks‚Äîis sent to Star City because Oliver Queen said he would be given a cornea transplant. A computer generated panorama of Star City can also be seen in the first episode in the online Smallville spinoff short The Oliver Queen Chronicles. In the Smallville eighth-season episode \\"Bride\\", Jimmy Olsen was sent to Star City for medical attention after being critically injured by Doomsday. In the season 10 episode \\"Fortune\\", Chloe tells Clark that she is moving to Star City, where she will work by day as a reporter for the Star City Register and nurture new superheroes by night. Star City was also briefly mentioned in the sixth-season episode \\"Justice\\" when Oliver Queen was talking to Clark about being on patrol in Star City when he came across Bart Allen, aka \\"The Flash\\".  Arrowverse  In Arrow, Star City is originally named \\"Starling City\\" but is renamed in the fourth season as part of the storyline. In the first- season episode \\"Unfinished Business\\", the coordinates (47.6097N 122.3331W) place a rundown neighborhood of Starling City in Seattle, near the Pioneer Square-Skid Road Historic District known for the Seattle Underground. This was built after the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 and forgotten decades later, much like the subway system abandoned in Starling City. In the second season episode \\"Blast Radius\\", a Starling City ZIP code is shown as 98114. 981xx is the main ZIP Code for Seattle. However, in the episode \\"The Climb\\" Starling is shown on a map to be in the Upper Midwest. In the pilot episode of The Flash Oliver Queen states Starling is 600 miles away from Central City, which could be in Missouri (although Central City is traditionally placed at Athens, Ohio). In \\"Schism\\", the final episode of the fourth season, an on-screen graphic shows a map of the Midwest with Star City in place of Chicago. Near the end of season five episode \\"Missing\\", a computer generated map showing the flight path of Adrian Chase's plane puts Star City on or near San Francisco as the coastline perfectly matches that of northern California. Multiple cities are used for establishing shots, including Vancouver, Baltimore, Boston, Brussels,Quand la s√©rie Arrow nous montre... Bruxelles ! on RTBF TV, consulted on September 8, 2013. Frankfurt, Jersey City, Philadelphia, and Tokyo. Reference is made to an area in Starling City known as the Glades where the criminal element is particularly predominant, similar to the Narrows and Crime Alley in Gotham City. Starling City has also been said to have a baseball team known as the \\"Starling Rockets\\" and a \\"Starling Comets\\" football team has been seen. Starling City has an aquarium and zoo, both of which were used for minor plot points, the aquarium being used by a Vertigo junkie as a place to hold hostages and the zoo's Tibetan pit vipers were used for their venom by Nyssa al Ghul. Starling City also at one point had a functioning subway system but no longer does. After the city is attacked at the end of the second season by Slade Wilson's mirakuru-enhanced army, in the third season scientist and businessman Ray Palmer proposes to rename the city \\"Star City\\" to keep people from remembering the terrorist attacks. It is later renamed Star City in season four as a memorial to Palmer due to his apparent death in the season three finale. In season four, Queen is appointed the mayor of Star City. In the sixth season episode \\"Thanksgiving\\", Star City is shown to have its own stadium, \\"Starling Stadium\\", where musicians like Billy Joel perform. In season seven's 2040 flashforwards, the Glades has developed into its own thriving city, separated from the poorer Star City with a wall. The wall is destroyed by the Star City vigilantes in the season seven finale. * Starling City of Earth-2 is mentioned in The Flash's season two episode \\"Enter Zoom\\" and Arrow's season five episode \\"Who Are You?\\". In 2015, the Starling City vigilante known as the Arrow was revealed to be Robert Queen. In Arrow's season eight premiere, Oliver travels to the Earth-2 Starling City, where Adrian Chase is now operating as the Hood. The city and the entire Earth-2 is destroyed by an anti-matter wave at the end of the episode. * Star City of Earth-38 is mentioned by Rhea as a future target for a Daxamite attack in Supergirl season two episode \\"Nevertheless, She Persisted\\". * Star City of Earth-X appears in The Flash season four episode \\"Crisis on Earth-X, Part 3\\" and Freedom Fighters: The Ray season one \\"Episode Six\\". Wishing to fight back against the oppressive New Reich, the Freedom Fighters set up a base of operations in a bunker in Star City. A number of Earth One heroes were brought here by Freedom Fighters Ray Terrill and Leo Snart. =Animation= Star City has also been the setting of several Green Arrow stories on animated series like The Batman, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, DC Showcase: Green Arrow, and Young Justice. Despite not physically appearing in the show, Star City has been mentioned in Beware The Batman.

Over her short film career she reportedly appeared in more than three hundred motion pictures, a large number of which would have been short films. She made her last film in 1919. Hawley was married to Charles Fulcher, with whom she operated a farm near Camden, New York, for the last 15 years of her life. She also painted portraits and wrote stories for children. She died in a hospital in Rome, New York, on June 3, 1942.

It is situated immediately behind the beach codenamed Juno, the section of the Allied beachhead on which 14,000 Canadian troops landed on D-Day 6 June 1944. The Centre was conceived in the 1990s by a group of Canadian veterans who felt that the contributions and sacrifices of Canadian soldiers during the liberation of Europe were not properly commemorated and represented in the Normandy region. The project, spearheaded by veteran Garth Webb and his companion Lise Cooper, began initially as a grassroots fundraising campaign that eventually gained the financial support of many institutions and businesses and the Canadian and French governments at many levels. The Centre was inaugurated on 6 June 2003. Over one thousand Canadian veterans attended the inauguration in 2003, as well as the 2004 ceremony for the 60th anniversary of D-Day. The museum's scope is not only the D-Day landings. Through detailed and interactive exhibition rooms, the museum relates the story of life in Canada before the outbreak of the war, Canada's civilian and military contribution to the war effort, and contemporary Canadian society in the decades since World War II. The building itself, designed by Canadian architect Brian K. Chamberlain, is a single- storey structure with five main points, resembling a stylized maple leaf. The exterior is clad in titanium scales and stands about 100 meters back from the present line of sand dunes. A ceremonial area, which features a statue entitled Remembrance and Renewal, stands between the Centre and the dunes. A gap in the dunes is filled by a symbolic structure shaped as a landing craft‚Äîa memorial to the French Resistance. An intact German bunker, once an observation post, stands immediately in front of this memorial. The museum also houses a temporary exhibition space which changes approximately once per year and which highlights histories and themes relating to Canada past and present. The Juno Beach Centre is open year-round and closes routinely for the month of January. It offers guided visits of Juno Beach that are provided by Canadian students. The most recent visit by a Canadian Prime Minister was on 6 June 2019 by Justin Trudeau as part of the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings.CTV News story References External links * Category:World War II museums in France Category:Museums in Calvados (department) Category:Operation Overlord museums in France Category:History of Canada ","title":"Juno Beach Centre"},{"id":"2613793","text":"Inverkip (Scottish Gaelic: Inbhir Chip) is a village and parish in the Inverclyde council area and historic county of Renfrewshire in the west central Lowlands of Scotland, southwest of Greenock and north of Largs on the A78 trunk road. The village takes its name from the River Kip. It is served by Inverkip railway station. History =Origins= In the year 1170, Baldwin de Bigres, the Sheriff of Lanark, granted a stretch of land to the monks of Paisley Abbey. This land was described as \\"The pennyland between the rivulets Kip and Daff\\". Pennyland is an old Scots word of Norse origin which is used to describe a small piece of land, the rent for which is one penny per year. The area granted to the monks in 1170 equates to much of the north section of today's village, from the bridge over the Daff on Main Street, near Inverkip Hotel to the old bridge over the Kip at Bridgend Cottages. Extending to the coast at the old bridge at Kip Marina and probably as far inland as the railway line. Inverkip was made a burgh of barony before the Act of Union in 1707, with the parish containing all of Gourock, Wemyss Bay, Skelmorlie and part of Greenock. =Inverkip Church= Inverkip Parish Church By 1188, the monks had built a church on the site of the present old graveyard, at what is now the junction of Langhouse Road and Millhouse Road. This small church (known as Auld Kirk) served the entire Christian population between Kilmacolm and Largs for around 400 years. The existing (derelict) mausoleum of the Shaw- Stewarts stands on the site of the original church and incorporates some of its structure. The Christians of Greenock presented a petition to the Crown for a Church of their own. This resulted in the opening of the Old West Kirk in Greenock in 1859 and brought to an end the regular six mile each way treks by Sunday worshipers from Greenock to Inverkip. A journey which must have been very demanding, given the terrain and the absence of proper roads during that period. The present church building on Langhouse Road was completed in 1805, reputedly to a plan by the civil engineer Thomas Telford, but there is no evidence to support this and the design of Inverkip Church is quite different from the known 'Telford Kirks' which were built during the same period. The church building is described by Historic Environment Scotland as \\"2-storey type; simple Renaissance with upper windows round-headed; open belfry at front gable; (1804-5). Clock on pediment several of windows blocked up, but fenestration pattern kept in black & white\\". The church hall and manse were built during the 1960s and stand across Langhouse Road from the church itself. The old manse (now known as Kirkbrae house) is also on Langhouse Road, between the original and present churches. It was built in 1730 and is now a private residence. =Ardgowan= Ardgowan House with the Firth of Clyde beyond. Viewed from Bargane Hill. By the 13th century, a castle had been built at what is now Ardgowan House. This early castle changed hands between the Scots and the English during the Wars of Independence. Robert The Bruce fought here for both sides during this period. The land was acquired by the Stewarts in 1390 and they built the existing castle during the 15th century. Contained in the gardens of Ardgowan House and away from the public eye, it consists of a three-storey square keep with a garret. The main entrance is at first floor level and is accessed by an external stairway. The castle was abandoned as a residence when Ardgowan House was built by the Shaw-Stewarts in 1799‚Äì1801. Following construction of Ardgowan House, the first proper road to Greenock was constructed by Sir John Shaw Stewart and opened in 1803. Ardgowan House served as a military hospital during both world wars and has the distinction of being the first Scottish military hospital to be damaged by German bombs. The damage was slight and no casualties were recorded, but many windows at the house were smashed. =Witchcraft & Witch Hunts= Inverkip was a hotbed of witchcraft activity for half a century from 1640 to 1690. The Ministers of the parish at the time, the Rev John Hamilton (1626 to 1664) and Rev Alexander Leslie (1665 to 1684) were noted as being ‚Äòzealous persecutors of witches‚Äô. A Royal Enquiry into the Inverkip witch hunts, which have been compared to those at Salem, was led by Archibald Stewart of Blackhall. During this enquiry 18 year old Marie Lamont was tried as a witch before the Commission, Sir Archibald and the Rev John Hamilton. Marie confessed that ‚ÄòJean King, Kattie Scott, Janet Holm, herself and sundry others, met together in the mirk, at the bucht-gait of Ardgowan whar, the devil was with them in the shape of a black man with cloven feet, and directit them to fetch whyte sand fre the shore, and cast it about yetts of Ardgowan and about the ministers hous‚Äô. Marie was found guilty of witchcraft and burned at the stake, the fate of the others is not known. A local verse recalls another notable character during this period... \\"In Auld Kirk the witches ride thick And in Dunrod they dwell; But the greatest loon amang them a' Is Auld Dunrod himsel'.\\" 'Auld Dunrod' was the last of the Lindsay family of Dunrod Castle. As the result of a dissolute life he lost all his possessions and fell into the black arts. Local reputation had it that he was in league with the devil, and he died in mysterious circumstances in a barn belonging to one of his former tenant farmers. Nothing now remains of the castle which stood at the foot of Dunrod Hill. =Shaws Water Scheme= A valve house on the Cut, with Inverkip beyond. Commissioned by Sir Michael Shaw Stewart, 5th Baronet and designed by industrialist Robert Thom of Rothesay, this grand water supply scheme in the hills behind the village was completed in 1827. It entailed the damming of Shaws Water (a small stream on the other side of the hills from Greenock) to create what is now known as Loch Thom. The Greenock Cut was also created to supply water from the loch, around the hills, to the town of Greenock for domestic and industrial purposes. The scheme was still in use as recently as 1971, at which time it was made obsolete by the boring of a tunnel through Whinhill. =Cholera Outbreak= 1849 was a disastrous year for the village; not only did the crops fail, but one third of the population died due to an outbreak of cholera. =Smuggling= During the late 18th century and early 19th century, the village was noted for smuggling activities involving the illicit transfer of alcohol, tea and tobacco from vessels heading up the Firth of Clyde to the ports of Greenock and Port Glasgow. One well known case is that of Thomas Finnie, a local milkman, whose tale is recorded in the records of the Innerkip Society: ‚ÄúEarly in the morning of the 22nd of December, 1809, about 6 am, Thomas Spence, Supervisor of Excise in Greenock, could have been seen ‚Äì suitably armed with pistol, etc ‚Äì riding through the slush to Inverkip accompanied by two other officers. Almost exhausted and perished with the cold after their unusual errand they espied Thomas Finnie‚Äôs milk cart. They lay in wait near the Daff burn and when Thomas had reached that point on his way to the ‚Äúbig house‚Äù with his morning delivery, the command to halt came from Spence. Mr Spence immediately searched the cart and in addition to the usual and necessary commodity of milk, he found three casks of Highland whisky containing in all 30 gallons. The horse, cart, milk and whisky and, of course, Thomas, were seized and taken in charge when, suddenly, Spence spotted Robert Cochrane some distance off. Cochrane was also searched and his cart was found to contain 50 gallons of Whisky. Both carts, their contents and their owners were marched on to Greenock Bridewell.‚Äù =The Railway= Inverkip Railway Station 1865 saw the opening of the Port Glasgow to Wemyss Bay line by the Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway Company, with the trains being operated by the Caledonian Railway Company. A station was opened at Inverkip in 1867 and this resulted in the transformation of Inverkip from a rural agricultural village community to being more of a seaside resort busy with railway trippers from Greenock and Glasgow. A jetty near the present day War Memorial served ferry boats which tendered to the passing Paddle Steamers. The railway line was electrified in 1967 and has been served by EMUs (Electric Multiple Units) of various classes since then. The line was made single track at this time, which resulted in Inverkip station being reduced to a single platform and losing its bridges across the line. A new footbridge across the line was opened in 2014, with a lift to provide wheelchair access as there was insufficient space for ramp access on the downhill side. =Energy Supplies= By 1900 a gas supply was piped to the village from Bankfoot, which was the home farm of Ardgowan Estate and which is located around a mile outside the village on the road to Greenock. The 1913 OS 25 inch map shows a gasometer at the farm Electricity arrived in the village in 1932, supplied from the Hydro scheme in nearby Skelmorlie. =World War II= Tank Traps, Ardgowan Point The mouth of Kip Water was excavated in 1940 by the Army Royal Engineers Unit to enable the storage of barges. After the war, this excavated area became a popular bathing and boating area with locals and day- trippers alike. Two large concrete blocks on the beach nearby are probably tank traps, a relic of this time. Kip Marina now stands on the site of the WWII excavation. The army built and occupied 28 houses in Daff Avenue at this time. These houses survive today and can be seen just off Main Street at Langhouse Road. =Housing= Glebe Road houses From 1951-1957 Renfrewshire County Council built the Crawford Lane and Glebe Road housing scheme. This development lies on the high ground at Langhouse Road, behind the present church building. This provided much needed affordable, good quality housing to local people in the immediate post-WWII years. Since the 1980s the village has seen many large private housing developments completed, including off Langhouse Road, Swallow Brae, Kip Marina and several at the 'Hill Farm' site off Finnockbog Road. Further housing developments are planned at the former power station site. The village now serves largely as a dormitory to Greenock and the major towns beyond. =Road Transport= The A78 Inverkip Bypass The village stands on the A78 coast road which runs from Greenock to Monkton, near Prestwick Airport. Main Street was the A78 road until the bypass opened in the early 1970s. The single carriageway bypass road was designed with wide margins to provide long sight lines and to enable future construction of a dual carriageway if traffic demanded it. Evidence of this can be seen at the flyover at the power station access road, which is dual carriageway, with just one side being used. Despite the bypass, Main Street is still congested due to the presence of many parked cars. =Inverkip Power Station (demolished)= Inverkip Power Station This was an oil-fired power station which was constructed during the 1970s and demolished between 2010 and 2015. Due to the increase in oil prices as a result of the 1973 Oil Crisis, the station was never used commercially to full capacity (except during the UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì85)). Power generation stopped in 1988 and the station was kept in reserve before being mothballed in the late 1990s. It was decommissioned in 2006. at which time some of the equipment was sold and transferred to other power stations around the country. The chimney was the tallest free standing structure in Scotland and the third tallest in the UK when it was built in 1976https://c20society.org.uk/building-of-the- month/inverkip-power-station-firth-of-clyde. =Population= Since its origins, the village population has grown from around 200 to around 3300 (2016 projection). The population of the village has doubled since the 1980s housing boom. =Murder of Margaret Fleming = \\"Seacroft\\", Inverkip, from the A78 In 2019 Avril Jones and Edward Cairney of Inverkip were convicted of the murder of Margaret Fleming, for whom they were nominated carers. Their bungalow, \\"Seacroft\\", stands on the coast, beside the A78 road about to the south of the village. Fleming was killed between December 1999 and January 2000, but they concealed her death and Jones continued to claim benefits due to Fleming until it was discovered, in 2016, that Fleming was missing. In 2017 the property was sold, with the house to be demolished. . The house was demolished in early March 2020. The police investigation and subsequent murder trial were the subject of the BBC two-part documentary Murder Trial: The Disappearance of Margaret Fleming, broadcast in January 2020. In the same month, planning permission was given to build two new houses on the site. Places of interest =Kip Marina= Kip Marina Today Inverkip is most notable for Kip Marina, which was the first marina in Scotland and one of only three in the UK when it opened in 1971. Located at the mouth of Kip Water in an area that was excavated for use as barge storage during WWII, the marina has grown steadily over the years and now has over 600 berths and associated marine services such as a chandlery, sales and repair services. The Chartroom bar & restaurant at the marina caters not only for sailors, but also the wider community, including the adjacent Kip Marina Village which is a housing estate which was established in the 2000s. The marina hosts the annual Scotland's Boat Show each October. =Greenock Cut Visitor Centre= Greenock Cut Visitor Centre The Centre (formerly known as Cornalees Bridge Visitor Centre) is around three miles (5 km) east of Inverkip on the Loch Thom road at Cornalees Bridge. It lies within Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park and has a ranger service. The centre includes a display which describes the history of the cut. There is also a small selection of snacks and souvenirs on offer. A 7-mile (11.25 km) circular walk from the visitor centre offers views of Loch Thom and the surrounding reservoirs as well as stunning views of the Firth of Clyde and the south Highlands. This walk is virtually traffic-free and is suitable for mountianbikes. The adjacent Ardgowan Fishery offers freshwater fishing for anglers of all abilities at all times of the year. =Lunderston Bay= Lunderston Bay Beach Also part of the regional park is Lunderston Bay, a popular picnic spot on the Firth of Clyde which has a ranger service and toilet facilities. The bay is popular with bird watchers, hikers, cyclists and dog walkers. During the summer months it is a popular place for picnics and sea bathing. A coastal path (part of the National Cycle Network, Route 75) runs south from the bay to Inverkip, via Ardgowan Estate and Kip Marina. Seals and several species of bird can be seen from the path all year round. A pod of Orcas (Killer Whales) was spotted here in early 2018. Cardwell Garden Centre at the bay is a very popular visitor attraction, offering a wide range of plants plus home & garden related equipment & tools, as well as a large restaurant. =Inverkip AAOR= Inverkip AAOR, 2006 At the top of Langhouse Road a building reminiscent of the Cold War can be found in Square Wood. Known locally as 'the radar station', formally known as Inverkip Anti- Aircraft Operations Room (AAOR), the building (which is mostly underground) served \\"3 Group 77 Brigade, the Clyde Anchorage gun defended area (GDA)\\". The site was the original base of HMS Dalriada which operated there from 1965 to 1982. Conversion to residential use commenced in early 2011, but by August 2017 little visible progress had been made outside, and the inside was several feet deep with water. =Inverkip Primary School= Inverkip Primary School The village primary school is located on Station Road, in the heart of the old village. It has around 290 pupils (including a pre-5 nursery) with capacity for 320. The original 1836 two roomed school building still exists and is in daily use. Three extensions have been added since the mid 20th century. =Inverkip Community Hub= Inverkip Community Hub A small community Centre named 'Inverkip Community Hub' was opened in the village in early 2017. It is located at Kip Park, by the A78 Main Road at the north end of the village, between Bridgend and the village proper. It was built on the site of the grass football pitch. The centre includes a public library, meeting rooms, a main hall which can serve as a theatre and kitchen and catering facilities for up to 100 people. There is also a floodlit all weather sports pitch at the hub. This is the first public community centre in the village. The previous private community centre was demolished to make way for the Kip Park retail development. =Old Church Graveyard= Shaw-Stewart Mausoleum The old section of the graveyard on Millhouse Road at Langhouse Road contains the tomb of the chemist Dr. James \\"Paraffin\\" Young who was nicknamed 'Paraffin' because of his pioneering work in oil technology. He lived at the nearby Kelly Estate (above Wemyss Bay). The graveyard also contains the derelict mausoleum of the Shaw Stewart baronets of Ardgowan. It was last used in the 1970s and is in a poor state of repair. The mausoleum stands on the site of the original 1188 church (known as Auld Kirk) and incorporates parts of the original church. =Inverkip War Memorial= Inverkip War Memorial The white granite simple obelisk memorial was erected by the people of the village in 1920 to commemorate the young local men who died in the First World War. The memorial was updated to add the names of local men who died in the Second World War. It is located at the west end of the village, beside the A78 Greenock to Largs road in what is now a small area of parkland and lay-by which was created when the road was re-aligned in the early 1970s. A WWI centenary memorial bench was added nearby around 2015.

A sub post office is located within the pharmacy in what was (until 2010) the general store on Main Street. Kip Park is a retail and business block, located at the north end of Main Street. Businesses operating there include a bistro, fish & chip shop, supermarket, hairdresser and a nursery. Across the A78 road at Kip Marina, several yachting related businesses can be found in addition to the marina itself. A bar/restaurant, cafe and gallery are also located there. =Accommodation= Inverkip Hotel Inverkip Hotel is a traditional Scottish village hotel, with a bar and restaurant. A former coaching inn dating back over 300 years, it is located on Main Street in the heart of the old village. There are also at least two B&B; establishments in the village. =Nearby Places of Interest= Inverkip is fairly central for other attractions, including Greenock town centre and the holiday town of Largs, which is 9 miles down the Clyde coast.

NCADD is built on a foundation of participation by members from the medical, scientific, political and social fields which provides a multi-pronged approach to the disease of alcohol and drug addiction. It has a national network of affiliates.  History  Marty Mann, the first female to achieve sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), organized the National Committee for Education on Alcoholism (NCEA) in 1944, which later became the National Council on Alcoholism (NCA) in 1950 and then NCADD in 1990 to address concern with other drugs. The organization was established to serve a dual purpose: first to have a proactive national education and advocacy program attacking the stigma and misunderstanding about alcoholism, treatment and recovery; second, to operate service centers in communities across the country staffed by professionals helping individuals/families with alcohol problems. Those service centers grew into the NCADD Affiliate Network.  Accomplishments  * Defined \\"alcoholism\\" as a disease and successfully worked for its adoption by the American Medical Association (AMA). * Formed the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM). * Created the first workplace-based employee assistance program and published the first EAP Standards and Program Manual. * Hosted the first public news conference to confront stigma and celebrate recovery with over 50 prominent individuals. * Established Alcohol Awareness Month. * Led effort for the 21-year old Minimum Drinking Age Act. * Leadership role in successful campaign for alcohol beverage container warning labels. * Successfully advocated for insurance coverage for alcoholism and addiction treatment equal to other illnesses.

He is the president and founder of Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm with principal offices in New York City. He is also a founder of digital media firm GZERO Media. Early life and education Bremmer is of Armenian and German descent. His father, Arthur, served in the Korean War and died at the age of 46 when Bremmer was four. He grew up in housing projects in Chelsea, Massachusetts, near Boston. Bremmer went to St. Dominic Savio High School in East Boston. He later earned a BA in international relations, magna cum laude, from Tulane University in 1989 and a PhD in political science from Stanford University in 1994, writing \\"The politics of ethnicity: Russians in the Ukraine\\".  Career  = Eurasia Group = Bremmer founded the political risk research and consulting firm Eurasia Group in 1998 in the offices of the World Policy Institute in New York City. The firm opened a London office in 2000, a Washington, DC office in 2005, a Tokyo office in 2015, San Francisco and S√£o Paulo offices in 2016, and Brasilia and Singapore offices in 2017. Initially focused on emerging markets, Eurasia Group has expanded to include frontier and developed economies, in addition to establishing practices focused on geo-technology and energy issues. Bremmer has co-authored Eurasia Group‚Äôs annual Top Risks report, a forecast of the 10 key geopolitical risks for the year ahead. = Writing = Bremmer has published ten books on global affairs. In addition, Bremmer is the foreign affairs columnist and editor-at- large for Time and a contributor for the Financial Times A-List. = Appointments = Bremmer has held research and faculty positions at New York University, Columbia University, the EastWest Institute, the World Policy Institute, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and the Asia Society Policy Institute, where he has served as the first Harold J. Newman Distinguished Fellow in Geopolitics since 2015. In 2013, he was named Global Research Professor at New York University. and in 2019, Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs announced that Bremmer would teach an Applied Geopolitics course at the school. Bremmer serves on the President's Council of the Near East Foundation, the Leadership Council for the Concordia Summit, and the board of trustees of Intelligence Squared. In 2007, he was named as a \\"Young Global Leader\\" of the World Economic Forum, and in 2010, founded and was appointed Chair of the Forum's Global Agenda Council for Geopolitical Risk. In December 2015, Bremmer was knighted by the government of Italy. Key concepts Bremmer's research fields include: international political economy, geoeconomics and geopolitics, states in transition and global emerging markets, and US foreign policy. =J-Curve= right Bremmer's J curveBremmer, Ian. 2006. The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall. Simon and Schuster. outlines the link between a country's openness and its stability. While many countries are stable because they are open (the United States, France, Japan), others are stable because they are closed (North Korea, Cuba, Iraq under Saddam Hussein). States can travel both forward (right) and backward (left) along this J curve, so stability and openness are never secure. The J is steeper on the left-hand side, as it is easier for a leader in a failed state to create stability by closing the country than to build a civil society and establish accountable institutions; the curve is higher on the far right because states that prevail in opening their societies (Eastern Europe, for example) ultimately become more stable than authoritarian regimes. The book was listed as a top 10 pick by The Economist in 2006. =State capitalism= Ian Bremmer describes state capitalism as a system in which the state dominates markets primarily for political gain. In his 2010 book The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations ), Bremmer describes China as the primary driver for the rise of state capitalism as a challenge to the free market economies of the developed world, particularly in the aftermath of the financial crisis. =G-Zero= The term G-Zero world refers to a breakdown in global leadership brought about by a decline of Western influence and the inability of other nations to fill the void.Gregory Scoblete. Will Free Markets Give Way to State Capitalism?, RealClearPolitics, May 28, 2010. It is a reference to a perceived shift away from the pre-eminence of the [\\"G7\\"] (\\"Group of Seven\\") industrialized countries and the expanded Group of Twenty, which includes major emerging powers like China, India, Brazil, Turkey, and others. In his book, Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World (New York: Portfolio, 2012), Bremmer explains that, in the G-Zero, no country or group of countries has the political and economic leverage to drive an international agenda or provide global public goods.Ian Bremmer and David Gordon.G-Zero , Foreign Policy, January 7, 2011.Ian Bremmer and Nouriel Roubini. A G-Zero World, Foreign Affairs, March/April 2011. =Weaponization of finance= The term weaponization of finance refers to the foreign policy strategy of using incentives (access to capital markets) and penalties (varied types of sanctions) as tools of coercive diplomacy. In his Eurasia Group Top Risks 2015 report, Bremmer coins the term weaponization of finance to describe the ways in which the United States is using its influence to affect global outcomes. Rather than rely on traditional elements of America's security advantage ‚Äì including US-led alliances such as NATO and multi-lateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ‚Äì Bremmer argues that the US is now 'weaponizing finance' by limiting access to the American marketplace and to US banks as an instrument of its foreign and security policy. =Pivot state= Bremmer uses pivot state to describe a nation that is able to build profitable relationships with multiple other major powers without becoming overly reliant on any one of them. This ability to hedge allows a pivot state to avoid capture‚Äîin terms of security or economy‚Äîat the hands of a single country. In his book, Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World (New York: Portfolio, 2012),Bremmer, Ian. Every Nation for Itself, Bremmer explains how, in a volatile G-Zero world, the ability to pivot will take on increased importance. At the opposite end of the spectrum are shadow states frozen within the influence of a single power. For example, with significant trade ties with both the United States and Asia and formal security ties with NATO, Canada is an example of a pivot state hedged against a slowdown in or conflict with any single major power. Mexico, on the other hand, is a shadow state due to its overwhelming reliance on the US economy. = Geopolitical recession = Bremmer has coined the term ‚Äúgeopolitical recession‚Äù to describe the current geopolitical environment, one defined by an unwind of the former US-led global order. Unlike economic recessions, linked to frequent boom and bust cycles, Bremmer see geopolitical recessions as much longer cycles, and accordingly are less likely to be recognized. He see the present geopolitical recession as defined by deteriorating relations between the US and its traditional allies‚Äîparticularly the Europeans‚Äîas China is rising but creating alternative international political and economic architecture. Bremmer argues that the overall result is a more fragmented approach to global governance, an increase in geopolitical tail risks, and a reduced ability to respond effectively to major international crises when they do hit. = World Data Organization = Bremmer proposed creating a ‚ÄúWorld Data Organization‚Äù to forestall a division in technology ecosystems due to conflict between the United States and China. He described it as a digital version of the World Trade Organization, arguing that the United States, Europe, Japan, and other ‚Äúgovernments that believe in online openness and transparency‚Äù should collaborate to set standards for artificial intelligence, data, privacy, citizens‚Äô rights, and intellectual property. 2020 Democratic party presidential nominee candidate Andrew Yang expressed his support for such an organization during his campaign.  Other organizations  =Eurasia Group Foundation= In 2016, Bremmer founded the Eurasia Group Foundation (EGF), a 501(c)3 public charity. Bremmer currently serves as the Eurasia Group Foundation‚Äôs board president. =GZERO Media= In 2017, Bremmer and Eurasia Group launched digital media company GZERO Media, and a US national public television show called GZERO World with Ian Bremmer on PBS. The company‚Äôs name refers to the term coined by Bremmer in Every Nation for Itself to describe a world where no country or group of countries has the political and economic leverage to drive an international agenda or provide global public goods.  Controversies  In March 2016, Bremmer sent a weekly note to clients where he unintentionally came up with the ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù slogan used by Donald Trump. The note described then-candidate Trump's foreign policy as not isolationist but \\"America First,\\" a transactional, unilateralist perspective that was more a Chinese than American framework for foreign policy. Bremmer used the term to help explain Trump‚Äôs foreign policy views and not as a campaign slogan. A few weeks later New York Times reporters David Sanger and Maggie Haberman, both of whom receive Bremmer's weekly note, conducted Trump‚Äôs first foreign policy interview and asked him if he would describe himself as an isolationist. He said no. They then asked Trump if he considered himself America First. Trump said yes and liked the term so much he started using it himself. Haberman later credited Bremmer with coming up with ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù to describe Trump‚Äôs foreign policy. In July 2017, Bremmer broke news of a second, previously undisclosed meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin during the G20 heads of state dinner in Hamburg. He wrote about the meeting in his weekly client note and later appeared on Charlie Rose to discuss the meeting‚Äôs implications. The news was quickly picked up by other major media outlets. Newsweek profiled Bremmer in an article titled \\"Who is Eurasia Group‚Äôs Ian Bremmer, the risk consultant who exposed the second Trump-Putin meeting?\\" Trump initially denied that his second meeting with Putin happened and called Bremmer \\"fake news.\\" However, then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders later held a press conference and admitted the second meeting indeed happened. In 2019, Bremmer was criticized on Twitter for posting a tweet that appeared to quote Trump. The tweet read: \\"President Trump in Tokyo: 'Kim Jong Un is smarter and would make a better President than Sleepy Joe Biden.'\\" After the tweet went viral, Bremmer acknowledged on Twitter that President Trump did not in fact say that quote and apologized on Twitter. President Trump used the incident to call for stronger libel laws. Selected bibliography * Soviet Nationalities Problems.

The storm caused levees to fail, releasing tens of billions of gallons of water. The levee failure contributed to extensive flooding in the New Orleans area and surrounding parishes. About 80% of all structures in Orleans Parish sustained water damage. Over 204,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and more than 800,000 citizens displaced ‚Äî the greatest displacement in the United States since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Wind damage was less severe than predicted. The damage that took place that needed to be repaired cost about $125 billion. Reconstruction was hindered by bureaucratic problems and funding issues with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Relief agencies provided supplemental relief. By mid-June 2006, the city was again hosting conventions and promoting tourism. After the flooding: Building displays lines from various levels of long standing floodwaters and has been deemed \\"unhabitable\\". Reconstruction On Monday, September 5, 2005, residents were allowed to come back and inspect their homes after the storm. Some areas were again gaining electricity in downtown New Orleans. By September 6, the Mayor ordered that all persons be evacuated from the city due to contaminated water and unlivable conditions. Though some areas had electricity again, sufficient food and supplies would still be weeks away in coming to the estimated 5,000‚Äì10,000 New Orleans residents still in the city. =Levee and pump repairs= The Corps of Engineers repaired the 55 levee breaches including the Industrial Canal, 17th Street Canal, and London Avenue Canal since shortly after the storm, and continues to work on mitigating the risk posed by flooding. =Utilities= Testing found the flood waters were not unusual. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in March 2006 declared all parts of New Orleans safe; no soil was contaminated and the air quality was pure. Water and sewage services were gradually restored. The first section of the city to have a \\"boil water\\" order lifted was in the high ground of the old crescent along the River from the French Quarter to old Carrollton on 6 October 2005. The last section of the city to have such an order lifted (a section of the Lower 9th Ward) was on 9 October 2006. Federal funding debate Some people, including Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, questioned whether federal funds should pay to rebuild New Orleans. Others consider New Orleans's unique cultural heritage and history to be as important to the United States as, for instance, Venice is to Italy; they maintain that to not rebuild and reoccupy the city would be an immeasurable loss in that regard. The Times-Picayune ran a front-page editorial arguing for national help. It has been argued that since the US Army Corps of Engineers has had oversight over the levee system since the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and most of the destruction in the city occurred due to the levee failure, the federal government should be responsible for rebuilding. Senator Mary Landrieu said that Louisiana's off-shore petroleum leases generate billions of dollars in revenues for the federal government's general fund, more than would be needed to restore wetlands and upgrade levee/flood control for South Louisiana to withstand category 5 storms. She argued that the federal government should either earmark some of that income for such projects or allow Louisiana to keep a significant portion of that revenue so the state could take care of its needs itself. If New Orleans is not rebuilt, it will sink. They need to rebuild New Orleans. Rebuilding, social justice, and community life Frederic Schwartz, the architect selected by the citizens of New Orleans and the New Orleans City Planning Commission to re-plan one third of the city for 40% of its populationSchwartzArch website, retrieved February 26, 2011. explained how the opportunity for rebuilding the city could be a chance to strengthen social justice and community life: > The planning of cities in the face of disaster (natural and political) must > reach beyond the band-aid of short-term recovery. Disaster offers a unique > opportunity to rethink the planning and politics of our metro-regional areas > ‚Äì it is a chance to redefine our cities and to reassert values of > environmental care and social justice, of community building and especially > of helping the poor with programs for quality, affordable, and sustainable > housing.Schwartz, Frederic, \\"New Orleans Now: Design and Planning After the > Storm,\\" in \\"Natural Metaphor: An Anthology of Essays on Architecture and > Nature\\", retrieved February 21, 2011. As lead planners for District 4, the district that includes the \\"largest concentration of public housing in the city\\" (Iberville, St. Bernard, Lafitte, and B. W. Cooper), Schwartz challenged his team to make \\"every effort to involve the residents and the community in the planning effort,\\" while ensuring that the design of the new housing \\"could maintain the look and feel of surrounding neighborhoods with a mix of both modern interpretation of historic typologies and new urbanist models.\\" Relief agencies Lining up at a Red Cross food & supply center in a formerly flooded Uptown neighborhood, mid October 2005 Relief agencies helped many returnees. The American Red Cross made a belated but nonetheless significant entry into the city in mid- September; and by the start of October had a number of relief centers set up around the city. These provided hot meals, packaged food, bottled water and other supplies like diapers, mops, and dust masks. The Salvation Army also had many stations giving food. Temporary free clinics provided some medical care. Towards the end of 2005, the relief centers were wound down, starting with those in functioning parts of the city. Red Cross meals continued at a much smaller scale into 2006 from trucks traveling around the worst-hit and poorest neighborhoods. The Southern Baptist Convention sent feeding units to New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast the day after Katrina struck New Orleans. Since this time, the Southern Baptist Convention through its North American Mission Board established an ongoing project called Operation Noah Rebuild, (not to be confused with the Operation Noah sponsored by the City of New Orleans) which has hosted thousands of volunteers and teams from all over the United States. The volunteer teams helped in the reconstruction efforts in New Orleans and the surrounding parishes. First Baptist Church of New Orleans worked hand-in-hand with Habitat for Humanity with the Baptist Crossroads Project, in an effort to rebuild homes in the Upper Ninth Ward. Food Not Bombs was active in providing food early after the disaster. A community kitchen was set up first in Washington Square in Faubourg Marigny; after a few months it was moved to a park by Bayou St. John before being closed down. A number of church groups and smaller charities set up aid for a time. Common Ground Collective had two relief centers in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, providing food, clothing, and a tool library. The larger center was in the Upper 9th Ward, with a smaller one in the worst hit part of the Lower 9th Ward. They also helped gutting houses. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began bringing in load after load of food and water for local members and residents to several areas of the city. Thousands of church members came in on rotating weekends to help clean up debris, gut houses and cut up fallen trees all over the city. In addition to the home repairs, the church full-time counselors were available to provide mental health assistance; and church employment centers ‚Äî offices that aid with finding jobs ‚Äî opened their doors to everyone, regardless of religion. Habitat for Humanity has been active in building homes at an accelerated pace since the storm. Initially, the organization had volunteers gutting homes; but since returned to its primary mission of fighting poverty housing. Catholic Charities also was very active with volunteers repairing damaged houses and churches throughout the area. Camp Hope in Violet, LA housed volunteers in the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort of St. Bernard Parish since June 1, 2006. Gentilly neighborhood, January 2006. Build Now is a non-profit organization that played an active part in bringing New Orleans families back home. The non-profit, a licensed and insured residential contractor, constructed site-built, elevated houses on hurricane-damaged lots. The homes reflect the style and quality of traditional New Orleans architecture. Build Now brought more than a dozen New Orleans families back home, including construction around the Lakeview, Gentilly and the Upper and Lower Ninth Ward areas. The organization moved New Orleans families back home since beginning operations in 2008. The Jazz Foundation of America is a non-profit organization that helped New Orleans musicians directly by paying the first month's rent for new homes, getting nearly $250,000 worth of donated instruments to musicians, giving pro bono counseling, advocacy, legal counseling, and creating a long term employment program that put displaced musicians back to work performing free concerts in schools and nursing homes, in eight states. In 2005 The foundation held an auction to benefit musicians affected by Hurricane Katrina globalrhythm.net. 2009-13-10.

(Archived by globalrhythm.net at http://www.globalrhythm.net/WorldNews/JazzFoundationAuctionWillBenefitMusiciansHurtbyKatrina.cfm) Thanks to the generosity of the foundation's chairwoman, Ms. Agnes Varis, they were able to create employment programs which have made it possible to keep the artists and their music alive in New Orleans.jazzfoundation.org. 2009-13-10.

In early 2006, the RAND Corporation estimated that, even in 2008, the city's population would only be little more than half what it was before the storm hit; however by July 2007 the city's population was estimated at about 2/3 (or close to 300,000 residents) of that before the disaster.for the role of civil society in the process of rebuilding New Orleans, see: Michael S. Falser: Der Wiederaufbau von New Orleans nach Hurricane Katrina ‚Äì Gedanken zum Status der Zivilgesellschaft im Kontext von Natur- und Kulturkatastrophen.

Even in 2009, many homes and homeowners were still devastated. Some organizations, like the statewide Louisiana Disaster Relief Foundation or the neighborhood-based United Saints Recovery Project are still working to provide support to homeowners in rebuilding their homes. The areas with little or no flooding were the first to be officially reopened, have utilities restored, and a sizable portion of residents and businesses return. Flooded-out areas presented more problems. The city had no comprehensive plan for what to do about flooded areas. Thousands of property owners have been gutting and repairing their property, some in the lowest lying areas of town. Contractors and workers from out-of-state and other countries came in great numbers doing demolition and reconstruction work, some filling hotels and rental property, others living in trailers and tent cities set up in city parks and parking lots. Sportscaster Mike Tirico incorrectly generalized on Monday Night Football in September 2006, some areas, like the Lower Ninth Ward and Gentilly, still looked as badly damaged as the day the storm passed through. However, in each of those neighborhoods thousands of truckloads of debris were removed, hundreds of unsalvageable houses demolished, and work on gutting and repairs has been constant since the city has reopened. Hundreds, if not thousands, of New Orleanians lived in the largely intact upper stories of their homes while the flood damaged downstairs got repaired, often being stripped to the wall studs in the process. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set up the \\"Blue Roof Program\\" of putting blue tarps over damaged roofs. The tarps kept out rain until more permanent roof repairs could be made. Thousands of blue tarps were seen throughout the city; however, a number of official restrictions meant some residents were unable to benefit from this recovery program. Likewise, a number of subcontractors paid by the Corps only did \\"easy\\" low-pitch one-story roofs, choosing not to return to do more difficult roofs. Some New Orleanians lived for months in homes with sizable holes in their roofs. Among the popular handouts at Red Cross relief stations were 5-gallon buckets, many put to use as rain catchers. Six months after the storm, many of the hastily placed blue roof tarps were in tatters, leaving those homes vulnerable again. Many people did not succeed in getting permanent roof repairs from such reasons as long waiting lists for reliable contractors and waits for insurance payment. Broadmoor has complaint about no electricity painted on side; 3 April 2006 Seven months after the storm, two-thirds of the requested FEMA trailers (designed for short term emergency housing immediately after a disaster) had been delivered. Many of these trailers, however, could not be occupied or, if occupied, were not properly functional. Delays of weeks or months in hooking up electricity and water to trailers were common, and mechanical and bureaucratic problems prevented use of the trailers. In June 2006, the State of Louisiana finally awarded a contract to DRC, Inc. of Mobile, Alabama to remove thousands of abandoned cars strewn throughout New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. =Differing circumstances= Reconstruction has been easiest and quickest in the areas least damaged by the storm, mostly corresponding to the parts of the city developed before about 1900. These areas were built on naturally higher ground along the River front (such as Old Carrollton, Uptown, the Old Warehouse District, the French Quarter, Old Marigny, and Bywater), along with areas along natural ridges (such as Esplanade Ridge, Bayou St. John, Gentilly Ridge). Most of these older areas had no flooding at all or escaped serious flooding because of the raised design of older architecture which prevented floodwaters from entering homes. Another high area, much of which escaped serious flooding, was the set of Lake Shore developments between Lake Pontchartrain and Robert E. Lee Boulevard, built at a higher level than nearby land from mid-20th century dredging. Due to the direction of the storm and the movement of storm surge, the West Bank section of the city, Algiers was spared flooding and became the first part of the city itself to officially reopen to residents. In neighboring Jefferson Parish, the West Bank communities were similarly spared all but some wind damage (with a few spots of minor rain-generated flooding). On the East Bank, while parts of Metairie and other Jefferson communities experienced some flooding, due to lack of levee breaches this was much less severe than across the Parish line in Orleans (or the devastation of the 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane which flooded most of Jefferson's East Bank). Reconstruction of each section of the area has been addressed in the Army Corps LACPR Final Technical Report which identifies areas to not be rebuilt and areas buildings need to be elevated. The Technical Report includes locations of possible new levees; suggested existing levee modifications; \\"Inundation Zones\\"; \\"Water depths less than 14 feet, Raise-In-Place of Structures\\"; \\"Water depths greater than 14 feet, Buyout of Structures\\"; \\"Velocity Zones\\"; and \\"Buyout of Structures\\" areas for five different scenarios. The Corps of Engineers will submit the report to Congress for consideration, planning, and response in mid-2009. A larger percentage of white residents returned to their homes than did black residents. This was attributed to an unwillingness of planners to rebuild low- income housing.\\"The Disneyfication of New Orleans\\" \\"The Guardian UK\\" August 28, 2008.

Caseworkers had to help some former residents realize that moving back was unrealistic because some of the city was not being rebuilt. This created a diaspora as many evacuees wished to return to New Orleans but were not able to.Sterett, Susan. 2015. [‚ÄúDisaster, Displacement, and Casework: Uncertainty and Assistance after Hurricane Katrina]‚Äù Law & Policy. Large areas of the city's public housing were targeted for demolition, inciting vocal protests from some, including architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff. =Homeless residents= A challenge facing New Orleans was the exceptionally large homeless population created by Katrina. The number of homeless people living in New Orleans doubled to 12,000 people between the hurricane and mid-2007.\\"Homeless camp appears near City Hall\\", \\"WWLTV New Orleans\\" July 25, 2007. Retrieved August 28, 2008. With a post- Katrina population of 300,000 people, this meant that 1 in 25 people were homeless, an extremely high number and nearly three times that of any other US city.For comparison, Atlanta, which comes second nationally among major cities in its homelessness rate to post-Katrina New Orleans, has a homelessness rate of 1.4%. Most of the homeless were Katrina evacuees who returned to higher rents or who fell through the cracks of the federal system that was to provide temporary housing after the disaster. There were also some workers who came from out of state for the post-Katrina rebuilding boom but who subsequently lost their jobs. \\"New Orleans' homeless rate swells to 1 in 25\\" \\"USA Today\\" March 17, 2008. Retrieved August 28, 2008. Compounding this problem, the number of beds for the homeless in the city decreased from a count of 2,800 before the storm, to 2,000, as of May 2008.\\"Resources Scarce, Homelessness Persists in New Orleans\\", \\"The New York Times\\" May 28, 2008. Retrieved August 28, 2008. The New Orleans Legal Assistance Corporation's Homeless Department worked overtime in January 2009 and reevaluated the homelessness rate. They found that the post-Katrina homeless population decreased by 64% since the last survey two years prior.\\"Homeless Problems\\" \\"New Orleans Legal Assistance\\" Retrieved January 13, 2009. UNITY of Greater New Orleans reported 1,188 homeless people after their 2018 Point-in-Time count performed in January. As of 2018, New Orleans has maintained a \\"functional zero\\" in veteran homelessness for three years. Going forward, UNITY's efforts are focused on support for chronically homeless people with physical and/or mental disabilities. = Neighborhood and community-based organizations = Neighborhood and community-based organizations played a significant role in the reconstruction effort after Katrina. Neighborhood associations and resident-leaders from communities across the city established an information- sharing network called the Neighborhoods Partnership Network (NPN) where they shared lessons learned through the rebuilding process with each other as well as information about important upcoming citywide or neighborhood planning meetings, resources (on volunteers, tools, programs and application processes, etc.), and calls and offers for help and collaboration. Network members shared information and resources identified through the network with their own communities and neighbors. Early on, members also used NPN as a way to identify and collectively point out issues and collective priorities to local government officials and agencies and propose possible solutions. The network eventually established a newspaper, The Trumpet, that was circulated locally to disseminate information, highlight and celebrate progress, and to facilitate connections for collaboration. Businesses Bars were the first businesses to reopen in many areas; two remained open in the French Quarter even during the worst of the storm and the official mandatory evacuation. Most other businesses, such as gas stations, appliance stores, and supermarkets, followed somewhat later as they required more work before they could reopen. Three months after the storm, most open restaurants were serving food and drink in disposable plates and cups because of the shortage of dishwashers. Despite many restaurants offering wages double pre-Katrina levels for dishwashers, there were few takers as untrained laborers were able to make more money in demolition- and reconstruction-related industries. Ten months later, things had improved, though there were still labor shortages in many service industries. Some of the few businesses to do significantly better business after Katrina than before were new car dealers. Flooding totaled an estimated 200,000 vehicles in Metro New Orleans, and dealers able to get in shipments of new cars quickly found customers. After local reporters found a used car dealer selling partially cleaned up flooded cars with restored engines but still soggy trunks, the state legislature quickly passed legislation mandating that cars declared totaled must be dismantled, crushed, or otherwise disposed of and could not be resold. Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu (who later became Mayor of New Orleans) declared that Louisiana housed America's soul, and its revival was of paramount importance.Landrieu, Mitch. Louisiana Recovery and Rebuilding Conference. New Orleans. Nov. 2005. Speech. As New Orleans began reviving its local businesses, the reestablishment of the city's restaurants, particularly mom and pop eateries, received fervent local and national support. New Orleans's cuisine has largely maintained its cultural distinctiveness, linking its citizens with the city's creole roots. Long before Hurricane Katrina, 'local' food in New Orleans represented a framework for discussing America's racial binary ‚Äì a paradigm in which the city has generally attempted to resist. Thus, even if race prevented a portion of New Orleanians from \\"[acknowledging] that they do, indeed, share one culture\\", culture became recognized as \\"something shared around which the city's residents could rally\\" during an arduous rebuild. By emphasizing the restoration of not only New Orleans's economic but also its cultural capital, the city yielded the additional benefit of a reinvigorated social capital. Tourism and events The American Library Association held its annual convention in New Orleans in June 2006; the estimated 18,000 attendees represented the first citywide convention in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina. The National Association of Realtors also held their annual convention in New Orleans bringing 30,000 attendees to the city in November 2006.New Orleans & Louisiana Local Business News ‚Äì NOLA.com The HIMSS healthcare information technology convention and the American College of Cardiology convention, both held in the spring of 2007, each had more than 24,000 attendees.New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau , Retrieved 07-04-2007 The Essence Music Festival returned to the Crescent City in July 2007 after being displaced to Houston in 2006. Several national travel guides have once again listed New Orleans as one of the top five places to visit in the country. The Bayou Classic, the traditional football game between Southern University and Grambling State University, returned in November 2006 after being displaced to Houston for its 2005 game. The National Football League made a commitment to the city with the return of the New Orleans Saints, following speculation about a move to San Antonio or Los Angeles. The National Basketball Association has made a commitment with the return of the New Orleans Hornets, which played in both New Orleans and Oklahoma City, in the 2005‚Äì06 and 2006‚Äì07 seasons, returning fully for the 2007‚Äì08 season. (Oklahoma City became a permanent member of the NBA in the 2007‚Äì08 season.) New Orleans was granted the 2008 NBA All Star Game, which usually generates millions of dollars in revenue for the host city. Tulane University hosted the first and second rounds of the 2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. The Superdome has since hosted several college football bowl games, and a Super Bowl. The New Orleans Bowl resumed in December 2006, and the Sugar Bowl and 2008 BCS National Championship Game took in January 2008. New Orleans hosted the Super Bowl in 2013 for the first time since Hurricane Katrina. In February 2010, the New Orleans Saints won Super Bowl XLIV. In mid-March 2007 a local group of investors began conducting a study to see if the city could support a Major League Soccer team. Major seasonal events such as New Orleans Mardi Gras and the Jazz and Heritage Festival were never displaced, occurring at other times of year.

Matthew Scully (born March 30, 1959) is an American author, journalist, and speechwriter. Early life Scully was born in Casper, Wyoming And lived his childhood throughout Colorado, Ohio, and New York,. He attended Arizona State University in the 1980s. He married Emmanuelle Boers in 1998. They have two sons. They lived in Virginia during the Bush years, and in 2008 when Matthew was working for the McCain/Palin campaign. After John McCain lost to Barack Obama, they moved back to Los Angeles California. Then in 2013 moved to Phoenix Arizona and currently live there. Career Scully worked as a speechwriter in the 2000 presidential campaign, and served as a special assistant and senior speechwriter for President George W. Bush from January 2001 to August 2004. He also wrote speeches for vice-presidents Dan Quayle and Dick Cheney, Governor Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, and Bob Dole. In an article in The Atlantic, Scully accused former White House chief speechwriter Michael Gerson of wrongfully taking credit for speeches allegedly written by Scully and other members of President George W. Bush's speechwriting team. =Palin acceptance speech= Prior to the 2008 Republican National Convention, Senator John McCain (the Republican Presidential nominee to-be) asked Scully to write the acceptance speech for his Vice Presidential nominee, whom McCain had not yet chosen. Scully wrote the speech two weeks before the convention. He wrote the speech for a man to deliver, not a woman. Four days before the convention, Scully was surprised when he was informed that Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was to be McCain's running mate. Scully then worked all night to tailor the speech to Palin and also to incorporate new campaign strategy shifts that were being rapidly formed in intensive discussions by McCain campaign staff. Palin delivered the 40-minute speech at the convention on September 3, 2008. =Melania Trump 2016 Convention Speech= Scully was hired along with John McConnell to write \\"the biggest speech of Melania Trump‚Äôs life,\\" to be delivered on July 18, 2016, at the 2016 Republican National Convention.

Written by Tom Batiuk and drawn by Dan Davis,https://comicskingdom.com/crankshaft#authors Crankshaft is a spin-off from Batiuk‚Äôs comic strip Funky Winkerbean. Prior to April 2, 2017, the strip was drawn by Chuck Ayers. Characters and Setting * Ed (Edward Roger Dale) Crankshaft, Sr., is a widower with two daughters and a son (Eddie) who died as an infant. Crankshaft is a World War II veteran who, in his youth, was an aspiring baseball player who never made it to the major leagues (he played for the Toledo Mud Hens at his highest level) due to the conniving of another team member. He drives a school bus for a living and is part of the company bowling team (though he is not a great bowler). He often acts irritable, angry, upset or grumpy to cover up the fact that he actually does have a soft, sweet side. * Pam Murdoch, Crankshaft's daughter, is a major fixture and is married to Jeff and has two children. * Max and Mindy Murdoch are the children of Pam and Jeff and Ed's grandchildren. * Chris, Crankshaft's other daughter, lives in New York City and only occasionally appears in the strips. * Rocky and Bill, are bus drivers who are Crankshaft's co-workers. * Lillian and Lucy McKenzie, neighbours to Crankshaft, are two elderly sisters who share a house (one has since died). * Morgan and Chase Lambert are a young couple who also live in the neighbourhood. * Ralph Meckler is Crankshaft's best friend and is married to Helen. He is currently running for Mayor of Centerville. * Lena is the manager of the bus garage where Crankshaft works. She is known for her undrinkable coffee and inedible baked cookies and brownies. * Andy Clark and Rocky Rhodes are two of Crankshaft's co-workers. Andy is a middle-aged black man and habitually wears a green cap, while Rocky is a young white man and has a goatee. * Lois is Crankshaft's girlfriend. * The Roughriders were the toughest, most difficult kids in the Teddy Roosevelt High School district and frequent passengers on Crankshaft's bus. They are: :* Angel, a single mother. :* Marcus :* Shane :* Cobey :* Severo Crankshaft is known for recurring running gags, such as: *all the bus drivers insulting the cooking efforts (especially the brownies and coffee) of Lena, a co-worker. Lena serves as the drivers' supervisor. *Crankshaft constantly trying to outrun kids (and their mothers) who miss the bus *Crankshaft's coming up with different labor-saving gadgets (which often don't work or cause more damage) *pouring too much lighter fluid on the grill, causing it to explode whenever the grill is lit As a result, the family enjoys a friendly relationship with the Centerville Fire Department. *neighbor George Keesterman's mailbox getting destroyed on a daily basis by the school bus (although some strips have George Keesterman saving his mail box in time).http://www.chron.com/apps/comics/showComick.mpl?date=20101114&name;=Crankshaft *Crankshaft blowing out his back and being laid up and not caring for it (the strip finds humor in somewhat depressing situations) *The strip is famous for its flashbacks which include, but are not limited to, Crankshaft's days as a baseball player. *Crankshaft is heavily involved with the Centerville Garden Club in which the strip includes him speaking to other club members which mostly include ladies. Continuity The continuity of Crankshaft is as much as twenty years behind that of Funky Winkerbean; strips in both comics in August and September 2011 show a character in the latter strip, a high school teacher with a daughter of her own, as a college-age student in the former. Batiuk has tackled many serious issues in the strip, including: *Adult literacy: When Crankshaft revealed to his family that he could not read, the strip followed his efforts to learn. *Alzheimer's disease and dementia: One of Crankshaft's friends, Ralph, has a spouse who no longer recognizes him. A neighbor, Lucy McKenzie, also exhibited symptoms and moved to a nursing home. The character died in the March 7th, 2009, strip. *Access to higher education among the poor: Crankshaft recognized that the students on his bus route would never better themselves if they did not attend college, yet they were too poor to do so. Therefore, Crankshaft sold an extensive collection of movie posters to set up a fund so they could attend college after graduation.

Daily strips commencing July 20, 2009, appear to show Ed Crankshaft in a state of grave decline, his life flashing before his eyes as he attends a Little League baseball game.

Distributed by King Features Syndicate, the strip ran from August 13, 1928, until August 24, 1996. Characters and story When Tim Tyler's Luck started in 1928, Tyler was living in an orphanage. However, he soon left the orphanage for the outside world. When he teamed with an older sidekick, Spud, they began globe-trotting for a series of international adventures. Many tales took place in Africa, as noted by comic strip historian Don Markstein: :By the time the Sunday version started (July 19, 1931), Tim and Spud were well away from the orphanage, living a life of adventure. At first, their adventures tended to be light and cartoony, but later, with Buck Rogers, Dick Tracy and the like gaining popularity, the strip took a more serious turn. Tim and Spud traveled the world before settling for several years in Africa, where (having grown into their late teens or so) they joined the Ivory Patrol and spent their time chasing after poachers and the like. They returned to America during World War II, where they mostly dealt with spies and saboteurs. Afterward, they went traveling again, eventually returning to Africa, where they remained for good.Markstein, Don.

Alfieri Francesco Ferdinando Alfieri was a master of fencing of the 17th century, representative of the Venetian school of fencing and ‚ÄúMaestro D‚ÄôArme‚Äù to the Accademia Delia in Padua in 1640. Alfieri originally from Padua, at that time it was considered the territory of the Venetian Republic. Most of the Venetian and Italian fencing masters in their treaties refer to the famous fencing master Francesco Alfieri as an unsurpassed master of fencing, in many other sources, treatises and other documents outside of Italy and Venice, you can also find various references. Here is what Blasco Florio says about him in his treatise \\"The Science of Fencing with the sword of Blasco Florio\\" (La scienza della scherma esposta da Blasco Florio): Works Several treatises by Alfieri are known: * La Bandiera (\\"The Ensign\\" or \\"Flag\\"), published in 1638, which treats flag drill * La Scherma (\\"Fencing\\"), published in 1640 and reprinted in 1645, which treats rapier fencing * La Picca (\\"The Pike\\"), published in 1641, which treats pike drill and also appends the entirety of his treatise on flag drill * L‚Äôarte di ben maneggiare la spada (\\"The Art of Handling the Sword Well\\"), published in 1653 and reprinted in 1683, which includes the entirety of his treatise on rapier fencing and appends a section on the use of the Spadone (two-handed sword). * \\"The Art of Excellent Possession of the Sword\\", includes his entire treatise on fencing with arapier and added a section on the use of Spadone (a two- handed sword). Treatise \\"The Art of Excellent Possession of the Sword\\". Francesco Alfieri The ancient treatise Francesco Alfieri 1653 edition of the \\"L'arte di ben maneggiare la spada\\" - from the Italian language was translated by scientists and masters of fencing into Russian. The book was published under the title \\"The Art of Excellent Possession of the Sword\\". The translation was made by the Research Institute \\"World Traditions of Martial Arts and Criminal Investigations of the Use of Weapons\\" in cooperation with the School of Spanish Fencing \\"Destreza Achinech\\"  The art of excellent swordplay  Francesco Alfieri's treatise \\"The Art of Excellent Sword Ownership\\" aroused great admiration among the masters of fencing and respect, as it became one of the most popular fencing books. Even in the modern world of fencing this treatise is considered to be in the field of fencing one of the best textbooks. One of the disciples described in this way the treatise of his Great teacher: The treatise \\"The Art of Excellent Sword Hold\\" reflects Francesco Alfieri's thought and opinion on Fencing, the author described the complete basic set of ways and methods, the advantages that a person can gain in combat and in everyday life from studying the Art of Arms. Alfieri, one of not many authors, described how the art of fencing can be made useful and how to become the best master in this matter. This treatise has come down to our days and conveyed all of its wisdom and practice of using weapons. The treatise is written - in the language of the heart, as the followers of Alfieri say, in which the causes and principles of fencing grow, respectively, in the application of which fear and insecurity in combat disappear. Francesco Alfieri is considered an unsurpassed master of fencing, at that time he gathered all his practice and experience in science and tried to convey this all in his work, brought his new Mixed Martial position. A mixed military position, introduced by Francesco Alfieri The mixed combat position is a proportional position and is suitable for moving into the Counterboy position against the First, Second, Third, Fourth combat positions. Also here you can use a high position form, for example, to reject a blow in the Third position - outward or in the inner part, then you need to take the fourth battle position. Thus, the enemy will not be able to free himself, which is very important for striking. In this situation, it is harmful to perform direct movements, they can be fatal. If you do not want to be stabbed, you can find your way, how to change the shape, and then continue fencing. In this case, it is better to do everything in order to maintain a favorable position without any restrictions, also find other convenient moments, strike with the attack in any closer open part of the opponent's body. This Mixed martial position allowed Alfieri to end all fights with a victory, so he preferred to use it more often than most others, used for protection and for striking the opponent. In addition, the author examined the main types of weapons that were most used at that time, considered separately the features of their use, principles and true purpose, their observations and conclusions from practice. The weapons in question are: a sword, a dagger, a dropon, a kapa, a targa, a broker, namely in a treatise such topics as: First part: *Basic principles of fencing. *On the formation of the knight. *On the forms of art. *Methods of determining the shape. *About time in art. *On the combat positions. *About moving the body and steps. *On the features of the first and second combat positions. *About the Third and Fourth Combat Positions and their advantages. *On deviations and their varieties. *About feints. *How can you understand the nature and art of the enemy. *What you need to counteract the shock when the legs are still or in a step. *On the Counterboy Position. *Where you need to be in combat. *Ways to strike and the nature of the blows. *How to deal with shy, reckless, phlegmatic and choleric. *The advantages between strength and weakness. *Advantages between big and small. *The choice between the movement in the fighting position and the waiting. The second and third parts of the treatise Francesco Alfieri are devoted to a detailed consideration of such topics as: *Formation of combat positions, attack and defense. *Inflicting various blows with a sword, a sword and a dagger, a dropon, etc. in different positions. *Separately examined the types of protective weapons and how to use them. *Controls from the dropdown, as well as the ways and methods of using this weapon in defense and attack, management features.

Francesco Alfieri On the use of the tip and the application of cutting strokes with a dropdown. Francesco Alfieri Parry and strike simultaneously. Francesco Alfieri }  Features and distinctive features in Italian fencing  Treatise Francesco Alfieri \\"The art of excellent possession of the sword\\" laid the foundation of Italian fencing, which appeared at that time. In his work, he draws attention to such features and distinctive features in Italian fencing: *The attack is equal to the defense. There is no separation between attack and defense, parrying is not carried out separately. There is a work with a straight line. When the enemy strikes, he passes by, and the swordsman at this point in time strikes. This method is used provided the knowledge of the sword device, its separation, the ability to work with a brush and forearm, as well as on the understanding of how to control the sword of the enemy in battle. *Blocking the movement of the opponent's free hand with his sword. This element is absent in other schools of fencing. *Blocking the sword by hand. At that moment in time, when a person strikes, that is, a piercing blow, the movement of the sword is inserted, as an obstacle, put out his hand in the glove, then the sword of the enemy begins to slip and go past. Further, the fencer with the other hand can freely apply the necessary blows. Francesco Alfieri in his work describes the mechanisms of the movement of the body or the ways of setting the enemy in a position where the fencer takes the sword to the opponent, unlike the other. A distinctive feature of this fencing is that this effect is achieved with the help of a straight line, and not at an angle, as in other schools of fencing. *Beat on the rotation. The use of the rotation motions of the column, formed when the body turns, is described quite a lot. The sword is skipped and a blow is struck on the rotation of the body. Also demonstrated how to disarm the enemy. *Strikes under the sword (from under the sword) of the enemy. Striking in the fourth combat position with the lifting of the coiled raincoat. Francesco Alfieri *Opposing the sword of the dagger. Of course, the dagger is shorter than the sword, so the dagger is parried with an executed attack with a sword. And since the dagger does not reach the body of the opponent, then the sword is struck exactly in the direction where the dagger is. *Parrying on the cross. Simultaneous parry with a dagger and sword. *Simultaneous striking with a dagger and a sword. *Practically there are no cutting and cutting blows. *In the main, punches are applied. *Winding a raincoat on your hand, which is used for protective purposes as a shield, which is typical of the Italian school of fencing. *Use a mixed fighting position with a cloak that is wrapped around the arm, and a sword. A wounded raincoat is set against the sword to protect itself from an enemy attack, and then a fatal wound is inflicted. *Use in defense and attack, throwing a cloak on a sword. Approach and reputation Alfieri was the first Italian swordsmanship author to amply quote, reference and comment on earlier masters. For instance, we know he was an ardent admirer of earlier Paduan sword master Salvator Fabris, whom he calls \\"a man of the greatest name in our profession.\\" On the other hand, he sharply criticises Achille Marozzo and Ridolfo Capoferro and strongly disagrees with some of their positions. In turn, Alfieri was amply quoted and praised by the late 17th-century Italian swordsmanship master Francesco Antonio Marcelli, giving us an indication that his teaching enjoyed some popularity in the 17th century.

UCB is an international company with a revenue of ‚Ç¨4.178 billion in 2016 which focuses primarily on research and development, specifically involving medications centered on epilepsy, Parkinson's, and Crohn's diseases. The company's efforts are focused on treatments for severe diseases treated by specialists, particularly in the fields of central nervous system (CNS) disorders (including epilepsy), inflammatory disorders (including allergy), and oncology. Every three years, the company presents the UCB Award under the patronage of the Queen Elisabeth Medical Foundation to promote neuroscience research. The winner of this award is selected by an independent scientific committee.  History  UCB was founded on 18 January 1928 by Emmanuel Janssen, a Belgian businessman. Initially focused on industrial chemicals (it was one of the first companies to distill ammonia from coal), the company also included a small pharmaceutical division based around Meurice Laboratories. In the early 1950s, UCB set up a research centre where new medicines such as Atarax (hydroxyzine) were developed. Successful sales enabled the pharmaceutical division to expand, and led to the discovery of another important compound, called piracetam. This was marketed in the 1970s as Nootropil and used to treat memory and balance problems. It remains one of UCB's key products. At this time, UCB was a company focusing on three core areas: pharmaceuticals, chemicals and films. The success of Nootropil made it possible for UCB to build a modern pharmaceutical site in Braine-l'Alleud, south of Brussels. There, UCB developed Zyrtec (cetirizine), a blockbuster antihistamine. Other important products have followed including Keppra (levetiracetam), Xyzal (levocetirizine), and Cimzia (certolizumab pegol), which was acquired through the acquisition of Celltech. At the end of 2002, the chemicals and films divisions were merged and UCB added the resins, additives and adhesives activities of Solutia, to form the surface specialties division. The films part has since been sold to Innovia Films in September 2004. The chemicals division, Methylamines and Derivatives was spun off and later sold to form the company Taminco. In May 2004, UCB acquired the British biotechnology company Celltech, followed in March 2005 by the sale of the surface specialties to Cytec Industries. By divesting all of its non-pharmaceutical activities, and acquiring Celltech (for $1 billion), UCB transformed itself into a global biopharmaceutical company. In 2006, UCB started the purchase of the German pharmaceutical company Schwarz for 4 billion.UCB S.A. Press Release of 25 September 2006; accessed on 12 September 2008. , UCB holds approximately 87% of Schwarz's outstanding shares. The purchase of Schwarz enabled UCB to introduce two new drugs against CNS disorders: Neupro (rotigotine), a transdermal patch for treatment of Parkinson's disease and Vimpat (lacosamide), a new anticonvulsant. Another new drug of the Schwarz portfolio, Toviaz (fesoterodine), a compound to treat overactive bladder, was licensed to Pfizer in 2006. In 2008, UCB established a multi-year collaboration with Beryllium, a developer of treatments for immune and CNS disorders. By 2014, this collaboration had yielded \\"significant scientific breakthroughs\\", which led to UCB acquiring a minority stake in the company. In November 2014, UCB announced its intention to sell of its generics subsidiary (Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals) for more than $1.5 billion to two private equity firms. In 2015, UCB announced the sale of its branded generics business in India and South Asia to Dr. Reddy's Laboratories for INR 8 billion ($128.38 million). In September of the same year the company off loaded its generics business to Lannett for $1.23 billion. In October 2019 UCB announced that it would acquire immune system disease specialist, Ra Pharma for $2.1 billion. On April 2, 2020, UCB announced that the acquisition has been successfully completed.  Notable drugs developed by UCB  * Atarax (hydroxyzine) * Briviact (Brivaracetam) * Nootropil (piracetam) * Zyrtec (cetirizine), an OTC antihistamine * Keppra (levetiracetam), an anticonvulsant medication used to treat epilepsy * Xyzal (levocetirizine), a third-generation non-sedative antihistamine * Cimzia (certolizumab pegol), a monoclonal antibody to TNF-Œ± for the treatment of Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis * Neupro (rotigotine), a transdermal patch for treatment of Parkinson's disease * Vimpat (lacosamide), an anticonvulsant * Atamet (carbidopa/levodopa) for Parkinson's disease  Corporate governance  Jean-Christophe Tellier became the CEO of UCB in January 2015. He is succeeding Roch Doliveux who was the CEO from 2004 until December 2014.  Operations  UCB has operations in over 40 countries and employs more than 7500 people.http://www.ucb.com/our- company/facts/company The United States specialty generics subsidiary was Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, established in 1904 and based in Princeton, New Jersey.

Plot  Tree-ear is an orphan who lives under a bridge with Crane-man, a physically disabled man who took him in when Tree-ear was only a small child. Tree-ear is fascinated with the nearby potters in his village, especially Min, and often watches them work. One day Tree-ear goes into Min's yard and investigates the work that he was drying in the sun. When Min comes out and startles Tree-ear, he drops and breaks a box. To pay for his mistake, Tree-ear offers to work for Min for nine days in order to pay for the box, which then turns into eighteen months. His jobs are to cut wood and put it into the pottery kiln, cut clay from the riverbanks for the potter Min to make into clay and drain clay to make it finer. As Tree-ear arrives for his first day of work, he feels a great deal of excitement at the idea of learning the craft of the potter. However, Min wants Tree-ear to cut wood for the communal kiln. For nine days, Tree-ear cuts wood for Min. When the nine days are over, Tree-ear returns to Min's and requests a continuing job. Min informs Tree-ear that he cannot pay him, but Tree-ear only wants to learn the trade, therefore, he does not expect payment. Min agrees, sending Tree-ear to the river for clay. One afternoon, word spreads throughout Ch'ulp'o that a royal emissary is coming to offer commissions to the best potters both in their village and another village down the coast. All the potters begin working at a fast pace in order to have their best work ready to display. During this time, Tree-ear notices some odd behavior in another potter, Kang. One night, Tree-ear sneaks up to Kang's work shed and sees him carving out flowers on the side of a vase and then filling the holes with colored clay. Tree-ear wants to tell Min what he has seen, but he is concerned that by doing so he would be stealing from Kang, so he waits. The day the royal emissary arrives, all the potters set up stalls on the beach filled with their work. Min's is the smallest display but it is one of a few that earns extra attention from the emissary. The emissary leaves, but will return in a month to offer commissions. The potters who received extra attention before again begin working quickly to prepare new samples for the emissary. Tree-ear tells Min about Kang's inlay work. Min immediately begins creating inlays in his own pottery. However, after the pottery is fired in the kiln, it all comes out with brown stains that sometimes appear in the finish. Min breaks them all and prepares to start over. Unfortunately, the emissary arrives before he can create anything new. The emissary offers to give Min a commission if he can bring a sample to the capital city, but Min confesses that he believes he is too old for such a trip. Tree-ear overhears the conversation between Min and the emissary. Tree-ear offers to take a sample of Min's work to Songdo for him, as a gift to Min's wife who has befriended and cared for Tree-ear over the past year. Once again, Min works quickly to create two melon-shaped vases with intricate, inlaid flowers along the side. Crane- man is hired to create a basket that will carry the vases without breaking them. After taking care to be sure Crane-man will be cared for during his absence, Tree-ear sets off alone for the capital city. Tree-ear walks for days alone, sleeping in the homes of strangers, or alone in the woods. When Tree- ear reaches the city of Puyo, he goes up to a mountain cliff where it is said a group of women jumped off to the river below to prevent capture by an invading army. At the top of this cliff, Tree-ear is attacked by two robbers who steal all his coins. The two robbers also take the vases and throw them over the edge of the cliff to the river below. After they have gone, Tree-ear rushes down to the river to check on the fate of the vases. Both vases are broken but one has broken in large pieces, allowing Tree-ear to take a single shard of the broken vase and continue his journey. When Tree-ear arrives in Songdo, he talks his way into a meeting with the emissary. Tree-ear reveals his attack by the robbers and then shows the single shard. Despite the incredulity of the emissary's assistant, Min is offered a commission and Tree- ear is given safe passage home on a ship. Once home, Tree-ear goes directly to the home of Min to tell him about the commission. Min has news for Tree-ear as well. Crane-man died a few days before when a farmer's cart broke the rotten bridge railing, causing him to fall into the cold water. Tree-ear is devastated by this news and afraid for his own future. However, Min's wife tells him that he is to move in with her and her husband. Later, Min reveals that he intends to teach Tree-ear, now known as Hyung-pil, the art of pottery.

It is typically used as a dip with bread or fresh vegetables for an hors d'≈ìuvre. Pre-made versions of duqqa can be bought in the spice markets of Cairo, where they are sold in paper cones, with the simplest version being crushed mint, salt, and pepper. The packaged variety that is found in markets is composed of parched wheat flour mixed with cumin and caraway. In the Hejaz region it has been part of the regional cuisine for decades. Etymology The word is derived from the Arabic for \\"to pound\\" since the mixture of spices and nuts is pounded together after being dry roasted to a texture that is neither powdered nor paste-like. The actual composition of the spice mix can vary from family to family, vendor to vendor though there are common ingredients, such as sesame, coriander, cumin, salt and black pepper. Reference to a 19th-century text lists marjoram, mint, zaatar and chickpeas as further ingredients that can be used in the mixture. A report from 1978 indicates that even further ingredients can be used, such as nigella, millet flour and dried cheese. Some modern variants include pine nuts, pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds. Internationally Duqqa is now becoming popular in some countries outside Egypt. In the United States it has gained exposure through such TV shows as Top Chef, Chopped and Iron Chef America. In Australia, several companies now make it in a variety of flavours. It has become popular in the past ten years, probably due to recent Lebanese and Arabic immigration as well as television cooking shows such as SBS Food Network.

Burghs of barony were distinct from royal burghs, as the title was granted to a landowner who, as a tenant-in-chief, held his estates directly from the crown. (In some cases, they might also be burghs of regality where the crown granted the leading noblemen judicial powers to try criminals for all offences except treason). They were created between 1450 and 1846, and conferred upon the landowner the right to hold weekly markets. Unlike royal burghs, they were not allowed to participate in foreign trade. In practice very few burghs of barony developed into market towns. Over 300 such burghs were created: the last was Ardrossan in 1846. From 1833 inhabitants of such burghs could form a police burgh governed by elected commissioners. In some cases the existing burgh continued to exist alongside the police burgh. Remaining burghs of barony were abolished in 1893 by the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892. Where a police burgh had been formed it absorbed the burgh of barony, in other cases the burgh was dissolved. From that date there was no practical difference between burghs of barony and other police burghs, though a distinction was still sometimes made. For instance, in 1957 Lord Lyon introduced distinctive \\"burghal coronets\\" to be displayed above the arms of burghs matriculated by his office: a \\"coronet suitable to a burgh of barony\\" was a red mural crown, whereas that for a police burgh was blue in colour.R M Urquhart, Scottish Burgh and County Heraldry, London 1973 All burghs were abolished in 1975 by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. However, feudal hereditary titles formally attached to the lands have been preserved, and are still recognized by the British crown today. Notes References * . * .

D. (December 26, 1878, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada - January 6, 1950, Baltimore, United States) was an American geographer and President of the Johns Hopkins University, 1935-1948. Biography Bowman was born in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. His family was Mennonite, and, at the age of eight weeks, Bowman‚Äôs father moved his family to a log cabin in Brown City, Michigan, sixty miles north of Detroit. In 1900, Isaiah became an American citizen and began intensive study to prepare himself for admittance to Harvard. Studying first at Michigan State Normal College in Ypsilanti (now Eastern Michigan University), Bowman came to the attention of Mark Jefferson, a geographer who had studied at Harvard under the most prominent geographer of the day, William Morris Davis. Jefferson recommended Bowman to Davis, smoothing the way for Bowman‚Äôs study. After one year, by prearrangement with Jefferson, Bowman returned to Michigan in 1903 for a year, before returning again to Harvard. After graduating from Harvard in 1905, he became an instructor and graduate student at Yale, where he stayed for ten years. While at Yale, Bowman participated in three study expeditions to South America, in 1907, 1911 and 1913; on the third trip, he served as the leader of the group. This research provided material for his PhD dissertation, conferred in 1909, and for several publications. In 1915, he became the first director of the American Geographical Society (AGS). Some of his more notable works include: *Forest Physiography (1911) *Well-Drilling Methods (1911) *South America (1915) *The Andes of Southern Peru (1916) *The New World-Problems in Political Geography (1921). Many reprints. *Desert Trails of Atacama (1924). *The Pioneer Fringe (1931) *Main Editor of Limits of Land Settlement (1937) When the United States entered the First World War in 1917, Bowman placed the resources of the AGS at the government's service, and he was asked to \\"gather and prepare data\\" to assist with a future peace conference once the fighting stopped. Bowman sailed for France in December 1918 as Chief Territorial Specialist, but he quickly assumed an administrative role as well, gaining the ear of President Woodrow Wilson and his chief adviser, Colonel Edward House. Bowman thus played a major role in determining distribution of land areas and national borders, especially in the Balkans, as part of the Paris Peace Conference. Bowman directed the American Geographical Society until 1935, when he was named the fifth president of the Johns Hopkins University, succeeding Joseph Sweetman Ames. Bowman inherited a growing deficit due to the Great Depression and he began working to reduce the deficit and build the university's endowment. By the late 1930s, Hopkins was back on stable financial ground. Continuing his government service, Bowman became a State Department adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Second World War, spending part of each week in Washington, DC, and leaving the running of the university in the hands of Provost P. Stewart Macaulay. In 1939 Roosevelt appointed Bowman to lead a search for an appropriate refuge for Jewish emigrants from Europe. Bowman's team looked for uninhabited or sparsely settled land on five continents, but not in the US. Bowman's opposition to accepting Jewish refugees stemmed from his deep antisemitism. At the Johns Hopkins University, he established an anti-Jewish admissions quota in 1945, when other leading universities were dismantling their Jewish quota systems, on grounds that Jews were an alien threat to American culture. In 1942, with Bowman‚Äôs strong encouragement, Hopkins founded a facility that became the Applied Physics Laboratory, where scientists perfected the Proximity fuze, a device that could explode an artillery shell near a target, rather than on contact or in a place where the target was predicted to be. This fuze aided greatly in repelling Japanese kamikaze attacks late in the war, and in the Ardennes region of Europe during the 1944 Battle of the Bulge. As a State Department adviser, Bowman participated in the Dumbarton Oaks Conference and the San Francisco Conference, playing a role in the foundation of the United Nations. Upon the conclusion of the Second World War, Bowman relinquished his State Department position and once again became a full-time university president. He presided over Hopkins‚Äô return to a peacetime status, planning for the influx of ex-military personnel as they returned to civilian status and resumed their education. His pet post-war project became the establishment of a school of geography at Johns Hopkins. As with many non-defense disciplines, geography had languished during the war years, and it became Bowman‚Äôs mission to build geography into a full-fledged division of the university. He was briefly successful, but the Isaiah Bowman School of Geography was never able to attract a high-profile scholar to give it the prestige it needed. Isaiah Bowman retired from the Hopkins presidency at the end of 1948, and died just over a year later. Shortly after his death, the School of Geography was downgraded to department status, and, by 1968, his name was removed from the department. In 1916 he became associate editor of the Geographical Review. He was associate editor of the Journal of Geography in 1918‚àí19 and editor in 1919‚àí20. In 1921 he became a director of the newly formed Council of Foreign Relations. Before and during World War II he served on the Council of Foreign Relations' War and Peace Studies project as chairman of its territorial group. From 1945 to 1949 he was a CFR vice-president. In 1941 he was awarded the British Royal Geographical Society's Patron's Gold Medal for his travels in South America and his services to Geography. Controversy Bowman was a known anti-Semite, extremely suspect of Jews and reluctant to hire them at the university. According to Neil Smith's \\"American Empire: Roosevelt's Geographer and the Prelude to Globalization\\" (University of California Press, 2004), Bowman fired one of the most promising young historians on the Johns Hopkins faculty in 1939, saying \\"there are already too many Jews at Hopkins.\\" In American Empire, Bowman is further quoted as saying \\"Jews don't come to Hopkins to make the world better or anything like that. They come for two things: to make money and to marry a non- Jewish woman.\\" In 1942, Bowman instituted a quota on the admission of Jewish students. Furthermore, while President of Johns Hopkins he was asked to look into the status of Geography at Harvard University, as a senior figure in the discipline. At the time Harvard had a Geology and Geography Department and was about to offer tenure to a second geographer, which was resisted by some geologists. Bowman's refusal to praise Harvard's geographers and their program, revealed through archival research by Neil Smith,Smith, Neil (2003). American Empire: Roosevelt's Geographer and the Prelude to Globalization. Berkeley: University of California Press. . was instrumental in Harvard's decision to close the program that year and almost end the teaching of geography at Harvard. Given Harvard's status, this had major repercussions across the country for the discipline. Archival research of private letters reveals Bowman intensely disliked the only tenured geography professor at Harvard, Derwent S. Whittlesey, for his scholarship and homosexuality.Smith, N. 1987. \\"Academic War over the Field of Geography\\": The Elimination of Geography at Harvard, 1947-1951. Annals of the Association of American Geographers. 77, 2, pp. 155-172 Bowman Expeditions Beginning in 2005, the American Geographical Society has helped launch international collaborative research projects, called the Bowman Expeditions in Bowman's honor, in part to advise the U.S. government concerning future trends in the human terrain of other countries. The first project, in Mexico, is called Mexico Indigena, and has generated considerable controversy, including a public statement from the Union of Organizations of the Sierra Juarez of Oaxaca (UNOSJO) denouncing Mexico Indigena's lack of full disclosure regarding funding procured from the DOD, via the U.S. Army's Foreign Military Services Office, Ft.

On leaving school, she went on in 1964 to pursue further studies at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. Quick was the first female president of the Oxford University Dramatic Society. Quick spent seven years researching a book about her paternal family's life in India, which was published in 2009 by Virago with the title A Tug on the Thread: From the British Raj to the British Stage. In her book Quick reveals that she is of mixed race (Anglo-Indian) descent. Her great-grandfather served 23 years in the army in India before becoming a policeman and her great- grandmother had to flee from the Indian Rebellion of 1857 after her father was killed. Career Quick is perhaps best known for the role of Lady Julia Flyte in the television production of Brideshead Revisited. She received an Emmy and British Academy Television Awards nomination for her work. Quick has also appeared in many theatre, film and television productions. Her stage work has included roles in Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida to Brecht's The Threepenny Opera.

Life She was a younger daughter of Count Favorino Scifi. Her birth name was probably Caterina; she took the name of Agnes when she became a nun. Her mother, Ortolana, who also would join the Order founded by her daughters, belonged to the noble family of the Fiumi. Their cousin Rufino was one of the original \\"Three Companions\\" of Francis of Assisi.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 6 January 2020 On 18 March 1212, her eldest sister Clare, inspired by the example of St. Francis of Assisi, left their father's home in secret to become a follower of the saint. Sixteen days later, Agnes ran off to the Church of St. Angelo di Panzo where St. Francis had brought her sister, resolved to share Clare's life of poverty and penance.Arnald of Sarrant. Chronicle of the Twenty-Four Generals of the Order of Friars Minor, (Noel Muscat ofm, trans.) Ordo Fratrum Minorum. Malta, 2010 Angry at having lost two of his daughters, their father sent his brother Monaldo, and several relations and armed followers to the monastery to force Agnes, if persuasion failed, to return home. Arrival of Saint Agnes of Assisi at the Convent, Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Bernardes, 1697 Monaldo drew his sword to strike his niece, but his arm allegedly dropped to his side, withered and useless. The others dragged Agnes out of the monastery by her hair, striking her and kicking her repeatedly. Agnes' body reportedly became so heavy, perhaps due to the help of her sister, that her assailants dropped her in a field nearby. Agnes' relatives, purportedly realizing that something divine protected her, allowed the sisters to remain together. Saint Francis himself cut her hair and gave her the religious habit, in recognition of Agnes' dedication. Francis later established a cloister for Clare and Agnes at the rural chapel of San Damiano, where they were soon joined by other noble women of the city, and the Order of Poor Ladies, later known as the Poor Clares, began, with Clare as its abbess. In 1221, a group of Benedictine nuns in Monticelli near Florence asked to become Poor Ladies. Agnes was chosen to lead the new community.Foley O.F.M., Leonard. \\"St. Agnes of Assisi\\", Saint of the Day, Franciscan Media Although life in the Florentine convent was harmonious and without faction, she missed her sister greatly. She later went on to establish other communities of the Order, including those of Mantua, Venice, and Padua. Agnes was said to be very virtuous, and as abbess she ruled with a benevolent kindness, knowing how to make the practice of virtue appealing to her Sisters. In 1253, Agnes returned to Assisi to nurse her sister Clare during the latter's illness, and shortly thereafter died herself, on 16 November 1253.\\"Agnes of Assisi\\", SAints Resource, RCL Benziger Her remains were interred with those of her sister at the Basilica of St. Clare at Assisi.Monks of Ramsgate. ‚ÄúAgnes of Assisi‚Äù.

OOAD in modern software engineering is typically conducted in an iterative and incremental way. The outputs of OOAD activities are analysis models (for OOA) and design models (for OOD) respectively. The intention is for these to be continuously refined and evolved, driven by key factors like risks and business value. History  In the early days of object-oriented technology before the mid-1990s, there were many different competing methodologies for software development and object-oriented modeling, often tied to specific Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool vendors. No standard notations, consistent terms and process guides were the major concerns at the time, which degraded communication efficiency and lengthened learning curves. Some of the well-known early object-oriented methodologies were from and inspired by gurus such as Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson (the Three Amigos), Robert Martin, Peter Coad, Sally Shlaer, Stephen Mellor, and Rebecca Wirfs-Brock. In 1994, the Three Amigos of Rational Software started working together to develop the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Later, together with Philippe Kruchten and Walker Royce (eldest son of Winston Royce), they have led a successful mission to merge their own methodologies, OMT, OOSE and Booch method, with various insights and experiences from other industry leaders into the Rational Unified Process (RUP), a comprehensive iterative and incremental process guide and framework for learning industry best practices of software development and project management. Since then, the Unified Process family has become probably the most popular methodology and reference model for object-oriented analysis and design. Overview The software life cycle is typically divided up into stages going from abstract descriptions of the problem to designs then to code and testing and finally to deployment. The earliest stages of this process are analysis and design. The analysis phase is also often called \\"requirements acquisition\\". The Waterfall Model. OOAD is conducted in an iterative and incremental manner, as formulated by the Unified Process. In some approaches to software development‚Äîknown collectively as waterfall models‚Äîthe boundaries between each stage are meant to be fairly rigid and sequential. The term \\"waterfall\\" was coined for such methodologies to signify that progress went sequentially in one direction only, i.e., once analysis was complete then and only then was design begun and it was rare (and considered a source of error) when a design issue required a change in the analysis model or when a coding issue required a change in design. The alternative to waterfall models are iterative models. This distinction was popularized by Barry Boehm in a very influential paper on his Spiral Model for iterative software development. With iterative models it is possible to do work in various stages of the model in parallel. So for example it is possible‚Äîand not seen as a source of error‚Äîto work on analysis, design, and even code all on the same day and to have issues from one stage impact issues from another. The emphasis on iterative models is that software development is a knowledge-intensive process and that things like analysis can't really be completely understood without understanding design issues, that coding issues can affect design, that testing can yield information about how the code or even the design should be modified, etc.Boehm B, \\"A Spiral Model of Software Development and Enhancement\\", IEEE Computer, IEEE, 21(5):61-72, May 1988 Although it is possible to do object- oriented development using a waterfall model, in practice most object-oriented systems are developed with an iterative approach. As a result, in object- oriented processes \\"analysis and design\\" are often considered at the same time. The object-oriented paradigm emphasizes modularity and re-usability. The goal of an object-oriented approach is to satisfy the \\"open closed principle\\". A module is open if it supports extension, or if the module provides standardized ways to add new behaviors or describe new states. In the object- oriented paradigm this is often accomplished by creating a new subclass of an existing class. A module is closed if it has a well defined stable interface that all other modules must use and that limits the interaction and potential errors that can be introduced into one module by changes in another. In the object-oriented paradigm this is accomplished by defining methods that invoke services on objects. Methods can be either public or private, i.e., certain behaviors that are unique to the object are not exposed to other objects. This reduces a source of many common errors in computer programming. The software life cycle is typically divided up into stages going from abstract descriptions of the problem to designs then to code and testing and finally to deployment. The earliest stages of this process are analysis and design. The distinction between analysis and design is often described as \\"what vs. how\\". In analysis developers work with users and domain experts to define what the system is supposed to do. Implementation details are supposed to be mostly or totally (depending on the particular method) ignored at this phase. The goal of the analysis phase is to create a functional model of the system regardless of constraints such as appropriate technology. In object-oriented analysis this is typically done via use cases and abstract definitions of the most important objects. The subsequent design phase refines the analysis model and makes the needed technology and other implementation choices. In object- oriented design the emphasis is on describing the various objects, their data, behavior, and interactions. The design model should have all the details required so that programmers can implement the design in code.. Object- oriented analysis The purpose of any analysis activity in the software life- cycle is to create a model of the system's functional requirements that is independent of implementation constraints. The main difference between object- oriented analysis and other forms of analysis is that by the object-oriented approach we organize requirements around objects, which integrate both behaviors (processes) and states (data) modeled after real world objects that the system interacts with. In other or traditional analysis methodologies, the two aspects: processes and data are considered separately. For example, data may be modeled by ER diagrams, and behaviors by flow charts or structure charts. Common models used in OOA are use cases and object models. Use cases describe scenarios for standard domain functions that the system must accomplish. Object models describe the names, class relations (e.g. Circle is a subclass of Shape), operations, and properties of the main objects. User- interface mockups or prototypes can also be created to help understanding. During object-oriented design (OOD), a developer applies implementation constraints to the conceptual model produced in object-oriented analysis. Such constraints could include the hardware and software platforms, the performance requirements, persistent storage and transaction, usability of the system, and limitations imposed by budgets and time. Concepts in the analysis model which is technology independent, are mapped onto implementing classes and interfaces resulting in a model of the solution domain, i.e., a detailed description of how the system is to be built on concrete technologies. Important topics during OOD also include the design of software architectures by applying architectural patterns and design patterns with object-oriented design principles. Object-oriented modeling Object-oriented modeling (OOM) is a common approach to modeling applications, systems, and business domains by using the object-oriented paradigm throughout the entire development life cycles. OOM is a main technique heavily used by both OOD and OOA activities in modern software engineering. Object-oriented modeling typically divides into two aspects of work: the modeling of dynamic behaviors like business processes and use cases, and the modeling of static structures like classes and components. OOA and OOD are the two distinct abstract levels (i.e. the analysis level and the design level) during OOM. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) and SysML are the two popular international standard languages used for object-oriented modeling. The benefits of OOM are: Efficient and effective communication Users typically have difficulties in understanding comprehensive documents and programming language codes well. Visual model diagrams can be more understandable and can allow users and stakeholders to give developers feedback on the appropriate requirements and structure of the system. A key goal of the object-oriented approach is to decrease the \\"semantic gap\\" between the system and the real world, and to have the system be constructed using terminology that is almost the same as the stakeholders use in everyday business. Object-oriented modeling is an essential tool to facilitate this. Useful and stable abstraction Modeling helps coding. A goal of most modern software methodologies is to first address \\"what\\" questions and then address \\"how\\" questions, i.e. first determine the functionality the system is to provide without consideration of implementation constraints, and then consider how to make specific solutions to these abstract requirements, and refine them into detailed designs and codes by constraints such as technology and budget. Object-oriented modeling enables this by producing abstract and accessible descriptions of both system requirements and designs, i.e. models that define their essential structures and behaviors like processes and objects, which are important and valuable development assets with higher abstraction levels above concrete and complex source code.

The efforts of the Office of Censorship to balance the protection of sensitive war related information with the constitutional freedoms of the press is considered largely successful. The agency's implementation of censorship was done primarily through a voluntary regulatory code that was willingly adopted by the press. The phrase \\"loose lips sink ships\\" was popularized during World War II, which is a testament to the urgency Americans felt to protect information relating to the war effort. Radio broadcasts, newspapers, and newsreels were the primary ways Americans received their information about World War II and therefore were the medium most affected by the Office of Censorship code. The closure of the Office of Censorship in November 1945 corresponded with the ending of World War II. History Employee pin of World War II US War Service, Office of Censorship. The words on the shield in the center read Silentium Victoriam Accelerat (Latin: \\"Silence Speeds Victory,\\" the motto of the Office) = Immediate predecessors = Censorship by the American press began on a voluntary basis before America's official entry into World War II. In 1939, after the war had already begun in Europe, journalists in America started withholding information about Canadian troop movements.Sweeney, Michael S. (2001). Secrets of Victory: The Office of Censorship and the American Press and Radio in World War II. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. In September 1939, President Roosevelt declared a state of national emergency. In response to the threat of war, branches in the United States government that explicitly regulated censorship popped up within the Military and Navy. These branches were the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, which began in September 1939, and the Censorship Branch in the Military Intelligence Division which formed in June 1941. A Joint Board was also established in September 1939 to facilitate censorship planning between the Military and Navy departments of the US government. The bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 caused the official entry of America into World War II and the reorganizing of government activities responsible for censoring communication in and out of the United States. The First War Powers Act, passed on December 18, 1941, contained broad grants of Executive authority, including a provision on censorship. = Executive Order 8985 = On December 19, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8985, which established the Office of Censorship and conferred on its director the power to censor international communications in \\"his absolute discretion.\\" The order set up a Censorship Policy Board to advise the director on policy coordination and integration of censorship activities. It also authorized the director to establish a Censorship Operating Board that would bring together other government agencies to deal with issues of communication interception. By March 15, 1942, all military personnel who had been working on the Joint Board or on operations at the direction of the Joint Board were moved into the Office of Censorship. = The Director of Censorship = Byron Price, who was the executive news editor at the Associated Press, accepted the position of Director of Censorship on 19 December 1941 under the conditions that he would report directly to Roosevelt and that the president agreed with his desire to continue voluntary censorship. Throughout Price's tenure, the responsibility for censorship in the media was entirely on journalists. His motto for convincing the media to comply was, \\"Least said, soonest mended.\\" Although over 30 agencies in the US government at the time of World War II had some censorship role, the foundation of government policies relied heavily on the patriotism and voluntary cooperation of news establishments. The American Civil Liberties Union said that Price had \\"censored the press and made them like it.\\" Price advocated against decentralizing the Office of Censorship and prevented it from merging with the Office of War Information. Price believed that a merger with the Office of War Information (OWI) would prevent the public from receiving truthful information with regards to war time efforts. While OWI and the Office of Censorship, both primarily dealt with censoring information related to the war, the OWI was also involved in political propaganda campaigns. Though the official closure of the Office of Censorship did not come until November 1945, one day following the August 14th, 1945 Japanese surrender, Price hung a sign outside of his office door that read \\"out of business.\\" In January 1946, then President Harry Truman praised Price's work at the agency and awarded Price the Medal for Merit, which was at the time the highest decoration that could be awarded to an American civilian. = Activities = To effect closer coordination of censorship activities during the war effort, representatives of Great Britain, Canada, and the United States signed an agreement providing for the complete exchange of information among all concerned parties. They also created a central clearinghouse of information within the headquarters of the Office of Censorship. Price utilized existing facilities of the War Department and Navy Department wherever possible. On March 15, 1942, Army and Navy personnel engaged in censorship activities moved from the War Department and Navy Department to the Office of Censorship. There they monitored the 350,000 overseas cables and telegrams and 25,000 international telephone calls each week. Offices in Los Angeles, New York City, and Rochester, New York reviewed films.Kennett, Lee (1985). For the duration... : the United States goes to war, Pearl Harbor-1942. New York: Scribner. . Radio was especially vulnerable to government control under the Communications Act of 1934. The voluntary nature of censorship relieved many broadcasters, which had expected that war would cause the government to seize all stations and draft their employees into the army. Such authority existed; Attorney General Francis Biddle issued an opinion to Price in early 1942 that gave him almost unlimited authority over broadcasting. As an experienced journalist who disliked having to act as censor, he feared that a nationwide takeover of radio would result in a permanent government monopoly. Price believed that voluntary cooperation must be tried first with mandatory censorship only if necessary, and persuaded other government officials and the military to agree. = End of the agency = As the military situation improved, plans for adjustment and eventual cessation of censorship were devised. Executive Order 9631 issued the formal cessation of the Office of Censorship on September 28, 1945. The order became effective on November 15, 1945. Price thanked journalists nationwide for their cooperation: \\"You deserve, and you have, the thanks and appreciation of your Government. And my own gratitude and that of my colleagues in the unpleasant task of administering censorship is beyond words or limit.\\" In a postwar memo to President Harry Truman on future wartime censorship procedures, Price wrote that \\"no one who does not dislike censorship should ever be permitted to exercise censorship\\" and urged that voluntary cooperation be again used.  The Code of Wartime Practices for the American Press  The Code of Wartime Practices for the American Press was first issued on January 15, 1942 by the Office of Censorship. It had subsequent versions released on June 15, 1942 and on May 15, 1945 post-victory in Europe. The code set forth in simple terms‚Äîonly seven pages for broadcasters, and five for the printed press‚Äîsubjects that contained information of value to the enemy and which, therefore, should not be published or broadcast in the United States without authorization by a qualified government source. Price promised that \\"what does not concern the war does not concern censorship.\\" Rather than having government officials review all articles and columns, the newspapers and radio stations voluntarily adopted to seek approval from a relevant government agency before discussing information on sensitive subjects. These sensitive subjects included factory production figures, troop movements, damages to American forces, and weather reports. All major news organizations in addition to 1,600 accredited wartime correspondents pledged to adhere to the code. A 24-hour hotline quickly answered media questions on appropriate topics. A 1943 Works Progress Administration poster suggesting that careless communication may be harmful to the war effort. It depicts a letter from a soldier stamped \\"examined by 42.\\" =\\"Man in the street\\"= There was no government mandate to publish or broadcast positive news, unlike the Committee on Public Information during World War I. Complying with the code ended popular media features, however. Radio stations had to discontinue programs with audience participation and man on the street interviews because of the risk that an enemy agent might use the microphone. Similarly, lost-and-found advertisements ended and All Request programs were asked to avoid complying with specific times for music requests, in both cases to prevent encoded transmission of secret data. Stations cooperated despite losing the advertising revenue from sponsors; Price later estimated that losing man on the street programs alone cost stations \\"tens of millions of dollars\\" during the war, although the increase in war-related advertisements more than compensated. =Weather= The Office of Censorship and the Weather Bureau saw weather as especially sensitive. Military authorities asked the Office of Censorship to severely limit information about the weather because they feared too much information would help the enemy attack. Weather-related news comprised about half of all code violations. While newspapers could print temperature tables and regular bureau forecasts, the code asked radio stations to only use specially approved bureau forecasts to prevent enemy submarines from learning of current conditions. From January 15, 1942 to October 12, 1943 broadcasters said nothing about rain, snow, fog, wind, air pressure, temperature, or sunshine unless it was approved by the Weather Bureau. After Memphis, Tennessee stations could not discuss tornadoes that killed hundreds in March 1942, the code was changed to permit emergency bulletins but only if approved by the office. The office saw current weather conditions as so sensitive that it considered banning broadcasting any outdoor sports event, but decided that sport's benefit to morale was too important. When fog so covered a Chicago football game in August 1942 that the radio play-by-play announcer could not see the field, the Weather Bureau thanked him for never using the word \\"fog\\" or mentioning the weather. In 1942, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote a newspaper column about her travel across the country, in which she described the weather. She received \\"a very stern letter\\" from the Office of Censorship reprimanding her. =Presidential travel= The code specifically restricted information on \\"movements of the President of the United States\\". As Price reported only to the President, Roosevelt effectively became censor of all news about himself. When he toured war factories around the country for two weeks in September 1942, for example, only three wire service reporters accompanied him on the private railroad car Ferdinand Magellan. They filed articles for later publication, and despite being seen by tens of thousands of Americans, almost no mention appeared in the press of the president's trip until after it ended. Similar procedures were used on later domestic and international trips, such as to Casablanca in 1943 and Yalta in 1945. While the majority of reporters supported voluntarily censoring themselves over such travel, Roosevelt also used the code to hide frequent weekend trips to Springwood Estate and, some believed, the meetings with former lover Lucy Rutherford that began again in 1944. During the 1944 presidential election, he may have used his ability to avoid press reports to hide evidence of worsening health. Such arbitrary use of the code was controversial among Washington reporters, and Price privately wrote that Roosevelt \\"greatly abused\\" the press' cooperation. =Restrictions= Price stated throughout the war that he wanted censorship to end as soon as possible. The code of conduct was relaxed in October 1943 to permit weather information except barometric pressure and wind direction, and weather programs returned to radio. Most restrictions ended after V-E Day in May 1945, with the code only four pages in length after its final revision.

It and radar were the two military topics that, if a code violation occurred, his office did not allow this to be used as a precedent for permitting other media outlets to report the same information. The government made a general announcement on radar in April 1943, and government and military officials frequently leaked information on the subject, but restrictions did not end until the day after Japan's surrender in August 1945. From mid-1943 until the bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945, the Office of Censorship helped keep the Manhattan Project secret by asking the press and broadcasters to voluntarily censor information they learned about atomic energy or the project. Perhaps the worst press violation occurred in August 1944, when due to procedural errors a nationwide Mutual Network broadcast mentioned the military creating a weapon in Pasco, Washington involving atom splitting. The Office of Censorship asked all recordings of the broadcast to be destroyed. As with radar, officials sometimes disclosed information to the press without authorization. That was not the first request for voluntary censorship of atomic-related information. Price noted in comments to reporters after the end of censorship that some 20,000 news outlets had been delivered similar requests. For the most part censors were able to keep sensitive information about the Manhattan Project from being published or broadcast. Slips of the tongue occurred with individuals knowledgeable about the project. Another serious breach of secrecy occurred in March 1944, when John Raper of the Cleveland Press published \\"Forbidden City\\". The reporter, who had heard rumors while vacationing in New Mexico, described a secret project in Los Alamos, calling it \\"Uncle Sam's mystery town directed by '2nd Einstein'\\", J. Robert Oppenheimer. It speculated that the project was working on chemical warfare, powerful new explosives, or a beam that would cause German aircraft engines to fail. Manhattan Project leaders called the article \\"a complete lack of responsibility, compliance with national censorship code and cooperation with the Government in keeping an important project secret\\", and considered drafting Raper into the military, but the article apparently did not cause Axis spies to investigate the project. After Hiroshima The New York Times was first to report on the specifics of the Manhattan Project on August 7, 1945, saying the bomb was built in \\"three 'hidden cities' with a total population of 100,000 inhabitants\\"; Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington. \\"None of the people, who came to these developments from homes all the way from Maine to California, had the slightest idea of what they were making in the gigantic Government plants they saw around them,\\" the New York Times said.

Life Einar Kvaran was the son of Rev. Hj√∂rleifur Einarsson and Gu√∞laug Eyj√≥lfsd√≥ttir. His name was originally Einar Hjorleifsson but he adopted the family name Kvaran in 1916 along with his brothers Sigurdur and Trygvi and the sons of his deceased brother Joseph. (The name is taken from Laxd√¶la saga. In 1913, the Althing passed a law, since rescinded, which permitted Icelanders to adopt family names. Einar Hj√∂rleifsson was on a committee that proposed to allow certain categories of names, including those with ancient origins.William H. Swatos and Loftur Reimar Gissurarson, Icelandic Spiritualism: Mediumship and Modernity in Iceland, New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction, 1997, , p. 77, note 23.) Einar graduated in 1881 from the College of Iceland, known as the Latin School.Stef√°n Einarsson, A History of Icelandic Literature, New York: Johns Hopkins for the American Scandinavian Foundation, 1957, OCLC 264046441, p. 262.Richard Beck, ed., Icelandic Lyrics: Originals and Translations, Thorhallur Bjarnarson, Reykjav√≠k: Bjarnarson, 1930, OCLC 2067368, p. 137. As a student in economics at the University of Copenhagen in 1882, he was one of four students to publish the single issue of the literary periodical Ver√∞andi, which introduced to Iceland the Modern Breakthrough expounded by Georg Brandes.√ûorleifur Hauksson, \\"Nordic language history and literary history IV: Iceland\\" in The Nordic Languages: an International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages, ed. Oskar Bandle et al., Volume 1 Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 2002, , 470-82, pp. 475-76. Einar was one of the pioneers of realism in Icelandic writing; his stories and novels represent a break with past admiration of the sagas: they are written in educated contemporary language and deal with ordinary people and problems.√ûorleifur Hauksson, p. 476. From 1885 to 1895 Einar emigrated to Icelandic Canada,Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature, ed. Jean Albert B√©d√©, William Benbow Edgerton, 2nd ed. New York: Columbia, 1980, , p. 454. where he lived in Winnipeg and helped found two Icelandic-language weekly publications, Heimskringla (\\"Globe\\") and L√∂gberg (\\"Tribune\\").Daisy L. Neijmann, A History of Icelandic Literature, Histories of Scandinavian Literature 5, Lincoln: University of Nebraska with the American-Scandinavian Foundation, 2006, , p. 321.Swatos, Loftur Gissurarson, p. 57. On his return to Iceland he was a journalist and editor in both Reykjav√≠k and Akureyri; he participated in the struggle for independence and also wrote about education, temperance and theatre. He was co-editor of √çsafold, then Iceland's leading newspaper, and editor of Fjallkonan.Swatos, Loftur Gissurarson, p. 58. He edited Sk√≠rnir, the journal of the Icelandic Literary Society, from 1892 to 1895 and from 1908 to 1909. Einar wrote numerous short stories, novels, plays, and a volume of early poems. His breakthrough work was the story \\"Vonir\\" (\\"Hopes\\"), which he wrote in 1890 while in Canada and which deals with the emigrant experience. In 1906 the Government of Iceland granted him a stipend to enable him to devote himself entirely to writing.Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature, p. 454. Einar was also a prominent Spiritualist, author of the first positive assessment of spiritualism in IcelandicSwatos, Loftur Gissurarson, p. 82. and co-founder and President of the Experimental Society which gave rise to the Icelandic Society for Psychical Research (S√°larranns√≥knarf√©lag √çslands), of which he was the first president.Swatos, Loftur Gissurarson, pp. 84-85, 223. He played a major part in the investigation and publicising of many Icelandic mediums, notably Indri√∞i Indri√∞ason and Hafstein Bj√∂rnsson.Swatos, Loftur Gissurarson, pp. 83-154, 219; p. 214: \\"Einar Kvaran had sittings in his home with [Miss Bj√∂rg Hafsteen], as with other mediums in this period [the early 1930s]\\". His later writings were dominated by spiritualism,Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature p. 380.According to Stef√°n Einarsson, p. 263, beginning with the novel S√°lin vaknar (\\"The Soul Awakens,\\" 1916). particularly the novel S√∂gur Rannveigar (\\"Rannveig's Tales\\", parts I and II 1919 and 1922),Neijmann,p. 323. but also by Christian humanism.Neijmann, p. 322. He influenced Icelanders to be less rigidly orthodox and to be less harsh in rearing their children.Neijmann, p. 322, quoting Steingr√≠mur J. √ûorsteinsson. In the 1920s, there was a rumour that Kvaran was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in response Sigur√∞ur Nordal disparaged him as overly focused on forgiveness and thus tolerant of things that should rather be opposed; in the spirit of Icelandic nationalism and contemporary interpretations of Nietzsche, he considered the blood feud a better ethical model.Nijmann, pp. 366-67. In the 1930s Halld√≥r Laxness criticised him more sharply yet for his spiritualism.Stef√°n Einarsson, p. 264. Personal life Einar was married twice. His first wife, Mathilde Petersen, was Danish; she died in Canada, and their two children both died in infancy. In 1888 he married G√≠sl√≠na G√≠slad√≥ttir. They had five children; the eldest, Sigur√∞ur, died of tuberculosis when he was 15. References Sources * Richard Beck. Einar H. Kvaran, an Icelandic Novelist and Dramatist.

She is honored as a saint by the Catholic Church. Life Agnes was born in 1268 into the noble Segni family in Gracciano, a frazione of Montepulciano, then part of the Papal States. At the age of nine, she convinced her parents to allow her to enter a Franciscan monastery of women in the city known as the \\"Sisters of the Sack\\", after the rough religious habit they wore. They lived a simple, contemplative life. She received the permission of the pope to be accepted into this life at such a young age, which was normally against Church law. In 1281, the lord of the castle of Proceno, a fief of Orvieto, invited the nuns of Montepulciano to send some of their sisters to Proceno to found a new monastery. Agnes was among the nuns sent to found this new community. At the age of fourteen she was appointed bursar. In 1288 Agnes, despite her youth at only 20 years of age, was noted for her devotion to the Blessed Sacrament and deep life of prayer, and was elected as the abbess of the community. There she gained a reputation for performing miracles; people suffering from mental and physical ailments seemed cured by her presence. She was reported to have \\"multiplied loaves\\", creating many from a few on numerous occasions, recalling the Gospel miracle of the loaves and fishes. She herself, however, suffered severe bouts of illness which lasted long periods of time. In 1306, Agnes was recalled to head the monastery in Montepulciano. Agnes reached a high degree of contemplative prayer and is said to have been favored with many visions. After her return, she proceeded to build a church, Santa Maria Novella in Florence, to honor the Blessed Mother, as she felt she had been commanded to do in a mystical vision several years earlier. She also had a vision of Dominic Guzman, under the inspiration of which she led the nuns of her monastery to embrace the Rule of St. Augustine as members of the Dominican Order. She was frequently called upon to bring peace to the warring families of the city. By 1316, Agnes' health had declined so greatly that her doctor suggested taking the cure at the thermal springs in the neighboring town of Chianciano Terme. The nuns of the community prevailed upon her to take his recommendation. While many of the other bathers reported being cured of their illnesses, Agnes herself received no benefit from the springs. Her health failed to such a degree that she had to be carried back to the monastery on a stretcher. Veneration Agnes died the following 20 April, at the age of 49. The Dominican friars attempted to obtain balsam (or myrrh) to embalm her body. It was found, however, to be producing a sweet odor on its own, and her limbs remained supple. When her body was moved years after her death to the monastery church, it was found to be incorrupt. Her tomb became the site of pilgrimages. Some fifty years later, a Dominican friar, Raymond of Capua, who served as confessor to Catherine of Siena, wrote an account of Agnes' life. He described her body as still appearing as if she were alive. Catherine herself referred to her as \\"Our mother, the glorious Agnes\\". Catherine made a pilgrimage to Montepulciano while visiting her niece, Eugenie, who was a nun there. Agnes was canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726. Her feast day is celebrated within the Dominican Order on 20 April.

Flook, 437 U.S. 584 (1978), was a 1978 United States Supreme Court decision that ruled that an invention that departs from the prior art only in its use of a mathematical algorithm is patent eligible only if there is some other \\"inventive concept in its application.\\". The algorithm itself must be considered as if it were part of the prior art, and the claim must be considered as a whole. The case was argued on April 25, 1978 and was decided June 22, 1978. This case is the second member of the Supreme Court's patent- eligibility trilogy. The other two cases were: , and . Prior history The case revolves around a patent application for a \\"Method for Updating Alarm Limits\\". These limits are numbers between which a catalytic converter is operating normally. The numbers are determined by taking a time-weighted average of values of a relevant operating parameter, such as temperature inside the reactor, in accordance with a smoothing algorithm.For an explanation of the mathematics and a graph illustrating a similar algorithm see Engineering Statistics Handbook, U.S. Dept. of Commerce. When the values of these numbers leave this range an alarm may be sounded. The claims, however, were directed to the numbers (the \\"alarm limits\\") themselves. Flook's method was identical to previous systems except for the mathematical algorithm. In fact, although the patent examiner assumed that Flook had originated the mathematical technique, someone else had published it a number of years earlier.Robert G. Brown is credited with the \\"invention\\" of this \\"smoothing\\" technique, which is described. among other places, in Robert G. Brown, Smoothing, Forecasting, and Prediction of Discrete Time Series (1963). Another source states that the technique of exponential smoothing was first suggested by C.C. Holt in 1957. Flook's application, Ser. No. 194,032, was filed October 29, 1971, eight years after Brown and fourteen years after Holt. In Gottschalk v. Benson, the court had ruled that the discovery of a new formula is not patentable. This case differed from Benson by including a specific application‚Äîcatalytic conversion of hydrocarbons‚Äîfor the formula as a claim limitation (a so-called field of use limitation). The patent examiner rejected the patent application as \\"in practical effect\\" a claim to the formula or its mathematics. When the decision was appealed, the Board of Appeals of the Patent and Trademark Office sustained the examiner's rejection. Next, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA) reversed the Board's decision, saying that the patent only claimed the right to the equation in the limited context of the catalytic chemical conversion of hydrocarbons, so that the patent would not wholly pre-empt the use of the algorithm. Finally, the Government, on behalf of the (Acting) Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the CCPA in the Supreme Court. Supreme Court's decision The law which is applicable to this case is section 101 of the Patent Act.Section 101 says, \\"Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\\" Section 100(b) gives the definition for process, \\"The term ‚Äòprocess‚Äô means process, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.\\" . If Flook's patent claim can meet the definition of a \\"process\\" under that law then it is patent-eligible (that is, it is the kind of thing that can receive a patent if it is also novel, unobvious, and the like). The Court decided that the patent claim under review was instead a claim to a \\"principle\\" or a \\"law of nature\\" and thus not patent-eligible. The Court relied on a line of cases following from the Neilson blast furnace case.Neilson v. Harford, 151 Eng. Rep. 1266, 8 M. & W. 806, Web. Pat. Cas. 273 (1844). An excerpted version is available at Geo. Wash. L.S. The principle of that case, as explained in O'Reilly v. Morse,. is that that patent-eligibility must be analyzed on the basis of it being as if the principle, algorithm, or mathematical formula were already well known (was in the prior art). Flook's process is thus ineligible for a patent \\"because, once that algorithm is assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contains no patentable invention.\\" In a nutshell: > Even though a phenomenon of nature or mathematical formula may be well > known, an inventive application of the principle may be patented. > Conversely, the discovery of such a phenomenon cannot support a patent > unless there is some other inventive concept in its application. [Emphasis > supplied.]The same legal principle was determinative in Funk Brothers Seed > Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., where the inventor had discovered that certain > species of leguminous bacteria did not inactivate one another, as most did, > and he proceeded to exploit this phenomenon of nature by providing a package > containing a mixture of the particular bacterial species. Because the Court > considered this implementation trivial on its face, it held that the patent > was no different from one on the phenomenon itself, which was impermissible. > Flook therefore applied to a process the legal principle that Funk applied > to an article of manufacture or composition. The Court did not agree with Flook's assertion that the existence of a limitation to a specific field of use made the formula patent-eligible. The majority opinion said of this argument: > A competent draftsman could attach some form of post-solution activity to > almost any mathematical formula; the Pythagorean theorem would not have been > patentable, or partially patentable, because a patent application contained > a final step indicating that the formula, when solved, could be usefully > applied to existing surveying techniques. The court moderated that assertion by agreeing that not all patent applications involving formulas are patent-ineligible by saying, \\"Yet it is equally clear that a process is not unpatentable simply because it contains a law of nature or a mathematical algorithm.\\" Patents involving formulas, laws of nature, or abstract principles are eligible for patent protection if the implementation of the principle is novel and unobvious‚Äîunlike this case, in which it was conceded that the implementation was conventional.The patent examiner so found and Flook did not contest the ruling. Accordingly, in Flook's case, there was no \\"other inventive concept in its application\\", and thus no eligibility for a patent. Criticism and response to Flook In In re Bergy, a 1979 decision of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (C.C.P.A.), Judge Giles Rich extensively criticized Justice Stevens's Flook opinion. The Supreme Court had vacated an earlier Bergy opinion,In re Bergy, 563 F.2d 1031 (C.C.P.A. 1977), vacated sub nom. . with terse instructions that the CCPA should give the matter \\"further consideration in light of Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584 (1978).\\" Judge Rich began by protesting that \\"[t]he Court gave no intimation of what bearing it thought Flook has on the single issue in these appeals [whether the claimed subject matter was patent-eligible], except as it may be gleaned from the Flook opinion.\\" After an exhaustive analysis of what Flook, the Constitution, and the patent statute provide about the grant of patents--which said little or nothing about the patent-ineligibility of abstract ideas and how section 101 of the patent law relates to that--Judge Rich summarized his view: \\"To conclude on the light Flook sheds on these cases, very simply, for the reasons we have stated, we find none.\\" Before reaching his conclusion, however, Judge Rich condemned the Flook opinion as embodying: > an unfortunate and apparently unconscious, though clear, commingling of > distinct statutory provisions which are conceptually unrelated, namely, > those pertaining to the categories of inventions in ¬ß 101 which may be > patentable and to the conditions for patentability demanded by the statute > for inventions within the statutory categories, particularly the > nonobviousness condition of ¬ß 103. The reason for this confusion in the Court's opinion he attributed to \\"subversive nonsense\\" in the government's briefs for the Patent Office: > We have observed with regret that the briefs filed by the Solicitor General > for Acting Commissioner Parker in Parker v. Flook, a case which, as the > Court noted, \\"turns entirely on the proper construction of ¬ß 101,\\" badly, > and with a seeming sense of purpose, confuse the statutory-categories > requirement of ¬ß 101 with a requirement for the existence of \\"invention.\\" > This they do by basing argument on the opening words of ¬ß 101, \\"Whoever > invents or discovers,\\" thereby importing into the discussion of compliance > with ¬ß 101 a requirement for \\"invention\\" in a patentability sense. To Judge Rich, even though section 101 says \\"whoever invents or discovers,\\" there is no basis for importing into the analysis any inquiry into the nature of what it is that the patent applicants purports to have invented, and whether it is the kind of thing that can be patented as an invention. Thus, when the Flook Court says that Flook's process is not the kind of process that the patent law permits to be patented, even though it is a process in the ordinary dictionary sense of the word, Judge Rich finds the inquiry impermissible because \\"¬ß 101 was never intended to be a 'standard of patentability'; the standards, or conditions as the statute calls them, are in ¬ß 102 and ¬ß 103.\\" The only legitimate question, he says, is whether the claimed subject matter is \\"new, useful, and unobvious.\\"This ignores the admonition in Graham that the words of the patent statute must be read and interpreted in the light of the words of the Constitution and the purpose of the patent clause. In 2011 the Federal Circuit remarked in passing: \\"We note that Bergy is no longer binding law.\\" Judge Rich could not agree that the implementation of a natural principle must be \\"inventive\\" rather than concededly conventional (as Flook had conceded). To him, that improperly mixed obviousness under section 103 up with statutory subject matter under section 101. But Judge Rich overlooked what Justice Stevens pointed out--that Flook did not purport to have implemented the process in anything but a conventional way and did not purport to have added anything to what was previously known but the use of the smoothing formula. Justice Stevens saw the case as one in which Flook did not even purport to have invented anything capable of being patented. (Justice Stevens responded to the Bergy critique in his dissenting opinion in the Diehr case.) Actually, the concession by Flook made the Flook case an easy one. But one could hardly expect any applicant in a subsequent case to make a similar concession. It is unclear how to apply the principle of the Flook case to other cases where no such concession exists. In one class of case, where the implementation is utterly trivial on its face, as in Funk v. Kalo Inoculant Co., the applicability of the same principle seems clear. But that appears to be the outer limit of the easy case. Once reasonable persons can differ on whether the implementation is barely removed from the natural principle, it would seem that the Flook principle cannot be employed. If a full-scale Graham v. Deere analysis must be used to evaluate the implementation, it would seem that the case can no longer be disposed of on section 101 grounds. That is what appears to have happened in the next member of the trilogy, Diamond v. Diehr. For many years commentators thought that Diehr overruled Flook or reduced it to innocuous desuetude. In Mayo v. Prometheus, however, the Supreme Court \\"rehabilitated\\" Flook and harmonized it, Diehr, and the other decisions of the Supreme Court as well as the 19th century English decision of Neilson v. Harford.The harmonization effort and the \\"rehabilitation\\" is discussed in Richard H. Stern, Mayo v. Prometheus: No Patents on Conventional Implementations of Natural Principles and Fundamental Truths, [2012] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 502. The Mayo Court read the prior cases to establish as a centerpiece of this branch of law that for a claimed invention based on the implementation of a law of nature or a \\"principle\\" to gain a patent monopoly, the implementation must not be conventional or trivial but must instead be inventive, which is to say, presumably, novel and not obvious. This has led to further controversy, as discussed in the Wikipedia article on Mayo v. Prometheus. The subsequent opinion of the Supreme Court in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International confirmed the reaffirmation of Flook in the Mayo case, holding that simply implementing an abstract idea on a computer could not confer patent eligibility.

It was created by Jack Gerson and produced by George Gallaccio, and transmitted in ten weekly episodes between 13 June and 15 August. Synopsis Tom Crane () with Drexel. Journalist Tom Crane (James Hazeldine) possesses untapped psychic powers that bring him to the attention of the scientists who comprise Department 7, a secret \\"need to know only\\" government organisation which investigates paranormal phenomena and the potential of the human mind. The phenomena explored include hypnosis, brainwashing, extra-sensory perception, telekinesis, poltergeist phenomena, out-of-body experiences and spiritual possession. Crane joins Department 7 as a means of finding and getting revenge on Edward Drexel (Cyril Luckham), a powerful rogue psychic who is responsible for the death of Crane's wife in an automobile accident. Crane's work with the department, and his own psychic gift, lead Crane to suspect a deadly conspiracy by a mysterious organisation called Omega to take over the world using mind control. The members of Department 7 include physicist Dr. Anne Reynolds (Louise Jameson), an old friend of Crane's wife, and the secretive head of the department, psychiatrist Dr Roy Martindale (John Carlisle). Most episodes see the driven and impetuous Crane in impatient conflict with the cautious Martindale, with Anne (who falls in love with Crane, though she also has a brief relationship with Martindale) caught in the middle. Various subplots develop over the course of the series - notably Crane's hunt for Drexel, his growing suspicions about the Omega conspiracy and his developing relationship with Anne. Episodes Only one series of ten episodes was made. The Omega Factor was produced by BBC Scotland and filmed on location in Edinburgh (making use of a number of Edinburgh landmarks such as the Royal Mile, Holyrood Park, and Edinburgh Zoo), with studio production conducted in Glasgow. Unlike most BBC programmes of the day, the series was shot almost entirely on videotape (as opposed to the then- common practice of using film for exteriors)https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/the-omega-factor/53647/revisiting- the-omega-factor Recurring guest star Natasha Gerson is the daughter of the show's creator. According to her interview for the 2006 DVD release, she auditioned for the role under an assumed name so that the casting agent was not aware of the relation. The series was originally allotted to run thirteen episodes, but to maintain a certain level of quality, the production was scaled back to ten episodes to allow more money to be budgeted per episode. A novel by Jack Gerson, telling the story of Crane's hunt for Drexel (a substantially different story from that in the broadcast series, aside from the first episode which the novel duplicated faithfully), was published as a series accompaniment. Reception The Omega Factor attracted the criticism of public moralist Mary Whitehouse, who described the episode of \\"Powers of Darkness\\" as ‚Äúthoroughly evil‚Äù because it depicted the supernatural and a man burning to death. Legacy The series' combination of science fiction, horror and thriller elements, and its narrative focus on shadowy government departments and conspiracies to gain world domination, as well as the chemistry between James Hazeldine and Louise Jameson's characters, was echoed in the 1990s series The X-Files.https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/the-omega- factor/53647/revisiting-the-omega-factor Although the final episode resolved several of the subplots, it raised several more issues and its ambiguous ending suggests that a second season was anticipated. In 2015 Big Finish Productions began a series of audio plays based on the TV show, with original cast member Louise Jameson reprising her role as Anne Reynolds. The plays are set 30 years after the events of the TV show and feature John Dorney as Adam Dean (Tom Crane's son). The first volume was followed by a second in 2017, with a third series released in 2018.

The school was established in 1846 by the efforts of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Peary Charan Sarkar, and others. The original and most popular name of the school was Barasat Government High School. History The original building exists now but has been condemned since the early 1990s. The official name of the school was changed from Barasat Government High School to Barasat Peary Charan Sarkar Government High School in 1996, in the honour of Peary Charan Sarkar who established the school. Campus The school has the following buildings: *The historic old building was built in the 1850s, and condemned since the early 1990s. *The north wing is a stretch of about five large classrooms and two small rooms. *The southward double-storeyed main building, along with the annexe built almost 30 years ago. A bust of the Peary Charan Sarkar, the founder of the school, welcomes the visitors at the entrance of this block. *The new block is next to the main entrance of school. *The teachers' block lies south of the new block and houses the library besides the teachers' room where the teachers can be found during recess. *The quarter of the resident Headmaster is another old section of the school, dating back to the British Raj.

The Perimeter Highway is approximately in length and serves as an alternate route around Winnipeg for through traffic, as there are no freeways in the city. History and Future Plans The Perimeter Highway is a four-lane divided expressway that consists of a mixture of interchanges and at-grade intersections. It was originally built in 1955 to bypass city centre rush hour traffic. The southern segment of the Perimeter Highway, or South Perimeter, is the Trans-Canada Highway's official Winnipeg Bypass and designated as Highway 100. The northern segment, or North Perimeter is a provincial highway designated as PTH 101. However, PTH 101 is part of Canada's National Highway System while PTH 100 is not. The South Perimeter Highway bridge across the Red River and roadway at Pembina Highway/PTH 75 south was constructed in 1958. The job was tendered to Peter Leitch Construction Ltd. at a cost of $188,670. In December 1957, Dominion Bridge was awarded the contract ($80,157) to supply the structural steel for the overpass. The Perimeter Highway was originally unconnected between PTH 59 and PTH 15 as PTH 59 had received significant upgrades, making the need for a northeast section less pressing. PTH 59 continued to serve as the de facto northeast leg of the Perimeter until the mid-1990s, when PTH 59 and PTH 15 were connected. The last remaining two-lane section was the PTH 59 north interchange, which was upgraded over a three-year span ending in 2018. The highway now encircles Winnipeg as a four-lane roadway. Improvements were made to the western segment of the highway in the early 2010s when PTH 190, Centreport Canada Way, was constructed. In addition to the interchange that connected to this new highway, a flyover was constructed over Saskatchewan Avenue (PR 425) and the adjacent railway crossing; and the median was closed at the entrance to Assiniboia Downs leaving only right-in/right-out access from the southbound side. Planning is currently underway to upgrade the South Perimeter to a six- lane freeway. The first execution of this plan included closing multiple medians and minor accesses to the South Perimeter, and replacing others with right-in/right-out accesses. In 2020, the Manitoba government announced that the first major upgrade would be to replace the traffic signals at St. Mary's Road with an interchange, construction for which is planned to begin in 2021 and finish in 2023. Exit list Exit numbering begins at Fermor Avenue and increases clockwise. Inner city beltway, the second half of the Perimeter plan This roadway is what was to be part of a two ring road system, with the outer Perimeter Highway, and an inner ring. The inner ring was initially tabled in the 1960s and was slow to progress. The inner ring, also sometimes referred to as the inner city beltway, was to be (Route 17) the Chief Peguis Trail to the north, heading west to Route 96 (William R. Clement Pkwy), circling to Route 165 (Bishop Grandin Blvd), and from there to a point near Northern Blower on Route 37 (Regent Ave). Several years ago a group working with a councillor, worked to stop the loop from going into the Transcona area, and had the roadway's land designated a natural prairie grass park. From this point on Regent, the road was supposed to loop north back to Route 17 (Chief Peguis Tr). The current plan has had to move the eastern portion to Plessis Road. Plessis Road is not as suited to the required connection and space for intersections, but is the only remaining viable option. While construction of the east‚Äìwest Bishop Grandin portion was done years ago, the northern portions have remained unlinked, with only the short portion between Route 52 (Main Street) and Lagimodi√®re. This has provided an effective link over the Red River, but the short span of road leaves much of the north part of the city with difficult navigation choices on an east‚Äìwest basis, often pushing major cross town traffic to use residential roads and regional arteries like Inkster, MacIvor and Springfield Roads. The city of Winnipeg completed the extension of Route 17 (Chief Peguis Tr) to Lagimodi√®re Blvd in December 2011. This brings the inner ring road one step further to completion. The absence of a link between the intersection of Route 52 (Main St) and Route 17 (Chief Peguis Tr) toward Route 90 (Brookside Blvd) makes east-west travel difficult, and is an important link for the north part of town to significant areas like the Airport and Red River Community College, as well as the future CentrePort (an inland port). The land for these links is owned by the city and simply awaits the laying of roadway. These type of major traffic arteries are designed to carry crosstown traffic efficiently with fewer environmentally damaging starts and stops. Further these roadways are designed to move traffic away from direct contact with residential streets.

It is located in the city of El Alto, west of La Paz. At an altitude of 4,061.5 m (13,325 ft), it is the highest international airport, the sixth highest commercial airport in the world and the highest commercial airport outside of China. The airport has been in service since the first half of the 20th century, but was modernized in the late 1960s, when its runway was lengthened and a new passenger terminal with modern facilities was built. The new airport was inaugurated in 1965. El Alto airport was a primary hub for the former Lloyd A√©reo Boliviano, Bolivia's flag carrier which ceased operations in 2007 and is a hub for L√≠nea A√©rea Amaszonas. It serves also as a focus city for Boliviana de Aviaci√≥n which is a state-owned airline. History LAB Boeing 727-100 is seen in the foreground with the old terminal and its iconic Inca fa√ßade in the background. Old terminal. Bolivia is characterized by an extremely varied terrain including rugged mountains, high plateaus, low valleys and tropical forests; this topography has had a negative effect on national transportation, making communication difficult between elevated and low cities along with isolated tropical towns. Aviation is an important solution for isolated communities in this environment. Bolivian air transport started in 1916, when the Military school of Aviation () was formed in La Paz. In 1929 the local La Paz Government first planned the construction of an airport. However it was not officially inaugurated until the 1960s. In 1974 the airport was reconstructed, a new terminal was built and its facilities were enlarged and modernized.http://www.gobernacionlapaz.gob.bo:8001/simit/sistema/ficha_turistica/fichaturistica.php?atr_id=254 Until 1999 the airport had John F. Kennedy (JFK) as its official name although in practice this name was never publicly used. In that year, before the pressure of different sectors, by means of the Law 1944 during the government of Hugo Banzer Su√°rez the airport changed its name officially to El Alto International Airport. =Modernization= In 2006, SABSA () invested nearly 2.3 million dollars in the reconstruction of the main terminal. http://www.mirabolivia.com/foro_total.php?id_foro_ini=51639 Con una inversi√≥n de 2,3 millones de d√≥lares The new terminal consists of the enlargement, reshaping and construction of the baggage claim room, the check-in area and the corridor to the air bridges. The administrative offices of AASANA as well as the main hall and the international area were completely modernized. http://www.mirabolivia.com/foro_total.php?id_foro_ini=51639  Characteristics  At more than 13,000 ft above sea level, El Alto is one of the highest international airports in the world The new terminal includes various shops offering Bolivian handicrafts as well as bookstores, and duty- free shops. There are also restaurants and cafes in the main lobby and in both domestic and international departure areas. The airport has two runways: The main one \\"10R/28L\\" has a concrete surface and is long, allowing large aircraft operations at higher altitudes. A second runway, \\"10L/28R\\" is located parallel to the main runway and has a grass surface. The airport is equipped with VOR/DME, DVOR/DME navigation systems, as well as ILS CAT I approach systems. El Alto is the world's highest international airport, located at above sea level. The average temperature at the airport is . Because of the thin high altitude air, most commercial wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and Airbus A330 cannot operate at full load out of El Alto International Airport. As a result, much of the international traffic to and from Bolivia operates out of Viru Viru International Airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra which is located at a much lower altitude, allowing heavy aircraft operations. = Flight testing = As one of the world's highest-altitude airports, El Alto offers features taken advantage of by aircraft manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing to test high-altitude takeoff and landing. Modern aircraft such as the Airbus A350 XWB and Boeing 787 have used El Alto to perform flight tests for their certification processes. Operators From 1997, the airport was managed by TBI plc which owned concessions of the three biggest airports in the country: El Alto International Airport, Jorge Wilstermann International Airport and Viru Viru International Airport through its subsidiary Servicio de Aeropuertos Bolivianos S.A. (SABSA). In 1999 Airport Group International was purchased by TBI plc. In 2004, the company was acquired by the Spanish conglomerate Abertis, hence taking ownership of SABSA. In February 2013, the Government of Bolivia announced the nationalization of SABSA, taking full ownership and operations of Bolivia's main international gateways.

She was crowned at the age of 18, following a two-day competition at Liverpool's Olympia Theatre on 3 September 2005, and was chosen from 40 contestants.  Biography  Kohistani was born in 1987 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, when it was part of the USSR to Afghan parents who moved there as refugees. Kohistani is of the Afghan Tajik ethnic group. During the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War her parents fled to what was then the Uzbek SSR in the Soviet Union. She and her parents returned to Kabul, Afghanistan, but in 1996 they escaped from there when the Taliban took control of the city. They eventually made it to the United Kingdom and settled in Southall, in West London, where her father Kushal set up a fast food restaurant. Kohistani speaks six languages, including English, Russian and Persian. She won the competition as a brunette, dressed in an ivory white chiffon and silk ball gown. She later said \\"When they announced that I had won I thought I had misheard. I hoped they hadn't, but it took a second to sink in.\\" She also said that she was \\"happy to make history,\\" that \\"I'm making history and I'm very happy. Hopefully I won't be the last\\" and that she was looking forward to representing England in the Miss World championships. She was known as \\"Miss Maya\\" after the Asian fashion house which sponsored her, and was reportedly offered a part in a forthcoming Bollywood movie. The Miss England competition included another Muslim, Sarah Mendly, who had been voted Miss Nottingham. Her entry had caused controversy, since contestants typically wear relatively little clothing, and was called upon to pull out of the contest by the Liverpool Islamic Institute. Kohistani represented England in the Miss World championships in China in December 2005, but despite being one of the favourites, she failed to advance to the semifinal of 16. Kohistani studied in London and attended Lampton School in Hounslow and was a student at Uxbridge College. After Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke to members of parliament on the anniversary of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, saying that Muslims needed to curb extremism, Kohistani criticised the government as stirring up animosity against Muslims. Kohistani was featured in Teen Vogue magazine in May 2006. One of Kohistani's portraits on stock photo site Getty Images was used as the basis for the face of the extraterrestrial character Tali'Zorah from the Mass Effect series of video games.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYOeaV0Daichttp://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/photo/hammasa- royalty-free-image/123488108 References External links * Hammasa Kohistani - official Miss World biography * Hammasa Kohistani - Miss England Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Uzbekistani people of Afghan descent Category:British female models Category:British Muslims Category:Miss England winners Category:Miss World 2005 delegates Category:People from Tashkent Category:People from Southall Category:Afghan Tajik people Category:Uzbekistani emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:Uzbekistani people of Tajik descent Category:British people of Tajik descent Category:Afghan refugees ","title":"Hammasa Kohistani"},{"id":"2614082","text":"Kaspien Holdings (formerly Trans World Entertainment) is an American company that provides software and services for ecommerce.

In Archaeology it has been used to various ends in the subdisciplines of Zooarchaeology and Bioarchaeology. In zooarchaeology the main goal of osteometry is taxonomic determination and, to a lesser extent, determination of sex. The most useful elements to measure in sex determination are the pelvis and cranium. Jaco Weinstock, 1991 Usually it is very difficult to discriminate between different species of the same genus or family (e.g. South American camelids), and the statistical analysis of osteometric parameters is quite useful. In bioarchaeology osteometry is useful to help answer many anthropological questions about past human populations. For example, it may be used to determine kinship, sex, the degree of sexual dimorphism (which may be used to answer questions related to lack of nutrition) and to some extent ethnicity. Osteometry is also used in the identification of human remains, particularly in commingled assemblages. It's used in addition to DNA analysis for individual identification. John E. Byrd, Carrie B. LeGarde, 2014, p. 167-191 There are many problems around the interpretation of osteometric data: loose replicability of the measurements, problems relative to the phenotypic variations between subpopulations of one species, and others. Purpose Comparison of various aspects of ancient skeletons can be used to determine which species a skeleton belongs to, or if the differences are vast enough, create a new species. In later skeletons, osteometry has historically been used to attempt to identify the ethnicity or race of skeletons. Aspects commonly studied in determining the species of very early skeletons include the length of the femur and other long bones, the capacity of the skull, the shape of the facial features and skull, the shape of the jaw and teeth, the curve of the spine, the situation and shape of the pelvis, and the location of the foramen magnum.

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries much of the hill was quarried for chalk.Panoramic view from the hill The hill is a nature reserve which is managed by Kent Wildlife Trust. It is also part of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Wouldham to Detling Escarpment Sites of Special Scientific Interest and is a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I. A picnic area serves as a rest point for walkers on the North Downs Way which runs along the top of the hill, whilst the prehistoric trackway of the Pilgrims' Way skirts its foot. A modern crematorium also surmounts the hill. The A229 dual carriageway follows the route of a former Roman road and climbs the hill, today linking the M2 and M20 motorways. High Speed 1 runs beneath the hill, via the North Downs Tunnel, and archaeological work in advance of it uncovered a Neolithic long house on its slopes. The Bluebell Hill transmitting station is on the hill, as is the Lower Bell pub.

The Blue Bell Hill Dolmen was a now lost member of the group of Neolithic chamber tombs in the English county of Kent. It is thought to have been one of the Medway Megaliths. Its precise location is unclear but it stood on Blue Bell Hill on the North Downs between Maidstone and Rochester, to the north of Kit's Coty House. Only fragments of antiquarians' records now remain. It was possibly investigated in 1844 and was still extant in the early twentieth century. A sketch in Maidstone Museum indicates that three sarsen standing stones survived to heights of 7 feet forming the walls of the burial chamber. A stone that may have formed the capstone lay between them. The tomb was found to have contained the skeleton of a man and fragments of red pottery were found although none of these has since survived. A kerb of smaller stones surrounded the larger ones and beneath the standing stones was a large circular pit dug into the natural chalk and filled with many flints. Local people told the investigating antiquarians that many such pits had been found on the hill and that the flints were used as a source of stone to metal new roads. From these fragments it is thought that one, or possibly more, chamber tombs stood on Blue Bell Hill in addition to the surviving Medway Megaliths.Source:Kent Sites and Monuments Record TQ 76 SW 22\\\\- A Roman temple was also later built on the hill.

There were Christians among its population as early as the second century, and probably as early as the third century there was a bishop at Trier, which is the oldest episcopal see in Germany. The first clearly authenticated bishop is Agricius, who took part in the Council of Arles in 314.Lins, Joseph. \\"Trier.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15.

He was present at the Council of Arles in 314, where he signed the acts immediately after the presiding bishop of that diocese. This indicated that, at least in the fourth century, Trier laid claim to the primacy of Gaul and Germany, a claim his successor Saint Maximin reinforced.Grey, Francis. \\"St. Agricius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

The bailout cylinder can be seen slung at the diver's left side Solo diving is the practice of underwater diving without a \\"dive buddy\\", particularly with reference to scuba diving, but the term is also applied to freediving. Surface supplied diving and atmospheric suit diving are single diver underwater activities but are accompanied by an on- surface support team dedicated to the safety of the diver, and not considered solo diving in its truest sense. Solo diving has been in existence for millennia as evidenced by artifacts dating back to the ancient people of Mesopotamia when humans dove for food and collected pearl oysters. It wasn't until the 1950s, with the development of formalised recreational dive training, that recreational solo diving was considered dangerous, particularly for beginners. In an effort to mitigate associated risks, some scuba certification agencies incorporated the practice of buddy diving into their dive training programmes. Some divers, typically those with advanced underwater skills, prefer solo diving over buddy diving and assume responsibility for their own safety. Professionally, solo diving has always been an option as it applies to operational requirements and risk assessment. It customarily involves voice or line communications from diver to surface, usually with a diver at the surface on standby ready to assist on short notice. Recreational divers seldom have such options available. The recreational solo diver uses enhanced procedures, skills and equipment to mitigate the risks associated with not having another diver immediately available to assist if something goes wrong. The skills and procedures may be learned through effective methods with appropriate competence, including formal training programmes with associated assessment and certification. Recreational solo diving, once discouraged by most training agencies, has been accepted since the late 1990s by some training agencies that will qualify experienced divers skilled in self-sufficiency and redundant backup equipment. Definition Solo diving is defined as a dive planned to be conducted entirely or partly without a buddy. It may also apply to dives that begin with a buddy but continue after separation, and to dives where other divers are nearby but are neither responsible for the safety of the solo diver, nor competent to deal with the consequences of a foreseeable contingency. The term has also been used to define dives where buddies are insufficiently attentive or close enough to function effectively as a buddy pair, a situation more commonly referred to as \\"same ocean buddy diving\\". History The history of solo diving stands in stark contrast to the relatively new concept of buddy diving that was developed for recreational diving in the early to mid-20th century. Artifacts dating back some 4,500 years provide evidence of solo diving for food and commerce by the ancient people of Mesopotamia. There are written accounts from 2nd century BC that describe commercial sponge fishing, including notes about sponge divers, their lifestyle and fear of predatory sharks. In 350 BC, Aristotle wrote about \\"an 'elephant nose-like tube' that allowed sponge fishermen to breathe during diving\\", and in 8th‚Äì6th century BC, there are references to solo diving in the writings of Homer. Freedivers traditionally dove alone or with an attendant on the surface to assist with the harvest, and many of the early diving bells were only large enough for a single occupant. When surface supplied diving was first developed, it was common to have only one diver unless the work required more. Those early traditions continue and customarily include a standby diver, and a working diver who is in constant communication with the surface control crew. The sport of scuba diving is rooted in a multitude of small enthusiastic snorkeling and spearfishing clubs that date back to the decades just before and after World War II. In the late 1940s, after the invention of the Aqua- lung by Cousteau and Gagnan, the first retail underwater breathing apparatus for sport was commercially marketed. As the sport expanded through the 1950s, several sporting organisations ‚Äì notably the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) ‚Äì began scuba training programmes for swimming enthusiasts, thus began the codification of what was believed to be proper practices for the expanding amateur sport of scuba diving. The buddy system was thought to be a useful corollary to the \\"never swim alone\\" edicts of the YMCA swimming and lifesaving programmes. Cousteau independently implemented a buddy system after a number of harrowing diving incidents that date back to the earliest days of exploratory diving. The buddy system's useful aspects have long been established, including the cross-checking of equipment before dives, the facilitating of assistance for possible entanglement problems or equipment failures, and enhancement of the social nature of diving. The YMCA was a substantial influence in the development of diver certification during the first 50 years of the sport. As various scuba programmes were adopted by emerging scuba certification agencies, such as the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI), Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI), and British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC), the practise of buddy diving inspired one of the two main mantras of recreational scuba: \\"never hold your breath\\" and \\"never dive alone\\". By the early to mid-1990s, solo divers became more visible and increasingly open about their alternative dive safety philosophy, despite the recreational industry's established adherence to the buddy system. It wasn't until 2001 that Scuba Diving International (SDI) initiated formal certification training specifically for solo diving. Several other agencies eventually followed suit with certificates titled Self-reliant Diver and variations of that theme; all with the intention of improving diver competence without necessarily going solo, and recognising that the buddy system does not always comply with the ideal. At the 2012 \\"Rebreather Forum 3\\", a significant minority of attendees were of the opinion that, in some circumstances, it would be acceptable to dive solo on rebreathers. Reasons for solo scuba diving An underwater photographer intent on the composition of his next photograph The intention of using the buddy system when scuba diving is to improve the chances of avoiding or surviving accidents in or underwater. Diving together in close groups of two or sometimes three divers, and co-operating with each other to help or perform a rescue in an emergency situation may save a life; however, it is most effective when each buddy is competent in all the relevant skills and remain consistently and sufficiently aware in order to respond in time. Some divers, such as instructors, are effectively acting as self-sufficient divers because they dive with students who may not yet be trained in or capable of rescue. Others, such as underwater photographers and videographers, dive solo as it allows them to focus more on capturing selected images rather than relying on buddies to remain close at hand. Photographers or videographers who dive with buddies are often effectively \\"same ocean\\" buddies, implying they may be far enough apart physically, or sufficiently focused on their camera-related tasks, to be ineffective as a designated dive buddy. This practice has led to many highly experienced underwater photographers diving solo since they don't commit to provide timely support to a buddy nor expect such support from a buddy. Underwater hunters often elect to dive solo in order to focus on their prey. Solo diving was considered technical diving by most recreational diver certification agencies and discouraged as more dangerous than buddy diving, but many experienced divers and some certification agencies consider it an acceptable practice for suitably trained, equipped, and competent recreational divers; some others consider it occasionally inevitable. In place of relying on the buddy diving safety system, solo divers try to be self-sufficient and are willing to take responsibility for their own safety while diving. The first training agency to offer a Solo Diving certification was SDI in 1999. In 2011, the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) started offering a solo specialty called \\"Self-Reliant Diver\\", which in many respects (entry requirements, for example) is very similar to the course offered by SDI. In professional diving, solo diving is normal procedure when one diver is sufficient to perform the required task, particularly on surface supplied equipment, to the extent that it is not even noted as an exception. However, a standby diver is required at the surface or at the bell, and the working diver must be in communication with the supervisor at the surface. Procedures for the dive are based on assessed risk. In recreational diving, solo diving is an option chosen by the diver, for any combination of several reasons. * Solo divers don't need to work around a buddy's diving schedule, and can dive when no trusted and familiar buddy is available. * Some divers will dive in a buddy pair if diving with a known and trusted buddy but otherwise dive solo in preference to being paired up with a potentially unreliable, incompetent, or otherwise dangerous partner. In the United States, the added risk of becoming a respondent in litigation in the event of a diving accident with such a \\"dangerous buddy\\" can be a motivation to dive alone. * The diver may simply prefer to dive alone. Diving professionals Wes Skiles and Ken Loyst, among others, take pleasure in the solitude of solo diving and in the feeling of self-sufficiency for this style of diving, that one is not dependent on others, but is relying solely on one's own skills and capabilities. Other experienced professionals, including Bret Gilliam and Darren Webb, enjoy the sense of freedom, of not being impeded by the need to look after anyone but oneself and therefore being able to achieve one's own goal in the dive without compromising. * There are divers who enjoy specific underwater activities but are unable to find anyone who shares the specific interest sufficiently to dive with them, and where the activity is incompatible with a less than dedicated buddy. The option of simply not diving is not a practical solution, as the diver is then almost permanently prevented from pursuing the interest. Diving with buddies who get bored or tired quickly also does not lead to enhanced enjoyment for either party. When the underwater activity is of interest only to one person, diving solo is the only option that allows the activity to be undertaken. * When photographing or shooting video of shy animals which are easily disturbed, it is more likely to be successful if there is only one diver potentially disturbing the subjects. The disturbance can also be reduced by buddy diving on rebreathers, which cuts down on bubble noise, but at the cost of increased risk due to the inherently higher number of failure modes characteristic of rebreathers. It is not clear which system has the lower overall risk. * Most scuba depth records are set by solo divers. There is usually a substantial backup team on site and standing by, but for the record breaking part of the dive, the diver is almost always alone, and beyond the reasonable expectation of rescue. Disadvantages of the buddy system Scuba diving is done in a hostile environment for which humans are not adapted, breathing from a portable and limited capacity life support system. Under these conditions fatality is always a possible outcome, as even simple equipment or procedural problems can be mishandled. In dealing with this reality a number of major concerns about potentially inherent flaws or negative impacts that can exist within the buddy system have been identified. Few, if any, of these problems are defects in the concept of the buddy system, they are problems with the application of the system. The amount of discipline, effort and attention needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has other things to do during a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, and the system is undermined when any one of the divers fails to put in the effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment, and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that there will not be a problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay less attention to good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and the whims of the divemaster, who have no real interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible. Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer will annoy at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence. Critics of the buddy system state that the proponents project the image of a \\"totally reliable buddy\\" that does not generally exist in reality. Some buddies lack skills or experience and some are unfit, and some personality types are outright dangers; these types have been described as \\"the untrained diver\\", \\"the high-flyer\\", \\"the falsely confident diver\\", \\"the angry diver\\", \\"the buddy from hell\\" and several others. The bad buddy problem is compounded by training that pressurises the diver to \\"stick with his buddy\\" at all times, leading to the situation that the bad buddy sets the criteria of how (badly) the dive is carried out. The solo diver avoids this problem altogether. Risks and their mitigation The generic risks of recreational diving include: * running out of breathing gas * equipment failure and inappropriate response * uncontrolled rapid ascent ‚Äì loss of buoyancy control * unawareness of decompression status * inability to return to the surface ‚Äì getting lost under an overhead, or physically trapped * overestimating ability to successfully complete a dive ‚Äì including environmental, physical fitness and medical concerns. These risks can be reduced and the consequences mitigated by correct application of knowledge, skills, fitness and equipment. Where a single point of failure is likely to seriously compromise safety, redundant equipment can be carried, and the skills learned to effectively use the equipment without undue delay. There has been much disagreement over the relative safety and merits of solo diving. Up to 2003, very few statistics existed regarding the impact of solo diving on safety, as the subject had not been specifically studied. A 2006 report from the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) concluded that \\"BSAC currently takes the view that based on evidence from available statistics and risk assessment, the increased risk attendant to allowing planned solo diving is unacceptable\\". The data underlying the statistics which are used to point to the dangers of solo diving are questionable: for example, divers who end up dying alone but originally had started out as part of a buddy pair are often considered to be \\"diving solo\\" in such statistics, but whether the separation was a consequence of the triggering incident rather than a cause is not analyzed. In actuality, studies show that with fatal buddy diving incidents, 57% of deaths happened after the buddy pair had separated from one another during the emergency. Again, these cases could be attributed to failure of the buddy system rather than failure of any solo diving/self sufficient diving system. A further complication in such statistics is that certain more dangerous diving practices (e.g. cave diving) are frequently carried out solo. Therefore, it is questionable whether a death in these circumstances should be attributed to solo diving or to cave diving. Analysis of the figures used by BSAC to categorise solo diving as dangerous shows that during 2001‚Äì2008 all but one of these \\"solo diving deaths\\" were actually paired buddy divers that became separated during or before the fatal incident (75%) or else were divers diving far outside of the limits set by both SDI and PADI for the practice of solo diving (20%) (i.e. actually deep divers, rebreather tech-divers, and/or cave divers). Two further \\"solo-diving deaths\\" were not scuba divers at all, but snorkelers. In almost all circumstances, two highly competent, totally self-sufficient divers diving a specific dive profile as a buddy pair are at lower risk than those same two divers diving exactly the same profile separately, but this raises the question \\"how often do normal buddy divers both really fit into this particular description?\\" When considering the risks in solo diving the alternative risks found predominantly in buddy diving need also be considered. The greatest danger to sports divers is inexperience ‚Äì 60% of all diving fatalities involve divers having less than 20 completed dives. The buddy system itself can be a source of risk ‚Äì a 2006 survey showed that 52% of buddy divers were at some time actually endangered by a buddy's behavior or actions. While there are hazards specifically associated with solo diving, most of these can be planned for and their consequences mitigated by the use of appropriate equipment. In technical diving, where redundancy of critical equipment is standard policy, self-sufficiency is emphasised and taught more extensively than in recreational diving. This philosophy should also be followed by solo divers. A solo diver operating beyond the range for acceptable risk for a controlled emergency swimming ascent needs to carry a second, independent source of suitable breathing gas, which includes a regulator and preferably a submersible pressure gauge. This emergency gas supply typically takes the form of a pony bottle, or for more demanding diving, a twin tank set with the capability of independent operation of each tank. Additional equipment carried may include a backup dive computer, a backup dive light and a backup dive mask. The diver must be familiar with the equipment configuration used and be able to access the equipment easily if it is needed. A solo diver needs to be particularly aware of overall personal fitness and health and the limitations it may impose on their ability to manage an emergency. Finally, the solo diver may dive a more conservative dive plan than he or she might dive with an equally competent buddy diver. As part of mitigating risks in solo diving the following specific practices have been adopted by SDI for solo diving or are key recommendations by Robert von Maier‚Äîauthor of the 1991 book Solo Diving: The Art of Underwater Self- Sufficiency: * All solo diving is to be done within recreational dive limits (no deep, decompression, penetration, or rebreather dives while solo). * No dives which significantly exceed one's personal experience limits are to be undertaken while solo * No solo dives are to be undertaken in areas where there are known hazards of entanglement/entrapment * Solo dives will only be undertaken to depths at which the bailout system used carries an acceptable level of risk, the appropriate equipment is carried, and where the relevant bailout procedures have been practiced successfully by the diver. * The solo diver's maximum distance to point of exit (shore, boat) will never exceed a distance that can be easily and comfortably swum at the surface in full scuba gear ‚Äì and the diver will maintain and exercise his/her navigational practices in solo dives to ensure that this is the case. Self sufficiency The core objective in training to be a solo diver is to become as self-sufficient and self-reliant as possible, to be able to deal with any reasonably foreseeable problems without assistance, and to have the competence, fitness, discipline, skills and equipment that will achieve this result. This requires competence at risk-assessment and the ability to plan dives and select equipment that limit the risks. An additional benefit of these disciplines is that they will improve the safety of buddy diving whenever the competent solo diver pairs up with another diver in a buddy team by reducing the risk of the second diver being exposed to an emergency which they may not be capable of managing. Agencies training solo divers also recommend the self-sufficiency training in their courses for all divers as their diving experience grows, so as to achieve greater safety in all diving‚Äîbuddy and solo. Training and equipment To be safe, solo divers must be self-sufficient, well trained, prepared and practised. They should have a completely redundant set of all life support equipment - a complete, self-contained backup breathing gas supply sufficient to return to the surface from any point of the planned dive profile. In addition, the responsible solo divers adhere to a very conservative dive profile, both in depth and level of difficulty. Unlike the buddy system, which encourages divers to rely on others in the event of an emergency, solo diving encourages divers to prepare themselves to overcome emergencies by their own means. The divers who engage in solo diving are typically those who are experienced and equipped enough to handle problems themselves. Solo divers must feel totally comfortable and relaxed in doing this sort of diving, and nobody should ever think of doing diving solo if they are not both competent and comfortable in doing so. Solo divers are trained to extend their experience gradually, and to ensure that they remain within their personal comfort zone where possible. This reduces the risk of excessive task loading and possible panic reaction to an otherwise manageable contingency. This is not unique to solo diver training, it is a common training practice for any hazardous activity, but when exposing oneself to circumstances where there is no backup it is more important. This means that changes to environment, depth, or equipment are best made one at a time, so that the diver can become familiar with a small change in circumstances before adding another. Simulating emergencies for practice and ensuring that one's response is prompt, appropriate and effective will reduce the risk of inappropriate response if the real emergency occurs. Qualifications for formal solo diving training as provided by SDI emphasises the need for experience and maturity in diving. In particular the student prerequisites for the solo diving certification course are: * a minimum age of 21 years * a minimum certification of SDI/PADI Advanced Open Water Diver (or equivalent) * proof of a minimum of 100 logged open water dives * depending on the country ‚Äì a certificate of medical fitness to dive. Most of the equipment needed for solo diving is the same as that which would be used for buddy diving the same profile at the same place. The single most important item of additional equipment is the redundant breathing gas supply, which must be sufficient to get the diver safely to the surface from any point of the planned dive. There is more than one way to achieve this, and they each have their advantages and disadvantages. * Isolation manifolded twin cylinders. Standard technical diving back mount configuration. Allows access to all the gas through either regulator, but the valves may be difficult to reach for the less supple diver, and it must be possible to reach the isolation valve to shut it off in case of a catastrophic leak. Heavy and bulky, and requires a suitable harness and BCD. * Independent back-mounted twin cylinders. Heavy and bulky, and requires a suitable harness and BCD. Enough gas to surface safely must be left in each cylinder at all times. * Sidemount with two cylinders. This arrangement is standard for sidemount diving. It requires a suitable harness and BCD. Enough gas to surface safely must be left in each cylinder at all times. * Single back mounted primary with back-mounted pony bailout set. This is convenient when in the water and keeps the bailout out of the way, but makes the scuba set heavier than a single when out of the water, and may need trim weights for lateral balance. * Single back mounted primary with side slung bailout set. Reasonably convenient, easily accessible demand valve, pressure gauge and valve knob, but the bailout can get in the way a bit and mounting the cylinder takes a bit of practice. Very portable between dives, the same bailout can be used for a large number of dives without any modification or adjustment. Trim weight may be needed for lateral balance. Size can be whatever is available - as long as it is sufficient and is not too heavy. Even an aluminium 80 can be comfortably carried this way by a moderately large diver. An aluminium 40 is enough for almost any recreational dive, and is one of the more popular options for bulk and buoyancy, and remains useful for most recreational dive profiles even when partly used. * Harness mounted \\"spare air\\" type miniature bailout set. These are light and compact but carry a very limited gas supply and are only suitable for fairly shallow dives. Other more complex arrangements of three or more cylinders are possible, but not usually of any advantage for recreational solo diving. Arrangements using H- and Y-valved back gas cylinders with two first stages may be useful if there is a risk of regulator freezing, but do not provide full redundancy. For solo diving an octopus regulator is not needed ‚Äì it is intended for supplying gas to another diver. Another item which is very useful for the solo diver is the delayed surface marker buoy (DSMB) with a reel or spool suited to the depth of the planned dive. =Self-reliance skills= Besides competence in the standard set of scuba skills, there are a few more advanced self-reliance and self- rescue skills required by some of the training agencies. The diver should be able to select and correctly use all equipment needed for the dive, including self-extrication gear for cutting loose from entanglement. A solo diver needs to be able to prepare, dress in and check all equipment used without buddy assistance. The diver must have an acceptable alternative air configuration, redundant gauges and/or computers, DSMB and reel, compass, and (depending on training centre) signalling device and line cutting device. During the course tests are conducted on swimming skills and swimming endurance, scuba skills associated with solo diving (e.g. use of redundant air and bailout to emergency gas supply), navigation skills and dive planning skills (including breathing gas management). The CMAS Self-Rescue Diver training includes the deployment of colour-coded DSMBs - red for position indication, and yellow to indicate a problem ‚Äì the use of a ratchet dive reel to control ascent rate in the event of unplanned positive buoyancy due to loss of weights, and the use of a backup mask. =Certifications in solo and self-reliant diving= * CDG ‚Äì (Cave Diving Group) ‚Äì the UK organisation prepares divers for solo cave diving in sub-optimum conditions as part of their cave diving skills requirement. * CMAS ‚Äì (Conf√©d√©ration Mondiale des Activit√©s Subaquatiques) ‚Äì Self-Rescue Diver: prerequisite ‚Äì Two star diver. * DIWA ‚Äì (Diving Instructor World Association) ‚Äì Self-reliant diver: prerequisite ‚Äì Advanced open-water diver. * SDI ‚Äì (Scuba Diving International) ‚Äì Solo diver: prerequisite ‚Äì SDI Advanced Diver or equivalent. * IANTD ‚Äì (International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers) ‚Äì Self-sufficient diver: prerequisite ‚Äì IANTD Deep Diver or equivalent. * PADI ‚Äì (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) ‚Äì Self Reliant Diver: prerequisites: PADI Advanced Open Water Diver, at least 18 years old and 100 logged dives. * SSI ‚Äì (Scuba Schools International) ‚Äì Independent Diving: prerequisites: Night & Limited Visibility, Navigation, Deep Diving and Stress & Rescue Certification. Legal status In most countries there is no government regulation of recreational diving and solo diving is at the discretion of the diver in publicly accessible waters. There are some exceptions: * In the Republic of Maldives, recreational solo diving is illegal under any circumstances, as is recreational diving to depths greater than 30 m and any recreational diving which requires decompression stops. * In Israel, a person may not take part in a recreational dive unless accompanied by at least one other qualified diver.

The UAE does not have diplomatic relations with Israel. A number of players, among them Venus Williams, condemned the visa rejection. The 2008 winner of the men's singles, Andy Roddick, withdrew from the tournament and chose not to defend his title (with prize money of over $2 million) to protest the UAE's refusal to grant Pe'er a visa. \\"I really didn't agree with what went on over there\\", Roddick said.

Retrieved on February 18, 2009. WTA chief Larry Scott said that he had considered cancelling the tournament, but chose not to after consulting Pe'er. Tournament director Salah Tahlak said that Pe'er was refused on the grounds that her appearance could incite anger in the Arab country after she had already faced protests at the ASB Classic over the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. The WTA said that it would review future tournaments in Dubai. Following the protests over the UAE's decision to refuse her visa in 2009, Pe'er was granted a visa in 2010 but was placed under very strict restrictions. She was not allowed to mix with other players off the court, was required to exercise in a separate gym, and was under strict guard on her way from the hotel to the court. To add to the pressure, the tournament took place at the time when Dubai authorities were investigating the killing of Hamas military commander Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, which the UAE blamed on Israeli agents, some posing as European tennis fans. Pe'er was widely praised by her fellow competitors for her composure under pressure during the tournament. In particular, Venus Williams remarked: \\"I can't imagine playing so well with these kinds of circumstances. I just have to give her congratulations and props. She's courageous. I don't think anyone else on the WTA Tour could do what she's doing\\". =Playing style= Pe'er originally played with a \\"counter-puncher\\" style, but by 2010 she had adopted a more attacking style of play. Her forehand uses a semi-western grip, which makes her good in facing big top-spin opponents. Her backhand is two-handed and is one of the best on the women's tour. It is consistent and finds various angles throughout the court. She loves to take many points with the inside out shot on her backhand. She originally used a kick serve that lacked the drive needed to penetrate deep, but she changed it to more of a slice serve, which works great for her now and even generates aces. She has a good volley and doesn't have a problem going to the net. During matches, she often turns her back to her opponent between points, faces the back of the court, closes her eyes and tries to wipe the mental slate clean. =Federation Cup= Pe'er is 21‚Äì12 in Fed Cup matches for Israel in 2002‚Äì09, having won 13 of her last 16 singles matches.Shahar PEER profile, Fed Cup. Retrieved April 29, 2008. She tasted victory again in 2009 beating both the Bondarenko sisters of Ukraine in Kharkiv.

Geography Somewhat isolated in a valley, the village is at an altitude of about 500 meters above sea level. It is the only Due Sorru that faces the sea, since the rest of the region lies beyond Col Saint Antoine and thus faces inland. Two others valleys, now uninhabited, form with the first a territory that varies in elevation from just above sea level to almost 700 meters above it. The village, then, is situated in both mountainous and seaside areas. The area's climate is as follows: strong winds from both the mountains and the sea, a few days of snow in winter, and a several-week-long summer heatwave softened by summer breezes from the mountains. Precariously perched, the village is in constant danger of rockslides from the nearby granite cliffs, although rockslides have yet to cause any serious damage. In winter, the beautiful sunsets of the Calanche de Piana come and spend several months in Balogna - for a quarter of an hour before nightfall, the village shines orange. History The village was established relatively recently, under the Genoan rule. One hypothesis holds that it was originally a place to exile people from Balagne (hence the name) who resisted Genoan rule, which would explain a lot. No old artifacts exist in Balogna even though there are many in the surrounding area. On the other hand, there is a prehistoric site at Tragonatu. Like elsewhere in Corsica, the peak in population - perhaps 800 people - was reached in the nineteenth century, but the population is stable at about 200 people, with the highest or perhaps the only high birthrate in the area. Administration Politics in Balogna are similar to those in the rest of Corsica - rather than contests between the left and the right, elections are between nationalists, Catholics, and secularists. The Due Sorru region is nonetheless considered rightist, more due to its postcolonial history than anything else. In 2006, Balogna was the only place in Corsica that had a nationalist majority - a regional nationalism that is based on the wisdom of the people and the defense of a country that has always remained quite poor in spite of its excellent location and the intellectual and political successes of its exiles on the continents and in Ajaccio. This is a wisdom that does not seem to involve raising the stature of this village by improving it. Recently, however, the narrow road leading to the village has been widened, and three supporting walls, one made of granite, have been constructed, and one of the two lavoirs was restored. Population Population change 1990 - 1999: + 10 inhabitants *Natural change 1990 - 1999: -25 *Migratory change 1990 - 1999: +35 *Average yearly population change 1990 - 1999: + 0.6% Gendered breakdown in 1999: *men 51.2% (national average 48.6%) *women 48.8% (national average 51.4%) Age breakdown in 1999: *Older than 75 10.6% (national average 7.7%) *60‚Äì74 years old 37.1% (national average 13.6%) *40‚Äì59 years old 22.9% (national average 26%) *20‚Äì39 years old 20% (national average 28.1%) *0‚Äì19 years old 9.4% (national average 24.6%) Households in 1999: *1 person households 32.9% (national average 31%) *2 person households 35.6% (national average 31.1%) *3 person households 12.3% (national average 16.2%) *4 person households 8.2% (national average 13.8%) *5 person households 8.2% (national average 5.5%) *6 or more person households 2.7% (national average 2.4%) Sights The village is spread out and divided into several quarters - at the entrance, around the church, the \\"Corte\\", whose atmosphere reminds one of certain villages of the Venetian Lagoon or in certain rural parts of Tuscany. The long circular route that give its shape to the village makes a sharp turn to cross U Canale, a place whose name might come from an old canal or from one of the old families that lives there, if not both. Then the road turns towards the location of the first houses built under Genoan rule, which stand protected at the bottom of the valley, \\"A Cardiccia\\". There are also more specific quarters like Guazzina, named after the fountain located there. Finally, three uninhabited valleys behind the village that were once in use (chestnuts, olives, kilns) make up the rest of the territory of the commune. Now this area is used for hunting, hiking, and swims in streams or in the river Sagone. Two bridges, one recent, one dating back to the nineteenth century, apparently the result of first attempt at a Genoan bridge, show the lasting efforts of conquest and control of the territory. Until 1930, there was an important mule road, which explains why the Balogna families are so close to those of Marignana even though the routes between two such formerly close villages are now so indirect. The main visible monument, Balogna's church is typical of a Toscan country style - you can also see the same style in the Tuscan Apennines, on the other side of the sea. The bell tower was built after the church itself. The only flat part of the village, the parvis, above the cemetery, is a place of rest and joy. The church is dedicated to the village's patron saint, Santu Quilicus, after whom it is named. Santu Quilicus translates to Saint Cyr, but this name is never used. Santu Quilicus' day is also the village's holiday, and it is celebrated with a parade and with games and feasting July 14 and 15. At the base of the commune, there is a hot spring, but unfortunately it is located on private land and not accessible to the public. Two buildings bear witness to past activity. The old inn, which could have housed about thirty people, has been turned into a barn. Since then, one has to imagine the wooden partitions, dormitories, bedrooms, common meals and games at night to relieve the boredom of the patients... Nearby, there are two springs with mythic virtues - one hot and sulphureous, the other cold but also sulphureous. The first was famous for having \\"bleached\\" psoriasis, and the second was good for the eyes. There was one bath for men and one for women, as found elsewhere in Corsica. Only one remains. In the 1970s, European investors supported the construction of a golf course attached to a thermal station, but now only the olive trees, clementine trees, and feral animals give the place its charm.

His first band was called Urin, but in 1977 he founded Ebba Gr√∂n (at first called The Haters) together with Joakim Th√•str√∂m and Gunnar Ljungstedt. Ebba Gr√∂n went on to become one of the most successful punk bands in Swedish history. Eriksson was known for being the most aggressive member of the band and he also wrote some of the angriest, hardest songs, such as Pervers politiker (Perverted Politician) and Bev√§pna er (Arm Yourselves). He was a proclaimed anarchist and despised the government, the bourgeoisie and the Swedish monarchy. Fjodor was sometimes called Sweden‚Äôs Sid Vicious. In 1982, he was sentenced to jail for refusing to do military service. After escaping the prison he was transferred to a higher security penitentiary. This would be the end of Ebba Gr√∂n. Earlier, Eriksson had stated that he had grown bored of the constant touring with the band and missed the old days when they would just hang out in R√•gsved with their friends and write songs. Today, Lennart Eriksson lives on a self-contained farm on the island of Gotland off the east coast of Sweden, and works part-time as a chef. He has four children.

M. DeMatteis and artist Tom Sutton about a fictional character named Andrew Bennett. The character and storyline originally started as a backup story in House of Mystery between 1981 and 1983, but was popular enough to become the main feature. The I...Vampire finale was almost book length. Concept and creation J. M. DeMatteis pitched the series to editor Len Wein under the title \\"Greenberg\\". Wein liked the concept but rejected the title and suggested \\"I, Vampire\\" instead.  Fictional character biography (original series) In 1591, after being turned into a vampire himself, Lord Andrew Bennett turned his lover, Mary Seward, into a vampire, and she became corrupted by the power. She took the name Mary, Queen of Blood and created a group of vampires called the Blood Red Moon bent on taking over the world. The series followed Bennett into the modern day as he tried to undo his mistake and take down Mary and the Blood Red Moon. He was helped by his two companions Deborah Dancer, a beautiful young woman who Bennett saved from Mary at Woodstock (and who was also his girlfriend) and Dmitri Mishkin, a Russian man who Bennett rescued from Mary (and his own mother, turned by Mary) when Mishkin was a child. To try to keep his humanity, Bennett made a vow to only drink the blood of animals and bottled human blood (which created a subtext of alcoholism). In the original series, Bennett keeps his companions at arm's length, particularly Dancer. For a time he stays away from them altogether for fear of putting them in danger. Storylines included Mishkin's quest to find and destroy the vampire who was his mother, Bennett's pursuit of Mary through time periods leading back to a time before either of them were vampires (motivated on Mary's part by a desire to escape a strange disease killing vampires in the present), and finally an experimental 'cure' for vampirism which leads to the final confrontation between the surviving protagonists and Mary. =Later stories= Bennett has attempted suicide on several occasions to end his curse, and has also been brought back to life after each attempt due to a higher power, as seen in the 1988 run of Doctor Fate. During this run, we also see Andrew Bennett interact with the Lords of Chaos and Order to seek an end to time, which does occur due to the vampire's involvement but is later reversed. He also appeared in the 2005 miniseries Day of Vengeance as a background character in the Oblivion Bar, which became Shadowpact's headquarters. He appears as a supporting character in Doctor Thirteen backup stories in the 2006 miniseries Tales of the Unexpected.

Multiversity Comics. =Vampire lore= In the New 52 continuity, vampires possess the generic abilities associated with the undead, namely supernatural powers of strength and speed, immortality, and accelerated healing, as well as enhanced senses sufficient to track blood by scent, hear heartbeats, and see in the dark. Unlike their literary counterparts, however, these vampires are not burned from exposure to direct sunlight. Instead, sunlight dulls their senses and severely weakens their physical attributes to the point of becoming effectively human or even less so in terms of their abilities. These vampires trace their lineage to the Biblical Cain. After being exiled from Paradise and cursed with the mark for killing his brother Abel, Cain wandered a vast desert until he came across the first woman, Lilith. Consumed with bloodlust, he turned her out of sheer instinct. They have shown the ability to shapeshift to a greater extent than before, being able to become a variety of different forms, none of which have been completely defined. Vampires have also shown the ability to create clothes through shapeshifting. While all vampires can turn into wolves, Andrew has shown to be able to combine his wolf form with his natural 'human' form to create a monstrous werewolf-like creature. Andrew has also shown that he is able to change into a mist and back, being able to do this in combat as well to avoid strikes in the \\"nick of time\\" rendering him intangible. He has also shown to be able to mist all of his clothes as well as the weapon he was carrying. Andrew can also turn into a swarm of bats or sprout large bat wings from his back in order to achieve flight. In addition, Andrew also has the ability to \\"sway\\" humans to do his bidding and can alter their memories. After the events from Rise of the Vampires, Andrew can cast magic and do things like resurrect people and vampires,I, Vampire #8. DC Comics. freeze his enemies, and absorb dark magic,I, Vampire #12. DC Comics. among other things. Besides his vampiric powers, Andrew has been shown to be an expert tracker and master swordsman with unparalleled combat skills.

It is the first film in Kitano's surrealist autobiographical trilogy, being followed by Glory to the Filmmaker!, and Achilles and the Tortoise. Film structure The original working title of Takeshis was Fractal,Rayns, Tony, Takeshis', retrieved from the site of BFI London Film Festival. suggesting the film's structure. The film has nested story-lines and depicts an 8¬Ω-like identity crisis theme in autobiographical style. It is also strongly characterised by a series of surrealistic motifs linked by chance encounters. A prominent theme of the film is duality, as almost all the main characters appear in two forms or roles. Although it is hard to lay one's finger on the interpretation of this film, it can be said that self- actualization is at least a major underlying theme. Plot Takeshis progresses through the nested storyline of the dual protagonists, Beat Takeshi and Mr. Kitano (both played by Kitano himself). Beat Takeshi, a prominent actor, meets a look-alike named Mr. Kitano, who is a struggling actor. After the meeting, Mr. Kitano's dreams take a violent, surreal turn. The film opens with a nightmare vision. American soldiers with carbines move down the fallen base filled up with bodies of Japanese combatants. One of dying combatants appears to be (Beat or Kitano) Takeshi. This opening scene is followed by the gun battle of a yakuza film where one of the protagonists, 'Beat' Takeshi, plays the principal role. Flashbacks of this gun battle are frequently used throughout the film. 'Beat' Takeshi is a showbiz star. He lives through business in film studio and TV stations where main casts appear in one of their dual roles (Takeshi's Girlfriend (Kotomi Kyono), Takeshi's Manager (Ren Osugi), and Takeshi's former partner of stand-up comedy (Susumu Terajima)). The first appearance sequence of 'Beat' Takeshi also introduces some repetitive motives of Takeshis. (The caterpillar in a bouquet, a female impersonator of taish≈´ engeki (Taichi Saotome), tap dancers in a rehearsal set, Akihiro Miwa (a transvestite chanson singer), a pair of fat twins, and dialogs at a ramen restaurant repeated later in varied situations.) Mr. Kitano, the other protagonist, appears in a clown costume among the guys in a wardrobe of TV station. Mr. Kitano is an everyman, obsessed with his appearance identical to 'Beat' Takeshi. When two Takeshis encounter for the first time, Mr. Kitano seeks his heartthrob charisma's autograph. 'Beat' Takeshi gives the autograph to him. Kitano, earning a living as a convenience store clerk, never gets ahead as an actor. He begins to fantasize himself as 'Beat' Takeshi in daydreams. Fragments of surreal dream crosses over into his life. We see bizarre things accompanied by dead bodies on the road while he is moonlighting as a taxi driver. Kitano then happens to pick up a gun at a yakuza quarrel. He shoots first his yakuza neighbor (Susumu Terajima), and begins to kill people around his world. The film implies it is some kind of a dream, showing deceased guys appear again in blood and yell alive normally. Kitano takes out his female neighbor (Kotomi Kyono) and commits a bank robbery. Accomplishing his fantasies of acting like a movie star 'Beat' Takeshi, Kitano takes a journey into the absolutely bizarre, surreal world (an underground nightclub, night gun battles, and the catastrophe at a Boiling Point-, or Sonatine-like tropical island). Cut suddenly back to Kitano's real life where he is still confused himself and 'Beat' Takeshi. He finds the movie star's autograph greeting, \\"Hello Mr. Clown!\\". It triggers 'Beat' Takeshi's assassination by Mr. Kitano. Cut suddenly again back to a close-up of 'Beat' Takeshi, which implies all of the film might be a dream of 'Beat' Takeshi. The film ends with flashback images of an American Soldier and the gun battle of a yakuza film at the beginning.

It has been lauded as both an achievement of surreal comedy and a work of considerable editorial complexity. Reviews \\"Kitano's trilogy of parts aside, there's a bevy of other doppelgangers, mirror images and dead-ringers rife throughout this movie,\\" reported the Daily Yomiuri in its review in 2005. \\"Kotomi Kyono, while a tad dull as the movie star Takeshi's girlfriend, bears more than just costume jewellery sparkle in her ulterior role as a glitzy, ditsy yakuza girlfriend who happens to be the deadbeat Takeshi's tormenting neighbor.\\"Takeshis movie review, Andrez Bergen.

The island is entirely owned by Sir Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin Group, and is part of the Virgin Limited Edition portfolio of luxury properties. The whole island operates as a resort and can accommodate up to 30 guests, with additional room for six children. Location Necker Island is located at latitude 18.55 north and longitude 64.35 west in the eastern section of the British Virgin Islands. It is about north of Virgin Gorda and north-east of Prickly Pear Island and also Mosquito Island (sometimes spelled Moskito Island), which is also owned by Branson. The British Virgin Islands (BVI) are a group of islands about south-east of Miami, Florida, due east of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and about north-west of St. Barts. History The island was named after the 17th-century Dutch squadron commander Jonathan de Neckere.Hoetink, Hendrik Richard (1969). Encyclopedie van de Nederlandse Antillen. Amsterdam: Elsevier, p. 227. It remained uninhabited until the late 20th century. In 1965, the photographer Don McCullin and journalist Andrew Alexander, spent 15 days on the island at the behest of The Daily Telegraph newspaper for which they worked. The magazine editor had hoped that they would survive their castaway adventure for at least three weeks, but as McCullin later recounted, \\"because of our gathering weakness ... out of temper, and out of water, we hoisted the red flag and were taken off in the early hours of the fifteenth day\\". According to McCullin, there was nothing idyllic about the desert island: \\"The mosquitos and other insects were more venomous and persistent than any I had encountered in Vietnam or the Congo.\\"  Notable events  Wendell Brown (left) and Richard Branson (right) on Necker Island at Branson's Extreme Tech event, 2017 Richard Branson's Extreme Tech Challenge has been hosted annually at Necker Island since 2015. Described as one of the largest technology competitions in the world, the challenge begins at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas with the top 10 new innovations progressing to the finals at Necker Island where Branson joins the judging panel along with technology figures and investors from Silicon Valley. The Necker Cup, an exhibition tennis tournament held at the end of the tennis season, has been held on the island annually since 2012.2013 Necker Cup Pro-Am Tennis Tournament by Premier Tennis Travel, 2013 Necker Cup, the world's most exclusive Pro-Am tennis event In February 2017, former U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle visited Necker as guests of Branson. On 22 August 2011, The Great House burned down in a blaze believed to be caused by lightning from Tropical Storm Irene. At the time the house was occupied by as many as twenty guests, with Branson himself staying in a residence nearby. All of the guests escaped unhurt from the burning house, which was totally destroyed. Among the twenty occupants were actress Kate Winslet, Branson's 87-year-old mother Eve and his 29-year-old daughter Holly. The Great House was subsequently rebuilt with an expanded Great Room. On 6 September 2017, Hurricane Irma, a category 5 hurricane, made landfall on Necker Island destroying most of the island. Branson was quoted as saying \\"I have never seen anything like this hurricane. Necker and the whole area have been completely and utterly devastated\\". By April 2018, most of the damaged structures had been rebuilt. Land ownership by Richard Branson Richard Branson was made aware that some of the islands in the British Virgin Islands were for sale in 1978. Branson soon after went to the British Virgin Islands for a holiday to investigate the prospective real estate. On first observing the islands, he envisioned using them to put up rock stars for his record label. Upon arrival, they were given a luxury villa and travelled around islands for sale by helicopter. The final island he saw was Necker Island, and after climbing the hill and being stunned by the view and wildlife, decided to purchase the island. After making a lowball bid of $100,000 for the island (due to his relatively modest funds at that time in his career), he was turned down and escorted back to the mainland. A year later, the owner, John Lyttelton, 11th Viscount Cobham, in need of short-term capital, eventually settled for $120,000. However, the government imposed a restriction on alien landholders: that the new owner had to develop a resort within four years or the island would revert to the state. Branson committed to building a resort on the island. When Branson bought the island, it was uninhabited. He purchased the island at the age of 28, just six years after starting Virgin Group. It took three years and some $10 million to turn it into a private island retreat. Using local stone, Brazilian hardwoods, Asian antiques, Indian rugs, art pieces and fabrics and bamboo furniture from Bali, architects and designers created a ten-bedroom Balinese-style villa at the top of a hill above the beach. Each of the ten bedrooms has open walls, giving a 360-degree view. The island has accommodation for 40 people and rents out in total at US$102,500 per day. The cost of staying includes access to two beaches, private pools, tennis courts, scenic views, a personal chef, a team of about 100 staff and a wide array of water sports equipment.Richard Branson's treasure island where world's richest celebrities holiday, CNN, 2014-08-21. accessed 2015-05-15.Necker Island prices, accessed 2015-05-15.

Mount Ebal is approximately in area, and is composed primarily of limestone.Cheyne and Black, Encyclopedia Biblica The slopes of the mountain contain several large caverns which were probably originally quarries, and at the base towards the north are several tombs.Jewish Encyclopedia Biblical account In advance of the Israelites' entry to the Promised Land, records Moses' direction that \\"when the Lord your God has brought you into the land which you go to possess, that you shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal\\". In the masoretic text and the Septuagint version of Deuteronomy 27, an instruction is given to build an altar on Mount Ebal, constructed from natural (rather than cut) stones, to place stones there and whiten them with lime, to make peace offerings on the altar, eat there, and write the words of this law on the stone. According to the Samaritan Pentateuch and a Qumran fragment, this instruction actually concerns Mount Gerizim, which the Samaritans view as a holy site;' some scholars believe that the Samaritan version is probably more accurate in this respect, the compilers of the masoretic text and authors of the Septuagint being likely to be biased against the Samaritans. Recent Dead Sea Scrolls work supports the accuracy of the Samaritan Pentateuch's designation of Mount Gerizim rather than Mount Ebal as the sacred site.Charlesworth, James H. The Discovery of an Unknown Dead Sea Scroll: The Original Text of Deuteronomy 27? OWU Magazine; 2012/07/16 An instruction immediately subsequent to this orders that, once this is done, the Israelites should split into two groups, one to stay on Mount Ebal and pronounce curses, while the other goes to Mount Gerizim and pronounces blessings.Deuteronomy 27:11-13 The tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin were to be sent to Gerizim, while those of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan and Naphtali, were to remain on Ebal. No attempts to explain this division of tribes either by their Biblical ethnology or by their geographical distribution have been generally accepted in academic circles.Peake's commentary on the Bible More recently, however, some argue that the tribes were divided as equally as possible given the population's census data given in the Book of Numbers. Specifically, the division found in the book of Deuteronomy is the most equal out of 462 possible divisions. The text goes on to list twelve curses, which were to be pronounced by the Levite priesthood and answered by the people with Amen.Deuteronomy 15-26 These curses heavily resemble laws (e.g. cursed be he who removes his neighbour's landmark), and they are not followed by a list of blessings described in a similarly liturgical framework; scholars believe that these more likely represent what was written on the stones, and that the later list of six explicit blessings,Deuteronomy 28:3-6 six near-corresponding explicit curses,Deuteronomy 28:16-19 were originally in this position in the text. The present position of these explicit blessings and curses, within a larger narrative of promise, and a far larger narrative of threat (respectively), is considered to have been an editorial decision for the post-exilic second version of Deuteronomy (Dtr2), to reflect the deuteronomist's worldview after the Babylonian exile had occurred. In the Book of Joshua, after the Battle of Ai, Joshua built an altar of unhewn stones there, the Israelites then made peace offerings on it, the Law of Moses was written onto the stones, and the Israelites split into the two groups specified in Deuteronomy and pronounced blessings and cursings as instructed there.Joshua 8:31-35 There is some debate between textual scholars as to whether this incident in Joshua is one account or spliced together two different accounts, where one account refers to Joshua building an altar, and making sacrifices on it, while the other account refers to Joshua placing large stone slabs there that had been whitened with lime and then had the Torah inscribed on them.Jewish Encyclopedia Either way there is general agreement that the sources of Joshua predate Deuteronomy, and hence that the order to build the altar and make the inscription is likely based on these actions in the sources of Joshua, rather than the other way round, possibly to provide an aetiology for the site acceptable to the deuteronomist's theology.Richard Elliott Friedman, Who wrote the Bible; Jewish Encyclopedia, Book of Joshua, Deuteronomy Much later in the Book, when Joshua was old and dying, he gathered the people together at Shechem, and gave a farewell speech, and then wrote these words in the book of the Torah of God, and took a great stone, and set it under the doorpost which is in the sanctuary of the Lord.Joshua 24:1-27 Depending on the way in which the sources of Joshua were spliced together, this may just be another version of the earlier narrative Joshua placing the whitened stones slabs with the Torah inscribed on them, and some scholars believe that this narrative may have originally been in an earlier location within the Book of Joshua. In the Biblical narrative, the terebinth, seemingly next to the sanctuary, was evidently in existence as early as the time of the Patriarchs, as Jacob is described in the Book of Genesis as having buried the idols of strange gods (belonging to his uncle Laban) beneath it.Genesis 35:4 According to a midrash, one of these idols, in the shape of a dove, was later recovered by the Samaritans, and used in their worship on Mount Gerizim.Jewish Encyclopedia Archaeology The higher part of the mountain, on the west, contains the ruins of some massive walls called Al-Kal'ah, and east of this are other ruins now called Kunaisah. However, potentially much more significant remains have been found on the northern side. Like many other sites in the region, by the 20th century there was a large stone heap found on Mount Ebal; this one was known to locals as el Burnat (Arabic for the Hat), and was found by Adam Zertal, within a naturally shaped amphitheatre.Matthew Sturgis, It Ain't Necessarily So, Upon archaeological investigation, several potsherds were found among this heap, and were dated to 1220‚Äì1000 BC, a date for which no other remains are found nearby, and so a more substantial archaeological excavation was launched at the site in 1987. The excavation found a large walled structure, seemingly built direct into the bedrock without a doorway or floor, and had been infilled by layers of stone, ash, and earth; on the southwest were found two paved areas split apart by a further wide wall higher at one end than the other and with a surrounding oval wall. Slowly burnt bones were found at the site, and after analysis were discovered to originate from bullocks, goats, and fallow deer. Although the excavating archaeologist believed that the site was the compound containing Joshua's altar, the filled walled structure being the altar itself ‚Äì the filling being a part of the altar rather than debris (and indicative of an Assyrian style altar, like that specified in the Book of Exodus as being hollow with boardsExodus 27) ‚Äì and the wall between the two courtyards being a ramp (in accordance with the no steps instruction in ExodusExodus 26), most other archaeologists believe it to be something else. The site has a significant issue in regard to the Biblical account of Joshua's altar, as it is located on the north side of the mountain, and not the south side facing Mount Gerizim, making a curse & blessing ritual held there and on Gerizim somewhat difficult to hold antiphonally; the excavating archaeologist proposed that this could be resolved by identifying a mountain to the north as Gerizim rather than the usual location, though the suggestion was ridiculed by both the Samaritans, who found it offensive to move the centre of their religion, and by other scholars and archaeologists. Though some archaeologists agree with the consideration that the site was an altar compound (though not constructed by Joshua), and some (including Israel Finkelstein) at least agree that it was a cultic location (though not necessarily involving an altar), others believe that it was simply a farmhouse, a guard towerAssaf Kamar, 'A rare visit to the supposed altar of prophet Joshua,' Ynet 9 August 2016. or the Biblical tower of Shechem. Those considering it to be a farmhouse and/or the tower of Shechem, argue that the paved areas are simply rooms, the sloping wall simply an eroded partition wall, and the infilled enclosure a room that was later changed into a tower ‚Äì the foundation of the tower being the infill, and the rest of the tower now destroyed. Israelis wishing to visit the site today must coordinate their activity with COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry unit which manages civilian affairs for Palestinians in the West Bank and liaises with Gaza, since Mount Ebal is located in what is now designated as Area B. In addition, Israeli citizens visiting the area are required to be escorted by IDF soldiers, to ensure their personal safety. The Shomron Regional Council, as of July 2016, was trying to promote the area as a tourist destination.

Historical background Throughout the centuries, two tendencies have influenced the role of the military in national life, one in peacetime and the other in times of upheaval. In times of peace and stability, military forces were firmly subordinated to civilian control. The military was strong enough to overcome domestic rebellions and foreign invasion, yet it did not threaten civilian control of the political system. In times of disorder, however, new military leaders and organizations arose to challenge the old system, resulting in the militarization of political life. When one of these leaders became strong enough, he established a new political order ruling all China. After consolidating power, the new ruler or his successors subordinated the military to civilian control once again.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2006. . Retrieved March 12, 2011. p.49-52 Since the 1960s, China had considered the Soviet Union the principal threat to its security; lesser threats were posed by long standing border disputes with Vietnam and India. China's territorial claims and economic interests made the South China Sea an area of strategic importance to China. Although China sought peaceful reunification of Taiwan with the mainland China, it did not rule out the use of force against the island if serious internal disturbances, a declaration of independence, or a threatening alliance occurred.Kissinger, H. On China, Penguin, New York, p.346 Before the founding of the People's Republic of China Flag of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (‰∏≠ÂúãÂ∑•Ëæ≤Á¥ÖËªç). The divisions of the \\"Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\\" (‰∏≠ÂúãÂ∑•Ëæ≤Á¥ÖËªç) were named according to historical circumstances, sometimes in a nonconsecutive way. Early Communist units often formed by defection from existing Kuomintang forces, keeping their original designations. Moreover, during the Chinese Civil War, central control of separate Communist-controlled enclaves within China was limited, adding to the confusion of nomenclature of Communist forces. By the time of the 1934 Long March, numerous small units had been organized into three unified groups, the First Front Red Army (Á¥Ö‰∏ÄÊñπÈù¢Ëªç/Á∫¢‰∏ÄÊñπÈù¢ÂÜõ/H√≥ng Yƒ´ FƒÅngmi√†n J≈´n), the Second Front Red Army (Á¥Ö‰∫åÊñπÈù¢Ëªç/Á∫¢‰∫åÊñπÈù¢ÂÜõ/H√≥ng √àr FƒÅngmi√†n J≈´n) and the Fourth Front Red Army (Á¥ÖÂõõÊñπÈù¢Ëªç/Á∫¢ÂõõÊñπÈù¢ÂÜõ/H√≥ng S√¨ FƒÅngmi√†n J≈´n), also translated as \\"First Front Red Army\\", \\"Second Front Red Army\\" and \\"Fourth Front Red Army\\".Peoples Liberation Army Daily (August 14, 2006) Notes Retrieved 2007-02-17 Mao's military thought grew out of the Red Army's experiences in the late 1930s and early 1940s and formed the basis for the \\"people's war\\" concept, which became the doctrine of the Red Army and the PLA. In developing his thought, Mao drew on the works of the Chinese military strategist Sun Zi (4th century BC) and Soviet and other theorists, as well as on the lore of peasant uprisings, such as the stories found in the classical novel Shuihu Zhuan (Water Margin) and the stories of the Taiping Rebellion. Synthesizing these influences with lessons learned from the Red Army's successes and failures, Mao created a comprehensive politico- military doctrine for waging revolutionary warfare. People's war incorporated political, economic, and psychological measures with protracted military struggle against a superior foe. As a military doctrine, people's war emphasized the mobilization of the populace to support regular and guerrilla forces; the primacy of men over weapons, with superior motivation compensating for inferior technology; and the three progressive phases of protracted warfare‚Äîstrategic defensive, strategic stalemate, and strategic offensive (see Mobile Warfare). During the first stage, enemy forces were \\"lured in deep\\" into one's own territory to overextend, disperse, and isolate them. The Red Army established base areas from which to harass the enemy, but these bases and other territory could be abandoned to preserve Red Army forces. In addition, policies ordered by Mao for all soldiers to follow, the Eight Points of Attention, instructed the army to avoid harm to or disrespect for the peasants, regardless of the need for food and supplies. This policy won support for the Communists among the rural peasants.Indo-Asian News Service (October 22, 2006): Retracing Mao's Long March (Retrieved 23 November 2006) On January 15, 1949, the Communist Party Central Military Commission decided to reorganise the regional armies of the PLA into four field armies.Historical Dictionary of Modern China (1800-1949), James Zheng Gao, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , 116 People's Republic of China = Border disputes in the 1970s = In January 1974, the PLA saw action in the South China Sea following a long-simmering dispute with the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) over the Paracel Islands. The PLA successfully seized control of three disputed islands in a naval battle and a subsequent amphibious assault. A Sino-Vietnamese War revealed specific shortcomings in military capabilities and thus provided an additional impetus to the military modernization effort. The border war, the PLA's largest military operation since the Korean War, was essentially a limited, offensive, ground-force campaign. The war had mixed results militarily and politically. Although the numerically superior Chinese forces penetrated about fifty kilometers into Vietnam, the PLA was not on good terms with its supply lines and was unable to achieve a decisive victory in the war. Both China and Vietnam claimed victory. = Military modernization in the 1980s = In 1981, the PLA conducted its largest military exercise in North China since the founding of the People's Republic of China. In 1985, Deng Xiaoping announced that the PLA would demobilize 1 million troops. On the other hand, border battles and skirmishes continued throughout the 1980s.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, Washington Nationals, and Texas Rangers. Professional career =Minnesota Twins= Guzm√°n was acquired by the Minnesota Twins in from the New York Yankees organization as part of the Chuck Knoblauch trade. In , Guzm√°n was named to the AL All-Star team and posted career bests with 10 home runs and a .302 batting average. He was a key part of the Twins teams that won three consecutive American League Central titles from ‚Äì. While a Twin, he led the American League in triples in (20), 2001 (14) and (14). His total of 20 in 2000 was only the tenth time a player had reached that number in the last 70 years. =Washington Nationals= After becoming a free agent, Guzm√°n signed a $16.8 million, four-year contract with the Washington Nationals for the season but then proceeded to have the worst year of his career. As the full-time shortstop, he was batting .192 at the end of August, but rallied in September, hitting .325, which helped bring his average up to .219. Three days after the disastrous 2005 season, Guzm√°n had eye surgery, which he credited as a prime reason for his resurgence in the following years. Guzm√°n was sidelined for the entire campaign with a shoulder injury and subsequent surgery, but returned in as the Nationals' starting shortstop following the trade of second baseman Jos√© Vidro to the Seattle Mariners and the move of Felipe L√≥pez to second base. However, he injured his hamstring on the first day of the regular season. He was on the disabled list until May 7, 2007. Batting leadoff, he was hitting .329 (second on the team), and despite missing almost half of the season through late June, was third in the league with six triples. On June 24, however, Guzm√°n was injured while tagging out a would-be base-stealer, and had surgery the next day to repair a torn thumb ligament, sidelining him for the rest of the 2007 season. On March 30, , Guzm√°n got the first hit in the history of Nationals Park, a broken bat single to right off Atlanta Braves starter Tim Hudson. He followed with the first run in the history of the park, after an RBI double by Nick Johnson. He made the NL All-Star team as the Nationals' lone representative in 2008. He ended up playing third base in the All-Star Game, and made some crucial fielding plays at that position, even though he had previously only played shortstop as a major leaguer. On August 28, 2008, Guzm√°n hit for the cycle against the Los Angeles Dodgers; only the second cycle in Nationals history. Guzman signed a two-year contract extension to stay with the Nats. He finished the 2008 season as 4th the league in hits and batting average.https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/g/guzmacr01.shtml By the All-Star break in 2009, he was fourth among active players for triples.https://www.baseball- reference.com/leaders/3B_active.shtml He had the lowest fielding percentage of any starting major league shortstop in 2009 (.962).\\"MLB Player Fielding Stats ‚Äì As ss ‚Äì 2009\\" ESPN, accessed October 6, 2009 =Texas Rangers= On July 31, 2010, the Texas Rangers acquired Guzm√°n from the Nationals for two minor leaguers, Tanner Roark and Ryan Tatusko.http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100730&content;_id=12809524&vkey;=tradedeadline2010&fext;=.jsp&c;_id=mlb Guzman played his first game as a Ranger on August 1 against the Angels in L.A. and went 0‚Äì3 with a walk. =2011= Although Guzm√°n received spring training invitations from two teams, he was forced to miss at least the first half of the season to deal with unspecified family issues. =Cleveland Indians= Guzm√°n signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians on February 21, 2012. After suffering a strained hamstring during spring training, he was released by the Indians on March 28.

A work of a lifetime's study and understanding of the human condition, in psychological terms, Browne's last major work may be considered as advice on obtaining individuation and self- realization as much as Christian virtue.

Apart from brief scenes, it is set in and around Belfast in the Troubles. Its lead actors were Ray Lonnen, Derek Thompson and Benjamin Whitrow. The drama is noted for its closing music by the Irish musical group Clannad titled \\"Theme from Harry's Game\\" used in trailers and later commercially released, reaching the top five of Irish and British singles charts, bringing the band its first major international exposure. The drama, filmed in West Yorkshire, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has been released under five other names in other countries. Synopsis The British government cabinet minister Henry Danby is murdered by an IRA gunman, Billy Downes, in front of his wife and children outside his home in London. Downes then escapes to Belfast and army officer Harry Brown is sent undercover into Belfast's Catholic community to track down the assassin. Brown is chosen for the mission because he is an Ulsterman who has previously done similar work in Oman. Given the cover identity of merchant seaman Harry McEvoy, he finds lodgings in the Falls Road area and secures a job in a scrapyard. He dates a Catholic, Josephine Laverty, and unknowingly encounters Downes in a local club, which is raided by the British Army. A British soldier recognises Harry but ignores him and arrests Downes, who is interrogated but set free. Harry tips off his superiors that the killer was at the club and that Theresa, a girl at whose family home Billy stayed the night while on the run, knows his name. Theresa is arrested, but caught between the police interrogator Rennie and her fear of the IRA if she talks, she hangs herself in prison before revealing Downes' identity. When Josephine realises that Harry must have passed on the information about Theresa, she tells him to leave while he can, but he refuses, saying Danby's killer cannot be allowed to get away with the murder. A waiter overhears two army officers discussing Harry's presence in Belfast while eating at his restaurant. He reports Harry's presence to the IRA, and the local IRA boss starts checking all new arrivals, including Harry. The IRA start to hunt Harry down. With two other gunmen, Downes ambushes Harry, who shoots the gunmen and forces a passing driver to chase their car as Downes escapes. Harry follows Downes to his own home, which is under surveillance by the army. Harry shoots Downes in the street in front of his wife and is himself shot by the soldiers watching the house, who think that he is a terrorist. Injured and bleeding in the street, Harry is confronted by Downes's wife, who then shoots him in the head using Harry's own revolver. The film closes with a narrator reading a part of a poem written by the daughter of an IRA victim (William Staunton, a 46-year-old British magistrate shot dead by the IRA on 25 January 1973, near Saint Dominic's School, Falls Road): \\"Don't cry, Mummy said. They're not real, but Daddy was, and he's not here. Don't be bitter, Mummy said. They've hurt themselves much more. They can walk and run, Daddy can't.\\" Cast * Ray Lonnen as Harry Brown * Benjamin Whitrow as Davidson * Nicholas Day as Bannen * Geoffrey Chater as Col. George Frost * Sean Caffrey as Insp. Howard Rennie * Derek Thompson as Billy Downes Production =Locations= Most of the time filming was spent in Leeds, in Yorkshire, England, on now-demolished housing of Meanwood and at Leeds Studios. This stood in for Northern Ireland. The rest of footage, filmed west of the Irish Sea, includes shots of the Falls Road, broader views as where Harry is frisked on entry to Belfast city centre (there was a permanent checkpoint for pedestrians there for many years) and the final scenes overlooking the cityscape were in Holywood, County Down and close to the military/MI5 barracks. Scenes were also filmed in the south of County Dublin including in Ballybrack. =Music= Clannad's closing music became an international breakthrough. Incidental music was sampled or created by Mike Moran. Broadcast and distribution history The series screened on the ITV network as three 52-to-54 minute episodes over consecutive nights from 25 to 27 October 1982, and was later edited into a single 130-minute programme titled Harry's Game - The Movie. ;Outside of Britain and Ireland *The film was not widely seen in the US or widely available on video; sold in Canada titled Belfast Assassin.

The exhaustion doctrine, also referred to as the first sale doctrine,The term \\"exhaustion doctrine\\" is used in patent cases. The term \\"first sale doctrine\\" is used in copyright cases. Compare Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc. (patent) with Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (copyright). is a U.S. common law patent doctrine that limits the extent to which patent holders can control an individual article of a patented product after a so-called authorized sale. Under the doctrine, once an authorized sale of a patented article occurs, the patent holder's exclusive rights to control the use and sale of that article are said to be \\"exhausted,\\" and the purchaser is free to use or resell that article without further restraint from patent law. However, under the repair and reconstruction doctrine, the patent owner retains the right to exclude purchasers of the articles from making the patented invention anew (i.e., making another article), unless it is specifically authorized by the patentee to do so.See, e.g., Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476 (1964); Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U.S. 336 (1961); Morgan Envelope Co. v. Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper Co., 152 U.S. 425 (1894); Cotton-Tie Co. v. Simmons, 106 U.S. 89 (1882). See also Wilbur-Ellis Co. v. Kuther, 377 U.S. 422 (1964) (purchaser may modify article to improve or alter functionality). Procedurally, the patent exhaustion doctrine operates as an affirmative defense, shielding authorized purchasers from infringement claims concerning the sale or use (including repair and modification) of a patented product after the patent owner authorized its sale. Because only an \\"authorized\\" sale triggers the doctrine, it may be difficult or at least controversial to determine whether the exhaustion doctrine applies in a particular case: for example, when the patentee purports to restrict or condition the use or resale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user (post-sale restrictions); or when the patentee licenses another to manufacture and use or sell the patented product only in a particular field. The 2008 Supreme Court decision in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., arguably leaves unclear the extent to which patentees can avoid the exhaustion doctrine by means of so-called limited licenses (licenses limited to a specified field of use). Since its development by the courts in the late 19th century,See Adams v. Burke, 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453 (1873). the patent exhaustion doctrine has raised questions regarding the scope of exclusive rights granted by patents and the extent to which a patent owner may extend those rights to control downstream use and sales of patented articles.  Overview  A patent gives the patent owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing into the U.S. the patented invention (i.e., a product embodying the invention) during the term of the patent.35 U.S.C. ¬ß 271(a)(2006). The constitutional rationale behind providing these exclusive rights is to \\"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts\\"U.S. Const., art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 8 by providing inventors the incentive to invest their time, labor, and funds in researching and developing innovative technology.William M. Landes & Richard A. Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law 294 (2003). Providing these protections, however, comes with social costs (monopoly rents) and limits the public's ability to freely alienate patented goods. Thus, public policy dictates that the patent owner's exclusive rights be limited in scope. Generally, when a patent owner receives compensation for the use of his or her invention through sale of a patented product, the purpose of patent law is fulfilled with respect to that product.See, e.g., Keeler v. Standard Folding Bed Co., 157 U.S. 659, 666-67 (1895) (\\"The conclusion reached does not deprive a patentee of his just rights, because no article can be unfettered from the claim of his monopoly without paying its tribute. The inconvenience and annoyance to the public that an opposite conclusion would occasion are too obvious to require illustration.\\"). Upon receiving compensation, the patent owner's rights to exclude others are exhausted and \\"the patent law affords no basis for restraining the use and enjoyment of the thing sold.\\"United States v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U.S. 241, 251 (1942). Accordingly, a patent owner's voluntary introduction of a patented product into commerce without restriction prevents the patent owner from exercising any claimed right to exclude others from using or reselling the sold product.Exhaustion occurs also when a product is given away. Lifescan Scotland, Ltd. v. Shasta Technologies, 734 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Unlike the analogous first-sale doctrine in copyright, the patent exhaustion doctrine has not been codified into the patent statute, and is thus still a common law doctrine. It was first explicitly recognized by the Supreme Court in 1873 in Adams v. Burke.84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453 (1873). The Adams decision referred to earlier 19th century decisions whose language supported the proposition, but in slightly different contexts. In Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., a 2013 copyright decision, the Supreme Court termed the exhaustion principle \\"a common-law doctrine with an impeccable historic pedigree,\\" and cited 15th and 17th century exhaustion precedents. In that case, the patentee Adams assigned to another the right to make, use, and sell patented coffin lids only within a ten-mile radius of Boston. Burke (an undertaker), a customer of the assignee, bought the coffin lids from the manufacturer-assignee within the ten-mile radius, but later used (and effectively resold) the patented coffin lids outside of the ten-mile radius, in his trade in the course of burying a person. The patentee Adams sued the undertaker Burke for patent infringement, but the Supreme Court found no infringement liability: Once the coffin lids were lawfully made and sold, \\"there is no restriction on their use to be implied for the benefit of the patentee or his assignees or licensees.\\" Because the sale was authorized (bought from an authorized seller within the ten-mile radius), the defendant acquired the right to use the coffin lids free from any claim of the patentee, even though he carried it outside the ten-mile radius to use it. Limitations The exhaustion doctrine is triggered only by a sale authorized by the patent holder.United States v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U.S. at 249. Thus, there are circumstances where it may be difficult to determine whether the exhaustion doctrine is triggered, in light of restrictions that the patentee has purported to place on the sale or use of the patented invention. Two general questions arise in these situations: (1) Was the sale authorized by the patentee? This can often be a complex factual question. (2) Regardless of whether authorized by the patentee, are those restrictions valid and recognizable under the law? Generally, these cases involve one or more of the following scenarios: the patent owner: (1) sells one or more components of a multi-component patented product;See, e.g., United States v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U.S. 241 (1942) (sale of incomplete lens blank embodying essential features of invention exhausts patent rights in finished, patented lens); Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, 309 U.S. 436 (1940) (sale of fuel additive exhausts patent rights in fuel). (2) licenses another to make and sell patented product with certain restrictions on field in which the sale may be made;See, e.g., General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Elec. Co., 304 U.S. 175, 179 (1937) (license limited to making and selling in \\"noncommercial\\" field held effective). or (3) sells the article with restrictions directly on the purchasers or end-users (post-sale restraint).See, e.g., Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 553 U.S. 617 (2008) (holding \\"downstream\\" restraint legally ineffective).; Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc., 976 F.2d 700 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (permitting post-sale restraint). =Sale of incomplete articles= One scenario in which the exhaustion doctrine may or may not be triggered is when the patent holder sells an incomplete article or precursor or ingredient that does not directly practice or embody the patent in suit. In this situation, exhaustion is triggered by the authorized sale of the incomplete article if: (1) its \\"only reasonable and intended use was to practice the patent, and (2) it \\"embodies essential features\\" of the patented invention.See, e.g., United States v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U.S. 241 (1942); Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 553 U.S. 617, 631-32 (2008). Even if the exhaustion doctrine is applicable to the sale of an incomplete article, however, there is a separate analysis of whether the sale of that article was actually authorized, and therefore whether exhaustion was actually triggered.See, e.g., id. at 635-37 (first considering whether exhaustion applies, then separately analyzing whether the sale actually triggered exhaustion). The applicability of exhaustion to the sale of an incomplete article was recognized by the Supreme Court in 1942 in United States v. Univis Lens Co.. In that case, the patent holder sold lens blanks which had to be ground into finished lenses ‚Äî the patented invention. The Court held that this sale exhausted the patents on the finished lenses because the lens blanks substantially \\"embodi[ed] essential features of the patented device and [were] without utility until . . . ground and polished as the finished lens of the patent.\\"Univis, 316 U.S. at 249. The Court noted that the grinding process was standard (conventional) and not central to the patents, indicating further that the lens blanks constituted a material part of the patented invention and all but completely practiced the patent, since only conventional further processing steps were needed to complete the invention. In Quanta, the Supreme Court applied the same test to determine whether exhaustion is triggered by the licensing of a portfolio of product and method patents. In that case, the patent holder (LGE) authorized the licensee (Intel) by cross-license to manufacture and sell microprocessors and chipsets that (unless licensed) would infringe LGE product and method patents, as well as patents on computer systems containing the licensed microprocessors and chipsets. The Court found that, even though these Intel products did not directly practice the system patents, they sufficiently embodied the inventions of those patents, making the exhaustion doctrine applicable. First, the Court found that there was no reasonable use for the Intel products other than incorporating them into a computer system that practiced the LGE system patents.Quanta, 553 U.S. at 631-32. Second, the Intel products embodied essential features of the patented processes because the only necessary step to practice the patents was the addition of such standard computer parts as memories and buses.Id. at 632-33. In addition, there was nothing inventive about the systems other than that they contained the inventive microprocessors and chipsets.Under present U.S. patent law it is possible to obtain a patent on a superset of elements simply because a subset within it is patentable. See Richard H. Stern, Quanta Computer Inc v LGE Electronics Inc‚ÄîComments on the Reaffirmance of the Exhaustion Doctrine in the United States, [2008] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 527, 529-30. See also Exhausted combination doctrine. Thus, under the Univis test, the Intel products sufficiently embodied the patents, making the exhaustion doctrine applicable. =Limitations on sale= Another scenario in which it may be difficult to determine if the sale of a patented article was authorized, and therefore if exhaustion is triggered, occurs when the patentee grants a license to make and sell with specific limitations on the field in which the seller may operate, such as sales to particular types of customer, specified territories, or other field-of-use limitations. If these limitations (or \\"restrictions\\") have been imposed, the licensee's sale to a purchaser exhausts only the patentee's rights to restrict use and resale when the restrictions have not been exceeded (\\"violated\\").Technically, the terms \\"restrict\\" and \\"violate\\" are inappropriate in the context of such field-of-use limitations pursuant to the General Talking Pictures doctrine, because the Supreme Court has held that the presence of a field-of-use limitation does not imply a promise not to exceed the field limitation without a further, special promise to that effect. Automatic Radio Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 339 U.S. 827, 836 (1950) (\\"This limited license for 'home' use production contains neither an express nor implied agreement to refrain from production for 'commercial' or any other use as part consideration for the license grant.\\"). The theory is that if Alice owns Blackacre but not Whiteacre, she cannot convey good title to Bob by purporting to sell him Whiteacre. She can sell only what she owns.General Talking Pictures, 304 U.S, 175, 181 (\\"The Transformer Company could not convey to petitioner what both knew it was not authorized to sell.\\"). If the license limitations (\\"restrictions\\") are exceeded (\\"violated\\"), then exhaustion cannot occur and therefore is not triggered, and the patentee can successfully sue the licensee and any downstream customers for patent infringement.See, e.g., General Talking Pictures. The Supreme Court in General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co. has specifically upheld the legitimacy of field-of-use limitations in patent licenses to manufacture patented products. A licensee who exceeds (\\"violates\\") a field-of-use limitation by selling an article outside of the permissible field commits patent infringement. The exhaustion doctrine would provide no protection because the \\"violation\\" makes the sale \\"unauthorized\\" for the purposes of the exhaustion doctrine.See, e.g., General Talking Pictures, 304 U.S. at 181-82 (\\"The Transformer Company could not convey to petitioner what both knew it was not authorized to sell. By knowingly making the sales to petitioner outside the scope of its license, the Transformer Company infringed the patents embodied in the amplifiers.\\") (citations omitted). The field-of-use limitations on sale (those imposed on the licensee in selling the patented articles) are different from post-sale restrictions or limitations (those that purpose to restrict the use or sale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user). Patentees can avoid the exhaustion doctrine by imposing the former, but it is questionable that patentees can do so through the latter.Compare Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc. with Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.. A case in now pending before the Federal Circuit, to be reargued en banc, in which the court directed the parties to brief and argue the issue whether Quanta overruled Mallinckrodt. Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Impression Prods., Inc. , Nos. 2014-1617 and 1619, Order of Apr. 15, 2015. Limitations on sale must very explicitly bind the licensee or seller. For example, in Quanta, LGE licensed Intel to make products using LGE's patents. The license expressly stated that LGE was not licensing third parties to combine licensed products with any non-Intel products (i.e., microprocessors and chipsets purchased from a third party), and LGE required Intel to notify customers of that. Intel sold products to Quanta, who combined the Intel products with non-Intel products. LGE sued Quanta for patent infringement. The Supreme Court found that the licensing agreement failed to explicitly impose a field-of-use limitation, and therefore found that there were no conditions limiting to whom Intel could sell. The sale was thus \\"authorized,\\" and exhaustion was triggered. In the Court's words, \\"The License Agreement authorized Intel to sell products that practiced the patents. No conditions limited Intel's authority to sell products substantially embodying the patents. . . . Intel's authorized sale to Quanta thus took its products outside the scope of the patent monopoly, and as a result, LGE can no longer assert its patent rights against Quanta.\\"Quanta, 553 U.S. at 637. This point is discussed in Richard H. Stern, Quanta Computer Inc v LGE Electronics Inc ‚Äî Comments on the Reaffirmance of the Exhaustion Doctrine in the United States, [2008] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 527. Because the contractual documents in the Quanta case were insufficiently explicit, the Court applied the exhaustion doctrine, finding the sale \\"authorized\\" and unconditional, even though LGE attempted to impose some restrictions on use of the products. Therefore, purchasers of the patented product were free to use them without restrictions that the patentee sought to have imposed on them. The Court found that the licensing agreement did not impose any limitations on whom the licensee could sell to. The Quanta Court did not address, however, whether the restriction in the licensing agreement could be enforced by contract. In fact, the Court pointedly said it was not addressing that issue. =Post-sale limitations= The most difficult and unsettled area of the law regarding patent exhaustion involves cases in which a patentee purports to impose post-sale restrictions. Post-sale restrictions are those that purport to restrict the use or sale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user customer, rather than similar limitations on a manufacturer-licensee. Common post-sale restrictions include \\"single use only\\" and \\"refill only with proprietary ink\\" notices. Whether violations of such restrictions make a sale \\"unauthorized,\\" and therefore make patent exhaustion inapplicable, is still unclear or at least controversial.See, e.g., Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 553 U.S. 617 (2008). In 1992, the Federal Circuit approved the use of post-sale restrictions in Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.. Specifically, the court held that patent owners could condition the sale of patented goods with a restrictive notice and thereby restrict the disposition of the goods by the purchasers, with the exception of such antitrust law violations as price-fixing and tie-in restrictions, or violations of \\"some other law or policy.\\"976 F.2d 700, 708 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The plaintiff in the case owned a patent on a medical device, which it sold to hospitals with a \\"single use only\\" notice label. The defendant purchased the used devices from hospitals, refurbished them, and resold them to hospitals. The Federal Circuit held that the single-use restriction was enforceable in accordance with the 1926 General Electric case,United States v. General Electric Co., 272 U.S. 476 (1926). because the restriction was \\"reasonably within the patent grant. . . .\\"Id. at 708. The Supreme Court did not discuss the Mallinckrodt case in Quanta. As one commentator noted: \\"The Supreme Court, in Quanta, was widely expected to rule on whether Mallinckrodt was good law. But the Court sidestepped the issue by narrowly interpreting the license agreement so that it was not a conditional license. . . . Because the Supreme Court sidestepped the issue, it remains unclear to what extent a patentee can use a conditional license to impose restrictions on downstream purchasers.\\"Steven Seidenberg, Patent Predicament, Sept. 2008. At least two district courts have concluded that Mallinckrodt is no longer good law after Quanta.See Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc., 615 F. Supp. 2d 586 (E.D. Ky. 2009); accord Egrowerx Int'l, LLC v. Maxell Corp., 18 F. Supp. 3d 430 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\\"[A] majority of commentators have adopted the view that Quanta overturned the conditional sales doctrine.\\"). In Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc., the court concluded that the Supreme Court's Quanta decision implicitly overruled Mallinckrodt. At issue in Static Control was Lexmark's so called \\"prebate\\" program, in which customers could buy cartridges that were subject to a single use for a 20 percent discounted price. In its original order, before Quanta was decided, the court rejected Static Control's argument that Lexmark's patent rights were exhausted as a result of the authorized sale of the cartridges. Relying heavily on Mallinckrodt, the court found that the sales were valid post-sale restrictions that avoided exhaustion. After Quanta was decided, however, the court reversed its original order and concluded that Lexmark's single use restriction was not enforceable under patent law because the court was \\"persuaded that Quanta overruled Mallinckrodt sub silentio.\\"Id. at 585. The court explained, \\"The Supreme Court's broad statement of the law of patent exhaustion simply cannot be squared with the position that the Quanta holding is limited to its specific facts. Further, the Federal Circuit relied in part on Mallinckrodt in reaching its decision in LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc., 453 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the decision the Supreme Court reversed in Quanta. It is also worth noting that the Quanta decision did not mention a single Federal Circuit case.\\"Id. The district court's conclusion, however, that Quanta overruled Mallinckrodt reflects the ambiguity in Quanta itself. The Static Control court noted that \\"[s]ales of Lexmark Prebate cartridges were unconditional\\" because \\"[n]o potential buyer was required to agree to abide by the Prebate terms before purchasing a cartridge. Thus, sales of Lexmark's Prebate toner cartridges were authorized and unconditional, just like sales of LGE's patented products in Quanta.\\"Id. at 584. Therefore, both Quanta and Static Control can be seen as either cautionary talesSee Vincent Chiapetta, Patent Exhaustion: What's It Good For?, 51 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1087, 1089 (2011) (stating that some view Quanta as holding that the exhaustion doctrine \\"absolutely prohibits patent enforcement of post-sale conditions. Others view the decision as a cautionary tale, with exhaustion operating as a default contract term placing the burden on patent owners (and their lawyers) to incorporate any waiver explicitly into the sale agreement. Many practitioners and scholars, myself included, are not sure what the correct interpretation may be.\\"). about failed attempts to comply with the General Talking Pictures doctrineActually, Lexmark could not have complied with the General Talking Pictures doctrine because it was not imposing a limitation on the field in which a manufacturer-licensee of Lexmark could operate, which is all that the doctrine addresses. Instead, Lexmark imposed a restriction on what its own customers might do with the product that Lexmark sold them. or to explicitly condition sales, without need to rule on whether the post-sale restrictions were valid, or as overruling Mallinckrodt's approval of post-sale restrictions. Which interpretation is correct remains to be seen. The Federal Circuit's decision in the en banc reargument of Lexmark Int'l v. Impression Prods. should provide a more definitive answer, subject of course to possible further review in the Supreme Court.See supra note _. International exhaustion An emerging issue is whether U.S. patent exhaustion is international or strictly national. Until recently, or at least since the formation of the Federal Circuit in 1982 until recently,There are many earlier cases, however, holding that a U.S. patentee can trigger domestic exhaustion by making or authorizing a foreign sale. E.g., Dickerson v. Matheson, 57 F. 524, 527 (2d Cir. 1893) (\\"A purchaser in a foreign country, of an article patented in that country and also in the United States, from the owner of each patent, or from a licensee under each patent, who purchases without any restrictions upon the extent of his use or power of sale, acquires an unrestricted ownership in the article, and can use or sell it in this country.\\"); accord Curtiss Aeroplane & Motor Corp. v. United Aircraft Eng'g Corp., 266 F. 71, 77 (2d Cir. 1920); Seiko v. Refac Tech. Dev. Corp., 690 F. Supp. 1339, 1342 (S.D.N.Y. 1988); Holiday v. Mattheson, 24 F. 185 (S.D.N.Y. 1885). most U.S. courts simply assumed that a sale outside the United States, even if made by the U.S. patent owner or its parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, or by the U.S. patent owner's licensee, did not trigger the exhaustion doctrine within the United States. Usually, the basis for the assumption was (1) the Supreme Court allegedly so held in Boesch v. Graff,;133 U.S. 697 (1890). (2) a foreign patent is a different property right that is not the same as a corresponding U.S. patent because foreign patent law is different from U.S. patent law and gives different scope to such a foreign patent;See, e.g., Griffin v. Keystone Mushroom Farm, Inc., 453 F. Supp. 1283, 1285 (E.D. Pa. 1978) (\\"The sale or use of each machine in both countries represents potentially two separate torts against the plaintiff and infringes potentially on two separate sets of rights held by him .... The non-tortiousness of defendant's conduct in Italy cannot enter into an adjudication of the plaintiffs rights in this country.\\"). and (3) many cases hold that U.S. patent law has no \\"extraterritorial\\" application.See, e.g., Jazz Photo Corp. v. ITC, 264 F.3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001). See also Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. v. Jazz Photo Corp., 394 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (in response to Jazz's argument that Fuji had already been adequately rewarded by its earnings on its sale of the product in Japan, the Federal Circuit said: \\"The patentee's authorization of an international first sale does not affect exhaustion of that patentee's rights in the United States. ...Moreover, Fuji's foreign sales can never occur under a United States patent because the United States patent system does not provide for extraterritorial effect.\\");accord Minebea Co., Ltd. v. Papst, 444 F. Supp. 2d 68, 140-41 (D.D.C. 2006). None of these points is on firm, sound ground. In the Boesch case, a seller entirely unrelated to the U.S. patent owner made the sale in Germany; the German seller had a right to sell the product under German law because it had begun preparation to manufacture the product before the U.S. patent owner applied for its German patent.Hecht, the German seller, had the right to make and sell the patented burners in Germany because under German law one \\"who, at the time of the patentee's application, ha[d] already commenced to make use of the invention in the country...\\" had the right to continue selling the product despite the subsequent issuance of a German patent to Boesch. Boesch, 133 U.S. at 701. The U.S. company (the patentee) had no complicity in the sale and did not profit from it, and could not possible be accused of \\"double dipping.\\"This \\"double dipping\\" point is the basis of the current Japanese position on international exhaustion. In BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG v. Rashimekkusu Japan Co. Ltd. and JAP Auto Prod. Co., Ltd. (Sup. Ct. Japan July 1, 1997) (translated in 29 Int'l. Rev. Indus Prop & Copy. 331), the Japanese Supreme Court held that an overseas sale of hubcaps exhausted the seller's Japanese patent rights in Japan. BBS, a German manufacturer of aluminum hubcaps and the owner of the hubcap patent rights in both Germany and Japan, sold the hubcaps in Germany. Jap Auto Products and Raximex, Japanese companies, purchased the products in Germany and then imported them into Japan. The intermediate appellate patent court (Tokyo High Court) said, in reference to \\"double dipping\\": > [T]he opportunity of the patent holder to receive compensation for the > disclosure of the invention is limited to one opportunity. ...[I]t does not > make any particular difference whether the putting into circulation takes > place within the country or abroad. For the mere fact that national borders > are crossed does not constitute a sound reason why a second opportunity for > compensation for the disclosure of the invention should be allowed.\\" Jap Auto Products Kabushiki Kaisha and Another v. BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG; BBS v. Rashimex Japan Co. et al., Hanrei Jiho 3 (No. 1524) (March 23, 1995), reproduced in 27 IIC 550 (1996) - BBS Wheels H and 21 AIPPI (Japanese Gr. Journal) 36 (1/1996). This is quite unlike the usual U.S. situation, such as that in the Lexmark and Jazz cases, in which the U.S. patent owner was responsible for the foreign sale, and therefore profited from it. The Boesch case is therefore not a proper precedent to support the general international exhaustion situation. Whether foreign patents are comparable to U.S. patents is a factual issue that may differ from case to case, or nation to nation, and cannot be assumed one way or the other. Furthermore, 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 119(a), the U.S. patent statute governing when a U.S. patent can be based on a filing of a foreign patent application, provides that the U.S. patent and the corresponding foreign patent must be \\"for the same invention.\\" Therefore, there may be far more similarity than the cases assume. Finally, the statement that U.S. patent law is without extraterritorial application occurs universally in cases holding that liability for patent infringement under U.S. law should not be based on acts and conduct occurring outside the United States. And even that generality is suspect, for sometimes patent infringement liability in the United States is based on conduct outside the United States.See, e.g., 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 271(f) and (g); Honeywell, Inc. v. Metz Aparatewerkex, 509 F.2d 1137, 1141 (7th Cir. 1975) (\\"although the patent laws of the United States do not have extra-territorial effect, 'active inducement' may be found in events outside the United States if they result in a direct infringement here.\\"); Akzona Inc. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 662 F. Supp. 603, 613 (D. Del. 1987) (\\"inducing activity may take place outside of the United States, so long as the direct infringement occurs within the United States\\"). Applying exhaustion on an international basis does not regulate acts and conduct performed outside the United States; it defines infringement remedies against importation into and sale in the United States on the basis of acts and conduct performed outside the United States.See John A. Rothchild, Exhausting Extraterritoriality, 51 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1187, 1238-39 (2011). The point is now pending decision in the Federal Circuit, because that court has ordered en banc rehearing on that issue in the Lexmark case.Supra note _. The reason that the issue has come to the fore is that the Supreme Court, in its recent copyright decision in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.,133 S. Ct. 1351 (2013). held that a foreign sale authorized by the copyright owners exhausts U.S. copyright. The Supreme Court rested its decision mainly on common-law authority, quoting extensively from Coke's Institutes (Coke on Littleton), and saying that this stated the general rule from which any exception must be proved. Some have thought, therefore, that the same principle applies at least as forcefully in patent law as in copyright law, so that patent exhaustion should be international just as copyright exhaustion is. In EuropeInternational patent exhaustion in Europe is discussed in Christopher Stothers, Patent Exhaustion: the UK perspective, 16th Annual Conference on Intellectual Property Law and Policy, Fordham University School of Law, 27 March 2008 . In the EU, member states recognize international exhaustion on a regional basis: a product first sold in an EU member state will exhaust the patent owner's rights in all other EU member states; but a sale in a non-EU country will not exhaust rights in any EU country. See Centrafarm BV v. Sterling Drug Inc, Case 15/74, 1974 E.C.R. 1147 (\\"[O]bstacles to free movement may. be justifiable for reasons of protection of industrial property when the protection is invoked against a product coming from a Member State in which it is not patentable and has been manufactured by third parties without the consent of the patentee or where the original patentees are legally and economically independent of-each other; the derogation to the principle of free movement of goods is not justified when the product has been lawfully put by the patentee himself or with his consent, on the market of the Member State from which it is being imported, e.g. in the case of a holder of parallel patents.\\"). and Japan, a regime of absolute or modified international exhaustion of patent rights is followed. Australia, New Zealand, and Norway also adopt international patent exhaustion.Id. at 96. See also T. Syddall, Parallel Imports get Go-Ahead in New Zealand, MANAGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (Oct. 1998). The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) explicitly leaves to each member state the freedom to address exhaustion of intellectual property.TRIPS: Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Apr. 15, 1994, Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, Annex 1C, THE LEGAL TEXTS: THE RESULTS OF THE URUGUAY ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS 320 (1999), 1869 U.N.T.S. 299, 33 I.L.M. 1197 (1994), at Art. 6. A World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) reportWIPO Committee on Development and Intellectual Property (CDIP), Patent Related Flexibilities in the Multilateral Legal Framework and Their Legislative Implementation at the National and Regional Levels, (5th Sess.), CDIP/5/4 (Mar. 1, 2010). in 2010 provides a listing of various countries' statutory provisions on international exhaustion.According to the WIPO report, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, China, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Jordan, Kenya, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Paraguay, Philippines (for drugs and medicines), Singapore (with the exception of pharmaceutical products under certain conditions), South Africa, Uruguay, and Vietnam have statutory international exhaustion provisions. Id., ¬∂58 and Annex II(2). The Andean Community, like the EU, has exhaustion within the community. Id., Annex II(2). National exhaustion, however, obtains in \\"Ghana, Liberia, Madagascar, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Tunisia, Uganda, and a certain number of Asian countries, such as the Philippines.\\" Marco Aleman, Paper delivered at WIPO Regional Seminar on the Effective Implementation and Use of Several Patent- Related Flexibilities, Patent Exhaustion (2011). See also Marco Aleman, Regional Seminar on the Effective Implementation and Use of Several Patent- Related Flexibilities, Topic 14: Exhaustion of Rights, Bangkok (Mar. 29, 2011). Standing or right to assert exhaustion Another emerging issue under the exhaustion doctrine is what persons may assert the exhaustion doctrine as a defense to a claim of patent infringement. In most of the exhaustion cases discussed earlier in this article, the facts of the case follow what may be termed a \\"straight line\\" pattern: A patentee A (or its licensee) makes and sells a product a covered by patent P1 to customer C. C then does something with a that A has ordered (by some sort of agreement or putative agreement) C not to do. A patent infringement suit, A v. C, follows. Diagrammatically, this fact pattern may be represented as: > A ‚Üí a (P1) ‚Üí C *where a(P1) means that patent P1 covers product a and the ‚Üí > indicates a sale New information-technology inventions can lead to exhaustion suits following a different fact pattern, because of peculiarities of information technology and present U.S. patent law. An information-technology invention may involve several aspects each of which has a separate stakeholder. For example, a smartphone, TV set, or set-top box may be economically important to both equipment manufacturers and content providers, as well as the end user public (i.e., consumers). A license or sale to one stakeholder may or may not trigger the exhaustion doctrine with respect to conduct by another stakeholder, perhaps depending on how relevant business transactions are structured. Under present U.S. patent law, a method claim of a patent is infringed only when a single actor performs each step of the claim.Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532 F. 3d 1318, 1329 (2008) (direct infringement under ¬ß 271(a) requires a single party to perform every step of a claimed method); see Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Technologies, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2111 (2014) (Court said it was \\"assuming, but not deciding\\" that the Federal Circuit's rule requiring that all steps of a method patent be attributable to a single direct infringer was correct). Similarly, induced infringement of a method claim has the same requirement.Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Technologies, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2111 (2014). System claims raise more complicated issues. One can make the system only by placing each element into combination with the others, but it is possible to be liable for using a system invention merely by commercially exploiting the system.Centillion Data Sys. LLC v. Qwest Comm. Int'l Inc., 631 F.3d 1279 (2011). Direct use infringement occurs when a part \\"put[s] the invention into service, i.e., control[s] the system as a whole and obtain[s] benefit from it,\\" even though different persons operate the different components of the system. Id. at 1284. Therefore, when both the relevant equipment manufacturer and content provider utilize aspects of the invention in a method claim, whether infringement liability attaches to them may depend on both how the relevant claim is written and how licenses or sales are structured. This is illustrated in pending smartphone litigation, in which structure dictated the legal outcome.See Post Limelight v. Akamai, Are Multi-actor Method Patent Claims D.O.A.? (June 3, 2014). In Helferich Patent Licensing, LLC v. New York Times Co.,778 F.3d 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2015). the Federal Circuit overturned a district court's summary dismissal on exhaustion grounds of a patent infringement suit against content providers. The invention concerns methods and systems for alerting smartphone users to content that may be of interest to them, for example, breaking news stories. The way the invention works is along these lines: A content provider such as the New York Times sends a text message to its online subscribers' smartphones. The message might consist of a headline and the lead to a story, together with a hyperlink to the story as stored in the online database of the New York Times. A subscriber interested in reading the story clicks on the link and thus causes the browser for the smartphone to retrieve and display the story. The way the claims were drafted is very important to the outcome. There are two relevant types of claim, One set considers only smartphone manufacturers, and the claims describe only acts performed in the smartphone (receiving signals, clicking on hyperlinks, etc.). The other set of claims considers only acts that the content providers perform (sending the text message alert, storing the news story, sending it out over the Internet in response to a hyperlink click, etc.). Thus, it is possible to infringe one set of these single-actor claims without infringing the other. The patentee licensed substantially all smartphone manufacturers in the United States under the first set of patents. It then sought to license content providers. When some content providers, including the New York Times, refused to take licenses under the second set of patents, claiming that under the exhaustion doctrine they needed no licenses, the patentee sued them. Instead of the \\"straight line\\" fact pattern described above for prior exhaustion cases, this case has a different, bi-directional pattern. Diagrammatically, the fact pattern of this type of case is as follows: > P ‚Üí lic (P1) ‚Üí A, a *Patentee P licenses manufacturer A under patent P1 (the > smartphone patents) to make smartphones a embodying the patented invention. > A then sells smartphones a to consumers C. A ‚Üí a (P1) ‚Üí C ‚Üê i (P2) ‚Üê B > *Content provider B sends news alerts and content i to consumers C, thus > practicing the method claimed in patent P2 (the content provider patents). On appeal from the district court's summary judgment ruling, the Federal Circuit held that the structure of the patent licensing arrangement avoided the exhaustion doctrine. The court ruled that the exhaustion doctrine may be asserted only by an \\"authorized acquirer\\" ‚Äî one who purchases the patented article from the patentee or its authorized seller. The court further explained this, using slightly different terminology: > [It is a] core notion that exhaustion lifts legal restrictions on an > authorized acquirer. The doctrine has never applied unless, at a minimum, > the patentee's allegations of infringement . . . entail infringement of the > asserted claims by authorized acquirers . . . Here, as noted, that is not > so, because infringement of the content claims has not been . . . shown to > require that [the authorized] handset acquirers are practicing those claims. As the patentee put it in its brief, and the court accepted, \\"the exhaustion doctrine protects only the ability of a purchaser (or other lawful possessor) of an article to use and sell the article.\\"Main Br. 11. The content providers were not parties to the transaction that triggered whatever exhaustion there was ‚Äî that transaction was the sale of smartphones by manufacturers to consumers. The exhaustion doctrine exists to protect the interests of purchasers, not third parties.But see the speech of Lord Bridges in British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co., [1986] 1 All ER 850, [1986] AC 577 (H.L.), in which he said: \\"What the owner needs, if his right to repair is to be of value to him, is the freedom to acquire a previously manufactured replacement exhaust system in an unrestricted market.\\" See also the similar US ruling in Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U.S. 336 (1961). in which the US Supreme Court permitted a spare parts supplier to defend against a charge of patent infringement by asserting the right of automobile purchasers to refurbish their automobiles, a right deriving from the exhaustion doctrine. See Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476, 484 (1964) (citing Univis and Adams v. Burke, 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453 (1873). to support the right of repair). The patentee told the Federal Circuit, and it apparently agreed, that the exhaustion doctrine does not immunize the conduct of the content providers, \\"regardless of the effect on the amount of licensed content available to their subscribers' handsets.\\"Reply Br. 11. Moreover, the patent claims licensed to the manufacturers (the P1 of the diagram above) are not infringed by the conduct of the content providers accused of infringement. Their conduct infringes the P2 patent claims that were not licensed to the manufacturers. The only sale in the case was by the licensed smartphone manufacturers to the consumer end users, and that sale exhausted only the P1 claims. The Federal Circuit said exhaustion cannot occur as to unrelated patent claims. The court added that the content providers had not shown that the licensed P1 claims embodied substantially the same invention as the P2 patent claims under which the content providers were sued, so that the doctrine of the Univis and Quanta cases did not apply to expand the scope of the exhaustion. There is another possible way to analyze cases of this type, but the parties did not raise it and the court did not address it. That would be to make an equitable estoppel analysis as to whether smartphone purchasers had reasonable expectations at the time of purchase and whether the result reached in the case unfairly and substantially derogated from the rights the purchasers expected to enjoy, as a result of conduct by the plaintiff. That is an approach similar to one of those that the House of Lords considered in the British Leyland case.British Leyland Motor Corp v Armstrong Patents Co, [1986] 1 All ER 850, [1986] AC 577 (H.L.). Comparable doctrines outside U.S. Other countries recognize legal doctrines comparable to the exhaustion doctrine of U.S. patent law. =Canada= In Eli Lilly and Co. v. Apotex Inc.,[1998] 2 S.C.R. 129. the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the principle that sale of a patented article exhausts the patentee's right in that article.The court said: \\"If the patentee sells the patented article that he made, he transfers the ownership of that article to the purchaser. This means that, henceforth, the patentee no longer has any right with respect to the article which now belongs to the purchaser who, as the new owner, has the exclusive right to possess, use, enjoy, destroy or alienate it.\\" In the Eli Lilly case the Supreme Court also took the position that subsequent purchasers are not bound by any contractual limitations imposed by the patentee, unless they are brought to their attention at the time of sale: \\"restrictive conditions imposed by a patentee on a purchaser or licensee do not run with the goods unless they are brought to the attention of the [subsequent] purchaser at the time of their acquisition.\\" This principle appears to differ somewhat from U.S. patent law, in which bringing the restriction to the attention of the purchaser is generally immaterial.See the Quanta case, discussed earlier in this article, in which the U.S. Supreme Court held the purported restriction ineffective despite notice. =Germany= Approximately 60 percent of European patent litigation is in German courts.W. von Meibom and M. Meyer, Licensing and Patent Exhaustion (Nov. 5, 2008). German law has long recognized the exhaustion doctrine.In 1902 the Reichsgericht held, \\"The proprietor who has manufactured the product and has put it on the market under this protection which excludes competition from other parties, has enjoyed advantages which the patent confers upon him and has thus exhausted his right.\\" Guajakol Karbont51 RGZ 129 (Mar. 26, 1902). In the Fullplastverfahren case, the German Federal Supreme Court stated: > The doctrine [of exhaustion] finds its justification in the argument that > the holder of the rights who puts into circulation the product produced > under the application of the protected procedure has had the opportunity to > avail himself of the advantages granted by the patent.GRUR 1980, 38. A commentator asserts that the decision of the German Federal Supreme Court in the Brochure Rock caseGRUR 1997, 116, 117 (English translation published in IIC 1998, 207). would require a contrary result as to the fact pattern of the U.S. Quanta case (discussed above). The sale of the chips would not exhaust the patent rights to the computer systems containing the chips, so that LG in that case would have been entitled to a further royalty payment from Quanta despite LG's license to the chip manufacturer Intel.See W. von Meibom and M. Meyer, Licensing and Patent Exhaustion (Nov. 5, 2008). A recent decision of the D√ºsseldorf District Court,Decision of Dec. 12, 2013 ‚Äì Case 4b O 88/12 (Daten√ºbertragungssystem/Data memory system). however, perhaps points to greater similarity between German and U.S.; patent law. The case had facts almost identical to those of the Quanta case. The court held that the sale of the component did not exhaust the patent rights on the system because, among other things, the components sold by the suppliers did not make use of the teachings of the system patent. As for using the doctrine of the U.S. Quanta case, the D√ºsseldorf District Court stated that the rationale for such an \\"extended exhaustion doctrine\\" could only be to prevent the patent owner from enjoying the advantages of the patent more than once, that is, \\"double dipping\\" or \\"double charging.\\" The court said that such a danger of double charging at different stages of the distribution chain and, thus, a rationale for an \\"extended exhaustion doctrine,\\" might exist if, in one and the same patent, there is a claim to the overall device and a claim to an individual component of the overall device. That was not the case here. A second basis for an \\"extended exhaustion doctrine\\" might exist if the overall device and its individual components are protected by different patents (as here), but only when the inventive concept of the two patents is the same and is substantially embodied in the component. But that was not true here, as it was in the Quanta case. This is the point of possible similarity to Quanta, but it is entirely in the form of obiter dicta, The court ruled that the fact that the component had no reasonable use except in making the patented system (which was so in the Quanta case) did not matter, because that raised an implied license issue rather than an exhaustion issue. The component manufacturer's license expressly disclaimed any such implied license as to the system (as in the Quanta case).  References  External links *Box-wrap patent infringement *Quanta v.
