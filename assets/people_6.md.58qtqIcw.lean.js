It was the first film produced by Mel Brooks's Brooksfilms company.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080724/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv The film examines the subject matter of obesity, addiction, family, self-acceptance and singlehood. Plot As the DiNapoli siblings‚ÄîAntoinette (Anne Bancroft), Dominic (Dom DeLuise), and Frank Jr. (Ron Carey) - are growing up, whenever young Dom was unhappy, the one thing his mother did to comfort him and make him feel cared for was to feed him something scrumptious. One example was Dom's mom giving her older son a cannolo after the boy got urinated on by his baby brother Frankie as the baby's diaper is being changed. Because of this, Dom grew up with a love of food, a trait shared by his equally obese cousin, Salvatore (Sal). When Sal suddenly dies at age 39, the family grieves. This prompts Antoinette to urge Dom to visit a diet doctor to avoid his cousin's unhealthy eating habits and not drive himself into an early grave as well. Dom agrees to do so once he recognizes signs that obesity is ruining his health. Dom is deeply disheartened when given his new diet plan, seeing the long list of delectable foods and dishes that he enjoys very much but now must avoid. When the diet fails, Dom's eating habits drive his sister crazy, so she enrolls him in the \\"Chubby Checkers\\" support group. Meanwhile, Dom meets Lydia (Candice Azzara), who owns the neighborhood antiques shop, and finds they have a lot in common. But being self-conscious about his body contours, he fears rejection, and can't bring himself to ask her for a date Dom had Frankie padlock the fridge and larder, but that proves to be little help because in the middle of the night, Dom, crazed by cravings for his favorite decadent delights (even having dreamed of marzipan candy), demands the keys from his brother, even threatening him with violence at one point, of which he is extremely ashamed afterward. Now further depressed, Dom seeks comfort from his support group Chubby Checkers‚Äîcalling Sonny and Oscar (Richard Karron and Paul Zegler) -- who turn out to be no help at all, as their reminiscing about favorite desserts and delicacies causes the intervention to deteriorate into the pig-out party to end all pig-out parties. Sonny even tears the pantry doors off their hinges. To help their brother, Antoinette and Frankie bring together Dom and Lydia. While dating, Dom doesn't realize that he has been eating less and less, and is shocked to discover at how loosely his clothes fit in a matter of weeks. Dom decides to propose to his lovely new sweetheart. When he drops by Lydia's apartment, she is gone. It worries him so much, he ends up eating all of the Chinese takeout food he was supposed to pick up for a family party. Antoinette finds out and attacks Dom with a doll mounted on a stick, and comments how he's hurting the family. Dom admits his acknowledgement of this, and starts to blame his mother for comforting him with food all his life. Antoinette learns this for the first time, and comforts him after a mental breakdown while he insults his mother. Dom notes Antoinette's revelation of his issues, and promises to keep trying. However, he also realizes that he must love himself the way he is, and makes the duo promise to do the same should he die of obesity like Sal. After which, Antoinette and Frank learn to accept him for who he is. Dom then receives a phone call from Lydia, who is at a hospital in Boston visiting her younger brother, who accidentally chopped off a finger. Dom flies in and when the two take a walk through the hospital, watching the newborn babies in the nursery, Dom whispers his marriage proposal into Lydia's ear, and she accepts. The film ends with a photo montage of now-married Dom and Lydia, then their babies ‚Äî with each photo showing Lydia holding a new baby, while the previous child grows up. Dom's obesity persists through the years, apparently exacting no toll upon the family's happiness, until the final image reveals him surrounded by Lydia and their many children...and seemingly thinner.

Critic Peter Wu described the film as \\"A very humorous and yet serious movie about obesity,\\" going on to write: \\"Maybe being overweight isn't the best thing for a person's health, but being one's self and being happy is all that really matters in life ... With a delightful blend of New York Italian culture and the human problem of overeating, Fatso makes for an entertaining movie experience. Loaded with some of the funniest comedy gags I have ever seen, Fatso is a very humorous and yet serious movie about a very touchy subject, Dom DeLuise!\\" Other critics, such as Gene Siskel\\"'Fatso': DeLuise lends weight; film can't support him\\" and Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fatso-1980 were not as kind. Siskel called it \\"[an] emaciated script idea\\", \\"a major disappointment for Bancroft, who is making her directorial debut [and] an even bigger disappointment for this critic, who has been arguing for years that DeLuise is a gifted actor capable of playing leading roles.\\" Ebert remarked that \\"two basic dramatic approaches to fatness are to regard it as comic, or tragic. Anne Bancroft has somehow avoided both approaches in 'Fatso,' a movie with the unique distinction of creating in its audiences an almost constant suspense about how they're supposed to be reacting. The movie itself just doesn't know: 'Fatso' has a director, a screenplay and a cast who are all uncertain about how they really feel about overweight.\\" Another critical point of view said succinctly, \\"the biggest weight problem in the movie was the heavy hand of director Bancroft.\\" Impact This film was also reviewed in the psychiatric monograph The Eating Disorders, which concluded that the film \\"... veers between comedy and pathos as a man discovers ... fat is the ... only sin in America.\\" They approvingly note that, \\"The motivation for overeating and binge dieting are lampooned ... [and] medical consequences ... are elaborated in ... comedic fashion.\\"A.J. Giannini, A.E. Slaby (eds), The Eating Disorders (1993) NY Springer-Verlag p. 273. The film marked a turning point in the lives of actors Richard Karon and Paul Zegler who played DeLuise's obese \\"Chubby Checker\\" support group members. Both actors lost large amounts of weight in the years subsequent to the making of the film.

At this time Padiham's ground was on the banks of the River Calder, hence the nickname, The Caldersiders. Padiham was one of the first clubs to support the legalisation of professional football. However, this backfired as they were unable to compete with clubs in larger towns such as Blackburn, and the club folded in 1916. The club lost their ground during World War I and lay dormant until after the end of the Second World War. Then in 1949 the club was resurrected with the opening of the Arbories Memorial Sports Ground. A crowd of 1,777 turned up to see their opening fixture of the season in the Lancashire Combination Football League. They became founder members of the North West Counties Football League in 1982 but left the league in 1990. They returned in 2000 after spending ¬£500,000 on upgrading the Arbories Memorial Sports Ground and finished in the top four of the second division in 2003 and 2005. They gained promotion to the Northern Premier League Division One North for season 2013/14 after winning the North West Counties Football League Premier Division in season 2012/13, but returned to the North West Counties League after being relegated two seasons later. =Racial abuse= In October 2018, a game between Congleton Town and Padiham was called off after fans subjected Padiham players to racial abuse, and Padiham players' wallets were emptied in the changing rooms during the game.

In 1979 he became Secretary General of the Comit√© d'Etude et de Liaison des Int√©r√™ts Bretons (CELIB) at Lanester. Between 1983 and 2000 he was director of the Cultural Institute of Brittany and had an important role in the conception and publication of the collection Les Bretons au-del√† des mers : Explorateurs et grands voyageurs (Quimper, Ed. Nouvelles du Finist√®re, 1996). He was also involved in the conception and publication of the following works: 500 Bretons √† conna√Ætre (Ancre de Marine, 1989), revising the Guide Bleu Bretagne (Hachette, 1991), Guides Gallimard Bretagne, Les noms qui ont fait l‚Äôhistoire de Bretagne (Coop Breizh/ICB, 1997), Dictionnaire des femmes en Bretagne (UTL/Coop Breizh, 1999), La Bretagne entre Armor et Argoat (Reader‚Äôs Digest, 1999). On 12 November 1999 Le Nail was accused by the French communist newspaper L'Humanit√© of being a former activist of the Breton separatist organisation the Front de Lib√©ration de la Bretagne (FLB) Liberation Front of Brittany. He strenuously denied this accusation, but made no apologies for his defence of Breton culture and language in the face of the highly centralised French state. Several organisations also objected to local councils in Brittany disseminating free of charge, in schools, his and his wife Jacqueline's Dictionnaire des romanciers de Bretagne (Keltia Graphic, 1999), dealing with Breton novelists. Under his own name and under the pseudonym Joseph Br√©hier, Le Nail also published numerous articles in newspapers and journals on Breton historical and cultural issues. In 2001 Le Nail established the publishing house 'Les Portes du large' which specialised in accounts of Breton voyagers and explorers, travelers in Brittany and studies of Breton relations with other Celtic countries. Bernard Le Nail had a significant role in increasing knowledge of Breton explorers of the coast of Australia, as publisher of Philippe Godard's and Tugdual de Kerros' book on Louis de Saint Alo√ºarn (2002).

Abu Qatada was accused of having links to designated terrorist organizations, and frequently imprisoned in the United Kingdom without formal charges or prosecution before being deported to Jordan, where courts found him innocent of multiple terrorism charges. Abu Qatada claimed asylum in the United Kingdom in 1993 on a forged passport. In 1999, he was convicted in absentia in Jordan of planning thwarted terror plots during Jordan's millennium eve, and was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment with hard labour. Abu Qatada was repeatedly imprisoned and released in the United Kingdom after he was first detained under anti-terrorism laws in 2002, but was not prosecuted for any crime. The Algerian government described Abu Qatada as being involved with Islamists in London and possibly elsewhere. After initially barring the United Kingdom from deporting Abu Qatada to Jordan, in May 2012 the European Court of Human Rights denied him leave to appeal against deportation.Reuters, \\"Britain: Radical Cleric Faces Setback in Court Over Efforts to Deport Him\\", reprinted by The New York Times, 9 May 2012. On 12 November 2012, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) upheld Abu Qatada's appeal against deportation and released him on restrictive bail conditions. The Home Secretary Theresa May said the government would appeal against the decision. He was deported to Jordan on 7 July 2013, after the UK and Jordanian governments agreed and ratified a treaty satisfying the need for clarification that evidence potentially gained through torture would not be used against him in his forthcoming trial. On 26 June 2014, Abu Qatada was retried as is required by the Jordanian legal system if the defendant is returned to the country. He was found not guilty by a Jordanian court of terrorism charges relating to an alleged 1999 plot. He remained in prison pending a verdict that was due September 2014 on a second alleged plot. On 24 September 2014, a panel of civilian judges sitting at Amman's State Security Court cleared him of being involved in a thwarted plot aimed at Western and Israeli targets in Jordan during the millennium celebrations in 2000 due to \\"insufficient evidence\\". Evidence used to convict him in the previous trial were overturned, per the treaty signed between the United Kingdom and Jordan, as they may have been potentially acquired through torture. Despite his history with militancy, scholar of Islam Daniel Lav argues that it should not hide his scholarly credentials in the traditional Islamic sciences, as \\"he certainly has connections to al-Qa ªida, but he is also the author of a polemic against the theological views of a nineteenth-century rector of al-Azhar, coauthor of a reference work on the eleventh-century scholar Ibn Hazm's evaluations of transmitters of hadith, and editor of an influential twentieth- century Wahhabi work of theology.\\"Daniel Lav, Radical Islam and the Revival of Medieval Theology, Cambridge University Press (2012), p. 2. In the same tone, Victoria Brittain, a former associate foreign editor of The Guardian, and who knows him personally, also says that \\"the man behind the myth is a scholar with wide intellectual and cultural interests.

Life Abu Qatada, who was born Omar Mahmoud Othman, has Jordanian nationality because he was born in Bethlehem in the West Bank in 1960, which at that time was ruled by Jordan. In 1989, he went to Peshawar in Pakistan where he served as a professor of sharia sciences. He obtained his Bachelor's in Islamic jurisprudence in 1984 while in JordanJakob Skovgaard-Petersen, \\"The King, the Boy, the Monk and the Magician: Jihadi Ideological Entrepreneurship between the UK and Denmark\\" in Exploring the Multitude of Muslims in Europe: Essays in Honour of J√∏rgen S.

Retrieved 3 March 2012. In 1991, after the Gulf War, Abu Qatada was expelled from Kuwait, along with many other Palestinians. He returned to Jordan, but in September 1993, he fled with his wife and five children to the UK, using a forged UAE passport. Citing religious persecution and stating he had been tortured in Jordan, Abu Qatada requested asylum, which was granted in June 1994. Around 1994, Abu Qatada started up and was editor-in-Chief of a weekly magazine, Usrat al- Ansar, a Groupe Islamique Arm√© (GIA) propaganda outlet.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.120 Abu Qatada provided the intellectual and ideological support for the journal,Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p.263 which became \\"a trusted source of news and information about the GIA for Islamists around the world.\\" Abu Qatada was granted leave to remain to 30 June 1998. On 8 May 1998, he applied for indefinite leave to remain. This application had not been determined before Abu Qatada‚Äôs arrest on 23 October 2002. On that date British authorities detained him under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.ECtHR judgment: \\"CASE OF OTHMAN (ABU QATADA) v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\\", 17 January 2012 Abu Qatada resided in the United Kingdom until 7 July 2013, when he was deported back to Jordan to face retrials for alleged involvement in varied Jordanian mayhem. He was freed after both Jordanian retrials, in which by formal agreement with the UK government evidence obtained by torture was discarded. His imprisonment ended in September 2014. According to Conservative politician Boris Johnson, Abu Qatada's residence in Britain is estimated to have cost the British taxpayer at least ¬£500,000 in benefit payments to his family and other expenses by early 2012. The Daily Telegraph claimed the cost to be as high as ¬£3 million by May 2012, a figure that was not confirmed by the British Home Office. Views Abu Qatada belonged to the Salafi sect, though he strongly criticised the followers of fellow Salafi Rabee al-Madkhali for being too closely aligned to the Saudi government. At the same time Abu Qatada praised fellow Salafi writer Nasiruddin Albani and considered him a great scholar. In 1995, Abu Qatada reportedly issued a fatwa stating that it is justified to both kill Muslims who renounce their faith and kill their families.The Guardian, 24 April 2013, Timeline: Abu Qatada In 1997, Abu Qatada called on Muslims to kill the wives and children of Egyptian police and army officers. In October 1999, he gave a speech at London's Four Feathers mosque in which he \\"effectively issued a fatwa authorising the killing of Jews, including Jewish children\\", according to the British case against him. He reportedly told his congregation that American citizens \\"should be attacked, wherever they were\\" and that \\"there was no difference between English, Jews and Americans\\". In a sermon on 14 September 2001, he described the 9/11 attacks as part of a wider battle between Christendom and Islam. In autumn 2002, a poem praising Osama bin Laden and glorifying the attacks appeared online. It was attributed to Abu Qatada. In another sermon he stated that it was not a sin for a Muslim to kill a non-believer for the sake of Islam. The contents of an article written by him for Al-Risalah, the propaganda magazine of al-Qaeda in Syria, were reported by several news outlets. In it he said that Islam will dominate every land and the \\"state of Jews\\" will collapse by the \\"grace of Allah\\". He also attacked the Shias in the article calling by them the derogatory term \\"Rawafidh\\" and said \\"Allah exposes our enemies from amongst the filthy Rawafidh, heretics, and their beloved friends from the amongst the polytheists\\". In January 2016, Abu Qatada released a video on his YouTube account, the 24th installment of a project entitled 1,000 Books before Death, discussing The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and in which he stated (as translated by MEMRI), that blood libel accusation against Jews is true, stating that \\"This Jewish blood matzos ... there is a text in the Talmud ... It says that the matzos eaten by the Jews on their holiday must be consecrated with the blood of a man from among the Gentiles. Usually they take a Christian because they cannot overpower a Muslim. This actually happened, yet they [the BBC] treat it as a mockery.\\" In the same video, Abu Qatada alleged that \\"The Jews control the world and that is a fact. The Jews run the global economy, that is a fact. Do you want me to give you the numbers? Can any rational person who has read the history of the Bolshevik Revolution deny that it was won due to the support of the Jews, and the Jewish money of the Rothschild family? Can anyone deny that Lenin was Jewish? Can any rational person dare say that there is even one Communist party in the world that was not founded by the Jews?\\"\\"Jordanian Cleric Abu Qatada Al-Filistini Discusses The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, States: Jews Use Blood for Passover Matzos\\", MEMRITV, Clip No. 5284 (transcript), 9 and 18 January 2016 (video clip available here). Links and influence Although Abu Qatada distanced himself from al-Qaeda following his arrest in London in 2001, Fawaz Gerges remarks that Abu Qatada had extensive contacts with al-Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan at the time. Jason Burke notes, \\"Qutada has impeccable traditional and modern Salafist credentials and had acted as the in-house alim to radical groups, particularly in Algeria, from his base in northwest London since 1994\\". In 2001, after bin Laden was criticised by a Salafist faction for issuing fatwas, he turned to Abu Qatada for support, and the support was forthcoming. According to the indictment of the Madrid al-Qaeda cell prepared by Spanish prosecutors in 2001, Abu Qatada was \\"considered the spiritual leader\\" of al-Qaeda in Europe and other groups including the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), and the Tunisian Combat Group. Abu Qatada has been called by The Times a preacher or advisor to al-Qaeda terrorists Zacarias Moussaoui and Richard Reid. According to The Independent, videos of Abu Qatada's sermons were found in the Hamburg apartment of Mohamed Atta when it was searched after the 11 September 2001 attacks, which Atta led. When questioned in the UK in February 2001, Abu Qatada was in possession of ¬£170,000 cash and ¬£805 in an envelope labelled \\"for the Mujahedin in Chechnya\\". Mr Justice Collins, then chairman of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) that rejected his appeal against detention without charge or trial in 2004, said that Abu Qatada was \\"heavily involved, indeed was at the centre in the United Kingdom of terrorist activities associated with al-Qaeda. He is a truly dangerous individual\\". Abu Qatada was subsequently released in 2005, never having been charged with any crime. Abu Qatada's name is included in the UN al-Qaeda sanction list pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267. In 2005, Abu Qatada recorded a video message to the kidnappers of peace activist Norman Kember, appealing for Kember to be released. BBC journalist Alan Johnston was kidnapped in Gaza on 13 March 2007. Johnston's captors, the Doghmush clan who headed the Army of Islam, demanded the release of dozens of captives, including Abu Qatada. Abu Qatada offered to help negotiate Johnston's release. In 2012 the al-Qaeda- linked Somali group Al-Shabaab threatened an attack against the UK if Abu Qatada was deported. On 7 February 2012, The Daily Telegraph reported that a senior manager at the BBC had instructed its journalists not to call Abu Qatada an extremist. The BBC subsequently used the form of words \\"accused of being one of the UK's most dangerous extremist preachers\\". Others have described him as \\"a prominent political refugee\\". Persona non-grata Abu Qatada was reported in February 2012 as being wanted on terrorism charges in the United States, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Italy and Algeria. Jordan convicted Abu Qatada in absentia; but the conviction did not hold when he appealed in person, after his removal from the UK, where he had spent over a decade in front of various courts in an ultimately vain attempt to avoid deportation. Summaries of these two procedures are given below, in the next two sections. =Convictions in Jordan and retrial acquittals= In 1999, Abu Qatada was sentenced in absentia by Jordan to life imprisonment with hard labour for conspiracy to carry out terror attacks, and subsequently he was convicted in 2000 to a further 25 years for his involvement in a plot to bomb tourists attending millennium celebrations in Jordan. The 1999 conviction related to events described by the US State Department in 1998 as involving the \\"Reform and Defiance Movement‚Äîa small, mostly indigenous radical Islamic group\\" targeting the Modern American School and a major hotel between mid- March and early May, with bombings which caused minor property damage but no casualties.U.S. State Department, Patterns of Global Terrorism 1999 p29Referred to in the 2009 Law Lords judgement as the \\"'Reform and Challenge' case\\". para 42 In 2008, the UK Court of Appeal concluded \\"that his 1999 conviction for terrorism was based on evidence extracted through torture\\". At Abu Qatada's 2012 SIAC hearing, Mr Justice Mitting observed that the evidence presented by Jordan against Abu Qatada \\"seems extremely thin\\". Overall, between 2007 and his deportation in 2013, as many as 12 senior British judges in various courts recognised the torture origins of the evidence against him. Upon returning to Jordan in July 2013, he exercised his right under Jordanian law to a retrial since he was originally convicted in absentia. A Jordanian military court refused to grant him bail during the retrial as he faced terrorism charges. His trial took place in the State Security Court in Amman. On 26 June 2014, Abu Qatada was found not guilty of the charges relating to the 1998 bombings. On 24 September 2014, a panel of civilian judges sitting at Amman's State Security Court cleared him of being involved in the thwarted plot aimed at the millennium celebrations in 2000, as previous evidence was overturned. =Arrest and detention in UK= In February 2001, Abu Qatada was arrested and questioned in connection with a German terror cell. There was insufficient evidence against him, and all charges were dropped. Tapes of his sermons were later discovered in a Hamburg flat used by the 9/11 hijackers. The Home Office stated that Abu Qatada was the spiritual guide to the 9/11 ringleader Mohamed Atta. In the wake of 9/11, new anti-terror legislation was quickly introduced in the UK. Abu Qatada, who had hitherto lived with his family in Acton, west London, disappeared. His disappearance and his previous alleged contacts with MI5, prompted speculation by the Times that he was working with British intelligence and had agreed to provide them with information on suspects in the \\"war on terror\\". The Times reported that \\"Britain ignored warnings‚Äîwhich began before the 11 September attacks‚Äîfrom half a dozen friendly governments about Abu Qatada's links with terrorist groups and refused to arrest him. Intelligence chiefs hid from European allies their intention to use the cleric as a key informer against Islamic militants in Britain.\\" According to The Guardian: Members of the EDL and others besieged the Abu Qatada's family home every Saturday, and the police only put an end to the severe, and reportedly terrifying, harassment after a court case forced them to. The duration and location of his detention‚Äîwithout charge or trial‚Äîwas described by one British judge as \\"lamentable ... extraordinary ... hardly, if at all, acceptable\\". 2002‚Äì2008 In October 2002, Abu Qatada was arrested in south London and taken to Belmarsh Prison. Here he began a long legal battle against deportation. In October 2002, the then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, detained Abu Qatada indefinitely without trial under Part 4 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (ATCSA), which at that time provided for such detention. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission subsequently rejected an appeal by Abu Qatada to be released from detention without trial. Abu Qatada claimed he feared he would be tortured were he to return to Jordan. During this period Abu Qatada lived in a legal twilight as Asim Qureshi, of UK-based human rights group CagePrisoners, explained: \\"He has not been able to see the evidence against him neither has his lawyer. The only person representing him is a special advocate who is not allowed to speak to him or his solicitor. There you have the bizarre situation where someone is representing him who has never met him or his lawyer.\\" In 2005, Part 4 of ATCSA was replaced by the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, which replaced detentions with control orders, and Abu Qatada was released under such a control order. Five months later, on 12 August 2005, Abu Qatada was detained again pending deportation to Jordan. A British court ruled on 26 February 2007 that he could be deported to Jordan. 2008‚Äì2011 On 9 April 2008, the Court of Appeal ruled that Abu Qatada could not be returned to Jordan as he would face a further trial where there was a strong probability that evidence obtained by torture might be used; therefore, extradition would amount to a breach of the United Kingdom's obligations under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. He was released on bail by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission on 8 May 2008, subject to a 22-hour home curfew and other restrictions. His bail security was provided by former terrorist hostage Norman Kember, whose release Abu Qatada had requested before Kember's rescue by the SAS in 2006. In November 2008, Abu Qatada was rearrested at his home. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission revoked his bail, stating he had not broken bail conditions, but might do at some time in the future. The commission accepted the government's claim that Abu Qatada posed a significant risk of absconding, and returned him to prison pending his possible deportation. On 18 February 2009, the House of Lords ruled that Abu Qatada could be deported to Jordan, with Lord Hoffmann declaring that \\"There is in my opinion no authority for a rule that ... the risk of the use of evidence obtained by torture necessarily amounts to a flagrant denial of justice\\".The Guardian, 18 February 2009, \\"Abu Qatada takes deportation fight to European court after law lords ruling\\" On the same day Home Secretary Jacqui Smith served a deportation order against Abu Qatada. No step was taken to enforce the order pending Abu Qatada's appeal to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). In the same month the ECHR awarded Abu Qatada ¬£2,500 in a lawsuit he filed against the UK, after judges ruled that his detention without trial in the UK breached his human rights. 2012‚Äì2014 On 17 January 2012, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Abu Qatada could not be deported to Jordan as that would be a violation of his right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This was the first time the court ruled that such an expulsion would be a violation of Article 6. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission subsequently ruled that Abu Qatada should be bailed on highly prescriptive terms for three months while the British government sought further reassurances from Jordan. Under the UN Convention Against Torture, to which the UK is a signatory, states are obliged to refrain from complicity in torture, and thus are forbidden from deporting people to places where a real risk of torture exists. Torture was rife at the time in Jordan and Human Rights Watch has documented allegations of severe abuse, specifically against Islamist detainees. Abu Qatada was released on bail on 13 February 2012. He was prohibited from using a mobile phone, computer or the internet, and subject to an electronically monitored 22-hour curfew that only allowed him to leave home twice a day for a maximum of one hour. On 17 April 2012, Abu Qatada was rearrested at his home in London.Somaiya, Ravi and Alan Cowell, \\"Britain Arrests Muslim Cleric, Again Seeking Deportation\\". The New York Times, 17 April 2012. In a statement the same day the Home Secretary, Theresa May, said that reassurances and information received from Jordan meant that Abu Qatada could now be deported. His lawyers said they had lodged an appeal at the European Court of Human Rights, amidst confusion whether the three-month deadline for reappealing following 17 January ruling had passed or not. On 20 April 2012, Abu Qatada requested the Home Secretary to revoke the deportation order of 18 February 2009. On 18 May 2012, the Home Secretary notified Abu Qatada of her refusal to revoke the order. The European Court of Human Rights had already denied Abu Qatada leave to appeal earlier in the month without specifying a reason, normally taken to indicate that the court considers no new issues have arisen. Abu Qatada was granted leave to appeal in the UK and the case was heard by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). On 12 November 2012, SIAC upheld the appeal, ruling that Abu Qatada was still at risk of having evidence obtained under torture used against him and that the Home Secretary was wrong not to revoke the deportation order against him. Abu Qatada was granted bail on restrictive conditions. The Home Secretary Theresa May said the government would appeal the decision. Abu Qatada's solicitor Gareth Peirce, commenting on the ruling, said: \\"It is important to reaffirm this country's position that we abhor the use of torture and a case that was predicated upon evidence from witnesses who have been tortured is rejected‚Äîrejected by the courts of this country as by the European Court\\". Nevertheless the ruling attracted criticism that SIAC had effectively overturned the 2009 ruling of the House of Lords, at the time the highest court of the land. The Prime Minister David Cameron expressed his frustration that Abu Qatada was still in the UK. In March 2013, Abu Qatada was rearrested after allegedly breaching his bail conditions. On 27 March, the Court of Appeal rejected the Home Secretary's appeal from the November 2012 SIAC rulinghttp://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/277.html and, in April 2013, denied her leave to appeal, on the basis that \\"states cannot expel someone where there is a real risk that they will face a trial based on evidence obtained by torture\\". Qatada boards a plane for deportation to Jordan. In May 2013, Abu Qatada pledged he would leave the UK if the UK and Jordanian governments agreed and ratified a treaty clarifying that evidence gained through torture would not be used against him in his forthcoming trial. On 7 July 2013, following the ratification of such a treaty, Abu Qatada was deported from the United Kingdom on a plane bound for Jordan from RAF Northolt. Abu Qatada's struggle against deportation, and the underlying UK policy of \\"deportation with assurances\\", were documented in a study by the UK's Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. In June 2014, a court in Jordan cleared Abu Qatada of involvement in a 1998 bombing campaign, and in September 2014 he was cleared of planning to attack millennium celebrations. He was released from prison on 24 September 2014. By July 2015, Abu Qatada had re-surfaced in an interview for the al Nusra magazine Al Risalah explaining that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was to be opposed because he \\"committed great atrocities against the Muslims, and this is why we are forced to speak out against them\\", while specifically qualifying that opposition to ISIL did not include distaste for their acts against Americans or westerners: \\"We don‚Äôt oppose ISIS because they oppose the enemies of Allah ... only because ISIS makes takfir on the Muslims and kills them do I and others have the right to speak against them, even if it is an Islamic state.\\" The Turkistan Islamic Party's 19th issue of its magazine Islamic Turkistan contained an interview with Abu Qatada, and Abu Qatada wrote an article in the same issue on jihad. Abdullah al Muhaysini, Hani al Siba'ee, Abu Qatada and Abdurazak al Mahdi appeared in a TIP video. Doƒüu T√ºrkistan B√ºlteni Haber Ajansƒ± reported that the Turkistan Islamic Party was praised by Abu Qatada along with Abdul Razzaq al Mahdi, Maqdisi, Muhaysini and Ayman al-Zawahiri. Muheisini endorsed jihadist scholars like Al-Balawi, Eyad Quneibi, Tareq Abdulhalim, Hani al-Siba'i, Yusuf al-Ahmed, Abdulaziz al-Tureifi, Suleiman al-Ulwan, Abu Qatada al-Filistini, and Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi.

In 1960, she became the first Indian sportswoman to be awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian honour in India. Born in Kolkata, India, Arati had been introduced to swimming at the early age of four. Her precocious talent was spotted by Sachin Nag, and later she was inspired by the ace Indian swimmer Mihir Sen to try to cross the English Channel.  Early life  Gupta came from a middle class family. She was born the second of three children and the first of two daughters to Panchugopal Saha in 1940. Her father was an employee in the armed forces. At the age of two and half, she lost her mother. Her elder brother and younger sister Bharati were raised at their maternal uncle's house, while she was raised by her grandmother in North Kolkata. When she reached the age of four, she would accompany her uncle to the Champatala Ghat bath, where she learned to swim. Noticing his daughter's interest in swimming, Panchugopal Saha enrolled his daughter in the Hatkhola Swimming Club. In 1946, at the age of five, she won the gold medal in 110 yards freestyle at the Shailendra Memorial Swimming Competition, beginning her swimming career.  Career  State, national sports and Olympics = Between 1945 and 1951 she won 22 state-level competitions in West Bengal. Her main events were 100 metre freestyle, 200 metres breast stroke and 300 metres breast stroke. She came second only to Dolly Nazir of Bombay.In 1948, she participated in the national championship held at Mumbai. She won silver in 100 metres freestyle and 200 metres breast stroke and won bronze in 200 metres freestyle. She made an all- India record in 1950. At the 1951 West Bengal state meet, she clocked 1 minute 37.6 seconds in 100 metres breast stroke and broke Dolly Nazir's all-India record. At the same meet, she set new state-level record in 100 metres freestyle, 200 metres freestyle and 100 metres back stroke. She represented India at the 1952 Summer Olympics along with compatriot Dolly Nazir. She was one of the four women participants and the youngest member of the Indian contingent at the age of 12. At the Olympics, she took part in 200 metres breast stroke event. At the heats she clocked 3 minutes 40.8 seconds. After returning from the Olympics, she lost in 100 metres freestyle to her sister Bharati Saha. After the loss, she concentrated only on breast stroke. = Crossing the English Channel = She used to take part in long distance swimming competition in the Ganges. Arati got the first inspiration to cross the English Channel Channel from Brojen Das. At the 1958 Butlin International Cross Channel Swimming Race, Brojen Das became the first among the men and earned the distinction of being the first person from the Indian subcontinent to cross the English Channel. Greta Andersen, a Danish-born female swimmer from United States clocked 11 hours and 1 minute and stood first among both men and women. This inspired the female swimmers all over the world. Arati sent a congratulatory message to Brojen Das on his victory. He replied back stating that she was too shall to be able to do it. He proposed the name of Arati to the organizers of the Butlin International Cross Channel Swimming Race for the next year's event. Arati began to seriously think about participating in the event. Mihir Sen welcomed her decision and encouraged her. Dr. Arun Gupta, the assistant executive secretary of Hatkhola Swimming Club took the initiative in organising Arati's participation at the event. He organised exhibits of Arati's swimming prowess as part of a fund raising programme. Jamininath Das, Gour Mukherjee and Parimal Saha also provided their help in organising Arati's trip. However, in spite of the efforts of her supporters, funds fell short of the target. At this point Sambhunath Mukherjee and Ajay Ghoshal took up the matter with Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, the Chief Minister of West Bengal. He arranged a grant of 11,000. Jawahar Lal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India also showed interest in Arati's endeavour. While the logistics of her trip were being arranged, Arati began swimming for long hours. On 13 April 1959, Arati swam continuously for eight hours at the pond in Deshbandhu Park, in the presence of renowned swimmers and thousands of supporters. Later she swam for 16 hours. She sprinted the last 70 metres and showed almost no signs of fatigue. On 24 July 1959, she left for England along with her manager Dr. Arun Gupta. She started her final practice in the English Channel on the 13 August. During this time, she was mentored by Dr. Bimal Chandra, who was also participating at the 1959 Butlin International Cross Channel Swimming Race. A total of 58 participants including five women from 23 countries took part in the competition. The race was scheduled for 27 August 1959 at 1 am local time from Cape Gris Nez, France to Sandgate, England. However, the pilot boat of Arati Saha did not arrive in time. She had to start 40 minutes later and lost the optimum condition. By 11 am, she had swum more than 40 miles and came within 5 miles of the England coast. At that point she faced a strong current from the opposite direction. As a result, by 4 pm, she could only swim about two more miles. While she was still determined to carry on, she had to quit. In spite of the failure, Arati was determined not to give up. She prepared herself for a second attempt. Her manager Dr. Arun Gupta was ill, but she carried on with her practice. On 29 September 1959, she made her second attempt. Starting from Cape Gris Nez, France, she swam for 16 hours and 20 minutes, battling tough waves and covered 42 miles to reach Sandgate, England. On reaching the coast of England, she hoisted the Indian flag. Vijaylakshmi Pandit was the first to congratulate her. Jawahar Lal Nehru and many eminent people personally congratulated her. On 30 September, the All India Radio announced the achievement of Arati Saha.  Later life  Arati had completed her Intermediate from City College. In 1959, under the supervision of Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, she married her manager Dr. Arun Gupta. First they had a court marriage and later a social marriage. Her in law's house was in Tarak Chatterjee Lane, very near to her grandmother's house. After marriage she had a daughter named Archana. She was employed in Bengal Nagpur Railway. On 4 August 1994, she was admitted to a private nursing home in Kolkata with jaundice and encephalitis. After battling against the illness for 19 days, she died on 23 August 1994.  Recognition  She was awarded Padma Shri in 1960. She was the first Indian woman sportsperson to receive the award. In 1999, the Department of Posts celebrated her conquest by bringing out a postage stamp of 3 denomination. In 1996, a bust of Arati Saha was erected near her residence. The 100-metre long lane in front of the bust was renamed after her. On the day that would have been her 80th birthday in 2020, she was featured as a Google Doodle.

History The station opened as Acton by the Grand Junction Railway in 1837 but was renamed Acton Bridge in 1870. After merging into the London and North Western Railway, the company became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. In addition to its main line calls, the station also served as the terminus of a local service from Crewe via & until 1942. This used a connecting curve that diverged from the main line just north of to join the Cheshire Lines Committee line from to near (this remains in use, but for freight traffic only). When sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Regional Railways until the privatisation of British Railways. Trains of the Intercity Sector passed on the West Coast Main Line. When British Rail was privatised Acton Bridge was served by Central Trains until 2007, then served by London Midland, now London Northwestern. Services Acton Bridge has two trains per hour in weekday peak hours, reducing to one every two hours (with some even longer gaps) outside the peaks, all operated by London Northwestern trains, running between and . On Sundays, trains start later and are between Liverpool and Birmingham with the exception of a single train to Walsall at 10pm. Passenger Station Services Acton Bridge is un- staffed, however, tickets can be purchased from a self-service ticket machine, which is connected to the national network, located inside the booking hall. The station, and its gardens, are maintained by volunteers from Acton Bridge Women's Institute, and won a Commendation in the 2003 JPD 'Best Kept Station' competition.

A lifelong Midwesterner, Blessing continued to work in regional theaters in and around his hometown of Minneapolis through his 40s before relocating to New York City. Life and work Blessing was born in Minneapolis, and graduated from Minnetonka High School in 1967. He began his college education at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, but later transferred to Reed College in Oregon where he earned a B.A. in English in 1971. After Blessing earned his degree, his parents offered the young graduate the choice between a used car or a trip to Russia. Blessing chose Russia where he found inspiration to write his best-known work, the award-winning A Walk in the Woods. According to interviews with Blessing, the play, which depicts the developing relationship between a Russian and an American arms limitation negotiator is based on fact. Apparently, during the 1982 talks in Geneva, Switzerland, Soviet Yuli Kvitsinsky and American Paul Nitze left the formal discussions to literally take a walk in the woods. Following its premiere in Waterford, Connecticut, A Walk in the Woods was nominated for both a Tony award and a Pulitzer Prize. Though the production won neither award, it was reprised produced in Moscow in 1989 and later adapted for television. Upon returning from his tenure abroad, Blessing went on to study playwriting at the University of Iowa where he received MFA degrees in English and Speech and Theater. He would later return to teach at the Iowa's Playwrights Workshop and the Iowa Writers' Workshop in addition to his time as an instructor at the Playwright's Center in Minneapolis. He currently serves as Head of the graduate playwriting program at Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University. Blessing's most recent plays include A Body of Water, Whores, The Scottish Play, Black Sheep, Fortinbras, and many others. He has also written one act plays including The Roads That Lead Here and Eleemosynary. Eight of his plays have been staged at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut during the prestigious National Playwrights Conference. Several of his most recent works produced in New York City including Thief River, Cobb and Chesapeake, received Drama Desk nominations and an award, plus nominations from the Outer Critics Circle. Blessing married his first wife, Jeanne Blake, in 1986. He is currently married to fellow playwright and screenwriter, Melanie Marnich.

Born into a cricketing family at Newick, north of Lewes, John Langridge followed his elder brother James into the Sussex side in 1928 and stayed there until he retired in 1955. In between, he scored more than 34,000 runs as an opening batsman and made 76 centuries, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1950. Considered unlucky not to have earned a place in the national team, only Alan Jones of Glamorgan has scored more runs but not played for his country, and no one who scored as many centuries as Langridge failed to win international recognition. In addition, Langridge took 784 catches, mostly at slip, including 69 in his last season at the age of 45; only five players have taken more catches in a career or in a season.Player Profile from CricInfo Langridge became a first-class umpire on retirement and stood in seven Test matches and eight One Day Internationals.

They serve to encode large numbers of genes at a time. TAGs represent a large proportion of genes in a genome, including between 14% to 17% of the human, mouse, and rat genomes. TAG clusters may have as few as two genes, with small clusters predominating, but may consist of hundreds of genes. An example are tandem clusters of rRNA encoding genes. These genes are transcribed faster than they would be if only a single copy of the gene was available. Additionally, a single RNA gene may not be able to provide enough RNA, but tandem repeats of the gene allow sufficient RNA to be produced. For example, cells in a human embryo contain between five and ten million ribosomes, and cell number doubles within 24 hours. In order to provide the necessary ribosomes, multiple RNA polymerases must consecutively transcribe multiple rRNA genes. In some species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, most TAGs are the result of unequal chromosomal crossover during genetic recombination.

He was first detained in Pakistan in 2002 and sent to Bagram Theater Internment Facility, then Guantanamo. He was not charged, and was returned to the United Kingdom on 25 January 2005. Personal life Belmar was born and brought up in Marylebone, London. He has a sister and an older brother. His father is Catholic, and he attended St George's Roman Catholic Secondary School. He trained as a mechanic and worked for the Post Office. He converted to Islam in 1999, after his elder brother. He spent some time in Pakistan, and says he travelled to Afghanistan to study at a religious school in July 2001. Detention In a letter he wrote to his family 10 days after the September 11 attacks, Belmar described living under a regime of \\"bad food\\" and intense physical training. Belmar says he was in Kandahar, and tried to leave Afghanistan five times, once disguising himself in a burqa. He says he walked across the mountains, reaching Pakistan in December 2001. He returned to Karachi, and says he did not contact the British Consulate as he thought that anyone who had been in Afghanistan was at risk of arrest. US officials said Belmar was captured at an al Qaeda safe house in Pakistan in February 2002. His family was told in October 2002 that he had been taken into custody due to an expired visa, and in December 2002 they were told he had been transferred to Guant√°namo Bay. In Pakistan, an FBI/CIA team investigating the murder of Daniel Pearl interrogated Belmar. A senior US official told The Observer that he recommended Belmar be released back to the UK, but MI5 officers who interviewed Belmar in Karachi declined a US suggestion that they try to recruit him, so he was sent instead to Bagram. En route to Bagram, Belmar says he was struck on the back of the head, leaving a dent. He was held and interrogated at Bagram for more than six months, then sent to Guantanamo. British diplomats in Pakistan, acting for his family attempted to establish his whereabouts while he was in Bagram, were denied access to him and were not informed of his transfer to Guantanamo until 5 months after it occurred. Release Like nine other UK citizens held at Guantanamo Bay, he was repatriated to the UK. He was flown into RAF Northolt on 25 January 2005, along with Moazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga and Feroz Abbasi, where he was arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 and briefly questioned at Paddington Green police station, before being released. The police decided that confessions given to MI5 officers were not admissible evidence. In an interview after his release, he retracted what he said during interrogation, including having heard Bin Laden speak. He claims to have been beaten and sexually humiliated during interrogations, and to have been hung in the strappado position. His father has said: \\"They have said he was in Afghanistan in 1998 studying chemicals at the terrorists' base but I know he was in London.\\" ReferencesExternal links *WikiLeaks secret file on Richard Belmar *UK Appeals Court Rules Out Government‚Äôs Use of Secret Evidence in Guant√°namo Damages Claim Andy Worthington Category:British extrajudicial prisoners of the United States Category:Living people Category:Converts to Islam Category:English Muslims Category:Guantanamo detainees known to have been released Category:Bagram Theater Internment Facility detainees Category:1979 births Category:English expatriates in Pakistan ","title":"Richard Belmar"},{"id":"2739160","title":"List of cities, towns and villages in Zeeland"},{"id":"2739162","text":"This is a list of cities, towns and villages in the province of North Brabant, in the Netherlands. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - !

Currently used for distribution of natural gas. public park located at in Seattle, Washington. A gasworks or gas house is an industrial plant for the production of flammable gas. Many of these have been made redundant in the developed world by the use of natural gas, though they are still used for storage space.  Early gasworks  Coal gas was introduced to Great Britain in the 1790s as an illuminating gas by the Scottish inventor William Murdoch. Early gasworks were usually located beside a river or canal so that coal could be brought in by barge. Transport was later shifted to railways and many gasworks had internal railway systems with their own locomotives. Early gasworks were built for factories in the Industrial Revolution from about 1805 as a light source and for industrial processes requiring gas, and for lighting in country houses from about 1845. Country house gas works are extant at Culzean Castle in Scotland and Owlpen in Gloucestershire. Equipment A gasworks was divided into several sections for the production, purification and storage of gas. =Retort house= Retort house at the Launceston Gasworks, Launceston, Tasmania. This contained the retorts in which coal was heated to generate the gas. The crude gas was siphoned off and passed on to the condenser. The waste product left in the retort was coke. In many cases the coke was then burned to heat the retorts or sold as smokeless fuel. =Condenser= This consisted of a bank of air-cooled gas pipes over a water- filled sump. Its purpose was to remove tar from the gas by condensing it out as the gas was cooled. Occasionally the condenser pipes were contained in a water tank similar to a boiler but operated in the same manner as the air- cooled variant. The tar produced was then held in a tar well/tank which was also used to store liquor. =Exhauster= An impeller or pump was used to increase the gas pressure before scrubbing. Exhausters were optional components and could be placed anywhere along the purifying process but were most often placed after the condensers and immediately before the gas entered the gas holders. =Scrubber= A sealed tank containing water through which the gas was bubbled. This removed ammonia and ammonium compounds. The water often contained dissolved lime to aid the removal of ammonia. The water left behind was known as ammonical liquor. Other versions used consisted of a tower, packed with coke, down which water was trickled. =Purifier= Also known as an Iron Sponge, this removed hydrogen sulfide from the gas by passing it over wooden trays containing moist ferric oxide. The gas then passed on to the gasholder and the iron sulfide was sold to extract the sulfur. Waste from this process often gave rise to blue billy, a ferrocyanide contaminant in the land which causes problems when trying to redevelop an old gasworks site. =Benzole plant= Often only used at large gasworks sites, a benzole plant consisted of a series of vertical tanks containing petroleum oil through which the gas was bubbled. The purpose of a benzole plant was to extract benzole from the gas. The benzole dissolved into the petroleum oil was run through a steam separating plant to be sold separately. =Gasholder= The gas holder or gasometer was a tank used for storage of the gas and to maintain even pressure in distribution pipes. The gas holder usually consisted of an upturned steel bell contained within a large frame that guided it as it rose and fell depending on the amount of gas it contained. By-products The by- products of gas-making, such as coke, coal tar, ammonia and sulfur had many uses. For details, see coal gas. British gasworks today Coal gas is no longer made in the UK but many gasworks sites are still used for storage and metering of natural gas and some of the old gasometers are still in use. Fakenham gasworks dating from 1846 is the only complete, non-operational gasworks remaining in England. Other examples exist at Biggar in Scotland and Carrickfergus in Northern Ireland. Photos of Fakenham Gas Works Gasworks in popular culture Gasworks were noted for their foul smell and generally located in the poorest areas of metropolitan areas. Cultural remnants of gasworks include many streets named Gas Street or Gas Avenue and groups or gangs known as Gas House Gang, such as the 1934 St. Louis Cardinals baseball team. The 1946 film Gas House Kids features children from New York's Gas House District taking on a gang, and spawned two sequels. Ewan McColl's 1968 song \\"Dirty Old Town\\" (about his home town of Salford) famously begins \\"Found my love by the gaswork croft‚Ä¶\\" (in cover versions often \\"I met my love by the gasworks wall‚Ä¶\\")http://www.metrolyrics.com/dirty-old-town-lyrics-rod- stewart.html  Railway gasworks  Eveleigh gasworks Gas was used for many years to illuminate the interior of railway carriages. The New South Wales Government Railways manufactured its own oil-gas for this purpose, together with reticulated coal-gas to railway stations and associated infrastructure. Such works were established at the Macdonaldtown Carriage Sheds, Newcastle, Bathurst, Junee and Werris Creek. These plants followed on from the works of a private supplier which the railway took over in 1884. Gas was also transported in special travelling gas reservoir wagons from the gasworks to stationary reservoirs located at a number of country stations where carriage reservoirs were replenished. With the spreading conversion to electric power for lighting buildings and carriages during the 1920s and 1930s, the railway gasworks were progressively decommissioned.A Brief History of NSW Railway Gasworks Longworth, Jim Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, June, 2003 pp203-213 Gasworks being operated as industrial museumsGasworks Brisbane, Australia= The Gasworks Newstead site in Brisbane Australia has been a stalwart of the river‚Äôs edge since its development in 1863. By 1890, the works were supplying gas to Brisbane streets from Toowong to Hamilton and over the next 100 years, it would grow to supply Brisbane city with the latest in gas technology until it was decommissioned in 1996. In March 1866, the Queensland Defence Force placed an official request for town gas connection, evidence of the vital role the gasworks played in the economic development of colonial Brisbane. In fact, the gasworks were considered to be of such importance, that during World War II, genuine fears of attack from Japanese air raids motivated the installation of anti aircraft guns which vigilantly watched over the plant and its employees throughout the war. The site itself has been synonymous with economic growth and benefit to Brisbane and Queensland with the success of the gasworks facilitating further development of the Newstead/Teneriffe area to include the James Hardie fibro-cement manufacturing plant, Shell Oil plant, Brisbane Water and Sewerage Depot and even the ‚ÄúBrisbane Gas Company Cookery School‚Äù which operated in the 1940s. In 1954, a carbonizing plant was built, giving Brisbane the \\"most modern gas producing plant in Australia\\", consuming 100 tonnes of coal every eight hours. During its golden years in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the site also played a vital role in providing employment to aboriginal Australians and many migrant workers arriving there from Europe after the second World War. The fine tradition of the Brisbane Gasworks economic and employment-based successes will not be lost or forgotten with the Teneriffe Gasworks Village Development paying homage to the sites history and integrity in its pending urban development. The gasholder structure at this site is set to become a hub of a new property development on the site ‚Äì keeping the structural integrity of the pig iron structure.

Constructed when the total population of Adelaide numbered 315,200 (1893 census), the Happy Valley Reservoir now supplies over a half a million people, from Adelaide's southern extent to the city-centre. It is also home to much wildlife, including many kangaroos. Construction Built between 1892 and 1897 at a cost of A$1.8 million it was the third reservoir constructed in South Australia as a supplement to the Thorndon Park Reservoir (built 1860) and the Hope Valley Reservoir (built 1872). The original Happy Valley township, school and cemetery were completely flooded by the new reservoir requiring their relocation. The township was moved to the east while the cemetery, which is still in use today, was moved to the west and relocated alongside the base of the dam wall. The school, originally located on Candy road, was relocated south to two acres of land on Red Hill Road (later renamed Education road) which was donated by local farmer Harry Mason. While some students attended O'Halloran Hill or Clarendon schools for the 18 months that the Happy Valley school was closed, some did not attend any school until it was re-opened on 26 September 1898. The school closed in December 1979 and re- opened on a new site on the other side of the road directly opposite.Happy Valley school history The reservoir acts as a 'holding pond' for water directed to it from the Clarendon Weir via a five km long tunnel. The 1.8 m diameter tunnel was bored simultaneously from both ends and when meeting had a deviation of 25 mm. Its deepest point underground is 122 m where it passes through a hill. On 7 August 1896 the tunnel's inlet valve was opened by the Governor of South Australia, Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton and the reservoir began filling.Adelaide Water Supply. The Manning index of South Australian history. State Library of South Australia Continuing use Initially 15 kilometres from Adelaide, the reservoir is now largely enveloped by the city's southern suburbs, of which the relocated Happy Valley village is now one. Although the reservoir is relatively small in capacity; holding only 11,500 megalitres and is dwarfed by Mount Bold Reservoir which is at least four times larger, it is the site of the biggest water treatment plant in Adelaide and is responsible for providing more than 40% of the city's water. With public access prohibited, the natural \\"bush\\" of the reservoir's enclosed catchments are home to kangaroos, echidnas and koalas. Several areas have also been planted with managed pine plantations to reduce soil erosion and provide an income from harvesting. As a result of the plantations being located within what are now inner city suburbs they have become almost iconic. In the early 2000s, plans to harvest the mature pines were blocked following public protests over the visual impact the clearance and replanting would have on the surrounding suburbs. Water from the dam was originally supplied to Adelaide through a tunnel under Black Road. In the early 1960s, the original intake tunnel from the Clarendon Weir was increased in size to allow access by maintenance vehicles, and a second outlet tunnel was constructed under South Road. In 1986 this new tunnel became the sole outlet for the reservoir when the original outlet was abandoned.Parliament of south Australia official Hansard Report Happy Valley Reservoir Rehabilitation Project Wednesday 3 July 2002 pdf At the same time the Thorndon Park Reservoir was decommissioned and reestablished as a recreational park. Upgrade Between 2002 and 2004, the Reservoir underwent a major renovation as part of A$22 million rehabilitation project aimed at enhancing the Reservoir to meet guidelines of best practice for dam management at both international and national levels. The reservoir's earth wall was particularly susceptible to piping failure (a small leak, called a pipe, gets larger until the dam collapses) and the renovations lowered the risk of dam wall failure from 1 in 1,200 to an estimated 1 in 100,000. Part of this project included an upgrade of the dam wall designed to also increase flood storage capacity by 165% and reduce risk of damage in the event of an earthquake. With the lowering of the water level during renovations exposing the original Happy Valley township for the first time, archaeologists took the opportunity to excavate the site. Despite the township being entirely intact and undamaged when flooded in 1896, very little was found apart from scattered bricks and the foundations of several buildings of which only the Post Office was identified.Article in The Advertiser in 2002 (help required: date unknown at this time) As nothing of interest was found no research was published. *Capacity: 11.5 Gigalitres *Length of wall: 1,155 m *Height of wall: 23.6 m *Type of wall: Earth with clay core *Area of water spread: 1.88 km2 See also *List of reservoirs and dams in Australia References Category:1897 establishments in Australia Category:Reservoirs in South Australia Category:Dams in South Australia Category:South Australian Heritage Register ","title":"Happy Valley Reservoir"},{"id":"2739212","text":"Sea Dragon is a horizontally scrolling shooter for the TRS-80 computer, written by Wayne Westmoreland and Terry Gilman, and released in 1982 by Adventure International.

Later in his life he came under the influence of Ramakrishna and founded a syncretic \\"New Dispensation\\" inspired by Christianity, and Vaishnav bhakti, and Hindu practices. Early life and education Keshub Chandra Sen was born on 19 November 1838 into an affluent Kayastha family of Calcutta (now Kolkata). His family originally belonged to Gariffa village on the banks of the river Hooghly.

His father Peary Mohan Sen died when he was ten, and Sen was brought up by his uncle. As a boy, he attended the Bengali Pathshala elementary school and later attended Hindu College in 1845. Career In 1855 he founded an evening school for the children of working men, which continued through 1858. In 1855, he became Secretary to the Goodwill Fraternity,under the Danish Grand charter for the missionaries of Danish settlement at Serampore, lodge De L‚Äôamour Fraternelle (for Brotherly Love) whose motto then was \\"Fatherhood of God and Brotherhood of Man\\". a Masonic lodge associated with the Unitarian Rev.

Keshub Sen was also briefly appointed as Secretary of the Asiatic Society in 1854. For a short time thereafter Sen was also a clerk in the Bank of Bengal, but resigned his post to devote himself exclusively to literature and philosophy. On this, Professor Oman who knew him well writes, \\"Endowed with an emotional temperament, earnest piety, a gift of ready speech and a strong leaven of vanity, Keshub Chunder Sen found the sober, monotonous duties of a bank clerk intolerable, and very soon sought a more congenial field for the exercise of his abilities.\\" and he formally joined the Brahma Samaj in 1859.Oman, p. 117. Brahmo Samaj In 1857 Sen again took employment in clerkship, this time as private secretary to Dwijendranath Tagore and joined the Brahmo Samaj. In 1859, Sen dedicated himself to the organisational work of the Brahmo Samaj and in 1862 was assigned, by Hemendranath Tagore, a stipendary ministry (Acharya) of one of its worship houses despite being a non-Brahmin (previously a Shudra untouchable had been made an Acharya by Debendranath Tagore).Sastri In 1858, left his home in Coolootola and took refuge in the Jorasanko House of the Tagore family when the patriarch of the family was then away. In 1862 Sen helped found the Albert College and wrote articles for the Indian Mirror, a weekly journal of the Calcutta Brahmo Samaj in which social and moral subjects were debated. In 1863 he wrote The Brahma Samaj Vindicated. He strongly criticised Christianity and travelled about the country lecturing and preaching that the Brahmo Samaj was intended to revitalise Hindu religion through use of ancient Hindu sources and the authority of the Vedas. By 1865, however, Sen was convinced that only Christian doctrine could bring new life to Hindu society. In November 1865 he was caused to leave the Brahma Samaj after \\"an open break with its founder Debendranath Tagore\\" over Christian practices in Brahmoism, and the next year (1866) with encouragement of the Unitarian preacher Charles Dall he joined another new organisation, BharatBarshiya Brahmo Samaj, as its Secretary ( President being \\"God\\"). Tagore's Brahmo Samaj then quickly purged itself of Sen's Christian teaching, and encouraged being described as Adi Brahmo Samaj to distinguish it from Sen's deliberately eponymous version. Christianity In 1866 Sen delivered an address on \\"Jesus Christ, Europe and Asia\\", in which he proclaimed that \\"India would be for Christ alone who already stalks the land\\", and which fostered the impression that he was about to embrace Christianity. Professor Oman writes \\"From the time of his secession from the parent Society, Keshub by his writings and public lectures enlisted the sympathies of the Viceroy, Sir John Lawrence, who took a deep interest in the work of the native reformer, particularly as Keshub had spoken publicly of Christ in terms which seemed to justify the belief that he was Christian in all but open profession of the faith.\\"Oman, p. 118. This drew attention to him and in 1870 he journeyed to England where he remained for six months. The reception in England disappointed him, as he records much later in a letter to Max M√ºller =Love for Sovereign= In 1870 Keshub introduced a new doctrine into his Church \\"Love for the Sovereign\\". Perceiving Christianity as a model tradition from which the Indians could learn, Keshub became convinced that the British presence in India served a divine purpose for the Indian people. At his historic 1870 meeting with the queen he expressed his acceptance of British rule which pleased the British. This theological stand against Indian nationalism (then being propounded by the Brahmos under Hemendranath Tagore's new doctrine of \\"Brahmos embrace the co-existence of Brahmo principles with governance, but oppose all governance in conflict with Brahmo principles.\\") made Keshub the target of tremendous criticism at home.Uddin, Sufia M. (2006) Constructing Bangladesh: Religion, Ethnicity, and Language in an Islamic Nation. UNC Press. p. 85 =Discord within the Brahmo Samaj of India= The passage of the Special Marriages Act in 1872, caused great resentment among Brahmos that Sen had caused an inherent break with the Brahmo Dharma compiled by Maharshi Debendranath and forever associated with Tagore's Adi Brahmo Samaj. A powerful section of \\"the Brahmo Samaj within the Brahmo Samaj of India\\" and with reformist views more advanced than Keshub's, especially on women's education and upliftment, now openly complained that they were left with no religious status whatsoever other than to turn to Christ like their leader, which was distasteful to them or return to Brahmo Dharma's fold in disgrace. In 1873 Sen was caused to trenchantly counter this faction by the following speech: Annette Akroyd and the female emancipation controversy Around 1875 Sen was involved in a public controversy with Annette Akroyd a prominent feminist and social reformer who had sailed to India in October 1872. Akroyd was shocked by her discussions with Sen and felt that Sen, the rhetorician of women's education in England was a typical Hindu obscurantist back home in India, trying to keep knowledge from the minds of women. This dispute spilled into the native press and had its impact on the Bethune School. Akroyd was also dismayed with Sen's associates such as Bijoy Krishna Goswami, Aghore Nath Gupta and Gour Govinda Ray who were traditionally Hindu in educational background and resisting the education of women in British India. Mysticism controversies He developed a tendency towards mysticism and a greater leaning to the spiritual teaching of the Indian philosophies. He gave his daughter, Suniti Devi in marriage to Maharaja Nripendra Narayan of Cooch Behar; he revived the performance of mystical plays, and himself took part in one. These changes alienated many of his followers, who deserted his standard and founded the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in 1878. Sen did what he could to reinvigorate his followers with new ideas and phrases, such as \\"The New Dispensation\\", the \\"Holy Spirit\\". He also instituted a sacramental meal of rice and water similar to the Sikh system of Amrit (nectar) initiation for new converts. He also attempted a wider appeal to Indians with a more mystical approach. The Ethnographer General writes:- > From about this period, or a little before, Keshub Chandar Sen appears to > have attempted to make a wider appeal to Indians by developing the emotional > side of his religion. And he gradually relapsed from a pure unitarian theism > into what was practically Hindu pantheism and the mysticism of the Yogis. At > the same time he came to consider himself an inspired prophet, and > proclaimed himself as such.Russell, R.V. (1912) Tribes and Castes. > Government Ethnography publication One example of his new doctrines were described by Professor Oman: > In 1873 he brought forward the doctrine of Adesh or special inspiration, > declaring emphatically that inspiration is not only possible, but a > veritable fact in the lives of many devout souls in this age. The following > years witnessed a marked development of that essentially Asiatic and perhaps > more especially Indian form of religious feeling, which finds its natural > satisfaction in solitary ecstatic contemplation.

The lowest class, divided into two sections, is devoted to religious > study and the practical performance of religious duties, including doing > good to others.Oman, pp. 131, 139, 140 On his return to India he established the Indian Reform Association, which had five areas of activity: inexpensive literature, female improvement, education, temperance, and charity. In two lectures delivered between 1881 and 1883 he shared his latest doctrines. They were \\"That Marvelous Mystery ‚Äì the Trinity\\" and \\"Asia's Message to Europe\\". The latter is an eloquent plea against the Europeanizing of Asia, as well as a protest against Western sectarianism. During the intervals of his last illness he wrote The New Samhita, or the Sacred Laws of the Aryans of the New Dispensation. He died on 8 January 1884. His Hindu funeral was attended by over 2000 people. Ramakrishna's influence In 1876 the then unknown Ramakrishna Paramhansa came looking for Sen and first met him at Sadhan Kanan. Ramakrishna's poor, rough, unconventional exterior had earlier repelled other Brahmo celebrities like Debendranath Tagore whom Ramakrishna had approached;Parekh, p. 74 and even Sen initially showed no affinity towards Ramakrishna's mysticism, and was hostile. He was won over to Ramakrishna less by his teachings than by his manner, which Keshub Sen identified with the behaviour of an authentic saint. When Ramakrishna met him, Keshub had accepted Christianity, and had separated from the Brahmo Samaj. Formerly, Keshub had rejected idolatry practised by his family, but after coming under Ramakrishna's influence he again accepted Hindu polytheism and established the \\"New Dispensation\\" (Nava Vidhan) religious movement, which was based on Ramakrishna's principles‚Äî\\"Worship of God as Mother\\", \\"All religions as true\\". His acceptance of idolatry created factions within his organisation. He also publicised Ramakrishna's teachings in the New Dispensation journal over a period of several years, which was instrumental in bringing Ramakrishna to the attention of a wider audience, especially the Bhadralok and the Europeans residing in India. Ramakrishna too had deep respect for Keshub. Ramakrishna said of him shortly before his death that \\"the rose tree is to be transplanted because the gardener wants beautiful roses of him.\\". Afterwards he said, \\"Half of me has perished.\\" Universal religion Sen's primary quest was for a universal religion or belief-system. Sen established a syncretic school of spiritualism, called the Nabo Bidhan or 'New Dispensation', which he intended to amalgamate the best principles of Christianity and of the western spiritual tradition with Hinduism. His opponents felt that he had rejected completely the tenets of Brahmoism settled by Rammohun Roy (as cited by J.N. Farquahar and other scholars), and in January 1881, the New Dispensation was formally announced in the Sunday Mirror of 23 October: > Our position is not that truths are to be found in all religions ; but that > all the established religions of the world are true. There is a great deal > of difference between the two assertions. The glorious mission of the New > Dispensation is to harmonise religions and revelations, to establish the > truth of every particular dispensation, and upon the basis of these > particulars to establish the largest and broadest induction of a general and > glorious proposition.Farquahar, John Nicol (1915) Modern Religious Movements > in India. New York: The Macmillan. pp. 57‚Äì58 Sen adopted a number of ceremonies from both Hinduism and Christianity, calling God \\"Mother\\", and adopting the homa sacrifice and the 'arati' ceremony (the waving of lights) into Brahma ritual. He found spiritual nourishment in Durga Puja, and composed a hymn of praise containing 108 names of God, along with other forms of worship that echoed traditional Hindu prayers. The Nabo Bidhan school generated considerable antagonism among Brahmo Samajists, since Sen's followers represented that they were also Brahmos. Eight Brahmos of Sylhet (now in Bangladesh) including Raj Chandra Chaudhuri and Pandit Sitanath Tattvabhushan issued the following proclamation in 1880: > Let us all, every Brahmo and Brahmo Samaj, combine to let the world know > that the New Dispensation is not the Brahmo religion: That we have not the > least sympathy for the creed : That the New Dispensation is totally opposed > to Brahmoism.Sastri, p. 513 This proclamation of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj resulted in 1881 of the formation of the Brahmo Conference Organisation to publicly denounce and expose Keshub Sen and his Nabo Bidhan movement from every platform as being \\"anti-Brahmo\\" in terms of the aforesaid proclamation. While Sen's detractors opposed and condemned him, he found appreciation in others. Bipin Chandra Pal has succinctly summarised the evolution: > To Keshub, however, was left the work of organising Rammohun Roy's > philosophy into a real universal religion through new rituals, liturgies, > sacraments and disciplines, wherein were sought to be brought together not > only the theories and doctrines of the different world religions but also > their outer vehicles and formularies to the extent that these were real > vehicles of their religious or spiritual life, divested, however, through a > process of spiritual sifting, of their imperfections and errors and > superstitions.Bepin Chandra Pal, \\"The Story of Bengal's New Era: Brahmo > Samaj and Brahmananda Keshub Chunder\\", in Bangabani, 1922.

It causes the balance wheel to oscillate with a resonant frequency when the timepiece is running, which controls the speed at which the wheels of the timepiece turn, thus the rate of movement of the hands. A regulator lever is often fitted, which can be used to alter the free length of the spring and thereby adjust the rate of the timepiece. The balance spring is a fine spiral or helical torsion spring used in mechanical watches, alarm clocks, kitchen timers, marine chronometers, and other timekeeping mechanisms to control the rate of oscillation of the balance wheel. The balance spring is an essential adjunct to the balance wheel, causing it to oscillate back and forth. The balance spring and balance wheel together form a harmonic oscillator, which oscillates with a precise period or \\"beat\\" resisting external disturbances, and is responsible for timekeeping accuracy. The addition of the balance spring to the balance wheel around 1657 by Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens greatly increased the accuracy of portable timepieces, transforming early pocketwatches from expensive novelties to useful timekeepers. Improvements to the balance spring are responsible for further large increases in accuracy since that time. Modern balance springs are made of special low temperature coefficient alloys like nivarox to reduce the effects of temperature changes on the rate, and carefully shaped to minimize the effect of changes in drive force as the mainspring runs down. Before the 1980s, balance wheels and balance springs were used in virtually every portable timekeeping device, but in recent decades electronic quartz timekeeping technology has replaced mechanical clockwork, and the major remaining use of balance springs is in mechanical watches. Types of balance springs: (1) flat spiral, (2) Breguet overcoil, (3) chronometer helix, showing curving ends, (4) early balance springs. History Drawing of one of his first balance springs, attached to a balance wheel, by Christiaan Huygens, inventor of the balance spring, published in his letter in the Journal des S√ßavants of 25 February 1675. There is some dispute as to whether it was invented around 1660 by British physicist Robert Hooke or Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, with the likelihood being that Hooke first had the idea, but Huygens built the first functioning watch that used a balance spring.A. R. Hall, \\"Horology and criticism: Robert Hooke\\", Studia Copernicana, XVI, Ossolineum, 1978, 261-81. Before that time, balance wheels or foliots without springs were used in clocks and watches, but they were very sensitive to fluctuations in the driving force, causing the timepiece to slow down as the mainspring unwound. The introduction of the balance spring effected an enormous increase in the accuracy of pocketwatches, from perhaps several hours per day, p.226 to 10 minutes per day, making them useful timekeepers for the first time. The first balance springs had only a few turns. A few early watches had a Barrow regulator, which used a worm drive, but the first widely used regulator was invented by Thomas Tompion around 1680. In the Tompion regulator the curb pins were mounted on a semicircular toothed rack, which was adjusted by fitting a key to a cog and turning it. The modern regulator, a lever pivoted concentrically with the balance wheel, was patented by Joseph Bosley in 1755, but it didn't replace the Tompion regulator until the early 19th century.Mundy, Bosley Regulator Regulator In order to adjust the rate, the balance spring usually has a regulator. The regulator is a moveable lever mounted on the balance cock or bridge, pivoted coaxially with the balance. A narrow slot is formed on one end of the regulator by two downward projecting pins, called curb pins, or by a curb pin and a pin with a heavier section called a boot. The end of the outer turn of the balance spring is fixed in a stud which is secured to the balance cock. The outer turn of the spring then passes through the regulator slot. The portion of the spring between the stud and the slot is held stationary, so the position of the slot controls the free length of the spring. Moving the regulator slides the slot along the outer turn of the spring, changing its effective length. Moving the slot away from the stud shortens the spring, making it stiffer, increasing the balance's oscillation rate, and making the timepiece gain time. The regulator interferes slightly with the motion of the spring, causing inaccuracy, so precision timepieces like marine chronometers and some high end watches are free sprung, meaning they don't have a regulator. Instead, their rate is adjusted by timing screws on the balance wheel. There are two principal types of Balance Spring Regulator. * The Tompion Regulator, in which the Curb Pins are mounted on a sector-rack, moved by a pinion. The pinion is usually fitted with a graduated silver or steel disc. * The Bosley Regulator, as described above, in which the Pins are mounted on a lever pivoted coaxially with the Balance, the extremity of the lever being able to be moved over a graduated scale. There are several variants which improve the accuracy with which lever can be moved, including the \\"Snail\\" regulator, in which the lever is sprung against a cam of spiral profile which can be turned, the Micrometer, in which the lever is moved by a worm gear, and the \\"Swans Neck\\" or \\"Reed\\" regulator in which the position of the lever is adjusted by a fine screw, the lever being held in contact with the screw by a spring in the shape of a curved swans neck. This was invented and patented by the American George P. Reed, US patent No. 61,867 dated February 5, 1867. There is also a \\"Hog's Hair\\" or \\"Pig's Bristle\\" regulator, in which stiff fibres are positioned at the extremities of the Balance's arc, and bring it to a gentle halt before throwing it back. The Watch is accelerated by shortening the arc. This is not a Balance Spring Regulator, being used in the earliest Watches before the Balance Spring was invented. There is also a Barrow Regulator, but this is really the earlier of the two principal methods of giving the Mainspring \\"set-up tension\\"; that required to keep the Fusee chain in tension but not enough to actually drive the Watch. Verge Watches can be regulated by adjusting the set-up tension, but if any of the previously described Regulators is present then this is not usually done. Material A number of materials have been used for balance springs. Early on, steel was used, but without any hardening or tempering process applied; as a result, these springs would gradually weaken and the watch would start losing time. Some watchmakers, for example John Arnold, used gold, which avoids the problem of corrosion but retains the problem of gradual weakening. Hardened and tempered steel was first used by John Harrison and subsequently remained the material of choice until the 20th century. In 1833, E. J. Dent (maker of the Great Clock of the Houses of Parliament) experimented with a glass balance spring. This was much less affected by heat than steel, reducing the compensation required, and also didn't rust. Other trials with glass springs revealed that they were difficult and expensive to make, and they suffered from a widespread perception of fragility, which persisted until the time of fibreglass and fibre-optic materials.\\"The Marine Chronometer, its History and development\\" by R. T. Gould. Page 161. Hairsprings made of etched silicon were introduced in the late 20th century and are not susceptible to magnetisation. https://www.watchtime.com/featured/silicon-watchmaking- benefits-pros-cons-antimagneism-oechslin-freak-chaulmontet-von-gunten/ Effect of temperature The modulus of elasticity of materials is dependent on temperature. For most materials, this temperature coefficient is large enough that variations in temperature significantly affect the timekeeping of a balance wheel and balance spring. The earliest makers of watches with balance springs, such as Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens, observed this effect without finding a solution to it. John Harrison, in the course of his development of the marine chronometer, solved the problem by a \\"compensation curb\\" ‚Äì essentially a bimetallic thermometer which adjusted the effective length of the balance spring as a function of temperature. While this scheme worked well enough to allow Harrison to meet the standards set by the Longitude Act, it was not widely adopted. Around 1765, Pierre Le Roy (son of Julien Le Roy) invented the compensation balance, which became the standard approach for temperature compensation in watches and chronometers. In this approach, the shape of the balance is altered, or adjusting weights are moved on the spokes or rim of the balance, by a temperature-sensitive mechanism. This changes the moment of inertia of the balance wheel, and the change is adjusted such that it compensates for the change in modulus of elasticity of the balance spring. The compensating balance design of Thomas Earnshaw, which consists simply of a balance wheel with bimetallic rim, became the standard solution for temperature compensation. =Elinvar= While the compensating balance was effective as a way to compensate for the effect of temperature on the balance spring, it could not provide a complete solution. The basic design suffers from \\"middle temperature error\\": if the compensation is adjusted to be exact at extremes of temperature, then it will be slightly off at temperatures between those extremes. Various \\"auxiliary compensation\\" mechanisms were designed to avoid this, but they all suffer from being complex and hard to adjust. Around 1900, a fundamentally different solution was created by Charles √âdouard Guillaume, inventor of elinvar. This is a nickel-steel alloy with the property that the modulus of elasticity is essentially unaffected by temperature. A watch fitted with an elinvar balance spring requires either no temperature compensation at all, or very little. This simplifies the mechanism, and it also means that middle temperature error is eliminated as well, or at a minimum is drastically reduced. Isochronism A balance spring obeys Hooke's Law: the restoring torque is proportional to the angular displacement. When this property is exactly satisfied, the balance spring is said to be isochronous, and the period of oscillation is independent of the amplitude of oscillation. This is an essential property for accurate timekeeping, because no mechanical drive train can provide absolutely constant driving force. This is particularly true in watches and portable clocks which are powered by a mainspring, which provides a diminishing drive force as it unwinds. Another cause of varying driving force is friction, which varies as the lubricating oil ages. Early watchmakers empirically found approaches to make their balance springs isochronous. For example, John Arnold in 1776 patented a helical (cylindrical) form of the balance spring, in which the ends of the spring were coiled inwards. In 1861 M. Phillips published a theoretical treatment of the problem.M. Phillips, \\"Sur le spiral reglant\\", Paris, 1861. He demonstrated that a balance spring whose center of gravity coincides with the axis of the balance wheel is isochronous. In general practice, the most common method of achieving isochronism is through the use of the Breguet overcoil, which places part of the outermost turn of the hairspring in a different plane from the rest of the spring. This allows the hairspring to \\"breathe\\" more evenly and symmetrically. Two types of overcoils are found - the gradual overcoil and the Z-Bend. The gradual overcoil is obtained by imposing two gradual twists to the hairspring, forming the rise to the second plane over half the circumference. The Z-bend does this by imposing two kinks of complementary 45 degree angles, accomplishing a rise to the second plane in about three spring section heights. The second method is done for aesthetic reasons and is much more difficult to perform. Due to the difficulty with forming an overcoil, modern watches often use a slightly less effective \\"dogleg\\", which uses a series of sharp bends (in plane) to place part of the outermost coil out of the way of the rest of the spring. Period of oscillation The balance spring and the balance wheel (which is usually referred to as simply \\"the balance\\") form a harmonic oscillator. The balance spring provides a restoring torque that limits and reverses the motion of the balance so it oscillates back and forth. Its resonant period makes it resistant to changes from perturbing forces, which is what makes it a good timekeeping device. The stiffness of the spring, its spring coefficient, \\\\kappa\\\\, in N*m/radian, along with the balance wheel's moment of inertia, I\\\\, in kg*m2, determines the wheel's oscillation period T\\\\,. The equations of motion for the balance are derived from the angular form of Hooke's law and the angular form of Newton's second law. :\\\\tau=-\\\\kappa\\\\theta=I\\\\alpha\\\\, The following differential equation for the motion of the wheel results from simplifying the above equation: :\\\\frac{d^2\\\\theta}{dt^2}+\\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{I}\\\\theta=0\\\\, The solution to this equation of motion for the balance is simple harmonic motion, i.e., a sinusoidal motion of constant period. :\\\\theta(t) = A\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{I}}t\\\\right) + B\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{I}t}\\\\right)\\\\, Thus, the following equation for the periodicity of oscillation can be extracted from the above results: :T = 2\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{I}{\\\\kappa}}\\\\, This period controls the rate of the timepiece.

The book combines sections from Burroughs' earlier novels, Naked Lunch, The Soft Machine and The Ticket That Exploded, in an attempt to create a new narrative. It is sometimes referred to as a compilation, but this is technically incorrect. Its plot cannot be easily described, although it can be said to focus upon conspiracy and the hero getting away from the police. Although the publisher claimed that it contained previously unpublished material, this was not identified until the Restored edition of 2020, edited by Burroughs scholar Oliver Harris, who argued that the text's novelty in any case depended on recognising it as an early experimental remix or mash-up. Dead Fingers Talk, like many of Burroughs' works, was controversial upon its release. It was the subject of a scathing review in the Times Literary Supplement that resulted in a war of words between supporters and detractors of the novel (and Burroughs in general) that played out in the magazine's letters page for months. Never published outside the UK or translated, the book itself is considered one of the rarer of Burroughs' novels, and was out of print for almost 50 years before the 2020 Restored edition.

Types Medical grade audiometers are usually an embedded hardware unit controlled from a PC. Software audiometers which run on a PC are also commercially available, but their accuracy and utility for evaluating hearing loss is questionable due to lack of a calibration standard. The most common type of audiometer generates pure tones, or transmits parts of speech. Another kind of audiometer is the Bekesy audiometer, in which the subject follows a tone of increasing and decreasing amplitude as the tone is swept through the frequency range by depressing a button when the tone is heard and releasing it when it cannot be heard, crossing back and forth over the threshold of hearing. Bekesy audiometry typically yields lower thresholds and standard deviations than pure tone audiometry.

Amongst his favourite artists were Deep Purple, Rainbow, Jimi Hendrix, Yngwie Malmsteen, Symphony X, Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Niccol√≤ Paganini. In 1998 he created his first project Majestic and the first album was released in 1999, called Abstract Symphony. In 2000, Trinity Overture followed. The band also did a tour in Japan, and was the support act of bands like the Pretty Maids and Symphony X. He played Keyboards for the French progressive metal band Adagio on their debut album Sanctus Ignis in 2002, recording solo sections. When - according to himself - Andersson was unable to continue to work with his businesspartners, he stopped with the Majestic-project. Together with some of the former bandmembers from Majestic, a new band was formed called Time Requiem. The album that wore the name Time Requiem was released in 2002. So far, this band has released three albums. Next to Time Requiem, Andersson also decided to start a new band with old friend Magnus Nilsson. Andersson and Nilsson grew up together and share a lot of musical influences. Now Andersson has gathered a lot of fans and status, he decided that it would be time to release a Best of so far-CD, that wears the title The Ultimate Andersson Collection CD. He felt the production was a little bit weak on some of the albums, so all the songs have been rerecorded. G√∂ran Edman (ex-Yngwie Malmsteen, ex-John Norum) does the vocals. Personal life He is the father of child singer Elias Andersson who took part in Talang 2007, the inaugural season of Swedish Got Talent series under the stage name \\"Sk√•nske Elias\\". His son reached the Top 8 finals stage of the competition, but didn't win the title.

He was born in the village of Freberga, in Stenby parish in √ñsterg√∂tland, and died in Oulu, in modern-day Finland. Childhood He was the son of a miller named J√∂ns Thordsson. At an early age his brilliance caught the attention of a monastery priest named Magnus Andreae, who gave him guidance and taught him. Unbeknownst to the boy's parents, the priest sent him to the Jesuit school in Braunsberg, which was specialized in educating boys for winning Scandinavia back from Protestantism. Seeking a position After seven years in Braunsberg, Johannes travelled across Europe. He visited Denmark in 1602, and in 1603, he was a dinner speaker at Bishop Piotr Tylicki in Krak√≥w. He made a short visit in Rome in 1604, but the climate forced him to return to Germany where he possibly won an M.A. in Ingolstadt, in 1605. He is also said to have received the title Po√´ta c√¶sarius (\\"poet of the Emperor\\") from emperor Rudolph II. Johannes moved further north to the Jesuit hostel in Danzig, he taught at a school in Braunsberg, and eventually, he opened a private school in Danzig, where he married Lucia Grothusen, the daughter of Arnold Grothusen, the teacher of king Sigismund. By doing a panegyric work, Genealogia Sigismundi, in 1608, he strove for receiving a better position from the king. When the king did not show the expected gratitude, Johannes returned to Sweden, hoping to reclaim his father's farm L√•ngebro, which had been confiscated by the State. Back in Sweden Since Charles IX of Sweden was suspicious towards Catholics and Jesuits, Johannes published a family tree of the kings ancestry, which showed how he was related to the many old dynasties of Europe. Through the intervention of his wife, Johannes received a repatriation permit, and after having given a vow of fealty, he received the position of professor of law and politics at Uppsala University. Professorship Johannes began a productive period in his life, which showed considerable learning. In Danzig, in 1605, his brethren among the Jesuits had informed the Swedish King Charles IX that Johannes had written a mocking poem on him. In order to convince everybody of his contempt for the Jesuits, he published two works. One was shorter and named Detecto Fraudis Jesuitic√¶, in 1610, and a longer in Swedish named Retorsion och genswars skrifft emoot then l√∂gn och skamlig dicht, which had already been published in German in 1609. He showed his newly acquired fidelity to the House of Vasa by a new genealogic work and by translating into Latin a number of writings against Sigismund of Poland (King Charles' brother). With fervour, he started to do research and to write on Swedish history, and his source criticism was a forerunner of modern history writing. In a rapid succession, he published the following works: *Chronicon episcoporum per Sueciam, etc. (1611) *Tumb√¶ veterum ac nuperorum apud Sveones regum, reginarum, ducum etc. *Sveopentaprotopolis, etc. *Specula (1612 (published in French, in 1655) *Retorsio imposturarum (1612) *Theatrum nobilitalis suecance (1616), which was the first publication of the pedigrees of the Swedish nobility. Beside this work, he also published older sources for historical studies. He published Ragnvald Ingemundsson's Latin translation of the law of Magnus Eriksson, in 1614, Ericus Olai's Swedish chronicle (1615), the Old Prose Chronicle and the Small Rhyme Chronicle, Adam of Bremen's description of Scandinavia and the beginning of the Large Rhyme Chronicle. It is evident that this large amount of work did not guarantee an even and high quality, but the many editions of his works that were printed testify to their popularity. As a professor and teacher at the university, he became very popular by his concerns for his students, and by teaching them according to the recent Braunberg methods. He also made plays in the Swedish language a popular activity for young people and he also made dramas himself. Conflict However, his hubris, boasting and waywardness caused difficulties with his colleagues at the university, especially since Johannes Rudbeck became his main enemy. The students were finally divided into two factions, one for him, and the other one against him. The Consistory at Uppsala became the battle ground for open fights and antics (partly with Messentius' support) that became so serious that the chancellor Axel Oxenstierna had to intervene. The two enemies were called to interrogation in Stockholm, in front of the Church council in July 1613. After an investigation, there was a settlement, but both professors were moved from Uppsala. Messenius was entrusted the keeping of the kingdom's old archives, and he was promoted to assessor of the Swedish court of appeal (Svea hovr√§tt), in 1614. Dramatist This was the time, when he began to write his plays, which were to influence Swedish drama during the following century. He almost completely rejected the so-called school drama, to which almost all previous Swedish plays had belonged. Instead, he rather followed the movement of the German Jakob Ayrer. However, his most successful decision was to write plays on Swedish history, as it was perceived in his time, i.e. including the Fornaldarsagas. His most influential works were: *Disa (1611, reprinted 7 times (1612‚Äì1740)). *Signill (1612, reprinted 9 times (1612‚Äì1740)). *Swanhuita (1613, reprinted 4 times (1635‚Äì1727)). *Blanckam√§reta (1614, reprinted 4 times (1614‚Äì1660s), on Blanka of Sweden and Margareta, a Danish princess who married king Birger Magnusson of Sweden. Encouraged by the success of his first two plays, he declared in the introduction of his third play that he intended to cover all of Sweden's history in 50 comedies and tragedies and make them public. Technically, his works were undeveloped and were a combination of ridiculous scenes with serious ones, and he had a certain feel for the presentation of dramatic effects. According to German tradition, he used people from the lower classes for comedy, but the scenes are usually disconnected from the rest of the play. The main play is organized as a series of dialogues that are loosely joined, and motivation and character depiction are considered to be very primitive. He paid close attention to the rendering of historic clothes, although the limited knowledge of his time showed its limitations in this respect. Occasionally, there are songs in the play, songs that belong to the best he has written, and they have been reprinted as late as 1879. The works he wrote in prison, Christmannus and Gustavus are less known, and incorrectly attributed to his son. They consist of summaries in dialogue of the history of the church in Sweden. In the spite of its weaknesses, Messenius' dramas are considered to be the most original and most patriotic in Sweden's older literature, and the only part of Swedish literature from this time to have been generally praised. Imprisonment In 1616, he was accused of conspiring with king Sigismund and the Jesuits. He was found guilty as charged, when he could not find twelve men who swore that he was innocent. He was sentenced to death in July 1616, but the king changed the sentence to prison, probably for life. In October 1616, he was transported to the desolate fortress Kajaani Castle at Finland near the Russian border, where he was harshly treated by its commander Erik Hara. He occupied himself with writing historical works and by doing research in Swedish source documents. Every once in a while, he sent pleas to king Gustav II Adolph and later to Christina's regency. In these pleas, he swore on his innocence, or referred to his works as reason for pardon. In 1635, he was moved to Oulu, and had his pension doubled. At this time, the government sent him the translator Erik Schroderus, to appraise himself of Messenius' monumental work Scondia illustrata, which treated Sweden's history from the deluge to Messenius' own time. When Messenius suspected that the government wanted to publish the work in its own name, he demanded freedom for his son, who was also imprisoned, and free passage for himself to wherever he wished. These demands offended the regency who threatened to send him back to Kajaneborg. Shortly, after this, Messenius died, and the government offered his widow 500 dollars for Scondia illustrata. However, she left the kingdom with the manuscripts, and it was her son who later returned the text to Sweden in order to have it published. However, it took a long time to publish the work, and it was only thanks to Johan Peringski√∂ld that it was published in folio 1700‚Äì1705. Considering the scholarly traditions of its time, and the conditions in which it was written, this monumental work can only be described as prominent. More than anyone else of his time, he mastered both Swedish and foreign historical literature. The seventh tome of Scondia, which describes the religious conflicts of John III of Sweden is a model for history writing. From his time in prison, there are also several other works, which are mostly still extant.

Plantains are picked green and fried, then mashed with salt, garlic, broth, and olive oil in a wooden pil√≥n (mortar and pestle). The goal is to produce a tight ball of mashed plantains that will absorb the attending condiments and have either pork cracklings (chicharr√≥n) or bits of bacon inside. It is traditionally served with fried meat and chicken broth soup. Particular flavors result from variations that include vegetables, chicken, shrimp, beef, or octopus packed inside or around the plantain orb. Origins Mofongo's roots lead to the African fufu, mixed with some Spanish and Ta√≠no influences. Fufu is made from various starchy vegetables and was introduced to the Caribbean by Africans in the Spanish New World colonies such as Cuba (fufu de pl√°tano), Dominican Republic (mang√∫), and Puerto Rico (mofongo) this also most likely includes Colombia (cayeye), Amazon region and Peru (tacacho). Mofongo first appeared in Puerto Rico's first cookbook, El Cocinero Puertorrique√±o, in 1859. In the same cookbook there are recipes for roasted mashed green and yellow plantains with butter, garlic and pork lard. Another is funche made with boiled mashed plantains, taro, pork lard served with sesame seed broth. Culture Mofongo evolved from fufu using the African method with vegetation available in the Caribbean. Plantains are most often used, but other starchy roots native to the island used by Ta√≠nos can also be used. Puerto Ricans have an obsession with fried food known collectively as cuchifrito in New York City and Kiosks in Puerto Rico. Spanish ingredients such as pork, garlic, broth, and olive oil are commonly used together in Puerto Rican cuisine and are found in staple dishes such as arroz con gandules, alcapurria, pasteles, habichuelas, reca√≠to, arroz junto, among others. The method of frying comes from the African side and is heavily used more than anyplace in the Caribbean. Broth is often made with chicken and sofrito. Sofrito is made with Spanish and Ta√≠no fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Method A pil√≥n to make mofongo Plantains and/or starchy roots are cut about half an inch thick and deep- fried. When done, the plantains/roots are crisp outside, but dense inside. The plantains/roots are then mashed in a wooden mortar and pestle called a pil√≥n made with mahogany or guaiacum, both native hardwoods. Broth, olive oil, garlic, and pork cracklings are added and mashed as well. The consistency of mofongo is much more stiff than fufu. In Africa, fufu is accompanied by a bowl of soup. In Puerto Rico, traditionally mofongo is accompanied by chicken broth soup, but braised meat has become more popular. Variations Shrimp mofongo from Rompeolas restaurant in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico It is also common in Puerto Rico to make mofongo with cassava (mofongo de yuca), taro and eddoe (mofongo de malanga y yaut√≠a), breadfruit (mofongo de pana), or a combination of cassava, ripe and green plantains (trifongo), ripe and unripe plantains (Bifongo or mofongo de amarillo). Mofongo stuffed with shrimp (camar√≥n in Spanish) is called camarofongo. Thanksgiving is an American holiday that has been adopted by Puerto Rico. Turkey is the main focus on every Thanksgiving table and is traditionally stuffed with bread. The traditional bread stuffing is replaced with mofongo, mofongo de yuca or mofongo de batata (plantain and sweet potato mofongo) in Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans' homes outside the commonwealth. Turkey stuffed with mofongo can be prepared with seasonings that are traditionally used for pork (garlic, black pepper, oregano, citrus, vinegar and annatto seeds), in which case it can be called pavochon. Frito-Lay produces MoFongo Snax, a combined plantain chips, cassava chips and pork rinds into one bag. Mofongo relleno is a stuffed variation of mofongo, which, according to Yvonne Ortiz, was first made in \\"Tino's Restaurant on the west coast of Puerto Rico\\" when seafood, abundant in the region, was placed inside the plantain ball with braised meat or more seafood poured over it. Nowadays, mofongo relleno is commonly stuffed with either seafood, poultry, or another meat. Mofongo outside of Puerto Rico \\"Puerto Rican matzoh ball\\"? From a U.S. booklet promoting tourism titled Puerto Rico, U.S.A. During the 1960s many Dominicans who feared the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo fled to Puerto Rico and New York City. Mofongo caught on quickly with Dominicans living in Puerto Rico and New York City. Mofongo has become a flagship food for many Dominican restaurants. Moca, Dominican Republic is known for adding chedder cheese. Bol√≥n de verde is a similar dish in Ecuador. The dish appears much later in Ecuadorian cuisine. Plantains are boiled or roasted, mashed with chicarr√≥n and cheese (queso blanco) formed into balls and fried. Mofongo has become popular among Colombians, Cubans and Dominicans living in the United States and anywhere large numbers of Puerto Ricans or Dominicans reside. Mofongo has become popular in high end Latin restaurants and Pan-Latin restaurants. Mofongo with Peruvian ceviche, South American churrasco and chimichurri, Cuban ropa vieja, Colombian ajiaco, M√©xican salsa verde and meat and so on. Debate Around early 2000s Mofongo became very popular amongst Dominicans. Dominicans have claimed mofongo as theirs and not an import from Puerto Rico. Clara Gonzalez, also known as Aunt Clara, is a Dominican chef and author. In her cookbook (Tradition Dominican cookery) claims that mofongo has a special place in the Dominicans' hearts and stomachs but can be traced back to Puerto Rico. But she goes on to say that roasted plantains mashed garlic with chicharr√≥n on the side may have been a pre mofongo and may have always been a part of Dominican gastronomic. These recipes come up in Dominican cookbooks in the 60's. They are debunked due to older Puerto Rican cookbooks with roasted mashed plantains with garlic, lard, and pork. Ramona Hernandez, director of the Dominican Studies Institute of the City University of New York, has been interviewed for many magazines on Dominican food and culture, she also says \\"mofongo is a dish borrowed from Puerto Rico that has much success with Dominicans\\". Both countries, along with Cuba, share much in food, language, music and traditions. Cuban singer Celia Cruz sang a merengue titled \\"Pun pun catalu\\" about the similarly among the three islands. She mentions how mashed plantains with chicharr√≥n is fuf√∫ in her native Cuba, mang√∫ in Quisqueya (Dominican Republic) and mofongo in Boriken (Puerto Rico). Mun2 television network aired a show titled \\"Where does mofongo come from? Puerto Rico or Dominican Republic?\\" The two hosts went around the streets of New York City asking Latin communities \\"Where does mofongo come from?\\" They found that the dish has its roots in African cooking but originated in Puerto Rico. In popular culture Food Network chef and host Guy Fieri featured mofongo from Benny's Seafood (in Miami, Florida) and from El Bohio (in San Antonio, Texas) on two separate episodes of his show Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. He liked the dish so much that he called it the \\"best fried thing I ever ate\\" on an episode of the show The Best Thing I Ever Ate.Video: Guy Fieri on Mofongo on Food Network Anne Burrell is featured in a Season 2 episode of Chef Wanted with mofongo as the opening dish challenge. Mofongo is also featured in Episode 7, Season 6 of the Food Network show, Beat Bobby Flay, where Bobby Flay's mofongo dish prevails over a mofongo dish prepared by Puerto Rican chef Giovanna Huyke. An episode of the Travel Channel's Man v. Food Nation, set in Harlem, showed the host Adam Richman visiting a Spanish Harlem restaurant called La Fonda Boricua, where they make a giant 12-plantain mofongo called the Mofongaso. Perhaps the oldest song mentioning mofongo is called Puertorrique√±o by Joe Valle and C√©sar Concepci√≥n. Singer Ismael Rivera with conductor Rafael Cortijo sang a plena song called \\"Mofongo Pelao\\" about mofongo. Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations featured mofongo in Season 2, Episode 2: Puerto Rico where Bourdain and his friend Andy Diaz dine on mofongo at the beach. \\"That is just a tower of goodness,\\" Bourdain says. On Saturday Night Live, David Ortiz (a recurring impression played by Kenan Thompson) frequently refers to the dish when describing his \\"big lunch\\".

It originally appeared as a novella in a 1966 issue of New Worlds; later, Moorcock produced an expanded version which was first published in 1969 by Allison & Busby. The title derives from the Gospel of John, Chapter 19, Verse 5: \\"Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them Behold the Man.\\" In the novel, Moorcock weaves an existentialist tale about Karl Glogauer, a man who travels from the year 1970 in a time machine to 28 AD, where he hopes to meet the historical Jesus of Nazareth.  Plot summary  The story begins with Karl's violent arrival in the Holy Land of AD 28, where his time machine, a womb-like, fluid-filled sphere, cracks open and becomes useless. By interpolating numerous memories and flashbacks, Moorcock tells the parallel story of Karl's troubled past in 20th century London, and tries to explain why he's willing to risk everything to meet Jesus. We learn that Karl has chronic problems with women, homosexual tendencies, an interest in the ideas of Jung, and many neuroses, including a messiah complex. Karl, badly injured during his journey, crawls halfway out of the time machine, then faints. John the Baptist and a group of Essenes find him there, and take him back to their community, where they care for him for some time. Since the Essenes witnessed his miraculous arrival in the time machine, John decides Karl must be a magus, and asks him to help lead a revolt against the occupying Romans. When he asks Karl to baptise him, however, the latter panics and flees into the desert, where he wanders alone, hallucinating from heat and thirst. He then makes his way to Nazareth in search of Jesus. When he finds Mary and Joseph, Mary turns out to be little more than a whore, and Joseph, a bitter old man, sneers openly at her claim to have been impregnated by an angel. Worse, their child Jesus is a profoundly intellectually disabled hunchback who incessantly repeats the only word he knows: Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Karl, however, is so deeply committed to the idea of a real, historical Jesus that, at this point, he himself begins to step into the role, gathering followers - carefully choosing ones whose names are identical with those attested in the Gospels- repeating what parables he can recall, and using psychological tricks to simulate miracles. When there's no food, he shows the people how to pretend to eat to take their minds off their hunger; when he encounters illness caused by hysteria, he cures it. Gradually, it becomes known that his name is Jesus of Nazareth. In the end, determined to live the story of Jesus to its decidedly bitter end, he orders a puzzled Judas to betray him to the Romans, and dies on the cross. His last, agonised words, however, are not Eloi, eloi, lama sabachthani, but the phonetically similar English it's a lie ... it's a lie ... it's a lie ... After Karl's death on the cross, the body is stolen by a doctor who believed the body had magical properties, leading to rumours that he did not die. The doctor is disappointed when the body begins to rot as any normal human would.  References to other Moorcock works  Karl Glogauer, in a slightly different incarnation, is the lead character in Moorcock's 1972 novel Breakfast in the Ruins - in the course of which he experiences no less than 17 additional incarnations, at various key moments of 20th Century history . In his series The Dancers at the End of Time, a similar time machine is used, which reveals that if a time traveller dies in the past, he is violently thrust back to the future, thus explaining Glogauer's reappearance. Moorcock refers to this phenomenon as the \\"Morphail Effect\\" in The Dancers at the End of Time. The issue of New Worlds containing the original novella Awards and nominations Behold the Man, in its short form, won the Nebula Award for Best Novella in 1967.\\"Nebula Award Winners: 1965 ‚Äì 2011\\", SFWA.

The gameplay is similar to Pac-Man, but a portion of the maze around the player-controlled character is enlarged as if being viewed through a square magnifying lens. Dung Beetles was ported to Atari 8-bit family and the TRS-80 Color Computer. The Color Computer version was sold by Tandy and renamed Mega-Bug. The Mega Bug port was programmed by Steve Bjork. Later versions for both the Apple II and Atari were named Tumble Bugs. The Atari version was re-released in 1983 by Gentry Software with another name change: Magneto Bugs. In Australia, the game was re-branded Bug Attack. It was also released for the NEC PC-6001. Gameplay The game concept and gameplay are based on Pac-Man, but features a much larger maze and a moving \\"magnifying rectangle\\" which makes it easier to see graphic detail of the main character and the opponents, but also obscures a small area of the map near the main character, making short- to medium-range navigation more difficult. In addition, whenever the main character passes through a part of the maze, it leaves a trail of dung. When a dung beetle finds this dung, it eats it and follows the trail; however, if the trail branches, or it encounters a point along the trail, it picks at random which branch to follow, thereby giving the player anywhere from a 50% to 66‚Öî% chance of losing the pursuer. The player can backtrack over his own trail (often necessary as the map can contain dead ends) creating false leads for his pursuers. Whenever the player is caught, the game plays a digitized voice saying, \\"We Gotcha!\\" This is the only use of voice in the game.

Biography Spencer is a Wadesboro, North Carolina native who, at the ages of 11 and 12, studied classical piano at the famed Beckwith Piano School in Charlotte, North Carolina. At the age of 13, he became the organist and pianist for the late Bishop J.H. Sherman of The Church Of God In Christ. In 1962, Spencer moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked with various bar bands including recording with Leroy Taylor and The 4k's as one of the first acts to sign with historic Shrine Records. In 1969, Spencer was bandleader for the Winstons, an R&B; group from Washington, D.C., whose song \\"Color Him Father\\" became a hit. The recording reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Billboard R&B; chart. For the B-side, the Winstons recorded \\"Amen, Brother\\", an instrumental interpretation of the gospel standard \\"Amen\\". From the 1980s onwards, the drum break was widely sampled.

The work is Bach's only church cantata scored for a solo soprano and trumpet. He composed it for general use (ogni tempo), in other words not for a particular date in the church calendar, although he used it for the 15th Sunday after Trinity: the first known performance was on 17 September 1730 in Leipzig. The work may have been composed earlier, possibly for an occasion at the court of Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, for whom Bach had composed the Hunting Cantata and the Shepherd Cantata. The text was written by an unknown poet who took inspiration from various biblical books, especially from psalms, and included as a closing chorale a stanza from the hymn \\"Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren\\". Bach structured the work in five movements, with the solo voice accompanied by a Baroque instrumental ensemble of a virtuoso trumpet, strings and continuo. While the outer movements with the trumpet express extrovert jubilation of God's goodness and his wonders, the central introspective aria, accompanied only by the continuo, conveys a \\"profound expression of commitment to God\\". He set the closing chorale as a chorale fantasia, the soprano sings the unadorned melody to a trio of two violins and continuo, leading to an unusual festive fugal Alleluja, in which the trumpet joins. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that the work, unusually popular among Bach's church cantatas, is unique in the demanded virtuosity of the soprano and trumpet soloist, and evidences \\"overflowing jubilation and radiant beauty\\".  History and words  Bach used the cantata in Leipzig for the 15th Sunday after Trinity on 17 September 1730. The prescribed readings for the Sunday came from the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul's admonition to \\"walk in the Spirit\\" (), and from the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew, which exhorts the faithful not to worry about material needs, but to seek God's kingdom first (). The author is unknown. Without any reference to the prescribed readings, he incorporates in the first movement ideas from , and , and in the central aria thoughts from and . The closing chorale is the fifth stanza of \\"\\", added to Johann Gramann's hymn in K√∂nigsberg in 1549. Bach used the same stanza in a different setting to close his cantata . Bach led the performance on 17 September 1730. Bach's manuscript indicates the 15th Sunday after Trinity \\"et in ogni tempo\\" (\\"and at any time\\"). The latter phrase indicates the possible general use of the work, with a cantata text that has no direct relevance to the scriptural readings. The dedication for the 15th Sunday was added later, indicating that the cantata was not intended for the specific occasion. Schloss Neu-Augustusburg in Wei√üenfels Bach composed BWV 51 during a period when he composed church cantatas only irregularly, some of them to complete his earlier cycles. According to the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff, Bach may have written the cantata shortly before 1730 for an unknown occasion. The performance material survived but does not reveal further detail, other than indicating one later performance. Hofmann sees a connection to the court of Wei√üenfels where a scoring of solo soprano and trumpet was popular, and assumes that the work may have been originally intended for a performance at court by a professional female singer. Bach had written two birthday cantatas for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. He was invited to the birthday celebration of 1729 and returned with the title of (court director of music of Saxe-Weissenfels), and Hofmann thinks a connection between the title and cantata \\"highly probable\\". Both the soprano part, which covers two octaves and requires a high C, and the solo trumpet part, which at times trades melodic lines with the soprano on an equal basis, are extremely virtuosic. The Bach scholar Alfred D√ºrr assumes that Bach had an unusually gifted singer, adding that a female voice was unlikely in conservative Leipzig. According to Joshua Rifkin, Christoph Nichelmann is a possible candidate because Bach being aware of his capabilities accepted him willingly to the Thomasschule and Nichelmann matriculated into the school three weeks before the first performance. The trumpet part was probably written for Gottfried Reiche, Bach's principal trumpeter at the time. The scoring is unique in Bach's cantatas, but was frequently used by Italian composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti. Bach's son Friedemann Bach arranged the work by adding a second trumpet and timpani. The cantata is one of only four sacred cantatas that Bach wrote for a solo soprano (if one excludes his arrangement of the cantata for solo bass and oboe , for flute and soprano BWV 82a) and no other vocal soloists (the others being , , and ), while he wrote several secular cantatas for solo soprano: , , , and .Liebergen, Patrick. New York: Alfred Publishing, 2008. pp 63-69.  Music  Structure and scoring = Bach structured the cantata in five movements and scored it for a soprano soloist and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of trumpets (Tr), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). The title of the autograph score reads: \\"Dominica 15 post Trinitatis / et / In ogni Tempo. / Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen. / √† / Soprano solo / 1 Tromba* / 2 Violino / Viola / e / Continuo / di / Joh:Seb:Bach\\". It is the only church cantata by Bach scored for solo soprano and trumpet. The duration is given as 20 minutes. In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for wind instrument and strings. The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown. = Movements = The music is concertante and virtuoso for both the trumpet and the soloist. The first aria and the concluding Alleluja are in the style of an Italian concerto. D√ºrr observes that the five movements are in five different musical forms: concerto, monody, variation, chorale fantasia and fugue. The scoring is richest in the outer movements (with the trumpet), and reduced to just continuo in the central aria.  1  The first aria, \\"\\" (Exult in God in every land), is in da capo form, with extended coloraturas. The theme, with a beginning in a triad fanfare, is well suited to the trumpet. It is first developed in a ritornello of the orchestra and then \\"constantly worked\\" in the soprano part.  2  The only recitative, \\"\\" (We pray at your temple), is first accompanied by the strings, a second part is secco but arioso. The second part develops the idea of \\"von seinen Wundern lallen\\" (chatter about His wonders) in coloraturas of rhythmical complexity.  3  The second aria, \\"\\" (Highest, renew Your goodness), is accompanied only by the continuo \\"quasi ostinato\\" which supports expressive coloraturas of the voice. The lines in the continuo, in constant movement in 12/8 time seem to constantly rise, towards the addressed \\"H√∂chster\\" (Highest) which appears as an octave jump down. Two extended melismas express gratefulness for being a child of God. The musicologist Julian Minchem notes that Bach is able to convey with modest means a \\"profound expression of commitment to God\\".  4  The chorale, \\"\\" (Glory, and praise with honor), is a chorale fantasia, with the soprano singing the unadorned melody to a three-part accompaniment of two violins and continuo.  5  The chorale leads without a break to a concluding fugal \\"Alleluja\\" with the trumpet, bringing the cantata to a particularly festive close. The movement begins with the soprano and the responding trumpet, before the other instruments come in to build a \\"fine display piece\\". Mincham summarizes: \\"The long flowing melismas leave one literally breathless with the sheer pleasure in, and energy generated through, the relationship with God.\\"  Recordings  The selection is taken from the listing provided by Bach Cantatas Website. The cantata was recorded by sopranos such as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (from 1948), Maria Stader (1959), Elly Ameling (1970), Edith Mathis (1972), Edita Gruberova (1979), Lucia Popp (1980), Helen Donath (1983), Elizabeth Parcells (1983), Monika Frimmer (1984), Barbara Hendricks (1989), Christine Sch√§fer (1999), Siri Thornhill (2007), and Natalie Dessay (2009).

Apart from their sheer size and elegance, they were famous for the huge collections of valuable paintings, statues, furniture, books, and armour that they housed, another reflection of the family's vast wealth and prominent position. The collections were confiscated by the Nazis in 1938, and the palaces were stripped and ruined during World War II. After the war, the heirs received little compensation. What remained of the buildings was sold off, or destroyed and replaced by modern office buildings. The history of these palaces and the art collections they contained is symbolic of the rise and fall of the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family.  The palaces  The five main Rothschild palaces (Palais Rothschild) in Vienna were: * Palais Albert Rothschild (demolished in 1954) * Palais Nathaniel Rothschild (demolished after 1945) * * Palais Rothschild (Prinz-Eugen-Stra√üe) * The Rothschild collections The extensive art collections of Louis and Alphonse de Rothschild had to be, in effect, given away by their heirs to the Republic of Austria. Complicated laws and bureaucratic red tape made a full restitution almost impossible. The heirs were forced by the state to sell off their belongings, since they were effectively insolvent. Since Austria regarded itself as a victim of Nazism, and not as one of the perpetrators, Austrian Jewish victims could barely appeal to the courts on their status. Much of the former Rothschild art collection was taken either to the Kunsthistorisches Museum (KHM) or to the Austrian Gallery in the Belvedere palace. In the late 1990s, due to outside pressure from the United States, a more thorough examination of its role and behaviour during the Second World War took place in Austria. After long and tedious negotiations, the Austrian government agreed in 1999 to return or pay for the roughly 250 Rothschild art treasures that were looted by the Nazis and absorbed into Austrian State Museums. The items were restituted to the heirs in 1999. Works from the Rothschild collection that used to be kept at the Kunsthistorisches Museum included: Count Philipp Ludwig Wenzel Sinzendorf by Hyacinthe Rigaud. Given in 1948 by Baronesse Clarisse de Rothschildt in memory of Baron Alphonse de Rothschildt as a \\"gift\\"; restituted in 1999 to the Rothschilds; given to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in 1999 by Bettina Loram Rothschild * Aelbert Cuyp, Landscape with Shepherd and Herd * Frans Hals, Tielemann Roostermann * Frans Hals, Portrait of a Man * Frans Hals, Portrait of a Woman * Hans de Jode, Muleteer * Gabriel Metsu, Girl and Officer * Isaac van Ostade, Stop at the inn * Hyacinthe Rigaud, Count Philipp Ludwig Wenzel Sinzendorf * David Teniers the Younger, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his gallery in Brussels * Jan Wynants, Landscape with Hunters File:Frans Hals - Portret van een man.jpgFrans Hals, Portrait of a Man File:Frans Hals - Portret van een vrouw.jpgFrans Hals, Portrait of a Woman In the √ñsterreichische Galerie Belvedere: * Heinrich Angelt, Portrait of a Woman  See also  * History of Jews in Austria * National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism  References  Further reading  * Gabriele Anderl, Alexandra Caruso (ed.).

Though occasionally equaled to or considered the successor of world music, an independent meaning of ethno jazz emerged around 1990 through the commercial success of ethnic music via globalization, which especially observed a Western focus on Asian musical interpretations. The origin of ethno jazz has widely been credited to saxophonist John Coltrane. Notable examples of ethno jazz include the emergence of jazz through New Orleanian and Cuban exchange, Afro- Cuban jazz of the 1940s and '50s, and the Arabic influence present in some American jazz from the 1950s and '60s.  Origins  Globalization = Globalization allowed for the rise of ethno jazz. The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century created new global trade networks that facilitated the spread of cross-cultural phenomena. Philip Bohlman, ethnomusicologist at the University of Chicago, described jazz as the \\"music of the African Diaspora,\\" describing the movement of ideas between the Caribbean, the United States, and Western Europe. Jazz in America grew out of racial tensions, and was seen by African Americans as a form of resistance. These ideas of resistance were spread and redefined through globalization. Globalization brought jazz to larger audiences through recordings and touring performances. Examples include a New Orleans band, the \\"Original Creole Orchestra\\", which toured Canada for the first time during the fall of 1914, and the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, which toured Europe in 1919 and was popular enough to continue touring England for a year.Whitehead, Kevin. \\"Jazz Worldwide\\". Jazz Educators Journal XXXIII/1 (July 2000), 39-50. Their music spread around the globe. Countries like China began jazz festivals with enough public support to become annual traditions. Musicians outside the United States were gaining popularity as well. One of the most respected non-American jazz musicians was guitarist Jean \\"Django\\" Reinhardt, who was born to a gypsy family and performed with famous musicians like Arthur Briggs, Bill Coleman, and Bill Arnold. His predominant style of playing was \\"gypsy jazz\\".Givan, Benjamin. The Music of Django Reinhardt. Arbor, MI: The University of Michigan Press, 2013. Traveling to and learning from other cultures was another factor that influenced the development of ethno jazz. For example, a variety of musicians like pianist Randy Weston, trumpeter Lester Bowie, drummer Max Roach, and multi-instrumentalists Yusef Lateef and Ornette Coleman had a fascination with other cultures' music. They went to Africa and studied different countries' melodies, rhythms, and harmonies, and adapted them into their jazz playing and compositions. Artists like Wayne Shorter and Marcus Miller found inspiration in the Maghreb jazz from North-West Africa https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUKjtcfRw60https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QvHydYquw. Intercultural musical exchange was well received internationally, inspiring many musicians to take on cross-cultural influences. Many of these musicians brought foreign artists as well as their musical styles back to their home countries, which resulted in a number of big jazz names hiring immigrants to perform in their ethno jazz projects.Nicholson, Stuart. Jazz and Culture in a Global Age. Lebanon, NH: University Press of New England, 2014. = North America = John Coltrane is generally understood to be the father of ethno jazz, having incorporated African, Middle Eastern, and Indian musical elements in many of his compositions. One of the first recognized examples of this fusion can be found in the African rhythm of his 1961 track \\"Dahomey Dance\\", which Coltrane discovered after a trip to Los Angeles earlier that year. \\"Amen\\" and \\"Sun Ship\\", recorded four years later and released posthumously on the album Sun Ship, both feature extensive improvisation on commonly used conga and bongo rhythmic patterns, as opposed to more common, chordal improvisation, with the vocal quality of Coltrane's tenor saxophone intentionally paralleling the sound of an African horn he had heard in a Kenyan recording from the late 1930s.Simpkins, p. 168. His 1967 avant-garde track \\"Ogunde\\", named for Nigerian musician Hubert Ogunde, was recorded in the free, lyrical style of the same name, which embodied a movement to return to traditional African music uninfluenced by European elements. Coltrane's Afro- Eastern sound is best exemplified in \\"Africa\\", from the album Africa/Brass, which was created after drawing rhythmic and timbral inspiration from many African records.Simpkins, p. 130. Coltrane's incorporation of Indian and Middle Eastern styles in his music was more limited, but still prevalent. In 1961, he stated his intention to use the \\"particular sounds and scales\\" of India \\"to produce specific emotional meanings, as in [his own composition] 'India'\\".Simpkins, p. 137.Liner notes to Live at the Village Vanguard, John Coltrane, Impulse Records, CD, 1962. Both \\"Impressions\\" and the chords of \\"So What\\", the all-time most popular jazz track, recorded with Miles Davis, are centered on scales Coltrane invented as a mix of Indian ragas and Western scales. In another collaboration with Miles Davis, Coltrane dropped in on the recording of \\"Teo\\", where his playing sounds remarkably more \\"Middle Eastern\\" than on previous Davis records,Simpkins, p. 128. and on the lead sheet to his own composition \\"All or Nothing At All\\", Coltrane reportedly handwrote the phrase \\"Arabic feeling\\".Simpkins, p. 163. = Latin and South America = One of the most popular genres of ethno jazz is Latin jazz, characterized by a combination of jazz elements with traditional Latin American music. In addition, instrumentation plays an important role. While standard jazz bands feature a rhythm section (piano, guitar, bass and drums) and winds (saxophone, trumpet or trombone), Latin music makes use of many more percussive instruments, such as timbales, congas, bongos, maracas, claves, guiros, and vibes, which were first played in a Latin setting by Tito Puente. Musicians combine these two instrumentations to create a Latin jazz sound.Roberts, John Storm. Latin Jazz: The First of the Fusions, 1880s to Today. New York: Schirmer Books, 1999. Cuba and Brazil were among the first countries to develop this music, and thereby some of the most influential.  Cuba  Afro-Cuban music developed in Cuba from West African origins, and is characterized by the use of Cuban claves. There are two kinds of clave: the rumba and the son, both of which are typically used in a two-measure pattern in cut time. Both add a base, mood, and flow to the music, creating polyrhythms and asymmetry within their traditional settings. When combined with jazz, which was more symmetrical and featured a heavy back beat, a new Cuban-jazz fusion was created, known as Afro-Cuban jazz or Cubop. The musicians known for planting the seeds of Cubop were Mario Bauz√°, a Cuban trumpeter, and Frank Grillo, a Cuban maraca player who was also known as Machito. Both immigrated to the United States, where they performed Cuban music and were influenced by jazz. One of the most important collaborations was when Bauz√° was working with famous jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. Bauz√° introduced Dizzy to Chano Pozo and Chiquitico, conga and bongo players, respectively; together they began a big band that combined jazz and Cuban music. In 1946 they performed the first Afro-Cuban jazz concert in Carnegie Hall. The concert was a sensation because it combined Latin syncopated bass lines, percussion drumming, cross rhythms, and bebop language over a Latin feel. Some of the most famous recordings from this band were \\"Cuban Be\\", \\"Cuban Bop\\", \\"Algo Bueno\\", and \\"Manteca\\".Giddins, Gary, and Scott DeVeaux. Jazz. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2015.  Brazil  Brazilian jazz has its roots in samba, which comes from a combination of African dances and march rhythms from the 19th century. The samba rhythm is characterized by an emphasis on the second beat of each measure. Unlike Cuban music, this style does not have a clave pattern, resulting in a more relaxed sensation and less tension. Brazilian music was introduced to the United States around the 1930s by Hollywood, with songs like \\"Tico-Tico no Fub√°\\" and \\"Brazil\\", but lost popularity over the coming years until its revival in 1962, when saxophonist Stan Getz and guitarist Charlie Byrd recorded the album Jazz Samba with Verve Records after Byrd was inspired by a trip to Brazil; the track \\"Desafinado\\" reached #1 status in the pop charts and won a Grammy for Best Solo Performance. In the 1950s, pianist Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim, guitarist Jo√£o Gilberto, and poet Vinicius de Moraes introduced a style similar to samba called bossa nova, which translates to \\"new flair\\" or \\"new beat\\". This music is slower, text-based, melancholic, and has a mellow feeling. Bossa nova did not use the heavy percussive instruments in samba and was much softer. Gilberto's \\"Bim-Bom,\\" often described as the first bossa nova song, was inspired by Brazil's post-WWII modernization movement in the 1950s. In 1958, Jobim and de Moraes recorded \\"Chege de Saudede,\\" but it was Gilberto's version that launched the bossa nova movement. After the release of Jazz Samba, Stan Getz invited Gilberto to record an album together. They released Getz/Gilberto in 1964, which also featured Gilberto's wife, Astrud Gilberto, whose soft vocal style became definitive of bossa nova. = The Balkans = Milcho Leviev was the first composer to definitively bridge Bulgarian folk music and jazz, the synthesis of which is evident in tracks from the early 1960s, such as \\"Blues in 9\\" and \\"Blues in 10\\", respectively in the and meters common to Bulgarian folk dances. The former of the two makes use of the provikvane (a Bulgarian folk element characterized by an ascending leap to the leading tone of the scale) and interplay between the two genres via call and response. Throughout \\"Blues in 9\\", the call is commonly a modal portion of a Bulgarian folk tune, answered by its response in the style of pentatonic blues. = Eastern Europe = Jazz was introduced to Moscow by Valentin Parnakh in 1922. This event was followed by the arrest, imprisonment, and deportation of many jazz musicians throughout the Soviet Union for their Western influence, as ordered by Joseph Stalin. This only made the genre more appealing to young musicians, resulting in multiple \\"underground\\" jazz bands and orchestras, among the first of which was a handful of Azerbaijani ensembles directed from 1926 by A. Ionannesyani and Mikhail Rol'nikov. Ethno jazz was more recently represented in the Eurovision Song Contest by Georgia with entries such as \\"Three Minutes to Earth\\" by The Shin and Mariko Ebralidze in the 2014 contest and \\"For You\\" by Iriao in the 2018 contest. = The Middle East = Much of the Western music introduced to Iran (and subsequently neighboring Middle Eastern countries) after World War II by the modernization policies of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was met with censorship similar to that what had occurred in the Soviet Union decades before. Jazz became popular contraband after the 1979 Revolution. In 1994, saxophonist and bandmaster Peter Soleimanipour received the first musical permit after the revolution, which led to public performances of his band Atin, who played jazz standards alongside original compositions that combined Iranian musical elements with jazz. Soleimanipour has described his music as talfiqi (trans. \\"fusion\\"), explicitly avoiding the label of \\"jazz artist\\", while incorporating African and Latin rhythms, Iranian instrumentation, and jazz elements on works as recent as his 2003 album Egosystem.

Al Rabia's Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 551. Al Rabia was an executive with Kuwait's national airline before his wrongful arrest and extradition. He had studied in the United States, and described himself as an America-phile. He is also a philanthropist, along with members of his family, and they regularly followed-up to observed in person the charitable enterprises they donated to. He had routinely made preliminary and follow-up field trips to check on projects they had donated to. In 2001, he described traveling to Afghanistan, for charitable purposes. Al Rabia was to face charges in 2008 before a Guantanamo military commission, but all charges were dropped in 2009. In September 2009, Al Rabia's habeas corpus petition concluded, and US District Court Judge ordered that he be released \\"forthwith\\". That release occurred on December 9, 2009. Al Rabiah's lawyers called on President Barack Obama to apologise on behalf of the United States and provide \\"appropriate compensation\\" to al Rabiah for his ordeal. Guantanamo military commission On October 22, 2008, the Office of Military Commissions filed charges against Fouad Al Rabia and Fayiz Al Kandari. On August 12, 2009, Fouad Al Rabia's Defense Counsel, Lieutenant Commander Kevin Bogucki asserted his clearance for travel to Kuwait was being withheld. All charges were dropped in 2009. Fouad al Rabia's weight The documents published when charges were proposed against Fouad al Rabia included the weights recorded by the camp's medical staff. Torture CNN published an article based on interviews with Fouad and other former Guantanamo captives, entitled \\"Former Guantanamo inmates tell of confessions under 'torture'\\". Al Rabiah told Jenifer Fenton he was tortured by his initial Northern Alliance captors, tortured in the Kandahar detention facility, tortured in the Bagram Collection Point, and tortured in Guantanamo. He told her he had been interrogated over 200 times, including \\"lots and lots of torture\\". Al Rabiah showed Fenton a copy of a two-page letter found in Tora Bora that he was tortured into confessing he wrote. The letter's author wrote that he and his son Abdullah lead an attack in Afghanistan in 1991. However, while Al Rabiah's son is named Abdullah, he was only one year old in 1991. Al Rabiah told Fenton he started to confess to all his interrogators accusations after he was asked \\"Would you like to go home a drug addict?\\" He told Fenton that he regarded this as one of the threats, that triggered his false confessions. Repatriation On May 12, 2007, the Kuwait Times reported that Kuwait and the USA concluded negotiations regarding the repatriation of the remaining Kuwaiti captives. Immediate release On September 17, 2009, US District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ordered that Al Rabia could no longer be detained under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force and ordered the government to release him from detention at Guantanamo Bay He was repatriated on December 9, 2009.

The character was depicted briefly a member of the X-Men. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Leinil Francis Yu, he first appeared in X-Men vol. 2 #100 (May 2000).He is the first Indian member of the X-Men. An Indian pyrokinetic, he has no connection to the previous X-Men characters called Thunderbird. He is a vegan and was originally intended to be called Agni, after the Hindu god of fire. Fictional character biographyEarly life= Neal Shaara comes from an affluent family in Kolkata, where his father is the city's chief of police. His family also owned a large tea estate, where they all lived. He was popular among girls because of his good looks. When his journalist brother Sanjit disappears, Neal decides to investigate, against his parents' wishes. Neal is shadowed by his father's best detective Karima Shapandar, and after Karima saves him from a group of thugs, the two began a romantic relationship while they search for Neal's missing brother.X-Men #100. Marvel Comics. =Karima turned into a Prime Sentinel= They are ultimately captured by the villain Bastion, who plans to turn them into Prime Sentinels as he has done to Sanjit. However, the shock of the transformation causes his latent mutant powers to manifest, the power to generate and control solar plasma and heat.X-Men #103. Marvel Comics. Sanjit is able to disable the other Sentinels, but is severely wounded in the attempt. Karima, who is able to temporarily rebel against her programming, tells Neal to leave her, as her own transformation process commences, which will result in her killing him when the transformation is complete.X-Men #104-105. Marvel Comics. =Joining The X-Men= Neal was now lost, alone and with strange powers that he neither comprehends nor wants. Neal goes to see family friend Moira MacTaggert on Muir Island, and he meets the X-Men, although he does not know this when he first meets them. Later, the X-Men revealed themselves, when they used their powers to stop Cable when his techno-organic virus runs out of control. Neal is initially frightened, but is eventually convinced to join the team. He chooses the codename Thunderbird, becoming the third bearer of that name so after the Proudstar brothers. He later adopted a more armored yellow and red uniform with wire mesh padding. =Psylocke= While with the X-Men, Thunderbird struggles with his fear of killing or hurting someone with his plasma. In addition, he also falls in love with the X-Man Psylocke, even though she is in a relationship with Archangel. Thunderbird and Psylocke often engage in flirtatious behavior in front of Archangel, who makes his displeasure felt to Thunderbird. The couple eventually breaks up, and Psylocke pursues a romantic relationship with Thunderbird.Weiner, Robert G. (October 17, 2007).

During one of their conversations, he says that though he is happy with Psylocke, he still retains his feelings for Karima, who is a Prime Sentinel. Thunderbird's lack of control over his powers often caused problems during combat. He refrains from using them on his opponents due to the fear of killing them. Archangel, who bears animus toward him because of his breakup with Betsy, mocks him and questions his place in the X-Men. =X-Treme X-Men= A short while, Thunderbird and five other X-Men formed a splinter group of X-Men dubbed the X-Treme X-Men, cutting all ties with the rest of the team while searching for Destiny's Diaries. He trains with Psylocke to gain better control of his powers, and learns to use only a small amount of plasma to blind or singe his opponents. Psylocke dies at the hands of Vargas, leaving behind a grief- stricken Thunderbird. For a time he is seen working with the X-Man from the future, Lucas Bishop, another mutant with energy-related powers, in an attempt to overcome his fears and gain greater control over his powers. He comes to think of Bishop as his mentor. After Psylocke's death, he begins questioning the purpose of his life. Bishops tells him that while none of the X-Men are mentioned in the history books of his time, Neal is, a revelation that greatly motivates Neal. =Lifeguard= Some time after, Neal started a relationship with Heather Cameron, who was also known as Lifeguard. She and her brother Davis (who would become Slipstream) joined the offshoot group of the X-Men. After the inter-dimensional Invasion at Madripoor by the villain Khan, Thunderbird and Lifeguard left to search for her brother Slipstream, who left the team.Claremont, Chris (w), Larocca, Salvador (a). X-Treme X-Men #1-6. Marvel Comics. =X-Corporation= Neal and Heather would later be seen as a member of the X-Corporation in Singapore, although Slipstream was nowhere to be seen. However this was short-lived as there was a synchronized attack on several of the X-Corporation offices after the catastrophic events of M-Day, leading Cyclops to call for the disbanding of all offices. Whether they aborted their search for Slipstream, or did find him, is not yet known.X-Treme X-Men #16. Marvel Comics. =Current status= In the \\"Decimation\\" storyline, it is seen in the 198 files, that he is one of the few mutants to retain their powers after the events of M-Day.. During the X-Men battle versus X-Man, aka Nate Grey, Jean Grey called help of all current and former X-Men to assist in the fight. Neal Shaara was one of those who joined the final fight. Though most of those who were at the end fight appeared in the Age of X-Man crossover, Neal was not seen. Powers and abilities Thunderbird has the ability to transform the molecules of his body into solar plasma, enabling him to convert portions of himself into thermodynamic energy furnaces that release luminescent radiance, pyrotechnic displays, concentrated plasma beams, shaped plasma charges that can deflect solid matter or displace volumes of air on impact for a heatless release of concussive force, and explosive thrust from his legs for flight or projection of focused blasts, flashes, or explosive spheres. Because plasma is a superheated, ionized state of matter, it can melt or destroy most objects, with the exception of adamantium. Thunderbird can also use his power to generate sufficient propulsive thrust to fly at supersonic speeds. In his initial appearances, Thunderbird is relatively unskilled in the use of his powers, but receives further training from Psylocke and Bishop. During his time being mentored by Bishop, he achieves greater control over his powers, learning how to use his blasts to only single targets. He can also use only a small amount to create a blinding flash.

With Dykes possessing copious amounts of talent at a young age rising into grade as a 16-year-old. Dykes was selected in the Australian under 15's and 17's squads and was seen as one of the Sharks most talented juniors ever to rise through the ranks. =1995= Dykes made his first grade d√©but for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks as an 18-year-old in the 1995 season (11 March, round 1) against the Newcastle Knights. With several impressive performances for the club he quickly cemented his position in John Lang's outfit as a key impact player off the interchange bench. =1996-01= After spending the 1996 ARL season as a utility player off the bench, Dykes was given the chance to prove himself as a regular starter in the halves.

He served as the sixth Governor of Illinois from 1834 to 1838, the only Whig to ever govern the state. Before becoming governor he served four terms in the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat. Early and family life Duncan's house in Jacksonville Duncan was born in Paris, Kentucky. He served in the War of 1812 and the Black Hawk War as a soldier. Career Duncan moved to Illinois in the year of its statehood, 1818, settling in Brownsville in Jackson County. Here, he was a member of the Masonic fraternity at Hiram Lodge No. 8. Duncan moved to Jacksonville in 1830. Before becoming governor, he had a notable political career. Duncan first won election as a delegate in the Illinois House of Representatives, serving from 1825 to 1829. Voters then elected him to represent Illinois's at-large congressional district in Congress in 1826, as he defeated abolitionist and multi-term Congressman Daniel Pope Cook. Jacksonian Democrats were ascendant in Illinois politics, and Cook had fallen out of favor with them when he voted against Andrew Jackson in the contingent election of 1825. Duncan successfully ran as a Jacksonian, winning 6,322 votes to Cook's 5,619.Elizabeth Duncan Putnam (1921), The Life and Services of Joseph Duncan, Illinois State Historical Society, 121-3. Google Books, He was re-elected twice to the at-large district and in 1832 won a fourth term representing the newly created 3rd district. Duncan first went to Congress as a Jacksonian Democrat, but his relationship with President Jackson's party worsened during his career in Congress. By 1834 he voted more often with the opposition Whigs. His final break with the Democrats occurred in June 1834, when he voted to recharter the Bank of the United States.Putnam , 145-146. With the help of Democrats unaware of Duncan's change in politics, Duncan was elected governor that year without campaigning or even visiting Illinois.Putnam, 144. In his mid-term address two years later, Governor Duncan asked the legislature to pass a state Internal Improvements Act, which would authorize the construction of numerous roads, railroads, bridges, river and harbor improvements, and canals across the state. Attempting to deal with the national economic Panic of 1837 and seeing the costs of internal improvements piling up, Duncan asked the legislature to repeal the program. Legislators ignored the governor, adding even more projects to the program. While the number of improvements were few, the program accumulated debt that almost forced the state into bankruptcy. The first bill for the $15 million that had been borrowed to pay for the program was more than double the state's annual revenue. The debt from the Internal Improvements Act would not be fully paid off until 1882, costing the state more in interest than in the dollar amounts to actually build the so-called improvements throughout the state. It was also during Duncan's tenure that the state capital was moved from Vandalia, Fayette County, Illinois, to its current location, Springfield, Sangamon County, Illinois. This was controversially done in large part by the successful leadership skills of Springfield's representatives, known as the \\"Long Nine,\\" one of whom was Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln and the eight other members of his delegation won the capital by trading their votes to win the capital for Springfield for projects for other representatives' districts. This led to the failed internal improvements program. Duncan became the Whig candidate for governor in 1842, and his initial opponent died in May, but voters nonetheless elected Democrat Thomas Ford as Illinois' 8th governor, and Democrats also won control over both houses of the Illinois legislature. Death and legacy Duncan died in Jacksonville. Interment is at Diamond Grove Cemetery there. Duncan's home in Jacksonville, the Joseph Duncan House, has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/America/United_States/Illinois/_Texts/DRUOIH/Central_Illinois/16*.html ReferencesExternal links * Category:1794 births Category:1844 deaths Category:Governors of Illinois Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois Category:Illinois state senators Category:American people of the Black Hawk War Category:American people of Scottish descent Category:Politicians from Jacksonville, Illinois Category:Illinois Democrats Category:Illinois Jacksonians Category:Whig Party state governors of the United States Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:People from Paris, Kentucky Category:American military personnel of the War of 1812 ","title":"Joseph Duncan (politician)"},{"id":"2739405","text":"Gareth Owen Llewellyn (born 27 February 1969), is a Welsh former rugby union player who gained a record 92 caps for Wales as a lock.

The company was named after the famous Market Street of that city, which formed the core of its transportation network. Over the years, the company was also known as the Market Street Railroad Company, the Market Street Cable Railway Company and the United Railroads of San Francisco. The company should not be mistaken for the current Market Street Railway, which is named after its predecessor but is actually a legally unconnected non-profit support group for San Francisco's heritage streetcar lines.  History  Sanborn Fire Insurance Map The franchise for what would become the Market Street Railway was granted in 1857 to Thomas Hayes. The line was the first horsecar line to open in San Francisco, opened on July 4, 1860, as the Market Street Railroad Company.Market Street Railway (nonprofit) (2004). A Brief History of Market St. Railway. Retrieved September 23, 2005. Section The Market Street Railroad Company, 1860-1882 A few years later, the line was converted to steam power utilizing steam dummy locomotives pulling a trailer car. Four Portland gauge tank locomotives were built by San Francisco's Albion Foundry. Locomotives #1 and #4 were long with engine, baggage and passenger compartments driven by the front wheel only 0-2-2T. Locomotives #2 and #3 were 0-4-0Ts with a baggage compartment. Both types pulled double-truck trailers with seating for 64 passengers. Baldwin Locomotive Works built two 0-4-0T steam dummies (C/N 5004 & 5009) in 1880 to operate over the standard-gauge railway extension from Valencia Street to Castro Street until 1888. A United Railroads of San Francisco standard car circa 1905Following the opening of the cable hauled Clay Street Hill Railroad in 1873, pressure grew to convert the city's horsecar lines to the new form of traction. In 1882, Leland Stanford and associates bought the Market Street Railroad Company and converted its lines to cable haulage. In the process, the company's name was changed to the Market Street Cable Railway Company. This company was to grow to become San Francisco's largest cable car operator. At its peak, it operated five lines all of which converged into Market Street to a common terminus at the Ferry Building; during rush hours a cable car left that terminus every 15 seconds.Robert Callwell and Walter Rice (2000). Of Cables and Grips: The Cable Cars of San Francisco. Published by the Friends of the Cable Car Museum. ISBN unknown. Bond coupons issued by Market Street Railway Co., circa 1900 from the San Francisco Cable Car Museum However transit technology was still moving on, and the new electric streetcar quickly proved to cheaper to build and operate than the cable car, and capable of climbing all but San Francisco's steepest hills. In 1893, Stanford died and the company was taken over by the Southern Pacific Railroad. The company was again renamed to the Market Street Railway Company, and began the process of converting its lines to electric traction. In 1895 the company placed a newspaper advertisement in The San Francisco Examiner offering horse cars for $20 ($10 without seats).San Francisco Examiner, September 22, 1895, pg. 19. Many of these became the basis for the impromptu community built from streetcars called Carville-by-the-Sea. Conversion to electricity was resisted by opponents like Rudolph Spreckels and other property owners who objected to what they saw as ugly overhead lines on the major thoroughfares of the city center. At 5:12 am on April 18, 1906, those objections were swept away as the great San Francisco earthquake struck. The race to rebuild the city allowed the company to replace all but the steepest of its cable car lines with electric streetcar lines. Market Street Railway Co. stock certificate c1920By this stage, the company had changed hands again, and become the United Railroads of San Francisco (URR). Over the years many independent lines had been absorbed, including the Clay Street Hill Railroad, the San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway, the Presidio & Ferries Railway, and the Ferries and Cliff House Railway. Ironically the earthquake that brought so many benefits to the company also sowed the seeds of its demise, as the independent Geary Street, Park & Ocean Railway was acquired by the city and became in 1912 the beginning of the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni). Horsecars were finally withdrawn from city streets on June 3, 1914. By 1918, and assisted by the construction of several tunnels under the city's hills, Muni was in direct competition with the URR down the length of Market Street. The two operators each operated their own pair of rail tracks down that thoroughfare, which came to be known as the 'roar of the four'. The two Market Street Railway tracks were on the inside and the two San Francisco Municipal Railway tracks were on the outside. Competition, labor troubles and a bad accident in 1918 led to the reorganisation of the URR, to re-emerge again as the Market Street Railway Company. This continued to operate electric streetcars throughout the city, the Powell St. cable car lines, and a growing fleet of buses. But relations were not good with the city, who controlled their franchises, and on May 16, 1944, after defeating the proposal six times previously, voters elected to purchase the operative properties of the Market Street Railway for $7.5 million and the company sold all its assets and operations to Muni.

NBC had originally announced that Scrubs would end after its seventh season, containing a reduced 18 episodes. However, the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike ended up cutting the show's episodes down to 11, and Scrubs ended its run on NBC with a total of 150 episodes. The cast returned to film an additional 18 episodes, which were aired as Season 8 by ABC, with much of the story coming to a close, and definitive though somewhat flexible endings for the characters. The one- hour season finale, \\"My Finale\\", which was originally planned to also be the series finale, ranked third in the ratings and was watched by 5.1 million viewers, 2.1 adults 18-49 rating. The episode garnered mostly positive response from the viewers as well as critics. With speculation mounting over a possible ninth season that would focus on new characters and perhaps a new setting, ABC announced on May 15, 2009 that it renewed Scrubs for a ninth season called Scrubs: Med School. The season premiered on December 1, 2009. Donald Faison and John C. McGinley are the only original cast members returning as regular characters, while Zach Braff appeared in six episodes. Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn and Ken Jenkins returned as guest stars, while Judy Reyes did not appear at all. In addition to the regular episodes, a special called \\"My Charlie Brown Christmas\\" was created by Daniel Russ and Ryan Levin for the Scrubs 2003 Christmas party, which is a re-cut and re-dub of A Charlie Brown Christmas, starring the cast of Scrubs. As a general rule, all series episode titles begin with the word \\"My\\", unless the bulk of the episode is narrated by someone other than J.D., in which case they are named \\"His Story\\", \\"Her Story\\", or \\"Their Story\\", with Roman numerals denoting subsequent episodes by the same name. During Season 9, episode titles started with the word \\"Our\\" instead of \\"My\\". A total of 182 episodes of Scrubs were broadcast over nine seasons.

HistoryHMS Royal George= In 1839 Charles Pasley, a colonel of the Royal Engineers, used sealed barrels of gunpowder to demolish the wreck of the Royal George, which sank at moorings at Spithead in 1782. =John G. Foster= Shortly after the American Civil War, Brevet Maj. Gen. John G. Foster, a West Point trained engineer, became one of the first acknowledged experts in underwater demolition. In 1869, he wrote a definitive treatise on the topic and became widely recognized as the authority on underwater demolition. Many of his theories and techniques were still in practice during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I. =Christian J. Lambertsen= In 1940, Christian J. Lambertsen demonstrated his semi-closed circuit rebreather, the Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit (LARU), for the U.S. Navy in connection with his proposal for the formation of military teams of underwater swimmers. Major Lambertsen served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from 1944 to 1946 where he did a detached service in underwater operations with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). After joining OSS, he was vital in establishing the first cadres of U.S. military operational combat swimmers during late World War II. His responsibilities included training and developing methods of combining self-contained diving and swimmer delivery for the OSS \\"Operational Swimmer Group\\". Following World War II, he trained U.S. forces in methods for submerged operations, including composite fleet submarine / operational swimmers activity. =Draper L. Kauffman= In June 1943, Draper L. Kauffman organized the first U.S. Navy Demolition Teams. The original purpose of these teams was to map and record conditions in amphibious landing zones and to demolish obstacles in water which would prevent vehicles from landing during invasions. Underwater demolition specialists may still be referred to as underwater demolition teams. Today, various special operations units use aspects of demolition diving. Most prominently carried out by Navy SEALs and UCT divers. Research Research into diver safety related to underwater blast continues at the US Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory.

A barnyard or farmyard is an enclosed or open yard adjoining a barn,Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009. Barn. n. and, typically, related farm buildings, including a farmhouse. Enclosed barnyards are usually formed by a combination of fences and farm structures. Description  A barnyard of the 19th century was fenced-in an area of about or more; modern barnyards per se may not be as large, but agricultural properties still may use a perimeter fence around areas of concentrated animal management to help contain any that may get loose. The barnyard is the domain of the mules, horses, and other working animals, as well as fowl and working pets, such as barn cats. On small farms, pasture animals such milk goats or a dairy cow may stay in the barnyard when not in the fields. Depending on climate, barnyards may contain trees for shade. A water source is also common; the watering trough in past times was supplied by water from a hand driven well, with the water kept in wooden or metal containers. The water trough was filled daily, perhaps by a pitcher pump, or by windmill power. Pumping the trough full, by hand, was often the chore of farm children. In modern times, a trough may be hand-filled with a hose, or an automatic water fountain designed for livestock may be installed in one or more locations. A large barn is often central to the barnyard, storing farm equipment, and providing stalls for the farm animals. In traditional designs, a hayloft often occupies the second floor, and a barn cupola caps off the hayloft. In some barns, the loft has a series of openings in the floor just above the stalls to send hay into the mangers below. In some places, the barn houses a corn crib and a corn sheller. Feed storage, however, is also a boon to mice and rats, so farmers often keep barn cats to control vermin.

Established in 1936, the museum is named after its founder, Henri van Abbe, who loved modern art and wanted to enjoy it in Eindhoven. As of 2010, the collection of the museum housed more than 2700 works of art, of which about 1000 were on paper, 700 were paintings, and 1000 were sculptures, installations and video works. The museum has an area of 9,825 m2 and holds one of the largest collections of paintings in the world by El Lissitzky. It also has works by Pablo Picasso and Wassily Kandinsky.  History  The museum's original collection was bought by the Eindhoven city council in 1934 in an agreement with Henri van Abbe, a private collector and local cigar manufacturer. In return for buying some of his collection, the Van Abbe factory paid for and donated the museum building, which opened in 1936. The city had architect Alexander Kropholler design a building that is a symmetrical suite of galleries in the traditionalist style. The museum name was given in publications as \\"Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum\\" until approximately 1990 and as \\"Van Abbemuseum\\" after that time.Based on search of Library of Congress catalog, September 17, 2015. The new extension. View to the southeast, with the City Hall (background right). As the building had become far too small for modern demands, a new extension to the building, including a tower, was designed by Abel Cahen; it was inaugurated in 2003 by queen Beatrix.  Collection  The original collection contained works by Jan Sluijters, Carel Willink and Isaac Isra√´ls amongst others, mostly Dutch and Belgian contemporary works. The museum also bought other artworks from founder Henri van Abbe before his death in 1940. The collection developed most under the directorships of Edy de Wilde and Rudi Fuchs. While De Wilde bought the classical modernist works by Picasso etc., Fuchs bought works from artists of his own generation, in particular conceptual work from the US and German painting. The current director, Charles Esche has pursued a more geographically diverse collecting policy concentrating on works from central and eastern Europe including Nedko Solakov, Mladen Stilinovic, Wilhelm Sasnal, Artur Zmijewski as well as video works by Israeli artist Yael Bartana. More recent acquisitions include pieces by Pablo Picasso, Wassily Kandinsky and Piet Mondrian. The museum is also internationally renowned for having one of the largest collections of works by El Lissitzky. The Van Abbemuseum also houses the collection of posters made by the Situationist Jacqueline de Jong in Paris during May 1968.  Administration  Charles Esche is the director of the Van Abbemuseum.

It was later released for the Xbox on December 5, 2002. It is the sequel to the 2001 professional wrestling video game Legends of Wrestling. Legends II contains 25 wrestlers that were not in the first game, though also excludes Rob Van Dam, presumably because he had recently been signed to a WWE contract. The game did contain Eddie Guerrero, however, who, although unemployed at the time, re- signed with WWE when the game was released. The game was also released on the Game Boy Advance on November 25, 2002. It was the last game developed by Acclaim's Salt Lake City studio before its closure in December 2002. A sequel, Showdown: Legends of Wrestling, was released in 2004. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions included video interviews with many of the legends featured in the game while the European version of the game included four exclusive additional legends from the United Kingdom: Kendo Nagasaki, Big Daddy, Mick McManus, and Giant Haystacks. Gameplay Within Career Mode, a wrestler will be working for a specific promoter in each area. By winning the belt for that division and successfully defending it, said promoter will become available for purchase in Shop Mode. Note that the world region is only available after completion of all the American territories. Each territory has between 8-12 storylines chosen at random with a push of a button. Certain storylines may not be available based on the wrestler used by the player. For example, if the player uses Jerry Lawler, the only storyline he can play in the Southeast region is based on the famous feud Lawler had with comedian Andy Kaufman. The game also features a Create A Legend mode (CAL). Players can create their own custom made characters which can be used for storyline mode as well as exhibition play.

It occupies offices year-round in the historic Baker Block Building, at 211 Taylor Street, Suite 401-A, 98368. (360) 379-1333. From the beginning the Festival has maintained a film library of Festival films, available to members. The Festival is juried each year by a team of film professionals. In 2016, and annually, PTFF will award \\"The Jim Ewing Young Director Award\\" in memory of Jim Ewing, one of the Festival's founders. In 2014 the Festival began its \\"Film Fellowship\\" program, offered to one film professional needing several months of rent-free housing to work on a project. In 2013 the Festival began offering annual Festival scholarships (two-night free lodging and festival passes) to film and journalism students. The Festival also, from the beginning, has partnered with local non-profits at no charge, to provide films that help support their missions. The largest annual fundraiser for PTFF is held in late February or early March, with live music, dinner, drinks, and a simulcast of the Oscars. =Founders= The Port Townsend Film Festival founders, Jim Ewing, Rocky Friedman, Jim Westall, and Linda Marie Yakush, were all veteran attendees of the Telluride Film Festival in Telluride, Colorado. That festival served as the model for the Port Townsend event. The PTFF founders also established an organizing committee consisting of Erik Andersson, Nancy Biery, Michael Harvey, Sherry Jones, Peter Simpson, and George Yakush. Future festival dates Focus: Women & Film, April 12‚Äì14, 2019; 20th Annual Film Festival Sept. 20-22, 2019.

History In 1957, Gene Autry's record label, Challenge Records, signed Dave Burgess (born 1934), a rockabilly singer-songwriter from California who often recorded under the name \\"Dave Dupree\\". At the end of 1957, having produced no hits, Challenge Records looked to Burgess, who organized a recording session on December 23 in Hollywood. In the studio that day were Burgess on rhythm guitar, Cliff Hills on bass, the Flores Trio (Danny Flores on saxophone and keyboards, Gene Alden on drums, and lead guitarist Buddy Bruce), and Huelyn Duvall contributing backing vocals. They gathered primarily to record \\"Train to Nowhere\\", a song by Burgess, as well as \\"Night Beat\\" and \\"All Night Rock\\" (a song that has never been released). The last tune recorded was \\"Tequila\\", essentially just a jam by the Flores Trio. It is based on a Cuban mambo beat. The word \\"Tequila\\" is spoken three times throughout the tune. There were three takes, and Danny Flores, who wrote the song, was also the man who spoke the word \\"Tequila!\\". Flores also played the trademark \\"dirty sax\\" solo. The song served as the B-side for \\"Train to Nowhere\\", which was released by Challenge Records on January 15, 1958. Duvall recalls that the record initially found little success, but, after a DJ in Cleveland played the B-side, \\"Tequila\\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart on March 28, 1958. Daniel Flores had written \\"Tequila\\", but, because he was signed to another label, the tune was credited to \\"Chuck Rio\\", a name he adopted for the stage. Those present for the December 23 session began recording together again on January 20, 1958, under the name the Champs; the group technically formed after recording \\"Tequila\\". The tune has been noted to have a similar rhythm structure to Bo Diddley's 1958 release \\"Dearest Darling\\". The Champs recorded a sequel to \\"Tequila\\" entitled \\"Too Much Tequila\\". Released as a maroon-label Challenge single, it reached No. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2020, group leader Dave Burgess resurrected The Champs and recorded 12 new tracks for an LP entitled \\"Tequila Party\\". The album contains a \\"party\\" version of \\"Tequila\\".

It refers to an ocean, sea or confluence.M.Mayrhofer EWA (1996) It also forms the name of Samudradeva, the Hindu god of the ocean. The word has been borrowed to various languages influenced by Sanskrit, including Modern Indo-Aryan languages and others.  Samudra in the Rigveda  The term occurs 133 times in the Rigveda, referring to oceans (real, mythical or figurative) or large bodies of water as well as to large Soma vessels, e.g. RV 6.69.6 (trans. Griffith): :Strengthened with sacred offerings, Indra-Visnu, first eaters, served with worship and oblation, :Fed with the holy oil, vouchsafe us riches; ye are the lake [samudra], the vat that holds the Soma. The precise semantic field of the Vedic word is difficult to establish, and has been much debated, in particular in relation to the question whether the bearers of the Rigvedic culture had direct knowledge of the ocean. Apart from the question of direct acquaintance of the bearers of Vedic culture with the ocean in the modern sense of the word, it is generally accepted that their worldview had the world encircled by oceans, a feature likely inherited from Proto-Indo-European mythology, with a \\"heavenly ocean\\" above the world, and a subterranean ocean of the underworld. Varuna was the deity presiding over both these oceans, and over water in general. From the literal meaning of the term, \\"Any mass of water more than one drop could be sam-udra: water in a jar, a small pool, a large lake, or the sea\\".* And indeed there are symbolic identifications of small quantities of water with mythical oceans, for example in the famous hymn to Varuna, emphasizing Varuna's omnipresence in every drop of water (AVS 4.16.3 cd) :'''' :\\"even the two oceans (samudrau) are the thighs of Varuna; even in this minute drop of water (udake) he is hidden\\". The oldest vedic commentators like the Brihaddevata of Shaunaka, Nighantu and the Nirukta of Yaska interpret the term Samudra as \\"ocean\\". The scholar G.V. Davane studied the occurrences of the term samudra in the Rigveda and concluded that the term means \\"terrestrial ocean\\".(Davane, G. V. 1982. An Analytical Study of ‚ÄòSamudra‚Äô in the Rigveda.) The Rigveda also speaks of a western and eastern Samudra (10.136.5-6). And in RV 7.6.7 there is an upper and a lower Samudra, where the upper Samudra seems to be a heavenly ocean. The Marutas \\"uplift from the ocean the rain, and fraught with vaporous moisture pour the torrents down\\" in RV 5.55.5. In RV 9.84.4 the moon (Soma) and the winds stir the Samudra. Additionally, RV 1.48.3 may indicate knowledge of the high tide.R. C. Majumdar and A. D. Pusalker (editors): The History and Culture of the Indian People. Volume I, The Vedic age. Bombay : Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan 1951, p.248 In RV 1.116.4 the Asvins rescued Bhujyu by carrying him for three days and three nights to the sea's farther shore. Thus Samudra seems to refer to the ocean in this verse. There are many other verses in the Rig Veda which refer to this tale (e.g. RV 1.118.6; VI 62, 6; VII 69, 7; VIII 5, 22), and where consequently Samudra could be identified with the ocean as well.(Kazanas 2002) = Samudra and rivers = Ocean god Samudra with personified rivers Samudra is usually translated as \\"ocean, sea\\" e.g. Griffith, MacDonnel, and Keith and the word itself means \\"gathering of waters\\". A minority of scholarse.g. Madhav Deshpande translate the term as \\"river\\". However, the Samudra is never said to flow in the Rigveda, but to receive all rivers.e.g. RV 6.36.3, 8.44.25 The Rigveda also describes the Vedic Sarasvati River as a river that flows to the oceane.g. RV 2.41.16-18 and \\"is pure in her course from the mountains to the sea\\".RV 7.95.2 Rigveda 1.71.7 describes the seven great rivers seeking the Samudra and in RV 7.33.8 it is written that all the rivers flow to the Samudra, but are unable to fill it. RV 7.49 says that the Samudra is the eldest of the waters (samudra jyestha), and that the goal of the rivers is the Samudra. According to Bhargava (1964) \\"samudra\\" stands for a huge inland lake, of which there were four or seven in Rigvedic sources. He translates sagara' as \\"ocean\\". In this view the \\"lowlands\\" of Kashmir and Kuruksetra were samudra, but the sea in which the Ganga fell is a sagara. Goddess Tirangini was Samudra's wife. Goddess Tirangini was goddess of Rivers. Goddess Lakshmi was Samudra's daughter. = Samudra and Vedic deities = The Vedic deity Varuna is the deity of the ocean (Samudra). The Vedic deity Indra also occurs frequently in connection with the Samudra. The Rigveda narrates that Indra slew the dragon which released the seven rivers and caused them to enter the ocean.(see Frawley 1991, 2001 for references to Rigvedic verses) Other gods that often occur together with the Samudra are Agni and Soma. = Samudra and ships = Some scholars like B.R. Sharma hold that the Rigvedic people may have been shipbuilders engaging in maritime trade.B.R. Sharma. 1967. Vedic Aryans and Sea-voyage In Rigveda 1.25.7; 7.88.3 and other instances, Samudra is mentioned together with ships. In RV 7.89.4 the rishi Vasishta is thirsting in the midst of water. Other verses mention oceanic waves (RV 4.58.1,11; 7.88.3). Some words that are used for ships are Nau, Peru, Dhi and Druma. A ship with a hundred oars is mentioned in RV 1.116. There were also ships with three masts or with ten oars.B.B. Lal in Trautmann, T. The Aryan debate in India, 2005:151 RV 9.33.6 says: 'From every side, O Soma, for our profit, pour thou forth four seas filled with a thousand-fold riches.\\" = Related terms = There are other Sanskrit terms in the Rigveda that appear to mean \\"ocean\\" or have similar meanings. Among them are the terms salila (ocean depths, unbounded sea), Arnas, Apas (water, sometimes celestial ocean), Purisha (heavenly ocean, clouds, origin of rain - the opposite of Samudra or terrestrial ocean). The waves are called Urmi in the Rigveda, and the lakes are called saras, kula, hrada or hlada. Another term, as mentioned above, is \\"sagara\\" (‡§∏‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞), which likewise is also found in modern Indo-Aryan languages and languages influenced by Sanskrit as an alternative for \\"samudra\\", some even having it more common to use than the latter term, including Balinese, Sundanese, and Javanese (in the form of \\"segara\\").  Satapatha Brahmana  In SB 1.6.3.11 there is (as also in the Rigveda) a reference to an eastern and western Samudra.

The color of the pictograms is different, varying from ochre, probably mixed up with blood, to lilac and brown, while the thickness is between 10 and 20 mm. The existence of the Ural characters was known long ago. Peter the Great in 1699 ordered the scrivener Yakov Losyov to go there and make an exact copy. The Ural pictograms span for about 800 km from north to south. The northernmost ones were found on the rivers Kolva and Vishera, while the southernmost ones were detected at Belaya River. The majority of Ural pictograms, however, were discovered along the Tagil River. Characteristics The Ural pictograms are tied to indigenous Ural population, the Finno-Ugric peoples. The pictograms were painted by finger or some tool from the ground level and artificial elevations, which allowed painting at the height of over three meters. Some pictogram lines are 4-5 cm thick. The images are generally aligned to the south. The Ural pictograms include the images of birds, animals, humans and various geometrical figures. The images of animals mainly depict moose, deer and roe deer. The birds are generally represented by waterfowl, mainly ducks and geese. Other images depict snakes and bear. Several pictograms of living beings feature skeleton pattern, showing the internal organs. In 2001 a carved image was found at the River Rezh, which disproved the long-standing opinion that all Ural pictograms are painted. Interpretations According to Russian researcher Valeriy Chernetsov, who published The Rock Images of Ural (1st volume in 1964, 2nd volume in 1971), the Ural pictograms generally depict the hunting utensil. The pictograms, however, as emphasized by Chernetsov, have no direct association with fishing as no images of fishes have been found on sites.

Origins of the name The word Janjira is not native to India, and may have originated after the Arabic word Jazeera, which means Island. Murud was once known in Marathi as Habsan (\\"of Habshi\\" or Abyssinian). The name of the fort is a concatenation of the Konkani and Arabic words for Island, \\"morod\\" and \\"jazeera\\". The word \\"morod\\" is peculiar to Konkani and is absent in Marathi.  Ramrao Patil of Janjira  Raja Ram Rao Patil was Patil of Janjira Island and a chief of Kolis who established and/or built this island in the 16th century for Kolis to live peacefully away from pirates. After gaining permission from the Sultan of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, he built the island but later refused to obey the orders of the Sultan. So the Sultan sent his Admiral Piram Khan to capture the janjira. Due to the castle's fortifications, Piram Khan was unable to attack the island conventionally, so he disguised himself as a merchant and requested to stay a night at janjira and permission was granted. Piram Khan hosted a party under the guise of thanking the patil. When the Patil and kolis were intoxicated, Piram Khan attacked them with his men who had been hidden in barrels and captured the island.  Major features  Fort Murud-Janjira paintings from the 17th century in the Mughal Kalak Bangadi, 3rd Largest Cannon in India At Janjira Fort, weighing over 22 Tons Murud-Janjira Fort is situated on an oval-shaped rock off the Arabian Sea coast near the port city of Murud, south of Mumbai. Janjira is considered one of the strongest marine forts in India. The fort is approached by sailboats from Rajapuri jetty. Janjira from the outside The main gate of the fort faces Rajapuri on the shore and can be seen only when one is about away from it. It has a small postern gate towards the open sea for escape. Entry Gate into Murud Janjira Fort. Accessible by ferry. The fort has 26 rounded bastions, still intact. There are many cannons of native and European make rusting on the bastions. Now in ruins, the fort in its heyday was a full-fledged living fort with all the necessary facilities, e.g., palaces, quarters for officers, mosque, two small natural fresh water lakes, etc.http://murudjanjira.blogspot.in/ On the outer wall flanking the main gate, there is a sculpture depicting a tiger-like beast clasping elephants in its claws. The sculpture on the main gate The palace of the Nawabs of Janjira at Murud is still in good shape. A special attraction of this fort are 3 gigantic cannons named Kalalbangdi, Chavri and Landa Kasam. These cannons were said to be feared for their shooting range. Another gate to the west is sea-facing, called 'Darya Darwaza'. There is also another fortress, named Ghosalgad, which is located on top of the hill around east of Murud-Janjira, that was used as outpost for the rulers of Janjira.  History  Inside the fort During its heyday, the island fort boasted 572 cannons. Visitors can gain access to the Janjira fort from Rajapuri, a small village on the coast. After a short ride in a small boat, one can enter the fort through the main entrance. The fort is oval shaped instead of the usual oblong or square shape. The fort wall is about 40 feet high and has 19 rounded porches or arches, some of which still have cannons mounted on them, including the famous cannon Kalaal Baangadi. These cannons were largely responsible for repelling oncoming enemies from the sea. Inside the fort walls are the ruins of a mosque, a palace and bath with water channeled from streams, evidence that royal ladies occupied the quarters. A deep well, still functional, provides fresh water despite the fort being surrounded by salt water. On shore is a luxurious cliff-top mansion, the Palace of the Nawab. Built by the former Nawab of Janjira, it commands a panoramic view of the Arabian sea and the Janjira sea fort. According to another record, the Abyssinian Sidis established the Janjira and Jafarabad state in early 1100. Archaeological Survey of India noticeboard at fort entrance According to accounts written by the Portuguese Admiral Fern√£o Mendes Pinto, the Ottoman fleet that first arrived in Aceh prior to the Ottoman expedition to Aceh led by Kurtoƒülu Hƒ±zƒ±r Reis included 200 Malabar sailors from Janjira to aid the region of Batak and Maritime Southeast Asia in 1539.Cambridge illustrated atlas, warfare: Renaissance to revolution, 1492‚Äì1792 by Jeremy Black. p.17 Later, in 1621, the Siddis of Janjira became exceptionally powerful as autonomous state to the point that the commander of Janjira, Siddi Ambar the Little, successfully defied his overlord Malik Ambar's attempt to replace him. Siddi Ambar the Little is accordingly considered the first Nawab of Janjira state. The island fortress was under control of Adil Shahi dynasty until the reign of Ibrahim II where Janjira fort was lost to the Siddis. Major historical figures from Murud-Janjira include men such as Sidi Hilal, Yahya Saleh and Sidi Yaqub. During the rule of Sultan Aurangzeb, Sidi Yaqut received a subsidy of 400,000 rupees. He also owned large ships which weighed 300‚Äì400 tons. According to the record these ships were unsuitable for fighting on the open sea against European warships, but their size allowed for transporting soldiers for amphibious operations. Despite their repeated attempts, the Portuguese, the British and the Marathas failed to subdue the power of the Siddis, who were themselves allied with the Mughal Empire. For example, 10,000 soldiers from Moro Pandit were repulsed by Janjira's army in 1676. The Marathas led by Shivaji attempted to scale the granite walls; he failed in all his attempts. His son Sambhaji even attempted to tunnel his way into the fort but was unsuccessful in all his attempts.India, Lonely Planet. He built another sea fort in 1676, known as Padmadurg or Kasa fort, to challenge Janjira. It is located northeast of Janjira. Padmadurg took 22 years to build and is constructed on 22 acres of land. Janjira ruins The small pond inside Janjira fort In the year 1736, Siddis of Murud-Janjira set out in a battle with the forces of Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao. On 19 April 1736, Maratha warrior Chimaji Appa attacked the gathering forces in the encampments of the Siddis near Rewas.Advance Study in the History of Modern India (Volume-1: 1707-1803) By G.S.Chhabra When the confrontation ended, 1,500 Siddis, including their leader Siddi Sat, were killed. Peace was concluded in September 1736, but the Siddis were confined to only Janjira, Gowalkot, and Anjanwel, thus their power greatly reduced. However, Janjira remained unconquered until it became part of Indian territory after independence from the British in 1947.

The file was made known to the public in 2003. During the War, German saboteurs operating against Britain designed a range of unconventional bomb disguises. According to Mi5, the German weapons were as ingenious as those invented by Britain's Special Operations Executive, which had been detailed in a series of files which had already been declassified in 1999. Disguises included tins of plums, throat lozenges, shaving brushes, batteries, wood, coal, stuffed dogs and, notably, a chocolate bar.MI5: 5 September 2005 releases: Cases of general interest Chocolate bar bomb Arguably the most unconventional bomb was the chocolate bar bomb that was intended to be smuggled into the Royal household with the purpose of assassination.Nazis' exploding chocolate plans - BBC News, Sunday 04 September 2005 None of the chocolate bars reached Britain, but British authorities did capture some in places as far away as Turkey. A secondary use for the proposed disguised chocolate bar was as an emergency hand grenade. The chocolate bar bomb was made of steel with a thin covering of real chocolate. When the piece of chocolate at the end was broken off, the canvas detonator was pulled, and, after a delay of seven seconds, the bomb would explode. To kill a member of the British royal family, the bar would have had to be smuggled into the residence by the saboteurs themselves or smuggled into a box that would have been taken into Buckingham Palace from an ordinary source. None of the saboteurs got close enough to London to carry out the Nazi plan. These ingenious objects got no further than four explosive cans of peas, which were found on German agents who landed in Ireland by small boat; the agents claimed that they hoped to get them into the Palace. Why any member of the Royal Family would be opening a tin of peas themselves, however, doesn't seem to have been taken into account.World Briefing / Europe: Britain: Peas Plot - The New York Times, Saturday 15 November 2003 See also *Exploding cigar References Category:United Kingdom home front during World War II Category:Bombs ","title":"Camouflages for sabotage equipment used by the German sabotage services in World War II"},{"id":"2739637","text":"Colletto Fava is a hill near the village and ski-station of Artesina in the commune of Frabosa Sottana in the northern Piedmont region of Italy.

As in Germany, former Soviet countries have an additional doctoral degree, Doktor nauk (, literally \\"Doctor of Sciences\\"), which by official agreement is equivalent to habilitation and typically requires 10 years of original research after Kandidat nauk is attained. Overview The degree was first introduced in the USSR on 13 January 1934 by a decision of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR, all previous degrees, ranks and titles having been abolished immediately after the October Revolution in 1917. Academic distinctions and ranks were viewed as survivals of capitalist inequality and hence were to be permanently eliminated. The original decree also recognized some degrees earned prior to 1917 in Tsarist Russia and elsewhere. To attain the Candidate of Sciences degree, an individual must hold a Master's (Magistr) or a Specialist diploma, both one or (more typically) two year degrees in this system. Both of these prerequisites are post-bachelors (Bakalavr) degrees, bachelor's being four years of full-time study. The Candidate of Sciences degree requires a minimum of three years of full-time study during which the individual must conduct and publish advanced original research into a topic that is deemed significant or has practical economic or military potential. In order to attain the rank of full Professor in these countries, a Doctor of Sciences degree is required in the same way that habilitation is required in Germany. This is also sometimes the case in the United States and the United Kingdom, where in addition to the possession of a doctoral degree, some volume of further research must be demonstrated. Procedure for attaining the degree The work on a dissertation is commonly carried out during a postgraduate study period called aspirantura. It is performed either within an educational institution (such as a university) or a scientific research institution (such as an institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences network). It can also be carried out without a direct connection to the academy. In exceptional cases, the Candidate of Sciences degree may be awarded on the basis of published scholarly works without writing a thesis. In experimental sciences the dissertation is based on an independent research project conducted under the supervision of a professor, the results of which must be published in at least three papers in peer-review scientific journals. A necessary prerequisite is taking courses in philosophy and foreign language, and passing a qualifying examination called \\"candidate minimum\\". In the Soviet Union, the candidate minimum included exams in the specialty field of the \\"dissertant\\", in a foreign language of his/her choice and in scientific communism. In post-Soviet Russia and other post- Soviet states, the latter examination was replaced by the one in philosophy, and in Russia recently in the history and philosophy of science; in Ukraine it is still philosophy. The dissertation is presented (defended) at the accredited educational or scientific institutions before a committee called the Scientific Council. The Council consists of about 20 members, who are the leading specialists (including the academicians) in the field of the dissertation and who have been selected and approved to serve on the Council. The summary of the dissertation must be published before public defense in the form of \\"autoreferat\\" in about 150‚Äì200 copies, and distributed to major research organizations and libraries. The seeker of the degree must have an official \\"research supervisor\\". The dissertation must be delivered together with official references of several reviewers, called \\"opponents\\". In a procedure called the \\"defense of the dissertation\\" the dissertation is summarized before the Commission, followed by speeches by the opponents or the reading of their references, and replies to the comments of the opponents and question of the Commission members by the aspirant. If the defense is successful (66.6% majority of votes by the secret ballot voting by the members of the Council), it is recommended and later must be approved by the central statewide board called Higher Attestation Commission or \\"Vysshaya attestacionnaya komissiya\\" or VAK (or by similar authority in other applicable countries). Local characteristicsFormer Czechoslovakia= In Czechoslovakia, the Candidate and Doctor of Sciences (, ) degrees were modeled precisely after the Soviet one by Law 60/1953 in 1953. Requirements to attain the degree were thus literally the same as in the USSR. Since all Czechoslovak top academic research institutions were dissolved after the Communist Putsch in 1948, the supreme academic authority was represented by the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, newly established in 1953. The degree could also be awarded by the Slovak Academy of Sciences and universities. The abbreviation of the degree is CSc. (), added behind the bearer's name and a comma. There also have been other academic degrees in Czechoslovakia and its successional states, that incorporate the \\"Dr.\\" abbreviation, e.g. * JUDr. (, , , ) * PhDr. (, , , ) * RNDr. (, , , ) and others. These doctor degrees are not to be confused with a Ph.D., although its holders are addressed \\"doctor\\". Applicants need a master's degree (5 years +) or a comparable degree with excellent grades. This degree is stated before names and awarded after writing a rigorous thesis of 50.000 to 80.000 words and defending it at a viva voce and (rigorous) exam in at least 2-3 related fields of doctoral studies. * MUDr. () is a \\"Doctor of Medicine\\" degree equivalent to the North-American MD, attained after 6-year university studies. * MVDr. () is a \\"Doctor of Veterinary\\" akin to DVM. * RSDr. () was a quasi-degree, awarded exclusively to functionaries of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSƒå) during the Communist era, who either or not \\"graduated\\" from the Political College of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The leading subject taught was Marxism-Leninism and there was no need to have completed even a secondary school to attain the degree. RSDr. was also possible to attain at some military universities, however, contrary to the previous case, the applicant had to pass further exams. Czech Republic Granting CSc. was abolished in 1998 and replaced with Ph.D. or Th.D. () An applicant is required to have master's degree (or its equivalent, e.g. Engineer (Ing.) in technical and economic university programs or Doctor of Medicine (MUDr.), Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (MVDr.) in medical university programs), enroll in an approximately three-year post-graduate program and defend their dissertation before a panel of expert examiners appointed by the university. Slovakia Candidate was abolished in 1996 and replaced with PhD. (, in 1996-2002 officially in Latin: philosophiae doctor). Requirements are similar to the Czech system. =Poland= Since the medieval period, Polish tradition was to call Ph.D. equivalent as \\"doktor\\". Only for a short period of time between 1951-1958 the communist government tried to replace the title of \\"doktor\\" with \\"kandydat nauk\\" to follow the Soviet model. =Former Soviet Union, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus= Sample contents of modern Candidate of Sciences diploma (here, Candidate of Engineering Sciences), 1999 In the USSR, there was required at least three original scientific papers published and/or submitted. At least one paper should be in one of the journals listed by the Higher Assessment Commission (VAK) of the Russian Ministry of Science. In Belarus and Ukraine now, all the three publications have to be published in the journals listed by the VAK. In 1971, there were 249,200 scientists holding the Candidate degree. According to \\"Guidelines for the recognition of Russian qualifications in the other countries\\", in countries with a two-tier system of doctoral degrees, the degree of Candidate of Sciences should be considered for recognition at the level of the first doctoral degree. In countries with only one doctoral degree, the degree of Candidate of Sciences should be considered for recognition as equivalent to this degree. Branches of science Depending on the specialty of research in the dissertation, a candidate is awarded one of the following degrees: * agricultural sciences (abbr.: –∫. —Å.-—Ö. –Ω.); * architecture (abbr.: –∫. –∞—Ä—Ö.); * art criticism (abbr.: –∫. –∏—Å–∫.); * biological sciences (abbr.: –∫. –±. –Ω.); * chemical sciences (abbr.: –∫. —Ö. –Ω.); * culturology (abbr.: –∫. –∫—É–ª—å—Ç.); * economic sciences (abbr.: –∫. —ç. –Ω.); * engineering sciences (abbr.: –∫. —Ç. –Ω.); * geographic sciences (abbr.: –∫. –≥–µ–æ–≥—Ä. –Ω.); * geologo-mineralogical sciences (abbr.: –∫. –≥.-–º. –Ω.); * historical sciences (abbr.: –∫. –∏—Å—Ç. –Ω.); * juridical sciences (abbr.: –∫. —é. –Ω.); * medical sciences (abbr.: –∫. –º. –Ω.); * military sciences (abbr.: –∫. –≤–æ–µ–Ω. –Ω.); * pedagogic sciences (abbr.: –∫. –ø–µ–¥. –Ω.); * pharmaceutical sciences (abbr.: –∫. —Ñ–∞—Ä–º. –Ω.); * philological sciences (abbr.: –∫. —Ñ–∏–ª–æ–ª. –Ω.); * philosophical sciences (abbr.: –∫. —Ñ–∏–ª–æ—Å. –Ω.); * physico-mathematical sciences (abbr.: –∫. —Ñ.-–º. –Ω.); * political sciences (abbr.: –∫. –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç. –Ω.); * psychological sciences (abbr.: –∫. –ø—Å. –Ω.); * sociological sciences (abbr.: –∫. —Å–æ—Ü. –Ω.); * theology (abbr.: –∫. –±–æ–≥–æ—Å–ª.); * veterinary sciences (abbr.: –∫. –≤–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞—Ä. –Ω.). Previously, there was also the degree of \\"naval sciences\\" (abbr.: –∫. –≤–æ–µ–Ω.-–º–æ—Ä. –Ω.). For some time (in the 1940s) there was also the degree of \\"candidate of art criticism sciences\\" (abbr.: –∫. –∏—Å–∫. –Ω.). Some specialties permit the award of the candidate degree for several variants of branches of science, depending on the dominant subject area of the dissertation; e. g., specialty 02.00.04 (physical chemistry) can be awarded the degree of candidate of physico-mathematical, technical, or chemical sciences. However, for each dissertation only one branch of science can be chosen.

This self-assembling nanocomposite is flexible and durable to high and low pressures, temperatures, tensions, most chemical reactions, and retains all of its physical and chemical properties upon being returned to a ground state. NanoSonic‚Äôs Metal Rubber‚Ñ¢ is an electrically conductive and flexible elastomer. It can be mechanically strained to greater than 1000 percent of its original dimensions while remaining electrically conductive. As Metal Rubber can carry data and electrical power and is environmentally rugged, it has use as a flexible and stretchable electrical conductors in the aerospace/defense, electronics and bioengineering markets. Properties Metal rubber only needs to contain around one percent metal ions to maintain its conductive properties, allowing the material to retain the elastic quality as well as keeping the costly metal component low. Metal rubber has a strain of 300% although the sheet itself can be mechanically strained to greater than 1000% its original dimensions. The elastic modulus is 0.01 GPa and the service resistivity per square sheet is .1‚Äì100 ohms. The maximum service temperature 170 degrees Celsius (338 degrees Fahrenheit), while the minimum service temperature is ‚Äì60 degrees Celsius (‚Äì76 degrees Fahrenheit). It carries an electrical charge that can be used to transport power and data. It is typical of an elastomer to be an insulator but metal rubber is highly conductive like metals.  Applications  Metal Rubber is made through a modified molecular- level self-assembly production process using precursors NanoSonic produces in- house. Materials are manufactured in a variety of sizes and geometries. The possible uses of such a product include superior body armor, durable electronic sensors, various aerospace-building materials, and alternate commercial building materials. Several industries have unique needs that are met by metal rubber's characteristics. 1\\\\. Aerospace/Defense :Very robust under harsh conditions (High and low temperature/pressure). 2\\\\. Electronics :Stretchable electrical conductors/sensors. 3\\\\. Bioengineering Markets :Very flexible but absolutely no corrosion. Very useful for joint replacement instead of heavy metal implants. :The thicker dimensions of the metal rubber can be used for artificial muscles because of the flexibility and conductive properties for bio-electrical signals. Current products NanoSonic currently offers a variety of products that incorporates metal rubbers unique properties. 1\\\\. Metal Rubber Cables :This product can be used to replace heavy metal power and data cables as well as make conductive fabrics and CNTs. Also used in improved lightweight EMI shielding and can be used as an elastomer cover for hoses and tubing. 2\\\\. Metal Rubber Shielding :Based on nanostructured metal rubber and carbon nanotubes, it is lightweight, environmentally durable and allows radios wave frequency selection and broadband connection. 3\\\\.

The film explores a wave of seemingly unconnected suicides that strikes Japan and the efforts of the police to determine the reasons behind the strange behavior. Suicide Club gained a considerable amount of notoriety in film festivals around the world for its controversial, transgressive subject matter and overall gruesome presentation. It developed a significant cult following over the years, and won the Jury Prize for \\"Most Ground-Breaking Film\\" at the 2003 Fantasia Film Festival. Plot The film takes place over six days, with footage from a fictional pop group \\"Dessert\\" opening and closing the film. In Tokyo on May 27, 54 teenage schoolgirls commit mass suicide by throwing themselves in front of an oncoming train. Shortly after, at a hospital, two nurses commit suicide by jumping out of a window. At both locations, rolls of skin are found, with the skin in the rolls matching that removed from the bodies of the dead. Three detectives--Kuroda (Ry≈ç Ishibashi), Shibusawa (Masatoshi Nagase), and Murata (Akaji Maro)--are notified by a hacker named Kiyoko (Yoko Kamon) of a link between the suicides and a website that shows the number of suicides as red and white circles. On May 28, at a high school, a group of students jump off the roof during lunch, sending the city in search of a \\"Suicide Club\\". By May 29, the suicide boom has spread all over Japan. Mitsuko is on her way home when she gets hit by her boyfriend, Masa, who has thrown himself off a roof. Mitsuko is taken to the police station for questioning, where the police strip-search her and discover that she has a butterfly tattoo. On May 30, the police receive a call from a boy who warns that on that evening at 7:30, another mass suicide will take place at the same platform. The detectives organize a stake-out in order to prevent the event but there is no suicide. Meanwhile, individual and smaller-scale group suicides continue all over Japan, claiming many lives, including Kuroda's entire family. Kuroda receives a call from the boy who had warned about the 7:30 suicide, and Kuroda shoots himself after. Kiyoko is captured by a group led by a man named Genesis, whose hideout is a small subterranean bowling alley, where he resides with four glam-rock rock cohorts. During her capture, Genesis performs a song while a girl in a white sack is brutally raped and killed right in front of them. Kiyoko e-mails the authorities information about Genesis. On May 31, the police arrest Genesis, and it is assumed the leader of the \\"Suicide Club\\" has been caught. On June 1, Mitsuko goes to her boyfriend's home to return his helmet, where she notices pop group Dessert's posters on the wall and recognizes a pattern on the fingers of the group that corresponds to the letters on a telephone keypad spelling out the word \\"suicide\\". The boy from earlier calls to tell her there is no \\"Suicide Club\\" and invites her to a secret concert. On June 2, Mitsuko sneaks into the backstage area and sees a group of children in the audience, who ask her questions. Mitsuko impresses the children so they take her to a room where a strip from her skin is shaved off; it is the spot where the butterfly tattoo was. A new roll of skin ends up with the police, and detective Shibusawa recognizes the strip as the one with Mitsuko's tattoo. That evening, he sees Mitsuko at the train station and grabs her hand but she pulls away. She stares at Shibusawa as the train pulls into the station, and again after boarding the train. As the train pulls out, the ending credits begins, in which Dessert announces their disbandment and offer appreciation toward their fans' support, before performing their final song.

Jonathan Regehr of Screen Anarchy gave the film a rating of 6/10, calling it \\"an unbalanced movie\\". Dai Green of HorrorNews.net wrote that the film \\"may not register entirely in first run, but it will certainly leave a mark\\". Virginie S√©lavy of Electric Sheep Magazine wrote that \\"Suicide Club has been described as 'muddled' and Sono criticised for not making his satire of pop culture and denunciation of the media clear enough. But the ambiguity of the film is precisely what makes it interesting\\". Prequel As of early 2006, the film has one prequel and a proposed follow-up. Noriko's Dinner Table (Noriko no Shokutaku) depicts events from before and after the happenings of Suicide Circle and gives more insight on several plotholes of its predecessor. In 2006, Sono said \\"I always wanted to make a trilogy but in reality it is very difficult.\\"Offscreen: An Interview with Sion Sono Print publicationsNovel= Jisatsu Saakuru: Kanzenban (Ëá™ÊÆ∫„Çµ„Éº„ÇØ„É´ ÂÆåÂÖ®Áâà, translated as Suicide Circle: The Complete Edition) was written by Sion Sono in April 2002. The book deals with the themes of Suicide Club and Noriko's Dinner Table, bringing the two plots closer. So far no plans for an English edition have appeared. =Manga= A manga of the same title and written by Usamaru Furuya appeared at the same time of the movie's Japanese DVD release. Although Furuya's intention was to faithfully reproduce the film's plot, Sono asked him to write his own story. As a result, the Suicide Club manga is much more straightforward and easier to understand than the film, and features much more solid character development. It deals with the same opening scene, but there is a twist: out of the 54 suicidal girls, a survivor is reported: Saya Kota. Her best friend, Kyoko, must now unveil the secret of the Suicide Club and save Saya from falling deeper into it.

Early life A native and lifelong resident of Walpole, Massachusetts, Morgan graduated from Walpole High School and attended Boston College, where he played varsity hockey‚Äîhe was a high scoring center who led the Eagles in points as a junior‚Äîas well as baseball. Morgan was also elected as team captain for Boston College's baseball team during his junior year. He signed his first professional baseball contract on June 20, 1952, with his then-hometown National League team, the Boston Braves. Playing career Morgan stood tall and weighed during his active career. When he finally made Major League Baseball at age 28 in , after military service and a long stint in the minor leagues, his parent team had become the Milwaukee Braves. A left-handed- hitting second baseman, third baseman and outfielder, Morgan put up several strong seasons at the Double-A and Triple-A levels, and batted over the .300 mark three times. But he could not crack the Braves' lineup, nor those of the Philadelphia Phillies, Kansas City Athletics, Cleveland Indians and St. Louis Cardinals. In parts of four Major League seasons, he appeared in just 88 games, collected 36 hits, and batted only .193. His two MLB home runs came during his stint with the 1960 Indians within a two-week period, as he hit solo blasts off Chuck Estrada August 30 and Ted Sadowski on September 10.1960 regular season batting log from Retrosheet In the latter contest, Morgan's three hits and two runs scored powered the Indians to a 5‚Äì4 victory over the Washington Senators.1960-09-10 box score from Retrosheet In 13 seasons in the minor leagues, Morgan racked up 1,353 hits (with 117 home runs) and compiled a lifetime batting mark of .278. He was named Most Valuable Player of the Triple-A International League in 1964 after batting .290 with 16 home runs for the Jacksonville Suns. Managerial careerPittsburgh Pirates' organization= In 1966, Morgan became a manager in the farm system of the Pittsburgh Pirates, rising in 1970 to Triple-A with the Columbus Jets of the International League. In 1971, he moved with the Jets to Charleston, West Virginia, and became skipper of the Charleston Charlies. Morgan was called to the Major Leagues to serve as a Pittsburgh coach under Bill Virdon in , when the Pirates won the National League East Division title but fell in the 1972 NLCS to the Cincinnati Reds. Morgan then returned to the minors as the Pirates' Triple-A manager. In 1973, his Charlies won 85 games and the division title, but lost in the International League playoffs to the Pawtucket Red Sox in five games. Nevertheless, Morgan was selected Minor League Manager of the Year for 1973 by The Sporting News. =Pawtucket Red Sox= Morgan switched to Pawtucket, and joined the Boston Red Sox organization, the following season. He led the PawSox‚Äîlocated 24 miles (38 km) from his Walpole hometown‚Äîfor nine years (1974‚Äì82), the longest-tenured manager in the franchise's history. Morgan won 601 games, losing 658 (.477) and was the Pawtucket skipper during its famous 33-inning game against Rochester in , though he was ejected in the 22nd. He won the International League Manager of the Year award in 1977. =Boston Red Sox= The parent Red Sox reassigned Morgan after the 1982 season, making him a scout for 1983‚Äì84 before he was finally invited to return to the Majors as Boston's first-base coach in . He worked as the team's bullpen coach during the Red Sox' pennant-winning season, then replaced Rene Lachemann as Boston's third-base coach in . In , a talented Boston team was stumbling at one game over .500 under manager John McNamara, leading the ownership to fire him during the All-Star break. They named Morgan acting manager July 14 and began negotiations with high-profile candidates, such as Joe Torre and Lou Piniella, who were under contract to other organizations. The Red Sox promptly won their first 12 games under Morgan‚Äîa period dubbed by the press as Morgan Magic‚Äîand the team named him as their permanent field boss. The 1988 Red Sox won the AL East, but were swept by the Oakland Athletics in the American League Championship Series; two years later, the 1990 Sox repeated history, winning their division but bowing in four straight to the A's in the playoffs. Morgan holds the record for managing a team to eight straight post-season losses. In , Morgan guided a flawed Boston team to a distant second-place finish in the AL East. Although he had one year remaining on his contract, he was fired at season's end in favor of Butch Hobson. \\"This team just isn't that good\\", Morgan warned in his parting comments. He was right; under Hobson, the 1992 Red Sox finished last in the AL East. Morgan's final big league managerial totals: 301‚Äì262 (.535) over 3¬Ω years, all with the Red Sox. His record as a minor league manager over 16 seasons (1966‚Äì71; 1973‚Äì82) was 1,140 victories and 1,102 defeats (.508) with one league championship (with the York Pirates of the Double-A Eastern League in 1969). Popularity Despite the playoff setbacks, Morgan was a highly popular figure in and around the Boston area as a \\"native son\\", a former hockey player and blue-collar hero. He was called \\"Walpole Joe,\\" as well as \\"Turnpike Joe\\" in tribute to the offseason job he held for many years to supplement his minor league pay: driving a snowplow on the Massachusetts Turnpike. (The nicknames also served to prevent confusion with Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan.) His phrases became part of New England folklore, such as \\"Roger spun another beauty\\" (describing one of many stellar outings by his star pitcher, Roger Clemens), \\"I manage this nine!\\" (asserting himself to a disgruntled Jim Rice) and \\"Six, two and even\\" (a catch phrase from the old Dick Tracy radio show) . In 2006, he was named to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame and the Walpole High School Hockey Hall of Fame. Morgan was inducted into the International League Hall of Fame in 2008. On July 30, 2013, the Red Sox honored him with \\"Joe Morgan Night\\" at Fenway Park, with Clemens among the former players participating in the festivities.Boston Red Sox official web site ReferencesExternal links , or Retrosheet Category:1930 births Category:Living people Category:Atlanta Crackers players Category:Baseball coaches from Massachusetts Category:Baseball players from Massachusetts Category:Boston College Eagles baseball players Category:Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey players Category:Boston Red Sox coaches Category:Boston Red Sox managers Category:Boston Red Sox scouts Category:Charleston Marlins players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Evansville Braves players Category:Hartford Chiefs players Category:International League MVP award winners Category:Jacksonville Braves players Category:Jacksonville Suns players Category:Kansas City Athletics players Category:Louisville Colonels (minor league) players Category:Major League Baseball bullpen coaches Category:Major League Baseball first base coaches Category:Major League Baseball third base coaches Category:Major League Baseball third basemen Category:Milwaukee Braves players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Pawtucket Red Sox managers Category:People from Walpole, Massachusetts Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates coaches Category:Raleigh Pirates players Category:Rapi√±os de Occidente players Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:San Juan Marlins players Category:Wichita Braves players ","title":"Joe Morgan (manager)"},{"id":"2739734","text":"Purolator 500 may refer to two different NASCAR races: * Purolator 500 (Pocono), the race at Pocono Raceway from 1974 to 1976 (now Gander Outdoors 400) * Purolator 500 (Atlanta), the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway from 1994 to 1996 (now Kobalt Tools 500) ","title":"Purolator 500"},{"id":"2739741","title":"Andrew Francis"},{"id":"2739742","text":"UCN may stand for: *Ultracold Neutrons *Universal Character Name, as in the ISO 8859 standard, Unicode, C99, or C++. *Universidad Cat√≥lica del Norte, a university in Antofagasta, Chile *University College of the North, a university college in Manitoba, Canada *Central University of Nicaragua, a private and nonprofit university, Nicaragua *University College of Northern Denmark, a university in Denmark *Urocortin, a human gene *UCN, the IATA Airport Code for Buchanan Airport *Ultimate Custom Night, the video game ","title":"UCN"},{"id":"2739744","text":"Coca-Cola 500 may refer to the following NASCAR races: * Coca-Cola 500 (Pocono) (1977‚Äì1980), race held at Pocono Raceway, now named the Pocono 350 * Coca-Cola 500 (Atlanta) (1981‚Äì1985), race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, now named the Kobalt Tools 500 * Coca-Cola 500 (Motegi), a 1998 exhibition NASCAR stock car race held in Japan See also * Coca-Cola 600, the current NASCAR race held at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina on Memorial Day ","title":"Coca-Cola 500"},{"id":"2739756","text":"Glashan Middle School is an Ottawa, Ontario junior high school teaching grade seven and grade eight. It is located in the Centretown neighbourhood between Kent Street and Bank Street. It was founded as an elementary school for the small community of Orangeville, to the south of Ottawa. It was known as Hugh Street School, as Kent Street was then named Hugh Street. In 1889 the town was amalgamated with Ottawa, and its one room school house became part of the Ottawa school board, as this part of the city was rapidly growing in 1889, the one-room one-teacher school was overcrowded with a total of 99 students. Thus, in 1897, four new rooms were added, and in 1905 another four. The school was soon renamed Glashan PS, after the Chief Inspector of Ottawa Public Schools from 1876 to 1910, J.C. Glashan. The school was expanded again in 1922 and once more 1931, when it became one amongst a group of Ottawa schools to switch to the pioneering intermediate school format, the school officially became Glashan MS, and has remained a junior high school ever since. In 1979-1980 the old school was demolished and the current one erected. This was one of only a few Ottawa Board of Education projects in that era of shrinking demographics. The school today offers a number of programs. It is home to gifted, core French, late French immersion, and English language learning and teaching programs. It is also well known for its excellent volleyball teams. One disadvantage of the school's downtown location is that there is no room for a playing field attached to the school, and students are forced to walk two blocks to a field south of the Queensway. The school has an unofficial student run subreddit at /r/glashan.https://www.reddit.com/r/glashan/ Sports at Glashan Mr. Rick Desclouds was the coach of the Glashan Boys Spikers, Glashan's AA team, but retired at the end of the 2009-2010 school year. Desclouds has worked in Glashan for 37 years. In 2005, Glashan lost two of its best volleyball players due to a deadly fire, Danny and Gary Thach. The boys volleyball team has won the provincial championships 19 times, including in 2006 and 2007. In 2011, both the girls' and the boys' teams won the provincial championships in Toronto. In 2013, The boys' Glashan Spikers won the Provincial Championship title again, with the assistant coaching of Rick Desclouds. Glashan hosts two volleyball tournaments, one in November and another in January: the November tournament is a friendship tournament; the one in January is a very competitive one, sometimes with as many as 30 teams from all around the Eastern Ontario region participating. Glashan participates, and is successful, in many other sports, including Touch football (In the school year of 2010-2011 the Glashan girls finished first at the regional tournament and went on to take gold at the board wide tournament as well), Track and field, and Badminton. Glashan also has an ice hockey team. Other extracurricular activities of note View from Catherine Street Glashan has a very successful competitive math team. Two teams coached by Miss Sarah Roberts finished 1st and 2nd in the regional Math Olympics competition in April 2008, defeating many other strong teams from local schools, such as Bridlewood and Greenbank. Both teams qualified for the provincial event in May. The team that finished first in the regional competition finished 6th in the provincials, and the Glashan team who took regional second won provincial first, Glashan's first ever first place at this competition level. On April 25, 2009, Glashan's Math Olympics team took first place again, for the second year in a row. The team won all four team events, the first time this has happened in the history of the competition. The other team for this year, however, did not do as well and did not qualify for the provincial event. In 2010 and 2011 the team from Glashan won the regional competition again, and, in 2011, the two teams sent from Glashan won first and second place once more. The first place team went on to the provincial competition, and did well. Glashan also has a variety of different clubs, including the Free the Children club and a chess club, and also has a student council. For student council, there is one male and one female representative from each class, who attend meetings and help make decisions on behalf of the student body. The student council is also in charge of the dances, such as an annual Halloween dance, and many fundraisers. References *Cummings, H.R. and W.T. MacSkimming.

It is part of the civil parish of Broomhaugh and Riding. It is served by Riding Mill railway station and by a frequent bus service on the route from Hexham to Newcastle. Riding Mill is notable as the location of Riding Mill pumping station. Up until here the water released from Kielder Water uses the River Tyne but at Riding Mill it is pumped to parts of Tyne and Wear and over the hills to Teesside. Leaving the village towards Hexham, Hollin Hill Terrace is situated on the left. Very little information is available on these eight dwellings but they are an example of Victorian architecture. This terrace was not shown on maps of the area prior to 1850, but appear on a map dated between 1850/1894. History Mackenzie (1825) wrote -- The Riding Mill is built upon a mountain brook called Dipton Burn ‚Äì which it was often hazardous to pass, but in 1822 a good bridge was built across it. It is in length and in breadth. In recent times the road from the south coming into Riding Mill was a notorious traffic hazard because of the steep slope and the bends. A safety pit of small stones was constructed to halt vehicles that got out of control. The hill was also difficult to climb the other way, but a new road bypasses Riding Mill. =Styford= Directly north across the River Tyne is Styford Hall, the chief residence of the former township of Styford in Bywell St Andrew parish. Governance Riding Mill is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham, Guy Opperman of the Conservative Party is the Member of Parliament. Prior to Brexit, for the European Parliament its residents voted to elect MEP's for the North East England constituency. For Local Government purposes it belongs to Northumberland County Council a unitary authority. Landmarks The corn mill existed in medi√¶val times and was granted to the monastery at Blanchland. It was a good source of profit because all the tenants had to bring their corn to be ground here and hand mills were forbidden by law. Since crossing the burn was difficult a pack horse bridge was constructed 1599-1600. In recent times the mill has been converted into a residence, but its appearance has been kept. The water wheel was of the overshot type and a dam above the mill retained the water for its use. The large house opposite became the Wellington Hotel. It is a handsome structure and carries the date 1660 above the door. The letters are considered to be the initials of Thomas Errington and his wife Ann Carnaby. T.B. has come about by the Boultflour family living here; they were millers and probably altered the E into a B. The house gained some notoriety by its association with witchcraft. Anne Armstrong, the witch finder, lived at Birchesnook. In 1673 she accused Anne, wife of Thomas Baites of Morpeth, a tanner, of frequenting witches' meetings at Riding Bridge-end, where she danced with the devil. She also claimed to have seen Anne Forster of Stocksfield, Anne Dryden of Prudhoe and Lucy Thompson of Mickley, supping with theire proctector which they called their god in the Riding house. But the charges were dismissed at the Morpeth Quarter Sessions, the magistrates not being impressed with the evidence. Other significant buildings include Oaklands Manor, Wentworth Grange, Underwood Hall, and former vicarage The Glebe.

Buddy plays in-front of Currie's desk in 1998. Betty Currie (born Betty Grace Williams; November 10, 1939) is the former personal secretary for Bill Clinton (during his tenure as President of the United States). She became well known as a figure in the Lewinsky scandal for her alleged handling of gifts given to Monica Lewinsky by President Clinton.  Life and career  Currie was born in Edwards, Mississippi and moved to Waukegan, Illinois as a child. After leaving high school, she worked in the clerical field at the Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois. She later moved to Washington, DC and worked at the Navy Department, the Postal Service, US Agency for International Development, the Peace Corps, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Currie's rise in the government bureaucracy began when Joseph Blatchford became Peace Corps Director in 1969 and needed a new secretary. \\"The job was a crucial one. It had 10,000 people spread out over 68 countries, and I needed a reliable, efficient person,\\" he says. \\"I didn't ask if she was a Republican or Democrat. I wasn't interested because she was so good.\\" Currie stayed with Blatchford when he moved to ACTION, the federal agency that ran the Peace Corps, and she stayed there through three directors, Blatchford, Balzano, and Brown, building her own network among the people who sit just outside the big corner offices. Her association with the Peace Corps has continued with her appointment to the Board of Directors of the National Peace Corps Association in 2006.http://www.rpcv.org/pages/sitepage.cfm?id=104 After initially retiring from government service, she met John Podesta who encouraged her to return in 1984 to run offices for the Mondale and then again for the 1988 Dukakis Presidential campaigns and later join the Clinton campaign where she worked with James Carville in the famous \\"War Room\\" in Little Rock, Arkansas. After Clinton's election to the presidency, Currie served as his personal secretary during both of his terms. She still keeps in touch with the Clinton family, and donated $750 to Mrs. Clinton's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008.  Lewinsky scandal  Currie testified in front of the grand jury responsible for the perjury investigation in relation to Clinton's statement in the Paula Jones case. Currie testified on January 28, May 7 and May 14, 1998. Lewinsky had testified that Currie had arranged a meeting at Lewinsky's apartment to pick up gifts given to her by Clinton, showed up at her Watergate apartment and said, \\"I believe you have something for me.\\" Currie denied this charge and claimed that Lewinsky had arranged the meeting. Regardless of who instigated the meeting, Currie took the gifts in question home and stored them under her bed. The gifts included, among other things, a hat pin, two brooches, a blanket, a marble bear figurine, T-shirt from Martha's Vineyard, and Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass; the poetry book was of interest as Bill had given a copy to Hillary also. Lewinsky gave Clinton about 30 gifts. The gifts were picked up after Jones' lawyers had subpoenaed them. It was also revealed that Currie had asked Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan to help Lewinsky find a job in New York on December 8, 1997. Currie also testified that Clinton had recently called her in to work on a Sunday, on January 18, 1998, and pointedly said to her, regarding Lewinsky and himself, \\"We were never alone, right?\\" among other leading questions. This, added to similar incidents involving other potential witnesses, led to Clinton's subsequent impeachment charge of obstruction of justice. Currie was not one of the four witnesses who gave video depositions during the Senate trial. During the scandal, it was also reported by The Washington Post' that Currie was receiving spiritual counseling from Jesse Jackson. Post-Clinton years Currie has retired and lives in St. Mary's County, Maryland with her husband. She has a grown daughter. Socks, Chelsea Clinton's White House cat, lived with her from the time she left the White House until Socks was euthanized after a long battle with cancer in February 2009. She was appointed to the Alcohol Beverage Board of St. Mary's County Maryland, serving at her first meeting on Thursday April 10, 2008. In December 2008 Currie once again returned to Washington, answering phones for the co-chairman of President-elect Barack Obama's transition, John Podesta. She did not return to the White House after President Obama's inauguration.

Although he inherited a large fortune, he died almost penniless from funding a chronic and persistent drug addiction. John was the eldest child of Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol. He was distant from his father, who treated him harshly, and did not get on well with him, though he was close to his first stepmother, Lady Juliet. After spending time in London, Monte Carlo, Paris and New York in the 1970s, he settled in part of the family seat, Ickworth House in Suffolk, becoming the 7th Marquess in 1985. Despite inheriting a large fortune of up to ¬£35 million, the Marquess spent most of it during his lifetime. He struggled with addiction to cocaine and other drugs, serving several jail sentences for possession, and was known for his flamboyant lifestyle and homosexuality. His brief marriage in the mid-1980s did not last because of this, and he became increasingly depressed as he lost money and faced bankruptcy, culminating in the sale of the remainder of Ickworth House to the National Trust. He died in early 1999 of complications resulting from his drug addiction, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol. Early years and family arms Frederick William John Augustus Hervey was born on 15 September 1954, five years into the marriage between Victor Hervey, Earl Jermyn, the heir to the Marquessate of Bristol, and Pauline Bolton, daughter of a Kent business man. He was their only child and his parents divorced when he was five years old in 1959. He grew up in the family home, Ickworth House, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, and was a ward of court for some time after his mother left Ickworth. In April 1960, his father inherited the Marquessate of Bristol following the death of the 5th Marquess; John Hervey in turn gained the courtesy title of Earl Jermyn. The 5th Marquess, who had been jailed for jewel theft in his youth, behaved harshly towards his eldest son, according to friends of the family. He did not show John love or affection, and was strict to the extent that John was required to wear long white gloves during dinner. \\"He treated his son and heir with indifference and contempt,\\" said Anthony Haden-Guest. Jamie Spencer-Churchill, a schoolfriend, summed up the relationship: \\"Victor created the monster that John became.\\" His mother remarried giving him Teddy Lambton, a Newmarket racehorse trainer, for a stepfather, and then a half-brother, George, who became a Conservative councillor. In 1960, his father married secondly Lady Juliet Wentworth- Fitzwilliam, the only child of Peter Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 8th Earl Fitzwilliam. One son, Lord Nicholas Hervey, was born to this marriage. John Hervey was close to both his step-parents, whom he later recalled as being warm and generous. His father's final marriage was to his private secretary, Yvonne Marie Sutton, in 1974, giving him three more half-siblings: the incumbent Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol, media personality Lady Victoria Hervey, and Lady Isabella Hervey. John Hervey did not get on well with Yvonne, whom he referred to as \\"Miss Crimplene\\", and he reportedly hurled a glass at the wall when he received a telegram from his father announcing the marriage. Around this time, his father attempted to prove that John was an illegitimate child, so could not inherit his titles and estates, but was unsuccessful. He also stripped Ickworth House of its contents while John was away, and he came home one weekend to find everything suddenly missing. Along with his half-brother Nicholas, Earl Jermyn attempted to sue his father's estate after Yvonne and her children were named the principal beneficiaries in the 6th Marquess's will, but failed. Later years The Earl was educated at Harrow School and the University of Neuch√¢tel. He modelled himself on Oscar Wilde and began to use drugs and alcohol; the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography designates him a \\"wastrel\\". He inherited a million pounds when he was 16 years old, and another four million five years later. He eventually acquired a personal fortune worth up to ¬£35 million, including oil wells in Louisiana and a sheep farm in Australia. In his early 20s, he lived in a small flat and sold second hand Bentley cars; friends recall he was at his happiest during this time. He moved to Monte Carlo shortly after his father had relocated there in 1975 as a tax exile, but did not enjoy living there and moved to Paris, settling in a flat on the . While there, he became openly gay and had a partner, which was picked up by the tabloid gossip columns. He had moved to Manhattan by the end of the decade, and enjoyed throwing parties. The Earl was frequently depicted in the British tabloids for his drug use, wild parties and homosexuality. In May 1983, he was arrested on suspicion of trafficking $4 million of heroin and moved from New York back to Ickworth House. While there, on at least one occasion, the Earl piloted his helicopter without radar while snorting cocaine off the map he was using for navigation. On another, while accompanying his secretary Angela Barry, he crash-landed the helicopter in a field, and walked to the nearest farmhouse, demanding to use the phone while leaving mud everywhere. He became known for his dark sense of humour; on one occasion he allowed a young woman to ride a rubber dinghy into the middle of the lake at Ickworth and then shot at it with an air rifle, sinking it. On another, he was accused of opening a fridge door to retrieve a bottle of champagne by blasting it with a shotgun. He once drove along the hard shoulder of the M11 motorway at to avoid traffic congestion. Though the Earl had come out as homosexual, on 14 September 1984 he married Francesca Fisher, then 20, the day before his 30th birthday. In sharp contrast to the Earl, Fisher was a teetotaler and a vegetarian, and he hoped she would be a calming influence on his life. He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going as far as to place an advertisement in The Times that he had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started freebasing cocaine and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car half way over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life. The Earl inherited the title of Marquess of Bristol after his father died on 10 March 1985. Although Ickworth House had been given to the Treasury in lieu of death duties in 1956, and then handed over to the National Trust, he continued living there in the house's East Wing as part of the conditions. Following the collapse of his marriage, the Marquess became increasingly volatile. He blamed some of his difficulties on what he called \\"bad blood\\" and a \\"family disposition to depression\\". According to the Marquess, his father and mother both suffered from manic depression (now known as bipolar disorder) and he felt the same, though he appreciated that years of cocaine abuse had not helped matters. During this time, he saw his mother regularly, who was living in nearby Newmarket, using a helicopter to travel between there and Ickworth. In 1988, the Marquess was imprisoned for a year in Jersey for cocaine possession and trafficking; a contemporary report said he was spending around ¬£25,000 a year on the drug. He served seven months of the sentence and was released in April 1989. The National Trust were unimpressed with the Marquess' behaviour, including dangerous driving around the estate and lack of control over his wolfhounds. They attempted to evict him from Ickworth House in 1994 but withdrew the threat because of the Marquess' ill health. In turn, the Marquess was upset about having to share Ickworth House with public visitors to the gardens; he fired a shotgun repeatedly into the air, shouting \\"fucking peasants, fucking National Trust!\\" at people. The House of Lords, by then under threat of reform, generally disliked the Marquess as his behaviour was damaging the House's reputation. Final years and death The East Wing of Ickworth House, where the Marquess lived for most of his life By the early 1990s, friends were concerned about the Marquess's addiction to drugs, particularly since multiple prison sentences had done nothing to alleviate it. He was deported from Australia in April 1990 and charged with drug possession in November 1991 and March 1992. That October, his estate company was liquidated with debts over ¬£650,000. In June 1993, he avoided a jail sentence by being ordered to attend a rehabilitation clinic, but travelled to the South of France instead and was sentenced to 10 months in an open prison, where he was released after five. He was arrested again in September 1994 for possession. Facing bankruptcy, the Marquess sold most of the contents of Ickworth House at auction in March 1994 for ¬£2.3 million. He sold the remaining lease on the house back to the National Trust in April 1998, moving into Little Horringer Hall, a small house on the grounds. On 9 January 1999, he complained of a stomach ache and dizziness, and spent most of the day in bed. He was found dead the following morning. While there were rumours that the Marquess had died from AIDS, having apparently contracted HIV in 1986, the coroner recorded that he died of \\"multiple organ failure due to chronic drug abuse\\". A post-mortem examination showed traces of cocaine, as well as several legal drugs, in his system. His agent said that despite years of ill health through drug abuse, he was greatly shocked by his death. The Marquess' funeral took place on 23 February at Bury St Edmunds Cathedral. He was buried at Ickworth Church, as is traditional for all peers of the Hervey family. Legacy The 7th Marquess was succeeded by his half-brother, Frederick. His other paternal half-brother, Nicholas, had died a year before him, while his mother had died in 1996. The new Marquess did not attend his half-brother's funeral but expressed sadness at what had happened. He also said he was angry at being unable to live at Ickworth, as the remaining lease had been sold to the National Trust. His half-sister Victoria shared similar sentiments, and stated that she has avoided drugs as a result of her relationship with John. The 7th Marquess's maternal half-brother, George Lambton, said he had no hard feelings about the disappearance of the money, and that the Marquess had \\"packed more in his 44 years than most people do in their whole lives\\". The ¬£5,000 left in his estate was quickly taken up by expenses, mostly on his funeral. His will stipulated that ¬£100,000 should be left to Whitby and ¬£25,000 each to his butler, Thomas Foley, and his chauffeur; however it is unknown whether they were ever paid. A trust fund had been set up for Frederick, but his half-sisters received nothing. The House of Lords Act 1999 abolished most hereditary peers' rights; consequently, as well as having no residence at Ickworth, the 8th Marquess does not have a seat in the House. Following the 7th Marquess's death, his agent hoped that the story would serve as a warning over the dangers of drug addiction. Ickworth Church, which the 7th Marquess had bought in 1986 after commissioners declared it redundant, was inherited by the 8th Marquess and restored with a Heritage Lottery grant. The East Wing of Ickworth House was converted by the National Trust into a luxury hotel in 2002.

A long-running series regular, Mavis appeared in the show for 26 years from 1971 to 1997. Introduced for a one-off cameo appearance, she proved popular with producers and viewers and subsequently became a regular. Mavis was portrayed as moralising, repressed, and dithering, and often appeared in comic scenes with her boss Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) or her husband Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin). She was generally well received by critics, described as a national institution and one of Coronation Street's best loved characters, an old-fashioned spinster. Barlow has been praised for her portrayal of Mavis, a character notably spoofed by impressionist Les Dennis during the 1980s. Barlow decided to leave Coronation Street in 1997; her character left to run a guest house in Cartmel following the death of her husband. Barlow has said that the producers of Coronation Street have repeatedly asked her to return as Mavis, but she has so far declined. Storylines Born in Weatherfield, Mavis was brought up in Grange-over-Sands where her parents, despite being teetotal, ran an off- licence. Mavis first appears in Coronation Street in 1971 at Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) and Ernest Bishop's (Stephen Hancock) engagement party, as a friend/colleague of Emily's from the mail order warehouse and is invited to be a bridesmaid at the wedding. She is initially employed as a receptionist at the local vet and then as an assistant in the corner shop, but takes a job offered by Rita Littlewood (Barbara Knox) at The Kabin newsagents, 14 Rosamund Street. Mavis and Rita are complete opposites ‚Äì Rita sexy and self-assured, Mavis mouse-like and dowdy ‚Äì but they get on well and become friends. Rita often despairs at Mavis's choices in life, particularly when it comes to men. Rita's dominance over Mavis seems like bullying to outsiders, but she is only thinking of Mavis's best interests. In 1973, Mavis starts dating the equally shy Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), but it remains platonic. Jerry dies of a heart attack in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions. She meets salesman Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) the following year. They date, but the relationship is strained by Derek's interfering mother, who believes that Mavis is not good enough for her son. The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar. Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek ‚Äì feeling the same way she does ‚Äì did not attend the ceremony either. Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when he let her go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in November 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke, but neither care as they are genuinely in love. They spend evenings reading aloud to each other and discussing the events of the day. They remain happy despite the occasional problem, but their happiness is cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident. Devastated, at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years. Living in Weatherfield without Derek proves too difficult for Mavis. She surprises Rita when she suggests that they should move away and go into business together. They discuss the possibility of running a guest house in Cartmel, a village in the Lake District. Rita considers it but both realize that a partnership would not work. Mavis goes without her, buying a guest house and leaving Weatherfield in October 1997. She and Rita bid each other an emotional farewell, ending a partnership of 25 years. Creation and developmentCharacterisation= Mavis Riley's 1971 cameo appearance proved to be a hit with viewers, persuading the producers of Coronation Street to make her a regular character. It has been reported that Barlow based her portrayal of Mavis on a woman she had seen working in Granada studios (where Coronation Street is filmed) as well as \\"dozens of northern women she had seen battered into submission by worry\\". Discussing the woman who inspired Mavis's characterisation, Barlow said, \\"She had a strong core, but didn't show it. She was desperate to be liked but she didn't want to appear pushy.\\" Discussing her character, Barlow described Mavis as a \\"soppy thing\\", adding \\"she had great integrity, and she was a very loyal person. She would stick by her morality. She was a mouse to begin with, and then she met [her future husband] Derek and ... she learnt to be quite tough.\\" In Daran Little's book The Coronation Street Story Mavis is described as a \\"very creative person\\". She often met men through her creative endeavours, but her status as a spinster often led to feelings of bitterness, and she resented that her friend Emily had married two men before she had married once. Her lack of male attention led Mavis to be labelled the \\"eternal virgin\\" of Coronation Street. The serial's New Zealand broadcaster TVNZ described her as \\"flighty and romantic\\". The character has been discussed in a variety of publications. Hilary Kingsley in her book Soapbox discusses Mavis's reticent and moralistic personality as seen in her drinking habits: Mavis drinks fruit juices, but on special occasions sweet sherry: \\"two for Mavis is one too many\\" says Kingsley. In a 1983 issue of New Statesman magazine, Mavis is described as having a face that is \\"never quite sure of its own shape\\". The author describes the storyline featuring Mavis facing the prospect of a trial marriage or losing her boyfriend as an example of the \\"either-or situations\\" into which soap opera is \\"forever ensnaring its characters\\". An article in the Evening Standard said Mavis was \\"meek and mild\\" and \\"would not say boo to a budgie\\". In the same newspaper Mark Walton-Cook discusses Mavis's style, stating: \\"I keep picturing Corrie's Mavis Riley twittering and clutching at the high neck of a securely fastened polyester blouse with a tasteful cameo brooch\\". Mavis was frequently used to provide comic relief; she has been dubbed one of Coronation Street's comedy stars, well known for her catchphrase, \\"ooh, I don't really know\\". Susan Purdie writes that Mavis's storylines and persona often \\"hover between pathos and comedy\\". The critic David Meade agrees, noting that Mavis was \\"a permanent mourner-in-waiting\\". Sean-Day Lewis describes Mavis as \\"muddled and mousy\\", while Dennis Joseph Enright calls her a moralistic shop assistant who \\"no one takes very seriously\\". She was often spoofed by comedian Les Dennis in the 1980s; the character featured along with Dustin Gee's impression of Vera Duckworth in a variety of sketch shows. =Comedy partnerships= The producers of the show decided to pair Mavis with Rita Fairclough (Barbara Knox) by giving her a job in Rita's corner shop. Christine Geraghty has cited Mavis and Rita's friendship as an example of a soap opera portraying an important, stable, intimate female relationship: \\"Rita is Mavis's boss, but she is also one of her closest friends\\". A spinster for many years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often too shy to allow dating to progress beyond the initial stages of courtship. Ian Randall comments that \\"Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species\\". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), but it was more than a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, \\"She [Mavis] was quite a tough little character. You know, a lot of girls would have gone through with [the wedding], and she stuck to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to do it. That scene [where Rita supports her decision to jilt Derek] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, they stuck up for each other and [were] great friends, all the way through.\\" Richard Dyer perceives the Mavis and Derek characters to be as \\"shy physically\\" as one another, whereas Kathryn Hone, writing in The Sunday Times, considers Derek \\"even more dithering than Mavis\\". Nevertheless the on-screen relationship between the couple progresses quickly, despite the interference of Derek's mother. Actors Thelma Barlow and Peter Baldwin had worked together before their casting as Derek and Mavis, and the two became close friends. Derek and Mavis have been described by What's on TV as \\"an old-fashioned pair who were made for each other\\", and were typically featured in comic storylines, such as one in 1995 that saw their garden gnome kidnapped and transported around the world; Derek and Mavis received pictures of the gnome in various exotic locations, sent to them with ransom notes. It transpired that the kidnapper was Derek's friend Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden). The Daily Record labelled this storyline one of \\"Coronation Street's Classic Comic Moments\\" in 2008. Marilyn J. Matelski cites Mavis and Derek Wilton as examples of clever naming, in that the serial had created a fitting image of the characters before viewers even saw them together. =Departure= Barlow decided to leave the role of Mavis in 1997, having played it for 26 years. It was reported that she had quit following the axing of Peter Baldwin, who played her screen husband Derek Wilton. At the time Coronation Street was undergoing off-screen changes following the introduction of a new executive producer, Brian Park, dubbed \\"the axeman\\" in the press after he culled many characters from the regular cast. The actress Jean Alexander, who played the character of Hilda Ogden in the serial, went to the press in protest at the news. She wrote: \\"Peter Baldwin and Thelma Barlow were a wonderfully funny couple, but they've killed off Derek and now Mavis is about to leave. Even all the humour has been taken out of scenes between Mavis and Rita.\\" Park suggested that when he took over as head producer there was a general feeling among the programme-makers that \\"Derek and Mavis had had their day\\". Barlow has stated her belief that the producers killed off Derek as a result of her own desire to leave. She said: \\"It was sort of cruel, really; I mean, they could have killed Mavis off. It was a new director and a new producer, and they wanted to make a big news splash. It was very hard for Peter [who played Derek].\\" The village of Cartmel, near Grange-over-Sands, enjoyed a boost in tourism attributed to the exposure given to it by Mavis's storyline. In 2002 producers asked Barlow to return as Mavis, but she was too busy. In 2006 Barlow claimed that she had again been asked to return to Coronation Street, but had refused as she felt the storylines were not good enough for Mavis. Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, because she would be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997. Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that she would have liked Mavis to return to the serial. Reception Brian Meade of the Daily Mirror has suggested that Mavis was a \\"national institution\\" who enriched the life of millions. In the Scottish newspaper The Herald Alison Kerr listed Mavis as one of the female characters that in her opinion have been \\"the real pivot\\" in the serial, \\"ever ready with a sympathetic word\\". An article in the Huddersfield Daily Examiner said that Mavis was one of Coronation Street's best-loved characters, describing her as timid and \\"clad in sensible cardigan and shoes\\". Jules Stenson writing in The People said that Mavis was much like the previous character Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant): they were both \\"easily bullied\\" and, like Minnie, Mavis seemed to be \\"on the shelf for life\\" until her marriage to Derek. In Meade's opinion, Mavis gave a name to and represented a certain type of woman: \\"A 1940s spinster with a 1940s head who's looked 50 since birth. A Woman's Realm made flesh. And you have a name for her. She's a Mavis ... Mavis Riley was a masterpiece of observation\\". His opinion was shared by Gerlinde Frey-Vor and Julia Hallam, who consider Mavis to be a \\"model for a spinsterly type of woman\\". Brian Meade suggested that Barlow had \\"honed a comic gem until it cut into the national consciousness\\" in her characterisation of Mavis, likening her to other successful TV characters like Basil Fawlty, Del Boy Trotter and Alf Garnett. Meade applauded Barlow for staying true to Mavis's character for 26 years, \\"sustaining the most timid, world-weary of women with remarkable consistency. Try to recall her great lines and you are stumped. Every sentence she whimpered seemed to begin with 'Ooh Derek' and end with: 'Well, I don't really know, but he suggested that she had graced some of Coronation Street's \\"finest scenes\\", pointing to Mavis and Rita's spoof of a Laurel and Hardy act as one example. The character received various accolades over the years. At the TV Times \\"Corrie Awards\\", Mavis and Derek were nominated for \\"Best Couple\\", and Susannah Clapp listed Mavis in The Observer's \\"10 best Coronation Street characters\\" list. Clapp said \\"Thelma Barlow played [Mavis], with exceptional delicacy, in a variety of pastel pinnies, for 26 years.\\" She concluded that she had a \\"tumultuous relationship with her soulmate, Derek\\". When Barlow quit the role as Mavis in 1997, various Coronation Street stars praised her contribution: Sherrie Hewson (who played Maureen Holdsworth) said \\"Thelma's a wonderful lady and a superb actress. We'll miss her\\"; Michael Le Vell (Kevin Webster) said \\"Thelma's quality as an actress shone through for everyone to see after the death of Derek\\"; Peter Baldwin (Derek) said \\"It has made a difference to the programme and the departure of Derek and now Mavis is going to upset a lot of viewers\\". Mavis has been praised for providing Coronation Street with much comic relief via her partnerships with Rita and Derek. Reflecting on Mavis and Derek's partnership in 2010, Paul Vallely of The Independent said that they were an example of a \\"great double act\\", but he noted that they could not survive in the serial after it became focused on \\"dramatic storylines\\". Mavis has remained a popular and well-loved character. In 2010, thirteen years after her departure, Darren Fitzgerald wrote in The Sentinel (Stoke-on-Trent) that he wanted to see Mavis return to the serial and that he would have written out half of the cast and brought her back as a replacement. But Mavis has also been criticised: Jack Kibble-White, writing for MSN, called Mavis and Derek a \\"pathetic couple\\", suggesting that their gnome plot was one of the serial's most bizarre.

Cap-Chat is found west of Sainte-Anne-des-Monts. , Cap- Chat's population is 2,777. In addition to Cap-Chat itself, the town's territory also includes the communities of Cap-Chat-Est, Capucins, and Petit- Fonds.  History  The Cat Rock in Cap-Chat There are two theories about the origin of the town's name. One simply holds that the headland called Cap-Chat bore a likeness to a cat (\\"chat\\" in French). The other theory is a bit more fanciful. According to a local legend, a cat walking along the shore killed and ate various animals, whereupon the \\"cat fairy\\" accused him of having eaten her offspring. For his punishment, the cat was turned into stone for ever. It seems most likely, however, that the town's name is a corruption of \\"Aymar de Chaste\\", who was New France's lieutenant-general in 1603. The waterfront boardwalk at Cap-Chat has a display of photographs and informative plaques regarding the Second World War Battle of the St. Lawrence between U-Boats and coastal defence ships. Cap-Chat was one of the prime viewing areas for the total solar eclipse of July 10, 1972. Unfortunately, cloudy skies prevented most observers from viewing the total phase of the eclipse. On March 15, 2000, the Municipality of Capucins was amalgamated into the Town of Cap-Chat. Demographics Cap-Chat Church =Population= Economy  Cap-Chat has become synonymous with wind energy. There is a wind farm there containing 76 wind generators in revenue service. Each one of these is a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), but there is also to be seen there one called √âole, which is the world's tallest vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) at 110 m. It is capable of producing 4 MW of power, but has not been in use for more than ten years following damages sustained during a wind storm. Everything that there is to know about wind power at Cap-Chat may be learnt at the interpretative centre at the wind farm. Cap-Chat has other things that are worth seeing, such as the aforesaid cat-shaped headland, and a lighthouse. Those interested in wilderness and spectacular scenery can explore the areas inland from Cap-Chat, where there was once a village called Saint-Octave-de-l'Avenir (which ironically means Saint Octavius of the Future, though it's long in the past now). Salmon fishing and moose hunting are other activities available in the Cap-Chat area, as are hiking, horseback riding, and off-road four-wheel drive excursions in the back country. In winter, Cap-Chat has a downhill skiing centre, as well as trails for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling.

Unfortunately Otto died early, after which Skaf√∏g√•rd became a dower house for J√∏rgen's wife, Dorthe Lange (1541-1613) and after her death passed to their surviving son Holger. Rosenholm Castle was founded in 1559. J√∏rgen Rosenkrantz build three wings, while the fourth and last was first added by his son Holger Ottesen Rosenkrantz (1517-1575). Its architecture was very much different from other castles in Denmark. It was mostly inspired from Italy. On the main facade there was an open loggia. It was later extended, standing complete in 1607 with four wings, clearly influenced by the Italian Renaissance style. The castle interior was modernised in the 1740s in the baroque style, at which time a large baroque garden was laid out, covering an area of 5 ha., with avenues of limetrees and hedgerows of beech. =Sights & attractions= *Manor house milieu over 450 years *Anthroposophic paintings by the painter Arild Rosenkrantz. *Baroque park with symmetrical avenues. *Pirkentavl gazebo from around 1560.

December 4), 1852 in Saint Petersburg ‚Äì May 11, 1934 in Leningrad) was a Russian physicist and honorary member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (1920). He is most noted for being one of the first to study the gravitational lens effect. Orest, son of the noted Orientalist Daniel Chwolson, graduated from St. Petersburg University in 1873. He began teaching at his alma mater in 1876 and would become a professor in 1891. Orest Khvolson authored a number of works on electricity, magnetism, photometry, and actinometry. He proposed the designs of actinometer and pyrheliometer, which would be used by the Russian weather stations for a long time. After 1896, Khvolson was mainly engaged in compiling the five-volume Physics Course (–ö—É—Ä—Å —Ñ–∏–∑–∏–∫–∏), which would improve immensely the teaching of physics throughout the country and remain a principal textbook in universities for years to come. It was even translated into the German, French, and Spanish languages. His most noted accomplishment was in 1924, when he published about gravitational lenses in Astronomische Nachrichten, a scientific journal on astronomy. In the article he mentioned the ‚Äúhalo effect‚Äù of gravitation when the source, lens, and observer are in near-perfect alignment (now referred to as the Einstein ring), although he did not explicitly discuss the use of the ring as lens. The concept of gravitational lenses, did not get much attention until 1936, when Albert Einstein wrote about the gravitational lens effect. The \\"halo\\" effect of a gravitational lens, where one source (sun or galaxy) produces a ring around another source is referred to as an Chwolson ring, or Einstein ring. He became an honorary member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. The crater Khvolson on the Moon is named after him.

He had been detained without charge in Guantanamo Bay since 2002.documents (.pdf) from Fouzi Khalid Abdullah Al Awda's Combatant Status Review Tribunal He was a plaintiff in the ongoing case, Al Odah v. United States, which challenged his detention, along with that of fellow detainees. The case was widely acknowledged to be one of the most significant to be heard by the Supreme Court in the current term. The US Department of Defense reports that he was born in 1977, in Kuwait City, Kuwait. U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly's ruling on al Odah's habeas corpus petition was published on September 1, 2009. She denied his habeas corpus petition based on the assumption that it was more likely than not that Awda was a foot soldier fighting in Afghanistan against US troops. Fouzi Khalid Abdullah al Awda arrived at the Guantanamo detention camps on February 28, 2002, where he remained for 12 years, 8 months, 8 days until his transfer to Kuwait's rehabilitation program for former Guantanamo detainees on November 5, 2014. Alleged affiliation with al Qaeda The U.S. Government contends that al Odah's true purpose in Afghanistan was to join the Taliban and al Qaeda. Supporting this, al Odah's name and phone number appeared in a document found on the official al Qaeda website, and his passport was recovered from an al Qaeda safehouse in Karachi. The appellate court's rejection of his habeas corpus petition also refers to \\"additional incriminating evidence\\" discovered since his capture, however the nature of that evidence is redacted in the unclassified version of the opinion. Capture According to an interview Fawzi's father, Khalid al-Odah, gave to Amnesty International, Fawzi traveled in 2001 to the Pakistan/Afghanistan border area in order to do charitable outreach work,Interview with Khalid al- Odah, father of Fawzi Al-Odah who is detained in Guantanamo Bay , Amnesty International, June 1, 2005 Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, Fawzi fled Afghanistan, intending to return home to Kuwait. Fawzi successfully crossed the border into Pakistan but was then captured by Pakistanis that his father alleges were bounty hunters who handed Fawzi and eleven other Kuwaitis over to American authorities. The Kuwaitis were then transported to Cuba. Official status reviews Originally the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the \\"war on terror\\" were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention. In 2004, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them. =Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants= Following the Supreme Court's ruling, the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants. Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, studied the OARDEC documents and listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations: * Fouzi Khalid Abdullah Al Awda was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... are associated with both Al Qaeda and the Taliban.\\" * Fouzi Khalid Abdullah Al Awda was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges that the following detainees stayed in Al Qaeda, Taliban or other guest- or safehouses.\\" * Fouzi Khalid Abdullah Al Awda was listed as one of the captives who \\"The military alleges ... were at Tora Bora.\\" * Fouzi Khalid Abdullah Al Awda was listed as one of the captives whose \\"names or aliases were found on material seized in raids on Al Qaeda safehouses and facilities.\\" * Fouzi Khalid Abdullah Al Awda was listed as one of the captives who was a foreign fighter. * Fouzi Khalid Abdullah Al Awda was listed as one of the \\"34 [captives] admit to some lesser measure of affiliation‚Äîlike staying in Taliban or Al Qaeda guesthouses or spending time at one of their training camps.\\" * Fouzi Khalid Abdullah Al Awda was listed as one of the captives who had admitted \\"some form of associational conduct.\\" =Habeas petition -- Al Odah v. United States= Habeas corpus petition of Fouzi Khalid Abdullah Al Odah et al Al Odah v. United States is a writ of habeas corpus petition on behalf of Guantanamo detainees. This consolidated case currently represents four plaintiffs: Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad Al Odah, Fayiz Mohammed, Ahmed Al Kandari, Khalid Abdullah Mishal Al Mutairi, and Fouad Mahmoud Al Rabiah. Al Odah v. United States was originally filed April 2002 on behalf of twelve imprisoned Kuwaitis, including Al Odah, seeking the right of habeas corpus. The case was dismissed in May 2002 following a government motion to dismiss the habeas corpus petition. On June 28, 2004, the Supreme Court issued an opinion on a related Guantanamo case, Rasul v. Bush, affirming the right of Guantanamo detainees to challenge their imprisonment in the U.S. federal court system. Under this ruling, detainees such as those represented in Al Odah would be able to file habeas corpus petitions in U.S. courts. In April 2007, the Supreme Court declined to hear two cases challenging the Military Commissions Act: Boumediene v. Bush and Al Odah v. United States On June 29, 2007, the court reversed that decision, releasing an order that expressed their intent to hear the challenge. The two cases have been consolidated into one. Oral arguments were heard on December 5, 2007. The decision, striking down the Military Commissions Act, was handed down on June 12, 2008. On July 18, 2008, David J. Cynamon filed a \\"PETITIONERS‚Äô STATUS REPORT\\" in Al Odah, v. United States Civil Action No. CV 02-0828 (CKK) on behalf of Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad Al Odah, Fayiz Mohammed Ahmen Al Kandari, Khalid Abdullah Mishal Al Mutairi, Fouad Mahmoud Al Rabiah. He wrote that they were the four remaining Kuwaiti captives in Guantanamo. He wrote that none of the four men had been cleared for release. He wrote that the government had completed \\"factual returns\\" for all four men‚Äîbut those factual returns had contained redacted sections. =Joint Review Task Force= When he assumed office in January 2009, President Barack Obama made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo. He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp. He promised to institute a new review system. That new review system was composed of officials from six departments, where the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. When it reported back, a year later, the Joint Review Task Force classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was no evidence to justify laying charges against them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request. Fouzi Khalid Abdullah Al Awda was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release. Although Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board less than a quarter of men have received a review. Meetings with attorneys On September 28, 2005, the Associated Press reported on a meeting between attorneys Thomas Wilner and Kristine Huskey and their Kuwaiti clients.Lawyers Visit Detainees on Hunger Strike, Washington Post, September 21, 2005 According to Wilner and Huskey, al-Odah and four of his compatriots, were on a hunger strike and had lost a dangerous amount of weight. They reported that al-Odah had been force-fed and could barely sit up. Human Rights critics argue that the detainees retain the right to give or withhold consent to all medical procedures. According to Fawzi's lawyer, Thomas Wilner, Fawzi wanted Wilner to file a legal request ordering the removal of his feeding tube. Wilner did file such a request because Fawzi's family was \\"frantic\\" and opposed the motion. Wilner said that at the time, Fawzi looked \\"like a skeleton\\". Al-Odah told his lawyers that camp authorities had warned the hunger strikers that they would start strapping them in \\"restraint chairs\\" during their force-feedings.Gitmo detainees say force led to drop in number on hunger strike at U.S. base , Findlaw, February 9, 2006 In an interview in Marie Claire magazine, Huskey described her surprise that when she first met with Guantanamo clients, like al-Odah, they preferred food brought from Guantanamo fast food outlets to the Arabic delicacies she and her colleagues had brought from the Continental US. She reported that al-Odah's favorite was MacDonald's French Fries and ice cream. Media Editorials Fawzi al-Odah's father, Khalid al-Odah, wrote an Op-Ed in the Washington Post, on September 2, 2006, entitled: \\"Put My Son on Trial -- or Free Him\\".Put My Son on Trial -- or Free Him, Washington Post, September 2, 2006 In the article Khalid argues that \\"hundreds of innocent men sit in prison\\", who could have been freed, if American authorities had granted them the protections of the rule of law and granted them a fair trial in a traditional court of law. Al Odah's father stated that Fawzi had always been an admirer of the American system. The Washington Post identifies Khalid Al-Odah as the founder of the Kuwaiti Family Committee. It states: > The writer founded the Kuwaiti Family Committee four years ago to secure the > legal rights of foreign nationals imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay. The New York Times editorial board has spoken out in favor of the plaintiffs in the Al Odah v. United States case, calling it \\"the Supreme Court showdown of the year\\".\\"Civil liberties groups ‚Äî and this Editorial Board\\", write the editors, \\"believe it is important for the Supreme Court to make clear that the detainees have a constitutional right to have a judge determine whether they are being properly held.\\".The Supreme Court Showdown of the Year, The New York Times, October 23, 2007 On May 12, 2007, the Kuwait Times reported that Kuwait and the USA concluded negotiations regarding the repatriation of the remaining Kuwaiti captives. Nevertheless, Khaled Al Mutayri, Fouzi Khalid Abdullah Al Awda, Fouad Mahoud Hasan Al Rabia and Faiz Mohammed Ahmed Al Kandari continue to be held as of August 1, 2009. US District Court Judge Colleen Kollar- Kottely ordered the immediate repatriation of Khaled Al Mutairi on July 29, 2009. According to The Jurist the habeas corpus cases for the other three men are expected to conclude in August and September 2009. Kollar-Kotelly ruled on al Odah's habeas corpus petition on August 24, 2009. The 32-page ruling was published on September 1, 2009, after classified portions had been redacted. She ruled that the USA could consider al Odah was an \\"enemy combatant\\", without regard to whether the training camp he attended was actually the al Farouq training camp, because he had acknowledged attending a training camp, for a single day. Renewed repatriation negotiations In July 2013, Cynamon said the Obama administration was renewing repatriation negotiations after \\"years of radio silence\\". Repatriated in November 2014 He was repatriated in November 2014, following the recommendation of the Periodic Review Board.

The stadium is mainly used for rugby league and the A-League, and is one of the home grounds of the National Rugby League (NRL) team St. George Illawarra Dragons. The stadium has hosted football matches, including hosting Sydney Olympic FC in the 2003‚Äì04 National Soccer League and recently, Sydney FC in the 2018‚Äì19 and 2019‚Äì20 A-League due to the rebuild of the Sydney Football Stadium. The ground hosted its first game of rugby league in March 1936 when the St. George Dragons were defeated by the Newtown Bluebags in an exhibition match. The stadium has undergone several constructions over the years and one is still being planned for the foreseeable future. The first official game was played on 22 April 1950 in which the Dragons lost 17‚Äì15 to South Sydney. History A view of the scoreboard at the north-eastern corner of the ground. Jubilee Oval stands on part of the original grant of awarded on 23 December 1853 to Archibald McNab. Edmund English purchased the grant on 23 May 1854 for around 400 pounds. It officially became known as Kogarah Park when it was acquired by the Department of Lands on 1 July 1896 and dedicated as the first public park in Kogarah. Control of the park was eventually passed to the Council of the Municipality of Kogarah on 29 August 1906, which became Kogarah City and on 12 May 2016 Georges River Council. During Kogarah's Jubilee celebrations in 1935, Jubilee Stadium was constructed in Kogarah Park. Development The ground was closed from 1986 until the end of 1988 because of the construction of the new grandstand being built on the western side of the ground. During this time the Dragons played their home games at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1986 and 1987, while using Belmore Oval, the home of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, in 1988. Since 2003, Jubilee Oval has been steadily upgraded in a three-stage plan, funded by the NSW State Government and Federal Government. In 2006, the ground had been updated with new features to the seating around the grandstand and features directly out of the stadium including re-developments to the Hall of Fame walk and Kogarah Park in front of the stadium. Stage 1 consisted of new terraced seating at the north-western end, perimeter seating at the base of the hill, and a regrassed and raised hill area. Floodlights for televising night matches were also installed. In 2007, the Dragons announced that they would not be playing home games at Kogarah for the 2008 season so that Stage 2 redevelopment of the ground could be completed with new roofed extension on the southern side of the main grandstand, increasing capacity by around 2000, and further upgrading to the hill area, including turnstile facilities and strengthening the retaining wall at the Southern Jubilee Avenue end. The Dragons returned for 2009 against the Sharks in round 3, and broke the club record for highest Crowd at the ground. In 2010, the Dragons secured $13m from the NSW State Government to complete the Stage 3 Northern grandstand extension, with an additional 1580 seats and the replacement of 1730 seats in the existing main grandstand.$13 million Govt boost to upgrade WIN Jubilee Oval ‚Äì NRL.com Also included in the development are additional public toilets and facilities, refurbishment of the existing grandstand facilities including the team change rooms, a new passenger and service lift, additional corporate and multi purpose facilities, and a museum and merchandise store. A new digital scoreboard and several satellite scoreboards, new security system, turnstiles and ticketing facilities at Gate B and a rainwater harvesting tank were also installed around the ground during 2010 and 2011.

From 1950 until 2003, the ground was simply known as Jubilee Oval. In 2003, printing and data communications company OKI signed a five-year sponsorship deal for naming rights to the ground with the name becoming OKI Jubilee Stadium. In October, 2008, OKI Printing Solutions decided not to renew the naming rights of Jubilee Oval, as the Dragons played at ANZ Stadium during the 2008 season due to re-developments at Jubilee. The naming rights ended on 31 October with the park reverting to its former name. It was officially announced on 25 December 2008, that WIN Corporation had bought the naming rights for Jubilee Oval. With this agreement, WIN owned the naming rights to both of St. George Illawarra's home grounds, WIN Jubilee Oval and WIN Stadium. In early 2014, WIN backed out of this sponsorship, with the ground once again reverting to its original name. From 2016, the University of Wollongong held the rights to the ground for a two-year period, ending in late 2017. The ground was known as \\"UOW Jubilee Oval\\". In January 2019 strata management company Netstrata signed a three-year sponsorship deal for the naming rights of the ground with the name becoming \\"Netstrata Jubilee Oval\\". This decision was confirmed at a special Council meeting on 11 February 2019.Georges River Council tackles Jubilee Stadium naming rights claims St George Leader 12 February 2019. * Jubilee Oval (1950‚Äì2003, 2008, 2014 ‚Äì 2015) * OKI Jubilee Stadium (2003‚Äì2008) * WIN Jubilee Oval (2009‚Äì2013) * UOW Jubilee Oval (2016‚Äì2017) * Jubilee Stadium (2018) * Netstrata Jubilee Stadium (2019-2020) The ground is usually simply referred to as \\"Kogarah Oval\\" by the media and fans. UsesRugby league=St. George DRLFC The St. George DRLFC which commenced competing in Sydney's top level in the 1921 NSWRFL season, had an unsuccessful debut game at Jubilee Oval in 1936 when they were defeated by Newtown in an exhibition match as part of the Jubilee celebrations. The gate-takings from the match were donated to the St. George Hospital. Saints at this stage were still based at Arncliffe's Earl Park and it wasn't until 1950 that Saints returned home to Jubilee Stadium. The Dragons played their first official match at the ground on 22 April 1950 against the South Sydney Rabbitohs before 12,500 fans. The Dragons lost a rather exciting match 17‚Äì15 but defeat would become quite a rare sight for the Dragons over the coming decades while at Kogarah. St. George were based at Kogarah during their world record breaking 11 successive premierships from 1956 to 1966. They set a record at Kogarah and were not beaten at home for an astonishing twelve years: originally beaten by the Balmain Tigers on 26 June 1954 at Kogarah which was just before the beginning of the streak. It wasn't until 31 July 1966, that they tasted defeat at Kogarah again, eventually losing 12‚Äì9 to the Western Suburbs Magpies. In 1950, the Dragons began a permanent association with the ground. Around this time was also when St. George legend Norm Provan joined the club and he said of Kogarah: The team was based at Jubilee Stadium right up until the completion of the 1985 season. They then chose to abandon the ground and relocated to the Sydney Cricket Ground. The decision was one which they would come to dread. In 1985 St. George had been Club champions, 1st Grade Minor premiers, 1st Grade Runners-Up, Reserve Grade Premiers and Under-23s Premiers. In 1986 Saints missed the semi-finals in all 3 grades for the first time in 50 years. The fans of the club became angry at the club's decision and stayed away from the club in droves while the Dragons remained at the SCG for a further season. In 1988 the opportunity came for the club to relocate again. Instead of moving back to Jubilee they decided to move to Belmore Oval. Finally, in 1988 it was decided that the Saints would move home to Jubilee in 1989 with a new stand to be constructed for the 1990 season. The club yet again moved in the late 1990s and explained to fans the decision was on the basis that Jubilee was too small to accommodate a proposed $30 million stadium complex to meet NRL requirements for playing venues. In a joint statement, Kogarah Council and St. George DRLFC stated that the scale of the proposed 20,000-seat stadium would exceed the size of Jubilee Oval and affect residents. The decision to leave Jubilee upset many of St George Illawarra's loyal supporters as the ground had so much history to it and in July 2000 many supporters held a rally in support of the ground. In March 2002, the R2K (Return to Kogarah) group held a successful Information Night at the Kogarah RSL to support a return to Jubilee Oval and successfully lobbied for the Dragons to play matches at Kogarah from 2003 onwards. St George Illawarra Dragons A view of the ground prior to a match between the St. George Illawarra Dragons and Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in August 2018. The St George Illawarra Dragons, formed as the result of a merger between St George and the Illawarra Steelers in 1999, use Kogarah as one of their home grounds in the National Rugby League, along with the Steelers former home, WIN Stadium in Wollongong. The newly formed Dragons used Kogarah in the 1999 NRL season, before moving their games to the Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) in 2000. From 2000 until 2002, after many loyal Dragons supporters held a rally and Information Night to persuade the club to move back to Jubilee Stadium (while at the SFS, the team had continued using WIN Stadium), the club did so and would be yet again occupying the famous rugby league ground. During these 3 years that the Dragons did not play at Kogarah, there were talks with the club that they would play at the nearby St George Soccer Stadium, but plans fell through and the soccer stadium has since fallen into disrepair. The Dragons returned to Kogarah in 2003 after a high number of protests and rallies held by supporter group R2K (or Return to Kogarah).

The game was played in driving rain, which many gave as the reason for a crowd of only 9,075 in attendance. The club did not play at the ground in 2008 because of renovations of the south-western end grandstand being built. During this time, the Dragons played at ANZ Stadium.

DeGroote, OC (born 1933) is a Canadian businessman and philanthropist from Hamilton, Ontario who currently resides in Bermuda. Aside from his business career, he is best known as a major private donor to local educational institutions such as McMaster University, McMaster University Medical School and Hillfield Strathallan College. Early life DeGroote was born in Belgium to Flemish parents and immigrated to Canada with his parents when he was 14 years old. He left school in Grade 9 to help his family by working in the tobacco fields near Tillsonburg, Ontario. Business career In 1959 he purchased Laidlaw Transport Ltd., a small trucking company based in Hagersville, Ontario. Under his direction, Laidlaw expanded past trucking by entering the solid waste and school bus industries. By the mid 1970s Laidlaw was a large and successful business, and DeGroote had personally become wealthy enough that he was able to purchase the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League. He was the last owner of the Tiger Cats to make profit from the team. In March 1988, DeGroote sold his Laidlaw shares to Canadian Pacific; in return, he received a combination of cash and CP shares worth $499 million. In 1990, he retired to Bermuda. However, controversy followed him after his departure: in December 1990, he resigned as a Laidlaw director, and in August 1992, Laidlaw paid $7.65 million to settle a class action lawsuit which had alleged that Laidlaw's corporate officers had \\"misrepresented the financial condition of Laidlaw.\\" DeGroote also paid $23 million to the Ontario Securities Commission to settle a claim regarding insider trading of Laidlaw stock. Though still residing in Bermuda, DeGroote has been involved in a number of business ventures since his retirement, such as Republic Waste, AutoNation, NRX Global Inc and Century Business Services. Awards and philanthropy In 1990, DeGroote was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1992, he made a major donation to McMaster University which funded the construction of a new business school, which was subsequently renamed the Michael G. DeGroote School of Business. The same year, he received an honorary degree from McMaster. In 2003, he donated $105 million to McMaster, which funded a number of medical research centres as well as a building, the Michael G. DeGroote Centre for Learning and Discovery (commonly abbreviated as MDCL to avoid confusion with the DeGroote School of Business). In addition, the McMaster School of Medicine was renamed to the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster in 2004.http://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/Fulltext/2005/09000/Michael_G__DeGroote_School_of_Medicine,_McMaster.13.aspx Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine, McMaster University In 2009, he donated $10.5 million to Hillfield Strathallan College, which added to existing funds for the planned campus restructuring and the new Senior School building which will bear his name. DeGroote was made an honorary member of Hillfield Strathallan's 2009 graduating class. In 2014, at the McMaster University Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine graduation ceremony, Michael took the stage to announce a gift of $50 million. The gift will support increased focus on national and international health leadership, including developing stronger ties with McMaster's DeGroote School of Business as well as partnerships that focus on biomedical advances. Additionally, a new fund will be created to seed the very best medical research within the Faculty of Health Sciences.

Jay's Longhorn Bar, most frequently referred to by patrons as The Longhorn, was a nexus of the punk music scene in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, described by music critics as a legendary part of the genre's history and a \\"punk rocker's paradise.\\" One of the earliest clubs in America to regularly book punk, New Wave, and alternative-rock bands, the Longhorn was the only concert stage in Minnesota where touring acts in those genres could regularly perform until the opening of what would become First Avenue in 1980.Cost, J., Earles, A., Fritch, M., Hickey, M., Klinge, S., Miller, E., Olson, D., Rowland, H., Ryan, M., and Valania, J.: A Tale of Twin Cities: H√ºsker D√º, the Replacements and the Rise and Fall of the ‚Äô80s Minneapolis Scene, Magnet, June 12, 2005. \\"The Police, Blondie, all the big acts played there,\\" wrote H√ºsker D√º guitarist Bob Mould, who frequented the venue and noted that he considered H√ºsker D√º \\"an actual band\\" only after they had performed on the Longhorn stage. Robert Wilkinson, singer for Minneapolis punk band Flamingo, noted that in terms of importance to the scene, ‚ÄúThe Longhorn was Minneapolis‚Äô CBGB‚Äôs.‚Äù The Longhorn was also an important crucible of the local punk-rock scene. It was the first bar ever played by both of the scene's most highly influential bands, H√ºsker D√º (on May 13, 1979) and the Replacements (on July 2, 1980). Peter Jesperson, the Replacements' manager and a founder of Twin/Tone Records, who was also a DJ at the Longhorn at that time, signed the band to Twin/Tone immediately after that performance. Influential Minneapolitan New Wave band The Suburbs also had their first major success at the Longhorn; drummer Hugo Klaers said that after getting regular gigs at the venue, \\"we went from nobodies to this super popular band. It was just crazy. The Longhorn shows were always packed.\\" Located at 14 South Fifth Street in downtown Minneapolis, the Longhorn was opened by owner Jay Berine on June 1, 1977, with help from general manager- artist director-musician/Songwriter Al Wodtke (of Badfinger, KYX, Crow, and Apostles). Its first headliner was Minneapolis band Flamingo, while the first national act to be booked was New York rock group Mink DeVille. The Longhorn became a notable punk rock and hardcore punk venue, booking bands such as the Clash, Buzzcocks, Gang of Four, Talking Heads, Dead Boys, Robert Gordon, Iggy Pop, the Stranglers, the Flamin' Oh's, The Suburbs, the Suicide Commandos, the Hypstrz, Naked Raygun, the Effigies, the Ramones, Pere Ubu, Lily Tomlin, the Plasmatics, Elvis Costello, Curtiss A, and the Nerves. Before it was an established punk rock venue, the Longhorn hosted a thriving jazz scene. It was home base for the progressive jazz group Natural Life and brought with it many national and international jazz acts. Chris Osgood, singer-guitarist of the Suicide Commandos, described the Longhorn as \\"like CBGB in that it was a long bar with a low ceiling and the band was up on a riser at one end of the room. It had been a Nino's Steakhouse before it turned into a bar, so it was not a dump.\\" The bar was later sold to a new owner, Hartley Frank, who changed it into a pizzeria called Zoogies in the spring of 1982. The location is now a storage center for Xcel Energy. In popular culture The club is the setting of a scene in Jonathan Franzen's 2010 novel Freedom, in which the protagonists attend a performance by the Buzzcocks. (Although the novel is fictional, the concert, which took place September 10, 1979, was real.) Nostalgia for the heyday of the venue was the focus of Minnesota musician Dylan Hicks's song \\"The Longhorn Days\\", from his 1998 album Poughkeepsie. On May 16, 2015, a \\"Longhorn Bar Reunion\\" was held at First Avenue and 7th St Entry in Minneapolis. Local bands and performers (including X-Boys, Curtiss A, Hypstrz, Flamin'-Oh's, Yipes! and members of The Suburbs and the Suicide Commandoes, billed as \\"the Sub-Commandoes\\"), many containing members who played at Jay's Longhorn, paid tribute.

Without approval of the agency, a film could not be legally shown in Maryland. The agency was also charged with enforcing their decisions. The first agency decision to be appealed was the board's decision to ban the pacifist film War Brides (1916). The film had been approved in March 1917 for showing in state theaters, but shortly after the United States entered World War I, the film was banned in 1917 as it might affect military recruitment and for its pacifism. In 1918 a Baltimore City circuit court upheld the censorship board's decision. The court ruling was based on an Attorney General opinion that films calculated to obstruct or discourage recruitment were detrimental to the public morals. One agency decision against a film led to the Supreme Court case Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51 (1965), which placed significant restrictions on state censorship statutes. In 1970 the authority of the State Board of Censors was assigned to the newly created Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. Due in part to rising costs of maintenance, the board was dissolved in 1981. At the time of its disbanding, it was the last state-specific film censorship agency in the United States.

HistoryBarker Office Supply= Staples Business Advantage can trace its history back to 1871. Samuel Barker, Jr., who had lied about his age so he could fight in the Civil War (Wisconsin 37th Regiment), afterward went to Cleveland in 1865 with 35 cents in his pocket. There he peddled papers, and in 1871 started a printing business. His business was quite successful and was still in the family a century later.Case Western Reserve University, Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, \\"Barker Office Supply\\" (https://case.edu/ech/articles/b/barker-office-supply-co/) Retrieved, November 2017.United States Federal Census, pg. 26, Supervisor's District 6, Enumerator's District 37, Cleveland, Ohio, June 1880.1890 Veterans Schedule, \\"Special Schedule: Surviving Soldiers, Sailors and Marines, and Widows, Etc.,\\" pg. 2, S.D. 6, E.D. 154, Minor Civil Division: Brooklyn Village, Ohio.\\"S. Barker's Sons Company in New Plant,\\" Office Appliances magazine, p. 43, September 1922. He opened his business with two small presses, a small steam engine, a hand cutter and some stationery stock. In 1890, his son, Raymond H. Barker, joined the firm. In 1911, S. Barker & Sons was incorporated, and in 1923, a grandson, Raymond M. Barker, joined the growing firm. The company became one of the leading office-supply firms in northern Ohio, and by the 1950s was also offering metal and wood office furniture. By 1986, it was known as Barker Office Supply Company, with John S. Barker (a great-grandson of Samuel Barker, Jr.) as president. In 1989, the company was sold to Spectrum Office Supply of Rochester, New York, and in 1994, it was sold again, to Staples, which renamed the company Staples Business Advantage. John S. Barker retired from the company in 1989, but another of Samuel Barker, Jr's. great- grandsons, James Barker, remained with the company as a vice president. =Buhrmann= Buhrmann N.V. was initially formed from KNP BT, a paper, packaging and printing industry distribution company, founded in 1993 by the simultaneous merger of three companies: Koninklijke Nederlandsche Papierfabrieken (KNP), B√ºhrmann-Tetterode and VRG-Groep. Across 1997 and 1998, the paper and packaging business areas were divested, leaving just the distribution interest, covering BT Office Products as well as graphic systems and paper merchandising businesses. KNP BT was renamed Buhrmann N.V. in July 1998. =Corporate Express Corporation= Corporate Express was founded by Jirka Rysavy, also the founder of Gaiam, in 1986 in Boulder, Colorado. Initially a regional office products retailer with 11 employees located in one small building, the company established a program of strategic procurement solutions as an industry innovation. In 1991, Corporate Express became a public company with reported revenues of $621 million annually. Through acquisition of approximately 200 companies by the end of 1999, the company added to its product lines, customer services and geographic breadth. By January 1999, its last full year SEC filing, Corporate Express had revenues of $3.75B. =Buhrmann and Corporate Express Merger= In October 1999, Buhrmann acquired its competitor Corporate Express Corporation and combined it with BT Office Products. Corporate Express became the name of the office products arm of Buhrmann N.V.. In May 2001, Corporate Express acquired substantially all of the US Office Products (USOP) North American office products assets, including certain stand-alone furniture businesses. USOP's North American office products operations were integrated into Corporate Express, resulting in expected revenues of approximately $5 billion in North America. As a result, many board members of USOP gained spots on the board of Corporate Express. In 2003, Jirka Rysavy fully retired at age 48. The company's new focus on a single business area was consolidated when its paper merchandising division was sold to Australia's PaperlinX in October 2003, leaving only the office- related products business. Reflecting the new single focus, it was decided to change the name of the company to Corporate Express N.V. in April 2004.Weak Economic Data Sends Markets Tumbling To Sharply Lower Close =Staples acquisition of Corporate Express= United States-based office supplies retailer Staples Inc. launched an unsolicited acquisition bid for the company on 19 February 2008, offering ‚Ç¨7.25 per share. The Corporate Express board rejected the offer, saying that the price undervalued the company. In a move widely seen as an attempt to stave off interest from Staples, the president announced a planned ‚Ç¨1.4 billion takeover of French rival Lyreco on 21 May, only for Staples to make an increased offer of ‚Ç¨9.15 per share on 3 June. After this too was rejected, a final offer of ‚Ç¨9.25 per share (valuing Corporate Express at ‚Ç¨1.68 billion) was accepted by the board on 11 June. The proposed Lyreco acquisition was subsequently abandoned. With over 95% of its stock acquired by Staples, Corporate Express was removed from the AEX index on 4 July 2008. Shares of the company were delisted on 5 August as Staples gained full control. This Buyout of 1.68 billion Euro, Equal to 2,204,910,223.03 USD, was one of the biggest of the decade. Corporate Express is now part of Staples Advantage.

She was the youngest of the 36 children of Sayyid Said bin Sultan Al-Busaid, Sultan of Zanzibar and Oman. She is the author of Memoirs of an Arabian Princess from Zanzibar. Early life in Zanzibar Salama bint Said was born on 30 August 1844, the daughter of Sultan Said and Jilfidan, a Circassian concubine. Her first years were spent in the huge Bet il Mtoni palace, by the sea about eight kilometres north of Stone Town. (The palace was mostly demolished in 1914.) She grew up bilingual in Arabic and Swahili. In 1851 she moved to Bet il Watoro, the house of her brother Majid bin Said of Zanzibar, the later sultan. Her brother taught her to ride and to shoot. In 1853 she moved with her mother to Bet il Tani. She secretly taught herself to write, a skill which was unusual for women at the time. When her father died in 1856 she was declared of age, twelve years old, and received her paternal inheritance. This consisted of a plantation with a residence, and 5,429 pounds. After her father's death, her brother Sayyid Thuwaini bin Said al-Said became Sultan of Muscat and Oman, while her brother Majid became Sultan of Zanzibar. In 1859 her mother died and Salme received her maternal inheritance, three plantations. The same year a dispute broke out between her brothers Majid and Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar. Though she favoured Majid, her favourite sister Khwala made her side with Barghash. Because she could write she acted (at the age of fifteen) as secretary of Barghash's party. With the help of an English gunboat the insurrection of Barghash was soon brought to an end; Barghash was sent into exile in Bombay for two years and Salme withdrew to Kisimbani, one of her estates. Salme eventually moved back to Stone Town and made up with Majid. This earned her the lasting enmity from Barghash, as well as a split with her favourite sister Khwala. Emily with her husband and two of their children While living in Stone Town she became acquainted with her neighbour, a German merchant, Rudolph Heinrich Ruete (born 10 March 1839; died 6 August 1870) and became pregnant by him. In August 1866, after her pregnancy had become obvious, she fled on board the British frigate commanded by Captain [Thomas] Malcolm Sabine Pasley R.N. and was given passage on his ship to the British colony of Aden. There she took Christian instruction and was baptised prior to her marriage at Aden on 30 May 1867. Nonetheless, in a later letter to her sister, she avoided eating pork and dreaded attending church, stressing that she remained Muslim in secret. She had given birth to a son, Heinrich, in Aden in December 1866; he died in France en route to Germany in the summer of 1867. Life in Europe The Ruetes settled in Hamburg, where they had another son and two daughters. They were: *Antonia Thawke Ruete (24 March 1868‚Äì?), who married Eugene Brandeis (1846‚Äì1919) in 1898 and had two daughters. *Rudolph Said-Ruete (13 April 1869 ‚Äì 1 May 1946) (:nl:Rudolph Said-Ruete). A journalist and author, with the rise of the Nazi Party, he resigned his German citizenship in 1934 and settled in London, becoming a British subject and dying at Lucerne, Switzerland after World War II. In 1901, he married Mary Therese Matthias (1872‚Äì?) and had a son and a daughter, Werner Heinrich (1902-1962) and Salme Matilda Benvenuta Olga (1910‚Äì?). Through his marriage, he was a cousin of Alfred Moritz, 1st Baron Melchett, who became the first chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries. *Rosalie Ghuza Ruete (16 April 1870-14 February 1948), who married Major-General Martin Troemer of the Royal Prussian Army. Her husband died in 1870 after a tram accident, leaving Ruete in difficult economic circumstances because the authorities denied her inheritance claims. Partly to alleviate these economic problems she wrote Memoirs of an Arabian Princess from Zanzibar, first published as Memoiren einer arabischen Prinzessin in the German Empire in 1886, and shortly afterwards published in the United States and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The book provides the first known autobiography of an Arab woman. The book presents the reader with an intimate picture of life in Zanzibar between 1850 and 1865, and an inside portrait of her brothers Majid bin Said of Zanzibar and Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar, the later sultans of Zanzibar. After the death of her husband, Emily Ruete was caught up in the colonial plans of Otto von Bismarck. There were speculations that Bismarck wanted to install her son as Sultan of Zanzibar. She revisited Zanzibar in 1885 and in 1888. Between 1889 and 1914, she lived in Beirut, Lebanon and Jaffa. She died in Jena, Germany, at the age of 79, from severe pneumonia. In 1992, An Arabian Princess Between Two Worlds was published, making her letters home, with her reactions on life in Europe, available to the public. There is a permanent exhibition about Emily Ruete in the People's Palace in Stonetown, the palace constructed by her brother, Sultan Barghash. In fiction Emily Ruete appears as a minor character in M.M. Kaye's novel Trade Wind. The book, set in Zanzibar during the late 1850s, mentions her involvement with her brother Barghash's failed attempt to take the throne from their brother Majid and her subsequent interest in and marriage to Rudolph.

At its source in the Middle Atlas mountains it is known as the Guigou River (Berber: Asif n Gigu). The river is 496 kilometers long and has an average water flow of 137 m3/s, which makes it the largest North African river by volume. It passes near the city of Fes and discharges to the Atlantic Ocean in Mehdia. Sebou is navigable for only 16 km as far as the city of Kenitra, which has the only river port in Morocco. Its most important tributaries are the Ouergha River, Baht River and Inaouen River. The river supports irrigation in Morocco's most fertile region: the Gharb. History Sebou was known in antiquity as Sububus. Pliny the Elder states that it was \\"magnificus et navigabilis\\" (grand and navigable), flowing near the town of Banasa. In 1669-1670, the Alaouite sultan Moulay Rashid built a bridge over the river near Fes which has been preserved today.

WPIT, which signed on the air in 1947, has been a religious station for most of its life, and at one time was a simulcast of its FM sister station up until 1993, when both stations were sold to Salem. WPIT's studios were once located on Smithfield Street in downtown Pittsburgh. A neon sign reading \\"WPIT DIAL 730\\" hung outside their former location for years after they had moved out, well into the early 1980s. The station moved to Gateway Towers in downtown Pittsburgh around 1980, next door to the KDKA and KDKA-TV home of One Gateway Center. WPIT has had only three managers in its long history. Michael Komichak, who also built the station back in 1947 and did much of its engineering work, Chuck Gratner, who assumed control of WPIT-AM and FM after both were sold to Salem in 1993, and then-sales manager Tom Lemmon, who became General Manager following Gratner's retirement in 2014. After Salem's takeover, old policies against atheist guests were lifted and Richard Dawkins has even appeared on air. Once the sale to Salem was complete, the operations of WPIT and its FM sister, WORD-FM moved up to Seven Parkway Center in Greentree, just outside the Pittsburgh city limits. WPIT had added some secular conservative talk programming to its lineup (like Dr. Laura, Michael Medved, and Hugh Hewitt), but religious programming continues to fill most of the station's hours.

The gathering was raided by the Garda S√≠och√°na and Goulding along with John Joe McGirl and ten others was sentenced to twelve months in prison. Upon his release in 1947, Goulding organised IRA training camps in the Wicklow Mountains. He took charge of the IRA's Dublin Brigade in 1951.Hanley and Miller, p. 3 In 1953, he (along with Se√°n Mac St√≠of√°in and Manus Canning) was involved in an arms raid on the Officers' Training Corps armoury at Felsted School in Essex. The three were arrested and sentenced with eight-year prison terms, but were released in 1959 after serving only six years at Pentonville, Wakefield and Stafford prisons.Hanley and Miller, p. 8 In 1956, an attempt was made by the IRA to free Goulding from Wakefield Prison, but this was aborted when alarms were sounded at the prison.The IRA 12th impression, Tim Pat Coogan, pages 346-347, William Collins, Sons & Co., Glasgow, 1987 During his time in Wakefield prison, he befriended EOKA members and Klaus Fuchs, a German-born spy who had passed information about the US nuclear programme to the Soviet Union. In so doing, Goulding became interested in the Russian Revolution.Hanley and Miller, p. 10 Chief of staff He was appointed IRA Quartermaster General in 1959, and in 1962 succeeded Ruair√≠ √ì Br√°daigh as IRA Chief of Staff. In February 1966, together with Se√°n Garland, Goulding was arrested for possession of a revolver and ammunition; in total he spent sixteen years in British and Irish jails. Goulding was instrumental in moving the IRA to the left in the 1960s.J. Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, 1979, Irish Academy PressRobert W. White, Ruairi O Bradaigh: The Life and Politics of An Irish Revolutionary, Indiana University Press, 2006 He argued against the policy of abstentionism and developed a Marxist analysis of Irish politics. He believed the British state deliberately divided the Irish working class on sectarian grounds, in order to exploit them and keep them from uniting and overthrowing their bourgeois oppressors. This analysis was rejected by those who later went on to form the Provisional IRA after the 1969 IRA split. He remained Chief of Staff of what became known as the Official IRA until 1972. Although the Official IRA, like the Provisional IRA, carried out an armed campaign, Goulding argued that such action ultimately divided the Irish working class. After public revulsion at the shooting dead of William Best, a Catholic from Derry who was also a British soldier, and the bombing of the Aldershot barracks, the Official IRA announced a ceasefire in 1972. Goulding was prominent in the various stages of Official Sinn F√©in's development into the Workers' Party of Ireland. He was also involved in the anti-amendment campaign in opposition to the introduction of a constitutional ban on abortion, along with his partner, Dr Moira Woods. In 1992, however, he objected to the political reforms proposed by party leader Proinsias De Rossa, and remained in the Workers' Party after the formation of Democratic Left. He regarded Democratic Left as having compromised socialism in the pursuit of political office.\\"Workers' Party braces itself for another painful schism\\", The Irish Times, 4 January 1992. Last years and death In his later years, Goulding spent much of his time at his cottage in Raheenleigh near Myshall, County Carlow. He died of cancer in his native Dublin, and was survived by three sons and a daughter. He was cremated and his ashes scattered, at his directive, at the site known as \\"the Nine Stones\\" on the slopes of Mount Leinster. ReferencesSources * *T. E.

Gameplay Based on the game system first used in War at Sea, also published by Avalon Hill, the game deals with the Pacific Theater of Operations of World War II. It is a two-player game that can last up to five hours, and each of the 8 turns represents four to six months, except for the 1st turn which covers only December of 1941. Playing pieces typically represent armies, air forces, and capital ships (aircraft carriers, battleships, battlecruisers, heavy cruisers, and light cruisers) of the United States Navy, Royal Navy, Dutch Navy, and Imperial Japanese Navy, and are given numerical ratings for gunnery, armor, speed, and airstrike power. The board divides the Pacific Ocean into 13 sea zones. Each turn players commit their ship, air, and amphibious units to particular zones, and then (if there are opposing forces in the same area) a battle is fought in each zone, until one player retreats or is eliminated. Points of control (POC) are earned based on how many zones a player controls in that turn. Certain areas are worth more to one or both players than others. For example, the Japanese (IJN) player receives 3 POC for controlling Indonesia or the Japanese Islands, but only 1 for controlling the North Pacific. The Allied (USN) player receives only 1 POC for Indonesia, but 3 for the Hawaiian Islands. One of the most basic strategic decisions in the game is which ships to use as \\"patrollers\\" and which to use as \\"raiders\\". Patrollers are deployed first, then land-based air, then amphibious units, and then raiders. So, saving ships for use as raiders allows a player to see a much more developed situation before committing ships, as well as allowing them to travel farther across the map. However, raiding ships do not count for \\"control\\" of an area as patrolling ships (and all land-based air flotillas) do, so some ships usually must be committed early to gain key POC‚Äîor to cut off enemy sea access because on the next turn, enemy ships will not be able to move through a controlled area although they may move into one. Each side receives reinforcements throughout the game approximately coinciding to when the specific ships either became battle-ready in the actual war, or in the case of some Allied ships, were transferred in from the Atlantic theater. The IJN receives most of its ships at the beginning of the game, with only a few reinforcements, while the United States gets multiple additional vessels each turn. At the beginning of Turn 6 the Allied player receives massive US carrier reinforcements which shift the fleet balance dramatically and force the Japanese into a defensive posture. However, in the first 5 turns the IJN's larger fleet usually runs up a large POC advantage which even the USN's newly enlarged fleet may be hard-pressed to overcome in only 3 turns. This is somewhat mitigated because the Allied player (because the USA broke the Japanese code) gets to move second in every phase, e.g. he can wait to see where the Japanese raiders are placed before placing his own raiders, and in battle he can see the results of Japanese attacks before allocating his own fire. This second-move advantage for the Allied is a large advantage for beginners. However, in expert play the Japanese are considered to have the advantage, because with experience players learn to use the threat of the more powerful IJN fleet very aggressively, dictating the Allied moves somewhat and offsetting much of the disadvantage of moving first. If the IJN can force a major battle, his larger fleet can more afford attrition, so Japan can afford to move into dangerous situations and trade ships 1 for 1, often even 2 for 3. Because of this, players usually bid POC for the IJN side to balance the game. Awards Victory in the Pacific won the 1977 Charles S. Roberts Award for Best Strategic Game.

Amorous entanglements lead to a duel and a chase. Collection EYE Film Institute Netherlands. Henry Lehrman (March 30, 1881 ‚Äì November 7, 1946) was an American actor, screenwriter, director and producer. Lehrman was a very prominent figure of Hollywood's silent film era, working with such cinematic pioneers as D. W. Griffith and Mack Sennett. However, he is primarily remembered today not for his own achievements, but for three biographical facts: he directed, as well as co-starred in, Charlie Chaplin's very first film, Making a Living (though Chaplin and he didn't get along); he was notoriously careless of the safety of the actors who worked for him; and he was the lover of the actress Virginia Rappe, for whose death Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle (whom Lehrman had directed in about a dozen films in the early 1920s), in a highly-publicized series of trials, was accused, and later acquitted, of manslaughter. Life and career Born in Sambir, Austria- Hungary (now Ukraine), Lehrman emigrated to the United States in December 1906 and although he is best remembered as a film director, he began his career as an actor in a 1909 Biograph Studios production directed by D. W. Griffith. He gained the nickname \\"Path√©\\", reportedly because he told an executive at Biograph he had been sent there from Europe by France's Path√© Fr√®res to get a job. While the executive may not have believed him, Biograph gave him his first acting work in film, appearing as one of many in a mob scene with another aspiring actor named Mack Sennett. A few years later Lehrman was a successful actor, and made his directorial debut, co-directing a 1911 Biograph production with Sennett. When Sennett left to found Keystone Studios, Henry Lehrman joined him, working as an actor, a screenwriter, and as the first director of Charlie Chaplin. In 1915, Lehrman established his own film company called the L-KO Kompany to make two-reel comedies for Universal Studios. He was notorious for his low regard for actors, such as for Charlie Chaplin in the actor's earliest films, and his willingness to place his actors in dangerous situations earned him the nickname \\"Mr. Suicide\\". Author Kalton C. Lahue noted that bit players and extras actually refused calls from L-KO. In 1916, Lehrman gave up acting to devote himself fully to directing and producing. He left the L-KO Kompany the following year and moved to Fox Film Corporation as producer of its \\"Sunshine Comedies\\" unit. In 1919, he met a young actress named Virginia Rappe and a personal relationship ensued that resulted in their engagement. However, in September 1921, Rappe, 26, died after attending a private party hosted by Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle at a hotel in San Francisco. Arbuckle was accused of raping her and was charged with her murder; Lehrman used the trial for his own personal publicity. Eventually Arbuckle was found not guilty. For the two years following his fianc√©e's death, Lehrman was virtually inactive in the film business. He went through a short-lived marriage in 1922 to Jocelyn Leigh. In 1924 he accepted an offer from Fox Film Corporation to return to directing its \\"Sunshine Comedies\\" unit. Lehrman continued as a successful director until the introduction of talkies at the end of the 1920s. He directed two sound films for Fox in 1929, one a short comedy, the other a feature-length production titled New Year's Eve starring Mary Astor. The films demonstrated Lehrman's difficulty adapting to directing with sound, and he was dropped by Fox. Two years later he made his final attempt at sound films, writing and directing a comedy short for Universal Studios. Lehrman died of a heart attack in Hollywood in 1946, and was interred in the Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery next to Virginia Rappe. He was 65.

Although the horrors of World War II are far removed from the Pacific Coast community where adolescent Duke Cooper (Trevor Morgan) and his three best chums play soldier, experiment with swearing, and earnestly patrol the beach for Japanese submarines, the realities of the war are about to come crashing down around them. Not when a Japanese soldier, stranded and wounded when his sub quickly dived, washes ashore; his capture by the foursome merely allows for more playtime and thoughts of becoming heroes. It's coming because Duke's older brother is on some island awaiting combat and the black sedans with military tags have already begun rolling through town to deliver their grim announcements. And Duke's Japanese American pal Willie Tanaka (Yuki Tokuhiro), all three feet and 55 pounds of him, has suddenly become a threat to national security, so he, his mother, and grandfather are soon to be shipped away to an internment camp.

Background Born in Montreal, Quebec, he is the son of David Libman and Goldie Aronovitch. He attended Herzliah High School, Vanier College, and received a Bachelor of architecture from McGill University in 1985, graduating with Distinction. From 1985 to 1989, he practiced architecture with Jacques Beique et Associ√©s and Tolchinsky and Goodz Architects. Provincial politics In 1988, he co-founded the Equality Party to protest against the Quebec Liberal Party government's decision to extend a ban on English commercial signs. In 1989, he was elected as a Member of the National Assembly in the Montreal riding of D'Arcy-McGee, winning 57.85% of the valid ballots. Due in part to the surprise victory of the Equality Party, the Quebec government later lessened restrictions on English signs. During his term in office, Libman made headlines by using his Parliamentary privilege to reveal the details of confidential, money-losing contracts signed between Hydro- Qu√©bec and some of Quebec's aluminum producers. Libman left the Equality Party and sat as an independent shortly before the 1994 general election. His supporters attempted to make him the Quebec Liberal Party candidate in his riding. However, new Quebec Liberal Party leader Daniel Johnson refused to sign his nomination papers. Libman ran as an independent and lost to the Quebec Liberal Party candidate Lawrence Bergman. After his election defeat, he hosted an evening talk show on Montreal radio station CJAD for three years. He also became the Quebec Regional Director of B'nai Brith Canada. In 1997 Libman won a unanimous Supreme Court of Canada judgement in Libman v Quebec (AG). Certain sections of the Quebec Referendum Law, concerning restrictions on third party spending, were struck down. As a result of this decision, the charges against federalist groups who participated in the large Pro-Canada Rally during the 1995 referendum campaign were cancelled. In 1995 Libman authored Riding the Rapids; The Whitewater Rise and Fall of Quebec's Anglo Protest published by Robert Davies Publishing. Mayor of C√¥te Saint-Luc In 1998, Libman was acclaimed mayor of the city of C√¥te Saint-Luc, Quebec. In 2001, he was elected borough mayor of C√¥te Saint-Luc‚ÄîHampstead‚ÄîMontreal West and was a member of the Montreal City Council and its Executive Committee. He was responsible for the Urban Planning and Development portfolio and was charged with overseeing the creation of Montreal's new Urban Master Plan which was adopted by City Council in 2004. Libman supported the continued merger of the borough of C√¥te Saint-Luc with the megacity of Montreal after the provincial government watered down their promise of allowing the former cities to return to the same status as they had before the merger. He decided to quit politics in 2005, and not to run for mayor of the re-constituted city of C√¥te Saint-Luc following its demerger from the megacity of Montreal. He returned to private life and opened his own architectural consulting firm, Libcorp Consultants Inc. He was also a director and partner in RSW Properties, a property management firm in Montreal until 2015. Later that year he joined Olymbec, a large real estate developer as their in-house consultant on architecture, planning and municipal zoning. Move to federal politics Libman returned to politics in 2014 by seeking the Conservative Party of Canada nomination in Mount Royal for the 2015 federal election. Libman won the nomination on April 26, beating former TVA journalist, Pascale D√©ry. On October 19, 2015, Libman was defeated by Liberal Anthony Housefather.

It draws its name from the qulliq (kudlik), an Inuit oil lamp. The company uses name Nunavut Power as a trading name for power generation. It is headquartered in Baker Lake, Nunavut. History Qulliq Energy was established by the Nunavut Power Utilities Act (now the Qulliq Energy Corporation Act) in 2001, two years after the 1999 creation of Canada's Nunavut Territory, to take over the assets within Nunavut of the Northwest Territories Power Corporation. Its original name was Nunavut Power Corporation and it was renamed Qulliq Energy Corporation in 2002 and the mandate of the corporation expanded to include energy conservation and alternative generation development. The power generation trading name Nunavut Power was adopted in 2003. Qulliq Energy established Nunavut Energy Centre in 2006 as a division focusing on energy conservation through public outreach. The centre was closed down on March 31, 2009, and its functions were transferred to the territorial government departments. Operations Low population, severe weather and remoteness of transportation and construction technology make long distance high voltage grids unviable. Every community in Nunavut relies on independent diesel generators, fueled by the annual sealift re-supply during the summer shipping season. This dependence on diesel presents its own set of environmental and economic impacts, leaving the territory vulnerable to world energy price fluctuations. The first new power generation facility since establishment of the company will be expansion of the Iqaluit power plant. The geography of Nunavut presents unique challenges to hydro-electric facilities, but the company is actively engaged in site reviews for hydro-electric developments in the 12-20 MW range around Iqaluit, the territorial capital. The hydro-electric plants are planned in Jaynes Inlet and Armshow South on the south shore of Frobisher Bay. During the 1970s, there had been suggestions of NCPC employing \\"slowpoke\\" nuclear generators to produce power in the many isolated communities. Since the establishment, periodic discussions continue regarding the possibility of combining Nunavut's fuel delivery functions under Qulliq Energy. =Iqaluit Hydroelectric Project= In 2005, Quilliq Energy initiated a study of potential sites near Iqaluit for the development of a hydroelectric power station. Two sites, Jaynes Inlet and Armshow South, were selected as the most cost effective and viable solutions after comprehensive research. The Jaynes Inlet site () would be the site of a 12.5 MW hydroelectric dam that is expected to meet Iqaluit's current energy demand. The Armshow South site () would be the site of a 7.3 MW hydroelectric dam that would be developed when additional capacity is needed. However, Quilliq Energy does not have an adequate revenue surplus or borrowing ability in order to fund the project on its own, especially as 13 of the 25 diesel-fired power stations across the territory are in need of replacement. As a result, the hydroelectric project was shelved in 2014. Controversies In 2010 and 2011, five lawsuits were filed against Qulliq Energy by former employees for wrongful/constructive dismissal, while some other former workers accused the company for the violation of Inuit rights in the workplace.

Owned by the Salem Media Group, the station broadcasts on 101.5 MHz, with an ERP of 48 kW. Its transmitter is located in Reserve Township, Pennsylvania. History In Pittsburgh, WORD-FM was originally on the 104.7 frequency (now WPGB-FM). Salem Communications, which had formed in the early 1980s by Christian broadcasters Ed Atsinger and Stuart W. Epperson, had first made overtures to purchase WPIT AM/FM from Associated Communications back in the mid-80's, but the station had been sold to Boston-based Pyramid Broadcasting, which operated WPIT AM/FM under the name Kiss Limited Partnership, for a much higher price than what Salem was willing to pay. Still recognizing the profit potential for Christian-formatted radio in Pittsburgh despite a competitor, Salem entered into an agreement with Pittsburgh-based Gateway Broadcasting Enterprises, which owned WYDD-FM (now WPGB) and WKPA-AM (now WMNY), both operating out of New Kensington, a suburb of Pittsburgh. The deal was signed in 1987, but due to legal complexities between the two companies, it would not be until January 1990 that the deal between Salem and Gateway was consummated. Salem still had yet to obtain the contracts for the ministries that would provide the programming for the station. By the time of their takeover, WYDD had become Top 40 rocker WNRJ, which stayed around for about a year. Upon Salem's acquisition, WNRJ's format was immediately changed to beautiful music provided by Salt Lake City-based Bonneville Broadcasting and its airstaff laid off. The call letters were changed to WEZE-FM (the same calls as Salem's co- owned AM in Boston) and the station adopted the moniker \\"Easy 104.7\\". WKPA, which operated independently of its FM sister since 1940, had its weekday programming substituted with a simulcast of WEZE-FM, but kept existing separate specialty programming on the weekends. In August 1991, Salem announced that WEZE-FM would change to the heritage Christian-formatted radio formula that had become the staple of its other high-powered FM stations. Salem purchased the WORD call letters, which belonged to an AM station in Spartansburg, South Carolina, for $20,000. The format change took place in October, and 104.7 became WORD-FM. =Salem acquires WPIT AM/FM= In 1992, after a lengthy series of negotiations, the opportunity presented itself again for Salem to acquire WPIT AM/FM. New FCC rules governing ownership allowed Salem to hold more than two licenses simultaneously, and a deal was made for Salem to buy out its former rival and spin their existing stations off to new owners. WKPA was spun off to Pentecostal Temple Development Corporation in November 1992 as a gift. PTDC was the business arm of Pentecostal Temple Church of God, pastored by former WPXI-TV reporter Dr. D. Loran Mann. WORD-FM 104.7 was also sold off to Entercom, Inc., which operated country music competitor WDSY-FM, and had been looking for an FM station for a duopoly property. =WORD-FM merger with WPIT= The transaction took place in January 1993, and WORD-FM moved its current call letters and format to 101.5, which had been the FM partial simulcast of WPIT. Some of WPIT-FM's existing programming elements were retained, but much of the programming mirrored WORD- FM's original format that began on 104.7. 104.7 then came under the control of Entercom in an LMA (local marketing agreement) deal with Salem until it was purchased outright six months later. The new 104.7 was assigned the call letters WXRB and adopted the moniker \\"Rebel 104.7 Hit Country\\" after stunting for a brief period with a Classic Rock format and the name \\"U.S. 104.7\\". WPIT, which had been running all ministry-based conservative programming all day, then began to run Contemporary Christian music during the afternoon and evening hours to appease listeners who had grown accustomed to hearing CCM on WPIT-FM prior to the ownership change. =WORD-FM today= WPIT, which for years had been co-located with WPIT-FM at Gateway Towers in downtown Pittsburgh, joined the new WORD-FM at its home at Seven Parkway Center in Greentree, located just off I-279 south of the Fort Pitt Tunnells. WORD-FM still maintains the ministries as the mainstay of its programming, but has in recent years added CCM music back into its programming. Unlike many other major market radio stations, WORD-FM has a stable, secure staff, some of whom have been with the station since its format switch from beautiful music to Christian Talk. General Manager Chuck Gratner (also known in the 1960s and 1970s as West Coast DJ legend Chuck Roy) managed WORD-FM from its start-up until his retirement in 2014. Former WORD-FM sales manager Tom Lemmon was appointed to succeed Gratner. Kenny Woods, formerly mid-days at crosstown oldies WWSW, has been at the station since 2001. Weekend music On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), WORD-FM plays Christian music during the early morning, afternoon, and evening on Saturdays, and during the early morning and afternoon on Sundays. Kenny Woods is the dj during the afternoon and Chris Reynolds hosts the Pop Top 20 Countdown Saturdays from 6pm to 8pm.

Nanoelectrochemistry plays significant role in the fabrication of various sensors, and devices for detecting molecules at very low concentrations.  Mechanism Two transport mechanisms are fundamental for nanoelectrochemistry: electron transfer and mass transport. The formulation of theoretical models allows to understand the role of the different species involved in the electrochemical reactions. The electron transfer between the reactant and the nanoelectrode can be explained by the combination of various theories based on the Marcus theory. Mass transport, that is the diffusion of the reactant molecules from the electrolyte bulk to the nanoelectrode, is influenced by the formation of a double electric layer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. At the nanoscale it is necessary to theorize a dynamic double electric layer which takes into account an overlap of the Stern layer and the diffuse layer. Knowledge of the mechanisms involved allows to build computational models that combine the density functional theory with electron transfer theories and the dynamic double electric layer. In the field of molecular modelling, accurate models could predict the behaviour of the system as reactants, electrolyte or electrode change. = Interface effect = The role of the surface is strongly reaction-specific: in fact, one site can catalyze certain reactions and inhibit other ones. According to TSK model, surface atoms in nanocrystals can occupy terrace, step or kink positions: each site has a different tendency to adsorb reactants and to let them move along the surface. Generally, sites having lower coordination number (steps and kinks) are more reactive due to their high free energy. High energy sites, however, are less thermodynamically stable and nanocrystals have a tendency to transform to their equilibrium shape. Thanks to the progress in nanoparticles synthesis it is now possible to have a single-crystal approach to surface science, allowing more precise research on the effect of a given surface. Studies have been conducted on nanoelectrodes exposing a (100), (110) or (111) plane to a solution containing the reactants, in order to define the surface effect on reaction rate and selectivity of the most common electrochemical reactions.  Nanoelectrodes  Nanoelectrodes are tiny electrodes made of metals or semiconducting materials having typical dimensions of 1-100 nm. Various forms of nanoelectrodes have been developed taking advantage of the different possible fabrication techniques: among the most studied are the nanoband, disk, hemispherical, nanopore geometries as well as the different forms of carbon nanostructures. It is necessary to characterize each produced electrode: size and shape determine its behaviour. The most used characterization techniques are: * Electron microscopy * Steady-state voltammetry * Atomic force microscopy (AFM) * scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) There are mainly two properties that distinguish nanoelectrodes from electrodes: smaller RC constant and faster mass transfer. The former allows measurements to be made in high-resistance solutions because they offer less resistance, the latter, due to radial diffusion, allows much faster voltammetry responses. Due to these and other properties, nanoelectrodes are used in various applications: * Studying the kinetics of fast reactions * Electrochemical reactions * Studying small volumes, such as cells or single molecules * As probes for obtaining high- resolution images with scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) References External links  * Electrochemical characterisation of atomic layers and multilayers Category:Nanoelectronics Category:Electrochemistry ","title":"Nanoelectrochemistry"},{"id":"2740215","text":"Winslow Homer, Snap the Whip (1872).

The entire \\"tail\\" of the whip moves in those directions but with much more force toward the end of the tail. The longer the tail, the more the forces act on the last player and the tighter they have to hold on. As the game progresses and more players fall off, some of those who were previously located near the end of the tail and have fallen off can \\"move up\\" and be in a more secure position by grabbing onto the tail as it is moving, provided they can get back on before others do. There is no objective to this game other than enjoying the experience. The game is also illustrated in Winslow Homer's painting Snap the Whip of 1872.

Clamaran was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine. In the early 1990s, his local fame interested Maximum FM, the leading parisian dance radio station at that time. Impressed by his mixing gift, Clamaran gained a huge audience and started to be booked for one off parties.IMO Records. ‚ÄúAntoine Clamaran Biography\\", IMO Records, London, Retrieved on 25 January 2012. But Palace headquarters asked him to run the mythical Gay Tea Dance every Sunday, instead of French icon Laurent Garnier. Biography In 1992 Clamaran, eager to get involved into production, teamed up with Laurent Pautrat. Their first Production \\"I've got music in me\\" by 400 Hz made him one of the most promising French producers. Released on House Trade Records, this track was licensed by BMG France and sold over 100,000 units. Then record companies started to flood Clamaran with remixing requests such as : \\"Funky Music\\" by Calvin Stone, \\"oxygene\\" by Jean Michel Jarre, \\"party time\\" by Gloria Estefan, \\"you spin me round\\" by Dead or Alive and \\"Encore Une Fois\\" by Euro smash. His own productions under the names of Carayca, 400 Hz, D-Plac, LAC, Unchain & House Train were always at the top the DJ playlists but it was not until 1998 was he again to enter the French top 50 best-sellers list. As a DJ he switched his residency from Palace to the Temple of Dance in Paris: Le Queen. During 1998 he produced 3 club smashes under the name Omega: \\"Dreaming Of A Better World\\", \\"Peace & Harmony\\", \\"The Mission\\". All these tracks went gold status in France (250,000 units) but didn't make any sales abroad. By 1999, Clamaran had reached a blockbuster status in France but he chose to come back to house music, leaving behind the commercial path laid out for him. He decided to produce tracks under his own name and oriented for the international markets. His first productions under his name; \\"Do The Funk\\", \\"Get Up\\" and \\"After\\", were written with the now famous \\"french filtered sound\\". These tracks were licensed by US based label Filtered records and released on the Discoland EP. The record became a \\"must have\\" for most of the world's key DJs including Boris Duglosch, Erick Morillo, Pete Tong, Danny Rampling and Robbie Rivera. With \\"We Come To Party\\" feat. Blue James (Basement jaxx singer), the filtered disco style of Clamaran, became an asset for the house community. In 1999, a few days before New Year's Eve, Clap production (Clamaran /Pautrat label) merged into Penso Positivo (firm of another famous DJ in France : Claude Monnet). Antoine is now managing 4 labels, as producer and a&r;, within Penso Possitivo: Academy, North Club, House Trade Records and Basic traxx. In 2000, he achieved charts success with Vibration INC. Antoine Clamaran is currently the resident in the two biggest parisian clubs: Les Bains Douches and Le Queen. The leading single from his 2009 album Spotlight, \\"Gold\\", reached #5 position in Russia and topped the Moscow Airplay Chart.\\"Gold\\" track positions at tophit.ru Now, Antoine works with Soraya Arnelas for her new album.

Played on a mapboard depicting the northern coastline of eastern Libya and western Egypt, the game follows Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps and their Italian allies as they fought back-and-forth campaigns against British forces in World War II. The game uses small cardboard counters and the then newly popular hex-based movement system pioneered by Avalon Hill's D-Day in 1961. The mapboard's hexes represent terrain roughly ten to fifteen kilometers (six to nine miles) across, and the military units, represented by the cardboard counters, vary from regiment up to division size. The game's system emphasizes the importance of supply, particularly the variability of Afrika Korps' supply and reinforcements. Unlike other similar wargames published by Avalon Hill around the same time, units could not attack at will, but used up supply counters (which were very limited in number) to attack.

He was a leader of the movement to have Lebanon become an independent country, a goal which was achieved by 1943.

The genus name Stylidium is derived from the Greek œÉœÑœçŒªŒøœÇ or stylos (column or pillar), which refers to the distinctive reproductive structure that its flowers possess.Curtis's Botanical Magazine. (1832). Stylidium scandens, Volume 59: Plate 3136. Pollination is achieved through the use of the sensitive \\"trigger\\", which comprises the male and female reproductive organs fused into a floral column that snaps forward quickly in response to touch, harmlessly covering the insect in pollen. Most of the approximately 300 species are only found in Australia, making it the fifth largest genus in that country. Triggerplants are considered to be protocarnivorous or carnivorous because the glandular trichomes that cover the scape and flower can trap, kill, and digest small insects with protease enzymes produced by the plant. Recent research has raised questions as to the status of protocarnivory within Stylidium.  Characteristics  S. turbinatum flowers untriggered (left) and after being triggered (right). The floral column will reset to the original position. The majority of the Stylidium species are perennial herbs of which some are geophytes that utilize bulbs as their storage organ. The remaining small group of species consists of ephemeral annuals.Good, R. (1925). On the Geographical Distribution of the Stylidiaceae. New Phytologist, 24(4): 225-240. Members of the genus are most easily identified by their unique floral column, in which the stamen and style are fused. The column--also commonly called a \\"trigger\\" in this genus--typically resides beneath the plane of the flower. Stylidium flowers are zygomorphic, which means they are only symmetrical in one plane.Laurent, N., Bremer, B., Bremer, K. (1998). Phylogeny and Generic Interrelationships of the Stylidiaceae (Asterales), with a Possible Extreme Case of Floral Paedomorphosis. Systematic Botany, 23(3): 289-304. Flowers usually bloom in the late spring in Australia.Erickson, Rica. (1961). An introduction to triggerplants. Australian Plants, 1(9): 15-17. (Available online: HTML) = Morphology = Stylidium debile flower, resetting after being triggered. Species of the genus Stylidium represent a very diverse selection of plants. Some are only a few centimeters tall, while others can grow to be tall (S. laricifolium). One typical plant form is a dense rosette of leaves close to the ground that gives rise to the floral spike in the center. Plant forms range from wiry, creeping mats (S. scandens) to the bushy S. laricifolium.Darnowski, Douglas W. (2002). Triggerplants. Australia: Rosenberg Publishing. Flower morphology differs in details, but ascribes to a simple blueprint: four petals, zygomorphic in nature, with the trigger protruding from the \\"throat\\" of the flower and resting below the plane of the flower petals. Flower size ranges from many species that have small wide flowers to the wide flowers of S. schoenoides. Flower color can also vary from species to species, but most include some combination of white, cream, yellow, or pink. Flowers are usually arranged in a spike or dense raceme, but there is at least one exception to the rule: S. uniflorum, as its name suggests, produces a single flower per inflorescence. Leaf morphology is also very diverse in this large genus. Some leaves are very thin, almost needle-like (S. affine), while others are short, stubby, and arranged in rosettes (S. pulviniforme). Another group of species, such as S. scandens (climbing triggerplant) form scrambling, tangled mats typically propped up on aerial roots. = Pollination mechanism = Stylidium turbinatum flower, showing the reproductive column. A beefly in Western Australia pollinating Stylidium The column typical of the genus Stylidium is sensitive and responds to touch. The change in pressure when a pollinating insect lands on a Stylidium flower causes a physiological change in the column turgor pressure by way of an action potential, sending the column quickly flying toward the insect.Findlay, G.P. and Pallaghy, C.K. (1978). Potassium chloride in the motor tissue of Stylidium. Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 5(2): 219 - 229. (Abstract available online: HTML) Upon impact, the insect will be covered in pollen and stunned, but not harmed. Because the column comprises the fused male and female reproductive organs of the flower, the stamen and stigma take turns in dominating the function of the column--the anthers develop first and then are pushed aside by the developing stigma. This delayed development of the stigma prevents self-pollination and ensures that cross pollination will occur between individuals of a population. Different species have evolved the trigger mechanism in different locations, with some attacking the pollinating insect from above and others from below (a \\"punch in the gut\\" to the insect).Armbruster, W.S., Edwards, M.E., Debevec, E.M. (1994). Floral Character Displacement Generates Assemblage Structure of Western Australian Triggerplants (Stylidium). Ecology, 75(2): 315-329. The response to touch is very quick in Stylidium species. The column can complete its \\"attack\\" on the insect in as little as 15 milliseconds. After firing, the column resets to its original position in anywhere from a few minutes to a half hour, depending on temperature and species-specific qualities. The column is able to fire many times before it no longer responds to stimuli. The response time is highly dependent upon ambient temperature, with lower temperatures relating to slower movement.Findlay, G.P. (1978) Movement of the Column of Stylidium crassifolium as a Function of Temperature. Australian Journal of Plant Physiology, 5(4): 477-484. Stylidium species are typically pollinated by small solitary bees and the nectar-feeding bee flies (Bombyliidae).Armbruster, W. S., and N. Muchhala. 2009. Associations between floral specialization and species diversity: cause, effect, or correlation? Evolutionary Ecology, 23: 159-179. = Carnivory = S. fimbriatum displaying the trichomes that can trap and kill insects. Stylidium species with glandular trichomes on their sepals, leaves, flower parts, or scapes have been suggested to be protocarnivorous (or paracarnivorous). The tip of the trichome produces a sticky mucilage‚Äîa mixture of sugar polymers and water‚Äîthat is capable of attracting and suffocating small insects. The ability to trap insects may be a defensive mechanism against damage to flower parts. However, trichomes of S. fimbriatum have been shown to produce digestive enzymes, specifically proteases, like other carnivorous plants. Adding species of Stylidium to the list of plants that engage in carnivory would significantly increase the total number of known carnivorous plants.Darnowski, D.W., Carroll, D.M., P≈Çachno, B., Kabanoff, E., and Cinnamon, E. (2006). Evidence of protocarnivory in triggerplants (Stylidium spp.; Stylidiaceae). Plant Biology, 8(6): 805-812. The insects captured by the glandular trichomes are too small to serve any role in pollination. It is unclear, however, whether these plants evolved the ability to trap and kill insects as an adaptation to low environmental nutrient availability or simply a defensive mechanism against insects damaging flower parts. There is also a correlation between location of Stylidium species and proximity of known carnivorous species, like sundews (Drosera), bladderworts (Utricularia), the Albany pitcher plant (Cephalotus follicularis), and the rainbow plant (Byblis). While this alone does not prove that Stylidium species are themselves carnivorous, the hypothesis is that the association arose because Stylidium species and the known carnivorous plants obtain scarce nutrients using the same source, namely captured insects. Preliminary proof is given that the trapping mechanisms of two associated plants are the same (the tentacles of Byblis and Drosera), though this may be only a coincidence and further research must be done. Recent research has raised questions as to the status of protocarnivory within Stylidium. = Distribution and habitat = Typical habitat for some Stylidium near a granite outcrop in Western Australia Most Stylidium species are endemic to Australia. In Western Australia alone, there are more than 150 species, at least 50 of which are in the area immediately around Perth. There are at least four species of Stylidium that are not confined to the Australian continent: S. tenellum is found in Myanmar, Melaka, and Tonkin; S. kunthii in Bengal and Myanmar; S. uliginosum in Queensland, Sri Lanka, and the south coast of China; and S. alsinoides in Queensland and the Philippines. The cladistic group Stylidium contains more than 230 individual species (more than 300 species exist, but many specimens have not yet been formally described),Information from an October 26, 2004 edition of \\"Talking Plants\\" , a program of the Botanic Gardens Trust, a division of the New South Wales Department of Environment and Conservation making it the fifth largest genus in Australia. Stylidium habitat includes grassy plains, open heaths, rocky slopes, sandplains, forests, and the margins of creeks and water holes. Somes species, such as S. eglandulosum, can even be found in disturbed areas like near roads and under powerlines. Others (i.e. S. coroniforme) are sensitive to disturbance and are considered rare because of their extremely specific habitat. Even though many species of Stylidium may coexist in the same location, natural hybrids between species have not often been reported. Both natural hybridisation in the field and artificial hybridisation in cultivation are rare. The first natural hybrid, S. petiolare √ó S. pulchellum, was reported by Sherwin Carlquist in 1969 between Capel and Boyanup in Western Australia.Carlquist, S.J. (1969). Studies in Stylidiaceae: New taxa, field observations, evolutionary tendencies. Aliso, 7: 13-64.  Botanical history  S. violaceum from Ferdinand Bauer's 1813 Illustrationes Florae Novae Hollandiae. S. turbinatum in cultivation. Discovery and description of new Stylidium species has been occurring since the late 18th century, the first of which was discovered in Botany Bay in 1770 by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander during their travels in the Pacific with James Cook aboard the Endeavour. Seven species were collected by Banks and Solander, some of which were sketched by Sydney Parkinson on board the Endeavour and were later engraved in preparation for publication in Banks' Florilegium. Later, in the early 19th century, the French botanist Charles Fran√ßois Antoine Morren wrote one of the first descriptions of the triggerplant anatomy, illustrated by many botanical artists including Ferdinand Bauer. Around the same time, British botanist Robert Brown described (or \\"authored\\") several Stylidium species, including S. adnatum and S. repens. More species began to be described as more botanists explored Australia more thoroughly. In 1958, Rica Erickson wrote Triggerplants, describing habitat, distribution, and plant forms (ephemeral, creeping, leafy-stemmed, rosette, tufted, scale-leaved, and tropical). It was Erickson that began placing certain species into these morphologically-based groups, which may or may not resemble true taxonomic divergences. It was not until the 1970s and 1980s that research of the trigger physiology was begun in the lab of Dr. Findlay of Flinders University. Douglas Darnowski added to the growing library of knowledge on Stylidium when he published his book Triggerplants in 2002, describing an overview of habitat, plant morphology, carnivory, and research done to date. Following its publication, he co-founded the International Triggerplant Society.Darnowski, Douglas W. (2002). The history of triggerplants. International Triggerplant Society. (Archived, available online: HTML) As of 2002, only 221 Stylidium species were known.Wagstaff, S.J. and Wege, J. (2002). Patterns of diversification in New Zealand Stylidiaceae. American Journal of Botany, 89(5): 865-874. (Available online: HTML or PDF versions) There are now over 300 species, many of which are awaiting formal description.  Cultivation  Stylidium graminifolium is available in cultivation with two cultivars: 'Tiny Trina' and 'Little Sapphire'. Most Stylidium species tend to be hardy species and can be easily cultivated in greenhouses or gardens. They are drought resistant, hardy to cold weather, and the species diversity in this genus gives gardeners a wide variety of choices. Most species that are native to Western Australia will be cold hardy to at least -1 to -2 ¬∞C. The few that can be found all over Australia, like S. graminifolium, will tolerate a wider range of habitat since their native ranges includes a great diversity of ecoregions. Some species of triggerplants are suitable for cultivation outdoors outside of the Australian continent including most of the United Kingdom and as far north as New York City or Seattle in the United States. Cultivation from seed may be difficult or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. They appear to be sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.

He lived in the area of Andhra Pradesh in South India. He composed a number of padams and keertanas, the prevalent formats of his time. He is credited with more than 4000 compositions, although only a handful have survived. He composed his songs on his favourite deity Krishna (Gopala) in Telugu. Not much is known about his personal life. He was born in a village called Movva (or Muvva), Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh. His parents named him Varadayya. Because of his habit of traveling from one place to another singing his songs at temples, he came to be called Kshetragna or Kshetrayya (one who travels). He perfected the padam format that is still used today. His padams are sung in dance (Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi) and music recitals. A unique feature of his padams is the practice of singing the anupallavi first then the pallavi (second verse followed by first verse). Most of the padams are of the theme of longing for the coming of the Lord Krishna. He wrote with Sringara as a main theme in expressing madhurabhakti (devotion to the supreme). Sringara is a motif where the mundane sexual relationship between a Nayaki (woman) and a Nayaka (man) is used as a metaphor, denoting the yearning of jeeva (usually depicted as the Nayaki) to unite with the divine (usually depicted as the man). In most of his compositions, Kshetrayya has used the mudra (signature) \\"Muvva Gopala\\" as a reference to himself, which is also a name for the Lord Krishna in Kshetrayya's village Muvva in Krishna District of Andhra Pradesh State, now called as Movva. Kshetrayya's work has played a major role in influencing poetry, dance, music of the South Indian tradition. Kshetrayya was intimately connected with the devadasi women of the temples of south India, who were the subject of many of his compositions. The devadasis traditionally possessed the musical/poetic interpretations of his work for a long period till the devadasi system was abolished and the compositions became more accepted in the musical community as valuable works of art. The musical community owes a lot to Veena Dhanammal and T. Brinda, who popularized Kshetrayya's songs with their beautiful musical interpretation. Kshetrayya's padams now form an integral part of the dance and musical traditions of South India, where his songs are rendered purely as musical works or as accompaniments to dance. Telugu film Mahakavi Kshetrayya is a 1976 Telugu film produced by Anjali Pictures and starring Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Anjali Devi. The film's soundtrack was sung by V. Ramakrishna and composed by P. Adinarayana Rao. Biographic novel The life of Kshetragna is depicted in the novel Bliss Of Life by M. V. Rama Sarma, professor of English and former vice chancellor, S.V. University, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is translated into Telugu with the title Kshetrayya. References * Prof. M. V.

The paper is owned by Advance Publications, and was a daily newspaper from its founding through September 30, 2012. After that day, the News and its two sister Alabama newspapers, the Press-Register in Mobile and The Huntsville Times, moved to a thrice-weekly print-edition publication schedule (Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays). The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, also an Advance newspaper, also went to thrice-weekly on the same day.  History  The Birmingham News was launched on March 14, 1888, by Rufus N. Rhodes as The Evening News, a four-page paper with two reporters and $800 of operating capital. At the time, the city of Birmingham was only 17 years old, but was an already booming industrial city and a beacon of the \\"New South\\" still recovering from the aftermath of the American Civil War and Reconstruction. Newspapers joined with industrial tycoons, academics and real-estate speculators in relentless boosterism of the new city. Prior to starting the paper, Rhodes worked as editor of the city's Daily Herald. However, he and the publisher had a falling out over a proposed public works project. Rhodes supported construction of a viaduct across \\"Railroad Reservation\\" dividing north and south Birmingham. The Heralds publisher opposed the project. The dispute ended with Rhodes leaving to launch the News with the slogan \\"Great is Birmingham and The News is its Prophet!\\" The \\"News Bridge\\" (21st Street Viaduct) was dedicated on July 4, 1891, which Rhodes' paper hailed as the \\"grandest of all municipal achievements of great and glorious Birmingham.\\" The News circulation grew from 628 in 1888 to more than 7,000 in 1891, when it became the largest daily in Alabama and won the contract to publish the General Laws of Alabama. The name changed first to The Evening News, then The Daily News, and, in 1895, The Birmingham News. The newspaper continued to grow, reaching a circulation of 17,000 in 1909. Staunchly progressive in its political stance, the News supported a straight-ticket Democrat platform in election seasons and championed progressive causes such as prohibition. The News led the drumbeat for the \\"Greater Birmingham\\" movement to annex suburban communities. The successful campaign caused the population of the City of Birmingham to grow from 40,000 in 1900 to 138,685 in 1910, at which time Birmingham was the third largest city in the South. That same year, Rhodes died and was succeeded by his vice-president and general manager, Victor H. Hanson (1876‚Äì1945). Hanson, only 33 years old, was already an accomplished newspaperman, having at age 11 founded the City Item in Macon, Georgia, which he sold four years later for $2,500. Hanson helped modernize the newspaper's format, tone and operations and oversaw an increase in subscriptions from 18,000 in 1910 to 40,000 in 1914, when he boldly claimed the title of \\"The South's Greatest Newspaper\\". In 1912, the evening paper launched a Sunday edition in direct competition with the morning Age-Herald. By 1920, the News dominated the lucrative Sunday market. Its edition had a circulation of 48,055, compared to 29,795 for the Age-Herald. The 1917 Birmingham News building, vacated in 2006 and demolished in 2008 In 1917 the News moved to a new six-story Jacobean-style office building on the corner of 4th Avenue North and 22nd Street. At the time of the move, the News published this opinion: \\"The News is proud of its new home and believes it to be the handsomest and best equipped in the entire South. Publishers from other cities have been kind enough to say that nowhere in the land was there a more adequate, convenient and efficient newspaper plant. Many thousands of dollars have been expended with that end in view.\\" =Acquisitions= A year later the paper made good use of its new space by purchasing the rival Birmingham Ledger, increasing the size of its staff to 748 and its circulation to 60,000. In 1927 the Birmingham Age-Herald was sold to Hanson, who continued publishing both papers. In 1950 Scripps-Howard, which already owned the Birmingham Post, bought the Age-Herald but entered into a joint-operating agreement that moved the new Birmingham Post-Herald into the Birmingham News building. The News press printed both papers and handled advertising and subscriptions sales while the editorial and reporting staffs remained independent. The agreement lasted until the Post- Herald ceased publication in September 2005, leaving the News as Birmingham's only daily newspaper. =Sale= In 1956, the Hanson family sold the News to S. I. Newhouse Sr.'s Advance Publications in New York for $18 million, the largest sum that had been paid at the time for a daily newspaper. The privately held Advance continues to own the News as well as The Huntsville Times and Mobile's Press-Register, the three largest newspapers in Alabama, as well as their shared website, al.com. In 1997, the News Company switched the morning and evening publications, making the News the morning paper and the Post-Herald the evening paper. This move reinforced the News's preeminent role as morning papers were the norm. Building built for The Birmingham News in 2006, but put on the market and vacated by The News in 2014 after Alabama Media Group could no longer afford the building. On August 10, 2006 the News cut the ribbon on their new headquarters building across 4th Avenue from their 1917 plant. The $25 million, 4-story, brick and limestone building, designed by Williams-Blackstock Architects, borrows several details from the older building and is dramatically bisected by a glass atrium. The 1917 building was demolished in 2008 in order to make room for a surface parking lot serving employees of the paper. The lot is between the new office building and the facility that houses The Birmingham News presses. On January 22, 2013, Alabama Media Group announced it was selling the building, saying the high-tech, modern and open facility was not conducive to its digital-first, print-last operations. In 2009, Advance Publications' three Alabama newspapers were organized into the Advance Alabama Group, headed by Ricky Mathews, publisher of the Mobile newspaper. Although Advance had owned the News since 1956, the Hanson family continued to run the business until December 1, 2009, when Victor H. Hanson III (1956‚Äì), retired at the age of 52. Hanson was replaced by Pam Siddall, previously the publisher of The Wichita Eagle and The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer. In 2011, the News acquired Birmingham magazine from the Birmingham Business Alliance. The Birmingham News maintained bureaus in Montgomery and Washington, D.C. The Washington bureau was closed in September 2012 when the owners decided coverage of Alabama interests in Washington was neither local nor important to its customers. The Birmingham News moved out of its 2006 building in 2014, after its owners cut back publication and could no longer afford to occupy the large building. The News moved into a renovated old warehouse a few blocks away, with the 2006 building on the market. In 2015, Infinity Property & Casualty Corp. purchased the old News building for $20 million. =Statistics and facts= The Birmingham News in 1888 cost on average $5 a year and 25 cents for three months, compared to 2013, when it costs $35 for thirteen weeks. Between 1888 and 1895 it jumped from just 18,000 subscribers to 40,000. This leap was due to not only a booming city, but also a rise in literacy rates and a middle class that was growing with increasing numbers of blue-collar jobs with increasing development of resources such as coal and cotton. =Print-edition cutbacks= On May 24, 2012, Advance Publications announced that its three Alabama newspapers would do away with print editions on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The move was a result of the continuing decline in advertising revenue and circulation for its traditional print products. The move places increased emphasis on their website, al.com, and reorganizes the Alabama properties into two companies: Alabama Media Group, the editorial and advertising side; and Advance Central Services Alabama, which handles production, distribution and back-office services. The changes took effect on October 1, 2012, making Birmingham the second-largest city in the United States to not be served by a daily newspaper; New Orleans became the largest that same day. New Orleans lost that dubious distinction when Baton Rouge's daily newspaper, The Advocate, began publication of a daily edition in New Orleans; further, on June 24, 2013, The Times-Picayune resumed daily publication with a tabloid edition called \\"TP Street\\" sold only through newsstands and retailers. With those two moves, Birmingham became the largest city in the country without its own daily newspaper. =Editorial stance= According to the paper in 2017, when offering a political endorsement, it generally skews toward the Republican Party with a few exceptions. The paper endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election, and on November 18, 2017, it endorsed Democrat Doug Jones in the 2017 U.S. Senate special election in Alabama. Honors Former Birmingham News reporter Victor Gold was in 1964 an aide to U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater and subsequently the press secretary to Vice President, Spiro T. Agnew. He was also affiliated with President George Herbert Walker Bush.Victor Gold profile, June 29, 2007, Bill Moyers Journal website. In 1991, Ron Casey, Harold Jackson and Joey Kennedy received a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for their editorial campaign analyzing inequities in Alabama's tax system and proposing needed reforms. In 2006, staff photographer Bernard Troncale took top honors at the Society of Professional Journalists' Green Eyeshade Awards for his work on a series about AIDS in Africa. In 2006 the News editorial staff were finalists for another Pulitzer for Editorial Writing for a series of editorials reversing the paper's longstanding support of the death penalty. That same year the paper won two Awards of Excellence from the Society for News Design for the paper's overall graphic layout. In 2007, reporter Brett Blackledge won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for his series of articles exposing corruption in Alabama's two-year college system. In 2018, columnist John Archibald won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for his columns about former governor Robert J. Bentley, former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore and corruption in state politics. See also * List of newspapers in Alabama  References  *Emily Jones, ed.

Education Rouse was born in Wallasey and began climbing at the age of 15, soon climbing many of the most difficult routes in North Wales. He attended Birkenhead School from 1963 to 1970 and Emmanuel College, Cambridge until 1973. At Cambridge he was distracted from his studies by climbing and by his hedonistic life-style. He was a highly sociable, but heavy drinker; by his own admission he was a 'womaniser', and liked to 'live on the edge'.Birtles, Geoff, Alan Rouse: A Mountaineer's Life, HarperCollins, 1987 () As a result, he only managed to gain an ordinary pass degree in Mathematics, despite showing early promise in the subject. On leaving Cambridge he worked periodically in teaching but was often away on climbing expeditions. Mountaineering Rouse was an outstanding technical rock climber, one of the best of his generation. His ascents of 'The Beatnik' on Helsby, and his solo ascent of 'The Boldest'Wilson, Ken and Newman, Bernard, Extreme Rock, p134. Diadem 1987 () on Clogwyn Du'r Arddu marked him out as an exceptional talent. He was a member of a group of contemporaries (including Cliff Phillips, Eric Jones, Pete Minks, 'Richard' McHardy) whose competitive spirit pushed them to solo the hardest routes of the day. Rouse (with Minks) was considered to have raised the standards at Gogarth sea cliffs with the ascent of Positron in 1971. His soloing was not confined to Wales, nor was it always successful. An attempt on the American Route on South Face of the failed when a small piton being used for aid pulled near the summit. Although he fell only 5 metres, Rouse broke his ankle and was forced to make 17 abseils down the entire route, for much of the time using only his knees.Taylor, Colin: The Alps, Notes 1971, Alpine JournalRouse's own account of this accident can be found in \\"Cambridge Mountaineering 1972\\" p29-31 Rouse eventually became a professional mountaineer, lecturing, guiding, writing and acting as an adviser to the outdoor equipment trade. He moved to Sheffield in easy reach of the rocks of the Peak District. Rouse became a highly experienced climber in places as far afield as Scotland, North Wales, Patagonia, Peru, the Alps, the Andes, New Zealand and Nepal. He was also elected vice-president of the British Mountaineering Council. In 1980, Rouse, Dr Michael Ward and Chris Bonington were among the few Europeans to visit the high mountains of China, reopening some of these to foreign mountaineers. In the winter of 1980‚Äì81, Rouse led a British expedition to attempt Mount Everest by the west ridge, without using oxygen or Sherpas. The trip was not successful, but in the summer of 1981 he climbed Kongur Tagh, a hitherto unclimbed peak in western China, with Bonington, Joe Tasker and Peter Boardman. 1986 K2 disaster K2, Earth's second highest mountain, is regarded as a much more difficult climb than the highest mountain, Everest, and has a higher fatality rate. In 1983, Rouse made his first attempt on K2, by a new route up the south ridge, with an international team. In 1986, Rouse returned as the leader of a British expedition and obtained a permit to climb the difficult North-West Ridge, instead of the conventional Abruzzi Spur. After they had made several unsuccessful attempts to establish camps on their chosen route, the British team members ‚Äì apart from Rouse and fellow climber and expedition cameraman Jim Curran ‚Äì left. While Rouse and the British expedition attempted the North-West Ridge, other expeditions had also been trying various routes, with and without oxygen. After his fellow team members left the mountain, Rouse and six climbers from these expeditions decided to join forces to try the conventional route without a permit. There were four Austrian men, Alfred Imitzer, Hannes Wieser, Willi Bauer, and Kurt Diemberger, a Polish woman, Dobroslawa Miodowicz-Wolf, and a British woman, Julie Tullis. They reached Camp IV at (8,157 metres, 26,760 feet), the final staging post before the summit. For reasons that are still unclear, this impromptu team decided to wait a day before trying the final stage to the summit. None of the climbers on the Abruzzi Spur chose to follow the team comprising three Korean climbers who had set out on an oxygen aided attempt on 3 August, even though the trail would have been broken through the deep snow for those climbing without oxygen. On the following day, it was obvious that the weather was deteriorating, but Rouse and Wolf nonetheless set out for the summit. Wolf quickly tired and dropped back, whilst Rouse continued. Because he was breaking the trail alone, two of the Austrian climbers, Willi Bauer and Alfred Imitzer, caught up with him some 100 vertical meters below the summit. Rouse fell in behind the Austrians, thus making his ascent easier the last stretch, and the three reached the summit together on 4 August 1986. On the way down, they found Wolf asleep in the snow and persuaded her to descend. They also met Kurt Diemberger and Julie Tullis, still on their way up, and tried to persuade them to descend but with no success. Diemberger and Tullis also summitted but very late, at dusk which occurred around 7 pm. On the descent, Tullis fell. Even though she survived, both Tullis and Diemberger had to spend the night bivouacked in the open. Eventually, all the climbers reached Camp IV, where Hannes Wieser waited. The seven waited for the storm to abate. Instead, the storm worsened with much snow, winds over 160 km/h, and sub-zero temperatures. With no food or any gas to melt snow into water in the stoves, the situation soon became life-threatening. Tullis died during the night of 6 ‚Äì 7 August, presumably of HAPE (high altitude pulmonary edema), a common consequence of lack of oxygen and low air pressure at extreme altitudes. The other six climbers stayed for the next three days, but remained barely conscious. On 10 August the snow stopped, but the temperature dropped, and the wind continued unabated. The climbers, although severely weakened, decided they had no option but to descend to a lower base camp. Rouse, when conscious, was in agony, and the other climbers decided to leave him to save their own lives. Of the seven climbers who had originally reached Camp IV on 4 and 5 August, only Diemberger and Bauer reached Base Camp. Rouse is presumed to have died on 10 August 1986. He was survived by his girlfriend, Deborah Sweeney, who gave birth to their daughter, Holly, three weeks later. Commemoration Commemorative plaque at The Breck, Wallasey The library of the British Mountaineering Council is named in honour of Alan Rouse.

WDSY-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 17,500 watts. The transmitter is located off Shreve Street in Pittsburgh's Spring Hill district.Radio-Locator.com/WDSY-FM WDSY-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. History WDSY's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD and EAS. On August 6, 1962, WYRE-FM first signed on, co-owned with AM 1080 WYRE (now WWNL).Broadcasting Yearbook 1963 page B-159 Originally as a fully simulcast outlet of its AM sister station, it was owned by Golden Triangle Broadcasting and carried a country music format. WYRE (AM) was a daytimer station, with WYRE-FM operated primarily as a vehicle to serve listeners after the AM station was mandated to shut down after sunset. The following year, both stations switched their call signs to WEEP and WEEP- FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1965 page B-132 In the late 1960s, the Federal Communications Commission ordered FM stations to air separate programming from their AM counterparts most of the day. WEEP-FM broke away from its AM sister during the required hours, airing a softer vocal-based country music format, while its AM sister played more contemporary country hits. In 1977, WEEP-FM changed its call letters to WDSY-FM, and adopting the moniker \\"We're fresh as a Daisy!...The all new WDSY FM 108.\\" As more listeners began tuning to FM stations for music, WDSY-FM took on more of a flagship approach between the two stations, with WEEP simulcasting it, rather than the other way around. WDSY-FM evolved into a contemporary country station, and eventually was recognized as the exclusive country music outlet serving the Pittsburgh area. The station's ratings flourished in the late 1980s with the addition of two on-air personalities from top album rock station 102.5 WDVE joining the WDSY- FM lineup: morning DJ Jimmy Roach and midday personality Chris DeCarlo. In 1991, then-owner Entercom decided to change the station's branding and the station became known as \\"Pittsburgh's Country, Y108,\\" though the music and call letters remained the same. Channel mentions of 107.9 later were incorporated into the branding as more radios came equipped with digital tuners. In 1993, WDSY-FM moved from its longtime home in the Fulton Theatre (now known as the Byham Theater) building in downtown Pittsburgh to Gateway Towers, occupying space formerly used by AM 730 WPIT, which had moved to Green Tree. The station was acquired by CBS Radio in 1998.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1999 page D-383 WDSY-FM then moved to studios and offices in Foster Plaza in Green Tree, about three miles southwest of downtown Pittsburgh. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom, bringing WDSY-FM back to its former owners for the first time in nearly 20 years. CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. Ever since the Entercom merger, the station‚Äôs playlist has tightened significantly and has moved in a Top 40 direction both stylistically and musically. In April 2020, longtime station employee and afternoon drive host Brian ‚ÄúWookie‚Äù Kostek was laid off as part of massive cuts by parent company Entercom due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. As of September 2020, morning show producer ‚ÄúCowboy‚Äù Curt Hughes has also parted ways with the station, and night host Elista Hathaway‚Äôs role has been reduced to her duties with sister station WBZZ only.

He is perhaps best known today for his 21 √©tudes for solo cello that constitute the final part of the \\"Essai sur le doigt√© du violoncelle et sur la conduite de l'archet\\" (\\"Essay on the fingering of the violoncello and on the conduct of the bow\\") (1806), a seminal work of cello technique. He also wrote six cello concertos and his √âtudes pour violoncello. In 1812, Jean-Louis returned to Paris, where he encountered Napoleon, who insisted on trying out Duport's Stradivarius cello, exclaiming, \\"How the devil do you hold this thing, Monsieur Duport?\\" Duport was so obviously afraid that Napoleon would damage it, that Napoleon laughingly returned it to the cellist's more careful hands. Actually, Napoleon had made a small dent in the ribs of the cello, which may still be seen in the instrument. It was later owned by Auguste Franchomme and also Mstislav Rostropovich. \\"Essay on the fingering of the violoncello and on the conduct of the bow\\" \\"Essai sur le doigt√© du violoncelle et sur la conduite de l'archet\\" (\\"Essay on the fingering of the violoncello and on the conduct of the bow\\") is a seminal work of cello technique, by Duport, published by Imbault in Paris in 1806. The French text of 175 pages discusses in detail a wide range of aspects of cello technique, and is followed by 21 Etudes for two cellos, of various difficulty levels. The work has been translated into English and German, and is widely accepted as the most influential pedagogical work for the instrument.

Along with his brother, Jean-Louis Duport (also a cellist), he was active in the musical life of France and Germany. Jean-Pierre was the son of a dancing master, and a student of the founder of the French school of cello playing Martin Berteau (1700?‚Äì1771). Career After studying with Berteau, Jean-Pierre Duport made his debut at the age of 19 at the Concert Spirituel, then the center for non-operatic music in Paris. Between 1766 and 1769 Duport was employed by the Prince of Conti, after which he spent two years in England and two years in Spain. In 1773, Frederick the Great the King of Prussia offered Duport a position as principal cellist of his orchestra, and Duport accepted and remained in Berlin for the rest of his life. Duport was the cello tutor of Frederick's nephew, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm II, and soon after Friedrich Wilhelm II was crowned king in 1786, Duport was placed in charge of all chamber music at the court. In 1790, Duport's younger brother Jean-Louis Duport joined him in Berlin, fleeing the French Revolution. Between the two of them, and the patronage of Friedrich Wilhelm II, Berlin became a \\"magnet for new compositions for the cello\\" until Napoleon defeated Prussia and captured Berlin in 1806. At this point the younger brother returned to Paris, while the elder Duport remained in Berlin until his death in 1818. Duport and his younger brother were acquainted with Beethoven: in February 1796 Beethoven had left Vienna for a five-month concert tour which took him to Prague (accompanied by Prince Lichnowsky, who had travelled there with Mozart in 1789), Dresden, Leipzig, and Berlin, where he was inspired by the high level and quality of musical activity at the court of King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia, at which Jean-Pierre was director of chamber music.

Leonardo was recorded as being at work on one such picture in Florence in 1501 for Florimond Robertet, a secretary to King Louis XII of France. This may have been delivered to the French court in 1507, though scholars are divided on this point. The subject is known today from several versions of which two, called the Buccleuch Madonna and the Lansdowne Madonna, are thought to be partly by Leonardo's hand. The underdrawings of both paintings show similar experimental changes made to the composition (or pentimenti), suggesting that both evolved concurrently in Leonardo's workshop. The composition shows the Virgin Mary seated in a landscape with the Christ child, who gazes at a yarnwinder used to collect spun yarn. The yarn winder serves both as a symbol of Mary's domesticity and as a foreshadowing of the Cross on which Christ was crucified. The painting's dynamic composition and the implied narrative were highly influential on later High Renaissance depictions of the Madonna and Child by artists such as Raphael and Andrea del Sarto. History The earliest reference to a painting of this subject by Leonardo is in a letter of 14 April 1501 by Fra Pietro da Novellara, the head of the Carmelites in Florence, to Isabella d'Este, Marchioness of Mantua. Leonardo had recently returned to his native city following the French invasion of Milan in 1499; the intervening years he had spent first in Isabella's court, during which brief stay he produced a cartoon (now in the Louvre) for a portrait of her, and then in Venice. Isabella was determined to get a finished painting by Leonardo for her collection, and to that end she instructed Fra Pietro, her contact in Florence, to press Leonardo into agreeing to a commission. Two letters of reply by the friar survive. In the second, written after he had succeeded in meeting with the artist, he writes that Leonardo has become distracted by his mathematical pursuits and is busy working on a small painting for Florimond Robertet, which he goes on to describe: :\\"The little picture which he is doing is of a Madonna seated as if she were about to spin yarn. The Child has placed his foot on the basket of yarns and has grasped the yarn-winder and gazes attentively at four spokes that are in the form of a cross. As if desirous of the cross he smiles and holds it firm, and is unwilling to yield it to his Mother who seems to want to take it away from him.\\" The passage is valuable for being one of the few descriptions by a contemporary viewer of a work by Leonardo; it matches the composition of the Buccleuch and Lansdowne Madonnas in all respects except that there is no basket in either painting. Robertet's painting was probably commissioned late in 1499 just before Leonardo left Milan, and was possibly begun there. Scholars disagree on whether Robertet received his painting or not. In January 1507 Francesco Pandolfini, the Florentine ambassador to the French court in Blois, reported that ‚Äúa little picture by [Leonardo‚Äôs] hand has recently been brought here and is held to be an excellent thing‚Äù. The Madonna does not, however, appear in a posthumous inventory of Robertet's collection made in 1532 (though the authenticity of the inventory has been called into question). One hypothesis holds that it passed from Robertet's collection into that of the French king, thus explaining its absence from the inventory. It is unclear, however, why it would have left the royal collection. In 1525 two inventories were drawn up of the possessions of Leonardo's assistant and heir Sala√¨, who died the preceding year. These mention a ‚ÄúMadonna with a Child in her Arms‚Äù. This is thought to be evidence that one of the prime versions of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder remained in Leonardo's possession while the other was sent to Robertet. Neither of the paintings accepted as prime versions has a provenance that can be traced back to Robertet or Sala√¨, or further back than the 18th century, though the Buccleuch Madonna was in France at that time. However, the Lansdowne Madonna could easily have been bought by its earliest known owners from a French collection in the period following the French Revolution, when many works with a French aristocratic provenance were bought by British collectors. Description The composition of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder shows the Christ child twisting his body away from his mother's embrace, his eye caught by her yarnwinder whose spokes give it the shape of a cross; he precociously recognises it as a symbol of his destiny. The Virgin's reaction is ambiguous, a mixture of alarm at the harm her son will come to and resigned acceptance of it. The gesture of suspense made with her right hand is repeated from Leonardo's Milanese altarpiece The Virgin of the Rocks. The use of a symbol of the Passion as an object of childish play recurs throughout Leonardo's painted oeuvre, appearing for instance in the Benois Madonna and the Virgin and Child with St Anne. The depiction of the Virgin spinning also alludes to her antitype, Eve, who was sometimes portrayed spinning wool after her expulsion from Paradise, accompanied by her infant sons Cain and Abel. The iconography therefore recalls humanity's fall, its ensuing travails and its redemption through Christ's sacrifice. As with later works by Leonardo, the figures appear in a vast unpopulated landscape. The rocky outcrop in the foreground of the Buccleuch Madonna is painted with a minute attention to geological detail. A major difference between the Buccleuch and Lansdowne Madonnas is in their background landscapes. Whereas the background of the Buccleuch version is a watery landscape indifferently painted, that of the Lansdowne Madonna has a dramatic mountain range far more typical of Leonardo. It has been proposed that this is a specific location in the valley of the river Adda, as it runs from Lecco to Vaprio, an area familiar to Leonardo and which he mapped. It is possible that the landscape of the former picture was added by a pupil after Leonardo failed to complete the work. For Martin Kemp the ‚Äúlate‚Äù character of the landscape in the Lansdowne Madonna suggests that it was the later painting to be completed and that the Buccleuch Madonna was the one sent to Robertet in 1507. The underdrawings of both the Buccleuch and Lansdowne Madonnas show several features not in the finished works, but present in some copies; it is likely that these were originally copied from the prime versions during an early stage of the composition's development. One such feature, which appears in both underdrawings, is a group of figures identified as Saint Joseph making a baby walker for the Christ child, who appears with his mother for the Buccleuch Madonna and another female figure, probably a midwife. It has also been suggested that the child learning to walk is the infant John the Baptist, appearing with his mother Saint Elizabeth, as Leonardo would have been unlikely to depict the figures of Mary and Christ twice in the same painting. Leonardo also experimented with including some kind of beast of burden ‚Äì a horse, ass or ox ‚Äì which appears in different positions in the two underdrawings. Behind these an architectural structure with an arched opening was planned. At a later stage the landscape of the Buccleuch picture seems to have had a bridge like that of the Lansdowne Madonna, which was then painted over. Buccleuch Madonna The version of this painting often regarded as the most likely to be by Leonardo is now in the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh, on loan from the Duke of Buccleuch. It hung in his ancestral home in Drumlanrig Castle, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, until it was stolen in 2003. It entered the Buccleuch collection in 1767, with the marriage of the 3rd Duke to Lady Elizabeth Montagu, the heiress to a substantial collection of works assembled by her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Montagu. This Madonna of the Yarnwinder was bought at auction in Paris in 1756 from a sale of the collection of Marie-Joseph duc d‚ÄôHostun et de Tallard, its earliest documented owner. =Theft and recovery= In 2003 the Buccleuch Madonna was stolen from Drumlanrig Castle by two thieves posing as tourists, who said \\"Don't worry love, we're the police. This is just practice\\" to two tourists from New Zealand as they exited through a window carrying the Leonardo. In 2007 a chartered loss adjuster acting for the Duke of Buccleuch's insurers was contacted by an English lawyer, who claimed that he could arrange for the painting's return within 72 hours. The lawyer, Marshall Ronald of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, was visited by two undercover policemen who posed as an art expert and an agent for the Duke. The painting was then taken to a lawyer's office in Glasgow; this was raided by police officers from four anti- crime agencies during a meeting of five people. Four arrests were made, including of two solicitors from different firms. The Scotsman, describing the Glasgow firm as \\"one of the country's most successful and respected law firms\\", quoted a source as saying their arrested member \\"was not involved in any criminal act, but was acting as a go-between for two parties by scrutinizing a contract which would have allowed an English firm to 'secure legal repatriation' of the painting from an unidentified party.\\"Times online, October 5th, 2007 The 9th Duke of Buccleuch never lived to see the Madonna's recovery as he had died unexpectedly only a month beforehand. The painting was lent to the National Gallery of Scotland (now the Scottish National Gallery) in Edinburgh in 2009, and remains on display there as of 2020. In 2010 Ronald was cleared of the charge of holding the Duke to ransom; in 2013 he mounted legal action against the 10th Duke and the Chief Constable of Dumfries and Galloway, demanding a reward of ¬£4.25 million, which he claims he was promised in the meeting with the undercover policemen six years earlier. In 2015, the judge, Lord Brailsford, ruled these \\"arrangements were no more than a scheme designed and controlled by the police in an attempt to obtain the return of the stolen property\\" and rejected Ronald's claim against the Duke, who said \\"my involvement in supporting the 'sting' operation which involved an undercover police officer was entirely at the request of and under the direction of the police\\". Lansdowne Madonna The painting sometimes considered the second prime version of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder takes its name from the Marquesses of Lansdowne, who owned it in the 19th century. John Henry Petty, then Earl Wycombe and later the 2nd Marquess of Lansdowne, bought it some time in or before 1809, possibly from the Earl of Darnley. It is first recorded in a sale of the Dowager Marchioness of Lansdowne's collection in 1833, from which it was withdrawn. The painting remained in her family until 1879, when her daughter sold it to Cyril Flower, later Lord Battersea. In 1908 the Madonna was bought from his widow by the Paris-based art dealers Nathan Wildenstein and Ren√© Gimpel. They consulted Bernard Berenson, the leading connoisseur of the day, on the attribution in 1909; he confirmed an earlier attribution to il Sodoma but thought that Leonardo had been responsible up to the cartoon stage. During restoration work in around 1911 the painting was transferred to canvas and several alterations were made, most significantly the removal of a loincloth covering the Child's genitals and the fingers of the Virgin's left hand. The painting was bought as a Sodoma in 1928 by Robert Wilson Reford, a Canadian industrialist and shipping magnate. In the 1930s it underwent X-ray and ultraviolet examination for the first time, led by a team which included the art historian Wilhelm Suida. He concluded that the Christ child and the landscape were by Leonardo and the remainder was by a Milanese pupil. During a loan to the New York World's Fair in 1939 the painting was damaged and further restoration work had to be undertaken. Reford's family put it up for auction in 1972, but by then the attribution had reverted to Sodoma, inevitably resulting in a lower price than had it been accepted as a Leonardo. It was bought back by Wildenstein & Company, who arranged for it to be transferred a second time, this time onto a composite panel, in 1976. They sold the Madonna (as a Leonardo) to its current owner, an anonymous private collector, in 1999. Influence and copies Nearly forty versions of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder made by pupils and followers of Leonardo survive today. Many show elements which were discarded as the prime version, or versions, evolved over a long period of time. Some include the figure group in the middle ground visible in the Buccleuch and Lansdowne underdrawings; others show the basket of wool described by Fra Pietro da Novellara, though to Christ's side rather than beneath his foot. Eight paintings, including the copy in the Louvre, show a different kind of rocky outcrop in the foreground from those in the prime versions; many of these are probably by Lombard Leonardeschi. Some artists elaborated on Leonardo's composition with the addition of still lives or extra figures. The Madonna of the Yarnwinder‚Äôs composition was especially popular in Spain, where it might have been brought over by Fernando Y√°√±ez de la Almedina or Hernando de los Llanos (whose name also appears as Fernando de Llanos). Both painters were trained in Florence in the first years of the 16th century, and either might be the ‚ÄúFerrando spagnolo‚Äù mentioned as a pupil of Leonardo when the master was working on the fresco of the Battle of Anghiari in the Palazzo della Signoria in 1505. =List of copies= * Madonna of the Yarnwinder (drawing after Leonardo), Uffizi, Florence. * Madonna of the Yarnwinder, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Dijon. * Madonna with the Yarnwinder, formerly Wood Prince Collection, Chicago. * Attributed to Fernando Y√°√±ez de la Almedina, Madonna of the Yarnwinder, Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh. * Fernando Y√°√±ez de la Almedina, The Holy Family (1523), formerly in the Carlos Grether collection, Buenos Aires * Attributed to Fernando Y√°√±ez de la Almedina, Madonna of the Yarnwinder, Museo de Bellas Artes, Murcia * Attributed to Fernando Y√°√±ez de la Almedina, Madonna and Child with the Infant St John (), National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. * Hernando de los Llanos, Rest on the Flight into Egypt (1507), Valencia Cathedral. * Madonna of the Yarnwinder, Worcester Art Museum, Worcester, MA * Madonna of the Yarnwinder, Granada Cathedral. * Madonna of the Yarnwinder (), Apsley House, London. * Madonna of the Yarnwinder, Museo Soumaya, Mexico City. * Madonna of the Yarnwinder, Prince's Palace of Monaco. * Madonna of the Yarnwinder, Wittelsbacher Ausgleichsfonds, Munich. * Madonna of the Yarnwinder in a Rocky Landscape, Christ Church Picture Gallery, Oxford. * Madonna of the Yarnwinder (), Louvre, Paris. * Madonna of the Yarnwinder, follower of Leonardo da Vinci, circa 1500, unfinished.

Legendary origins  The Massimo family is sometimes referred to as one of the oldest noble families in Europehttps://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/21/arts/behind-palazzo-walls-an- exclusive-charm.html. According to the Augustine historian Onofrio Panvinio (1529-1568) in his work \\"De gente Maxima\\" of 1556, the family descends in the male line from the ancient Gens Fabia or \\"Maximi\\" of republican Rome and from Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus (c. 275 BC ‚Äì 203 BC), called Cunctator (\\"the Delayer\\"). When asked by Napoleon (with whom he was negotiating the Treaty of Tolentino) whether the family descended from Fabius Maximus, the then Prince Massimo famously replied: ¬´Je ne saurais en effet le prouver, c‚Äôest un bruit qui ne court que depuis douze cents ans dans notre famille¬ª (\\"I can not actually prove it, it's a rumour that only runs for twelve hundred years in our family\\"). The Massimo family is also said to have provided two popes to the Catholic Church, both saints - Pope Anastasius I (reigned 399-401)https://catalog.digitallatin.org/authority-record/31032, who denounced the Origenist heresy, and Pope Paschal I (reigned 817-824)https://popehistory.com/popes/pope-st-paschal-i/, who resisted the Frankish Kings and was involved in one of the earliest attempts to Christianise Scandinavia.  History  The current family's better documented history traces back to a Massimo who flourished c. 950 AD, and is identified in the person of Leo de Maximis by 1012. Thereafter the family grew in influence among the Roman barons, and played a considerable part in the history of the city in the Middle Ages, producing numerous cardinals, ambassadors, and civil and military leaders. Massimo Massimo (died 1465) served as Rome's chief conservator, a post held by several subsequent members of the family. Luca Massimo (died 1550) was granted the title \\"Baron of Pisterzo\\" in 1544 and Fabrizio Camillo Massimo of the Arsoli branch of the family became \\"Marquis of Roccasecca\\" in 1686. Two branches descended from sons of Angelo Massimo (1491‚Äì1550), who became first Lord (Signore) of Intrafiumara in 1520; that of Tiberio, whose descendants became Dukes of Rignano and Calcata, and died out in 1907, and that of Fabrizio Massimo (1536‚Äì1633), who obtained the lordship of Arsoli in 1574.http://www.prolocodiarsoli.it/storia%20castello%20massimo.htm During the War of the Spanish Succession his descendant Giovanni Camillo Massimo (1659-1711) was sent to protect Italy's interests in the north. In 1711, Giovanni Camillo was executed by Spain and his youngest son Francesco Giovanni Massimo (1696‚Äì1745) took asylum in the commune of Massimino, which by 1713 declared sovereign independence. Massimiliano Camillo Massimo (1770‚Äì1840) of the latter line was granted the title Prince of Arsoli, by Pope Leo XII and Prince for all descendants in 1826.https://archive.org/stream/almanachdegotha1922goth#page/384/mode/2up. His grandson, Carlo Camillo (1836‚Äì1921), 3rd Prince of Arsoli was additionally made a Roman prince in 1854. His son Francesco Camillo, Prince Massimo and Prince of Arsoli (1865‚Äì1943) became \\"Sopraintendente Generale delle Poste Pontificie\\", and his grandson Leone, Prince of Arsoli and Prince Massimo (1896‚Äì1979) became Duke di Anticoli-Corrado in 1904 by avuncular cession. Another grandson of the 1st Prince of Arsoli, Don Filippo Massimo (1843‚Äì1915), inherited the fortune and adopted the marital surname of the Prince's eldest daughter Donna Giuseppina Massimo (1799‚Äì1862), who was the widow and heiress of Ottavio Lancellotti, Prince of Lauro (1789‚Äì1852). Although the senior line of Don Filippo's descendants retains the Lancellotti surname and title, his younger son Don Luigi (1881‚Äì1968), resumed the paternal name in the combination of \\"Massimo Lancellotti\\", and his descendants flourish, having been granted the Italian title \\"Prince of Prossedi\\" in 1932. Although ancient and powerful, the post-medieval Massimo were not a sovereign family, yet repeated heads of the family and other family members contracted a remarkable number of marriages with members and descendants of reigning royal dynasties into the late 20th century, consistently so after the marriage in 1765 of Papal postmaster Camillo Francesco Massimo (1730‚Äì1801), Marquis of Roccasecca, to Barbara Savelli-Palombara (1750‚Äì1826), the last of the great line of the Papal Savelli family and heiress to a large fortune. Their son the first Prince of Arsoli, Massimiliano Camillo Massimo (1770‚Äì1840), married Princess Cristina of Saxony (1775‚Äì1837) in 1796, daughter of Xavier of Saxony, Prince of Poland and Lithuania, a younger son of King Augustus III of Poland. Massimiliano's son, the 2nd Prince of Arsoli Camillo Vittorio Massimo (1803‚Äì1873), married HRH Princess Maria of Savoy-Carignano (1811‚Äì1837] in 1827, the head of whose family became Charles Albert, King of Sardinia four years later and his son, King Victor Emmanuel II (1820‚Äì1878), became the first King of a united Italy in 1861. The third Prince of Arsoli, Camillo Carlo Massimo (1836‚Äì1873) wed Donna Francesca Lucchesi Palli (1836‚Äì1923), a half- sister of the Legitimist pretender to the French throne Henri, Count of Chambord through her mother Princess Maria Carolina of Bourbon-Sicily (1798-1870) daughter of the Neapolitan King Francis I of the Two Sicilies and widow of Charles X of France's assassinated heir, Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry. They had two sons, Francesco Massimo, 4th Prince of Arsoli and Prince Massimo (1865‚Äì1943), who married Donna Eleonora Brancaccio (1875‚Äì1943) in 1895 (daughter of Salvatore Brancaccio, Prince of Triggiano), and Fabrizio Massimo (1868‚Äì1944) who in 1895 had been ceded the tiles of Prince of Roviano and Duke of Anticoli-Corrado, and who in 1897 married HRH Princess Beatrice of Bourbon (1874‚Äì1961), daughter of the Carlist pretender to the French and Spanish thrones, Carlos, Duke of Madrid. Prince Fabrizio and the Infanta had no sons, and in 1904 he ceded the dukedom of Anticoli-Corrado to his nephew Prince Leone Massimo, son of his elder brother the 4th Prince of Arsoli. Prince Leone (1896‚Äì1979) also became 5th Prince of Arsoli and Prince Massimo in 1943, having in 1935 wed HRH Princess Maria Adelaide of Savoy-Genoa (1904‚Äì1979), daughter of Prince Thomas, Duke of Genoa (1854‚Äì1931) and first cousin of then- reigning Victor Emmanuel III of Savoy, King of Italy. The Massimo tradition of royal intermarriage continued when, in 1989, Prince Carlo Massimo (born 1942) married Do√±a Elisa Osorio de Moscoso y Estagna (born 1946), daughter of Pedro, Duke de Montemar (1904‚Äì1986), whose paternal great-grandmother was the Infanta Luisa Teresa de Borb√≥n-Cadiz, daughter of the Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain (1824‚Äì1900) by her marriage to Jos√© Osorio de Moscoso, Duke de Sessa. The princely family is represented by Fabrizio Massimo-Brancaccio, Prince of Arsoli and Triggiano (born 1963), and by Stefano Massimo, Prince of Roccasecca dei Volsci (born 1955), whose heir is Prince Valerio Massimo (born 1973).https://companycheck.co.uk/director/917428655/PRINCE-VALERIO-CAMILLO- FRANCESCO-MASSIMO-DI- ROCCASECCA/summaryhttp://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/engagements/110305/prince- valerio-massimo-di-roccasecca-and-miss-a.b.-owens.

Significance The family were major patrons of the arts, with the brothers Pietro and Francesco Massimo acquiring fame by protecting and encouraging the German printers Sweynheim and Pannartz, who came to Rome in 1467, where the first printed books in Italy were produced in the Massimo Palace. In the 17th century Cardinal Camillo II Massimo was famous as the patron of both Velasquez and Poussin. The Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne in Rome was built by the celebrated Sienese architect Baldassare Peruzzi by order of Pietro Massimo, on the ruins of an earlier palace destroyed in the sack of Rome in 1527. The curved fa√ßade is built on and dictated by the foundations of the stands for the stadium odeon of the emperor Domitian. The interior ceilings and vestibules are elaborately ornamented with rosettes and coffered roofs. The entrance ceiling is decorated with a fresco by Daniele da Volterra, who represented \\"Life of Fabius Maximus\\". The chapel on the 2nd floor was a room where the 14-year-old Paolo Massimo, son of Prince Fabrizio Massimo, was recalled briefly to life by Saint Philip Neri on March 16, 1583.

He fought with the Virginia militia in the Revolutionary War and represented Virginia in the U.S. Congress from 1797 until 1804. LifeFamily life= John was born on his father's farm near New London in Lunenburg County, Virginia. He was one of the eight children of William Trigg (1716 - 1773) and Mary (Johns) Trigg (1720 - 1773). His father, William served as a judge in Bedford County (which was formed from part of Lunenburg County in 1754) for many years. His brother, Abram, would serve with him in congress. The Trigg and Johns families both arrived in Virginia from England in the mid-seventeenth century. Mary Johns was, in fact, a descendant of Captain John Fox of London, a tobacco merchant and ship's captain who received a land grant from his patron King Charles II in 1667. The Triggs were from Cornwall. John married Dianna Ayers on December 17, 1770, and they settled on their own plantation \\"Old Liberty\\" near what became the town of Liberty (now Bedford, Virginia). The family would grow to include seven children: Stephen, William, Nancy, Daniel, Theodosia, John Johns Jr., and Mary (Polly). Dianna survived John, living until some time after 1807. =Military service= Virginia expanded her militia as the conflict with Great Britain loomed. Trigg raised a new militia company in Bedford County in 1775Biographical Directory of the US Congress. Accessed 11 June 2006 and led it as its lieutenant. He remained with this unit throughout the war, and saw several local actions. The state's House of Delegates named him as a captain on March 23, 1778, and a major in 1781. He was a major of artillery at the Siege of Yorktown later that year, and was present at the surrender of Lord Cornwallis. After the war Trigg continued his service in the Virginia militia. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1791, and in 1793 served as a major in the Second Battalion of the Tenth Regiment of the Virginia militia. In 1796 and 1802, he was commander of the 91st Regiment of the Virginia militia.Virginia Militia Records, accessed 11 June 2006. Political career Trigg's political service started around 1781 when he became a Justice of the Peace in Bedford County.

Life From the beginning of the revolutionary movement Bartolommei was always an ardent Liberal, and although belonging to an old and noble Florentine family his sympathies were with the democratic party rather than with the moderately liberal aristocracy. In 1847-1848 his house was a center of revolutionary committees, and during the brief constitutional regime he was much to the fore. After the return of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1849 under Austrian protection, Bartolommei was present at a requiem service in the church of Santa Croce for those who fell in the late campaign against Austria; on that occasion disorders occurred and he was relegated to his country estate in consequence (1851). Shortly afterwards he was implicated in the distribution of seditious literature and exiled from Tuscany for a year. Bartolommei settled at Turin for a time and established relations with Cavour and the Piedmontese liberals. He subsequently visited France and England, and like many Italian patriots became enamored of British institutions. He returned to Florence in 1853; from that time onward he devoted himself to the task of promoting the ideas of Italian independence and unity among the people, and although carefully watched by the police, he kept a secret printing-press in his palace in Florence. Finding that the nobility still hesitated at the idea of uncompromising hostility to the house of Lorraine, he allied himself more firmly with the popular party, and found an able lieutenant in the baker Giuseppe Dolfi (1818‚Äì1869), an honest and whole-hearted enthusiast who had great influence with the common people. As soon as war between Piedmont and Austria appeared imminent, Bartolommei organized the expedition of Tuscan volunteers to join the Piedmontese army, spending large sums out of his own pocket for the purpose, and was also president of the Tuscan branch of the Societ√© Nazionale. He worked desperately hard conspiring for the overthrow of the grand duke, assisted by all the liberal elements, and on 27 April 1859, Florence rose as one man, the troops refused to fire on the people, and the grand duke departed, never to return. \\"Sapristii pas un carreau cass\\" was the comment of the French minister to Tuscany on this bloodless revolution. A provisional government was formed and Bartolommei elected gonfaloniere. He had much opposition to encounter from those who still believed that the retention of the grand duke as a constitutional sovereign and member of an Italian confederation was possible. In the summer elections were held, and on the meeting of parliament Bartolommei's unitarian views prevailed, the assembly voting the resolution that the house of Lorraine had forfeited its rights and that Tuscany must be united to Italy under King Victor Emmanuel. Bartolommei was made senator of the Italian kingdom and received various other honors. His last years were spent in educational and philanthropic work. He died on 15 June 1869, leaving a widow and two daughters. The best biography of Bartolommei is contained in Il Rivolgimento toscano e l'azione popolare, by his daughter Matilde Gioli (Florence, 1905), but the author attributes perhaps ap undue preponderance to her father in the Tuscan revolution, and is not quite fair towards Bettino Ricasoli and other leaders of the aristocratic party.

Bardot had been convicted of inciting racial hatred on four other occasions over the previous 11 years for criticizing Muslim immigration.the feast of Eid al-Adha GermanyUnited Kingdom Under the law of the United Kingdom, \\"incitement to racial hatred\\" was established as an offence by the provisions of ¬ß¬ß 17-29 of the Public Order Act 1986. It was first established as a criminal offence in the Race Relations Act 1976. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 made publication of material that incited racial hatred an arrestable offence. This offence refers to: * deliberately provoking hatred of a racial group * distributing racist material to the public * making inflammatory public speeches * creating racist websites on the Internet * inciting inflammatory rumours about an individual or an ethnic group, for the purpose of spreading racial discontent. Laws against incitement to hatred against religions were later established under the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006. However this legislation is not present in Scotland.

As the Ekam is the supreme power in Ayyavazhi, Vaikundar was the supreme power incarnate.  Muruga inviting Vaikundar  Lord Vaikundar incarnated from the sea of Thiruchendur and after telling the secret about the incarnation to Veiyelal (the mother of Sampooranathevan known as Muthukutty in human history) he walked towards Detchanam. At that time Muruga met him and fell on his feet facing the north direction. At once Vaikundar told Muruga, By saying so, Lord Vaikundar produced \\"acts\\" for all god-heads.  Acts  The rules provided for the god-heads, *Do not accept any oblations. *Do not accept bribery. *Do not accept any Pujas. *Do not accept any sacrifices. *Desires should be thrown away. *Be genuine *Let not the Maya rule you. *Do not accept any chariot festivals. *Do not accept any worship. *Do not accept Alatthi (a ritual practice in which lights are waved in front of idols) *Do not accept offerings of sandals, garlands, etc. *Do not let anyone fall at your feet. *Do not accept any Homa (Soma). When saying this Vaikundar added, \\"If any one rejects this, you will have to suffer a lot.\\"  Symbols of acceptance  Hearing this, Muruga accepted all of these, and promised to behave accordingly. Vaikundar replied, \\"If you accept, do the following things to symbolise that\\": *In your gopuram (of Thiruchendur Temple) make a crack on the top in the north side. *Turn your Idol (of Thiruchendur Temple) towards the south. *One door (of Thiruchendur Temple) should be closed for ever. *And you should close your eyes (idol of Muruga in Thiruchendur Murugan Temple and with modesty your head should remain hanging down.

The station is the flagship of Renda Broadcasting and airs an adult contemporary radio format. From mid-November until December 25, WSHH switches to all Christmas music. WSHH has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 17,000 watts. Its power is lower than some of its rivals because it broadcasts from a taller antenna, at 260 meters (853 ft) in height above average terrain (HAAT). The transmitter is co-located with NBC network affiliate WPXI-TV on Lanark Street in Pittsburgh near Interstate 279.Radio-Locator.com/WSHH The tower is in the Fineview neighborhood on Pittsburgh's North Side, with studios and offices located on Parish Street, also in Pittsburgh.WSHH.com/contact Programming WSHH's current weekday on-air staff consists of morning drive time host Melanie Heinkel, midday host Jordan Kline, and afternoon host Ron Antil. The station airs the syndicated Delilah program evenings from 7 until midnight, seven days a week. The station's weekend programming is automated with no live DJs. HistoryWJAS-FM= WSHH on a SPARC HD Radio with RDS. On March 8, 1948, the station first signed on as WJAS-FMBroadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 262 It was the FM counterpart to WJAS, owned by the Pittsburgh Radio Supply House. The two stations simulcast and were network affiliates of CBS Radio, airing its dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" As network programming moved from radio to television in the 1950s, WJAS-AM-FM carried a full service, middle of the road format of music, talk, news and sports. =Beautiful Music WSHH= In the late 1960s, WJAS-FM ended its simulcast and began playing beautiful music, which continued into the 1970s and 1980s. In 1973, WJAS-AM-FM were sold to Heftel Broadcasting.Broadcasting Yearbook 1975 page C-164 Heftel made some significant changes: WJAS switched to a talk format with the call sign WKTQ, while WJAS-FM became WSHH, using the moniker \\"Wish 100.\\" During the 1970s, beautiful music was well represented on Pittsburgh radio: WKJF, which later became WJOI, was the leader for many years, and KDKA-FM aired automated beautiful music during the day and classical music at night. (It became WPNT in 1979 with beautiful music (no more classical) and live announcers.) Despite the competition, by the late 1970s, WSHH was Pittsburgh's number two station behind KDKA. WSHH's ratings were helped by a full staff of live announcers, to add some personality and information, in addition to the instrumental music sweeps. =Nationwide Acquisition= Nationwide Communications, a division of Nationwide Insurance, bought WKTQ and WSHH in 1975.Broadcasting Yearbook 1981 page C-202 In 1982, Nationwide fired most of the WSHH staff, replacing them with an automated \\"live assist\\" format, to cut expenses. John Ford was the last live announcer before the switch. During Wish's halcyon years, the station had only two announcers for the 24-hour broadcast day - program director and morning announcer Joe Fenn and afternoon announcer Tom Malloy. Both men would work a live four-hour on-air shift, but their pre-recorded voices would be heard for another eight hours each day. =Renda Ownership= Wish was sold in October 1983 to its current owner, Renda Broadcasting Corporation.Broadcasting Yearbook 1984 page B-221 It was the first major market FM acquisition for company president Anthony F. Renda, who had also owned WIXZ (now WGBN) in suburban McKeesport during the 1970s. (Renda bought that station back in 1997.) Renda also acquired WPXZ and WECZ in Punxsutawney three years prior to the acquisition of Wish 100. While the ratings for WSHH remained high, its audience was aging, while advertisers usually prefer younger listeners. The groundwork for a format change began in 1988, when Renda lured legendary Pittsburgh DJ Jack Bogut away from WTAE to do mornings. =Switch to Adult Contemporary= In 1989, Renda Broadcasting decided to challenge former easy listening WLTJ's position as Pittsburgh's soft adult contemporary at-work station by changing WSHH itself to Soft AC, on December 26, 1989.Radio & Records Jan. 19, 1990 The switch worked with WSHH becoming the Soft AC leader. In 1997, WSHH moved from its longtime home on Crane Avenue in Green Tree to Parrish Street, just off Greentree Road and approximately a mile from the Crane Avenue building. This new building houses WSHH's studios and offices, as well as the corporate offices for Renda Broadcasting. In 2009, WSHH saw its AC rival WLTJ move to a younger direction as a Hot AC station. By 2012, WSHH became Pittsburgh's last remaining AC, when suburban AC station WLER-FM in Butler flipped to mainstream rock. Christmas Music During the Christmas Season, WSHH plays holiday-themed music. Delilah usually starts playing Christmas music in the evening first. Then the whole station plays Christmas music around the clock, beginning in mid-November. WSHH, like many other Christmas music stations, returns to regular programming on December 26. This competes with Classic Hits-formatted WWSW-FM, owned by iHeartMedia.

Early life Schmidt grew up in Coburg, F√ºrth, and Nuremberg. Due to a pregnancy at the age of 17, she was forced to leave school a year before she would have received her Abitur. Her future husband, Gerhard Schmidt (died 1984), with the assistance of both their families, supported her in raising the child while he attended university. In 1963 and 1970, she bore two more children. In 1974 her husband gave up his work as an architect, as her salary was bigger than his. Unusual for those times, he took charge of the household and cared for the children. Labor and political career Having worked at Quelle AG for quite a while, Schmidt was elected to the company's works council in 1972; she was not required to work from 1973 to 1980, because of this. From 1980 to 1988, she was the Bavarian state chairman of the labor union HBV (Gewerkschaft Handel, Banken und Versicherungen; En: Labor Union Trade, Banks and Insurances). Schmidt joined the SPD in 1972. In 1973, she and her husband founded a local chapter of the SPD youth organization. In 1980, she was elected to the Bundestag. From 1987 to 1990, she was deputy chairman of SPD-Fraktion in the Bundestag; from 1990 to 1994, she was Vice-President of the Bundestag. In 1999, she announced she would retire from politics; this retirement ended, however, in 2002, and since 22 October the same year she has been Federal Minister for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. After the grand coalition took over power in 2005, she was discharged from her office and replaced by Ursula von der Leyen.

Orchard Square also features La Coupe hair salon, Anne Heppell, Michael Spencer Jewellers, War Games Emporium and Costa. The centrepiece of the Square is a chiming clock with moving figures that depict Sheffield's cutlery trade. To mark the centre's 21st year, Orchard Square was re-developed to facilitate the expansion of the TK Maxx to a three-level anchor store into space formerly occupied by the Stonehouse pub. The re-development was finished in October 2008, and retailers began trading in new premises shortly before Christmas 2008. Orchard Square features a customer loyalty card called the VIP Card. Shoppers can sign up for the card by visiting the Orchard Square website, www.orchardsquare.co.uk, or by filling in one of the application forms and putting it in the collection box by the toilets near Waterstone's. The VIP card is not a points scheme - card holders simply show the card at participating stores to receive various discounts. Regular competitions are also held for VIP card holders.

Formed in 1996 in Norwich, they first came to national attention after their show Posh Spice Nude was a sell-out success at the 1997 Edinburgh Festival. Appearances on BBC One's Stand Up Show followed and they became regulars on Radio 4's Loose Ends programme with Ned Sherrin. They returned to Edinburgh in 1998 and 1999, selling out in critically acclaimed shows both years. They toured Britain, played Paris, New York and two sell-out years at the Singapore Comedy Festival. Owen Evans was raised in Cromer and attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) where he studied with the Moscow Arts Theatre school. As an actor, he has appeared in innumerable plays and theatre productions. He has also appeared in television adverts for Daewoo Cars, Nat-West, Ikea and Flora. As a stand-up comedian, Karl Minns won the Daily Telegraph Open Mic Award in 2001 and played the Montreal and Melbourne Comedy Festivals before returning to Edinburgh in 2002 in Comedy Clone with Nina Conti and Patrick Monaghan. The Nimmo Twins then became the face of Adnams Beer in Norfolk in TV radio and billboard adverts for two years. The Twins got their start with the Crude Apache Theatre Company. Karl Minns has written plays, comedies and musicals for both stage and radio. As a television writer he has written for Karen Taylor, Laura Solon and Phil Nichol. He wrote the TV sitcom pilot Moonmonkeys starring Karl Theobald and Dan Antopoloski. He also wrote a weekly column for the Norwich Evening News from 2002 to 2007. He was awarded the EDF Regional Columnist of The Year in January 2007. He was also nominated for the Press Gazette Media Awards Regional Columnist of the year in the same year. The Nimmo Twins briefly expanded to a trio in 1999 with the introduction of Andrew McGibbon, who performed with them during the spring and summer of that year. The first Radio 4 comedy series The Nimmo Twins in... was broadcast in 2000 and, as of 2007, is still being repeated on BBC 7, a BBC digital radio station devoted to comedy and drama. Episodes included: A Stiff Upper Lip - a tale of a Victorian era gentleman without a beard; and Lord of the Onion Rings - the tale of a Tolkien-obsessed man who works in a petrol station. Their second series, The Rapid Eye Movement, about the troupe of actors performing a man's nightly dreams, starred Martin Freeman, Chris Langham and Kevin Eldon. The show ran for three series until 2005 and was a huge critical success. The second series was nominated for the Douglas Adams Award for Radio Comedy in 2003. In their native Norfolk, they are best known for their yearly sketch show, Normal for Norfolk, which over the last ten years has grown from a pub show to break box office records at the Norwich Playhouse, playing to over 4500 people over Christmas 2005. In the early hours of 14 December 2007, Karl Minns was attacked while walking home after a performance at the city's Playhouse. He was badly injured, suffering a broken arm and fractured skull. The duo were forced to cancel the remainder of their shows for the year. Minns wrote the pilot show Mouth to Mouth, for BBC3 in January 2008. The pilot was well- received garnering good reviews and was commissioned as a 6-part series and broadcast in November 2009. The show consisted of six interlinking monologues, whose stories intersected until the whole overall story was told. The series was largely critically well received. The Stage described it as an \\"intricately-plotted love hexagon...superb and understated\\". The Times called it \\"brave and thought provoking telly, that is also very funny\\". The Radio Times called it \\"superbly written and beautifully acted\\". As a writer/performer Minns has also contributed to two series of Russell Howard's Good News on BBC3, credited as Programme Associate alongside Dan Atkinson and Steve Williams. The first series aired in winter 2009, the second series ran from March to May 2010. The programme is now in its seventh series with Minns now credited as writer.

Early life Born James Grant, Duff was the eldest son of John Grant of Kincardine O'Neil and Margaret Miln Duff of Eden, who died 20 August 1824. When his father died about 1799, his mother moved to Aberdeen, where he went to school, and then onto the Marischal College. Military career Grant Duff was to become a civil servant of the East India Company, but being impatient at the prospect of delay in obtaining a post he accepted a cadetship in 1805 and sailed for Bombay. After completing the cadet training in Bombay, he joined the Bombay Grenadiers. In 1808 Duff participated as an ensign in the storming of Maliah, a fortified stronghold of freebooters, where he displayed bravery. At an unusually early age he became adjutant to his regiment and Persian interpreter, and was even more influential in it than this position indicated. While still a lieutenant he attracted the attention of Mountstuart Elphinstone, then Company resident of Poona, and became, along with Henry Pottinger, his assistant and devoted friend. He was particularly successful in understanding the native character, and in discovering the mean between too rapid reform and too great deference to native prejudice and immobility. During the long operations against the Peshwa Bajirao II, terminating in his overthrow, Grant Duff took a considerable part, both in a civil and in a military capacity, attaining the rank of captain in his regiment. see Forrest, Official Writings of Elphinstone, pref. memoir Upon the settlement of the country he was appointed in 1818 to the important office of resident of Satara State. His instructions are contained in a letter of Elphinstone's, dated 8 April 1818, and his remuneration was fixed at 2000 rupees per month, with allowances of 1500 rupees per month, which was in addition to an office establishment.Parliamentary Papers 1873, volume xxxviii. part i. Here, in the heart of a warlike province, the centre of the Mahratta confederacy, with but one European companion and a body of native infantry, he succeeded in maintaining himself in a hostile environment. By proclamation dated 11 April 1818, Elphinstone made full powers over to Grant for the arrangement of Satara's affairs of state. Pratap Singh the Rajah was rescued from his captivity by the Maratha Peshwa, after the Battle of Ashteh in February 1819, and restored to the throne under Grant Duff's tutelage. By a treaty of 25 September 1819, Grant Duff was to administer the country in the Rajah's name until 1822, and then transfer it to himself and his officers when they should prove fit for the task. Taking great care, he impressed upon the rajah that any intercourse with other princes, except such as the treaty provided for, would be punished with annexation of his territory. He trained him so successfully in the habits of business that Pratap Singh, having improved greatly under his care, see Heber, Journal, ii. 212 was made direct ruler of Satara in 1822; but under Grant's successor, General Briggs, his behaviour was unsatisfactory.For some details of Grant\\"s administrative policy see his report on Satara in Elphinstone\\"s Report on the Territories taken from the Peshwa, 1821 . During this time, Grant concluded the treaties with the Satara jagirdars, viz. 22 April 1820, the Pant Sachiv, the Pant Pratinidhi, the Duflaykur, and the Deshmukh of Phaltan, and 3 July 1820, the Raja of Akkalkot and the Sheikh Waekur.(as the names are given by Aitcheson) The arrangements which he prescribed both for the etiquette of the Durbar and for the management of the revenue remained, as he had left them for many years. Return to Scotland After five years the anxiety and toil broke down his health, and he retired to Scotland, where he occupied himself in completing A History of the Mahrattas, the materials for which he had long been collecting with great diligence and under peculiarly favorable opportunities, through his access to state papers, family and temple archives, and his personal acquaintance with the Mahratta chiefs.(see in Colebrooke, Life of Elphinstone, several letters to and from Grant) It was published in 1826 and was translated into the major languages of Western India, becoming required reading for Indian students during the British Raj. About 1825 he succeeded to the estate at Eden, and taking the additional name of Duff settled there, improving the property. In 1850 his wife Jane Catharine Ainslie (only daughter of Sir Whitelaw Ainslie, an eminent physician and author of the Materia Medica Indica), whom he married in 1825, succeeded to an estate in Fife belonging to her mother's family, whereupon he took the further name of Cuninghame. Family Duff died on 23 September 1858, leaving a daughter and two sons, of whom the elder, Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff, M.P. for the Elgin Burghs, Under-Secretary for India 1868‚Äì1874, and Under-Secretary for the Colonies 1880‚Äì1881, and Governor of Madras Presidency 1881‚Äì1886.

After a period of domination by Carthage, the town came under Roman control after the conquest of Sardinia in 238 BCE. The city is mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana, a Roman-period itinerarium. It went into decline from the mid-5th century CE after the Vandal conquest of Sardinia. The island was taken by the Eastern Romans in 535 who ruled it for 300 years According to the Ravenna Cosmography, after the Arab conquest of Carthage in 698 the city lost its economic function and became a simple fort (Nora praesidium).Ravennatis Anonymi Cosmographia, V,26, https://archive.org/details/ravennatisanony02ravegoog , p:500 Nora appears to have been abandoned during the 8th century.Nora, History of the first Sardinian Town Its toponym, however, remained in the name of a curadoria (main administrative division) of Judicatus of Caralis at the beginning of the second millennium. Nora was an important trading town in its time, with two protected harbours, one on each side of the peninsula. Several different building styles can be seen in the excavated buildings. Because the southern part of Sardinia is sinking into the Mediterranean Sea, a substantial part of the former town is now under the sea.Tourist information on Nora A similar fate has befallen nearby Bithia, which is now completely submerged. A significant part of the town of Nora situated on land belonging to the Italian Army has not been excavated. The ruins of Nora are an open-air museum, and the remains of the theatre are occasionally used for concerts in the summer.

Its role is to promote and advance organ playing and choral music, and it offers music education, training and development, and professional support for organists and choral directors. The building in Kensington, London, which housed the Royal College of Organists from 1903-91 The College also provides accreditation in organ playing, choral directing and organ teaching; it runs an extensive education and outreach programme across the UK; and it maintains an internationally important library containing more than 60,000 titles concerning the organ, organ and choral music and organ playing. History The RCO was founded as the College of Organists in 1864 by Richard Limpus, the organist of St Michael, Cornhill in the City of London, and received its Royal Charter in 1893. In 1903 it was offered a 99-year lease at peppercorn rent on a building designed by the architect H. H. Cole in Kensington Gore, west London. When it became clear in the mid 1980s that an economic rent would be charged on expiry of that lease, the lease was sold and the College moved into new accommodation in 1991. The building subsequently become the home of property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz. In 2003 plans were announced for more permanent purpose-built premises around the Grade I listed former Curzon Street railway station in Birmingham, a notable piece of monumental railway architecture. New facilities designed by Associated Architects included a new library and 270 seat concert hall. However, in 2005 the RCO announced that this move would not be taking place and subsequently that it would no longer be looking for a permanent home of this kind, focussing instead on activities such as education, events, examinations and member services. In 2014 the College celebrated its 150th anniversary with a year-long programme of events including recitals, conferences, music festivals, courses and publications. In 2020 the RCO announced that Saturday 18 April would be its inaugural National Organ Day.

The College‚Äôs learning services includes: an extensive programme of classes, workshops and courses throughout the UK and abroad; online support through the iRCO learning hub; and teaching via RCO accredited teachers and institutions. Exams Accreditation has been central to the RCO‚Äôs work since it was founded in 1864. The College offers five diplomas. The Diploma of Colleague (CRCO) (formerly the Certificate, CertRCO) is a qualification for the intermediate organist and provides a foundation for developing organists and choral directors. The Associateship Diploma (ARCO) demonstrates high achievement in organ playing and supporting theoretical work. The Fellowship diploma (FRCO) offers a progression for those who already hold the ARCO and represents a premier standard in organ playing, which a cathedral organist would be expected to hold. The Choral Directing Diploma (Dip CHD) demonstrates achievement in choral conducting and related disciplines. The Licentiateship in Teaching (LTRCO) provides professional accreditation for organ teachers who already hold either the ARCO or FRCO. In 2016 the College introduced an early-level certificate scheme called the RCO Certificate of Accredited Membership (CAM).

The store has been trading for over 146 years and sells an extensive range of merchandise including fashion, furniture, lighting, gifts, cosmetics & fragrance, beds, domestic appliances and cookshop. Facilities include three distinct eateries and a car park located above the store, accessible via Charter Row. History John Atkinson arrived in Sheffield in 1865, and worked as an assistant at the Sheffield drapery Cole Brothers until he was 26. In 1872 he opened his own drapery in South Street, now known as The Moor, with the store specialising in hosiery, ribbons and lace. The store started to expand by 1879 purchasing its first neighbouring store, and by 1890 had been transformed from a drapery into a department store. The business was so successful that the original shop units were demolished and replaced by a new building. John Atkinson son's Harold and Walter eventually took over the running of the business from their father, who died in 1929. During the 1930s Atkinsons' had an in-store zoo, which saw a baby crocodile escape and was found dead in the lift shaft. During the Second World War the store was completely destroyed by the Blitz in 1940. The business however improvised setting up its headquarters in St. Judes Church in Milton Street, and opening departments across the city including a Kiosk outside the railway station and inside the semi-blitzed Central Cinema. The business lost all its ledgers during the blaze, however 80% of its credit accounts had been repaid within 3 months of the bombing. The business continued to be operated like this until 1960 when a new purpose built store opened on The Moor.

The United Restorer Army, led by General Manuel Bulnes, consisting mainly of Chileans and 600 North Peruvian dissidents, attacked the Peru-Bolivian Confederation forces led by Andr√©s de Santa Cruz in northern Peru, north of Lima. The decisive battle ended with a complete Restorer victory after six hours of fighting, and effectively dissolved the Peru-Bolivian Confederacy. It ended the War of the Confederation, and Santa Cruz exiled himself to Guayaquil, Ecuador. The new Peruvian government paid its debt with Chile from the liberation expedition from a decade ago, and gave awards to Chilean and Peruvian officials.Peruvian decorations awarded to Chilean Army Peruvian officers who served under the Confederation, including Guillermo Miller, Mariano Necochea, Luis Jos√© Orbegoso, Domingo Nieto, were banned from the Peruvian Army. Prologue After declaring war on the Confederacy on 1837, Chile sent an expedition led by Admiral Manuel Blanco Encalada. Avoiding an engagement, Santa Cruz was skillful enough to encircle Blanco Encalada and forced him to sign the Treaty of Paucarpata on 17 November. By this pact, Chile agreed to resume commercial trade and the Confederation would recognize and pay the Chilean efforts in the Peruvian independence war. The Chilean Congress and the public opinion considered the outcome of the expedition humiliating and rejected the treaty. Also, it was believed that Santa Cruz was behind the assassination of Diego Portales. All this invigorated an anti-confederacy sentiment, and the Chileans organized a second expedition. This time, the command was given to General Manuel Bulnes. The expedition had 5,400 Chileans and 600 expatriate Peruvians under General Agustin Gamarra. Andres de Santa Cruz, responded immediately reinstating the hostilities. The second Chilean campaign had far more success than the first one. Bulnes defeated Confederate General Orbegoso at the battle of Portada de Guias on August 21, 1838, and entered into Lima. Also, the Chilean Fleet secured sea domination in the Battle of Casma. Despite the victory, Bulnes left the city by November, and marched to Huacho in the North Peruvian territory, forced by local animosity, lack of supplies and diseases. Also, news had arrived indicating that Santa Cruz was closing in with an outnumbering army. Afterwards, Santa Cruz entered into Lima under popular ovation, then proceeded to follow Bulnes. Both armies engaged at Buin, on 6 January 1839, in the confluence of Buin and Santa rivers, with indecisive results. Bulnes continued marching north and Santa Cruz resumed the persecution seeking to deliver a final blow to cement Confederation's dominance in the region. Santa Cruz occupied Yungay, trying to cut Bulnes' supply lines and strangle the Restorers. His intention wasn't to obliterate the Restorer Army, but rather to force Bulnes to surrender to a superior Confederate force. Bulnes had other plans however, realizing that returning empty-handed was not an option after Blanco Encalada's failure. Both armies had about 6,000 men, although the numbers favored slightly the Confederates. The Chilean expedition, on the other hand, suffered the decimation of some battalions by plagues during Lima occupation. Comparably equipped, the main difference was in the preparation of the troops, the knowledge of the terrain, and the obvious differences between invaders and defenders. Contenders Marshall Andr√©s de Santa Cruz =Opposing Forces=Confederate Army The Confederate Army was made up of veterans of internal battles from both Peru and Bolivia. It was generally supported by the population of Peru and possessed strong supply lines thanks to the site of the battle. Its commanding officer, General Andr√©s de Santa Cruz; was regarded as a resourceful tactician and a capable leader. His army had about 6,000 men divided into three divisions, adding up nine infantry battalions and two cavalry regiments. Chilean Army The Restorer Army had the experience of Gen. Manuel Bulnes. On the other hand, it was not popular with the locals and was hampered due to disease, bad morale, and some less experienced units. This army of 5,400 soldiers was conformed by nine infantry battalions and three cavalry regiments grouped into four divisions. =Preliminary moves= Both armies marched under the rain, and established near Tarar from where it marched towards San Miguel. Santa Cruz after detaining in Tarhuaz, occupied the town of Yungay on 13 January. On the night of January 19, Santa Cruz sent Colonel Rodriguez Margari√±os to observe the Chilean positions. Besides, ordered that Bolivian Colonel Anselmo Quiroz with 600 soldiers to take positions on the Pan de Az√∫car Hill, while Colonel Fructuoso de la Pe√±a advanced to the Puny√°n Hill with another 200 soldiers. On 20 January, at dawn, Gen Bulnes marched with his four divisions to Yungay, whilst Santa Cruz deployed his army by the Ancash River, with Herrera's division on the right wing, in the middle was set the artillery and behind it the cavalry led by General Perez de Urdinea. Finally, Moran's division was stationed on the left flank. =Battlefield= Both forces were separated by a short valley formed by the Santa River and the mountains, with the Puny√°n, Ancash and Pan de Az√∫car hills at the far end of this site, behind these heights lay the deep Ancash Glen, followed by the Confederate trenches. The battle General Manuel Bulnes Prieto, commander of the Chilean Expeditionary Force and the Restorer Army. =Confrontation on the Puny√°n and Pan de Az√∫car hills= Bulnes decided to attack the Confederates at Puny√°n Hill first. Under Elespuru, Silva's Aconcagua Battalion was dispatched to clear out the hill. Silva succeeded and forced out de la Pe√±a's, but Elespuru was mortally wounded. After them, Bulnes sent the Portales, Valdivia and Huaylas battalions. At 9 am, a column of 400 soldiers under Jer√≥nimo Valenzuela and formed by companies from the Carampangue, Santiago, Valpara√≠so and Cazadores de Per√∫ battalions, was sent to the Pan de Az√∫car Hill to assail Col. Quiroz' position. The Restorers began the slowly climbing of the hill slope under heavy fire. The Restorer columns sustained severe losses. Valenzuela and all the officers were killed. The Carampangue's company alone was led in the end by Sergeant Candelaria Perez. The rest of the companies were severely decimated too. Nevertheless, the Restorers finally reached the summit and bayoneted the Confederates out of Pan de Az√∫car Hill. All of the defenders were killed, including Quiroz himself. The Valpara√≠so Battalion Sergeant Jose Alegr√≠a raised the Chilean flag on the Pan de Az√∫car Hill summit. =Maneuvers on the Ancash Glen= Marshall Santa Cruz sent Col. Deheza's battalion to reinforce Quiroz at Puny√°n Hill, marching through the Ancash Glen, but in their route encountered and engaged the Colchagua Battalion led by Col. Urriola, forcing the Chileans to refold with a bayonet charge. Bulnes ordered the Portales Battalion to aid Urriola, maneuver that obliged the Bolivians to pull away from the glen to Herrera's positions with a third of it initial soldiers dead. With the Pan de Az√∫car and Puny√°n hills conquered, Bulnes planned a frontal attack on Santa Cruz army, arranged in a line of trenches on the opposite bank of the Ancash River. So, the Chilean forces converged on the river's edge, and the Colchagua and Valdivia battalions were dispatched to engage the Confederate right guarded by Herrera's division, while the Portales, Cazadores de Per√∫ and Huaylas battalions were ordered to onset Col. Moran's division. The five cannon battery of Col. Marcos Maturana allocated on the Puny√°n heights began to shell and slowly dismantle the Confederate trenches. Due to the bridge over the Ancash had been destroyed, the Chileans had to descend to the river shore and march across it. When Bulnes' troops crossed the river, the battle was joined on the entire front line, with the Restorer soldiers out in the open and the Confederates firing upon them from the trenches. From this protected position, the Confederates thwarted the attack. At 14:30, Gen. Pedro Berm√∫dez drove his 3rd of Bolivia Battalion in a bayonet charge upon the Portales Battalion, which broke its lines under the Bolivian pressure. Following, the cavalry was sent to cut off the Chilean retreat while the infantry forwarded from their protecting positions to attack the Restorers troops in the open field. =Decisive blow= Having witnessed the Chilean retreat, Gen. Bulnes took command of the Valpara√≠so Battalion and crossed the Ancash heightening Col. Garcia's unit. Likewise, the Santiago and half Huaylas battalions strengthened the Chilean right wing, allowing the relieved units to gather up and resume the attack. A few confederate battalions managed to return to their trenches. Perez de Urdinea's cavalry crossed the river and clashed with Baquedano's Cazadores a Caballo Cavalry Regiment. By fighting so near to the Confederate lines, Baquedano was wounded and forced to retreat. However, the Chilean cavalry attacked again with full force, making Perez de Urdinea to regroup with the Confederate infantry trying to retreat to their trenches. On a third massive charge, Baquedano broke Santa Cruz' left flank and the entire Confederate front collapsed. With both armies now engaged in the gap between the trenches and the river, the Confederates tried to resist but were surrounded and completely vanquished. The disbanded troops were pursued by the Chilean cavalry and killed. According to Gonzalo Bulnes, 277 Confederates were found dead on the road between Manco and Yungay. Santa Cruz, followed by his generals Riva Ag√ºero, Cerde√±a and Miller, left the battlefield around 15:00. Aftermath This was a decisive defeat for the Peru-Bolivian Confederacy. Santa Cruz had around 3,000 casualties, including 2 generals, 9 colonels, 100 officers and 2,500 soldiers, equivalent to a 50% of its effective force. The Restorer Army lost 1 general, 39 officers and 622 soldiers. The Battle of Yungay brought the Peru-Bolivian Confederacy to an end. The Chilean Expeditionary Force reoccupied Lima on April. On 25 August 1839. General Agust√≠n Gamarra assumed the Presidency of Peru, and officially declared the dissolution of the Confederation and the Union of the North and South Peru. Santa Cruz was exiled, first to Guayaquil, Ecuador, then to Chile and finally to Europe,Biograf√≠a de Andr√©s de Santa Cruz en Biograf√≠as y Vidas where he died in Beauvoir, France, on September 25, 1865. He was 72. Manuel Bulnes returned to Chile. He was elected President of Chile for two consecutive periods, from 1841 to 1851.

Because these machines record votes internally, in computer software, vote fraud may be difficult to detect. Reconciling the electronic vote count with the physical vote count in all, or a random sampling of, machines allows poll- workers to screen for fraud. The election benefits from the efficiency of the DRE machines and the confidence instilled by a physical record. The method works by displaying a paper vote record under glass or clear plastic after the voter indicates their vote(s). The voter is instructed to verify that the paper record correctly indicates their vote. They finalize their vote by pressing a button or pulling a lever, and the paper record is stored. (This is called a voter verified paper audit trail.) At no point can the voter remove the paper record from the voting area. To do so would allow for there to be a receipt that could be used to coerce the voter into voting for a candidate or to allow selling of votes.

Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Co.; 1995 In the medical context, it usually refers to the surgical correction of a disfiguring defect, or the cosmetic improvements made by a surgeon following incisions. Its use is generally limited to the additional, usually minor, steps that the surgeon (who is generally operating for noncosmetic indications) takes to improve the aesthetic appearance of the scars associated with the operation. Typical actions include removal of damaged tissue, mitigation of tension on the wound, and/or using fine (thin) sutures to close the outer layer of skin. Cosmetic surgery is the portion of plastic surgery that concerns itself with the elective improvement of cosmesis. Prosthetic limbs The practice of cosmesis, the creation of lifelike limbs made from silicone or PVC, has grown in popularity. Such prosthetics, such as artificial hands, can now be made to mimic the appearance of real limbs, complete with freckles, veins, hair, fingerprints, and even tattoos. Custom-made silicone cosmeses are generally more expensive, costing thousands of US dollars depending on the level of detail. Standard cosmeses come ready-made in various sizes, though they are often not as realistic as their custom-made counterparts. Another option is the custom-made silicone cover, which can be made to match a person's skin tone, but not details such as freckles or wrinkles. Cosmeses are attached to the body using an adhesive, suction, form- fitting, stretchable skin, or a skin sleeve. Cosmeses act as a barrier from dirt, water and other particles, thus protecting the technology inside the glove.

Its transmitter is located in Pittsburgh's Spring Hill district and its studios are located west of downtown. Due to the presence of co-channel WMMS in Cleveland, WBZZ only partially covers the northwestern Pittsburgh radio market. History WBZZ's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD and EAS. =Beginnings as WYDD= 100.7 originally signed on the air in 1963 as WYDD with a power of 10,000 watts in New Kensington, operating as the FM sister station of WKPA, also licensed to New Kensington. In 1967 another FM license, WPGH-FM, was dropped in Pittsburgh at 104.7. The owner of WYDD, Gateway Broadcasting Enterprises, applied for 104.7 and the FCC granted the license. WYDD assumed 104.7, changed its city of license to Pittsburgh, and increased its power to 50,000 watts. A condition of the grant was that Gateway would have to sell the 100.7 frequency to stay compliant with FCC rules and regulations at the time that forbade a licensee to own more than one FM and one AM in a single market. =As WNUF= Because New Kensington was part of the Pittsburgh market, 100.7 was sold to Millvale-based publisher Milton Hammond, who used the channel for WNUF. The city of license remained New Kensington with a new transmitter site in Russellton. The owner tried to get the call-letters WFUN, but since it was already assigned to another station, the station settled for \\"fun\\" backwards, hence the WNUF call-letters. During the construction phrase of WNUF, an agreement was reached with WOMP (100.5 FM) that allowed both stations to increase their power without subjecting one or the other to co-channel interference. WNUF received permission to increase its power from 10,000 to 20,000 watts. WNUF's studios and offices were co-located with a weekly buy-sell-trade publication called The Green Sheet, both of which were owned by Hammond. Since the building for the publication was owned by Hammond, the station was located there during the period he owned it. The station became known for its Big Band music format. While WNUF broadcast in stereo, since much of the Big Band music it played was recorded before the advent of stereo, many of the recordings were actually a form of \\"simulated\\" stereo or electronically re-recorded to simulate stereo. Though licensed to a suburb almost 20 miles from Pittsburgh, WNUF identified itself as a \\"North Hills\\" station. DJs were instructed to identify the station as \\"WNUF (speak softly and mumble) licensed to New Kensington (say clearly and loudly) North Hills\\". In 1979, WNUF was granted an increase from 20,000 to 50,000 watts effective radiated power. The station still operated at 20,000 watts but moved to a different tower just outside Millvale, which allowed its antenna to broadcast from a much greater height. However, reception still proved to be a problem in Pittsburgh's South Hills and parts of the city. Tal Weimer, Bill Trushel, Darrel Deiter, Dino Orsatti, Rich Beno, Fred Moulton, Craig Perry, Ron Miskoff, Larry Kemp and Christian Muro were among the announcers during the days when Hammond owned the station. =As WWCL= In 1983, the station flipped to soft rock as WWCL, taking the moniker \\"Classy 101\\", advertising itself heavily with a series of TV commercials inviting potential listeners to call or write with feedback to improve the station, \\"because you're building Classy 101!\\" The attempt failed to make any kind of ratings success, largely due to its signal that limited it to listenership in Pittsburgh's North Hills and eastern suburbs, with listeners south of the city of Pittsburgh unable to hear it. The station also faced heavy competition from established soft rocker 3WS and from longtime easy-listening WPNT, which had operated for years as KDKA-FM. The latter station also switched to soft rock that same year and embarked on a heavy advertising campaign that proved to be highly successful. =As WXXP= On January 3, 1985, the station was sold by Hammond to Empire Media Corporation, then flipped formats to alternative rock as WXXP (\\"Double X 100.7\\"). The station also moved to 224 North Avenue in Millvale, a few blocks from the Hammond building. This was Pittsburgh's first alternative station. While the station did improve somewhat, it did not prosper. However, after its 1988 sale and subsequent format switch, its success under alternative rock inspired an AM station, WXVX, to assume the format. =As WMXP= On August 1, 1988, the station was acquired by Pittsburgh Partners (dba Signature Broadcasting). On August 22, the format flipped to hot adult contemporary, and assumed the call letters WMXP, with the slogan \\"Mix 100.7\\". Waylon Richards served as the station's new program director. However, with the flip of crosstown competitor WSHH to soft adult contemporary also that year, \\"Mix 100.7\\" found it difficult to compete with three other adult contemporary stations, and was still plagued by signal limitations. After short-lived but successful Top 40 station WNRJ was sold and switched to an easy-listening format, WMXP took advantage of the opportunity and made the switch to Rhythmic top 40, taking on the identity of \\"Mix Jamz\\" in late 1990. Rich Hawkins then assumed duties of program director. The following year, WMXP moved its transmitting antenna from Millvale to a nearby television broadcast tower owned by WPGH-TV. This allowed listeners in Pittsburgh's South Hills suburbs to hear the station for the very first time, and allowed full signal penetration within Pittsburgh's city limits. =As WQKB= While the format switch was successful, it would last until Midnight on January 1, 1993, when, after playing \\"End of the Road\\" by Boyz II Men, the station began stunting with all-Garth Brooks music as \\"K-Garth\\". On January 6, WMXP flipped to country as \\"K-Bear 100.7\\" (the WQKB calls were adopted on March 3, 1993). The switch came following the sale of the station to EZ Communications (owner of direct competitor B-94) from Signature Broadcasting.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-01-08.pdf Announcers Bill Webster and Jay Silvers under the \\"Mix Jamz\\" banner were retained under the new format. =As WZPT= On October 7, 1994, the station flipped to all-1970s‚Äô hits as \\"The Point 100.7\\", along with a change to new WZPT call letters.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Billboard/90s/1994/BB-1994-10-22.pdf The station added ‚Äò80s‚Äô music to its playlist in March 1997 (with the new slogan of \\"The Hits of the ‚Äò70s and ‚Äò80s).http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=list&p;_topdoc=21 By October 1999, WZPT would drop the ‚Äò70s‚Äô music, and added ‚Äò90s‚Äô music to its playlist, with a shift to Hot AC, while still being branded as \\"The Point\\". At 6 PM on June 3, 2000, WZPT was rebranded as \\"Star 100.7\\". \\"Star 100.7\\" logo used from 2006-2011 During its tenure as a Hot AC, the station called itself \\"Pittsburgh's Best Variety of the ‚Äô80s, ‚Äô90s and Today.\\" One of their more popular music features was \\"Flashback Friday,\\" consisting of mostly ‚Äô80s and some ‚Äò90s music. Despite airing more of a mix of current music with ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s, WZPT's format was similar to that of sister station WBZZ (\\"B94\\"). In fact, after that station initially dropped the Top 40 format for active rock in 2004, listeners who liked B94 but didn't care for the new rock format were encouraged on-air to listen to WZPT. =As WBZZ= On January 19, 2010, B94 (93.7 FM) changed again, this time to sports talk as KDKA-FM (\\"93.7 The Fan\\"). CBS Radio also announced that they would merge Star with B94 to bring B94's music and some on-air personalities onto Star for listeners to continue to enjoy. In doing so, WZPT eliminated the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s tracks in favor of Adult Top 40 music, playing current and recent current music only. Star added more rhythmic artists such as Lady Gaga, Kesha, and Timbaland in addition to artists such as Shinedown, Kelly Clarkson and John Mayer. On January 5, 2011, CBS Radio reacquired the WBZZ calls (which were approved on January 19, 2011) from the former WQSH-Albany, New York and plans to use the calls to replace the WZPT calls.\\"WBZZ Returns To Pittsburgh\\" from RadioInsight (January 10, 2011) In October 2011, the station rebranded slightly as \\"100.7 Star.\\" The station also introduced a new logo. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. On July 24, 2019 According to All Access.com, WBZZ has changed its Mediabase reporting panel from Hot AC to Top 40. HD radio WBZZ-HD2 logo as \\"B94 Replay\\" 100.7 began HD Radio operations in 2006. 100.7 HD-1 carried the standard analog format, while 100.7 HD2 carried a 1980s/1990s hits format dubbed the \\"80s/90s Flashback Channel\\" (named after their popular \\"Flashback Friday\\" program at the time). When the station rebranded as \\"100.7 Star\\" in October 2011, the HD2 channel shifted its format to include 2000s hits, and was renamed \\"Replay Radio\\", which includes heavy references to former sister station B94. WBZZ added an HD3 channel in August 2012, carrying CBS Radio's alternative-talk format, branded as \\"The Sky.\\" The Sky was also carried on Seattle's KMPS-HD3 and Boston's WBMX-HD4. In early 2014, the HD3 channel flipped to Top 40/CHR, branded as \\"AMP Radio. As of July 25, 2018, WBZZ-HD3 changed to a simulcast of WAMO (AM), which aired a rhythmic contemporary format. On June 25, 2019, WAMO (AM) flipped to Urban AC as \\"107.3 The Beat\\", with the rhythmic format remaining on WBZZ-HD3 and FM translator 100.1 W261AX.107.3 The Beat Launches in Pittsburgh Radioinsight - June 25, 2019 References Early History of 100.7 by Ed DeHart, employee from 1968 to 1971.

Life The son of a carrier who came from Scotland, and plied between Norwich and London, he was born at Norwich late in 1740. He was sent by his father to Amsterdam for a year to complete his school education, and entered in 1760 Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. 1764, M.A. 1767, and D.D. 1797. In 1765 he was elected to a fellowship in his college, he acted for some time as its sub-tutor, and in 1771 he was the junior proctor of the university. Having been ordained in the English church, he served for some years as the minister of the sequestrated benefice of Hinxton, Cambridgeshire. He was nominated by his college in 1773 to the rectory of St Mary Abchurch with St Laurence Pountney, London, but before he could be instituted he exchanged for the rectory of Snailwell, Cambridgeshire. When the headship of his college became vacant in 1778; but he declined the offer of it, and was promoted by Bishop James Yorke in 1796 to the rectory of Leverington, in the Isle of Ely. As magistrate for Cambridgeshire and chairman for many years of the sessions at Cambridge and Ely, he studied the Poor Laws and other economic questions affecting his district. He was also for some time chaplain to John Hobart, 2nd Earl of Buckinghamshire. After a long illness he died at Leverington on 16 October 1808, aged 67, and was buried in the church, where his widow erected a monument to his memory on the north side of the chancel. He had married in 1774 Susanna, daughter of John Salmon, rector of Shelton, Norfolk, and sister of Benjamin Salmon, fellow of his college. She died at Norwich on 11 November 1814, aged 75, bequeathing sums to charity. Works Nasmith devoted his leisure to antiquarian research, and he was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 30 November 1769. He was occupied in arranging and cataloguing the manuscripts which Archbishop Matthew Parker gave to his college. The catalogue was finished in February 1775, and presented by him to the Master and Fellows, who directed that it should be printed under his direction, and that the profits of the sale should be given to him. Nasmith edited: * Catalogus librorum manuscriptorum quos collegio Corporis Christi in Acad. Cantabrigiensi legavit Matth√¶us Parker, archiepiscopus Cantuariensis, 1777. * Itineraria Symonis Simeonis et Willelmi de Worcestre, quibus accedit tractatus de Metro, 1778. * Notitia Monastica, or an Account of all the Abbies, Priories, and Houses of Friers formerly in England and Wales, by Thomas Tanner. Additions consisted mainly of references to books and manuscripts. Many copies of this edition were destroyed by fire on 8 February 1808. Nasmith was also author of: * The Duties of Overseers of the Poor and the Sufficiency of the present system of Poor Laws considered. A charge to the Grand Jury at Ely Quarter Sessions, 2 April. With remarks on a late publication on the Poor Laws by Robert Saunders, 1799. * An Examination of the Statutes now in force relating to the Assize of Bread, 1800. Saunders, a critic from Lewisham of corruption in the oversight of the existing Poor Law system, replied to these pamphlets in An Abstract of Observations on the Poor Laws, with a Reply to the Remarks of the Rev.

There are nine known pieces of the Yama Zatdaw in Myanmar. The Burmese name for the story itself is Yamayana, while zatdaw refers to the acted play or being part of jataka tales of Theravada Buddhism. The Yama Zatdaw was introduced by oral tradition during King Anawratha's reign although it was not known clearly whether the story was Valmiki‚Äôs Sanskrit epic Ramayana or not. In the Nathlaung Temple, the Visnu temple, within the walls of old city Bagan, there are some stone sculptures, one of which is Ramachandra. Based on Burmese literature, at least, Hanuman has been known in Burma definitely before 1527 AD. The Burmese Ramayana was influenced greatly by Ayutthaya Kingdom, during which various Konbaung Dynasty kings invaded the kingdom. The invasions often brought back spoils of war, including elements of Ramakien (Thai version of Ramayana) into the epic. Rama sƒÅ-khyan, one of the well known literature in Burma, is believed to be composed in 1775 by U Aung Phyo which begins with Bala kanda and ends at Yudha kanda as in Valmiki's Ramayana. There are also important Burmese literature and classical music related to the Ramayana which were developed in that era such as U Toe's Yama yakan (Rama's song, and Thida yakan (Sita's song, ), both written in 1784; Yama pyazat (Ramayana ballet, ) in 1789; and Kalay Yama wuthtu (Young Rama's life, ) in 1800.\\"Ramayana, the old ancient wonder of the world was one center of a romantic powerful empire\\" The ethnic Mon adaptation of Ramayana is known as \\"Loik Samoing Ram\\" which was written in 1834 AD by a Buddhist monk named Uttama. It is evident that \\"Loik Samoing Ram\\" is mainly derived from Burmese version as the author of the Mon version stated in his preface that due to the popularity of Burmese version in the capital. However, Mon version also exhibits the connections with Thai, Javanese and Malayan versions and has own unique episodes, not found in Thai, Burmese or Malayan versions.\\"Salient features of Mon Rama story\\" by Toru Ohno Characters The characters of Yama Zatdaw share the same features and characteristics as those in the original story.

Both Wodaabe and other Fulbe see in the Wodaabe the echoes of an earlier pastoralist way of life, of which the Wodaabe are proud and of which urban Fulbe are sometimes critical.Mette Bovin (2001), p.13 The Wodaabe culture is one of the 186 cultures of the standard cross-cultural sample used by anthropologists to compare cultural traits.

A large wooden bed is the most important possession of each family; when camping it is surrounded by some screens. The women also carry calabashes as a status symbol. These calabashes are passed down through the generations, and often provoke rivalry between women. The Wodaabe mostly live on milk and ground millet, as well as yogurt, sweet tea and occasionally the meat of a goat or sheep. Religion, morals and customs Wodaabe religion is largely Islamic (mixed with pre-Islamic beliefs). Although there are varying degrees of orthodoxy exhibited, most adhere to at least some of the basic requirements of the religion. Islam became a religion of importance among Wodaabe peoples during the 16th century when the scholar al-Maghili preached the teachings of Muhammad to the elite of northern Nigeria. Al-Maghili was responsible for converting the ruling classes among Hausa, Fulani, and Tuareg peoples in the region. The code of behavior of the Wodaabe emphasizes reserve and modesty (semteende), patience and fortitude (munyal), care and forethought (hakkilo), and loyalty (amana). They also place great emphasis on beauty and charm.Beckwith, Carol, and Angela Fisher. African Ceremonies. New York: Harry N Abrams, 1999.

Biography  Born in New York City and raised in Hollywood, California, George O'Hara began his acting career under contract as a performer for early Hollywood director Mack Sennett. Sennett was immediately charmed by the handsome, cleft-chinned young actor and saw O'Hara as a potentially popular matinee idol. O'Hara's acting career received an early boost when Sennett cast the young actor in the commercially successful 1920 romantic film Love, Honor, and Behave opposite the popular silent film actress Marie Prevost. In 1921, O'Hara began working behind the camera with Sennett's tutelage. He was credited as an associate producer in the Ben Turpin film A Small Town Idol and later worked as a continuity and title writer throughout the 1920s in the film industry as well as continuing his successful acting career. George O'Hara was most popular with the public when starring in two-reel action and adventure serials of the 1920s, such as The Pacemakers and Casey of the Coast Guard. In his most popular serial, Fighting Blood, O'Hara was cast as a boxer; A role well-suited to O'Hara, who in his free time was a boxing afficienado and moderately successful in the amateur lightweight division of the sport. Throughout the 1920s, O'Hara continued working as an actor and became a quite popular matinee idol. He costarred with John Barrymore and Dolores Costello in a silent film adaptation of Moby-Dick called The Sea Beast playing Barrymore's evil half-brother; O'Hara was aptly cast as he bore a resemblance to the legendary actor. With the advent of sound films however, the film studios began to heavily promote a new crop of actors and many of the formerly popular actors of the silent era (including O'Hara) found it increasingly difficult to find work. O'Hara quietly faded into an early retirement in the early 1930s but began trying to rebuild his career later in the decade by taking bit parts, most notably as the role of a clerk in the 1940 John Ford directed film adaptation of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. O'Hara never again achieved the success he had attained in his early career and spent the next several decades playing as an extra in often uncredited roles. O'Hara died of cancer in Los Angeles, California in 1966.

A multi-day backpacking trail in the northern part of the park, the Nipissing-North Arm Orienteering Trail, is used for orienteering. This wilderness trail is uncleared and only minimally marked. The park contains a striking landscape of windswept pines clinging to smooth granite-striped rocks, towering cliffs, narrow bays and inlets. On a typical visit to the park one might see wildlife common to the Near-North area of Ontario such as snapping turtles, loons, bears, great blue herons and otters but also wildlife typical of the great lakes such as cormorants, eagles, and ducks. \\"Massasauga\\" means \\"mouth of the river\\" in Ojibwe. The name also refers to the massasauga rattlesnake, which is found in the area.

In the U.S. Senate, Gillette was elected, re-elected, defeated, elected again, and defeated again. Personal background Born in Cherokee, Iowa, he attended public school and graduated from Drake University Law School in Des Moines in 1900. He was admitted to the bar in 1900 and commenced practice in Cherokee. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he served as a sergeant in the Fifty-second Iowa Regiment in the United States Army, but never saw combat.Oral History of Stewart McClure, Part 1 (Service on Gillette Senate Staff), at 5. He volunteered to fight against the British in Africa in the Boer War, but was turned down. Returning to Iowa, he engaged in agricultural pursuits and was the city attorney of Cherokee in 1906‚Äì1907. He became the prosecuting attorney of Cherokee County from 1907 to 1909 and a member of the Iowa State Senate from 1912 to 1916. During the First World War, he served as a captain in the United States Army. He ran unsuccessfully for Iowa State Auditor in 1918, and returned to Cherokee to farm.Mark R. Finlay, \\"Guy Mark Gillette,\\" in The Biographical Dictionary of Iowa, p. 188 (2008). Service in the U.S. House, then U.S. Senate (1933‚Äì1945) In 1932, in the Roosevelt landslide, he was elected as a Democrat to represent Iowa's 9th congressional district, in heavily Republican northwest Iowa. He was re-elected in 1934, and served nearly all of that term. He resigned upon his election to the United States Senate on November 3, 1936 to serve out the remainder of the term of Senator Richard Louis Murphy, who had died in an auto accident. Nearly two years remained in Murphy's term, which would end January 3, 1939. Although he generally supported the New Deal, he opposed the new wage and hours bill, a new farm bill, and aspects of the Social Security system. In 1938 the Roosevelt Administration targeted Gillette for replacement because of Gillette's vote against Roosevelt's plan to expand the Supreme Court and other positions.\\"Iowa's Microcosm,\\" Time Magazine, 1938-06-13. He nevertheless defeated Roosevelt's choice for the Democratic nomination, Congressman Otha D. Wearin, and was narrowly elected to his first full Senate term. During that term, his conflicts with the Roosevelt Administration expanded, on topics as diverse as the terms of the Neutrality Act,\\"Rebels and Ripsnorters,\\" Time Magazine, 1939-7-24. Roosevelt's pursuit of third and fourth terms, and choices for judgeships.\\"SEC seat warming,\\" Time Magazine, 1941-04-21. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (where, coincidentally, Gillette's brother Captain Claude Gillette managed the Navy yard), Gillette became \\"more of an internationalist.\\" Nevertheless, he used his chairmanship on a Senate subcommittee to aggressively challenge the Roosevelt Administration's failure to prepare for the prospect of a Japanese seizure of the source of the nation's rubber imports by developing synthetic farm-based alternatives. In April 1943 a confidential analysis by British scholar Isaiah Berlin of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the British Foreign Office succinctly characterized Gillette: :[He] resembles Van Nuys in that he is a typical Mid-Western Senator with a moderately steady Isolationist voting record, although he is not an articulate opponent of the Administration's policy. Unlike Van Nuys, he is a supporter of reciprocal trade pacts but shares his suspicion of the President. A simple, confused, but very honest Presbyterian of considerable character, he views the corn interest, which he represents, with an almost religious devotion. He leads the Senate Lobby interested in producing synthetic rubber out of corn, and coming from the Republican corn belt, is virtually a Republican in sentiment and conduct. He is not at all anti-British, but as isolationist as his general environment. His speeches in Congress take the form of thinking aloud. On foreign policy he is not a bigoted anti-Rooseveltite but is exceedingly uncertain. Like several others who had opposed Roosevelt's efforts to aid Great Britain before Pearl Harbor but faced wartime elections, Gillette lost his next race, in 1944, to Iowa Governor and Republican Bourke B. Hickenlooper.\\" The New Senate,\\" Time Magazine, 1944-11-13. Between terms Within days of Gillette's first defeat, Roosevelt nominated him as the chairman of the three-member Surplus Property Board, prompting the Washington Post and a Life Magazine editorial to quip that the president was confusing the problem of surplus property with the problem of surplus politicians.Editorial, \\"Surplus Property,\\" Life Magazine, 1944-12-18 at p. 20 He took an early dislike to the job,\\"Inside Washington,\\" Valparaiso Vidette- Messenger, 1945-04-16 at p. 7. and complained that he was often outvoted by the two other members.\\"Under the Capitol Dome,\\" Ames Daily Tribune, 1945-07-20 at p. 4. After resigning from the Surplus Board in May 1945, he became president of the American League for a Free Palestine, serving until the Committee's work ended with the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. Return to the Senate (1949‚Äì1955) He made a political comeback in 1948, unseating former governor George A. Wilson from Iowa's other Senate seat. In 1951 his Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections conducted an investigation of Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy's campaign practices. Gillette served until January 3, 1955, after his own bid for re-election was thwarted by U.S. Representative Thomas E. Martin of Iowa City. His defeat was considered an upset because it conflicted with polls.\\"Gillette is Upset, GOP wins State,\\" Waterloo Daily Courier, 1954-11-03, at 1-2. For the last time, it left every Iowa seat in Congress in Republican hands. From 1951 onwards Senator Gillette was one of the first to call for an North Atlantic Assembly. Post-Senate Following his second defeat, Gillette initially remained on Capitol Hill, serving as counsel with the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee (from 1955 to 1956) and the Senate Judiciary Committee (from 1956 to 1961). He retired and resided in Cherokee until his death at age 94 on March 3, 1973, and was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery.

His father was also called Ptolemy and was a brother of Antigonus. Ptolemy, the nephew, was Antigonus's right-hand-man until his son Demetrius took on a more prominent role. He is first mentioned as being present with his uncle at the siege of Nora in 319 BC, when he was given up to Eumenes as a hostage for the safety of the latter during a conference with Antigonus. A few years later we find him entrusted by his uncle with commands of importance. In 315 BC, when Antigonus moved against the coalition of Diadochi formed against him, he placed Ptolemy at the head of an army which was marched to Asia Minor against the generals of Cassander. The young general successfully carried out his mission, relieving Amisus, which was besieged by Asclepiodorus, and recovered the whole satrapy of Cappadocia; after which he advanced into Bithynia, compelling king Zipoites to join Antigonus. Upon his approach and occupation of Ionia, Seleucus withdrew from that territory. He made an alliance with Dionysius the tyrant of Heraclea, cemented by marrying the tyrant's daughter.Memnon, History of Heraclea, F. 4, 6. In the latter part of that year, Ptolemy next threatened Caria, which was defended for a time by Myrmidon, a mercenary in service to Ptolemaic Egypt. In the following year (313 BC) Ptolemy was able to strike a decisive blow in that quarter against Eupolemus, a general of Cassander, whom he surprised and totally defeated. Ptolemy had been attending his father's funeral when his opponent Assander (satrap of Karia) received reinforcements from his ally Cassander and decided to strike at Ptolemy's troops who were without their commander and scattered around Karia in winter quarters. He sent Eupolemus with 8,000 foot and 200 horse to take Ptolemy's forces by surprise. Ptolemy somehow got word of the surprise attack and ambushed Eupolemus, capturing his entire force.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, xix. 68. In the summer of 313 BC, the arrival of Antigonus himself gave a decided preponderance to his arms in Anatolia, and Ptolemy, after rendering active assistance in the sieges of Kaunos and Iasus, was sent with a considerable army to Greece to carry on the war there against Cassander. His successes were at first rapid: he drove out the garrisons of his adversary from Chalcis and Oropus, invaded Attica, where he compelled Athens' tyrant Demetrius Phalereus to make overtures of submission, and then carried his arms triumphantly through Boeotia, Phocis, and Locris. Wherever he went, he expelled Cassander's garrisons, and proclaimed the liberty and independence of the cities. He then directed his armies to the Peloponnese, where the authority of Antigonus had been endangered by the recent defection of his general Telesphorus another nephew of Antigonus's. Ptolemy succeeded in bringing Teleshorus back into the fold. Here he appears to have remained till the peace of 311 suspended hostilities in that region. He is thought to have considered that his services had not met with their due reward from Antigonus; and therefore, when in 310 BC Cassander and Ptolemy were preparing to renew the war, Ptolemy suddenly abandoned the cause of his uncle and concluded a treaty with Cassander and Ptolemy. His ambition may have been to establish himself in the chief command in the Peloponnese: but the reconciliation of Polyperchon with Cassander must have frustrated this: and on the arrival of Ptolemy with a fleet at Cos, Ptolemy repaired from Chalcis to join him. He was received at first with the utmost favour, but soon gave offence to his new patron by his intrigues and ambitious demonstrations, and was in consequence thrown into prison and compelled to put an end to his life by poison, 309 BC.

Conn Company, directed by Phil Patton. It is also the name of the film's main character, played by Betty Luster. The short was intended to be shown in classrooms and school assemblies to advertise Conn's line of musical instruments for American school bands. It fell into obscurity until it was satirized in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 that first aired on November 30, 1991, after which it was celebrated as a prime example of period kitsch. Titular character Mr. B Natural is an androgynous figure, a \\"hep pixie\\" who is meant to embody the \\"spirit of fun in music\\". In this capacity, the character inspires children to take up band instruments. The name is a pun on the musical notation B‚ôÆ (B natural), as the character explains: \\"that's what your feelings of music are, as natural as you can be.\\" The nickname of Billy Eckstine, a highly popular singer and bandleader at the time, was \\"Mr. B.\\" The character also acts as a kind of nascent brand mascot for C.G. Conn musical instruments, though Mr. B Natural made no appearances for the company beyond the one film. Conn provided details about the film in the Spring 1957 issue of their magazine, The Baton, distributed to public school music teachers: \\"Mr. B Natural is the spirit of music in everyone...a sort of LepreCONN who is always no more than an inch away from the fingertips of anyone. Mr. B has a code however, that prohibits him from showing himself for anyone unless he reaches out and calls for the spirit of music. In full color, Mr. B Natural entertainingly answers the call of Buzz, a shy, reticent teen-ager and for twenty-six minutes and forty seconds explains how music and playing a musical instrument will help develop posture, breathing, self-confidence, coordination and in general a young person's character. Mr. B gives both youthful and adult audiences ease to take instruction in the values of music. The Film is being made available by the Band Instrument Division of Conn through Conn dealers everywhere.\\" In captions for the productions photos included in the three-page essay, the title character is consistently referred to as \\"he\\", an indication that Conn intended Mr. B to be of the male gender. However, in an instance of reverse- gender casting similar to the casting of Mary Martin as Peter Pan (\\"Mary Martin syndrome\\" as Kevin Murphy said when writing about his experiences with the short film), the role was cast with an actress, Betty Luster, who had been a television musical variety star only a few years before. Plot The action opens upon the musical staff in which Mr. B Natural lives. Mr. B addresses the audience directly, in an effort to appear welcoming, and explains what it means to be a spirit of music. Awaiting a person's call for help, Mr. B evinces sympathy and concern for lonely junior high student Buzz Turner. Buzz shows an interest in music like the more popular kids at school, but is so shy that he makes excuses to not attend a dance, even when a girl directly invites him. Dejected, Buzz returns home and puts on a record. This magically summons Mr. B into the adolescent boy's bedroom, whereupon the pixie uses magic, music and dance to convince Buzz to take up playing the trumpet. In visiting the music dealership, Buzz's parents are reassured by the salesman that buying a trumpet is \\"simply making a small investment in your son's lifetime personality.\\" When Buzz mentions that he didn't care what make his new horn would be, he is reproached by Mr. B Natural, and is treated to a detailed description of the C. G. Conn factory and laboratories. Through the gift of music and the help of his mysterious friend, Buzz finds the confidence and assertiveness he needs to try out for the school band, impress girls, and play solo at concerts and school dances. Cast * Betty Luster as Mr. B Natural :Betty Luster performed on the operatic stage in the late 1940s, was a regular on the 1951 NBC television variety show Seven at Eleven, and in 1955 appeared on Broadway. Mr. B Natural is her last known role. * Bruce Podewell as Buzz Turner. \\"Buzz\\" is Podewell's own nickname, and he had appeared under that name on Watch Mr. Wizard in 1951. He was a professor of theater and dance at Tulane University for nearly 40 years, until his death in March 2013. * James Andelin as Band instructor (uncredited) * Lester Podewell as Mr. Turner (Buzz's father) (uncredited) * Paul E. RichardsHe was then Conn's Band Instrument sales manager, described in the Spring 1957 issue of Conn's The Baton as being \\"responsible for the over-all production of the film.\\" The film credits Richards as \\"technical advisor\\", though he is listed as cast by Prelinger in Sponsored Films. Production Mr. B Natural was produced by Kling Film Productions, an industrial film producer based out of Chicago, Illinois. The film's sponsor, C.G. Conn, was introducing its new line of \\"Connstellation\\" brass instruments in the mid-1950s, which may explain the emphasis on these instruments in the storyline. Shooting took place in 1956, on 16mm in Technicolor. Which sound stages were used for the production is not known, but the school grounds of Waukegan Elementary School in Illinois and Miami Sr. High School in Florida were used for location shots. Footage of workers at a C.G. Conn plant also appears. =Crew= * Phil Patton, director :Patton's only other known credit was for directing the American dubs and footage of the Soviet children's classic The Snow Queen in 1959. * Marvin David, writer * Bernie Saber, music * David Savitt, cinematographer * Arthur Ellis, editor Mystery Science Theater 3000Rediscovery= In 1991, HBO sought content for its new network, Comedy Central, and employed \\"ephemeral film\\" expert Rick Prelinger to locate amusing vintage footage. Mr. B Natural was not held in Prelinger's collection, but was licensed for use in Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) from Streamline Film Archives, now F.I.L.M. Archives. F.I.L.M. Archives is the only known holder of this film print today, archived as reel #1133B. =Spoof= Mr. B Natural was featured on MST3K as part of episode #319, preceding the film War of the Colossal Beast, which first aired November 30, 1991. It is celebrated by fans and critics alike as one of the most memorable shorts ever satirized by the show. In MST3K's revisiting of the short, Joel Robinson and the bots mock Mr. B's gender ambiguity and seemingly sinister interest in Buzz. They also pick up on a candid comment of Mr. B Natural, \\"don't be too sure I wasn't in the Garden with Mr. and Mrs. Adam,\\" making the obvious connection that Adam and Eve's only companion in Eden mentioned in the Genesis story was the serpent. When Mr. B Natural starts a series of bizarre dances, Crow moans \\"Oh, my God, please say this isn't happening!\\" while Tom intones \\"Ladies and gentlemen, please accept our sincere apologies for all of this.\\" Following the short, Joel moderates a mock-serious debate between Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo as to whether Mr. B Natural is a man or a woman. At the end of the film, the trio sing ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really white‚Äù to the tune of the band playing. =Running joke= The short was later referenced many times during the show's run. Examples include: *In Episode #420, The Human Duplicators, as a lithe woman walks down a stairway and across a room, Crow says in a higher pitched voice, \\"Knew your father, I did\\", a line uttered by Mr. B Natural. * In Episode #421, Joel, to cheer him up after a particularly bad movie (Monster A-Go-Go), dressed Tom up as a \\"Happy King\\", quoting Mr. B and pronouncing it the same oddly chipper way the character did. * In Episode #514, Teen-Age Strangler, as a character walks past several high school lockers, Crow declares nervously, \\"Mr. B Natural's in one of those lockers.\\" * During the short Design for Dreaming in Episode #524, Crow reacts to the main actress's perky dancing by declaring \\"It's a salute to Mr. B Natural!\\" * In one scene in #703, Deathstalker and the Warriors from Hell, Deathstalker gingerly leaps out of the way of a sword, to which Crow exclaims, \\"I'm Mr. B Natural!\\" Mr. B was recreated by Bridget Jones in the live broadcast \\"Turkey Day\\" host segments of episode #701T Night of the Blood Beast, on November 23, 1995. Jones's Mr. B has arrived on the show to celebrate Thanksgiving, but becomes the focus of the unwelcome affections of another guest, a drunken Jack Perkins, played by Jones' real-life husband Michael J. Nelson. RiffTrax In 2013, RiffTrax, a comedy website that features three of the stars of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (Michael J. Nelson, Bill Corbett, and Kevin Murphy), wrote and performed an all-new commentary track for Mr. B Natural. The resulting film with commentary track was released to some sponsors of their Kickstarter crowd-funded campaign.http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rifftrax/rifftrax-wants-to-riff- twilight-live-in-theaters-n Unlike the MST3K version, the RiffTrax version is a nearly unedited 26 minutes, 7 seconds.

The series ran for two seasons between September 1979 and April 1981, and the feature-length pilot episode for the series was released as a theatrical film before the series aired. The film and series were developed by Glen A. Larson and Leslie Stevens, based on the character Buck Rogers created in 1928 by Philip Francis Nowlan that had previously been featured in comic strips, novellas, a serial film, and on television and radio. Concept and broadcast history Inspired by the success of Star Wars, Universal began developing Buck Rogers for television, spearheaded by Glen A. Larson, who had a production deal with the studio. Production began in 1978. Initially, Larson and Universal had planned on making a series of Buck Rogers TV movies for NBC. The pilot for Larson's other science-fiction series, Battlestar Galactica (1978), had been released theatrically in some countries and in key locations in North America and had done well at the box office. Universal then opted to release the first Buck Rogers TV movie theatrically on March 30, 1979. Good box-office returns led NBC to commission a weekly series, which began on September 20, 1979, with a slightly modified version of the theatrical release. The production recycled many of the props, effects shots, and costumes from Battlestar Galactica, which was still in production at the time the pilot for Buck Rogers was being filmed. For example, the \\"landram\\" vehicle was made for the Galactica series, and the control sticks used in the Terran starfighters in the pilot movie were the same as those used in Galactica's Viper craft. The Terran starfighters were also concept designer Ralph McQuarrie's original vision of the Colonial Vipers. The new series centered on Captain William Anthony \\"Buck\\" Rogers (played by Gil Gerard), a NASA/USAF pilot who commands Ranger 3, a spacecraft that is launched in May 1987. Due to a life-support malfunction, Buck is accidentally frozen for 504 years before his spacecraft is discovered adrift in the year 2491. The combination of gases that froze his body coincidentally comes close to the formula commonly used in the 25th century for cryopreservation, and his rescuers are able to revive him. He learns that civilization on Earth was rebuilt following a devastating nuclear war (later established as occurring on November 22, 1987), and is now under the protection of the Earth Defense Directorate. The series followed him as he tried (not always successfully) to fit into 25th-century culture. As no traceable personal records of him remained, he was uniquely placed, due to his pilot and combat skills and personal ingenuity, to help Earth Defense foil assorted evil plots to conquer the planet. In many respects, this version of Buck Rogers was more similar to James Bond or Steve Austin than Nowlan's original character, and Buck would often go undercover on various covert missions. Buck is aided in his adventures by his friend and sometimes romantic interest, Colonel Wilma Deering (played by Erin Gray), a high-ranking officer and starfighter pilot. He is also assisted by Twiki, a small robot or \\"ambuquad\\", as they were known. Twiki was played mainly by Felix Silla and voiced mainly by Mel Blanc (who had previously voiced Daffy Duck as Duck Dodgers in spoofs of the early Buck Rogers and other science-fiction serials) using a gruff voice very similar to the one he used for Barnyard Dawg. Twiki became Buck's comic sidekick and communicated with an electronic noise that sounded like \\"biddi-biddi-biddi\\", but also spoke English (usually after saying \\"biddi-biddi-biddi-biddi\\" for several seconds). Twiki's English usually consisted of 20th century slang that he learned from Buck. Also aiding Buck was Dr. Theopolis or \\"Theo\\" (voiced by Eric Server), a sentient computer in the shape of a disk about 9 inches wide with an illuminated face. He was capable of understanding Twiki's electronic language, and was often carried around by him. Theo was a member of Earth's \\"computer council\\" and one of the planet's scientific leaders. During the first season, Buck and Wilma took their orders from Dr. Elias Huer, played by Tim O'Connor, the head of the Defense Directorate. Some episodes suggested Huer was the leader of the entire planet, though this was never made completely clear. The series' chief villain (at least in the first season) was Princess Ardala (played by Pamela Hensley), whose goal was to conquer the Earth while making Buck her consort. She was aided by her henchman Kane (played in the pilot film by Henry Silva and in the series by Michael Ansara). All of these characters were featured in the original comic strip except for Dr. Theopolis and Twiki (whose closest counterpart in earlier versions would likely be Buck's human sidekick, Buddy Wade). Kane (or Killer Kane as he was then known) was also featured in the 1939 film serial and was actually the chief villain himself, rather than Ardala's henchman (Ardala did not appear in the film serial). The pilot film depicted human civilization as fairly insular, with an invisible defense shield that surrounded the entire planet, protecting it from invaders. Civilization was restricted to a few cities; the main city seen in the pilot and weekly series was New Chicago, which was also known as the Inner City. Travel beyond the Inner City was hazardous, as much of the planet was said to be a radioactive wasteland inhabited by violent mutants (as Buck discovered when he visited the derelict remains of old Chicago). Film The first made- for-TV movie was released theatrically in March 1979 as Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. The film made $21 million at the North American box office, prompting Universal to move ahead with a weekly series later that year. The film, which was also released internationally, featured all of the main protagonist characters who would appear in the weekly series, and also included Princess Ardala of the planet Draconia, and her henchman, Kane. Series The theatrical film also served as a pilot and two-part first episode for the series, entitled \\"Awakening\\". Several scenes were edited, some to remove the more adult dialogue in the film including when Buck refers to Wilma as \\"ballsy\\", and later when he says \\"shit\\", and a scene in which Buck kills Ardala's henchman, Tigerman, was edited to allow the character to return in later episodes. Also, some new and extended scenes were added for the TV version, including several scenes within Buck's new apartment, which was the setting for a new final scene in which Dr. Huer and Wilma try to persuade Buck to join the Defense Directorate. This scene ends with Buck actually declining their offer, though he opts to join them in an unofficial capacity by the first episode of the series proper, \\"Planet of the Slave Girls\\". Including the two-part pilot episode, the first season comprised 24 episodes, with four of the stories being two-parters. The tone of the series was lighter than the pilot movie, and showed a more positive picture of future Earth. The Inner City was now known as New Chicago, and it was established that human civilization had spread once again across the planet, and also to the stars. After the movie pilot, no reference to barren radioactive wastelands was made, and in several episodes, the world outside is shown as lush and green. The mutants seen in the pilot film were no longer seen, and Buck sometimes ventured outside New Chicago with no hazards encountered. As opposed to the isolationist planet seen in the film, Earth no longer has an invisible defense shield surrounding it and is shown to be the center of an interstellar human- dominated government, sometimes called \\"the Federation\\" or \\"the Alliance\\", with its capital at New Chicago. During the first season, references were also made to other \\"new\\" Earth cities such as New Detroit, New Manhattan, New Phoenix, New Tulsa, Boston Complex, and New London. A \\"City-on-the-Sea\\" was also seen, mentioned as being the former New Orleans. Wilma Deering and Dr. Huer were the only Defense Directorate personnel seen in every episode, though several others were seen in individual episodes. Most Defense Directorate personnel regard Buck as being at least an 'honorary' captain, in reference to his 20th-century U.S. military rank, but his membership in Earth's defense forces is unofficial. Nevertheless, Buck often flies with the fighter squadrons, and uses his 20th-century U.S. Air Force background to assist in their training. Dr. Huer regularly meets, greets, and otherwise deals with representatives of other sovereign powers. Huer was also seen in military uniform (at formal occasions), thus indicating he is or was a member of the military. Travel between the stars was accomplished with the use of \\"stargates\\": artificially created portals in space (similar in appearance to wormholes), but referred to as \\"warp\\" travel on at least one occasion by Wilma Deering. Stargates appear as a diamond-shaped quartet of brilliant lights in space that shimmer when a vessel is making transit. Some people find the transit through a stargate to be physically unpleasant (transit resembling a \\"spinning\\" of the spacecraft). Buck's dislike of them is shown in part one of the episode \\"Planet of the Slave Girls\\" and again in part two of the episode \\"The Plot to Kill a City\\". To portray futuristic-looking buildings on Earth, the show used stock shots of the remaining national pavilions of Expo 67, particularly the French and British pavilions as well as shots of the Bonaventure Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. Juanin Clay, who played Major Marla Landers in the first-season episode \\"Vegas in Space\\", was originally cast as Wilma for the TV series (Erin Gray had initially opted not to return after the pilot film, but she later changed her mind). A relationship between Buck and Wilma was hinted at, but rarely expanded upon, and in the first season, Buck was involved (to some degree) with a different woman almost every week. Producers demanded that Wilma have blonde hair and dye jobs were needed to lighten Erin Gray's brunette locks. During the final episodes of the first season, Gray was allowed to return to her natural hair color, and Wilma was dark-haired throughout season 2. Buck's best-known enemy during the first season was Princess Ardala, played by Pamela Hensley, whose desire was to conquer and possess both Earth and Buck himself. She appeared in four separate stories, including the pilot film, two single episodes (\\"Escape from Wedded Bliss\\" and \\"Ardala Returns\\"), and the two-part first-season finale (\\"Flight of the War Witch\\"). The opening title sequence for the series included stock footage from the Apollo 4 and Apollo 6 launches. The series had an overall budget of $800,000 per hour of air time, according to Starlog issue #32 (March 1980). Former actor Jock Gaynor served as producer for 20 episodes. Although reasonably popular with viewers, the first season failed to receive much critical acclaim. One vocal critic of the series was Gerard himself, who pushed for more serious storytelling and often clashed with the producers and the network (NBC) over the show's tone and handling. He would often arbitrarily refuse to perform some of the more comical lines in the scripts he was given, complaining that Buck was just a \\"wise-ass\\" who was making one joke after another, and would often rewrite scripts himself to place more emphasis on his own character at the expense of others (for example, in the episode \\"Escape From Wedded Bliss\\", the script originally called for Buck to be rescued from the Draconians at the end by Wilma, but Gerard vetoed the idea). Unhappy with the show's direction, Gerard became increasingly difficult to work with, which led to tensions on set. A meeting between him and writers/script editors Anne Collins and Alan Brennert went badly and they quit the show midway through the first season. Gerard himself was threatened with legal action by the network if he continued to cause problems and hinder the production. In the November 1980 issue of Starlog, Gerard even said he had hoped the series would not be picked up for a second season because he had no wish to go through another season like the first one. =Second season= Production of the second season was delayed by several months due to an actors' strike. When production resumed in the fall of 1980, the series had a new set of producers (headed by John Mantley, who had primarily worked on television westerns) and the format of the series was changed. Instead of defending the Earth from external threats, Buck, Wilma and Twiki were now a part of a crew aboard an Earth spaceship called the Searcher on a mission to seek out the lost \\"tribes\\" of humanity who had scattered in the five centuries since Earth's 20th-century nuclear war, a theme present in Glen A. Larson's previous science-fiction television series, Battlestar Galactica. Another notable change in the second season was the disappearance of many of the regular characters of the first season, such as Dr. Huer, Dr. Theopolis, Princess Ardala, and Kane. However, several new characters were added: * Admiral Efram Asimov (Jay Garner), commander of the Searcher and a descendant of the famous science fiction author Isaac Asimov. * Hawk (Thom Christopher), an alien character who represents the last of the nearly extinct bird people. * Dr. Goodfellow (Wilfrid Hyde-White), an elderly scientist with insatiable curiosity. * Crichton (voiced by Jeff David), a snobbish robot built by Goodfellow, but who finds it difficult to believe that lowly humans could have built him. The character of Wilma Deering was softened in the second season as the producers attempted to tone down the militaristic \\"Colonel Deering\\" image (who often gave Buck orders) and to make her more feminine. Another change in the second season was the sound of Twiki's voice. Mel Blanc left the series after the end of the first season and another actor, Bob Elyea, supplied Twiki's voice. Blanc returned for the final six episodes of the second season, though no explanation was given for the change in Twiki's voice. The substance of the storylines also changed in the second season. Less emphasis was placed on militaristic ideals and, with a few exceptions, Gerard scaled back the humor in the second season in favor of more serious episodes (with the final episode of the series ending on a somber note as a result). Buck's and Wilma's relationship became slightly more romantic during the second year, though most romantic activity was implied and took place off-screen. Moreover, the second season deals with more serious concepts such as evolution, ecology, racism, pollution, war, nuclear power, identity, the self, and religion. It also draws on mythology as exemplified by Hawk's people, who are variants on the bird people found in mythologies around the world and makes special reference to the moai of Easter Island. An episode also included a story about mythical satyr creatures. As well as its parallels to Larson's previous television series Battlestar Galactica, the second season is similar in theme to Star Trek, with the Searcher roaming through space much like the USS Enterprise had, Buck being the maverick explorer true to the style of Captain James T. Kirk, and the serious, rather stoic Hawk being a revamped version of Mr. Spock. Even Wilma, to some extent, had been remodeled after Lt. Uhura from Star Trek, often dressed in a miniskirt uniform and regularly sitting at a communications console on the bridge of the Searcher. Although initially pleased with the change in personnel, Gerard again became unhappy with the show. At the time of production, Gerard spoke highly of new showrunner John Mantley, but in a retrospective article in the mid-1990s, he was more critical of him and the Star Trek-esque style of the second season. Ratings dropped significantly after the season premiere and, coupled with an increasingly problematic star, NBC canceled the series at the end of an 11-episode strike- abbreviated season. No finale storyline was produced, with the final episode broadcast being a normal standalone episode.

Joseph Wiseman also appeared in the episode \\"Vegas In Space\\" playing the character Morphus, and was also briefly seen in the theatrical version of the pilot as Emperor Draco (Princess Ardala's father), but his appearance was edited out of the television version. Several actors who had played villains in the 1960s Batman television series also guest-starred, including Cesar Romero, Frank Gorshin, Roddy McDowall, and Julie Newmar. EpisodesInternational broadcast= The series was originally shown in the UK by ITV, beginning in late August 1980, with the feature-length two-part episode \\"Planet of the Slave Girls\\" (the pilot film, which had been released theatrically in Britain in summer 1979, was not actually shown on British television until 1982). ITV broadcast Buck Rogers in an early Saturday evening slot, where it competed against, and beat, the BBC's long-running science fiction series Doctor Who, which started its 18th season on the same day.TV listings for Saturday 30 August 1980, available from BBC Genome (http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/) for BBC and various newspaper online archives for ITV. As a similar effect had occurred a few years earlier when several ITV stations screened Man from Atlantis against Doctor Who; this prompted the BBC to move Doctor Who to a new weekday slot for its next season in 1982, though Buck Rogers had been cancelled in the US by then. The BBC would repeat the Buck Rogers series on BBC Two in 1989 and again in 1995-96. Forces TV later repeated the show several times from November 2018. The series also aired in Canada on CTV, on the same day and time as the NBC airings. Reception Contemporary assessments of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century were generally mixed. In his book Sci-Fi TV from Twilight Zone to Deep Space Nine, writer James Van Hise claimed the show's scripts \\"just never took advantage of what they had at hand\\" and criticized Larson's version of Buck Rogers as a cynical attempt to exploit one of the most loved characters in American popular culture.James Van Hise. Sci-Fi TV from Twilight Zone to Deep Space Nine. New York, Pioneer Books, 1993 John Javna's book The Best of Science Fiction TV included Buck Rogers in the 25th Century on its list of the \\"Worst Science Fiction Shows of All Time\\" (along with The Starlost, Space: 1999 and Manimal).John Javna, The Best of Science Fiction TV: the critics' choice. New York : Harmony Books, 1987. (p. 76-77). Journalist Bill Lengeman also strongly criticized the program, stating \\"the acting is so wooden that Ed Wood himself (no pun intended) would surely have gone weak in the knees and wept openly upon witnessing it.\\" Lengemen also called the Buck Rogers episode \\"Space Rockers\\" the worst episode of TV science fiction he had ever seen.Twiki Love and Space Rock:Ruminations on The Worst SF TV Episode Ever Bill Lengemen, The Internet Review of Science Fiction. January 2007. Retrieved 23 April 2015. On a more positive note, writing in the UK's Observer newspaper in October 1980 (shortly after the series began showing there), journalist Clive James stated \\"the best comic-strip science fiction on at the moment is Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. The hardware looks good and Wilma Deering looks simply sensational, like Wonder Woman with brains.\\" Filmink thought the series did not live up to its pilot, in particular the Buck-Wilma-Ardala triangle, arguing \\"the writers forgot the simple motivations and characterisations. Poor old Wilma was disempowered and shunted to the side where she held Buck‚Äôs water while he had adventures and was thus no threat to Ardala (this was reportedly due to Gil Gerard‚Äôs sooking over the prominence given to Wilma on the show). They also forgot Ardala‚Äôs motivation was to use Buck politically to get an edge on her 23 siblings, not just because she found him hot. Pamela Hensley was everything you wanted in a silly ‚Äò70s sci fi epic and on one hand the producers knew it (they kept bringing her back) but on the other they didn‚Äôt know how to exploit it.\\" Merchandise Two novels were published by Dell Publishing based on this series, both by Addison E. Steele. The first () was a novelization of the pilot film. The second, That Man on Beta (), was adapted from an unproduced episode script. A fumetti book entitled Buck Rogers in the 25th Century was published by Fotonovel Publications in 1979, reproducing the theatrical version of the pilot episode. Gold Key Comics published fourteen issues of a Buck Rogers in the 25th Century comic book based upon the show. The comic book started with issue number two, picking up the numbering from an issue published in 1964 in the style of the old comic strips. Following an adaptation of the pilot film, starting with issue five, new adventures were created in the series continuity. The first three issues (two - four) were reprinted in a \\"Giant Movie Edition\\" which was distributed by Marvel Comics (despite Marvel being a competitor to Gold Key). Artists on the series included Al McWilliams, Frank Bolle and Jos√© Delbo. The comic outlived the series by several months. Issue number ten was never published and this comic book series was cancelled after issue number sixteen. The comic book remained within the continuity of Season 1 and did not feature any characters from Season 2. A strip based on the television series also ran in two publications in the UK: Look-In with 64 weekly installments covering 10 separate adventures between autumn 1980 and early 1982, and TV Tops, which picked up the rights from 1982 for two shorter runs. Both were also based on the format of the first year of the series. Two sets of action figures were produced by Mego, including a 12\\" line and a series of 3.75\\" figures and scaled spaceships. Milton-Bradley produced a Buck Rogers board game and a series of jigsaw puzzles. Other companies produced a variety of tie-ins. Monogram produced 1/48 scale injection-molded model kits of the Earth Defense Directorate Starfighter and the Draconian Marauder from 1979 through 1981. Die-cast toys were released by Corgi, Topps trading cards, and a painted metal lunch box. In 2011, Zica Toys began production of a new line of action figures based on the TV series. These 8\\" action figures are loosely based on Mego designs, but as noted above, Mego did not produce an 8\\" line of Buck Rogers figures, so Zica's line is actually the first line of 8\\", cloth-costumed action figures based on the TV series. Characters planned include Buck Rogers, Hawk, Killer Kane, Tigerman, and Draconian Warriors. The popularity of the TV series led to the revival of the Buck Rogers newspaper strip, daily and Sunday, drawn by Gray Morrow and written by Jim Lawrence. The strip ran from September 9, 1979 to October 26, 1980, and was reprinted in its entirety, with the Sundays in color, in a large trade paperback. Home media The theatrical version of the pilot film was released on VHS, Betamax and Laserdisc in 1981. A handful of the episodes were issued in the US in 1985 by MCA Home Video. Those episodes were \\"Vegas in Space\\", \\"Space Vampire\\", \\"Return of the Righting 69th\\", \\"Unchained Woman\\", \\"A Blast for Buck\\", \\"Happy Birthday Buck\\", \\"Space Rockers\\" and \\"The Guardians\\". In 1987, a single episode, \\"Ardala Returns\\", was released by Goodtimes Home Video, a budget release company. The same MCA tapes were re-released in the late 1990s. In other countries, several series episodes were released on VHS in the late 1990s. Australia released 10 volumes, covering all first season episodes through \\"Space Rockers\\". Universal Studios released the complete series on DVD in North America (Region 1) on November 16, 2004. While it does contain every episode from both seasons, the pilot episode included is the theatrical version and not the TV version. The set contains five double-sided discs. The series was released on DVD in Europe (Region 2), though each season was released separately as opposed to in one set like the Region 1 release. Season 1 was released on November 22, 2004 and season 2 on October 31, 2005, neither of which had the same cover artwork or menu screens as the Region 1 release. Notable differences are the addition of subtitles for various European languages. On January 24, 2012, Universal Studios re-released Season One as a six disc set in North America. The discs were single-sided for this release, in contrast to the double-sided discs released in 2004. Season Two was re-released with single-sided discs on January 8, 2013. As a bonus feature, the second season set includes the television version of the original pilot film, \\"Awakening\\", the first time this version has been released on DVD. On August 17, 2016, Madman Entertainment released the series on Blu-ray to Australia and New Zealand in 1080p. The eight-disc set includes each episode in HD. Extras include theatrical version of the Pilot episode and feature- length version of \\"Flight of the War Witch\\" (both in standard definition), the syndicated two-part version of \\"Journey to Oasis\\" (in HD), textless opening and closing credits sequences, opening credits without voice-over narration, and isolated music and effects audio tracks on each episode. The Blu-ray sets have been released in various other countries since. As of 2019, all the episodes are available for streaming for free on the NBC app. Kino Lorber announced a Region 1 Blu-ray set to be released on November 24, 2020. It includes the movie (in HD for the first time on home media) and seasons 1 & 2\\\\.

It is named after independence activist Jayaprakash Narayan. Patna is classified as a restricted international airport due to its short runway. It is the 14th busiest airport in India, and the annual passenger traffic increased by 30.6 per cent in the year 2018-19. To meet demand, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) is working to expand and modernise airport infrastructure. The airport is currently undergoing ambitious expansion project that is due to be completed in 2021. In addition to this, the AAI has proposed to develop a civil enclave at Bihta Air Force Station to serve as the second airport for Patna. Expansion The runway length at Patna airport is 7,000 feet. Patna airport is sandwiched between the Sanjay Gandhi Jaivik Udyan and Phulwari Sharif railway station. The runway length is 1,938 metres for landing from the east and 1,677 metres for landing from the west. The area of terminal building will be increased from the existing 7,200 square metres to 57,000 square metres. The new terminal building of Patna Airport will be a two-storey structure, equipped with six aerobridges and an apron area to park 14 aircraft at any given time. At present, the airport has the capacity to park only six aircraft. Several existing buildings in and around Patna airport premises, including the Airport Colony and IAS Bhavan, will be demolished for the expansion work. Besides, several utility buildings, including the meteorological centre and Bihar Flying Club, will be shifted and a new ATC tower will be constructed adjacent to Birla Institute of Technology, Patna campus. 13.1 acres of land near the Patna airport will be used for construction of a world-class two-storey terminal building, and in lieu of that 11.35 acre of land in Anisabad, Patna will be transferred to Bihar Government by Airports Authority of India. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has proposed to extend the terminal for sustaining air operations at least till 2035 and handle 6 million passengers per annum. A new terminal building would be constructed and connected to the existing building via skybridge. In addition, the AAI has planned to develop a civil enclave at Bihta Air Force Station, 20 kilometres away from Patna, to cater to larger aircraft. In October 2016, Bihar cabinet approved the Patna master plan which envisages development of a new airport at Bihta. Bihar government is acquiring 126 acres of land for construction of Bihta Airport. In September 2018, Government of India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved for a new terminal building that will be designed by Singapore firm Meinhardt and will be able to handle 4.5 million passengers a year, compared to present 0.7 million in transit. The new terminal will have an area of 65,155 square metres, including a basement area of 18,650 square metres. Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Construction Company Limited has been selected to execute the design. The new terminal building of Patna airport will be complete by October 2022, construction already started in October-November 2018. As of February 2020, two floors of the multi-level parking garage were complete. 45% of work on the cargo complex, technical block, fire block and air traffic control tower have been completed.

Later he became Lieutenant General of the Wehrmacht and of the Waffen-SS, SS- Obergruppenf√ºhrer, and Supreme Ataman of the XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps. In 1947 he was tried for war crimes under Ukase 43 by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, sentenced to death on 16 January 1947 and executed in Lefortovo Prison the same day. He was rehabilitated by a military prosecutor in Moscow in April 1996. In June 2001, however, the reversal of the conviction of Pannwitz was overturned and his conviction was reinstated. Early life Pannwitz was born into a family of Prussian nobility on his father's estate Botzanowitz (today Bodzanowice), Silesia, near Rosenberg (today Olesno), now part of Poland but directly on the German- Russian border of that time. His family was originally from the village of Pannwitz in Lusatia. From the 14th to 16th century the family held the office of Burggraf of Glatz. Aged twelve, he entered the Prussian cadet school in Wahlstatt, near Liegnitz in Silesia, and later the main cadet school at Lichterfelde. Even before outbreak of World War I he was attracted by exhibitions of Cossack units that were organized in the neighboring towns of the Russian Empire. As an officer cadet, Pannwitz upon the outbreak of the First World War joined the Imperial German Army as a volunteer (1st Regiment of Lancers, based at Militsch), in the course of which he was at the age of sixteen promoted to the rank of Leutnant (second lieutenant/cornet) and decorated with the Iron Cross Second Class in the same year (and, a year later, the First Class) for bravery in action. Immediately after the war he fought in the ranks of the Volunteer Corps (Freikorps) against Polish separatists in Silesia and participated in the Kapp Putsch. Wanted as a suspect in the murder of a Social-Democrat, Bernhard Schottl√§nder, in Breslau, he fled to Poland. Under an assumed name, Pannwitz became a leader in the Black Reichswehr in 1923 where he was involved in a number of Feme murders. In the aftermath of the failed K√ºstrin Putsch, Pannwitz fled again to Poland. After spending a year in Hungary, Pannwitz went to Poland in 1926, where he lived and worked as an administrator of farms, at the last in charge of the estates of Princess Radziwill in M≈Çoch√≥w, near Warsaw. When an amnesty was granted in 1931, Pannwitz returned to Germany. He became a Stabsf√ºhrer of the SA in Silesia. In 1934 he commanded an SA cavalry squadron. By cooperating with the Gestapo he played a leading role during the R√∂hm purge in Silesia. For that he was admitted to join the Nazi Party. In 1935 he rejoined the German Army as a Rittmeister (captain) and cavalry squadron commander in the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Angerburg, East Prussia. In 1938, following the Anschluss when Austria became part of Germany, he was transferred to Austria and became detachment commander with the 11th Cavalry Regiment at Stockerau near Vienna, being promoted to the rank of Major at the same time. World War II found him as the commander of the reconnaissance detachment of the 45th Infantry Division in Poland and France. World War II On active service again in World War II, Pannwitz was awarded \\"bars\\" to his previous decorations and in September 1941 was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. He received the Oak Leaves as an Oberst (colonel) a year later for successful military leadership, when he was in command of a battle group covering the southern flank in the battle of Stalingrad. Pannwitz was instrumental in establishing a Cossack force, Cossack Cavalry Brigade, which was formed on 21 April 1943. The unit conducted anti-partisan operations in Ukraine and Belarus, and was then moved to fight against Yugoslav partisans. During punitive operations in Serbia and Croatia, the Cossack regiments under Pannwitz's command committed a number of atrocities against the civilian population including several mass rapes and routine summary executions.Tomasevich 2001, p. 306. Even for von Pannwitz these atrocities exceeded what he perceived as normal. Moreover, in his eyes they threatened discipline and military success. Therefore he issued an order dated 20 October 1943, according to which crimes of that kind would result in the death penalty.War diary 1st Cossack Division, National Archives Microcopy No T-315, Roll 2281, Washington 1965 At the award ceremony in Berlin, when Pannwitz received the \\"Oak Leaves\\" for his Knight's Cross on 15 January 1943, he told Hitler that the official Nazi policies which caused Slavs to be regarded as subhumans (Untermenschen) for strategical reasons were totally wrong. During the summer of 1944 the two brigades were upgraded to become the 1st Cossack Division and 2nd Cossack Cavalry Division. On 25 February 1945 these divisions were combined to become XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps.Tomasevich 2001, p. 305. Because of the respect he showed for his troops and his tendency to attend Russian Orthodox services with them, Pannwitz was very popular with his Cossack troops. Before the end of the war, he was elected Feldataman (German rendering of Supreme Ataman, the highest rank in the Cossack hierarchy and one that was traditionally reserved for the Tsar alone). By the end of the war, the SS took control of all foreign units within the German forces. The Himmler file in the Imperial War Museum contains a record of a conversation which occurred on 26 August 1944 between Himmler, General von Pannwitz, and his Chief of Staff, Colonel H.-J. von Schultz. An agreement was reached that the Cossack division, soon to be the Cossack Corps, was placed under SS administration in terms of replacements and supplies. Both the German cadre and the Cossack troops were to retain their uniforms and their Wehrmacht or Cossack ranks. For the moment Pannwitz refused to enter the SS, arguing: ‚ÄúI have been in the army since I was fifteen. To leave it now would seem to me like desertion.‚Äù Himmler sought to place all Cossack fighting units under von Pannwitz's command. Thus in November 1944 most units were transferred to the Waffen-SS and integrated into the newly formed XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps. By his own request von Pannwitz was discharged from the army on 10 February 1945 and entered the SS in the rank of SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer and lieutenant-general of the Waffen-SS the following day. Aftermath Pannwitz surrendered on 11 May 1945 to British forces (Eighth Army\`s V Corps) near V√∂lkermarkt in Carinthia, Austria, and tried to ensure that his men would remain in the custody of the Western Allies. By mid-May, however, it was obvious that the Cossacks would be handed over to the Soviet Union. Pannwitz was a German national, and under the provisions of the Yalta Conference not subject to repatriation to the Soviet Union. But on 26 May he was deprived of his command and placed under arrest while the forcible loading of the Cossacks into trucks began and continued through the following days. Although many escaped from their camps following these actions, General v. Pannwitz and many of his German officers shared the uncertain fate of the Cossacks, so these Germans surrendered with the Cossacks to Soviet authorities at Judenburg. Execution Pannwitz was executed in Moscow on 16 January 1947, having been convicted by a military tribunal of war crimes in the Soviet Union. Attempted rehabilitation Almost fifty years later, on 23 April 1996, during the Russian presidency of Boris Yeltsin, members of the Pannwitz family petitioned for a posthumous reversal of the 1946 conviction. The Military High Prosecutor in Moscow subsequently determined that Pannwitz was eligible for rehabilitation as a victim of Stalin-era repression. On 28 June 2001, however, rehabilitation was reversed in a ruling that disputed jurisdiction of the 1996 proceedings, and Pannwitz's conviction for military crimes was reinstated.

The name and theme derive from Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 Victorian gothic novel Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  Background  The Jekyll & Hyde restaurants' theme is spooky horror with an emphasis on English Gothic themes, with detailed decorations, set pieces, and actors who roam the restaurant and entertain patrons. Characters include Mr. Aloysius Goole, the wacky chief mortician, Jervis, the hyperactive and high-pitched French butler, charmingly manic Gertrude K. Boom, club demolitions expert, and club spokesperson Dr. Brain. These characters are the guest's link to all of the details of the club's history, and perform membership inductions table side. In addition to the live characters, there are a number of animatronic props, sounds, and special effects which contribute to the overall atmosphere of the club. The animatronic creatures (either pre-recorded or voiced live by the same actors that walk about the restaurant) animate periodically to entertain the guests and wish happy birthdays.Former alt= In addition to its original Greenwich Village location, on 7th Avenue near Bleecker Street, Jekyll and Hyde also operated a larger location on the Avenue of the Americas in Midtown near 57th street. This branch closed and moved to 44th Street, near Times Square in March 2012, which also closed March 2015. The Sixth Avenue facade continued to stand long after its closing, up to its demolition at around 2015. Other locations had been opened in Chicago and Grapevine, Texas (near DFW Airport), but closed due to poor business and the high operating costs of the restaurant.alt= The Jekyll and Hyde Entertainment Group also operate the nearby Slaughtered Lamb Pub on West 4th Street (based on the movie American Werewolf in London), and the Bayville Adventure Park on Long Island.  In popular culture  In the 12th episode of the first season of reality show The Girls Next Door, Hugh Hefner and his girlfriends are shown having dinner at one of the Jekyll & Hyde restaurants. There is an entertainer at the Jekyll and Hyde club named Dr. Mange, who is known to dance to popular music such as Love Shack during the dinner service on Wednesdays.

Directed by Dani Levy, the cast includes Henry H√ºbchen, Hannelore Elsner, Udo Samel, Go≈Çda Tencer and Steffen Groth. Director Dani Levy, himself Jewish, has made an ironic comedy about modern Jewish identity in present-day Germany. Henry H√ºbchen stars as Jaecki Zucker.

But he says he's got nothing to do with \\"that club\\", ever since his mother and his little brother left him behind the Iron Curtain in East Germany when he was young. Therefore when he learns of the death of his mother, he does not care. However he has to care. His younger brother pays him a visit with his family, because according to Jewish tradition, they have to observe the seven-day Shiv'ah period of mourning, and their Mamme's will requires them to reconcile in the presence of the rabbi and the family. If they fail, her assets will be bestowed upon the Jewish community of Berlin, and not them. Most of the scenes were shot at Tegel Airport, Karl-Marx-Allee, Alexanderplatz, Oranienburger Stra√üe and the Jewish Cemetery Wei√üensee in Berlin. The Mayor of Berlin Klaus Wowereit makes a cameo appearance as himself. Polish actress Golda Tencer does not speak German, even though she spoke her own lines fluently. She had the German text written down on small pieces of paper, hidden in her purse. During the movie she can sometimes be seen looking down into her purse. The soundtrack by Niki Reiser is light and jovial, featuring some klezmer music as well.  Overview  The movie was co- funded by the television channels Arte and the WDR. It is one of the very few movies about German Judaism that does not have the Shoah in the centre, but is a comedy about the crazy twists and turns of fate that befall a family that finds itself again. The two Jewish families are more symbolic of the current problems and past tragedies of the division of Germany between East and West, and how the country and its people are struggling to find to each other again. This division affected every German, regardless of their religion. The film depicts in a comic manner the divisions within Judaism between a secularised Jew from the former GDR who has to reconcile himself with his Orthodox brother from the West. The film has been termed \\"an audacious, politically incorrect, self-ironical Jewish comedy\\". It was critically acclaimed in Germany and won a number of awards, most notably the 2005 Deutscher Filmpreis in several categories.

The Year of the Woman was a popular label attached to 1992 after the election of a number of female Senators in the United States. The term has also been used with respect to the 2018 House elections, in which a record 103 women were elected, 90 of whom were Democrats. The hotly contested Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas involving the allegations of Anita Hill raised the question of the dominance of men in the Senate. In 1991, the Senate included two female members, but neither Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas nor Barbara Mikulski of Maryland served on the Judiciary Committee. Reportedly, Washington State senate member Patty Murray decided to run for election after watching these hearings. While Murray set out to raise the necessary funds, two other women several hundred miles to the south in California began work on their own Senate campaigns. As a result, on January 3, 1993, for the first time in American history, California became the first state in the nation to be represented in the Senate by two women. In the 1992 elections, Dianne Feinstein, a former Democratic mayor of San Francisco, running for the balance of an uncompleted term, beat her opponent with a margin of nearly two million votes, while Barbara Boxer‚Äîa 10-year veteran of the U.S. House of Representatives who had joined six of her Democratic women colleagues in a march on the Senate to urge greater attention to Anita Hill's charges‚Äîsolidly won a full term. At a presidential debate at the University of Richmond, President George H. W. Bush was asked when his party might nominate a woman for President. Bush brought up the media's catchphrase at the end of his response, saying \\"This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate. Let's see how they do. I hope a lot of them lose.\\" A week after the election, a popular Washington Post photograph illustrated the situation. Standing with exultant Democratic Majority Leader George Mitchell were not only Murray, Feinstein and Boxer, but also Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, the first black woman elected to the Senate. Never before had four women been elected to the Senate in a single election year. (Five, if Mikulski's successful re-election bid that year is counted.) Within months, another woman senator would join them: Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, who won a special election in June 1993.

He is best known in the United States as the head coach of the New England Patriots of the National Football League during the 1990 season, which ended with a 1‚Äì15 record. For most of Rust's early coaching career, he was an assistant to one of two coaches: Marv Levy or Dick Vermeil. Rust began as an assistant under Levy at the University of New Mexico between 1960 and 1962, before leaving to serve under Dick Vermeil at Stanford University. In 1967, he became the head coach at North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas), a position he held until 1972. North Texas had a 29‚Äì32‚Äì1 record during Rust's tenure. Rust returned to work for Levy in 1973 as defensive coordinator for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. In his three seasons in Montreal, the Alouettes went to two Grey Cup finals, winning in 1974. In 1976, Rust left the Alouettes to become an assistant with Vermeil's Philadelphia Eagles. He served as linebackers coach for two seasons before leaving to take the defensive coordinator position with Levy and the Kansas City Chiefs. After Levy's firing in 1982, Rust became defensive coordinator of the New England Patriots. Head coach Ron Meyer fired Rust midway through the 1984 season, but he was later reinstated (with Meyer himself fired). Rust and the Patriots went to Super Bowl XX (under head coach Raymond Berry) in 1985, but he left the team after the 1987 season. He returned to the Chiefs for the 1988 season, and moved again to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1989. The Patriots hired Rust as head coach in 1990. The team started out well, with a close loss to the Miami Dolphins and an equally close win over the Indianapolis Colts. The bottom quickly fell out, and the Patriots would suffer 14 straight losses, tying the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the most consecutive losses in a single season in NFL history. Many of these losses came in humiliating fashion. They ultimately finished 1-15, the worst record in franchise history.

Early life Giblin was born at Hobart, Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), son of William Giblin, clerk of the registrar of deeds, and his wife Marion, n√©e Falkiner. He was educated first at a school kept by his uncle Robert Giblin and afterwards at Hobart High School.E. M. Dollery, 'Giblin, William Robert (1840 - 1887)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 4, MUP, 1972, pp 243-244. Retrieved 2009-09-23 Leaving school at 13 Giblin was articled to John Roberts, solicitor. Giblin was a great reader with a retentive memory, in 1862 won a prize for the best poem on the conversion of St Paul, and about this time delivered some lectures on literary subjects. In 1864 he was admitted as a barrister and solicitor, entered into partnership with John Dobson and subsequently with one of his sons Henry Dobson. Also in 1864 Giblin was one of the founders of the Hobart Working Men's Club, was elected its president, and was re-elected on several occasions subsequently. Giblin began to interest himself in public life and especially in the proposed railway from Hobart to Launceston. Political career In 1869 Giblin was elected without opposition as member for Hobart Town in the Tasmanian House of Assembly, and in February 1870 became attorney-general in the James Milne Wilson ministry. Wilson resigned in November 1872 and was succeeded by Frederick Innes. In August 1873 Giblin carried a motion of want of confidence but did not desire the premiership, and Alfred Kennerley formed a cabinet with Giblin as his attorney-general. This ministry lasted nearly three years and Giblin was able to bring in some useful legal legislation. In June 1877 Giblin lost his seat at the general election, but he was soon afterwards elected for Wellington and joined the cabinet of Sir Philip Fysh as attorney-general, exchanging that position for the treasurership a few days later. When Fysh left for London in March 1878 Giblin succeeded him as premier and held office until 20 December 1878. The William Crowther government which followed could do little in the conditions of the period, and when it resigned in October 1879 Giblin realised that the only way to get useful work done would be to form a coalition ministry. This he succeeded in doing and he became premier and colonial treasurer on 30 October 1879. His government lasted nearly five years and during that period the finances of the colony were put in order and railways and roads were built. Important work was done although the conservative elements in the Tasmanian Legislative Council succeeded in hampering the government to some extent. In December 1881 Giblin exchanged the position of treasurer for that of attorney-general with John S. Dodds. He represented Tasmania at the intercolonial tariff conference at Sydney in 1881 and at the Sydney federal conference in 1883, and took an important part in the debates. Late life In August 1884, Giblin resigned from the cabinet on account of failing health; on 7 February 1885 he accepted the position of puisne judge of the Supreme Court of Tasmania, and during the absence of the chief justice administered the government in October‚ÄìNovember 1886. Giblin died of heart disease in Hobart on 17 January 1887, aged 46. In 1865, he married Emily Jean Perkins who survived him along with their four sons and three daughters. His second son was the statistician Lyndhurst Giblin.

This effect is due to electron‚Äìelectron interactions, which are not considered in conventional band theory. The bandgap in a Mott insulator exists between bands of like character, such as 3d character, whereas the bandgap in charge transfer insulators exists between anion and cation states,lecture slides such as between O 2p and Ni 3d bands in NiO. History Although the band theory of solids had been very successful in describing various electrical properties of materials, in 1937 Jan Hendrik de Boer and Evert Johannes Willem Verwey pointed out that a variety of transition metal oxides predicted to be conductors by band theory (because they have an odd number of electrons per unit cell) are insulators. Nevill Mott and Rudolf Peierls then (also in 1937) predicted that this anomaly can be explained by including interactions between electrons. In 1949, in particular, Mott proposed a model for NiO as an insulator, where conduction is based on the formula :(Ni2+O2‚àí)2 ‚Üí Ni3+O2‚àí \\\\+ Ni1+O2‚àí. In this situation, the formation of an energy gap preventing conduction can be understood as the competition between the Coulomb potential U between 3d electrons and the transfer integral t of 3d electrons between neighboring atoms (the transfer integral is a part of the tight binding approximation). The total energy gap is then :Egap = U ‚àí 2zt, where z is the number of nearest-neighbor atoms. In general, Mott insulators occur when the repulsive Coulomb potential U is large enough to create an energy gap. One of the simplest theories of Mott insulators is the 1963 Hubbard model. The crossover from a metal to a Mott insulator as U is increased can be predicted within the so-called dynamical mean field theory. Mottness Mottism denotes the additional ingredient, aside from antiferromagnetic ordering, which is necessary to fully describe a Mott Insulator. In other words, we might write: antiferromagnetic order + mottism = Mott insulator. Thus, mottism accounts for all of the properties of Mott insulators that cannot be attributed simply to antiferromagnetism. There are a number of properties of Mott insulators, derived from both experimental and theoretical observations, which cannot be attributed to antiferromagnetic ordering and thus constitute mottism. These properties include: *Spectral weight transfer on the Mott scale *Vanishing of the single particle Green function along a connected surface in momentum space in the first Brillouin zone *Two sign changes of the Hall coefficient as electron doping goes from n=0 to n=2 (band insulators have only one sign change at n=1) *The presence of a charge 2e (with e<0 the charge of an electron) boson at low energies *A pseudogap away from half-filling (n=1) Applications Mott insulators are of growing interest in advanced physics research, and are not yet fully understood. They have applications in thin-film magnetic heterostructures and the strong correlated phenomena in high-temperature superconductivity, for example. This kind of insulator can become a conductor by changing some parameters, which may be composition, pressure, strain, voltage, or magnetic field. The effect is known as a Mott transition and can be used to build smaller field-effect transistors, switches and memory devices than possible with conventional materials.Newns, Dennis (2000). \\"Junction mott transition field effect transistor (JMTFET) and switch for logic and memory applications\\". http://www.google.com/patents/US6121642 See also * Dynamical mean field theory * Electronic band structure * Hubbard model * Metal‚Äìinsulator transition * Mott criterion * Tight-binding approximation * Variable-range hopping (Mott) NotesReferences  Category:Correlated electrons Category:Quantum phases ","title":"Mott insulator"},{"id":"2740956","text":"Salavan (‡∫™‡∫≤‡∫•‡∫∞‡∫ß‡∫±‡∫ô) is the capital of Salavan Province in southern Laos.

He was an unsuccessful gold prospector, played rugby union for England, and fought in the First World War.  Biography  Giblin was the son of William Giblin, former Premier of Tasmania and member of Tasmania's influential Giblin family. He was educated at The Hutchins School, in Hobart, before going to England to study at University College, London and King's College, Cambridge, graduating with Honours in mathematics in 1896. It was there that he played international rugby for England. He travelled the world and unsuccessfully tried gold mining in northern British Columbia. He returned to Tasmania in 1906, taking up fruit growing and farming. Between 1913 and 1915 was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly. He joined the Australian Imperial Force in 1916 and served in France in the First World War, finishing with the rank of Major having been awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Military Cross. In 1918 Giblin married Eilean Mary Burton. Between 1919 and 1928 he was the Government Statistician of Tasmania. In 1929 he was made Ritchie Professor of Economics at the University of Melbourne and held that post until 1940, studying State and Federal financial relations, the concept of taxable capacity, and the measurement of tariff costs and their distribution. Giblin has been credited by some with being a precursor of Richard Kahn in the development of the concept of the multiplier.See, e.g., Donald Markwell, Keynes and Australia, Reserve Bank of Australia, 2000, pages 34-7. http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2000/pdf/rdp2000-04.pdf During the Depression of 1928-32, Giblin wrote a series of press articles entitled \\"Letters to John Smith, the causes of the crisis\\", in order to explain the situation to the general public. He was appointed as a financial advisor and given the office of acting Commonwealth Statistician between 1931 and 1932 by the Commonwealth Government led by J.A. Lyons. He was a member of the Commonwealth Grants Commission between 1922 and 1936, a director of the Commonwealth Bank between 1935 and 1942, and chairman of the Commonwealth Financial and Economic Committee from 1939 until 1946.

SIRIS  Background  The Hart Senate Office Building, first occupied in 1982 and named for Michigan Senator Philip A. Hart, broke with tradition. Unlike its predecessors, the Hart Building boasted a contemporary, energy-efficient design that could accommodate a growing number of staff members and various technological innovations. The building's centerpiece is a towering, asymmetrical -high atrium whose skylight brightens corridors and offices. While the building was under construction, a panel of curators was charged with identifying potential sculptors and establishing criteria for the commission of a contemporary work to enliven the atrium. Alexander Calder and four other artists were invited to submit proposals. Calder was approached through his dealer, Klaus Perls, on July 29, 1975, just after his 77th birthday. A sketch and a model for Mountains and Clouds were submitted by November and, in April 1976, Calder's innovative design was accepted.  Design and delays  On November 10, 1976, Calder brought the Mountains and Clouds maquette--his sheet-metal model--to Washington, D.C., to present it to the Architect of the Capitol and finalize the placement of the piece. After making minor adjustments to two of the clouds, he expressed satisfaction with the maquette as positioned in a model of the atrium. This proved to be a final visit: Calder died of a heart attack that night after he returned to New York City. Despite his death, the approval of the maquette and the siting of the work meant that fabrication of the full-sized sculpture could proceed. But in 1979, fabrication was delayed and nearly terminated when public funds for the sculpture were eliminated from the costly construction budget for the Hart Building. Financial assistance materialized in 1982 through Senator Nicholas F. Brady, who believed the Calder sculpture to be \\"the right work for the right place at the right time.\\" As New Jersey‚Äôs senator for eight months-- appointed to a vacancy pending election of a successor--Brady wished to present a gift to the Senate on his departure and offered to raise the needed funds. Together with art collector and philanthropist Paul Mellon and former Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon, Brady formed the Capitol Art Foundation, which accomplished the task. The Calder sculpture was installed in the atrium of the Hart Building in 1986.  Appearance  Because the interior of the atrium presents a complex background of doors, windows, balconies and stairwells capped by a coffered ceiling, Calder stressed simplicity in the design of the sculpture. Similarly, because of the polished white marble that dominates the space, he decided on a matte black surface for the entire piece. The mountains‚Äì- the stabile‚Äì- are made up of four flat, angular steel plates with five mountain peaks among them and two archlike legs, one branching off the other. The clouds‚Äì- the mobile‚Äì- consist of four overlapping, curvilinear aluminum plates. In the absence of any air source to propel them, they are turned by a computer-controlled motor, which generates random patterns. Shortly after their installation, the clouds ceased to move when a mechanical problem with the design of the main bearing prevented the motor-driven shaft from turning the clouds. After an exhaustive inspection of the bearing system, the office of the Senate superintendent awarded a contract in October 2001 for the redesign and manufacture of a new bearing system that will again set the clouds in motion. The placement of Mountains and Clouds makes the sculpture part of the entire irregularly shaped public space of the building, not just part of the east atrium. Calder's genius in positioning it led to the work's great success. The atrium is directly entered from the east doors to the building. As one passes through a low lobby, only a section of the black steel sheets of the mountains appears, perceived as a virtually flat surface. The whole complex composition becomes apparent only when one reaches the junction of lobby and atrium. Suddenly, the full height of the atrium and the sculpture astonishes the viewer. Had the enormous work been centered in the atrium, it might have produced an overwhelming sense of oppression or confinement. But by locating the nearest portion of the stabile some from the atrium's east wall, Calder allowed viewers the necessary space and distance to take in the whole work. The sculpture extends into the large north-south corridor (as tall as the atrium) that continues through the entire building. Most visitors probably experience the sculpture first from that corridor. They may notice it immediately on entering either the north or south doors, when one of the arch- shaped legs of the mountains appears to step out from the atrium into the corridor, or when one of the clouds enters or leaves the corridor's air space. Approaching Mountains and Clouds from the south entrance gives a different impression; one initially sees only two mountain peaks, and the highest seems to touch or merge into the lowest cloud form. From this perspective, it is the mountain-cloud unit that impresses. Perhaps the most satisfying view is from the north. The work presents an open, more fully readable composition of two or three peaks with legs and clouds that seem to float in front of the mountains. There is a large circle cut through one of the mountain sheets, offering, from this view, needed relief from the massive stabile. The arch- shaped legs are reminiscent of flying buttresses and, like flying buttresses, they provide both support and aesthetic pleasure. The walls of the atrium in which Calder's mountains stand are pierced on many levels by balconies, windows, and walkways. Thus, the mountains may be climbed, in a sense, and each stage of the ascent offers different views‚Äì-indeed, different understandings‚Äì-of the mountains and the clouds. As in actual mountain climbing, the distant clouds gradually become looming clouds during the ascent, until eventually the climber stands above them. Calder in his early years was famous for his Circus, in which his playful inventiveness found fulfillment in toy-sized sculptures. In his later years, his sculpture often seemed to aspire to the monumental condition of architecture. Throughout his life, he made sculptural equivalents of fish and whales and prehistoric animals, of birds and starry constellations. Mountains and Clouds is his grand final statement of elemental themes expressed in a powerful, space- transforming invention.

IOR is usually measured with a cue-response paradigm, in which a person presses a button when they detect a target stimulus following the presentation of a cue that indicates the location in which the target will appear. The cue can be exogenous (or peripheral), or endogenous. Inhibition of return results from oculomotor activation, regardless of whether it was produced by exogenous signals or endogenously. Although IOR occurs for both visual and auditory stimuli, IOR is greater for visual stimuli, and is studied more often than auditory stimuli.  Description  IOR was first described in depth by Michael Posner and Yoav Cohen, who discovered that, contrary to their expectations, reaction times (RT) to detect objects appearing in previously cued locations were initially faster to validly cued location (known as the validity effect), but then after a period of around 300 ms, response times to a previously cued location were longer than to uncued locations. Specifically, IOR was described as \\"an inhibitory effect produced by a peripheral (or exogenous) cue or target.\\" Example diagram of the process used in Posner'so inhibition of return experiment In the experiment that demonstrated the paradigm, participants were instructed to fixate on a center box that was flanked with a box on its right and left sides. Each trial began with the brightening of the outline of one of the peripheral boxes that was randomly selected for 150 ms. During the trial, a target (a bright filled square) occurs at the center of box at either 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, or 500 ms after the initial brightening. The target is usually in the center box(0.6), but it may also occur on either side(0.1 probability on each side). Catch trials in which no target is presented occur with probability of 0.2. Participants had to respond to the target as quickly as possible by pressing a specified key. Participants' performance in RT on the cued side increased the first 150 ms; however, they then experienced inhibition of target RT on the cued side compared to the uncued side after 300 ms. In order to explain the IOR mechanism, Anne Treisman and Gary Gelade's theory of visual search was expounded. This theory, known as the feature integration theory proposes that there are two types of visual searches: parallel searches and serial searches. According to Treisman and Gelade, attention is only required for serial searches. IOR is a mechanism that is specific for serial searches.  Types of cues  One form of cue that can be implemented in an inhibition of return task are exogenous cues. Exogenous cues are stimuli that are produced in the environment surrounding. Because one's attention is shifted to the stimulus without much thought or effort, these cues are seen as a form of reflex that the person has low control over. Due to this cue's automatic nature and lack of effort, it uses very few of our attentive resources.Jonides, J. (1981). Voluntary vs. automatic control over the mind‚Äôs eye‚Äôs movement. In J. B. Long, & A. D. Baddeley (Eds.), Attention and performance IX (pp. 187‚Äì203). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. This also causes our attention shift to be quick for exogenous cues than for endogenous cues The cue type that directly contrast exogenous cues in many way is the endogenous cue. While exogenous cues are solely what stimuli are presented in one's surrounding environment, endogenous cues are based on the internal goals, beliefs, desires, and interpretation of the person. While an outside stimulus may be present, such as a stop sign, it is the individuals interpretations and knowledge of the sign that is the endogenous cue causing them to apply pressure to their brakes. Both cues play an equally important role of directing attention in Inhibition of Return, however the way in which they do so differs on a neurological level as well. Exogenous cues are automatic and are therefore considered to fall under the \\"bottom-up\\" approach regarding attention, while endogenous cues are under the person's control and are seen as \\"top-down\\". A 2007 experiment examined the way in which bottom-up and top-down processes affect attention during IOR. Electrodes were placed in both the parietal and frontal cortices as monkeys took part in a visual search task. In the task, the salience of the target object was manipulated. In the \\"pop out\\" condition, the target stimulus was different from the distractors in both color and shape, whereas in the \\"search\\" condition many of the distractors were the same as the target either in color or shape. Researchers found that top-down signals, coming from endogenous cues, are processed predominately in the frontal cortex and offer longer lasting effects, while exogenous bottom-up cues have faster occurring effects that appear in the lateral intraparietal area.  Causes  Posner and Cohen proposed three explanations for inhibition: #inhibition results from having two alternative positions, #inhibition could result from moving attention away from a cued stimulus back to the fixation point, and #inhibition may occur because the efficiency in some part of the pathway from the cued location is reduced by the cuing. An alternative explanation of IOR is that IOR occurs after attention has been disengaged from the cued stimulus, resulting in a delayed response back to that cued stimulus. This occurs because it inhibits an individual from reorienting back to a stimulus they previously attended to. An early report suggested that IOR involves the midbrain superior colliculus. Support for this suggestion comes from work with a patient who suffered injury to one of the superior colliculi and experiments with the archer fish. Moreover, IOR is commonly triggered by an exogenous sensory signal presented in the visual periphery when the eyes are fixed. However, it has been suggested that activation of the midbrain oculomotor pathways might trigger IOR even under endogenous cueing. This conclusion has been questioned by researchers who have found in their studies that endogenous saccade activation is not efficient to produce IOR. Others believe that IOR is caused by both a delay in activation of attentional and motor processes.  Functional significance  It has been suggested that IOR promotes exploration of new, previously unattended objects during visual search or foraging by preventing attention from returning to already-attended objects, providing an evolutionary advantage. Klein hypothesized that in a parallel visual search, the difference between RTs at probe targets and empty locations should be less than in a serial visual search. He suggested that this occurs because in serial searches, \\"inhibitory tags\\" are left at each location that has been attended to. Thus, IOR is a mechanism that allows a person not to re-search in previously searched visual fields as a function of \\"inhibitory tags\\". This is known as the foraging facilitator proposal. Researchers (including Klein himself) initially challenged the foraging facilitator proposal. Pratt and Abrams suggested that IOR was not a foraging assistant because inhibition only occurred at the most recently attended stimulus. Earlier, Klein and Taylor found that it could not be concluded that attention was inhibited in IOR because at that time, inhibition had not been examined utilizing non-spatial discrimination tasks. Additionally, questions arose after it had been difficult to replicate Klein's findings, however, similar finding were reported eventually. Although researchers had proposed these challenges initially, more recent empirical studies have not only replicated Klein's findings, but have also rebutted the challenges posed initially.

He is played by Academy Award-nominee Richard Castellano in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 film adaptation of the novel, and by Bruno Kirby (as a young man) in The Godfather Part II (1974). The Godfather Born near Trapani, Sicily, Peter Clemenza is one of Don Vito Corleone's caporegimes and oldest friends, as well as the godfather of his eldest son, Sonny. He has a reputation as a superb judge of talent; his regime produced no fewer than five future capos‚ÄîSonny, Frank Pentangeli, Rocco Lampone, Al Neri, and Joey Zasa. The novel explains that when Sonny sees his father kill blackhander Don Fanucci, he tells his father that he wants to join the ‚Äúfamily business‚Äù; Vito then sends him to Clemenza for training. He is a supporting character in the story, but several of his actions are key to the plot. For example, he is ordered by Don Corleone, via consigliere Tom Hagen, to oversee the punishment of two teenage boys who received suspended sentences for beating and sexually assaulting the daughter of undertaker Amerigo Bonasera. Vito's wife, Carmela, is the girl's godmother. Clemenza assigns the job to his \\"button man\\" Paulie Gatto, who recruits two former professional boxers turned Corleone Family loan enforcers to assist. When Gatto helps drug kingpin Virgil Sollozzo set up Vito to be assassinated, Sonny - now Vito‚Äôs heir apparent - orders Clemenza to execute him. Clemenza considers Gatto's actions a personal insult, having recruited and trained him. Clemenza chooses Rocco Lampone, then an associate, to kill Gatto so Lampone can \\"make his bones\\". Clemenza has Gatto drive him and Lampone around for several hours on the pretext of locating housing (\\"mattresses\\") for Corleone soldiers in the event war breaks out with the other crime families. After Lampone shoots Gatto, Clemenza‚Äîupon returning to the car after relieving himself‚Äîutters (to Lampone) his most famous line in the film: \\"Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.\\" When it is decided that Vito's youngest son, Michael, will murder Sollozzo and Captain Mark McCluskey, a corrupt NYPD official on Sollozzo's payroll, Clemenza instructs Michael on using a gun, how to allay Sollozzo's suspicions, and what to do after the shooting. Michael retrieves a handgun that Clemenza had planted beforehand in the bathroom, and kills Sollozzo and McCluskey. Michael hides in Sicily, Clemenza prepares for an all- out war against the other four families. The war ultimately claims Sonny's life. Upon returning to New York, Vito dies a natural death, and Michael succeeds his father as Don. Clemenza, on Michael's orders, personally murders both Don Victor Stracci and Carlo Rizzi, Michael's brother-in-law, who conspired with Barzini to murder Sonny. Clemenza is last seen greeting Michael as \\"Don Corleone\\" and kissing Michael's hand. The Godfather Part II Clemenza does not appear in the present timeline of the film due to a disagreement between Castellano and Paramount Pictures over the character's dialogue and the amount of weight Castellano was expected to gain for the part. After Castellano bowed out of the film, Clemenza was written out of the script and replaced by Frank Pentangeli. It is explained that, by the time of film, Clemenza has died under suspicious circumstances; when Vito‚Äôs middle son Fredo mentions that Clemenza died of a heart attack, Corleone assassin Willi Cicci scoffs, \\"That was no heart attack,\\" implying that Clemenza may have been murdered. Clemenza, however, appears in several flashbacks to Vito Corleone's early days, played by Bruno Kirby. He first meets Vito when asking him to hide some guns for him from the police. Vito does so, and Clemenza repays the favor by stealing an expensive carpet (assisted by a surprised Vito) and giving it to the Corleones for their apartment. Around the same time, Vito and Clemenza befriend a young Tessio. One of their lines of business is selling stolen dresses door-to-door; a deleted scene depicts Clemenza charming his way into the apartment of a young housewife and emerging a little later, having presumably had sex with her. Later on, the trio's partnership is discovered by the local blackhander, Don Fanucci, who attempts to extort them. Clemenza initially suggests that they pay Fanucci to avoid any problems with him, but Vito talks him and Tessio into paying him less money. Shortly thereafter, Vito kills Fanucci and takes over the neighborhood - the beginnings of the future Corleone family. Clemenza is last seen at Vito's side as they open Genco Pura Olive Oil, the front for their criminal empire. The Sicilian Clemenza appears briefly in Puzo's second Godfather installment, The Sicilian. He meets with Michael during his exile in Sicily, at his brother Domenico Clemenza's home in Trapani. They discuss what the fate of Turi Giuliano is to be, following the orders of a recovering Vito Corleone. Clemenza tells Michael that he should report to him after a week, with or without Giuliano, and that Michael could return to America afterward. Clemenza then leaves on a boat to Tunis, telling Michael that he would be back the following day to bring him back to date with the Don's orders. The Godfather Returns Clemenza's gradual takeover of the Corleone empire in New York is briefly covered in The Godfather Returns, Mark Winegardner's sequel to Puzo's original novel. It also tells of Clemenza's involvement during Michael's return from exile and eventual, official initiation into the Corleone crime family. Most noteworthy, the novel depicts Clemenza's fatal heart attack (mentioned in The Godfather Part II), and the many conspiracy theories that he had actually been murdered by the Rosato Brothers, enemies of the Corleone Family. Video game version The video game title The Godfather: The Game depicts Clemenza as his movie counterpart; Castellano's estate gave permission for his likeness to be used in the game. However, due to Castellano's death in 1988, all of Clemenza's dialogue had to be recorded by Jason Schombing. In the game, he becomes partners and good friends with the protagonist, Aldo Trapani. He gives him several missions, such as killing members of rival families, particularly the Cuneo Family.

Gonzaullas was born in C√°diz, Spain. His parents were naturalized American citizens, visiting Spain at the time of his birth. In 1911, Gonzaullas was appointed a major in the Mexican Army, and in 1915 he became a special agent in the United States Treasury Department. In 1920, he enlisted in the Texas Rangers. For the next thirteen years, he served on the force and was actively involved in fighting the illegal activities that were common at the time, including gambling, liquor smuggling and production, prostitution, among others. When in January 1933, Miriam Amanda \\"Ma\\" Ferguson took office after being elected governor, she proceeded to discharge all serving Rangers, including Gonzaullas. In 1935, the Texas Legislature reformed the public security system and created the Texas Department of Public Safety, consisting of three divisions: the Texas Highway Patrol, the Texas Rangers and the Bureau of Intelligence. Gonzaullas was appointed superintendent of the Bureau, and he played a major role in turning it into one of the best crime laboratories in the United States. In 1940, Gonzaullas left his position at the Bureau upon his appointment as captain of Company B of the Texas Rangers, thus becoming the first American of Spanish descent to achieve the rank of captain in the force. His work was commended by his superiors and was instrumental in re-establishing the status of the agency after the instability it had gone through in the previous decades. One of his most notable assignments was to Texarkana in 1946, in order to investigate the murders committed by The Phantom Killer, a serial killer. After his retirement in 1951, Gonzaullas moved to Hollywood and became a technical consultant for radio, television, and motion pictures, in particular the long-running 1950s radio show Tales of the Texas Rangers. He died of cancer at the age of 85 while living in Dallas, Texas, on February 13, 1977, and was buried in Sparkman/Hillcrest Memorial Park in the same city.

He attended South Hills Catholic High School (since absorbed into Seton-La Salle Catholic High School) in Mt. Lebanon. He then attended Carnegie Mellon University, where he double-majored in music and English. At this time, he was teaching approximately 150 students a week and playing in nightclubs. =Segovia= Esteban states that at this point in his studies of the guitar, he felt a strong desire to study with Andr√©s Segovia. According to Esteban, after a long period where he pursued Segovia by sending notes to the hotels where he was staying, finally meeting Segovia in Los Angeles in 1972 and studied with him intermittently for the next five years, splitting his time between Spain and California. The extent of the connection between Segovia and Esteban, however, is heavily disputed. Although Esteban did meet Segovia, Esteban is not mentioned in any biography of Segovia, and Esteban never received the public acknowledgment Segovia gave students such as John Williams and Eliot Fisk. Segovia autographed one of his books for Esteban in 1978 with a flattering message, but Segovia is known to have signed hundreds or thousands of such messages. =Musical transformation= Esteban moved from Southern California to Phoenix with his wife and daughter, Teresa Paul in 1978. During the next two years, he toured playing classical music. In 1980, while driving his mother home from the airport, Esteban was involved in a collision with a drunk driver. He was left with broken ribs, missing teeth, and a light-sensitive eye. He recovered but was left with nerve damage in his hands. Unable to play the guitar, he sold solar energy systems for Reynolds Aluminum. During his long recovery, he decided to move away from playing only classical music. After recovering some of the use of his fingers in 1988, he had begun playing again by the end of 1989. =Commercial success= Esteban had been playing at a Hyatt Regency hotel when he released his first album in 1991.[ Esteban--Discography--Main Albums], Allmusic.

Described by poetshttp://wordsarewild.com/index.php/2016/10/first-sight-love/ and critics since the emergence of ancient Greece, falling in love at first sight has become one of the most common tropes in Western fiction. Historical conceptionsGreek= In the classical world, the phenomenon of \\"love at first sight\\" was understood within the context of a more general conception of passionate love, a kind of madness or, as the Greeks put it, theia mania (\\"madness from the gods\\"). This love passion was described through an elaborate metaphoric and mythological psychological schema involving \\"love's arrows\\" or \\"love darts,\\" the source of which was often given as the mythological Eros or Cupid,See, for example, the Amores and the Heroides of Ovid which frequently refer to the overwhelming passion caused by the Cupid's darts. sometimes by other mythological deities (such as RumorSee Ovid's letter from Paris, below.). At times, the source of the arrows was said to be the image of the beautiful love object itself. If these arrows arrived at the lover's eyes, they would then travel to and 'pierce' his or her heart, overwhelming them with desire and longing (love sickness). The image of the \\"arrow's wound\\" was sometimes used to create oxymorons and rhetorical antithesis. \\"Love at first sight\\" was explained as a sudden and immediate beguiling of the lover through the action of these processes, and is illustrated in numerous Greek and Roman works. In Ovid's 8 AD epic, Metamorphoses, Narcissus becomes immediately spellbound and charmed by his own (unbeknownst to him) image, and Echo also falls in love with Narcissus at first sight. In Achilles Tatius's Leucippe and Clitophon, the lover Clitophon thus describes his own experience of the phenomenon: \\"As soon as I had seen her, I was lost. For Beauty's wound is sharper than any weapon's, and it runs through the eyes down to the soul. It is through the eye that love's wound passes, and I now became a prey to a host of emotions...\\"John J. Winkler (trans.), Leucippe and Clitophon, in Another classical interpretation of the phenomenon of \\"hunger at first sight\\" is found in Plato's Symposium (c. 385-370 BC), in Aristophanes' description of the separation of primitive double-creatures into modern men and women and their subsequent search for their missing half: \\"... when [a lover] ... is fortunate enough to meet his other half, they are both so intoxicated with affection, with friendship, and with love, that they cannot bear to let each other out of sight for a single instant.\\" =Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque= The classical conception of love's arrows were elaborated upon by the Proven√ßal troubadour poets of southern France in the eleventh and twelfth centuries and became part of the European courtly love tradition. In particular, a glimpse of the woman's eyes was said to be the source of the love dart: In some medieval texts, the gaze of a beautiful woman is compared to the sight of a basilisk. Giovanni Boccaccio provides one of the most memorable examples in his Il Filostrato, where he mixes the tradition of love at first sight, the eye's darts, and the metaphor of Cupid's arrow:According to Nathaniel Edward Griffin: \\"In the description of the enamorment of Troilus is a singular blending of the Proven√ßal conception of the eyes as the birthplace of love with the classical idea of the God of Love with his bows and quiver...,\\" in \\"Nor did he (Troilus) who was so wise shortly before... perceive that Love with his darts dwelt within the rays of those lovely eyes... nor notice the arrow that sped to his heart.\\"Boccaccio, Il Filostrato, Canto 1, strophe 29 (translation by Nathaniel Edward Griffin and Arthur Beckwith Myrick). William Shakespeare pays a handsome (posthumous) tribute to Christopher Marlowe, who himself wrote \\"Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?\\" in his 1598 poem Hero and Leander, by citing him the next year in As You Like It: 'Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might: \\"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?\\"'.Peter Alexander ed., William Shakespeare: The Complete Works (London 1962) p. 273 These images of the lover's eyes, the arrows, and the ravages of \\"love at first sight\\" continued to be circulated and elaborated upon in the Renaissance and Baroque literature, and play an important role in Western fiction and especially the novel, according to Jean Rousset. Psychological conceptions Research has shown two bases for love at first sight. The first is that the attractiveness of a person can be very quickly determined, with the average time in one study being 0.13 seconds. The second is that the first few minutes, but not the first moment, of a relationship have been shown to be predictive of the relationship's future success, more so than what two people have in common or whether they like each other (\\"like attracts like\\"). Infatuation, not to be confused with love at first sight, is the state of being carried away by an unreasoned passion or assumed love. Hillman and Phillips describe it as a desire to express the libidinal attraction of addictive love,Hillman and Phillips inspired with an intense but short-lived passion or admiration for someone. Occurrence in literature and the arts King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid, 1884, by Edward Burne-Jones, depicts an older tale of love at first sight. =Biblical references= *Commentaries on the Bible often view the account of Isaac's first view of Rebekah (Genesis 24:67) as love at first sight. *The same holds for Jacob's first sight of Rachel.Nelson's New Illustrated Bible Commentary ed.

Once a chemical engineer who longed to get rich, Mark Raxton was caught in an accident that saw his body get covered by an experimental organic-liquid metal alloy, which granted him super-powers, including the ability to generate extreme heat and radiation. Turning to a life of crime, he started off as an enemy of the superhero Spider-Man, but eventually got redeemed. He is also the stepbrother of Liz Allan. The character has made appearances in several forms of media, including animated series and video games. A creature based on \\"Molten Man\\" appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), which was actually an illusion created by a series of drones operated by Mysterio. Publication history The character was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #28 (September 1965). Fictional character biography Mark Raxton was born in New York City. He was a scientist who could not wait to use his skills to become rich, and once worked at Oscorp Industries, as the laboratory assistant to Dr. Spencer Smythe, creator of the Spider-Slayers. Raxton and Smythe developed an experimental new liquid metallic alloy for the Spider-Slayers from a radioactive meteor, but Raxton attempted to steal it and sell it. In the ensuing fight with Smythe in the laboratory, Raxton spilled the liquid alloy all over himself, his skin absorbing it and turning golden. Fearing for his life, Raxton ran for the nearest hospital, only to discover that the alloy had changed him for the better when he angrily punched an irate motorist's hood, buckling it. Realizing the great potential his new abilities afforded him, Raxton, calling himself Molten Man, turned to crime to further his monetary gains. Peter Parker, as Spider-Man, nearly missed his high school graduation to stop the Molten Man's first crime spree.The Amazing Spider-Man #28. Marvel Comics (New York). Raxton was later released from jail, only to continue his criminal activities. However, he was once again defeated by Spider-Man.The Amazing Spider-Man #35. Marvel Comics (New York). Eventually, Molten Man's body begins to give off intense heat and to consume itself. His metal skin became molten, and he steals meteor fragments from a museum to attempt a cure. An encounter with Spider-Man resulted in his submergence in the polluted East River, which temporarily reversed the deterioration.The Amazing Spider-Man #132‚Äì133. Marvel Comics (New York). After a few more encounters with Spider-Man, it was revealed that Peter's friend Liz Allan was Raxton's stepsister. Raxton broke into a pharmaceutical company to steal chemicals which would reverse his condition permanently. When the procedure failed, he went berserk and kidnapped Liz. Liz was saved by Spider-Man, and Molten Man became buried beneath the laboratory.The Amazing Spider-Man #172‚Äì173. Marvel Comics (New York). He later resurfaced at the same site and once again sought his stepsister. Spider-Man prevented the Molten Man from hurting her, knocking him into a swimming pool which extinguished Molten Man's flames and cooled his molten properties. He was then taken to the Vault, a prison for superhuman criminals.The Spectacular Spider-Man #63. Marvel Comics (New York). Raxton realized that his stepsister was the only member of his family who had not abandoned him. He was eventually released from the Vault and approached Liz to apologize. Spider-Man misunderstood his intentions and battled him once more. Reconciled with Raxton, Liz and her husband Harry Osborn gave Raxton a job as head of security at Osborn Industries.Web of Spider-Man #62. Marvel Comics (New York). Molten Man later teamed up with Spider-Man and the second Green Goblin against Tombstone and Hammerhead.Web of Spider-Man #66. Marvel Comics (New York). Molten Man was then kidnapped along with Liz, Normie Osborn, and Spider-Man by Harry Osborn, who had suffered a mental lapse, making him the evil Green Goblin once again. Molten Man was saved by Spider-Man.The Spectacular Spider-Man #189. Marvel Comics (New York). Molten Man and Spider- Man have since become friends, and Molten Man has occasionally used his powers to aid Spider-Man against other supervillains. A few times he has been a bodyguard for Peter Parker's friends and family when disasters overwhelm the city. In the months following the Clone Saga, Raxton was abducted by Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin, and brainwashed. Under mind control, Molten Man attacked and killed Osborn's henchman Alison Mongraine, the only person who knew of the location of Peter and Mary Jane's baby.The Amazing Spider-Man #440‚Äì441. Marvel Comics (New York). Although Molten Man has since recovered from the mind control, he still bears a heavy burden of guilt over the incident. Sometime after Harry Osborn's death, Raxton is summoned when mysterious forces kidnap Liz Allan's son, Normie Osborn. Molten Man uses his brawn and brains to help Spider-Man and the Daily Bugle reporter Ben Urich uncover what happened. Raxton is later pressed into a supervillain group again when the Chameleon approaches him and threatens to kill Normie if Raxton does not join his 'Exterminators'.Exterminators at Marvel Universe Appendix Raxton is consequently forced to attack Liz Allan. During the Civil War storyline, Molten Man and Scarecrow were used as bait for Captain America's Secret Avengers only for the Punisher to arrive. Raxton is left in critical condition after being attacked by Punisher. Raxton next appears, still in poor condition, under the care of Liz Allan. When Harry Osborn comes to visit Liz and Normie, he and Liz argue. Hearing Liz speak Harry's name, Raxton awakens and attacks him, screaming that Harry has hurt his family for the last time, and will \\"die for real\\".The Amazing Spider-Man #581. Marvel Comics (New York). Spider-Man intervenes, but he has trouble fighting Raxton, whose powers have grown out of control. Spider-Man manages to trap Raxton in asphalt, and Harry provides him with a cure that Oscorp had been working on upon using volunteer Charlie Weiderman, the other \\"Molten Man\\". The cure is successful, returning Raxton to his original human state. Although he finally was rid of the alloy, he still retained his powers, such as super strength, energy manipulation and a new power to incinerate anything by producing fire from his palms. Harry built him a special suit, using a part of the alloy and his DNA, to help him control his powers.The Amazing Spider-Man #582. Marvel Comics (New York). When Liz Allan became the head of Alchemax, she used the company's cutting-edge technology to cure Raxton of his condition. Even though he was constantly monitored, he was no longer a threat to society and started working as a member of Alchemax's security force. As Alchemax and Parker Industries competed for a contract to build a new prison, Raxton and Tiberius Stone used Raxton's connections to hire Ghost to sabotage Parker Industries.The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 3 #16. Marvel Comics (New York). Powers and abilities Molten Man was given superhuman powers after exposure to an organic liquid metal alloy obtained from a meteor discovered by Spencer Smythe. His skin completely absorbed the experimental alloy, turning all of the external tissues of his body into a solid metallic substance, as well as the trunks, belt, and boots he was wearing at the time of the accident. As a result, Molten Man possesses superhuman strength and his skin is composed of a frictionless metal that grants him a high degree of resistance to physical injury. Raxton's metallic fingers are sensitive enough to pick locks (making him an expert safe cracker), and his skin is so slick he cannot be restrained with Spider-Man's webbing. Molten Man's skin can also generate intense heat, burning anybody who tries to touch him and shooting flaming projectiles at his foes. At one time, his skin was like molten lava, allowing him to project radiation and heat up to . In his molten form, the Molten Man's skin may reach a critical stage at which point his skin could actually melt off him. Additionally, unlike most of Spider-Man's more thuggish villains, Molten Man had brains to complement his raw physical strength. An intelligent and completely sane scientist, Molten Man was smart enough to learn from his mistakes and not fall for the same trick twice. He is a college graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering. Other versionsUltimate Marvel= In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Mark Raxton is a guitarist in a local punk rock band, the name of which is later revealed to be \\"Molten Man\\". One of their songs includes the lyrics \\"I am your molten man, and I'm melting on you\\".Ultimate Spider-Man #78. Marvel Comics (New York). He first appears in the story \\"Dumped\\", in Ultimate Spider-Man #78. He asks Mary Jane Watson on a date. She reluctantly accepts, but spends most of the evening talking about Peter Parker, who has just broken up with her. Raxton remains a gentleman the entire time. Later, he encounters Mary Jane at the mall, and upon learning that the boy she was with was Peter, tells her \\"Good for you\\", and leaves without further incident. He later appears in Ultimate Spider-Man #88, the third part of the \\"Silver Sable\\" storyline. In the story, a student from Parker's high school dresses up as Spider-Man and runs out in front of the press. He is revealed to be Mark Raxton, who tries to promote his band Molten Man before being dragged away by police.Ultimate Spider-Man #88. Marvel Comics (New York). In other mediaTelevision= The Spectacular Spider- Man * Molten Man appears in the second season of The Spectacular Spider-Man, voiced by Eric Lopez. In a departure from the comics, Mark Raxton is renamed Mark Allan, and is depicted as Liz Allan's biological brother rather than her stepbrother. He first appears being released from juvenile detention after spending six months there for stealing a car to pay off old gambling debts. He returns to Midtown High and quickly becomes smitten with Mary Jane Watson, whom he ends up dating. However, Mark eventually succumbs to his gambling addiction, and in the episode \\"Subtext\\", he becomes indebted to Blackie Gaxton. With no other way to pay off his debts, Mark becomes a test subject for the Green Goblin's experiments and is injected with a special solution by Miles Warren that causes Mark's skin to glow and grants him superhuman abilities. Secretly controlling Mark's abilities, the Goblin manipulates Mark into fighting Spider-Man as Molten Man, though he is ultimately defeated by the web-slinger and taken into police custody. Mark returns in the episode \\"Opening Night\\", having been remanded to the Vault until he is released by the Green Goblin to hunt down Spider-Man, who was there to test the prison's security. He and the inmates nearly succeeded until they are eventually knocked out by gas released by Walter Hardy and subsequently re-incarcerated. * Molten Man appears in Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors, voiced by James Arnold Taylor.

Director Jon Watts described his take for creation: \\"There‚Äôs so many Spider-Man villains from the rogues gallery that I wanted to dig a little bit deeper than what anyone might be expecting... villains like Hydro-Man and Molten Man, who may not be on the highest list. But that opened up such amazing visual possibilities and poses really dangerous challenges for Spider-Man\\". Identified as the Fire Elemental, Mysterio claimed it used its abilities to feed off of metal and energy from the Earth's core to destroy his Earth. The Fire Elemental attacked Prague during the Signal Festival, though Spider-Man and Mysterio defeated it. Not long after however, the web-slinger discovers all of the Elementals were illusions created by Mysterio and his fellow ex- Stark Industries employees to obtain Tony Stark's technology and make Mysterio look like a hero. =Video games= * Molten Man appears as a non-player character and a boss in the PS3, Xbox 360, PS4, Xbox One, and PC versions of Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2.

Bethany has a campus location set in 60 acres of Kentish countryside. Headmaster Francie Healy has been in post since September 2010. Bethany School was founded by The Reverend Joseph Kendon in 1866.  Sports and other extracurricular activities  Bethany has a wide variety of sport. Rugby, Football and Cricket are among the most popular sports for boys, with Netball, Hockey and Rounders for girls. The school also has extensive other sporting facilities, including a state of the art Fitness Suite, and 25 metre, six lane indoor swimming pool officially opened by Rebecca Adlington. A wide variety of clubs and activities are available to pupils and these are incorporated within the school day. These range from Arts & Crafts to Bee-keeping, Model Making, Equestrian, Archery, Table Tennis, Chef School and many more. The Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme is extremely popular with pupils from Year 10 upwards and each year between 15-20 pupils achieve the Gold Award. Business Studies pupils have the option in the Sixth Form of participating in Young Enterprise, a charity scheme where pupils form a business and attempt to generate profits for shareholders.  Recent development  In recent years, Bethany School has seen a major development of new buildings, including recently a six-lane 25 metre indoor swimming pool, a state of the art Fitness Suite and a dedicated Sixth Form Centre. The Orchard was completed in 1999 and provides a separate living area for Sixth Form pupils with ensuite study bedrooms. In 2001 a modern sports complex was completed, providing a new 'weights room' and also a climbing wall. A new library was completed in 2002 and the former library was converted into a drama studio. The Holmes Building which houses Business Studies and Geography was completed in 2003. In September 2005 the completely reconstructed and redesigned dining hall complex was completed. This provides for a modern approach to catering repasts for the increasing number of students, and more formal occasions. The modern Food & Nutrition rooms were opened in 2006, as well as new language classrooms. A new Astroturf was constructed in 2007. In 2009 a brand new five-million-pound Science block was built, after the previous one burnt down. 2013 saw extensive refurbishment within the boarding accommodation.  Community  Bethany has historically put a strong emphasis on community, and continues to do so; extracurricular activities are wide and numerous. = Boarding Houses = The Mount  The Mount is for boys from Years 7 to 12, who like to refer to themselves as Mounties, and has recently been refurbished with brand new, bespoke furnishings. The Mount is a boys weekly boarding and day house situated on the outskirts of the School.  Old Poplars  Currently Old Poplars is the only House that is exclusively for girls on the campus and accommodates girls from Year 7 to the Lower Sixth. Old Poplars has benefited from an extensive refurbishment programme which was completed in 2013 and it offers its girl boarders a comfortable 'home from home' character.  Pengelly  Constructed in 1975 and named after former headmaster Christian Lanzer's predecessor Kenneth Pengelly. Pengelly is a newly refurbished building, housing boys from Year 7 to the Lower Sixth.  Kendon  Kendon, named after the founder of Bethany, makes up a large proportion of the original building. It was the original Bethany House School, completed in 1866 and named after the School‚Äôs founder, J. J. Kendon; originally known as the Old School. It still retains some of its original features although it has been developed extensively over the years and, following further recent refurbishments, is one of the most modern and best-equipped Houses on site.  The Orchard  This is the newest boarding house and accommodates most of the Sixth Form pupils. All Upper Sixth and most Lower Sixth pupils have single en-suite rooms. Day pupils also have study rooms here which can be used for study periods. The Orchard has generous proportions and facilities include a kitchen, snooker table room, coffee bar, sitting room and lounge. In 2010 a new block was built adjacent to The Orchard due to increased demand for Sixth Form boarding places.  The Bethanians' Society  The Bethanians' Society was founded in 1887 for the former pupils of the School, many of whom reside in countries all over the world.

Dedicated to Tommy Bolin, it records the last Japanese concert of the Mark IV-lineup that included Bolin. It was recorded on 15 December 1975 at the Tokyo Budokan and achieved gold certification in Japan.Warner Pioneer Japan - Deep Purple - Last Concert in Japan, Certified Gold http://images.goldbergauctions.com/php/lot_auc.php?site=1&sale;=43&lot;=733‚ü®=1 The performance drew 14,000 people, an attendance record for the Budokan Hall. Parts of the concert were also recorded on 16mm film and included in the video Rises Over Japan, released in Japan in 1985. The recording was substantially edited to fit a single LP. The complete concert was remastered and restored for This Time Around: Live in Tokyo, released in 2001. In addition to including a large portion of the set omitted from the original release, the 2001 re-release restored the show's original sound quality, which was compromised when a hurriedly mastered audio track meant for a potential video release was used to hasten the original release. The album's original cover incorrectly stated that it included a live version of \\"Woman from Tokyo\\", when it included only a short jam on its main riff, performed during Jon Lord's organ solo. This displeased Deep Purple fans, who assumed the misinformation was intended to boost sales. In a 1995 interview, Glenn Hughes called Last Concert in Japan an \\"awful record\\". He said it \\"should never have been released\\" because \\"Tommy couldn't play\\", as Bolin had taken drugs the night before and fallen asleep on his left arm for eight hours.Deep Purple - Rock Family Trees - 1995 Track listingPersonnel ;Deep Purple *Jon Lord ‚Äì keyboards, Hammond organ, backing vocals *Ian Paice ‚Äì drums, percussion *David Coverdale ‚Äì lead vocals *Glenn Hughes ‚Äì bass, vocals *Tommy Bolin ‚Äì guitar, lead vocals on \\"Wild Dogs\\" ;Additional Personnel *Produced by Deep Purple and Martin Birch *Engineered by Martin Birch *Assistant engineer: Shigeo Matsumoto CertificationsReferences Category:Albums produced by Martin Birch Category:1977 live albums Category:Deep Purple live albums Category:Purple Records live albums Category:Warner Records live albums ","title":"Last Concert in Japan"},{"id":"2741056","text":"Bob Fass (born June 29, 1933) is an American radio personality and pioneer of free-form radio, who has broadcast in the New York region for over 50 years. Fass's program, Radio Unnameable, has aired in some form from 1963 to the present primarily on WBAI, a radio station operating out of New York City. Early years Bob Fass was born June 29, 1933 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1955. When he went into the army in 1956, he started a theater at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Fass received a scholarship to study acting with Sandy Meisner and Sydney Pollack at the Neighborhood Playhouse and was also a member of Stella Adler's workshop. He appeared on stage in Brendan Behan's The Hostage at Circle in the Square, The Execution of Private Slovik with Dustin Hoffman, and The Man with the Golden Arm at the Cherry Lane, among other New York productions. In 1960, he took over the role of the warden in the legendary off-Broadway production of Threepenny Opera with Lotte Lenya. Over the next two years, he played a variety of roles in the show, also acting as assistant stage manager. In 1963, he began working at WBAI, operated by the Pacifica Foundation. Novelist and poet Richard Elman, a friend of Fass's from high school, who was producing programs for the station's Drama & Literature Department, helped Fass get a job as an announcer. He then was given the midnight to dawn time block to use as he wished. Radio Unnameable The Unnamable by Samuel Beckett, which Fass was reading at the time, gave the show its title. His signature greeting, \\"Good morning, cabal,\\" came from a listener. \\"I wanted a sign-on line, like William B. Williams \\"Good morning, world,\\" says Fass. > Someone sent in a postcard suggesting, \\"Good morning, cabal.\\" I looked it up > in the dictionary and discovered that the word, cabal, comes from \\"horse.\\" > Originally, people met on horseback at night with their identities > concealed-even from each other‚Äîto plot or plan something subversive. And I > thought, that's it: \\"Good morning, cabal.\\"Pacifica's WBAI by Jeff Land =Show content= The show was described as a free-form show often with random phone calls and political discussion.\\"Fisher, Marc, (2006) \\"Voice of the Cabal\\", The New Yorker, December 4, 2006 Nowhere else, Jay Sand writes, could you hear a DJ > playing two records at the same time or backwards, or the same song over and > over and over again, simply because he liked its message.

Fass collaborated with Gerd Stern and Michael Callahan's media collective, USCO,Gerd Stern, \\"From Beat Scene Poet to Psychedelic Multimedia Artist in San Francisco and Beyond, 1948-1978,\\" an oral history conducted in 1996 by Victoria Morris Byerly, Regional Oral History Office, The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, 2001. Retrieved on August 15, 2008. which had produced sound fields for Timothy Leary's Fillmore East shows, then dove in and began creating mixes on the air. In the mid 1970s, Fass asked the station's Chief Engineer, Mike Edl, if there was any way to rig up a contraption that would allow Fass to put as many as ten phone calls on the air at the same time. The system Edl built became a centerpiece of Fass's show, allowing more of his listeners to connect with him, and with each other. =Response to the show= Neil Fabricant, Legislative Director of New York's ACLU during the 1960s, has said that Fass was \\"a midwife at the birth of the counterculture.\\" Ralph Engleman, in his book, Public Radio & TV in America: A Political History, cites Fass as \\"the first to develop the full potential of free-form radio and make it a major vehicle of the counterculture.\\" and Wavy Gravy refers to him as \\"the father of freeform radio.\\" He also plays a major role in Marc Fisher's book, Something In The Air, which covers radio's impact in the post-TV years. The Washington Post columnist describes how the \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more!\\" scene in the film, Network, grew out of an actual incident when WOR's Jean Shepherd exhorted his listeners to throw open their windows, stick out their heads, and shout, \\"Excelsior!\\", then he goes on to write \\"Radio Unnameable would inspire a monsoon of musical, sexual, pharmacological, political, and social change\\" > Shepherd took the unseen audience and let them see each other, but it's Bob > Fass who took that to the next level, giving it social and political > meaning. Fass really opened the door and summoned the audience into the > action. He used the mass media to amass a very real movement. \\"Midwife to a Movement\\"Human Fly-In= Some believe it began one night on-air in 1967, when Fass invited \\"the Cabal\\" to join him for the Fly-In, a get together at JFK airport where he and his friends could meet and party with Radio Unnameable listeners and their friends, while aircraft took off and landed in the background. (\\"My vision was like the Hawaiians who greet you when you get off the plane with leis, a kiss, and song,\\" Fass says.) About a month later, on February 11, 1967, 3000 people showed up at midnight \\"on the coldest day of the year\\", to play guitar and hang out at the International Arrivals Terminal. Fass told author Jay Sand, \\"that was the first inkling I had that there were so many people and that they wanted so much to get together.\\" \\"Something about this electronic thing - this radio station - makes it possible to listen to other people like themselves and they get the idea they aren't alone.\\" =Sweep In= Excited by the response to the Fly In, Fass and his friends looked for another opportunity to gather. Emmett Grogan of the Diggers suggested the next get together should put all that energy towards a good purpose, \\"like cleaning up the junk on the Lower East Side.\\" They announced plans for a Sweep In which would be held on April 8, 1967 and invited the audience to join them in cleaning up Krassner's garbage-strewn block; 7th Street between Avenue D and Avenue C. Word of the upcoming spring- cleaning eventually reached New York's Sanitation Department. Apparently embarrassed by the idea of dirty hippies doing their work for them, city trucks were dispatched in the wee hours to clean the block, from top to bottom, a hitherto unprecedented occurrence. That didn't dampen the enthusiasm of Fass's listeners. When they arrived armed with brooms, mops, sponges and cleaning solutions and discovered the original mission had been accomplished; they simply moved down to 3rd Street and started scrubbing there. The New York Times reported a sizeable group of participants were kids who came in from Westchester County and Long Island. =Yippies= It wasn't long before the movement nurtured in NYC went national. Abbie Hoffman became a household name in August 1967, after he led an anti-capitalist demonstration at the New York Stock Exchange, showering the traders with dollar bills. Radio Unnameable became the communications hub of the Yippies!, the Youth International Party, started by Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Fass, Krassner, and a few others, to bring flower children, acidheads and old lefties together into one group that could change the course of American society. The Yippies! got worldwide attention that October when they applied for permission to levitate the Pentagon during a massive anti-Vietnam War demonstration that attracted 50,000 to Washington D.C. Fass can be heard on tapes of the event (along with Ed Sanders of the rock group The Fugs, and Mountain Girl) chanting, \\"out demons, out!\\" as they attempt to exorcize the evil spirits at the War Department. =Yip In at Grand Central= Not every one appreciated the Yippies' sense of humor and it proved hard to keep things light in 1968. Fass and his friends spent months on the air plotting a march on Chicago to coincide with the Democratic National Convention. They dubbed it the \\"Festival of Life\\", in contrast to the \\"Festival of Death,\\" they felt the political power brokers were advancing in Vietnam. As a kind of a practice run for the big event, the Yippies decided to hold a Yip In at Grand Central Terminal in New York in March 1968. It began as a happy go lucky party; a reunion of people who'd met at the Fly In and the Easter Be-In in Central Park the previous year. WBAI had reporters on the scene and Fass was broadcasting calls from Paul Krassner and others at Grand Central, describing the good vibes and great turn out. Then suddenly, things turned violent. Several hippies from the commune, Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers, decided it would be a symbolic gesture to rip the hands off the clock at the train station in \\"a rape of time.\\" A couple others set off firecrackers and the NYPD began cracking heads and smashing cameras. As the panicked crowd streamed for the exits, over 200 cops cornered them, throwing individuals like Village Voice reporter, Don McNeil, through glass doors, and dragging others out and arresting them. Radio Unnameable provided a link between people inside the terminal and the audience listening at home. He broadcast eyewitness accounts from the scene and spoke to Abbie Hoffman, who was getting his wounds patched up at Bellevue Hospital. Washington Post reporter, Nicholas Von Hoffman, came directly from Grand Central to join Fass on the air. It was a brutal initiation for the Yippies but it was also the moment that solidified Fass's place in the city. He was providing up to the second, unfiltered news that citizens wary of mainstream press coverage could trust. As Sand points out in the Radio Waves Unnameable‚Äî \\"Bob Fass did not just report the news, he helped mold the events of the time.\\" =Columbia occupation= The next month, when Columbia students occupied school buildings to protest the University's stance on the war and a plan to evict Harlem residents in order to build a gymnasium, WBAI, with Fass's show in the lead, \\"acted as a nerve center for the demonstrators.\\" After the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, Fass provided in depth, ongoing alternative coverage, giving listeners and independent investigators a chance to grieve, discuss theories, express opinions and trade information considered too controversial for the major media. =1968 DNC= In the weeks leading up to the 1968 Democratic National Convention, callers and guests on Radio Unnameable debated the wisdom of marching directly into the path of Mayor Richard J. Daley's troops. Fass cautioned listeners \\"to know what they were getting into should they choose to go. They don't mess around in Chicago.\\" Vin Scelsa, later a major NYC radio broadcaster in his own right, then a WBAI listener, told Jay Sand, \\"We all should have been indicted as co-conspirators, not just the Chicago Seven. We were all in on it. That whole thing was planned on Bob's show.\\" Fass rarely left his command center in WBAI's Master Control but at the very last minute, he flew to Chicago and recorded everything he saw and heard. After reporting a noise that sounded like \\"an M1 cracking against someone's head,\\" Fass noticed that some of the national guardsmen \\"look very frightened. They are putting on their gas masks. They aren't very experienced with them.\\" The ensuing attack, roughing up hippies and network news reporters, was broadcast live on television. When the dust settled, several of Fass's comrades were arrested for conspiracy and inciting to riot. Fass escaped indictment and returned to WBAI, where over the next decade, his show became a kind of an alternative Town Hall; Abbie Hoffman called virtually every night with an update from the show trial of the Chicago Seven, which lasted for months. =Rubin Carter= Over the long years of Rubin Carter's incarceration for a murder he did not commit, attorney Flo Kennedy called Radio Unnameable regularly \\"to keep the case in the consciousness of at least listeners to late night radio,\\" says Fass. He remembers visiting Woodstock during the early 1970s and telling Bob Dylan \\"Carter was being railroaded for being \\"an uppity nigger.\\" Several years later, Dylan produced his epic song telling the story of the unjust conviction (Hurricane) and formed his Rolling Thunder Review specifically to raise funds for Carter's defense. Fass calls the subsequent retrial and vindication of Carter \\"one of the great cooperative efforts where hippies and blacks united to achieve change before Jessie Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.\\" The 1970s onward Fass continued to do his show as New York City and WBAI went through radical changes. In the 1970s, the Movement split into factions and new program directors and station managers began to alter the thrust of the programming, apportioning blocks of airtime to feminists, gay rights activists, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Native Americans, and other interest groups. Fass and many others felt this approach was the very antithesis of the personal character of WBAI. =Station takeover and lock-out= In 1977, Fass found himself at the forefront of a power struggle for the future of the station. He participated in a staff attempt to form a union. Management accused him of \\"living in the past\\" and ordered him not to discuss the station's internal business on the air. That was a request he found impossible to adhere to because he felt strongly that listeners paying to support non-commercial radio deserved to know and have a voice in what was being planned. The stand off ended with some staff members seizing control of WBAI's transmitter at the Empire State Building, while others (including Fass) remained barricaded in the studios, broadcasting until the phone lines were cut and the police arrived to haul them away. New York City's free speech station padlocked the front door and suspended broadcasting for 35 days. Fass was banned for five years, during which he returned to stage acting, did a guest residency at WFMU in New Jersey, and campaigned to return to WBAI. =Reinstatement= Since his reinstatement in 1982, Fass has continued in the same vein. Singers like Jeffrey Lewis, Roy Zimmerman, Debby Dalton, Kathy Zimmer and Rav Shmuel, blues guitarists Toby Walker and Guy Davis, radical environmentalist Keith Lampke and visual artists like Keith Haring, Art Spiegelman and MacArthur Fellow Ben Katchor, are just a few who have joined the roster of Radio Unnameable guests. Fass reassembled the members of The Lovin' Spoonful on the air, emceed the Phil Ochs Memorial, and flew to Houston to celebrate Jerry Jeff Walker's birthday, which he taped and played on the radio. In the mid-1980s, Fass was nearly homeless. AJ Weberman rented a truck for Fass and a large storage unit to hold his archives, paid in advance for many years. Fass was last paid for his radio time in 1977. Musicians like Dave Bromberg turn up at tributes to thank Bob \\"for giving us our careers.\\" Many of his prot√©g√©es have turned colleagues, like Steve Post, Larry Josephson, and Vin Scelsa, and have spoken of his generosity with his time. Listeners have made donations to his retirement fund. \\"It's better than BAI paying me that people remember me, I guess,\\" Fass says.Listener donation account at AARP (Broken Link) By 2006, Fass's time on WBAI had been reduced to just one night a week. He continues to host in that single weekly overnight time slot. On October 4, 2019, WBAI canceled all of its original programming including Fass's show in a desperation maneuver to keep the station on the air. After subsequent litigation, the affected programming returned to WBAI on November 7. Notable Guests Fass remembers his very first guest on the air was Paul Krassner, editor of The Realist, soon followed by Zen poet D.A. Levy. Krassner became a regular, along with Timothy Leary, Wavy Gravy, (aka comedian Hugh Romney), filmmaker Robert Downey, David Amram, comic actor and writer, Marshall Efron, the club performer, Brother Theodore, and Kinky Friedman (years before he began writing mystery stories and took up politics). Notable guests include investigative reporter Mae Brussell, Abbie Hoffman commenting on the Chicago Seven trial, a planning session for the Central Park Be-In, and the first radio appearance of Phoebe Snow. The show has featured the work, and the first performances of Arlo Guthrie's \\"Alice's Restaurant\\" and Jerry Jeff Walker's \\"Mr. Bojangles.\\"Fisher, Marc. Something in the Air: Radio, Rock, and the Revolution That Shaped a Generation. Page 136. Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky, and Gregory Corso, turned up multiple times. Over the course of the years, activist attorney Flo Kennedy kept listeners abreast of the latest injustices in America's court system. Steve Ben Israel and Judith Malina of the Living Theater, actor Rip Torn (and more recently his son, director Tony Torn), Ed Sanders, Tuli Kupferberg, and the rest of The Fugs, all made themselves comfortable on Fass's show. Abbie Hoffman, the former civil rights organizer turned political provocateur appeared regularly during the tumultuous years from 1968-1973. =Musicians= A long list of musicians have appeared on Radio Unnameable, including Townes Van Zandt, David Peel, Richie Havens, Jose Feliciano, Joni Mitchell, The Fugs, Patti Smith and Phil Ochs (parodying \\"Positively 4th Street\\"; half pretending a comic competition with Bob Dylan, but later telling disapproving callers that it was Dylan's right to play with an electric guitar and a band behind him). The Incredible String Band came over from England with their manager, Joe Boyd, Happy and Artie Traum often stopped by before heading back to Woodstock. Other performers include Taj Mahal, Paul Siebel, Muddy Waters, Otis Spann, Skip James, Rosalie Sorrels, Tiny Tim, Jake & the Family Jewels, Cat Mother & the All Night Newsboys, Melanie, Penny Arcade, Rambling Jack Elliot, Tom Rapp and Pearls before Swine, Frank Zappa, Jeremy Steig, The Holy Modal Rounders, Sis Cunningham and Sammy Walker. =Bob Dylan= Fass met Dylan before he began his radio career, double dating with Carla Rotolo, one-time stage manager of The Hostage, and her sister, Suze, who was Dylan's girlfriend. > We went out to dinner in the Village and played poker at Dylan's apartment > over The Music Inn on W. 4th Street,\\" Fass remembers. \\"When I started the > show, he listened and occasionally I could squeeze a suggestion out of him. > He turned me on to Lightnin' Hopkins.\\" Dylan's first appearance on radio was on Radio Unnameable doing comic improvs with Suze Rotolo and John Herald in 1963. Listeners also got a preview of his forthcoming album, Freewheelin'. In 1966, in the midst of recording Blonde on Blonde, he returned to Radio Unnameable, taking calls from listeners. When Dylan's crusading anthem, Hurricane, came out in the mid 1970s, Fass played it all night for five nights in a row and in 1986, when Dylan turned 45; he organized a 45-hour marathon of his music for WBAI. Fass explained the connection to NPR reporter (and former WBAI news reporter) Jon Kalish, this way: > Bob Dylan is the leading bard of our age. I feel grateful to have been alive > while he's been writing. In a way, it's like having known Shakespeare. Style Fass has never been a brilliant monologist like Jean Shepherd who preceded him on WOR in the late 50s, nor a star interviewer. His style is to make a few gentle stabs at drawing his guest out, and then he's content to go with the flow. His singular talent, as Sand notes in The Radio Waves Unnameable, is for orchestrating the great mix; \\"For Fass, beauty exists in the way events intertwine... the art came in the complete presentation... and for better or worse, the divergent strands of life which Fass presented would have fused to form a lucid whole by the time he said, 'BYE BYE'.\\" Unlike almost any other radio or television personality, silence never scares Fass. Seconds pass as he seemingly ponders the thoughts of his guests, leaving them or the listener a space to fill in the blanks. In addition, to being a congenial master of ceremonies, Fass is a good listener. He has always been ready to lend an ear and share the air with absolutely anyone who felt they had something to say. This largesse often leads to endless, boring mouthing off, but equally often leads to dynamic, intimate flurries of insight, energy, humor and understanding. Remembering the appearance of the Brooklyn Black Panthers on Radio Unnameable back in the day, Fass says, \\"I kind of like it when people come up a little hostile and suspicious and I and the audience warm them up and win them over by the end of the show.\\" Community organizers know they can always count on Fass for airtime to spread word of current crises or upcoming events. He is an ongoing outlet for the unsung, unspun, ignored and unknown. Issues Fass was a fierce and consistent critic of, as he calls it, \\"Bush's war for oil\\", and continues to speak out against capital punishment, often putting prisoners who call from jail on the air. Anti-draft protestors would phone from the courthouse after being arrested to ask Bob's audience for help in raising bail. A woman called to say her landlord had set fire to her building, and she had no other place to go‚Äîwere there any carpenters listening who might help her rebuild? He has returned to the issue of homelessness in New York numerous times, raising awareness about the dangerous city shelters, reporting on the gentrification of many of the city's neighborhoods which traditionally had offered affordable housing, and slamming the city's \\" assault on rent control.\\" In the mid-1980s, Fass made remote recordings at the tent city the homeless had erected in Tompkins Square Park on the Lower East Side. He went on to work with the Living Theater and members of that community to produce a piece of theater based on their experiences (which included both professional actors and homeless people), called The Hands of God. At least one suicidal listener (later identified as Michael Valenti), called in to receive on air counseling: In 1971, a man called in about 2:45 AM, and announced that he had taken three kinds of sleeping pills and was going to commit suicide. He asked Fass to promise not to trace the call, but Fass refused. \\"I didn't want to lie to him,\\" Fass explained to a reporter the next day. \\"If the last thing someone says to you is a lie, that kind of cheapens life.\\" Fass spent the next two hours talking to the caller live on the air, as other WBAI workers contacted the police, and the phone company attempted to trace the call. Later that morning, the police finally found the caller lying unconscious on his bedroom floor. His telephone was off the hook, the radio tuned to WBAI. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition but survived. Fass says the man contacted him later and thanked him for being there. The press tried to turn Fass into a hero, but he demurred. When a Daily News reporter arrived at his home, wanting to take his picture, Fass passed him a photo of his colleague, Larry Josephson, through a crack in the door. Josephson made the front page, identified incorrectly as \\"Bob Fass, WBAI's heroic DJ.\\" Fass later commented that he thought, \\"Larry would enjoy having his picture in the paper.\\" Influence In his book about life at WBAI, Playing in the FM Band, Steve Post describes Fass as \\"a gigantic man with receding blond hair and thick black-rimmed glasses, with hands so huge they appeared to dominate his enormous frame. His voice, soft and gentle, which I heard coming from the office monitors seemed somehow detached from his body.\\" Post, who began as WBAI's bookkeeper before hosting a program of his own, The Outside, describes how Fass took him under \\"his ample wing\\" and allowed him to watch him at work, teaching him what he knew, demystifying the whole process. Julius Lester, a former SNCC photographer, recalls being so in awe of Fass that for the first year he did his own program at WBAI people constantly mistook him for Bob. Larry Josephson, who would become WBAI'S morning man and eventually station manager, remembers the first time Bob motioned him into Master Control: \\"It was like Dorothy entering Oz.\\" Fass has encouraged dozens of wanna-be DJs. His continuing impact is clear, according to Marc Fisher, author of Something in the Air (Random House, 2007), who says Fass has inspired countless other personalities like Sirius shock jock Howard Stern (who listened to Bob a lot as a kid), Tom Leykis in L.A., and Vin Scelsa, to ride the radio waves. \\"I like the idea of sharing, from each according to their ability, to each according to their need,\\" says Fass. \\"I want to connect people in one city with people in another. I think information can cure almost anything.\\" \\"Like many others, Bob wanted to change the world. Unlike many others, he had access to the airwaves and therefore a very real opportunity to do so,\\" says Sand. Legacy In 2005, attorney Neil Fabricant, President Emeritus of the School of Social Policy at GWU, organized a rent party for Fass. \\"The right wing has spent billions of dollars to revise the history of an era and to distort the collective memory,\\" Fabricant says. He suggests that restoring and properly archiving the 45 years of Bob Fass's program \\"would be a giant first step in reclaiming that history.\\" A documentary film about Fass and the show, also named Radio Unnameable, aired on the World Channel series America ReFramed on September 17, 2013.\\"Radio Unnameable Movie\\" - website 80 hours of Radio Unnameable have been acquired and are currently available at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York. Good Evening Cabal, a weekly show on a Florida-based community FM station, is named as a tribute to Bob Fass by its host, Curt Werner, who as a Brooklyn teenager listened to Fass in the 1960s on WBAI. The program, which features music from the 1960s and 1970s, and live interviews with artists and writers from that era, has been on the air for four years on WSLR 96.5 LPFM in Sarasota, Florida. Fass himself appeared as a guest on the show in 2007.

The capital of a state is a declarative piece of information, while knowing how to ride a bike is not. Episodic memory and semantic memory are a further division of declarative information. Overview There are two ways to learn a telephone number: memorize it using your declarative memory, or use it many times to create a habit. Habit learning is called procedural memory Declarative memory uses your medial temporal lobe and enables you to recall the telephone number at will. Procedural memory activates the telephone number only when you are at the telephone, and uses your right-hemisphere's skill, pattern recognition. Research indicates declarative and habit memory compete with each other during distraction. When in doubt, the brain chooses habit memory because it is automatic. Several researchers at the UCLA tested the hypothesis that distraction can change the way a task is learned. In their experiment, they played a series of high and low tones while asking subjects to do a simple probabilistic classification task. In the single task (ST) case, subjects only learned to predict the weather. In the dual task (DT) case, subjects were also asked to count the number of high pitched tones. The ability to use the learned knowledge was found to be about the same in either case. However, subjects were significantly better at identifying cue-associations (a test of declarative knowledge) when trained under ST rather than DT conditions. Furthermore, fMRI showed activity in the hippocampus was associated with performance under ST, but not DT conditions, whereas activity in the putamen showed the opposite correlation. The authors concluded that while distraction may not decrease the level of learning, it can result in a reduced ability to flexibly use that knowledge Empirical evidence Declarative learning is an important skill that we use to acquire new information, such as in education. Declarative learning can be seen as what we know, for example we know that Paris is the capital of France. =Children= Sleep deprivation and learning have continually been linked together. The common belief is that sleep deprivation can affect children when they are learning at school or in any daily task. However, different types of learning are processed differently and have different outcomes when a child is sleep deprived. A study conducted by Csabi, Benedk, Janacesk, Katona and NemethCs√°bi, E., Benedek, P., Janacsek, K., Katona, G., & Nemeth, D. (2013). Sleep disorder in childhood impairs declarative but not nondeclarative forms of learning. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 35(7), 677-685. looked at the impairment of declarative and nondeclarative learning when a child is sleep-deprived. Nondeclarative learning was measured by having children perform an Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task. This task had a dog's head appear in four empty circles. Every time the dog's head appeared the child had to press the corresponding letter as quickly and correctly as possible. Declarative learning was measured by \\"The War of the Ghosts\\" test, which is a recall test where the children were told a short story consisting of thirty-six sentences and had to then recall it immediately after hearing it. The study showed that nondeclarative learning was preserved and not affected when sleep-deprived children took the ASRT task. However, declarative learning greatly declined in the face of sleep-deprivation. Declarative Learning can be associated with tasks that require a greater amount of attention, such as learning in school. Therefore, the lack of sleep a child obtains can affect declarative learning and can affect how well a child learns during school overall. Research focusing on children has also looked at different ways of utilizing declarative learning when it comes to memorizing tasks. Backhaus, Hoeckesfeld, Born, Hohagen, and Junghanns Backhaus, J., Hoeckesfeld, R., Born, J., Hohagen, F., & Junghanss, K. (2007, June). Immediate as well as delayed post learning sleep but not wakefulness enhances declarative memory consolidation in children. Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. Retrieved October 19, 2014 conducted a study to see if sleeping after a task enhances declarative learning in children. Children between the ages of nine and twelve were given a word association task consisting of forty related word pairs. The lists of words were repeated continuously until the child participating could recall at least twenty words out of the forty given. The child was allowed to go to sleep for the night and was tested for recall right after they had woken up. The child was then asked to go about their day and was tested for recall later during the day. The study showed that declarative learning, memory and retention significantly increased only after an interval of sleep that immediately followed learning. This research provides evidence of sleep in the role of declarative learning, sleep consolidation, as well as stresses the importance of sleep for declarative learning during childhood. =Adults= Declarative learning is not solely affected by sleeping but can also be affected by levels of stress as well as hormones. In a study conducted by Espin et al.Espin, L., Almela, M., Hidalgo, V., Villada, C., Salvador, A., & Gomez, J. (2013, May 13). Acute pre-learning stress and declarative memory: impact of sex, cortisol response and menstrual cycle phase. Hormones and Behavior, 63(5). stress, hormones and menstrual cycle phases in women, were tested for their effect on declarative learning in young adults. Participants were asked to participate in a Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) where they were asked to give a speech to a simulated committee about why they deserved the position for their dream job. If the participant did not finish their speech in five minutes the committee would then ask standardized questions the researchers had provided. After the speech the participant was asked to complete a five-minute arithmetic task. The TSST was set up to induce stress in the participants before they proceeded to the declarative learning task. For the Declarative Learning task the participants were asked to complete a Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task (RAVLT), which has the participants look over a set of words and then asks them to recall as many as they can. The study showed that if women were not exposed to the TSST task before the RAVLT there was an increase of declarative learning and recall when compared to the men. However, when the participants were exposed to the TSST task before the RAVLT then declarative learning and recall were equal for both men and women. Women during the study that were menstruating and exposed to the TSST task showed lower levels of stress than women not menstruating, they also had an increase of declarative learning and recall when compared to men and women not menstruating . The study not only shows that sex hormones could reduce stress in women but also that stress can have a negative effect on declarative learning. This could affect the capability of students learning and passing their classes and also the ability to be able to complete tasks in the workplace. Sleep benefits declarative learning across a range of tasks for children and young adults, however little is known of the role that sleep plays for adults when it comes to declarative learning. A study conducted by Wilson, Baran, Schott, Ivry and Spencer Wilson, J., Baran, B., Schott, E., Ivry, R., & Spencer, R. (2007, June). Sleep modulates word-pair learning but not motor sequence learning in healthy older adults. Neurobiology of Aging, 33(5). sought to see if sleep plays an important role in declarative learning and motor skill learning in adults. Participants were given two tasks to assess motor skill learning and another to assess declarative learning. The participants learned a motor sequence and list of word pairs during either the morning or evening. Memory tests were given to the participants twice, at twelve and twenty-four hours after training. This gap allowed for a period of sleep, a recall test, a period of normal wake, and a recall test. The study results showed that motor skills were not dependent on sleep. However, declarative learning tasks and recall increased when the participants slept before the recall test. The study also showed that a change in sleep patterns and networks activated during sleep may contribute to age-related decline in motor sequences but does not affect declarative learning. This study shows that even though the role of sleep may change throughout age it is still very important to declarative learning regardless of age. Another aspect of research is seeing the importance of declarative learning in both implicit and explicit learning tasks. In a study conducted by Matthew Kirkhart Kirkhart, M. W. (2001). The Nature of Declarative Knowledge and Nondeclarative Knowledge for Implicit and Explicit Learning. General Psychology, 128(4), 447-461. undergraduate participants underwent implicit and explicit artificial-grammar learning tasks to see how declarative learning functioned in each. For the Implicit task participants were told that they would see a series of letter strings, a group of letters that appear in a word, and had to judge if the string were well formed or not well formed. For the Explicit task participants were told they had to reproduce letter strings according to a set of rules, which they had to determine and would be tested on later. The participants were then shown a series of letter strings and asked if they followed the rules or not. The results showed that declarative learning was not required for implicit learning but was related to the consistency in performance. It was seen, however, that declarative learning is required for explicit learning and consistency of performance. This shows that adults are using declarative learning when undergoing explicit tasks, such as memorizing formulas for a statistics class. This research provides more evidence of the importance of declarative learning in education for not just children but for adults as well.

Its first usage can be traced to the Middle Ages. It is a popular name among Jewish people. The feminine form for this name is Chaya ( ', Classical Hebrew: , Israeli Hebrew: ; English pronunciations: , ). Chai is the Hebrew word for \\"alive\\". According to Kaballah, the name Hayim helps the person to remain healthy, and people were known to add Hayim as their second name to improve their health. In the United States, Chaim is a common spelling; however, since the phonemic pattern is unusual for English words, Hayim is often used as an alternative spelling. The \\"ch\\" spelling comes from transliteration of the Hebrew letter \\"chet\\", which also starts words like Chanukah, Channa, etc., which can also be spelled as Hanukah and Hannah. It is cognate to the Arabic word ('), with the same meaning, deriving from the same Proto-Semitic root. L'Chaim in Hebrew is a toast meaning \\"to life\\". When a couple becomes engaged, they get together with friends and family to celebrate. Since they drink l'chaim (\\"to life\\"), the celebration is also called a l'chaim. Hebrew letters are also used as numerals, and the Hebrew letters that spell \\"chai\\" also stand for the number 18. Thus, 18 is considered a lucky number in Jewish culture. It is common to give gifts and contributions to charity in multiples of 18. Among Argentine Jews, the Spanish name Jaime (, a Spanish cognate of James) is often chosen for its phonetic similarity to Haim.

It won the 1982 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and was also nominated for the 1983 John W. Campbell Memorial Award. It was included in David Pringle's book Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels. Plot synopsis The novel follows the story of a modern black American man who is able to mentally project himself back to pre-human Africa, where he meets (and eventually mates) with humanity's prehistoric ancestors. At less than 1-year old, John Monegal is abandoned by his mother and adopted by USAF officer Hugo Monegal and his wife Jeanette. Since the very beginning of his life, John dreams of an ancient world and becomes an expert of the Pleistocene epoch, the era of the Homo habilis in Africa. When he is 18, John gets in touch with a paleonthologist, Alistair Patrick Blair, who serves as prime minister in the fictional country of Zarakal (approximately representing Kenya according to the author's preface) and works closely with a US physical scientist, Woodrow Kaprow, who has developed a time machine which brings John back to the era he dreams of. Just before leaving to the past, John discovers his mother wants to publish a book based on voice records of his dreams, and angry and deluded, he leaves her house and changes his name into Joshua Kampa. Almost lost in the remote past of a world which is the frontier between non-human and human life, John/Joshua feels he has reached the reality he always belonged to, and is accepted by a group of individuals who live in the African savanna. He gives a name to all his new friends, and learns to eat and live like them. Joshua starts thinking he will never get back to the 20th century. After a while he falls in love with a pre-historic woman, Helen, who gets pregnant and dies at the daughter's birth. To save his child and let her survive in a better world, Joshua goes back to the area of the time machine, where he is mysteriously saved by two African astronauts apparently coming from the future. Back to his actual life, Joshua finds he lost his dreaming power and learns that only a month in modern world's time has passed since he left; this is why he struggles in being believed about his daughter. As years pass, Joshua learns his daughter has the same dreaming power he used to have, but she is projected towards the future. After several years Joshua becomes a minister of the Zarakali government, and his 15-year-old daughter escapes with an agent from Uganda, Dick Aruj, who has convinced her to join a program of time travel to the future.

Bachman was one of the four founding members of BTO, a group that have sold nearly 30 million albums worldwide and also featured his brothers Randy (guitar/vocals) and Robbie (drums), as well as Fred Turner (bass/vocals). Career Tim Bachman had played guitar in a few Winnipeg area bands, some with his younger brother Robbie on drums. He then briefly quit music, feeling that the Winnipeg scene had become stagnant, and he got a job and began attending college. He returned to music in 1972, when older brother Randy was looking to add a second guitar to the Brave Belt lineup. This occurred after the departure of Chad Allan, which left Brave Belt with only three members. Bachman wrote or co-wrote several songs during his tenure with Brave Belt and BTO, including \\"Put It in a Song\\" (with Turner) for the Brave Belt II album, \\"Down and Out Man\\" (with R. B. Charles) for the first BTO album, and \\"Blown\\" (with Randy) and \\"I Don't Have To Hide\\" for Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive II. Bachman left BTO in 1974, shortly after the release of Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive II, to spend more time with his family and to work on concert promotion, although his brothers claim that he was fired for breaking Randy Bachman's lifestyle rules on the road (including no alcohol and drugs).\\"Behind the Four-Wheel Drive.\\" Mark After Dark interview with Robbie Bachman at Newyorkwaste.com He was replaced by Blair Thornton. He rejoined BTO (along with Randy Bachman, Fred Turner and Garry Peterson) for a 1984 reunion album and supporting tours, including a high-profile world tour opening for Van Halen. He then led touring versions of the band in 1987 and 1988. Personal life Bachman is the father of blues/rock guitarist Paxton Bachman and the uncle of musician Tal Bachman, who is Randy Bachman's son. Bachman now lives in the Fraser Valley in British Columbia, Canada, and has worked as a realtor in Abbotsford since 1991. He was a director of the Fraser Valley Real Estate Board from 2003 to 2008. In 2008, Tim Bachman suffered a heart attack and subsequently underwent quadruple by-pass surgery. Sexual offence allegations On June 14, 2010, Bachman was charged by Abbotsford police with sexual interference of a person under 14, touching a young person for a sexual purpose, and sexual assault. Police recommended a charge of sexual exploitation, but Crown counsel opted to split the case into three separate counts.Carrigg, David. (Monday, June 14, 2010). Former BTO guitarist Tim Bachman charged in child-sex case. National Post (accessed June 14, 2010).(June 14, 2010). BTO guitarist charged with sex assault of minor: Tim Bachman faces charges of sexual touching, interference, assault, Cbc.ca, (accessed Monday, June 14, 2010). After an 11-month investigation, police charged Bachman for incidents that allegedly began in Abbotsford in 2000 when the complainant was 11 years old and continued for three years. Stacy Bohun alleged that Bachman would grope her when she was a foster child living in his home in the Fraser Valley. Bachman was found not guilty on these counts, as Justice Neill Brown ruled that the testimony of Bohun was too unreliable to support a criminal conviction. On May 26, 2014, Bachman was arrested again by Abbotsford police on new sex charges relating to incidents from the 1990s involving a different underaged victim. He faced charges of sexual assault, sexual interference and invitation to sexual touching. He was released pending trial on conditions which included avoiding contact with anyone under the age of 16, and avoiding any public park, schoolground, daycare, swimming pool or any other facility where minors under 16 may be present. Those charges were stayed on November 19, 2015. A representative of the Criminal Justice Branch could not provide any details regarding why the charges were stayed, but did state that this decision was reached while the prosecutor was preparing for the preliminary inquiry.

Career Atwater has spent much of his career studying the likelihood of large earthquakes and tsunamis in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. In 2005, he published a book with others, \\"The Orphan Tsunami of 1700,\\" that summarizes the evidence for an 8.7‚Äì9.2 megathrust earthquake in the Pacific Northwest on 26 January 1700, known as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The earthquake produced a tsunami so large that contemporary reports in Japan noted it, allowing Atwater's team to assign a precise date and approximate magnitude to the earthquake. Its occurrence and size are confirmed by evidence of a dramatic drop in the elevation of Northwest coastal land, recorded by buried marsh and forest soils that underlie tidal sediment, the deposition of a layer of tsunami sand on the subsided landscape, the death or injury of affected trees (see dendrochronology), and descriptions of the earthquake and tsunami in regional Amerindian legends. =Other works= Atwater has also authored various supporting papers about earthquakes around the Pacific Rim and about other geological topics including great glacial floods in Washington state, and the natural history of San Francisco Bay. In 2006 he began reconnaissance geologic mapping in coastal Indonesia, part of the ground-truth sleuthing needed to develop a \\"Smart System\\" for protecting Indian Ocean communities from future tsunamis. In 2015, Atwater appeared, as a geologist, in the PBS documentary film, Making North America.

Keep going. You have done a good job. Good luck.\\" Career As a youngster, Davis moved to Los Angeles, where he was a three- sport standout in baseball, basketball, and track and field at Theodore Roosevelt High School. He once ran a 9.5-second 100-yard dash, and set a city record in the long jump of 25 feet 5 inches (7.75 m).Crowe, Jerry \\"Few players were more exciting than Willie Davis\\" Los Angeles Times, Wednesday, March 10, 2010 Discovered by the Dodgers scout, Kenny Myers, Davis signed with the ballclub upon graduating from Roosevelt in 1958.\\"Statement from the Los Angeles Dodgers on the passing of Willie Davis (1940-2010)\\", Los Angeles Dodgers press release, Tuesday, March 9, 2010.

The novel presents a secret history of the Cold War, and earned several major fantasy fiction awards. Plot summary The non-linear plot, shifting back and forth in time from the 1940s to 1960s, mainly concerns Andrew Hale, a scholar and occasional operative for a secret British spy organization. Early in World War II, Hale is recruited as part of Operation Declare, an investigation of the true nature of several mysterious beings living on Mount Ararat, and how the Soviet Union has attempted to harness their vast supernatural powers. In this effort he is opposed by real-life communist traitor Kim Philby, a supporting character in the novel, who did travel extensively in the region. The novel proposes that the Great Game, the prolonged geopolitical conflict between the British and Russian empires in the 19th century over domination of Central Asia, was actually part of Operation Declare. The Okhrana, or Tsarist secret police, are cast as the Russian counterpart to Operation Declare. A sub-plot concerns Hale's on-off romance with Spaniard Elena Teresa Ceniza-Bendiga. A devoted Comintern agent and lapsed Catholic when she first meets Hale, Ceniza-Bendiga eventually rejects communism. While imprisoned in Moscow's notorious Lubyanka prison, she returns to her faith upon discovering the horrible motivation behind the deliberate mass starvation and violent political purges of Stalinist Russia: the placation of an entity called Zat al-Dawahi (\\"Mistress of Misfortunes\\") or Machikha Nash (\\"our stepmother\\"), a demonic being who demanded human sacrifice in exchange for protecting the nation from foreign invasion. Writing In a brief afterword, Powers discusses some of his sources and writing methods. Philby's father, St. John Philby, was a noted Arabist whose book The Empty Quarter (on the desert region Rub' al Khali) was extensively used as source material for the novel. Rudyard Kipling's 1901 novel Kim, about the Great Game, also supplied inspiration and epigraphs. Powers's self-imposed rules prohibited him from disregarding established historical facts and timelines, instead finding alternate explanations for events (e.g., a real-life 1883 earthquake near Mount Ararat is part of the novel's backstory; and a peripheral comment attributed to British Army officer T.E. Lawrence by playwright George Bernard Shaw is interpreted as proof of Lawrence's involvement in Operation Declare.) Reception In 2001 Declare won both the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel and the International Horror Guild Award for Best Novel, and was nominated for a Locus Award. It also appeared on the final ballot for the Nebula Award, however it was later determined to be ineligible because of the limited edition that appeared the year prior to the trade edition. It was published in the UK for the first time in 2010 and subsequently shortlisted for the 2011 Arthur C. Clarke Award for best science fiction novel.

Geology The Deschutes River carved a course through glacial debris left after the Pleistocene ice age until it reached volcanic bedrock, forming the falls as it coursed down to Puget Sound. History Lower Tumwater Falls emptying into Capitol Lake adjacent to the old Olympia Brewery Tumwater Falls was the site of New Market, the first European settlement in Western Washington. It was also the site of the now-defunct Olympia Brewing Company. Olympia Light and Power Company constructed a dam and a hydroelectric power plant at the falls in 1890, a decade before the Snoqualmie Falls powerplant outside Seattle. The plant powered an Olympia‚ÄìTumwater streetcar, among other things. A dam at above sea level created a head for the powerhouse and still stands on the Deschutes River. The Tumwater Falls created an impassable barrier to salmon until 1952, when a fish ladder was built by the Washington Department of Fisheries (now the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife), to provide salmon access to the newly constructed fish hatchery located immediately above the falls. Prior to the 1952 hatchery operations, the Deschutes river above the Tumwater Falls was a river system free of the influence of migrating and spawning salmon, an unusual ecological occurrence in the riparian systems of Puget Sound. In 1962, Olympia Brewing Company donated of land surrounding the falls to the Olympia-Tumwater Foundation, and Tumwater Falls Park was created. The park receives 200,000 visitors annually.

He studied business at Southern Methodist University, received a bachelor's degree in 1955 and served in the United States Air Force. CareerEarly career= In 1958, O'Neil started his career as a stockbroker at Hayden, Stone & Company, and developed an investment strategy which made early use of computers. In 1960, he was accepted to Harvard Business School's first Program for Management Development (PMD). From his research, O'Neil invented the CAN SLIM strategy and became the top-performing broker in his firm. He bought a seat on the NYSE at age 30 and became the youngest at that time ever to do so. In 1963, he founded William O'Neil + Co. Inc., a company which developed the first computerized daily securities database and sold its research to institutional investors and tracks over 70,000 companies worldwide. Daily Graphs was launched by William O'Neil to produce Daily Graphs, a printed book of stock charts delivered weekly to subscribers in 1972. In 1998, O'Neil launched Daily Graphs Online as a comprehensive online equity research tool and an extension of the Daily Graphs business he launched in 1972. In 2010, Daily Graphs Inc. and its service was re-branded as MarketSmith. In 1973, he founded \\"O'Neil Data Systems, Inc.\\", to provide high-speed printing and database-publishing facilities. The company now operates as O'Neil Digital Solutions and has operations in Los Angeles, Dallas and Monroe, North Carolina. The firm provides data-driven publishing and marketing communications. In 1988, O'Neil had a Mon-Fri stock market program on a Los Angeles UHF television station. KWHY-TV Channel 22 would broadcast the one- hour program with O'Neil holding center court. He would discuss the daily general market averages closing, why they closed as they did and what it might portend for the following trading day. The last fifteen minutes of the program were dedicated to the audience; a viewer could call the station, mention a stock they owned or were looking to purchase. O'Neil would bring up a chart on the TV screen of that stock and discuss its merits or caution the viewer. O'Neil would show a chart pattern and advise where to buy or sell. Also, early in the program, stocks that were highlighted were some of the Investor's Daily 200 stock list companies. =Investor's Business Daily= In 1984, O'Neil made research from his database available in print form with the launch of Investor's Daily, a national business newspaper aimed to compete with The Wall Street Journal. In 1991, the publication's name was changed from Investor's Daily to Investor's Business Daily. As of 2015, the newspaper had a circulation of 113,000 and its website attracted 2.9 million visitors a month. In 2016, the newspaper changed its printing schedule to weekly, but continued to publish news daily on its website. Personal life O'Neil is married and has four children. He stated in a 2002 interview that one of the books which was an early influence on him was Gerald Loeb's The Battle for Investment Survival. According to O'Neil, this is the best book on the market. Other investors which he took great interest in were Bernard Baruch, Jesse Livermore, Gerald M. Loeb, Jack Dreyfus, and Nicolas Darvas. He also greatly admired Thomas Edison. In 2007, O'Neil started donating to his alma mater, Southern Methodist University and funded a chair in business journalism at SMU's Meadows School of the Arts, he then endowed a professorship in markets and freedom and created the William J. O'Neil Center for Global Markets and Freedom at the university's Cox School of Business.

The station is owned by Entercom through licensee Entercom License, LLC and broadcasts a sports radio format. Studios are located at Foster Plaza near Green Tree (west of Pittsburgh) while the broadcast tower used by the station is located on Mount Washington, next to its former studios in Pittsburgh's South Shore neighborhood at (). KDKA-FM serves as the flagship station for the Pittsburgh Pirates Radio Network and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers IMG radio network. It broadcasts in the HD Radio format and simulcasts the news/talk programming of co-owned AM 1020 KDKA on its HD2 subchannel, while the national network feed of CBS Sports Radio is heard on its HD3 subchannel. KDKA-FM also carries CBS Sports Radio programming late nights and on weekends. History KDKA-FM's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD and EAS. =Early years= In 1948, the station signed on for the first time as WKJF-FM. In the earliest days of FM radio, while most were co-owned with an AM station, WKJF was an independently owned FM station. For a brief time, there was a co-owned UHF TV station, WKJF-TV (now WPGH-TV), which operated from 1953-54. WKJF changed its call sign to WKOI in 1973, and then to WJOI (standing for \\"Joy\\") in 1974.Broadcasting Yearbook 1974 page B-182 Through the 1960s and 1970s, the station programmed a beautiful music format. During the 1960s, Bill Hillgrove, who would later become a Pittsburgh sportscaster, was a staff member and hosted a Saturday night big band show titled \\"Stereo Dance Party.\\" In 1978, WJOI was acquired by EZ Communications, which primarily owned easy listening stations across the country.Broadcasting Yearbook 1979 page C-190 By the early 1980s, EZ Communications observed that the easy format was attracting an increasing number of older listeners, that were not sought after by most advertisers, and began to switch its stations to formats that would attract younger audiences. =WBZZ \\"B94\\"= At midnight on April 5, 1981, WJOI became WBZZ, using the moniker \\"B94.\\" The first song played after the format switch was \\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\\" by Billy Joel. B94 became Pittsburgh‚Äôs number one Top 40 station, tailoring its programming to not only a younger audience, but also a Pittsburgh audience, and quickly overtook its competitors, including WXKX and WPEZ.Billboard April 18, 1981 B94 was also an affiliate of The Rockin' America Top 30 Countdown with Scott Shannon throughout the 1980s, as well as Open House Party with John Garabedian during the 1990s. B94 featured local morning shows such as ‚ÄúQuinn and Banana\\" (hosted by Jim Quinn and \\"Banana\\" Don Jefferson) from its debut in 1983 until 1993, and ‚ÄúJohn, Dave, Bubba, Shelley‚Äù (hosted by John Cline, Dave Kaelin, Marc \\"Bubba\\" Snider and Shelley Duffy, along with some minor personality changes) from 1993 through 2004.http://old.post-gazette.com/tv/20030222tvnote0222p4.asp In addition, the station featured a mostly local air staff who were born and/or raised in the area. EZ Communications merged with American Radio Systems in July 1997, with ARS merging with Infinity Broadcasting (owned by CBS Radio) in September of that year. (Infinity was renamed CBS Radio in December 2005.) In 1998, the station relocated from its longtime studios on Mount Washington to Foster Plaza in Green Tree. KDKA-FM's tower atop Mount Washington In 2000, Clear Channel Communications unveiled a new Top 40 format on WKST-FM (the former WXKX), calling itself \\"KISS-FM.\\" The new station began to take a large chunk out of B94's audience. With more syndicated programming featuring national air talent and focusing more on the younger audience, B94, for the first time, saw itself slipping into second place. Also not helping matters was sister station WZPT switching to a Hot AC format at the same time, which, while it played a mix of 1980s and 1990s music with current hits, otherwise had a similar format to B94. On February 10, 2003, WBZZ rebranded as ‚Äú93-7 BZZ‚Äù. This was done as the station didn't want any confusion of exactly where it was on the radio dial, especially considering that the only station in Pittsburgh actually on the 94 range (WWSW-FM) had an oldies format. It was also done to re-image the station to compete with WKST, and because most radio stations sound out their exact frequency rather than rounding it due to the spread of digital tuners.https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2003/02/10/daily15.htmlhttp://old.post- gazette.com/tv/20030211radio0211fnp5.asp Later, in early 2004, the station tweaked its name again, calling itself \\"B93-7\\".https://www.fybush.com/nerw-20140714/ =The \\"K-Rock\\" years and \\"The Zone\\" experiment= In 2004, Clear Channel Communications cancelled The Howard Stern Show on its longtime Pittsburgh outlet WXDX-FM. In response, WBZZ operations manager Keith Clark decided to flip WBZZ‚Äôs format after 23 years, and not only wanted to pick up Howard Stern to improve the station's ratings, but also unveil a new active rock format known as \\"93-7 K-Rock\\" to compete with Clear Channel‚Äôs other Pittsburgh rock stations. At 8 a.m. on June 30, 2004, after briefly touting a major announcement, WBZZ‚Äôs on-air talent gathered to say goodbye to Pittsburgh, thanking the city for its support throughout the years. WBZZ ended the Top 40 format at 8:30 a.m. that day with \\"Move This\\" by Technotronic, while the first song on \\"K-Rock\\" was \\"For Those About To Rock\\" by AC/DC.http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2004/040712/nerw.html Stern returns to Pittsburgh radiohttp://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2004/06/28/daily35.htmlRadio & Records July 9, 2004 Shock jock sparks reformat; firing of morning DJs at WBZZ Listeners who were fans of WBZZ but didn't like the new rock format were encouraged to listen to sister station WZPT. The WBZZ call sign was replaced by WRKZ on July 7, 2004. Ratings for the station improved initially after the switch, but began to decline before Howard Stern's departure for Sirius Satellite Radio. Once Stern left, the station carried the syndicated David Lee Roth morning show. However, due to low ratings, Roth was replaced by the syndicated Opie and Anthony show less than three months after Roth's debut. The Kidd Chris afternoon drive time show, from co-owned WYSP in Philadelphia, aired on 93.7 from August 28, 2006 until March 19, 2007. On April 2, 2007, WRKZ became \\"93.7 The Zone,\\" and changed its call letters to WTZN-FM. This left Pittsburgh without an active rock station until WKVE in nearby Mount Pleasant flipped to active rock in 2009. WTZN-FM, although not carrying the \\"Free FM\\" name in its branding, was considered to be part of CBS's hot talk network by that name, which also included CBS FM stations in New York City, Los Angeles and other markets. Joining the lineup were Opie and Anthony, Pittsburgh native Dennis Miller, and former WDVE personality Scott Paulsen. The station also carried programming from Sporting News Radio (now SB Nation Radio). Miller and Paulsen were moved to 1020 KDKA when the hot talk format was abandoned. =Revival of B94= Logo for the revival of B94, used from October 2007 to February 2010 At 10 a.m. on October 1, 2007, after the Opie and Anthony Show ended, WTZN began stunting with Christmas music, in anticipation of a format flip scheduled for later that week.Radio station 93.7 dumps talk format after six months The station made some fairly obvious hints as to the future of the station, advertising \\"Something's missing in 'Pitts- urgh',\\" and asking, \\"What is missing in Pitts-urgh?\\" Listeners were prompted to go to www.pitts-urgh.com, where there was a message board asking \\"What do you miss the most about Pittsburgh?\\" Among the choices was \\"B94 Radio.\\" B94 returned to Pittsburgh the following Friday, October 5, at 5 p.m., with its first song being Justin Timberlake's \\"SexyBack.\\" B94 Returns This marked CBS Radio's first Top 40 switch after the failure of Free-FM. CBS would later launch the format in Houston, San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles, Detroit, Boston, Orlando and Philadelphia before 2017. The return of B94 was part of a CBS Radio initiative of resurrecting radio stations that had been killed off for other formats, such as WCBS-FM in New York and KFRC-FM in San Francisco. However, unlike those stations, which aired oldies/classic hits formats, B94 played current hits. On November 27, 2007, WTZN switched its call sign to WBZW-FM to reflect its new format. B94's former call sign, WBZZ, had been taken by an Adult Contemporary radio station in Malta, New York. That station is now WQBK-FM. CBS Radio later reacquired the call sign for use on WZPT. =Sportsradio 93.7 The Fan= On January 19, 2010, CBS Radio announced it would drop the B94 branding again, and would flip the format to sports talk, launching February 15 under the name \\"Sportsradio 93.7 The Fan\\". The Fan Blowing Into Pittsburgh The change was part of an initiative by CBS to establish FM sports talk stations across the country. The new sports station would compete with existing sports outlets ESPN Radio's WEAE and Fox Sports Radio affiliate WBGG. With this announcement, several of B94's DJs were relocated to sister station WZPT, \\"Star 100.7\\". Bubba and Melanie Taylor from the former B94 morning show shifted to WZPT, with Bubba joining J.R. Randall and Shelley Duffy on the \\"Star\\" morning show, and Melanie taking the midday shift. Mixshow coordinator and weekend host 'TJ the DJ' moved to weekends to develop 'The Party To Go' weekend mix show. Former WZPT midday DJ Scott Alexander moved to afternoons on \\"Star\\", prompting the exit of former \\"Star\\" afternoon personality Jonny Hartwell. Kobe, B94's afternoon jock and Music Director, and Flick, B94's night jock, were both released. (Flick eventually was rehired by CBS to host nights on \\"Star\\".) Midday guy Sean \\"Coop\\" Cooper was transferred to nights at CBS-owned WYCD in Detroit. On February 14, 93.7 began stunting with music played at sports events, also known as \\"Jock Jams\\", with B94 listeners being redirected to WZPT. The flip officially occurred at 6 a.m. on the 15th. Several station liners were also used (with a different branding) on sister stations WSCR in Chicago, WKRK-FM in Cleveland, and WFAN/WFAN-FM in New York. Debut of 93.7 The Fan The station adopted the KDKA- FM call sign on February 15, 2010. Many new CBS FM Sports stations took the same call letters as co-owned heritage AM or TV stations in their markets, including Boston's WBZ-FM, Philadelphia's WIP-FM, Baltimore's WJZ-FM, and Dallas' KRLD-FM. In this case, KDKA-FM took the call letters used by historic KDKA Radio since 1920. Even though the Federal Communications Commission does not usually grant call signs beginning with a \\"K\\" in the East, since those same call letters are on an existing grandfathered co-owned station, the KDKA- FM call sign was approved. (There had been a previous KDKA-FM in Pittsburgh owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting, which broadcast from the 1950s until 1979, mostly simulcasting KDKA at 92.9 MHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1957 page 228 Currently, it is separately owned WLTJ.) In 2012, KDKA-FM became the flagship station for the Pittsburgh Pirates Radio Network and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers IMG College Sports Network. KDKA-FM took over Pirates broadcasts from previous flagship WPGB. If Pitt and the Pirates are on at the same time, KDKA-FM airs the Panthers and KDKA carries the Pirates. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio agreed to merge with Entercom, becoming a separate, publicly-traded company under the Entercom name. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was completed on the 17th.

This technology is currently under development by many industrial and academic research groups. Method of operation 150px Like all types of OLED, phosphorescent OLEDs emit light due to the electroluminescence of an organic semiconductor layer in an electric current. Electrons and holes are injected into the organic layer at the electrodes and form excitons, a bound state of the electron and hole. Electrons and holes are both fermions with half integer spin. An exciton is formed by the coulombic attraction between the electron and the hole, and it may either be in a singlet state or a triplet state, depending on the spin states of these two bound species. Statistically, there is a 25% probability of forming a singlet state and 75% probability of forming a triplet state. Decay of the excitons results in the production of light through spontaneous emission. In OLEDs using fluorescent organic molecules only, the decay of triplet excitons is quantum mechanically forbidden by selection rules, meaning that the lifetime of triplet excitons is long and phosphorescence is not readily observed. Hence it would be expected that in fluorescent OLEDs only the formation of singlet excitons results in the emission of useful radiation, placing a theoretical limit on the internal quantum efficiency (the percentage of excitons formed that result in emission of a photon) of 25%. However, phosphorescent OLEDs generate light from both triplet and singlet excitons, allowing the internal quantum efficiency of such devices to reach nearly 100%. This is commonly achieved by doping a host molecule with an organometallic complex. These contain a heavy metal atom at the centre of the molecule, for example platinum or iridium, of which the green emitting complex Ir(mppy)3 is just one of many examples. The large spin-orbit interaction experienced by the molecule due to this heavy metal atom facilitates intersystem crossing, a process which mixes the singlet and triplet character of excited states. This reduces the lifetime of the triplet state, therefore phosphorescence is readily observed. Applications Due to their potentially high level of energy efficiency, even when compared to other OLEDs, PHOLEDs are being studied for potential use in large-screen displays such as computer monitors or television screens, as well as general lighting needs. One potential use of PHOLEDs as lighting devices is to cover walls with large area PHOLED light panels. This would allow entire rooms to glow uniformly, rather than require the use of light bulbs which distribute light unequally throughout a room. The United States Department of Energy has recognized the potential for massive energy savings via the use of this technology and therefore has awarded $200,000 USD in contracts to develop PHOLED products for general lighting applications. Challenges One problem that currently hampers the widespread adoption of this highly energy efficient technology is that the average lifetimes of red and green PHOLEDs are often tens of thousands of hours longer than those of blue PHOLEDs. This may cause displays to become visually distorted much sooner than would be acceptable for a commercially viable device.

The attack led to heightened security in the DC metropolitan area, and the inaccessibility of certain parts of the Senate Building. Six members of the radical left-wing Resistance Conspiracy were arrested in May 1988 and charged with the bombing, as well as related bombings of Fort McNair and the Washington Navy Yard which occurred April 25, 1983, and April 20, 1984, respectively.  Background  In October 1983, the United States military invaded the socialist island nation of Grenada and replaced the socialist government with the previous government under Governor-General Paul Scoon and Chairman of the Interim Advisory Council Nicholas Brathwaite, the country having been a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. At the time, the invasion was supported by 64% of the US population. However, members of the left wing militant group, the Resistance Conspiracy, were perturbed. The invasion of Grenada, coupled with the October 1983 bombing of a United States Marines barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, prompted the beginnings of a plan for the left-wing militants to take action. Members of the group felt the United States, led by President Ronald Reagan, had no business meddling in the affairs of Middle Eastern nations or small socialist island states. Thus it was decided to bring awareness to their ideals by bombing the US Senate on November 7, 1983.  Bombing of the U.S. Capitol  On November 7, 1983, the Senate adjourned at 7:02 p.m. A crowded reception, held near the Senate Chamber, broke up two hours later. At 10:58 p.m., an explosion tore through the second floor of the Capitol's north wing; the adjacent halls were virtually deserted. Minutes before the blast, a caller claiming to represent the \\"Armed Resistance Unit\\" warned the Capitol switchboard that a bomb had been placed near the Chamber in retaliation for recent U.S. military involvement in Grenada and Lebanon, in which the U.S. had placed Marines. The \\"Armed Resistance Unit\\" plotted to murder Henry Kissinger.William Rosenau, The Dark History of America‚Äôs First Female Terrorist Group; The women of May 19th bombed the U.S. Capitol and plotted Henry Kissinger‚Äôs murder. But they‚Äôve been long forgotten. May 3, 2020 Politico The force of the device, hidden under a bench at the eastern end of the corridor outside the Chamber, blew off the door to the office of Democratic Leader Robert C. Byrd. Senator Byrd was an active supporter of involvement in Grenada, and had recently made attempts to garner support for retaliating against recent attacks against U.S. Marines stationed in Lebanon. His recent actions may have drawn attention from the terrorist group, and led to his targeting. Furthermore, the blast also punched a hole in a wall partition, sending a shower of pulverized brick, plaster, and glass into the Republican cloakroom. The explosion caused no structural damage to the Capitol. The force shattered mirrors, chandeliers, and furniture. Officials calculated damages of $250,000 (). A portrait of Daniel Webster which was located near the concealed bomb, received most of the force of the blast. The image of Webster's face was damaged, and canvas shards of it were strewn across the floor. Members of the Senate recovered fragments of the painting from debris-filled trash bins. A conservator worked for months to restore the painting to a semblance of the original.  Resistance Conspiracy  The group Resistance Conspiracy was a United States-based branch of the wider communist organization known as the May 19th Communist Order. This group existed from its first attack in 1976 until later attacks in 1985. Throughout the lifespan of the organization, twenty incidents of terror were committed including one fatality inflicted. Most of the incidents involved bombings and sabotage, however several also included scare tactics such as threats and the utilization of fake weapons. The organization is also known as the Armed Resistance Unit, the Red Guerilla Resistance, and the Revolutionary Fighting Group. Earlier in that year on April 25, 1983, a small bomb detonated at the National War College at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. A call coming into UPI in advance of the attack mentioned \\"U.S. imperialism.\\" The National War College is where American military officials get high-level training. Following the attack, it was immediately sealed off. Of the device causing the explosion, Col. Jamie Walton of the Army remarked that it appeared to be 5 to 10 pounds of unknown explosives detonated by some sort of timing device. Colonel Walton also reported no injuries were incurred, although there was superficial damage to the outside of the building. A year later, on April 24, 1984, the a group calling itself the Guerilla Resistance Movement took responsibility for a bombing at the Officer's Club at the Washington Navy Yard. Their reasons for the bombing were opposition to U.S. policy in Central America and independence for Puerto Rico. The explosion at the officers club occurred at 1:50 A.M. An F.B.I. spokesman said it appeared to have been caused by a powerful bomb that was placed under a couch in an entryway to the club. The explosion blew out windows, knocked down part of a false ceiling and damaged the interior of the three-story, red-brick club building. There was nobody in the building at the time of the bombing and no one was injured. The effect of this bombing led to heightened focus on anti terrorism operations in the United States, and eventually led to the group's takedown four years later in 1988.  Aftermath  Within minutes of the explosion, more than a dozen fire trucks and four ambulances raced up to the west front of the Capitol while officers with police dogs began combing the area for clues. Witnesses attested to a loud blast which they could hear, and smoke at the Capitol, which they could see. A group calling itself Armed Resistance Unit claimed responsibility for the bombing. The group mailed a recorded communique to National Public Radio stating, \\"We purposely aimed our attack at the institutions of imperialist rule rather than at individual members of the ruling class and government. We did not choose to kill any of them this time. But their lives are not sacred.\\" After a four and a half years investigation, federal agents arrested six members of the Resistance Conspiracy, on May 12, 1988, and charged them with bombings of the Capitol, Fort McNair, and the Washington Navy Yard. On December 7, 1990, Federal Judge Harold H. Greene sentenced Laura Whitehorn and Linda Evans to lengthy prison terms for conspiracy and malicious destruction of government property. The Court dropped charges against three co-defendants, who already served extended prison sentences for related crimes. Whitehorn was sentenced to 20 years; Evans, to 5 years, concurrent with 35 years for illegally buying guns. On January 20, 2001, the day he left office, President Bill Clinton commuted Evans's sentence. The 1983 bombing marked the beginning of tightened security measures throughout the Capitol. The area outside the Senate Chamber, previously open to the public, was permanently closed.

Along with David Caminer, he designed England's first business computer, the LEO computer, produced by J. Lyons and Co in 1951. Personal life John Pinkerton was educated at King Edward's School, Bath, and Clifton College, Bristol.\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p475: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge from 1937 to 1940, reading Natural Sciences, and graduating with first class honours. He joined the Air Ministry Research Establishment in Swanage, to work on radar, and went with it to Malvern where it was renamed the Telecommunications Research Establishment (where he met Maurice Wilkes). He returned to Cambridge as a research student at the Cavendish Laboratory. In 1948 he married Helen McCorkindale. They had a son and a daughter. Colleagues describe him as having \\"a disarming way of listening intently to what others said\\", a \\"quiet, dry sense of humour\\", a \\"fine, critical, but constructive intelligence\\", \\"an enviable ability to handle detail\\", and \\"friendliness and kindness\\". They also mention his knowledge of music and English literature and his lively appreciation of good food. J. Lyons The catering firm of J. Lyons was known in the high street for its tea and cakes; in the business world it was known for its innovative approach to supply chain management. As early as 1947 the firm decided that the future lay with computers, and since nothing suitable was available, they resolved to build one. They approached Wilkes in Cambridge, who suggested that they construct a copy of the EDSAC machine, and introduced them to Pinkerton whom they recruited as chief engineer. Pinkerton's approach was to leave the design unchanged as far as possible, while improving reliability by identifying the points of failure (notably electronic valves) and developing test procedures that enabled component failures to be anticipated and prevented. The machine went into operation in early 1951, and was used to its full capacity by 1954, at which point the company decided to build a second machine. They also saw the potential in building computers for use by other companies, and in 1955 set up a subsidiary, LEO Computers Ltd, with Pinkerton as technical director. In this capacity he was responsible for the development of the successor machines LEO II and LEO III. By 1961 it was clear that the company did not have the resources to build its own computers indefinitely, so Lyons sold the operation to English Electric.  English Electric and ICL  Pinkerton was appointed head of research in English Electric Computers, which went through a series of mergers eventually becoming part of ICL in 1968. In the 1970s Pinkerton, together with Conway Berners-Lee, developed and applied a queuing network model for optimising the price/performance of the new ICL's 'New Range' of computers (later the ICL 2900 Series). It was known as FAST ‚Äì standing for Football Analogy for System Throughput. He remained with the company until his retirement in 1984, in a variety of product strategy roles. Maurice Wilkes wrote,Obituary, ICL Systems Journal Vol 12 Issue 2, Nov 1997, available online at \\"it is a sad fact that, although he remained active in ICL at a senior level, he never found a role that in any way matched his track record or gave full scope for his abilities.\\" He served for many years as president of ECMA, the European Computer Manufacturers' Association, helping to build it into an organisation respected for the quality and timeliness of its work.  Retirement  In retirement Pinkerton was one of the original court members (from 1988) of the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists and \\"the mainspring of their Apprenticeship Scheme\\". He was also editor of a series of technical books. He edited the ICL Technical Journal between 1990 and 1996. His predecessor, Jack Howlett, commented: \\"John took the task of editing the journal with great seriousness, energy, and enthusiasm, and spared no effort in ensuring that the papers for each issue... met his exacting standards for content, presentation, and written English. He was very good indeed at discussing the content and form of a possible paper with a potential author, and, with an experienced author, ... helping to sort out the essential ideas and put them in the right logical order.\\" He also frequently intervened with the managers of potential authors to allocate time and recognition for this activity. He also made contributions to documenting the history of computing, for example through the Science Museum's recorded interviews with UK pioneers.

The company was formed in 1865 and produced locomotives and carried out general engineering work until 1965. They mainly built shunting engines for the British market, but also built main line engines for overseas customers. Steam locomotives were built from 1865 to 1956 and diesel locomotives from 1950 to 1965. The early years The idea of a locomotive builder based near Sheffield was first suggested in 1864 by W. G. Eden, who later became the fourth Baron Auckland. At the time, Eden was Chairman of the South Yorkshire Railway, and a director of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MSLR), posts which he had taken up after retiring as a diplomat. He invited Archibald Sturrock, who was employed by the Great Northern Railway as its locomotive engineer, to be the Chairman of the new company. Alfred Sacr√© would be the Managing Director, and his older brother, Charles, then the Engineer and Locomotive Superintendent for the MSLR, was also part of the team. By April 1865 investors had promised ¬£120,000 towards the estimated cost of ¬£200,000 for setting up the company. Although Sturrock joined the board in May 1866, he did not become chairman until January 1867. A site near Blackburn Meadows was chosen for the works. Construction and the procurement of machinery began in mid-1865, and Meadowhall Works was virtually complete in May 1867, by which time all of the 2,000 shares had been taken up. The first order received was for three 2-2-2 locomotives for the Great Northern Railway. The specification was changed and they were supplied with a 2-4-0 wheel arrangement. They were delivered two months late, the last in February 1867, and the company made a loss on them, largely because the works was not yet complete. An order for ten more followed, which were also delivered late. The first was two months late, but the final one was eight months overdue by the time it was delivered in March 1869. Next came orders for fifty 0-6-0 locomotives for two Indian railways, but then demand tailed off. In order to keep the workforce together, other work was undertaken, including armour plated shields, lamp posts for the Chief Constable of Sheffield, and 10,000 safes. Orders from three Russian railways kept the works busy, but difficulties in obtaining payment resulted in cash- flow problems. The original directors all resigned in 1871. Locomotives were supplied to Argentina, Australia and Japan, and a number of small 0-4-0 saddle tanks were supplied to local collieries. The company continued to take on general engineering work to supplement the building of locomotives for most of its existence. A modest profit was made in 1871, following serious losses in the previous two years. The building of locomotives to Robert Fairlie's patent started at the end of that year. Between 1872 and 1883, thirteen were supplied to the Mexican Railway in three batches. They were 0-6-6-0 double ended machines, and the middle batch had Walschaerts valve gear, believed to be the first time that this design was built in Britain. The Mexican locomotives were capable of burning coal or wood as a fuel, while two supplied to Sweden burnt peat. The peat burners were not a success and were rebuilt at four 2-4-0 saddle tanks. An order for ten Fairlies received in 1873 for nitrate railways in Peru were built, but were not shipped because payment was not received. Four went to the Trancaucasian Railway near the Black Sea, and six were eventually shipped to a new Nitrate Railway Company in 1882. They had a 2-6-6-2 wheel arrangement, and at 85 tons each, Engineering reported that they were the heaviest locomotives in the world in 1885. An attempt to build marine engines and traction engines to patents by Loftus Perkins was less successful. When purchasers pulled out, Perkins sued the company, which lost ¬£34,532 on the venture. A joint venture with Perkins for the construction of tramway engines was also a failure. When there was insufficient work, the company built 0-4-0 saddle tanks for stock, which enabled collieries and engineering works to buy locomotives off the shelf. This practice continued throughout the life of the company. By 1880, the company was in serious financial difficulties. The Russian debts were never paid, and a dubious method was used to write off the loss made on the marine engines. Despite a successful call to shareholders for more money, the company chose voluntary liquidation as the best option in July 1880. Liquidators ran the business for three and a half years, during which time turnover increased and profits of ¬£9,419 were made. In September 1883, the second Yorkshire Engine Company was launched, by issuing 2,400 shares valued at ¬£25, giving a capital of ¬£60,000. Few locomotive manufacturers were profitable at the time. Early YEC locomotives produced for the UK market consisted mainly of 0-4-0ST and 0-6-0ST types. The style of these was typical of small locomotives of the time with the so-call ‚Äòogee‚Äô tanks and very little protection for the driver. That did not stop early locomotives surviving with industrial users until the 1950s. The collieries and steelworks of Yorkshire were regular customers, with five narrow gauge locomotives going to the Chattenden and Upnor Railway, a military railway in Kent. The 1890s saw YEC building locomotives for Chile, Peru and India. They also built a single electric locomotive for the British War Office. Mainline engines YEC undertook orders for mainline locomotive for the UK and overseas countries. Locomotives were built for the Great Northern Railway, Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the Great Eastern Railway. In 1874, an order for 13 F class locomotives was dispatched to New Zealand. Two of these engines survived into preservation. * F12 at Ferrymead Railway, in a derelict state, * F180 \\"Meg Merriles\\" at Auckland's Museum of Transport and Technology, in static restored condition. Fifty years after being built, the builder's photo of F180 was included in an advertisement for the Yorkshire Engine Company, in a 1924 edition of Railway Magazine. In 1901 four locomotives were built for use on the Metropolitan Railway main line to Aylesbury. These were F Class 0-6-2Ts and survived for around 60 years, the first being scrapped on 1957 and the last in 1964. More orders from the Metropolitan Railway followed in 1915 and 1916 for larger G Class 0-6-4Ts. Unlike the F Class, the G Class locomotives passed to the LNER on 1 November 1937, when that company became responsible for providing motive power for trains north of Rickmansworth, and the locomotives only lasted in service for 30 years. 1928 saw the LNER get locomotives delivered directly from Sheffield. These nine locomotives (LNER 2682 to 2690) were Class N2 0-6-2Ts for working suburban trains. Along with a number of other private builders, YEC built a batch of GWR 5700 Class 0-6-0PTs in 1929/1930. Between 1949 and 1956 50 GWR 9400 Class 0-6-0PTs were built for British Railways (BR). The last of these, BR No. 3409 (YE2584 of 1956), was the last steam locomotive built at Meadowhall and the last BR locomotive to be built to a pre-nationalisation design. The order for these locomotives had been given to the Hunslet Engine Company in Leeds but as they were already busy, the work was sub-contracted to Sheffield. Far bigger than anything built for use in Britain were the export locomotives. 2-8-2 and 4-8-2 tender locomotives for South America. Car production During 1907 Yorkshire Engine Co. started to build motor cars, branded as 'YEC'. These were not a success and very few were produced. Miniature locomotives The Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway \\"Mainline in Miniature\\" built by Captain Howey was, and still is, well known for its fleet of engines built by Davy Paxman and based on the locomotives of Nigel Gresley. A flaw with these designs was shown up when the railway started running to Dungeness through the winter - a lack of protection for the driver. Captain Howey and Henry Greenly started work on a pair of 4-6-2 locomotives based on Canadian designs, with larger, better protected, cabs. While Howey was in Australia, Greenly quarrelled with the management and engineers of the railway, before destroying the working drawings and departing. The parts, including boilers, wheels and cylinders were shipped to the Yorkshire Engine Co. and the locomotives were completed in Sheffield. It is assumed that all the detailed design works was done by the company based on a few sketches drawn by Captain Howey. YE 2294 and 2295 are better known as No. 9 Winston Churchill and No.10 Doctor Syn; they are still running (other than when being overhauled) and are the best known of any Yorkshire Engine Co. locomotives. United Steel Companies and diesel locomotive development The business was bought by the United Steel Companies Limited (USC) on 29 June 1945. USC needed replacement locomotives so it made sense to buy a manufacturer (at the right price) and the idea had been put forward of developing a central engineering workshop for their steelworks at Templeborough (Rotherham) and Stocksbridge. Both works were being expanded and redeveloped, and were easily accessible by rail from the YEC works. In the post war climate, the YEC management were willing to sell. Following the purchase, work began on building steam locomotives for the internal rail systems at several steelworks as well as ironstone mines around Britain. YEC continued to build locomotives for other customers, just as they had before the takeover. The design for a modern 0-6-0ST locomotive was bought from Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns and locomotives of this type were built for steel works, primarily as replacements for locomotives worn out during the Second World War. This design was undoubtedly chosen because a number were already in use at Appleby-Frodingham works, Scunthorpe and given various type names (these include \\"Type 1\\", \\"16inch\\" and \\"Group 17\\"). A small number of locomotives were built for ironstone mines to a War Department ‚ÄòAusterity‚Äô design. It is believed that the use of this design was connected with the sub-contract of other locomotive construction from Hunslet Engine Company. YE 2481 at Kelham Island Museum in 2005 In 1950 a diesel-electric locomotive was built for use in the melting shop of Templeborough steelworks. The duty had special requirements for a locomotive to fit through a small opening and around tight curves while being powerful enough to haul heavy ‚ÄòCasting Cars‚Äô. The weight of the locomotive had to be high to give better grip. The design featured a Paxman engine and British Thompson-Houston electric equipment powering and 0-4-0 chassis. The first locomotive (Works number 2480) left the works at the end of 1950 with a second (No. 2481) leaving in early 1951. No.2480 was displayed and demonstrated before final delivery while No.2481 was delivered direct from the works (a journey of about 1 mile). Both locomotives survived to be preserved in the late 1980s. No other locomotives were built to this design. Production diesel-electric locomotives It was 2 years before another diesel locomotive was built but during this time the diesel-electric design was refined and YEC were soon marketing four designs all based on engines and electrical equipment similar to the first diesel locomotives. *DE1 ‚Äì 0-4-0, 240 hp, 37 tons, 25 mph *DE2 ‚Äì 0-4-0, 275 hp, 45 tons, 22 mph *DE3 ‚Äì 0-4-0, 400 hp, 50 tons, 25 mph *DE4 ‚Äì 0-6-0, 400 hp, 51 tons, 27 mph (not every locomotive was built to these exact details) The DE2 design was popular with steelworks and continued to be built until 1965. Small numbers of the DE1 and DE4 were built but were superseded in 1955 and 1956 by new designs with Rolls- Royce engines. No locomotives were built to the DE3 design, probably because they were too big and heavy for use on normal railway work. Rolls-Royce engines Typical Janus locomotive at a steelworks When Rolls-Royce Diesels introduced their C range engine, it was adopted by locomotive builders for use in Diesel-hydraulic locomotives. These benefited from having a faster running engine (1800 rpm). Likewise, YEC used the C series engines in a new range of locomotives, the first of which was introduced in 1955 and which continued to evolve until 1965, the higher engine speed being an advantage for diesel- electric locomotives as well. Generally the diesel locomotives built with Rolls-Royce engines shared many design features ‚Äì rounded engine covers (bonnets) narrow enough to permit walkways to be put down each side; four cab windows overlooking the engine; fuel tanks and/or battery boxes built into the running boards; walkways or balconies at each end; access to the cab from a walkway or balcony. None of the Rolls-Royce engined locomotives were given class/type numbers but several were given names. The first to be given a name was the ‚ÄòJanus‚Äô. This design was symmetrical with two engines (C6SFL rated at 200 hp each) and a central cab. The name was appropriate as Janus was a Roman god with two faces. ‚ÄòTaurus‚Äô, ‚ÄòIndus‚Äô and ‚ÄòOlympus‚Äô designs were produced which had many similarities in style. Diesel-hydraulics and locomotives for British Railways One of the first YEC Diesel Hydraulic locomotives built for industrial use Around 1960, the first diesel-hydraulic were produced. Other builders had shown that a type of hydraulic transmission, called a ‚Äòmulti- stage torque converter‚Äô, was cheap to buy, needed very little maintenance and was very easy to use. YEC immediately found customers for these locomotives and increased the number of designs available. In 1960 and 1961 batches of 180 hp locomotives, totalling 20, were built for British Railways. These were very closely related to the standard small diesel-hydraulic locomotives but with a few modifications to suit their use on a main line railway (different arrangement of fuel tanks, vacuum train brake system and marker lights). These locomotives were later designated Class 02. At least three YEC locomotives were demonstrated or given trials on British Railways between 1956 and 1963, these were a Janus, a Taurus and a 300 hp diesel-hydraulic Yorkshire Engine Co built the chassis and bodies of the 10 prototype Class 15 locomotives under contract from British Thomson Houston Co Ltd (BTH) Exports to India Yorkshire Engine Co had been exporting steam locomotives to India for most of their existence, but in 1958 ten broad gauge ( ) 230-hp 0-4-0 diesel-electric shunting locomotives were supplied for the construction of Durgapur Steel Works in Eastern India. This was followed in 1963‚Äì64 with five 300-hp 0-4-0 diesel-electric locomotives and ten 600-hp ‚ÄòOlympus‚Äô Bo-Bo locomotives. The Durgapur works was developed in conjunction with United Steel Companies, so it is not surprising that YEC locomotives were used there. In addition, YEC secured an order for two metre-gauge ‚ÄòJanus‚Äô locomotives for the Indian Fertilizer Corporation. Closure and life after death Locomotive construction ended in 1965. It is not recorded exactly why the works was closed but three facts seem to have all had an influence on the decision. Firstly the market for new locomotives was shrinking rapidly with a number of other manufacturers closing around this time. Secondly, most of the USC works were fully equipped with YEC locomotives. Thirdly, nationalisation of the British steel industry was to take place in 1967 and it is unlikely that the locomotive business was wanted as part of the new corporation. Several locomotives under construction at the time of closure left the works before they had been completed. These locomotives were destined for USC steelworks which had the capability to complete the construction work in their own engineering works. The rights to the YEC designs and the good will of the business were sold to Rolls-Royce ‚ÄòSentinel Division‚Äô at Shrewsbury who had previously supplied a high proportion of diesel engines used by YEC and were a competitor in the industrial locomotive market. In 1967 three locomotives were bought from Shrewsbury for use at Scunthorpe Steelworks, these were built to the Janus design to match the many similar locomotives there built in Sheffield. A fourth locomotive, to a different YEC design, was supplied to AEI in Manchester. When Rolls-Royce hit financial problems in 1971 they stopped all locomotive work and the YEC designs, along with those for Rolls-Royce locomotives passed to Thomas Hill at Kilnhurst, near Rotherham who had been agents for Rolls-Royce for some time. (Thomas Hill built three locos to Yorkshire design, for the Durgapur Steel Works in Eastern India). The former Yorkshire Engine Company works at Meadowhall, Sheffield, was transferred to McCall and Company another part of the United Steel Companies group. Reinforcing bars (for concrete) were produced here. The works passed to Rom River Reinforements in the mid-1990s but was closed early in the 21st century when the roof of the main building was deemed to be beyond repair. Subsequently the works has been completely refurbished and is now (2009) occupied by the engineering firm of Chesterfield Special Cylinders Locomotives returned to the site on a regular basis between 1988 and 2001 when the South Yorkshire Railway Preservation Society used the few remaining railway lines in the Meadowhall works to load and unload preserved locomotives that were moved by lorry (the lines between the buildings were set into the roadway). A number of these locomotives were products of Yorkshire Engine Company, including YE2480, the first diesel locomotive they built.

This new company was again in the industrial locomotive business but with efforts concentrated on hiring locomotives to industrial users and also undertaking rebuilds and re-engining work on existing locomotive. The new YEC went into receivership in 2001 and ceased trading. The yard was based on the army camp at Long Marston, which by 2007 was being used for storage of locomotives and rolling stock, both for preservation groups and commercial organisations.

He has published several books, the most notable of which are El Descontrol de Precios (\\"The unbalance of prices\\") and La Lata del Domingo (\\"Sunday's Drag\\"). Unlike most Mexican cartoonists, Mr. Calderon sternly supports free market economics and policies. Due to his criticism of the Mexican Left and its leader Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, the latter dubbed him \\"monero de la derecha\\" (\\"right-wing doodler\\").

Life He was born about 1660, the eldest son of Alexander, 8th Earl of Eglinton and Lady Elizabeth Crichton, eldest daughter of William, 2nd Earl of Dumfries. From the time of the death of his grandfather, Hugh, in 1669 he was boarded with Matthew Fleming, the minister of Culross, Perthshire, who superintended his education at the school of Culross until 1673, when he was sent to the University of St. Andrews, where he remained till Lammas 1676. A few months after leaving the university he married Lady Margaret Cochrane, eldest daughter of William Cochrane, Lord Cochrane, the son of the William Cochrane, 1st Earl of Dundonald, on which occasion his father made over to him the Eglinton estates. Montgomerie was a keen freemason. After the revolution he was chosen a privy counsellor by King William, and also a lord commissioner of the treasury. In 1700, he obtained a letter from the king to sit and vote in the Scots parliament in place of the lord high treasurer. He succeeded to the earldom on the death of his father in 1701. On Queen Anne's accession in 1702, Eglinton was chosen a privy counsellor, and in 1711 he was named one of the commissioners of the chamberlain's court. In 1710, and again in 1713, he was elected one of the Scottish representative peers. Lockhart, who was his son-in-law, states that when he himself proposed to bring in a bill for resuming the bishops' revenues in Scotland, and applying them to the episcopal clergy there, Eglinton gave his support to the measure, and assured Queen Anne that the presbyterians would not actively oppose it. This is corroborated by Wodrow, who asserts that Lockhart, either in the House of Peers or in the privy council, proposed 'that as we are one in civil we should be one in church matters'. Wodrow also states that his speech on patronage and toleration was 'so very good' that it was supposed 'it was done by somebody for him'. In June 1712, he also proposed a bill for prolonging the time for taking the oath of abjuration till 1 November. Lockhart affirms that Eglinton at last professed himself a Jacobite, and promised him three thousand guineas 'to help the Pretender in his restoration'. Wodrow also relates that shortly before the rebellion in 1715 Eglinton was at a meeting of the Jacobites where the rebellion, as to the manner of carrying out, was concerted, and heard all their proposals'. Nevertheless, during the crisis he raised and disciplined the Ayrshire fencibles, with which on 22 August he joined the Earls of Kilmarnock and Glasgow and Lord Semple at Irvine in support of the government. He died suddenly at Eglinton on 18 February 1729. Between nine hundred and a thousand beggars are stated to have attended his funeral, ¬£50 being divided among them. He was succeeded by his son, Alexander Montgomerie, 10th Earl of Eglinton. Wives and children Susanna Montgomery, third wife of the 9th Earl. Eglinton was married three times. By his first wife, Margaret Cochrane, he had three sons and six daughters : *Hugh, Lord Montgomerie, died in 1696; *Alexander, died young; *John, died young; *Catherine, married to James, fifth earl of Galloway ; *Elizabeth, died young ; *Jean, died young ; *Euphemia, married to George Lockhart of Carnwath ; *Grace, to Robert, fifth Earl of Carnwath ; *Jean, to Sir Alexander Maxwell of Monreith, Wigtownshire.

Much of the series' religious humor satirizes aspects of Christianity and religion in general. However, some episodes, such as \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\" and \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\", can be interpreted as having a spiritual theme. The show has been both praised and criticized by atheists, agnostics, liberals, conservatives and religious people in general for its portrayal of faith and religion in society. The show can function as a mediator of biblical literacy among younger generations of irreligious viewers. In the series, the Simpson family attends services led by Reverend Lovejoy. The church's denomination is identified as the \\"Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism\\" in the episode \\"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star.\\" This is generally interpreted as representing the multitude of American Protestant traditions in general and not one specific denomination. Analysis Although The Simpsons often mocks religion, it has received support from some groups claiming to be religious. In a 2001 article for The Christian Century, John Dart argued that > \\"[T]he enormous popularity of The Simpsons, now in its 12th television > season, suggests that religious people have a sense of humor ‚Äî contrary to > the usual wisdom in Hollywood. The program takes more satirical jabs at > spiritual matters than any other TV show, yet the erratic cartoon family has > an appreciative audience among many people of faith and among many analysts > of religion. The reason? Perhaps it‚Äôs because The Simpsons is an equal- > opportunity satire: it shrewdly targets all sorts of foibles and > hypocrisies, not just religious ones. Perhaps it‚Äôs also because the show is > exceptionally aware of the significant place religion has in the American > landscape.\\" The February 5, 2001 edition of Billy Graham's Christianity Today, titled Saint Flanders, featured Ned Flanders, Homer, and Marge on the cover and described Flanders as \\"the most visible evangelical to many Americans.\\" In one of the issue's articles, Dart argued, among other things, that \\"At home, the less devout are probably tuned to the competition, Touched by an Angel.\\" In July 2007, Christianity Today film reviewer Russ Breimeier gave The Simpsons Movie a positive review, stating \\"Most television shows don't translate well to the big screen, and that's especially true for 15- or 30-minute cartoons that don't have the depth or nuance to expand into feature length. But The Simpsons, with its broad range of slapstick and satire, effortlessly stretches to four times the usual length of a 22-minute episode, yielding one of the most successful television-to-cinema transplants I've ever seen: \\"Best ‚Ä¶ feature-length ‚Ä¶ episode ‚Ä¶ ever\\" and that \\"If you agree that The Simpsons has soured somewhat over the last five years, fear not. The Simpsons Movie reunites several of the veterans responsible for the golden age of the series, including creator Matt Groening, director David Silverman (Monsters, Inc.), and contributing writers James L. Brooks, Al Jean, John Swartzwelder, David Mirkin, Ian-Maxtone-Graham, among others‚Äîeleven writers, four consultants.\\" On December 2009, an article published in L'Osservatore Romano, the Holy See's official newspaper, praised The Simpsons for its \\"realistic\\" way of dealing with religion. \\"Homer finds in God his last refuge, even though he sometimes gets His name sensationally wrong. But these are just minor mistakes, after all; the two know each other well\\", the article said.\\"Vatican praises 'The Simpsons'\\". Business Standard. December 26, 2009. The Simpson family is often seen attending church, a practice described by Dart as \\"rarely seen or mentioned in other TV shows.\\" Simpsons creator Matt Groening has also stated that The Simpsons is one of the few shows on television where the family attends church regularly. The characters in the family are often seen praying. William Romanowski, author of the book Pop Culture Wars: Religion and the Role of Entertainment in American Life, noted that \\"The Simpsons is not dismissive of faith, but treats religion as an integral part of American life. Episodes that I‚Äôve seen are not so much irreverent toward religion, but poke fun at American attitudes and practices.\\" One episode that heavily features religion is \\"Bart Sells His Soul\\" (1995). While discussing The Simpsons treatment of religion in his Drawn to Television book, M. Keith Booker cites a scene from the episode where Milhouse asks Bart what religions have to gain by lying about concepts such as the existence of a soul ‚Äì and then the scene cuts to Reverend Lovejoy counting his money. Booker believes that this implies that religions create mythologies so that they can gain money from followers. He juxtaposes this with Bart's realization later in the episode that \\"life suddenly feels empty and incomplete\\" without a soul, which suggests \\"either that the soul is real or it is at least a useful fiction\\". The episode has been used in church courses about the nature of a soul in Connecticut and in the United Kingdom, and was shown by a minister in Scotland in one of his sermons. (archived at AccessMyLibrary.com) A 2005 report on religious education in secondary schools by the UK education watchdog group Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) noted that the episode was being used as a teaching tool.

The memorial is located north of the Capitol, on Constitution Avenue between New Jersey Avenue and First Street, N.W. Designed by architect Douglas W. Orr, the memorial consists of a Tennessee marble tower and a bronze statue of Senator Taft sculpted by Wheeler Williams. The shaft of the tower measures high, deep, and wide. Above the statue is inscribed, \\"This Memorial to Robert A. Taft, presented by the people to the Congress of the United States, stands as a tribute to the honesty, indomitable courage, and high principles of free government symbolized by his life.\\" The base of the memorial measures 55 by and stands approximately high. Jets of water flow into a basin that rings the base. The twenty-seven bells in the upper part of the tower were cast in the Paccard Foundry in Annecy-le-Vieux, France. The largest, or bourdon bell, weighs 7 tons (6350 kg). At the dedication ceremony on April 14, 1959, former President Herbert Hoover stated, \\"When these great bells ring out, it will be a summons to integrity and courage.\\" The large central bell strikes on the hour, while the smaller fixed bells chime on the quarter-hour. By resolution of Congress, they play \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" at 2 p.m. on the Fourth of July. Construction of the memorial was authorized by 69 Stat B23: Robert A.

History WPKV's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD. =As WESA-FM= WPKV was originally Adult Top 40 WESA-FM, the sister station of WESA, and was licensed to Charleroi, Pennsylvania; first going on the air in 1967 and under the ownership of Laubach Radio Properties. Created out of necessity to serve the Mon-Yough area because its AM sister was only licensed to operate during sunrise to sunset hours, WESA-FM offered some separate programming during the day, but at night, picked up where WESA was forced to leave off. Both stations became a full-time simulcast once new FCC regulations were passed eliminating the rule mandating that combination AM/FM license holders originate separate programming for half of the broadcast day. =As WZKT \\"Z98\\"= In 1998 WESA-FM abandoned its call letters and adult contemporary full-service format, and flipped to Top 40 as WZKT (Z98), but that format would go away in January 2000 after it was sold to Keymarket Communications. Keymarket, which had owned and operated \\"Froggy\\" branded country music stations throughout Pennsylvania already for ten years, had been looking to gain a foothold in the Pittsburgh market. The opportunity presented itself for Keymarket to acquire WESA and WZKT, and both stations were sold for $1.3 million. Keymarket, in March 2002, petitioned the FCC for permission to change the station's city of license to Duquesne, allowing them to realize the intended goal of targeting Pittsburgh proper. By the end of the decade, Keymarket had acquired other signals surrounding Pittsburgh enough to target the city from a multitude of different frequencies, and could focus the station on possibly another format. =WPKV today= On August 28, 2009 Keymarket announced that it sold WOGI to Educational Media Foundation, which announced plans to bring the K-LOVE Christian Contemporary music format to Pittsburgh as early as September 1, 2009.

History On July 16, 1957, the first shovel of earth was thrown, marking the beginning of the Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS), which was commissioned July 19, 1961. Captain W.F. Krantz, USN received the golden key to the air station, and senior Mississippi U.S. Senator John C. Stennis was the guest speaker for the ceremony that opened the $60 million base. At that time, the operations area was named McCain Field in honor of the late Admiral John S. McCain, Sr. of Teoc, Mississippi.http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=91679 Training Squadron SEVEN (VT-7) arrived at NAAS Meridian July 12, 1961, then split to form its sister squadron, Training Squadron NINE (VT-9) on December 15. In September 1965, hundreds of planes from Florida bases arrived to escape the wrath of Hurricane Betsy. The Naval Auxiliary Air Station continued to grow, and by July 1968, the station became a full Naval Air Station. The years brought an increase in building development and family housing units. In 1968, and again in 1969, 300 aircraft from Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida arrived to escape the fury and destruction of Hurricane Gladys and Hurricane Camille, respectively. In August 1971, Training Air Wing ONE (TRAWING ONE) was commissioned and Training Squadron NINETEEN (VT-19) was also established. The Wing motto became \\"Readiness for Victory at Sea through Training.\\" That October saw the arrival of the TA-4J, the new advanced jet trainer based on the A-4 \\"Skyhawk.\\" In April 1973, President Richard M. Nixon, accompanied by Senator John C. Stennis and many other high-ranking military and civilian officials, attended the dedication of the new Naval Technical Training Center (NTTC). Known locally as the Stennis Center, it was officially commissioned April 17, 1974. Aerial view of NAS Meridian in the early 1960s NAS Meridian was selected and upgraded to a Major Shore Command on October 1, 1982. In March 1984, NAS Meridian was one of 15 installations chosen for the Department of Defense Model Installation Program. In September 1985, the enlisted galley was dedicated to the memory of Marine Lance Corporal Roy M. Wheat, a Mississippi native and Medal of Honor recipient who was killed in Vietnam.http://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrse/installations/nas_meridian/about/history.html Current operations NAS Meridian supports aviation and technical training, and other tenant activities by providing timely, quality services and facilities in an environmentally safe, secure community. Departments working under the NAS Commanding Officer form the backbone for the entire installation's functioning. The Administrative Services Department provides general administrative services for the command. Responsibilities include: processing military personnel matters with the Personnel Support Activity Detachment, Meridian; processing special requests, leave and TAD orders, evaluations and command correspondence; maintaining command directives and correspondence files; providing duplicating services and messenger systems; and coordinating administrative systems and services throughout the command.http://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrse/installations/nas_meridian.html The Air Operations Department employs 230 military and civilian personnel to operate NAS Meridian/McCain Field and Naval Outlying Landing Field (NOLF) Joe Williams. Their primary mission is to support Commander, Training Air Wing ONE, the wing's subordinate training squadrons and its associated T-45 Goshawk aircraft in the conduct of undergraduate strike pilot training. Additional services are furnished to support operations for NAS and transient military aircrews. Air Traffic Control Division operates the control tower and radar final control systems. They provide flight planning services and issue clearances and instructions to pilots for all phases of military flight operations within the vicinity of the airport. Ground Electronics Maintenance Division (GEMD) ensures all assigned UHF, VHF and FM radio communications, air navigation aids, weather monitoring/reporting equipment and precision approach radars required to conduct safe and effective flight operations around NAS Meridian and its outlying field operate at or above designated performance standards. GEMD also provides sound support services and functions as point of contact for matters related to 3M, frequency management, equipment configuration and computer repair/assistance. NAS Meridian maintains a separate runway, Joe Williams Outlying Landing Field (OLF), approximately 25 miles northwest of the main air station. Joe Williams OLF is an 8,000 foot long runway located in a rural area between the communities of Bogue Chitto and De Kalb. The field is used to reduced traffic congestion at the main air station, primarily when students are conducting Field Carrier Landing Practice in preparation for initial aircraft carrier qualification.http://www.mybaseguide.com/navy/82-1957/nas_meridian_tenantshttp://www.airnav.com/airport/KNJW HH-1N Huey helicopters were formerly used by the station's Search and Rescue personnel to provide 24-hour rescue coverage of the Eastern Mississippi/Western Alabama area.

They are scattered over all the 35 districts of Maharashtra. The Dhangars consist of 22 endogamous groups. The Dange Dhangars found in the coastal strip are pastoral people and practise shifting cultivation, the Hatkar and a few others are Shepherds, the Sangars are weavers of woollen blankets, the Khatik Dhangars sell meat, but do not rear sheep, and the Khutekars rear sheep and weave. In the past, some Dhangars were Inamdars and some were tenure-holders, holding lands either by a share or by paying a lump sum for a certain period. Depiction of a Dhangar tribal in the past. Gavli are a sub-caste of Dhangar. They are found in forested hill tracts of India's Western Ghats. Dhangars in Goa are referred to as Gouly or Gavli. Yadavas of Devagiri or Seuna Yadavas are called \\"Gavli Kings\\". Like Hoysala Yadavas, Seunas Yadavas were also originally pastoralists or cattle- herders. The Yadavas often proudly claimed their pastoral ancestry. According to M. S. A. Rao, present-day Yadav comprise of different allied castes of several denominations such as Ahirs in Punjab, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat, Thetwars and Raots in Madhya Pradesh, Gawlis or Gopals in Maharashtra, Idaiyan in Tamil Nadu, Golla in Andhra Pradesh and Mysore, Gopas in Bengal. Among other denominations are Gwal, Dhanpal, Dhangar, Nanda and Dhinderd. However, Gawli caste of Maharashtra is distinct from Dhangar. Gawlis tend cows and other milch cattle. According to Shyam Singh Shashi, Marathas of Indore (Holkar) call themselves Dhangar Ahir and Ahirs of Maharashtra prefer to be known as Ahir Dhangars - Ahir is one of the gotra of Dhangars. In North India the Ahirs, who call themselves Yadav, were at one time a wing of Dhangar society - which includes Gadaria in North India and Kuruba both in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. He further states that 80 percent of gotras of Dhangars are similar to kshatriyas though 15 percent resembles those of Brahmins, Vaishyas and backward classes. Etymology The word \\"Dhangar\\" may be associated with a term for \\"cattle wealth\\" or be derived from the hills in which they lived (Sanskrit \\"dhang\\"). Ul Hassan noted that some people of his time believed the term to come from the Sanskrit \\"dhenugar\\" (\\"cattle herder\\") but dismissed that etymology as being \\"fictitious\\". History The archaeological evidence and ethnographic data suggest that the contemporary Dhangar castes are the result of more than one migration from North-West India, between 4000 and 10000 BC. The density and distribution patterns of the different groups of Dhangars seem to have been guided by the suitability of the region for the sustenance of the animals that they traditionally maintained and the products of those animals on which the specific groups subsisted. Ethno-historic investigations among the Dhangars suggest that, out of 22 endogamous groups, the Kannade, Unnikankan and Kurmar who speak Kannada were originally from Karnataka and might have migrated to the present habitats in Maharashtra at different points of time. Whereas Hatkar, Zende, Thellari and Dange trace their origin to a single caste in the remote past, Shegars claim that they have nothing to do with the Dhangars and are descendents from Rajputs of Rajasthan. Ahirs who speak \\"Ahrani\\" a mixed dialect of Gujarati and Marathi and are closely related to the Ladshe and Dange who have supposedly come from Gujarat. On the other hand, Gadhari-Nikhar and Gadhari-Dhangar, having migrated from North India, speak Hindi. Telangi speaks Telugu and probably migrated from Andhra Pradesh, the remaining groups speak Marathi. The Khatiks are said to have derived from Khutekars. Reginald Edward Enthoven classifies Dhangars into 23 sub-castes. Out of which Asal Dhangars or Maratha Dhangars who form an important element in the Dhangar population are the representatives of the original Dhangars who settled in the Marathi speaking districts. Another large sub-caste Hatkar is of considerable importance in Berar. They claim to be Bargi Dhangar or \\"shepherds with the spears\\". They also claim to be Marathas and were perhaps Bargirs or mounted troopers during the time of the Maratha Empire. Enthoven further states that Dhangars were noted for their martial qualities. Shivaji's most trusted Mawalas or Maratha footmen were West-Pune Dhangars, and many of the bravest Maratha leaders, among whom the Holkars are the most distinguished. In 1798, Colonel Tone, who commanded a regiment of the Peshwa's army, wrote of the Marathas: \\"The three great tribes which compose the Maratha caste are the Kunbi or farmer, The Dhangar or shepherd, and the Gwala or cowherd; to this original cause may perhaps be ascribed that great simplicity of manner which distinguishes the Maratha people\\". Varna status Dhangars regard themselves as belonging to the Kshatriya varna and to support this they give the example of the role played by the Holkar dynasty in Maratha history. This is also reflected in their social relations and day-to-day behavior with Schedule Castes. Thus, as far as the various sub-castes of the Dhangars in Maharashtra are concerned, they themselves claim to belong to a Hindu Caste cluster just below the hierarchical status of the Maratha Kunbi - peasants or farmers. Dhangars employ Brahmins for religious and ceremonial purposes, and these Brahmins are received on terms of equality by other Brahmins. When Brahmins are not easily available, the elders of the caste perform the ceremonies. The marriage ceremonies of Dhangars do not differ much from those of Kunbis. According to Gail Omvedt and Bharat Patankar, The group considering themselves \\"highest\\" in the Other Backward Class category are mainly the peasant castes (Jats and Kurmis in north India, Kunbis in Maharashtra, Vellalar in south India, etc), close to these are the herding (Yadav, Dhangars, Kuruba) and gardening (Mali, Sainis) communities. Ranging below these are the various artisan and service groups ‚Äì goldsmiths, blacksmiths, potters, barbers, washermen etc. Ambedkar had described caste as a \\"graded hierarchy\\" with an ascending ladder of status and a descending degree of contempt. Phule had talked of how the \\"ignorant Kunbi looked down on the ignorant Mahar, the ignorant Mahar scorned the ignorant Mang\\" ‚Äì these were expressions of this hierarchy of caste, in which every group tried to claim a higher status than another. Current situation Traditionally being shepherds, cowherds, buffalo keepers, blanket and wool weavers, butchers and farmers, the Dhangars were late to take up modern-day education. In Maharashtra, the Dhangars are classified as a Nomadic Tribe but in 2014 were seeking to be reclassified as a Scheduled Tribe in India's system of reservation. The Dhangar community's population in Maharashtra is around one crore (ten million), which is 9% of the total 11.25 crore (112.5 million) population of the state. Devendra Fadnavis, former Chief Minister of Maharashtra, had said that \\"The situation of the Dhangars in some areas of the state was worse than that of Scheduled Tribes, and the government was committed to providing them reservation under the ST category\\". In Goa, they are classified as Other Backward Classes category in India's system of reservation. Dhangad vs Dhangar issue in Uttar Pradesh According to the 2011 Census of India, Dhangad or Oraon or Dhanka people are listed as Scheduled Tribes in the states of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. However, In Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal Dhangad or Dom is listed as Scheduled Caste whereas Oraon as Scheduled Tribe. In Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand Dhangar is classified as Scheduled Caste. On 17th January 2019, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Research and Training Institute (SCSTRTI) wrote a letter to the Principal Secretary to the Government of Uttar Pradesh stating that the Hindi version of the word Dhangar is Dhangad as per the Gazette notification issued in 1950 by the President/Indian Government. They recommended that the Gaderia community's Dhangar should not be included in the Scheduled Caste category. Dhangar is a sub-caste of the Gadaria caste in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the Kuruba caste in Karnataka and the Bharwad caste in Gujarat. Gadaria or Gaderia, Kuruba and Bharwad are classified as Other Backward Class in those respective states, including Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, in India's system of reservation. Culture Khandoba (literally \\"father swordsman\\"), the guardian deity of the Deccan is the favorite god of the caste and is worshipped every Sunday and on Saturday (the light sixth of Margashirsha) day, with offerings of sweetmeats. Vithoba of Pandharpur is worshipped daily in every household. Subdivisions Initially there were twelve tribes of Dhangar, and they had a division of labour amongst brothers of one family. This later formed three sub-divisions and one half-division. These three being Hatkar (shepherds), Ahir (cowherds) and Khutekar (wool and blanket weavers)/Sangar. The half-division is called Khatik. All sub-castes fall in either of these divisions. All sub-divisions emerge from one stock, and all sub-divisions claim to be a single group of Dhangars. The number three and a half is not a random selection but has a religious and cosmological significance.G.D. Sontheimer, The Dhangars: a community in a developing agricultural environment; G.D. Sontheimer and L.S. Leshnik, eds., Pastoralists and Nomads in South Asia, Wiesbaden, 1975, p. 140. All Dhangars of Western Maharashtra and Konkan/Desh regions (formerly Marhatta country), like Holkars who were Dhangar, can be termed \\"Marathas\\", but not all Marathas are Dhangars.

The daughter of Jacques Billet, a jeweller for the Crown of Poland, she had a lavish education and learnt Latin to a proficient enough level that she was able to translate the works of Horace and Virgil. A M. Laya would later introduce her to French poetry, which would capture her imagination for years to come. At the age of fifteen, she married a rich prosecutor, Simon Petit-Dufrenoy, at the Ch√¢telet de Paris. Her marital home became the meeting-place of the beaux-esprits of the city, which influenced her towards a true poetic vocation. In 1787, her career as a writer started in earnest with a small work titled Boutade, to a friend. Also, she had a few of her poems published in the popular poetic periodical, the Almanach des Muses. The subsequent year, she tried her hand with theatre, and put on a play, l'Amour exil√© des Cieux (\\"Love Exiled from the Skies\\"), but she would owe her literary reputation to her popular elegies. Her run of good luck ended when the French Revolution erupted and their home was set on fire, which would lead to the bankruptcy of her husband. The Directoire offered no compensation to them, and the subsequent Consulate moved him to a badly paid job in Alexandria. Ad√©la√Øde-Gillette accompanied him there and, when he went blind, tried to help him by copying his dossiers and writing out his judgements. Despite this monopolising her time, it is from this sombre period that the majority of her elegies come. The melancholy that she felt was bolstered by her feeling so far from her homeland. Upon her husband's retiring, she returned to an uncomfortable life back in France, until, thanks to the intervention of Antoine Vincent Arnault and the Comte de S√©gur, she was freed of poverty and the need for the vital necessities of life supplied by Napol√©on, for whom she vowed her utmost support. Leaving trade for art, her literary career took an upturn. She started to write erotic poetry, veiled in elegy. In 1807, the first edition of her Elegies was published and was a great success, and in 1812, she sang for the King of Rome. A year later, she was part of the escort that accompanied Marie Louise of Austria to Cherbourg. Things were looking up for Ad√©la√Øde and her husband, but once again, the tempestuous political climate of contemporary France disturbed her plans. This time, it would be the fall of the French Empire that affected her and her fellow nationals, but this time, she would manage to do well, her gift for writing becoming her family's saving grace. She wrote many children's books; edited la Minerve litt√©raire, l'Almanach des Dames, and l'Hommage aux Demoiselles; translated some novels from English and wrote novels of her own. She saw much of her work lauded by critics of the day and various academies; most prominently, she was awarded a prize by the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise for her poem, Les Derniers Moments de Bayard (\\"The last moments of Bayard.\\"). She died in Paris on the 7 March 1825, survived by her son, the geologist and mineralogist, Armand Dufr√©noy.

History WPXC's logo from 2003 until 2012 In February 2005, Ernie Boch, Sr. sold WPXC, WTWV, WDVT, WCOD, and WXTK to Qantum Communications. Due to the FCC's rules on ownership caps, Qantum had to put WTWV, WDVT, and WPXC up for a pending sale. In March 2005, Nassau Broadcasting Partners bought the three stations from Qantum Communications. WPXC's sister stations WTWV and WDVT became WFRQ and WFQR. Over the past seven years, WPXC has played more Classic Rock music than Active Rock while being owned by Nassau. On May 4, 2012, Nassau Broadcasting and its lenders auctioned off all of their Cape stations to John Garabedian.

Owned by iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel Communications), the station broadcasts at 105.9 MHz with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 15.5 kW. Since October 2006, WXDX has been the radio flagship station of the National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins. Its transmitter is located in Pittsburgh's North Side, while its studios are located in Green Tree. History WXDX's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD. 105.9 FM signed on as WAMO-FM in 1948 and had the most powerful signal coverage in western Pennsylvania. It also had various formats during its early years, which also included Album-oriented Rock, Disco, and CHUrban. However, it had better success with its urban contemporary/R&B; direction, of which the WAMO call letters would be associated with in the following decades, even with various frequency changes. In 1974, WAMO and WAMO-FM began separate programming. The A.M. station aired Urban Gospel programming on weekdays, while on weekends, it simulcasted WAMO-FM. WAMO-FM was formatted as an Urban Contemporary station with Gospel programming on Sunday. Over the years, the station was branded as \\"Hot 106 WAMO\\". On April 10, 1996, at 3 PM, WAMO swapped frequencies with WXDX, and moved to the 106.7 frequency, with WXDX moving to 105.9 FM. WXDX was one of six stations in the Clear Channel roster that dropped Howard Stern in February 2004 (however, Stern would show up on WRKZ later that year). Howard began airing on WXDX in November 1995 (when it was still on 106.7 FM). Currently, the station‚Äôs air staff consists of morning host Abby Krizner, midday & weekend host Russ ‚ÄúWhip‚Äù Rose, afternoon host Mark Madden, evening host Stacy Walter, and weekend/swing hosts Brandy Richey, Katie Oltmanns, and Travis Marzina. Additional time is filled by programming from the Penguins Radio Network and iHeartMedia‚Äôs Premium Choice network, which provides the station with talent and music in the overnight hours and Saturday evenings. =Former on-air staff= * Alan Cox ‚Äì The Alan Cox Radio Show. Alan Cox generated a sizable following after being hired to host afternoons in 1999. He replaced \\"The Howard Stern Show\\" in the morning in June 2004 and his contract was not renewed for financial reasons in 2006. Cox released three CDs while on the air at WXDX-FM Pittsburgh: \\"Alan Cox Sells Out\\", \\"Ribbed\\", and \\"Shadyside Bathroom Wall Blues\\". He frequently performed at numerous comedy clubs throughout the area, and a portion of the proceeds from his CDs were donated to local charities. Cox left in 2006 to host The Morning Fix at WKQX (Q101) in Chicago. Currently, he hosts afternoons at WMMS in Cleveland, Ohio. * Tim Benz ‚Äì Co-hosted the weekday morning show from 2006 until February 2014, when he became sports director for all Pittsburgh Clear Channel stations.

WXDX- FM HD2 WXDX broadcasts on its HD2 subchannel dates back to 2006, when the subchannel launched a format focusing on Adult Album Alternative (Triple A) music. In May 2009, as part of WXDX's renewal of Pittsburgh Penguins radio rights, WXDX and the Penguins announced that the HD2 subchannel would become a 24-hour channel devoted to Penguins coverage, billed as \\"Pittsburgh Penguins Radio.\\" Plans for the channel (which launched October 1, 2009) include local and nationally-originated Penguins and hockey coverage (including \\"NHL Live\\" and league commissioner Gary Bettman‚Äôs weekly ‚ÄúNHL Hour\\"), rebroadcasts of classic Penguins games, and game broadcasts of the team's top farm club in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. The move will make the Penguins the second North American professional sports team (the first NHL team) with their own terrestrial radio channel (after the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and their HD2 relationship with KRLD-FM). In the fall of 2015, WXDX-HD2 dropped Penguins Radio 24/7 with music WXDX normally plays on their station (but still simulcast Penguins games) until late March 2016 when they replaced the format altogether with iHeart2000s (which was moved over by WKST-HD2, and was replaced with Pride Radio). As of early 2020, WXDX is no longer broadcasting an HD2 subchannel.

It lives at high altitudes‚Äî‚Äîin the Rocky Mountains of Idaho, Montana, British Columbia, and Alberta. There is a disjunct population in the Cascade Range of Washington. Subalpine larch is hardy and can survive at low temperatures and on thin rocky soils; the tree is often found near treeline. However, it can grow in a variety of soils and with or without shade, as long as the soil is moist but well-drained. Description Fall foliage and cone Larix lyallii is a small tree, growing from tall and shorter at higher elevations. It has a straight trunk with a sparse and somewhat conical crown. The branches are horizontal to the trunk, irregularly spaced and twisted. The twigs are finely hairy. The needles are four-angled, long and crowded in groups of 30 to 40 on short spurs. They are pale blue-green and deciduous, turning golden yellow in autumn. The seed cones, long, are red-purple when young but become dark brown with age. They have thin scales and narrow bracts that extend over the scales. The bark is thin and turns from yellow-gray to dark red-brown with age. It also becomes deeply furrowed into small, scaly plates. The tree is also one of the longest lived tree species. There is record of a specimen in Kananaskis, Alberta which has been estimated (extrapolated) to be ~2000 years old, the oldest tree in Canada. Uses The bark contains tannin and the wood is strong, heavy, and durable.

It is an international projectAs of January 2008, 26 contributors have provided more than 1,000 indexes, see the full list: The Inducks Disney Comics database: Indexers. which provides indexes of around 130,000 Disney comic publications worldwide.As of July 30, 2011, see the statistics at Inducks. It is distributed with its own licence.H. Fluks, F. Stajano, Inducks Licence Version 4B (a kind of permissive, \\"copyleft\\" \\"free\\" licence). Origin Efforts to catalog Disney comic stories on a large scale date from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Among the most important works are an index of Disney comics published in Denmark,. a list of stories produced in Italy,. a list of American daily strips and Sunday pages,. an index of American Dell Disney comics and a Carl Barks index. (published earlier in a shorter form in the fanzine Funnyworld in the 1970s). All these lists include artists and writer credits that were previously unknown. In August 1992, Per Starb√§ck (from Sweden) created the Disney Comics Mailing List.Commonly called the DCML. Members soon contributed lists of Disney comics and gave references for printed indexes. In May 1994, expanding on information exchanged on the mailing list, Harry Fluks (from the Netherlands) created a database to organize comic indexes, and called it the Disney Comics Database.Interviews of H. Fluks in the fanzines Ankkalinnan Pamaus 2000-02 (online English version ), in DDF(R)appet 5, 2004 and on the Web site of the Danish Donaldist Society , 2005. In 1999, a German member suggested the name Inducks as a cross between \\"index\\" and \\"duck\\" (for Donald Duck). It was playfully written I.N.D.U.C.K.S. to resemble acronyms seen in Junior Woodchucks comics.The word Inducks is a combination of Index and Ducks. Brix Lichtenberg came up with this name as a replacement for the (more boring) name Disney comics Database. He intended it to be an abbreviation (I.N.D.U.C.K.S.) like the ranks in the Junior Woodchuck stories, but we haven't figured out yet what it is supposed to mean ... in Ankkalinnan Pamaus 2000-02 . Several meanings have been proposed, including \\"Internet Database for Uncle Walt's Comics and Stories\\", \\"International Network for Disney Universal Comic Knowledge and Sources\\",From the Bolderbast , an Inducks website. up to 2008 when International Network of Disney-Universe Comic Knowers and Sources was selected. Over the years, a Web search interface was introduced, later replaced by a second search engine, COA,A precise time- frame is as follows (from messages in the Disney comics mailing list): Disney comics indexes were exchanged as early as 1992, e.g., September 11; the first mention of the Disney comics database (DcD) is from April 18, 1994; its first public release is on May 25, 1994; the first mention of a web search program is from March 22, 1995; the first mention of Inducks is from February 9, 1999; the first mention of the COA search engine on the Disney comics mailing list is from April 9, 2001 (see archived copy here). in 2001. Data details The Inducks database lists publications, stories, characters and creators which are cross-referenced. Each story is given a unique \\"storycode\\"Details at Inducks . so that reprints (often from all over the world) may be found for any story. A large number of Disney comics publications are indexed for the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and United States. Among countries with a significant Disney comics tradition, indexes for Mexico, United Kingdom and (ex-)Yugoslavia are still very incomplete.As of January 2008 - figures from Inducks. Inducks integrates previous studies and research works, with permission of the authors,M. Barlotti, Da Fossati al'Inducks: il progetto I.N.D.U.C.K.S., Notiziario della Anonima Fumetti, 1999 ; a complete list is given at Inducks . as well as its own research. Thanks to contacts with creators,The Brazilian \\"branch\\" of Inducks lists about 30 authors who provide information ; see also the biographical notice of comic writer Leonardo Gori or the \\"book work\\" of archivist and editor David Gerstein. it provides credits to anonymous (or wrongly-credited) stories. In particular, most Disney comics were not given credits until the 1980s or 1990s.

The title has become a nickname for Australia\\"Australia second best place to live: UN\\", 774 ABC Melbourne, 3 November 2011 and is generally used favourably, although the origin of the phrase was negative in the context of the book. Among other things, it has been used in reference to Australia's natural resources, weather, history, its early dependency of the British system, distance from problems elsewhere in the world, and other sorts of supposed prosperity. Horne's intent in writing the book was to portray Australia's climb to power and wealth based almost entirely on luck rather than the strength of its political or economic system, which Horne believed was \\"second rate\\". In addition to political and economic weaknesses, he also lamented on the lack of innovation and ambition, as well as a philistinism in the absence of art, among the Australian population, viewed by Horne as being complacent and indifferent to intellectual matters. He also commented on matters relating to Australian puritanism, as well as conservatism, particularly in relation to censorship and politics. Overview The title of Horne's book comes from the opening words of the book's last chapter: > Australia is a lucky country run mainly by second rate people who share its > luck. It lives on other people's ideas, and, although its ordinary people > are adaptable, most of its leaders (in all fields) so lack curiosity about > the events that surround them that they are often taken by surprise.The > Lucky Country ‚Äì Introduction to the sixth edition by Hugh Mackay (extract), > Penguin Modern Classics Horne's statement was an indictment of 1960s Australia. His intent was to comment that, while other industrialized nations created wealth using clever means such as technology and other innovations, Australia did not. Rather, Australia's economic prosperity was largely derived from its rich natural resources and immigration. Horne observed that Australia \\"showed less enterprise than almost any other prosperous industrial society.\\" In his 1976 follow-up book, Death of the Lucky Country, Horne clarified what he had meant when he first coined the term: > When I invented the phrase in 1964 to describe Australia, I said: 'Australia > is a lucky country run by second rate people who share its luck.' I didn't > mean that it had a lot of material resources ‚Ä¶ I had in mind the idea of > Australia as a [British] derived society whose prosperity in the great age > of manufacturing came from the luck of its historical origins ‚Ä¶ In the lucky > style we have never 'earned' our democracy. We simply went along with some > British habits. In the decades following his book's publication, Horne became critical of the \\"lucky country\\" phrase being used as a term of endearment for Australia. He commented, \\"I have had to sit through the most appalling rubbish as successive generations misapplied this phrase.\\" Legacy The book became a phenomenon at its publication, despite some initially critical reviews. One commentator remarked that the release of the book was like \\"A bucket of cold saltwater emptied onto the belly of a dreaming sunbather\\". It was published at a time when criticism of Australia, which had experienced an ascension to wealth and prosperity in a relatively short history (the country was federated in 1901), was rife. It is not the only book to shine an unfavourable light on the country: Robin Boyd's The Australian Ugliness was released four years earlier in 1960 and is considered a seminal work on Australian architecture. Boyd's book was an indictment on the taste of Australian suburbanites, and the aesthetic of the Australian suburbs, which he lamented was in a deplorable state, full of European imitation styles fused together to make one whole. Horne's book was given an unofficial sequel in 2016, with Ian Lowe's The Lucky Country? Reinventing Australia. Lowe's book addresses Horne's stance, and states that due to poor leadership, little has changed since The Lucky Country. With regard to economic innovation, Australia still ranks low: in 2014 The Economist's Economic Innovation Index ranked Australia 22nd, behind Japan, the US, Germany and Sweden.

It is one of the oldest and most influential NGOs nationwide in China. CWI was originally named the China defense League (CDL). In December 1941, CDL was moved to Chongqing, and it fully rallied support for the War of Chinese People against Japanese Aggression. In November 1945, it was renamed the China Welfare Found (CWF) with its headquarters moved to Shanghai to support the great cause of liberation of the Chinese people. Meanwhile, it was active in promoting children welfare through cultural and educational programs. In August 1950, the name was changed to the China Welfare Institute (CWI), with its guidelines set to run experimental and demonstrative projects in women and children's health care and children's culture, education and welfare, enhance scientific researches, and continue international exchanges and cooperation. Soong Ching Ling personally initiated many cultural, educational and healthcare institutions for women and children, including the CWI Children's Art Theatre, the CWI International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, the CWI Children's Palace, the CWI Nursery, the CWI Kindergarten, the CWI Children's Epoch Publishing House, and the Children's Art Playhouse. This has made her a paragon of commitment to the welfare of children in China after 1949. In the past 80 years, CWI has received great support and encouragement from many CPC and national government leaders, including Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping. CWI was successively chaired by Soong Ching Ling, Liao Chengzhi, Kang Keqing, Huang Hua, and Hu Qili, followed by Wang Jiarui who has taken over the office since 2017. All CWI chairmen or chairwomen are the Party and State Leaders of China. Its executive board consists of members from departments of the CPC Central Committee, ministries under the State Council, departments of the CPC Shanghai Committee and the municipal government, as well as other NGOs. Currently, CWI runs many institutions specialized in areas of 1) maternal and child health, 2) school education, 3) out-of- school education, 3) children's play, 4) children's book publication, 5) senior citizen welfare, and 6) social welfare fund. Committed to the mandate of \\"being experimental and demonstrative\\" proposed by Soong Ching Ling and Premier Zhou Enlai, CWI has carried forward Soong's initiative to be fully dedicated to the welfare of women and children. Based in Shanghai with a vow of serving the whole nation and the world, it has made outstanding achievements in the process of institute development and has been widely recognized by the society. CWI has now become important organization working for the welfare of women and children.

It is among the world's most powerful single-engined diesel locomotives. History The AC6000CW was designed at the height of a horsepower race between the two major locomotive manufacturers, Electro-Motive Division of La Grange, Illinois, and GE Transportation of Erie, Pennsylvania, in the early to mid 1990s. The goal was . GE worked with Deutz-MWM of Germany in 1994 to design and construct the 7HDL engine for the locomotives. The first locomotive constructed was the \\"Green Machine\\" GE 6000, nicknamed for its green paint scheme. The first production models were also built in 1995: CSX Transportation 600-602, and Union Pacific Railroad 7000-7009. After testing was completed by GE, they were released to their respective owners in late 1996. Union Pacific Railroad 7391, an example of the 106 \\"Convertibles\\" built for Union Pacific Railroad with the 7FDL engine The initial locomotives suffered from various mechanical problems with the most severe being the engine itself. There were major vibration problems which were addressed by increasing the engine mass to lower the resonant frequency. This in turn caused problems with the twin turbochargers. These problems caused GE to push back full production of the new model until 1998. Changes such as stiffer materials and increased engine wall thickness (to increase mass) were in place at full production. GE built 106 AC6000CWs for Union Pacific with the older, proven 7FDL engine, rated for . These units were originally supposed to be converted to the 7HDL engine after the problems were worked out with the engine, but this never occurred. GE considers these units as AC6000CW \\"Convertibles,\\" while UP classifies them as C6044ACs or AC4460CWs. The AC6000CW ended production in 2001, although Union Pacific's 75xx series remains in daily use as of 2010, mostly on rock and gravel trains in Texas. Union Pacific designates these units as C60AC, CSX as CW60AC and CW60AH. CSX Transportation has re-powered many of their AC6000CW units from 16-7HDL engines to GEVO-16 to make them more reliable and environmentally friendly. These units are capable of but are rated at and classified as CW46AH.

Owned by iHeartMedia, the station covers the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The WWSW studios are located in the Pittsburgh suburb of Green Tree, while the station transmitter resides in Pittsburgh's Perry South neighborhood. Besides a standard analog transmission, WWSW broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio. WWSW is notable for being an FM \\"superpower station\\", with an effective radiated power exceeding Federal Communications Commission (FCC) restrictions for Class B FM signals. History On August 13, 1940, Walker & Downing Radio Corporation applied to the FCC for a construction permit to build a new FM station. It would broadcast on 43.5 MHz in the original FM broadcast band, which was located between 42 and 50 MHz. The FCC granted the permit on December 12, 1940, while reallocating the station to 44.7 MHz and assigning the station the W47P call sign. The station was granted its first license by the FCC on May 20, 1942. On September 23, 1942, the FCC modified the station's license when Walker & Downing Radio Corporation changed its name to WWSW, Inc., named after co-owned WWSW (970 AM). On November 1, 1943, the station was assigned the WTNT call sign, followed by another call sign change effective October 3, 1945 to WMOT. The FCC created the current FM broadcast band on June 27, 1945. The commission granted WWSW, Inc. the authority to cease operations effective December 12, 1945, so the station could be converted to a new frequency on the new band. On July 25, 1946, the FCC reallocated the station to 94.5 MHz, and granted WWSW, Inc. a construction permit for operation on the new frequency effective November 13, 1947. On February 24, 1949, the call sign was changed to WWSW-FM. Following a series of modifications to the construction permit from 1947 to 1954, the FCC granted the station a new license with the new facilities on January 11, 1954. The station's license was voluntarily reassigned to WWSW Radio, Inc. effective August 1, 1955. On December 21, 1957, the FCC granted the new owner a construction permit to increase the station's effective radiated power (ERP) to 50,000 watts while increasing the antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) to 940 feet. A new license with the upgraded facilities was granted by the FCC on September 25, 1958. Due to subsequent regulations adopted by the FCC that significantly limit the height placement for Class B FM stations corresponding to their ERP, WWSW-FM is recognized as a grandfathered ‚Äúsuperpower‚Äù station. WWSW Radio, Inc. was granted a construction permit by the FCC on August 6, 1967 to install a new transmitter and antenna. The permit lowered the station's HAAT to 810 feet. The FCC granted a new license with the new facilities on August 1, 1969. In the late 1960s, WWSW-FM switched to an automated Top 40 format while WWSW remained a Top 40 station with live disc jockeys.Broadcasting Yearbook 1972 page B-182 On November 18, 1973, the station's call sign was changed to WPEZ, carving out its own identity apart from WWSW. WPEZ was a successful Top 40 station for the next seven years. On Labor Day, 1980, the station gave up top 40 for an adult contemporary format. The station's call sign was changed back to WWSW-FM on September 28, 1980. For most of the 1980s, WWSW-FM began to add more oldies titles into its playlist, to distinguish it from other Pittsburgh AC stations. The AM and FM stations both flipped to all-oldies in February 1988, simulcasting for part of the time. When not simulcasting, the FM played a core blend of oldies hits from the 1960s and early 1970s, while the AM leaned more towards 1950s and early 1960s titles. In 1991, the AM's independent programming was abandoned and began simulcasting the FM 100%. The AM split from the FM in August 2000 and adopted a sports radio format as WBGG. In 2006, it was announced that Pitt Panthers football and basketball games would be aired on WWSW-FM. This lasted until 2012, when the team's games switched to KDKA-FM. Like many FM oldies stations in the early 2000s, WWSW-FM had been de-emphasizing music of the 1950s and 1960s in favor of more songs from the 1970s and a few early 1980s titles. It also stopped using the word \\"oldies\\" on the air. In 2006, the music was abruptly adjusted forward with more emphasis on the 1970s and even more from the 1980s. The station started to play artists it had ignored before, including Styx, Huey Lewis & the News, Prince and Bruce Springsteen, while dropping long-time staples of an earlier vintage like the Dave Clark Five, Little Richard, Gary Lewis and the Playboys and Herman's Hermits. However, The Beatles and Motown continued to be a staple of the station's playlist. By the 2010s, the only 1960s tracks that remain on the station's playlist were those that had a high level of popularity over the years, including songs by The Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, The Supremes, and The Rolling Stones. In addition, the station began to incorporate some tracks from the early 1990s into the playlist, including hits from Bryan Adams, R.E.M., Prince and Sheryl Crow. The station's playlist began focusing on the mid-1970s all the way up through 1989, with a few late 1960s, early 1970s, and early 1990s tracks also getting airtime. WWSW's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD. Beginning each year in early to mid-November, WWSW switches to all Christmas music, including both classic Christmas standards and some recent material. During the holidays, WWSW suspends some features such as the \\"All Request Cafe,\\" \\"The Ultimate Radio Party\\" and replays of 1970s/1980s versions of American Top 40. Currently, WWSW has only four live, local airstaff - Jonny Hartwell (weekdays, 5-10AM), Sheri Van Dyke (weekdays, 10AM-3PM), and Mike Frazer (weekdays, 3-9PM). Bonnie Diver, morning traffic director for iHeartMedia Pittsburgh and former 3WS midday host, also contributes to the morning drive show. Outside of this time, the station carries talent from iHeartMedia‚Äôs Premium Choice network (which is also utilized when Sheri and Mike are absent), which is voice-tracked from out-of-market, as well as several nationally-syndicated shows. Past air personalities on 3WS include Jim Merkel, Gary Dickson, Kenny Woods, Steve Hansen, Cris Winter, Bumper Morgan (deceased), RD Summers (deceased), Theresa Colaizzi, Ray Walker (deceased), Clarke Ingram, Lani Daniels, Mike Steele (deceased), Steve Grenato, and Kate Harris. During the prime years at 3WS, the morning show featured Merkel and Dickson. The station had oldies concerts that filled Three Rivers Stadium many times with oldies acts, and even legendary oldies DJ Wolfman Jack made an appearance on February 23, 1991. The station received 3 Marconi Awards for best oldies station in the United States, while the morning show received five AIR awards (Achievement in Radio) for best morning show in Pittsburgh. Longtime air personality Jim Merkel was released from 3WS on October 4, 2010, after more than 31 years on the staff. WWSW HD2 On April 25, 2006, Clear Channel announced that WWSW's HD2 subchannel would carry a format focusing on Rhythmic Oldies, which was originally heard on the former WJJJ (104.7 FM). In 2016, when 3WS cancelled its weekly Sunday Night Diner program, the format of the HD2 station was changed to 1950s and 60s oldies, similar to what was heard on the diner program each week. In addition, the subchannel carried Duquesne Dukes football and men's basketball games, as well as pre-game, post-game, and coaches shows for both sports.

Despite opposing the action, he took part in the Easter Rising in Dublin and was killed in a charge on a British machine gun post covering the retreat from the GPO during the fighting. Early life He was born in Ballylongford, County Kerry to Richard Rahilly, a grocer, and Ellen Rahilly (n√©e Mangan). O'Rahilly was educated in Clongowes Wood College (1890‚Äì1893). He had two siblings who lived to adulthood, Mary Ellen \\"Nell\\" Humphreys (n√©e Rahilly) and Anno O'Rahilly, both of whom were active in the Irish revolutionary period. As an adult, he became a republican and a language enthusiast. He joined the Gaelic League and became a member of An Coiste Gnotha, its governing body. He was well travelled, spending at least a decade in the United States and in Europe before settling in Dublin. He married Nancy Brown on 15 April 1899 in New York and the couple had six sons together. O'Rahilly was a founding member of the Irish Volunteers in 1913, who organized to work for Irish independence, and initially to defend the proposed Home Rule; he served as the IV Director of Arms. He personally directed the first major arming of the Irish Volunteers, the landing of 900 Mausers at the Howth gun-running on 26 July 1914. O'Rahilly was a wealthy man; the Weekly Irish Times reported after the Easter Rising that he \\"enjoyed a private income of ¬£900\\" per annum, plenty of which went to \\"the cause he espoused\\". The Irish Volunteers O'Rahilly was not party to the plans for the Easter Rising, nor was he a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), but he was one of the main people who trained the Irish Volunteers for the coming fight. The planners of the Rising went to great lengths to prevent those leaders of the Volunteers who were opposed to unprovoked, unilateral action from learning that a rising was imminent, including its Chief-of-Staff Eoin MacNeill, Bulmer Hobson, and O'Rahilly. When Hobson discovered that an insurrection was planned, he was kidnapped by the Military Council leadership. Learning this, O'Rahilly went to Patrick Pearse's school, Scoil √âanna on Good Friday. He barged into Pearse's study, brandishing his revolver as he announced \\"Whoever kidnaps me will have to be a quicker shot!\\" Pearse calmed O'Rahilly, assuring him that Hobson was unharmed, and would be released after the rising began. O'Rahilly took instructions from MacNeill and spent the night driving throughout the country, informing Volunteer leaders in Cork, Kerry, Tipperary, and Limerick that they were not to mobilise their forces for planned manoeuvres on Sunday. Easter Rising Arriving home, he learned that the Rising was about to begin in Dublin on the next day, Easter Monday, 24 April 1916. Despite his efforts to prevent such action (which he felt could only lead to defeat), he set out to Liberty Hall to join Pearse, James Connolly, Thomas MacDonagh, Tom Clarke, Joseph Plunkett, Countess Markievicz, Se√°n Mac Diarmada, Eamonn Ceannt and their Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army troops. Arriving in his De Dion-Bouton motorcar, he gave one of the most quoted lines of the rising ‚Äì \\"Well, I've helped to wind up the clock -- I might as well hear it strike!\\" Another famous, if less quoted line, was his comment to Markievicz, \\"It is madness, but it is glorious madness.\\" His car was used to fetch supplies during the siege, and later as part of a barricade on Prince's Street, where it was burned out. He fought with the GPO garrison during Easter Week. One of the first British prisoners taken in the GPO was Second Lieutenant AD Chalmers, who was bound with telephone wire and lodged in a telephone box by the young Volunteer Captain and IRB activist, Michael Collins. Chalmers later recalled O'Rahilly's kindness to him. In a statement to a newspaper reporter, he said that he was taken from the phone box after three hours and brought up to O'Rahilly, who ordered: \\"I want this officer to watch the safe to see that nothing is touched. You will see that no harm comes to him.\\" On Friday 28 April, with the GPO on fire, O'Rahilly volunteered to lead a party of men along a route to Williams and Woods, a factory on Great Britain Street (now Parnell Street). A British machine-gun at the intersection of Great Britain and Moore streets cut him and several of the others down. O'Rahilly slumped into a doorway on Moore Street, wounded and bleeding badly but, hearing the English marking his position, made a dash across the road to find shelter in Sackville Lane (now O'Rahilly Parade). He was wounded diagonally from shoulder to hip by sustained fire from the machine-gunner. According to ambulance driver Albert Mitchell (in a witness statement more than 30 years later), O'Rahilly still clung to life 19 hours after being severely wounded, long after the surrender had taken place on Saturday afternoon. The following is an extract:BMH (Bureau of Military History) WS 196. Sackville Lane joined Moore Lane and both were generally known as Moore Lane by Dubliners. Desmond Ryan's The Rising maintains that it \\"was 2.30pm when Miss O'Farrell reached Moore Street, and as she passed Sackville Lane again, she saw O'Rahilly's corpse lying a few yards up the laneway, his feet against a stone stairway in front of a house, his head towards the street.\\" Memorial The memorial in O'Rahilly Parade, Dublin. O'Rahilly wrote a message to his wife on the back of a letter he had received in the GPO from his son. Shane Cullen etched this last message to Nannie O'Rahilly into his limestone and bronze memorial sculpture to The O'Rahilly. The text reads:  The O'Rahilly House  40 Herbert Park, before demolition 40 Herbert Park, after demolition O'Rahilly's former home from 1910 - 1916, at 40 Herbert Park, was contentiously demolished in September 2020. Permission for the Edwardian building's demolition was given by , despite calls from various political parties for its preservation on grounds of its connection to the O'Rahilly. The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht had also earlier voiced its support for the retention of the three adjoining properties for architectural reasons. The council's own conservation section had been assessing the building for listing on the Record of Protected Structures having earlier passed over the building for protection on a number of occasions. Source of name In Gaelic tradition, chiefs of clan were called by their clan name preceded by the definite article, for example Robert the Bruce. O'Rahilly's calling himself \\"The O'Rahilly\\" was purely his own idea.

At the beginning it was thought that the files mostly contain the real names of agents who worked for the HVA in the former West Germany. Later it became clear that at least 90% of the persons never worked for or with the HVA. The Rosenholz files ended up in the hands of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the German reunification under unclear circumstances; they were initially analysed by the United States only, but finally returned to Germany in 2003 after long negotiations. The exact reason for the duration of the negotiations is still debated among scholars. According to the annals of the former Moscow CIA station chief Milton Bearden, the Rosenholz files were not seized on January 15, 1990, when demonstrators stormed the Ministry of State Security in East Berlin, but instead only when President George H. W. Bush personally contacted the chief of the Berlin CIA station. Bearden later lobbied for the return of the Rosenholz files to the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records () while CIA station chief in Bonn, and received the German government's Bundesverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit).

Other names by which this grass is known include dhaman grass, anjan grass, koluk katai and buffelgrass. Description African foxtail grass is a perennial grass growing to tall. The leaves are linear, long and wide. The flowers are produced in a panicle long and wide. Distribution African foxtail grass is native to tropical Africa, the Mediterranean region and the hotter and drier parts of Asia. It is a deep-rooted grass, tolerates drought, and will grow at altitudes of up to . It is considered a good forage grass in Africa. It prefers light soils with a high phosphorus content. It is also sown in Queensland, Australia and elsewhere for grazing, hay and silage. In the Sonoran Desert it was introduced for erosion control. In the Mexican part of the Sonoran Desert, it is still being planted and irrigated for livestock grazing. Cenchrus ciliaris has become naturalised and often an invasive species in Australia, the southwestern United States, Hawaii, Mexico, Central America, South America, and Macaronesia. As an invasive species It was introduced in the 1930s into Arizona, United States, to provide grazing. The introduction was largely unsuccessful but the grass began to appear as a weed beside highways and in cleared fields or over-grazed land. It spreads very quickly and will often kill local native plants such as palo verdes by taking away nearby water. This plant has a very low ignition threshold and can burn even during the peak growing season. Its flammability (injurious to neighbors) and quick regrowth allow it to compete successfully against almost all vegetation in the Sonoran Desert region.Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum: Buffelgrass. Another problem of buffelgrass in the Sonoran Desert is that it intensifies wildfires such that saguaro cacti that normally survive wildfires can erupt into flames when growing in areas taken over by the grass. In Queensland, Australia, the grass has also been attributed to causing a decline in the native grass species fed on by the critically endangered northern hairy-nosed wombat, and cited as a factor in the wombats' decline. In South Australia, it is a declared plant under the Natural Resources Management Act and weed management activities are guided by the South Australia Buffel Grass Strategic Plan (2012‚Äì17). In Australia's Northern Territory, invasive buffel grass was implicated in making fire control more challenging following the extensive wild fires that destroyed ancient trees in oases such as Standley Chasm in February 2019.https://www.alicespringsnews.com.au/2019/02/11/west- macs-blaze-questions-and-sorrow/ ReferencesExternal links ciliaris Category:Grasses of Africa Category:Flora of North Africa Category:Flora of Western Asia Category:Flora of Iran Category:Flora of Morocco Category:Grasses of India Category:Grasses of Pakistan Category:Flora of Sicily Category:Forages ","title":"Cenchrus ciliaris"},{"id":"2741805","text":"WPGB is a country radio station based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Owned by iHeartMedia, the station broadcasts on 104.7 MHz with an ERP of 13 kW. Its studios are located in Green Tree, while its transmitter is located in Pittsburgh. History WPGB's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD. =Beginnings as WPGH= Though the station first signed on the air as WYDD in 1967, its roots can be traced back to 1963 on 100.7 FM as WPGH and under the ownership of Gateway Broadcasting Enterprises, which also owned New Kensington-licensed AM station WKPA (now WMNY). 100.7 was also (and still is) licensed to New Kensington. Gateway owner Nelson L. Goldberg was interested in acquiring an improved FM signal with Pittsburgh market penetration. That opportunity presented itself in 1967, when a channel opened up for 104.7. To acquire the new signal, Goldberg had to spin off WPGH, which was purchased by Milton Hammond and moved to Millvale, where it was rechristened as big-band formatted WNUF-FM. That station is known today as WBZZ. =As WYDD= 104.7 adopted the WPGH call letters, but soon afterwards, the station changed to a full-time jazz format and changed its call letters to WYDD, for \\"the 'WYDE' world of Pittsburgh\\", using an elongated globe as its logo. A fragment of the jazz format remained as \\"Jazz Impressions\\", a weekend specialty smooth jazz show that premiered in 1976. The station would then move to a more freeform, progressive, underground AOR format throughout the 1970s, which would then shift into a Top 40/CHR format in the early to late 1980s. Throughout their run as a Top 40/CHR, WYDD used the monikers 104 WYDD, 104.7 WYDD, and Power 104.7 WYDD. The Stephen King book \\"Christine\\" (but not the movie of the same name) was set in a fictional suburb of Pittsburgh and mentioned both \\"WYDD\\" and its weekly \\"Block Party Weekend\\" multiple times. The \\"Block Party Weekend\\" was a playing of multiple songs by the same artist back-to-back. =As WNRJ= On May 17, 1989, at 7:30 p.m., the station became known as Energy 105, and brought about the call letter change to WNRJ. Before the changeover, the station manager at the time, Bob Hank, executed an early viral marketing plan by playing the song \\"What's On Your Mind (Pure Energy)\\" by Information Society non-stop in a loop for hours ‚Äî focusing on a repeat of the \\"Pure Energy\\" sample from Leonard Nimoy as Star Trek's Mr. Spock. The marketing stunt caused listeners to call emergency services concerned that some calamity befell the DJs and other station employees. Hank told reporters he was only trying to draw attention to the station's switch in format and new call letters. \\"We were just trying to draw a little bit of attention,\\" Hank said. \\"We never dreamed it would go this far.\\"http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1989/RR-1989-05-19.pdf \\"Energy\\" was led by WABC radio legend and consultant Rick Sklar and WYDD Program Director Tony Florentino. Among the talent hired for \\"Energy\\" was New York City native Mike Frazer, who remained in Pittsburgh and has been a part of WWSW since 1990, and Columbus, Ohio nighttime radio legend Suzy Waud. The format was successful in terms of ratings, but quickly became too costly to maintain. One of the chief competitors between Top 40 station WBZZ (then known as B94, now as KDKA-FM) and AOR-formatted WDVE, the station maintained a fairly consistent lineup until its sale to Salem Communications in 1989, ending more than two decades of local ownership. WYDD had its main studio located along with WKPA in New Kensington since its beginnings, but maintained a separate sales office at Gateway Towers in Pittsburgh for many years. =As WEZE= Gateway Broadcasting Enterprises had initially agreed to sell WYDD and its sister station WKPA to Salem Communications in 1987, but legal complexities between the two companies delayed the finalization to the end of December 1989. While initially reporting that WNRJ would keep its format, Salem officials announced the following month that the station would switch to an easy listening format, an unusual move at a time when established easy-listening stations were migrating towards soft adult contemporary music. The call letters were switched to WEZE, shared by Salem's co-owned AM station in Boston, and the easy-listening format was adopted on January 15, 1990, with the intent to switch from that format to Christian talk once the ministry contracts could be obtained.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1990/RR-1990-01-19.pdfhttp://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Billboard/90s/1990/BB-1990-01-27.pdf In April 1991, the studios were moved to Green Tree borough, located in Pittsburgh's South Hills, to Seven Parkway Center, Suite 625, one floor below WLTJ. The tower site was then moved later that same year from Murray Hill Road in East Deer Township (which was also half of WKPA's two-tower directional antenna array) to 750 Ivory Avenue, just off I-279 in Pittsburgh, the home of WPGH-TV. The much higher tower location allowed a power reduction to 13 kW, but a decades-long coverage problem for the southern suburbs of Pittsburgh was finally alleviated. =As WORD= In October 1991, Salem Communications completed its intended format switch to Christian Talk, mirroring the format adopted by its co-owned stations, and adopting the call sign WORD-FM. This station continues today at 101.5 FM. =As WXRB= After years of negotiations, the opportunity to purchase heritage Christian stations WPIT and WPIT-FM finally presented itself to Salem Communications. Salem purchased the station in early 1993, and though now legally permitted to hold 104.7 (thanks to duopoly) in addition to WPIT and WPIT-FM, Salem chose to spin off 104.7 to Entercom, licensee of WDSY-FM and the former WEEP. WPIT and WPIT-FM's facilities were moved to Greentree, and 104.7's operations were moved to WPIT's longtime home in downtown Pittsburgh at Gateway Towers, where it was joined by WEEP and WDSY. Both stations would remain there for about five years, until all three stations were split off and sold to three different owners. Operations for 104.7 would move temporarily to One Allegheny Square in Pittsburgh, and then finally to 200 Fleet Street in Greentree. After Entercom purchased the station, and after stunting briefly with a classic rock format as \\"US 104.7\\", on February 2, 1993, 104.7 changed to country, branded as 104.7 The Rebel, WXRB.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-02-05.pdfhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlaA5xhkPrg The station was to complement WDSY and WEEP, who targeted an older audience, while WXRB targeted a younger audience with its \\"Young Country\\" direction, which was very popular during that time due to a recent spike in country music listenership. =As WNRQ= On August 29, 1995, at 4 p.m., after stunting for a few days with snippets of songs from random genres, as well as redirecting listeners to WDSY, 104.7 flipped to alternative rock, branded as The Revolution 104.7, WNRQ, after modern rock had proven to be the mainstream following its success in other markets. The first song on \\"The Revolution\\" was \\"Send Me on My Way\\" by Pittsburgh band Rusted Root.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-09-01.pdf WNRQ was Pittsburgh's second FM alternative station, after WXXP's run from 1985 to 1988. The format would only last just shy of one year, due to the station being sold to Secret Communications, then- owner of WXDX, and who wanted to eliminate the overlap between the two stations.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-05-31.pdf; =As WJJJ= On June 1, 1996, after playing \\"Killing in the Name\\" by Rage Against the Machine, 104.7 flipped again, this time to smooth jazz, branding as Smooth Jazz 104.7 (with the WJJJ call letters instituted on June 28, 1996).http://nl.newsbank.com/nl- search/we/Archives?p_action=list&p;_topdoc=21 The WJJJ call sign was an obvious nod to WJJZ (106.1 FM) in Philadelphia. At 2 p.m. on May 24, 1999, the station flipped to urban oldies, branded as 104.7 The Beat.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1999/RR-1999-05-28.pdf \\"Pittsburgh's Jammin' Oldies\\" was widely popular, though management skewed the format towards more current material to attract a broad audience; this didn't help, as the station's ratings began to sink. The station changed its slogan to \\"Pittsburgh's Jammin' Hits\\" in a half- hearted attempt to attract new listeners, and modified its format towards Urban AC in 2003 to compete against WAMO. =As WPGB= On January 2, 2004, the station flipped to a Talk format, branded as NewsTalk 104.7. The current WPGB call letters took effect that day.WYDD on-air studio at 810 Fifth Avenue in New Kensington from the early 1970s until 1989, when this studio was converted to production use only. Note the WYDD \\"Heartbeat\\" logo from the early 1980s on the clock's face. WYDD had switched its call letters to WNRJ and moved into a more state-of-the-art studio that year. The studios were finally moved to Greentree in 1991. Announcer at the controls of the new WEZE on-air studio at Seven Parkway Center, Suite 625 in Greentree, April 1991. This location is now the main on-air studio for WORD-FM 101.5 During its ten years as a talk station, for most of that time The War Room with Quinn and Rose, a show hosted by longtime Pittsburgh disc jockey Jim Quinn, was flagshipped at WPGB. Quinn was dismissed in a contract dispute in November 2013. When WPGB was a talk station, its programming was fairly standard for a Clear Channel station of its type, a regional morning show (itself simulcast on several stations throughout northern Appalachia and New England), followed by Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, with Dave Ramsey and Andy Dean in the evening hours. From 6-8 p.m., Greg Henson hosted a sports talk show featuring interviews other local sports talk show hosts conducted earlier in the day on sister stations. Weekday newscasts were supplied by Cleveland station WTAM and Fox News Radio. * Wall Street Journal in the Morning * The Glenn Beck Program * Rush Limbaugh * The Sean Hannity Show * Coast to Coast AM with George Noory In addition, Glen Meakem hosted a program from 8-9:30am on Saturday and Sunday mornings. =Today= In July 2014, rumors surfaced that 104.7 would soon flip back to country, possibly named 104.7 The Bull to match similar stations in Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, Lexington, Portland, and Houston with the format and branding, following a decline of ratings from the previous November (when Quinn and Rose were still with the station), from a 4.1 rating to a 2.5 in the June 2014 Nielsen ratings. On August 7, 2014, Clear Channel sold off the entire intellectual property unit of WPGB's talk format to Frank Iorio, who was taking over operations of WJAS. WJAS dropped their longtime adult standards format at noon that day and began a three-hour simulcast of WPGB-FM (the duration of The Rush Limbaugh Show). Both stations replaced all local commercial breaks with sweepers prompting listeners to move to WJAS, interspersed with a heart monitor sound effect. At 3 p.m., WPGB abruptly cut away from the top-of-the-hour newscast (fed from the Total Traffic Network facilities in Cleveland) and, after playing a few song snippets poking fun at the format change - notably \\"No More Words\\" by Berlin - debuted a country music format as Big 104.7. The first song on \\"Big\\" was \\"This Is How We Roll\\" by Florida Georgia Line. WPGB Becomes Big 104.7 The new station launched with 10,000 songs in a row, and will now compete with WDSY and WOGI for Steel City country listeners. Currently, the station‚Äôs airstaff consists of Katie Oltmanns (Monday-Friday 10AM-3PM), Program Director JD Greene (Monday-Friday 3-7PM, Saturday 2-6PM), Travis Marzina (Monday-Friday 7PM-12AM, Saturday 6PM-12AM), and fill-in/swing host Jade Hilliard. Additionally, WPGB carries several national programs from Premiere Networks - The Bobby Bones Show (weekdays 6-10AM), CMT After MidNite with Cody Alan (daily 12-6AM), Country Top 30 (Sundays 8AM-12PM), and Women of iHeartCountry (Sundays 7-8PM). To round out their schedule, the station features programming from iHeartMedia‚Äôs Premium Choice network, which supplies the station with voice-tracked air talent from out-of-market from 10AM-2PM on Saturdays and during most hours on Sunday. WPGB-HD2 On April 25, 2006, Clear Channel announced that WPGB's HD2 subchannel will carry a smooth jazz music format, which was a previous station format under the call letters WJJJ. WPGB-HD2 currently airs a simulcast of sports-formatted WBGG 970 AM. Sports On September 12, 2006, Clear Channel and the Pittsburgh Pirates announced a five- year agreement in which WPGB would become the \\"new radio broadcast and strategic promotional partner of the Pirates beginning with the 2007 (Major League Baseball) season.\\" WPGB was the Pirates' flagship radio station, having replaced KDKA, which broadcast the first Major League Baseball game on radio (between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia Phillies) in 1921, and served as the Pirates' flagship station for 52 seasons (1955‚Äì2006). On July 6, 2010, the station was announced as the new home for the Duquesne Dukes men's basketball team. The station also lost its partnership with the Pittsburgh Pirates after the 2011 season to KDKA-FM.

US President Harry Truman called Congress to convene on that date during his acceptance speech two weeks earlier during the 1948 Democratic National Convention. The name \\"Turnip Day\\" comes from Missouri folklore.  Speech  Harry S. Truman circa 1947 With fewer than four months remaining before the 1948 presidential election, Truman's public approval rating stood at only 36 percent. Two years earlier, Congress had been won by the Republican Party for the first time in 15 years. His opponent, Thomas Dewey, seemed to be planning his own move to the White House. In search of a bold political gesture, the president turned to Article II, Section 3, of the Constitution, which provides that the president \\"may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses [of Congress], or either of them.\\" On rare occasions, presidents have called both houses into a special session to deal with urgent matters of war and economic crisis. On July 15, several weeks after the Republican-controlled US Congress had adjourned for the year and left much business unfinished, Truman took the unprecedented step of using his presidential nomination acceptance speech to call both houses back into session. He delivered the speech under trying circumstances. With no air conditioning, delegates sweltered in the Philadelphia convention hall's oven-like atmosphere. When Truman finally stepped before the cameras in the first televised Democratic convention in 1948, organizers had lost all hope of controlling the schedule. At 01:45 a.m., speaking only from an outline, Truman quickly electrified the tired delegates. In announcing the special session, he challenged the Republican majority to live up to its own platform from its own recently-concluded convention to pass laws to ensure civil rights, extend Social Security, and establish a national healthcare program. \\"They can do this job in fifteen days, if they want to do it.\\" he challenged. The two-week session would begin on July 26, 1948, called \\"Turnip Day\\" in Missouri.  Reaction  Republican senators reacted scornfully. To Arthur Vandenberg, it sounded like \\"a last hysterical gasp of an expiring administration.\\" However, Vandenberg and other senior Senate Republicans urged action on a few measures to solidify certain vital voting blocs. The chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, Robert A. Taft exclaimed, \\"No, we're not going to give that fellow anything!\\" Charging Truman with abuse of a presidential prerogative, Taft blocked all legislative action during the futile session. By doing so, Taft amplified Truman's case against the \\"Do-nothing Eightieth Congress\\" and arguably contributed to his November victory. Michael Straight, of the left-leaning, The New Republic quoted the Republican candidate Thomas E. Dewey as calling Truman's special session \\"a frightful imposition\\" but called it \\"a stroke of bold and liberal leadership and a confident reassertion of the Validity of American democracy.\\" Straight cited three \\"key issues\\" on which the 80th Congress had \\"failed utterly:\\" housing, inflation, and civil rights. The right-leaning TIME, which then had no bylines, cast doubt on Truman by leading its coverage with a question: \\"Was there really a pressing national emergency?\\" TIME also noted that no U.S. president had recalled Congress during an election year since 1856, under Franklin Pierce. It quoted US Senator Styles Bridges as calling Truman a \\"petulant Ajax from the Ozarks.\\"  Outcome  After eleven days, Congress sent two bills to the President for signing. One bill was to curb inflation, and the other was to encourage housing starts. Truman signed both bills but called them \\"inadequate.\\" The challenge energized Truman's Democratic supporters and put the Republican Party on the defensive.  Name  The name is taken from an old Missouri saying, \\"On the twenty-fifth of July, sow your turnips, wet or dry.\\" Truman chose the name because he was a Missouri native.

It placed a number of restrictions on Jews of England, most notably outlawing the practice of usury.Prestwich, Michael. Edward I p 345 (1997) Yale University Press. . Context Since the time of the Norman conquest, Jews had been filling a small but vital role in the English economy. Usury by Christians was banned by the Catholic Church at the time, but Jews were permitted to act as moneylenders and bankers. That position enabled some Jews to amass tremendous wealth, but also earned them the enmity of the English populace, Rubenstein, W.D. A History of the Jews p 36 (1996) Macmillan Press. . which added to the increasing antisemitic sentiments of the time, due to widespread indebtedness and financial ruin among the gentile population. Edward I returned from the Crusades in 1274, two years after his accession as King of England, and found that land had become a commodity, and that many of his subjects had become dispossessed and were in danger of destitution. Jews traded land for money, and land was often mortgaged to Jewish moneylenders. In January 1275 Edward's mother, the Queen Dowager Eleanor of Provence, expelled the Jews from all of her lands, a precursor to the Statute.Alison Taylor, \\"Cambridge, the hidden history\\", (Tempus: 1999) , p82 As special direct subjects of the monarch, Jews could be taxed indiscriminately by the King. Some have described the situation as indirect usury: the monarch permitting and encouraging Jews to practise usury and then taxing the profit. In the years leading up to the Statute, Edward taxed them heavily to help finance his forthcoming military campaigns in Wales, which commenced in 1277. One theory holds that he had exhausted the financial resources of the Jewish community when the Statute was passed in 1275. Provisions * Usury was outlawed in every form. * Debtors of Jews were no longer liable for certain debts. * Jews were not allowed to live outside certain cities and towns. * Any Jew above the age of seven had to wear a yellow badge of felt in the form of Two Tables Joined on his or her outer clothing, six inches by three inches. * All Jews from the age of 12 on had to pay a special tax of three pence annually. * Christians were forbidden to live among Jews. * Jews were licensed to buy farmland to make their living for the next 15 years. * Jews could thenceforth make a living in England only as merchants, farmers, craftsmen or soldiers. The provisions applied to both men and women. The license to buy land was included so that farming, along with trading, could give Jews an opportunity to earn a living with the abolition of usury. Unfortunately, other provisions along with widespread prejudice made this difficult for many. Glassman, David (1975).

MacHale. In this book, the main character, Robert \\"Bobby\\" Pendragon follows the antagonist, Saint Dane, to a territory called First Earth, which is essentially Earth in the year 1937. Plot summary Bobby Pendragon and Vo Spader, the Traveler from Cloral, arrive on Veelox a few weeks after the death of Bobby's uncle, Press Tilton, only to figure out from Aja Killian, the Traveler from Veelox, that Saint Dane went to First Earth. They flume there (New York City, 1937) to be greeted by bullets from gangsters that Saint Dane has hired. They then met the First Earth Traveler, who saved them from the gangsters. He is a bell captain at the Manhattan Tower Hotel named Vincent Van Dyke, nicknamed \\"Gunny\\". Bobby and Spader become employed as bellhops there, and investigate the ties between First Earth's Turning Point, rival crime godfathers Max Rose and Winn Farrow, and the Nazi party. The critical connection is revealed to be the Hindenburg zeppelin. To understand its significance, Bobby and Gunny visit Third Earth, in the 51st Century. The Traveler of Third Earth, Patrick, accesses a computer that predicts the future in which they save the Hindenburg: industrial spies working for Max would lead to the Nazis developing an atomic bomb and disastrously winning World War Two. Bobby and Gunny return to First Earth, only to find that Spader and Rose have gone ahead, seeking to stop Winn Farrow from shooting a firework rocket into Hindenburg. Bobby was flown to the LZ-129's launch site by a female aeroplane pilot called Nancy Olsen (Jinx), who has been his friend and client at the hotel. Once parachuting from the aeroplane, Bobby tracks down Max and Spader, who are seconds from departing to meet Max's airship arrival. Bobby accompanies them, and with Third Earth foresight, manages to save the entire entourage's lives. While on Third Earth, the young Traveler learns that Max Rose was destined to die on the same highway, on the same day, after crashing into a motorcycle cop. With Max unconscious and Spader, convinced stopping the Hindenburg will save First Earth, heading for the airfield, Bobby uses Max's car to follow them. Spader, misunderstanding, tries to stop the rocket from launching; Gunny holds him back, but fails. Spader tries to save the Hindenburg on his own, but is stopped by Winn Farrow. Spader begs Bobby to save the Hindenburg. Looking up, Bobby sees the faces of those who will die in the explosion and is reluctant to let them die. Gunny again intervenes, holding him until the rocket launches and the zeppelin burns. After the whole incident is over, Bobby is upset that Spader's emotions nearly got the better of him which almost lead to the destruction on all three earth territories. Bobby tells Spader to return to Cloral until he learns to control his emotions. Full of angst over his role in the tragedy, Bobby returns to his home on Second Earth (the 21st-century) for a pause in his Travels. After a week, he receives a call from Gunny, and meets him back at Bobby's old house a few hours later. Gunny arrives in a limousine with an elderly man claiming to know Bobby's great grandfather (unknowingly referring to Bobby when he was on First Earth), and explains how Uncle Press had died, describing how an accomplice (who the Gangster revealed to be Saint Dane) persuaded Tony, the gangster's partner, into shooting a Tommy Gun into the flume. He states clearly that he never fired a bullet. He then gives Bobby his Traveler ring which the gangster took from him on First Earth. Bobby thanks the gangster, and he and Gunny accompany the gangster down town to the flume. This is where The Reality Bug begins.

Gunny got his name because he simply couldn't fire a gun, no matter how hard he tried. *Maximillian Rose - A ruthless gangster who operates a spy ring out of the Manhattan Tower Hotel. Among his many criminal enterprises, he sells government secrets to the highest bidder, whether friend or foe. He supposedly dies trying to save all of his money, in the form of diamonds and valuable art, that were aboard the Hindenburg. *Nancy \\"Jinx\\" Olsen - A pilot for the Coast Guard who longs for adventure and finds it when Bobby asks her to fly to where the Hindenburg will be docking. Jinx's dream is flight, but the misogynistic Coast Guard has made her their poster girl, who simply goes around to conferences and talks to people about being a pilot. When Bobby says he must reach the Hindenburg's docking site, she has been grounded from flying by the Coast Guard, but she sees how important it is for Bobby, and does it anyway. *Winn Farrow - He is the nemesis of Max Rose who would stop at nothing to destroy Rose and his criminal empire. He hates Max because Max has become wealthy, whereas Winn's own, more reckless actions made him resort to living in an abandoned slaughterhouse in the Meatpacking District of New York and hiring gangsters to do his bidding. He is ultimately responsible for the blowing up of the LZ-129 (Hindenburg), for which he used a rocket. *Aja Killian - The Traveler from Veelox. She is the one who showed Bobby and Spader that Saint Dane flumed to First Earth from Veelox. At the end of the book, she contacts Bobby to tell him that he needs to come back to Veelox. *Patrick Mac -The Traveler from Third Earth. He plays a critical role when he shows Bobby and Gunny that the Nazis would win World War II if the Hindenburg is saved. *Ludwig Zell - A Nazi Operative who worked with Maximillian Rose. Bobby and Spader searched everything about Ludwig Zell or about the Hindenburg, but they came out with nothing. Saint Dane had murdered Zell and assumed his form to prevent him to the Nazis that the Hindenburg was in danger. *Peter Nelson - The gangster working for Winn Farrow. He is called Mr. Nervous Gangster because he is very hesitate about killing. He was brought to the flume to warn Bobby, Press and Spader on the territory of Cloral. *Tony - The Bold Gangster that works with Winn Farrow alongside with Peter Nelson. He is the gangster in charge when Bobby and Spader got to First Earth. Later on Tony got pushed off the Manhattan Tower Hotel by Saint Dane. He was the one who stole Bobby's Traveler ring.

It is widely used in surveying and construction to measure height differences and to transfer, measure, and set heights of known objects or marks. It is also known as a Surveyors level, Builders level, Dumpy level or the historic \\"Y\\" level. It operates on the principle of establishing a visual level relationship between two or more points, for which an inbuilt telescope and a highly accurate bubble level are used to achieve the necessary accuracy. Traditionally the instrument was completely adjusted manually to ensure a level line of sight, but modern automatic versions self-compensate for slight errors in the coarse levelling of the instrument, and are thereby quicker to use. The optical level should not be confused with a theodolite which can also measure angles in the vertical plane. Description Stadia marks on a crosshair while viewing a metric levelling rod. The top mark is at 1.5 m and the lower is at 1.345 m. The distance between the marks is 0.155 m, multiplied by the 100:1 stadia ratio yields a distance to the rod of 15.5 m. An optical level consists of a precision telescope with crosshairs and Stadia marks. The cross hairs are used to establish the level point on the target, and the stadia allow range-finding; stadia are usually at ratios of 100:1, in which case one metre between the stadia marks on the levelling staff represents 100 metres from the target. The complete unit is normally mounted on a tripod, and the telescope can freely rotate 360¬∞ in a horizontal plane. The surveyor adjusts the instrument's level by coarse adjustment of the tripod legs and fine adjustment using three precision levelling screws on the instrument to make the rotational plane horizontal. The surveyor does this with the use of a bull's eye level built into the instrument mount. The surveyor looks through the eyepiece of the telescope while an assistant holds a vertical level staff which is a graduated in inches or centimeters. The level staff is placed with its foot on the point for which the level measurement is required. The telescope is rotated and focused until the level staff is plainly visible in the crosshairs. In the case of a tilting level, the fine level adjustment is made by an altitude screw, using a high accuracy bubble level fixed to the telescope. This can be viewed by a mirror whilst adjusting or the ends of the bubble in a \\"split bubble\\" display can be viewed within the telescope. This also allows assurance of the accurate level of the telescope whilst the sight is being taken. However, in the case of an automatic level, altitude adjustment is done automatically by a suspended prism due to gravity, as long as the coarse levelling of the instrument base is accurate within certain limits. When level, the staff graduation reading at the crosshairs and stadia marks are recorded, and an identifying mark or marker placed where the level staff rested on the object or position being surveyed. Invention In 1832, English civil engineer and inventor William Gravatt, who was commissioned to examine a scheme for the South Eastern Railway's route from London to Dover, became frustrated with the slow and cumbersome operation of the \\"Y\\" level during the survey work, and devised the more transportable easier to use \\"dumpy\\" level,, so called because of its shorter appearance. The telescope of the historic \\"y\\" level is held in two brass arms, which are part of the mount and the telescope could be easily removed to allow sighting reversal though 180 degrees or an axial rotation of the telescope; both to compensate for optical collimation errors. Because the telescope is not fixed to the level adjusting mechanism, the Y instrument is assembled and disassembled for each sighting station. However, the dumpy level is permanently secured to its two support arms and the levelling mechanism, thereby reducing measurement uncertainty and considerably reducing the time taken to set up the instrument. The Dumpy uses the same basic principle of level sighting. Survey operation Diagram showing relationship between two level staff, or rods, shown as 1 and 3. The level line of sight is 2. After careful setup of the level, the height of the cross hairs is determined by either sighting from a known benchmark with known height determined by a previous survey or an arbitrary point with an assumed height is used. Sighting is done with an assistant surveyor who holds a graduated staff vertical at the point under measurement. The surveyor rotates the telescope until the graduated staff is in the cross hairs and records the reading. This is repeated for all sightings from that datum. Should the instrument be moved to another position within sighting distance, it is re-levelled, and a sighting taken of a known level in the previous survey. This relates any new levels to the previous levels. The backsight level reading is always subtracted from the foresight level reading, and that equals the change in elevation between the two points, which is why this method is referred to as differential levelling. The other method of levelling in surveying is called trigonometric levelling, which involves the direct use of the total station (or any outdated instrument that reads angles), to read the vertical (zenith) angle to a prism rod, and uses the trigonometric functions to obtain the change in elevation. Variants A \\"Y\\" level. The telescope can be removed and reversed or rotated to remove errors. The Y level or wye level is the oldest and bulkiest of the older style optical instruments. A low-powered telescope is placed in a pair of clamp mounts, and the instrument then leveled using a spirit level, which is mounted parallel to the main telescope. The term dumpy level (also builder's level) endures despite the evolution in design. They can be manual or automatic - the latter being much quicker to set up. A tilting level is a variant which has a precision vertical adjustment screw which tilts both the telescope and the high accuracy bubble level attached to it to make them level. This reduces the complete reliance on the levelling accuracy of the instruments's bottom mount, and the \\"split bubble\\" display gives additional assurance that the telescope is level whilst taking the sight. This allows faster operation as the bottom mount need not be truly level, though it will introduce a slight error as the vertical axis of the mount is not completely co-incident with the telescope centre. The split bubble works by displaying half of both ends of the bubble side by side in the telescope and when the curved ends are aligned it is level. An automatic level, self-levelling level, or builder's auto level includes an internal compensator mechanism (a swinging prism) that, when set close to level, automatically removes any remaining variation. This reduces the need to set the instrument base truly level, as with a dumpy level. Self- levelling instruments are the preferred instrument on building sites, construction, and during surveying due to ease of use and rapid setup time. A digital electronic level is also set level on a tripod and reads a bar-coded staff using electronic laser methods. The height of the staff where the level beam crosses the staff is shown on a digital display. This type of level removes interpolation of graduation by a person, thus removing a source of error and increasing accuracy. During night time, the dumpy level is used in conjunction with an auto cross laser for accurate scale readings. A transit level also has the ability to measure both the altitude and azimuth of a target object with respect to a reference in the horizontal plane. The instrument is rotated to sight the target, and the vertical and horizontal angles are read off calibrated scales Johnson level news File:DumpyLevel.jpg A modern automatic optical level with a horizontal transit readout.

It is a cornerstone of the Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH). HOTP was published as an informational IETF RFC 4226 in December 2005, documenting the algorithm along with a Java implementation. Since then, the algorithm has been adopted by many companies worldwide (see below). The HOTP algorithm is a freely available open standard. Algorithm The HOTP algorithm provides a method of authentication by symmetric generation of human-readable passwords, or values, each used for only one authentication attempt. The one-time property leads directly from the single use of each counter value. Parties intending to use HOTP must establish some ; typically these are specified by the authenticator, and either accepted or not by the authenticated: * A cryptographic hash method, H (default is SHA-1) * A secret key, K, which is an arbitrary byte string, and must remain private * A counter, C, which counts the number of iterations * A HOTPvalue length, d (6‚Äì10, default is 6, and 6‚Äì8 is recommended) Both parties compute the HOTPvalue derived from the secret key K and the counter C. Then the authenticator checks its locally-generated value against the value supplied by the authenticated. The authenticator and the authenticated increment the counter, C, independently of each other, where the latter may increase ahead of the former, thus a resynchronisation protocol is wise. RFC4226 doesn't actually require any such, but does make a recommendation. This simply has the authenticator repeatedly try verification ahead of their counter through a window of size, s. The authenticator's counter continues forward of the value at which verification succeeds, and requires no actions by the authenticated. The recommendation is made that persistent throttling of HOTPvalue verification take place, to address their relatively small size and thus vulnerability to brute force attacks. It is suggested that verification be locked out after a small number of failed attempts, or that each failed attempt attracts an additional (linearly- increasing) delay. 6-digit codes are commonly provided by proprietary hardware tokens from a number of vendors informing the default value of d. Truncation extracts 31 bits or \\\\log_{10}\\\\left(2^{31}\\\\right) ‚âà 9.3 decimal digits, meaning, at most, d can be 10, with the 10th digit providing less extra variation, taking values of 0, 1, and 2 (i.e., 0.3 digits). = Bidirectional authentication = After verification, the authenticator can authenticate itself simply by generating the next HOTPvalue, returning it, and then the authenticated can generate their own HOTPvalue to verify it. Note that counters are guaranteed to be synchronised at this point in the process. =HOTPvalue= The HOTPvalue is the human-readable design output, a d-digit decimal number (without omission of leading 0s): : HOTPvalue = HOTP(K, C) mod 10d That is, the value is the d least significant base-10 digits of HOTP. HOTP is a truncation of the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) of the counter, C (under the key, K, and hash function, H). : HOTP(K, C) = truncate(HMAC(K, C)) Truncation first takes the 4 least significant bits of the MAC and uses them as a byte offset, i. : truncate(MAC) = extract31(MAC, MAC[(19 √ó 8) + 4:(19 √ó 8) + 7] √ó 8) That index i is used to select 31 bits from MAC, starting at bit i * 8 + 1. : extract31(MAC, i) = MAC[i √ó 8 + 1:i √ó 8 + (4 √ó 8) ‚àí 1] Note that 31 bits is a single bit short of a 4-byte word. Thus, the value can be placed inside such a word without using the sign bit (the most significant bit). This is done to definitely avoid doing modular arithmetic on negative numbers, as this has many differing definitions and implementations. Example Python Implementation: import hmac def hotp(key, counter, digits=6): c = counter.to_bytes(8, byteorder='big', signed=False) mac = hmac.new(key, c, 'sha1').digest() i = mac[-1] % 16 truncated = int.from_bytes(mac[i:i + 4], byteorder='big', signed=False) % 2 ** 31 return truncated % 10 ** digits Tokens Both hardware and software tokens are available from various vendors, for some of them see references below. Hardware tokens implementing OATH HOTP tend to be significantly cheaper than their competitors based on proprietary algorithms. As of 2010, OATH HOTP hardware tokens can be purchased for a marginal price. Some products can be used for strong passwords as well as OATH HOTP. Software tokens are available for (nearly) all major mobile/smartphone platforms (J2ME, Android, iPhone, BlackBerry, Maemo, macOS, and Windows Mobile). Reception Although the reception from some of the computer press has been negative during 2004 and 2005, after IETF adopted HOTP as RFC 4226 in December 2005, various vendors started to produce HOTP compatible tokens and/or whole authentication solutions. According to a paper on strong authentication (entitled \\"Road Map: Replacing Passwords with OTP Authentication\\") published by Burton Group (a division of Gartner, Inc.) in 2010, \\"Gartner's expectation is that the hardware OTP form factor will continue to enjoy modest growth while smartphone OTPs will grow and become the default hardware platform over time.\\" See also * Initiative For Open Authentication * S/KEY * Time-based One-time Password algorithm  References External links * RFC4226: HOTP: An HMAC-Based One-Time Password Algorithm * RFC 6287: OCRA: An HMAC-Based OATH Challenge-Response Algorithm * Initiative For Open Authentication * Step by step Python implementation in a Jupyter Notebook Category:Internet protocols Category:Cryptographic algorithms Category:Computer access control protocols ","title":"HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm"},{"id":"2741890","text":"Christian Ehregott Weinlig (September 30, 1743 ‚Äì March 14, 1813) was a German composer and cantor of Dresden's Kreuzkirche.

Meade at the Battle of Gettysburg and in many other important battles of the American Civil War. Early life and Civil War service Baldy was born and raised on the western frontier and at the start of the Civil War was owned by Maj. Gen. David Hunter. His name during this period is unknown. It is said that he was wounded anywhere from five to 14 times during the war, starting at the First Battle of Bull Run, where he was struck in the nose by a piece of an artillery shell. Soon after, in September 1861, he was purchased from the government by Meade in Washington, D.C., for $150 and named Baldy because of his white face. Despite Baldy's unusual, uncomfortable pace, Meade became quite devoted to him and rode him in all of his battles through 1862 and the spring of 1863. The horse was wounded in the right hind leg at the Second Battle of Bull Run, and at Antietam, he was wounded through the neck and left for dead on the field. He survived and was treated. At Gettysburg, on July 2, 1863, Baldy was hit by a bullet that entered his stomach after passing through Meade's right trouser leg. He staggered and refused to move forward, defying all of Meade's directions. Meade commented, \\"Baldy is done for this time. This is the first time he has refused to go forward under fire.\\" Baldy was sent to the rear for recuperation. In 1864, having returned to duty for the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg, he was struck in the ribs by a shell at the Weldon Railroad, and Meade decided that Old Baldy should be retired. Retirement and death Baldy was sent north to Philadelphia and then to the farm of Meade's staff quartermaster, Captain Sam Ringwalt, in Downingtown, Pennsylvania. He was later relocated to the Meadow Bank Farm, owned by a friend of the Meade family, where he remained for several years. He was moderately active in retirement and Meade rode the horse in several memorial parades. His last parade was as the \\"riderless horse\\" in the funeral procession of his master, in November 1872. Baldy lived another 10 years. He was euthanized on December 16, 1882, at the age of 30, when he became too feeble to stand. On Christmas Day of that year, two Union Army veterans (Albert C. Johnston and H.W.B. Harvey) disinterred Baldy's remains and decapitated him, sending the head to a taxidermist. Baldy's remains Baldy's head was mounted on a plaque in a glass case and displayed in the Grand Army of the Republic Civil War Museum and Library in Philadelphia. In 1979, his head was loaned to the Old Baldy Civil War Round Table, which paid for its restoration and placed it on exhibit in the Meade Room of the Civil War Museum of Philadelphia. The latter museum closed in August 2008, pending a relocation, and most of its artifacts were distributed to other museums, including the Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center. Attorneys for the two museums reached an agreement under the auspices of the Philadelphia Orphans' Court in December 2009 to return Old Baldy to the GAR museum on Griscom Street.Colimore.

The 84-acre (34-hectare) patch of rough pasture, near Fairborn, northeast of Dayton, is the place where the Wright brothers (Wilbur and Orville) undertook the difficult and sometimes dangerous task of creating a dependable, fully controllable airplane and training themselves to be pilots. Many early aircraft records were set by the Wrights at the Huffman Prairie. History The Wrights began using Huffman Prairie in 1904 with the permission of the field's owner, Dayton banker Torrence Huffman. Its location along an interurban rail line from the brothers' hometown of Dayton provided them with easy access. The Wrights made about 150 flights at the field in 1904‚Äì1905, leading to development of the 1905 Wright Flyer III, which they considered to be the first practical airplane. This aircraft has been restored, and is now displayed at the Carillon Historical Park in Dayton. In 1910, the Wright Company placed its testing operations at Huffman Prairie Flying Field; the Wright Company also operated its Wright Flying School on the site. Through the Flying School, the Wright Company trained more than a hundred pilots, including the aviators for the Wright Exhibition Team and early military aviators, including Henry H. \\"Hap\\" Arnold and Thomas DeWitt Milling. The United States Army Signal Corps purchased the field in 1917 and renamed it, along with 2,000 adjacent acres (8 km¬≤), Wilbur Wright Field. In 1948 the area was merged with nearby Patterson Field to become Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Start of the first flight of Flyer III, June 23, 1905, Orville at the controls. The catapult tower, which they began using in September 1904, is at right. It helped accelerate the aircraft to takeoff speed. The Flyer looks virtually identical to the previous two powered versions, but noticeably different from its later appearance, after the Wrights extended and enlarged the elevator and rudder. The two men are probably Wilbur (running behind the airplane) and Charles Edward Taylor (at right), the Wrights' mechanic who built their first aircraft engine. Huffman Prairie Flying Field Historic Site The National Park Service currently operates this historic site where visitors may see the place where the Wrights developed the world's first practical airplane as well as replicas of their 1905 hangar and launching catapult. While the historic flying field is mowed short, simulating the grazed pasture used by the Wrights and allowing its use for re-enactment flights, an adjacent area of tall-grass prairie is maintained unmowed, managed instead using late-season controlled burns. A nature trail winds among the prairie's tall grasses, diverse wildflowers, and occasional shrubs. The Huffman Prairie area is located within the Air Force Base, with a separate entrance and fencing between it and an adjacent runway and other modern base facilities. The associated Huffman Prairie Flying Field Interpretive Center is located about 2 miles (3.2 km) from the flying field near the Wright Memorial, on a hilltop overlooking Huffman Prairie and other parts of the Air Force Base. This facility addresses the specific problems Orville and Wilbur Wright encountered while they were perfecting their flying machine, their first demonstration flights in the United States and in Europe, their exhibition team, and their manufacturing facility in Dayton, Ohio. The center also highlights the continuing legacy of Orville and Wilbur Wright as embodied in the development of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the continuing aeronautical research at this Air Force facility. Huffman Prairie Flying Field was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1990, and added to the U.S. World Heritage Tentative List as part of the Dayton Aviation Sites listing in 2008. and UNESCO page for tentative designation for components of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park In 1986, of the natural portion of the Huffman Prairie was designated as an Ohio Natural Area. It is a component of the National Aviation Heritage Area.

From 1944 to 1946 he was called up for military service in the French Army in Indochina shortly before the First Indochina War took place there. He caught malaria during that time and, in consequence of the disease, was left hard of hearing. From 1947 to 1948 he had different engagements at theatres and touring companies not only in France, but also in the French part of Allied-occupied Germany and in Florence, e. g. ‚ÄúTourn√©e Spectacles Moyses‚Äù, Teatro della Pergola.

Although it ordered Protestants to readopt traditional Catholic beliefs and practices, including the seven Sacraments,Acton, et al., p. 264. it allowed for Protestant clergymen the right to marry and for the laity to receive communion in both kinds (bread and wine).Kagan, p. 367 It is considered the first significant step in the process leading to the political and religious legitimization of Protestantism as a valid alternative Christian creed to Roman Catholicism finally realized in the 1552 Peace of Passau and the 1555 Peace of Augsburg. The Interim became Imperial law on 30 June 1548.Johann Kurtz, History of the Christian Church, volume 3 pg 320Pastor, vol 12 pp 409-453 The Pope advised all bishops to abide by the concessions made to the Protestants in the Interim in August 1549.Ludwig Pastor, History of the Popes, volume 12 pg 440-41 The Schmalkaldic War and the Battle of M√ºhlberg In June 1546, Pope Paul III entered into an agreement with Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to curb the spread of the Reformation. This agreement stated, in part: > In the name of God and with the help and assistance of his Papal Holiness, > his Imperial Majesty should prepare himself for war, and equip himself with > soldiers and everything pertaining to warfare against those who objected to > the Council [of Trent], against the Smalcald League, and against all who > were addicted to the false belief and error in Germany, and that he do so > with all his power and might, in order to bring them back to the old faith > and to the obedience of the Holy See.Bente, p. 219 Shortly thereafter, Maurice, the Duke (and later, Elector) of Albertine Saxony, invaded the lands of his rival and stepbrother in Ernestine Saxony, John Frederick, beginning the brief, but devastating, conflict known as the Schmalkaldic War. The military might of Maurice combined with that of Charles V proved to be overwhelming to John Frederick and the Protestant Schmalkaldic League. On 24 April 1547 the armies of the Schmalkaldic League were decisively defeated at the Battle of M√ºhlberg. Following the defeat of the Schmalkaldic League at M√ºhlberg, Charles V's forces took and occupied the Lutheran territories in quick succession. On 19 May 1547 Wittenberg, the heart of the Reformation, and final resting place of Martin Luther‚Äôs remains, fell to the Emperor without a fight. The Interim Charles V had won a military victory, but realized that the only chance he had to effectively contain Lutheranism as a movement was to pursue political and ecclesiastical compromises in order to restore religious peace in the Empire. The series of decrees issued by the Emperor became known as an ‚ÄúInterim‚Äù because they were only intended to govern the church temporarily pending the conclusions of the general council convened at Trent by pope Paul III in December 1545. The first draft of the twenty-six chapter decree was written by Julius von Pflug, but several theologians were involved in the final draft: on the Catholic side, Michael Helding, Eberhard Billick, Pedro Domenico Soto and Pedro de Malvenda; on the Protestant side, John Agricola.Ludwig Pastor, History of the Popes, volume 12 pg 413 Included in the provisions of the Interim was that the Lutherans restore the number of sacraments (which the Lutherans reduced to two - Baptism, the Lord's Supper) and that the churches restore a number of specifically Roman ceremonies, doctrines, and practices which had been discarded by the Lutheran reformers, including also transubstantiation, and the rejection of the doctrine of justification by grace, through faith alone. The God-given authority of the pope over all bishops and the whole Church was reaffirmed, but with the proviso that \\"the powers that he has should be used not to destroy but to uplift\\". In stark contrast to Charles V's past attitude, significant concessions were made to the Protestants. What was basically a new code of religious practices permitted both clerical marriage and communion under both kinds. While the Mass was reintroduced, the offertory was to be seen as an act of remembrance and thanks, rather than an act of propitiation as in traditional Catholic dogma. The Interim went further in making significant statements on other matters of dogma such as justification by faith, the veneration of the saints, and the authority of the Scriptures. Even such details as the practice of fasting was breached upon.Joachim Whaley, Germany and the Holy Roman Empire, Oxford University Press, 2012, vol. 1, pp. 321-324. This attempt by the emperor to devise a formula to which both Catholics and Protestants of Germany could subscribe was objected to outright by the Catholic Electors, the prince-bishops and the pope even before the decree was published. Therefore, as a decree, the Interim applied only to the Protestant princes, who were given just 18 days to signify their compliance.Whaley, vol. 1, p. 324. Despite the fact that Philip Melanchthon, friend of Luther and co- architect and voice of the Reformation movement, was willing to compromise these issues for the sake of peace, the Augsburg Interim was rejected by a significant number of Lutheran pastors and theologians. > Pastors who refused to follow the regulations of the Augsburg Interim were > removed from office and banished; some were imprisoned and some were even > executed. In Swabia and along the Rhine River, some four hundred pastors > went to prison rather than agree to the Interim. They were exiled, and some > of their families were killed or died as a result‚Ä¶Some preachers left for > England (McCain et al., 476). As a result of the Interim, many Protestant leaders, such as Martin Bucer, fled to England, where they would influence the English Reformation. Charles V tried to enforce the Interim in the Holy Roman Empire, but was only successful in territories under his military control, such as W√ºrttemberg and certain imperial cities in southern Germany.M Rady, The Emperor Charles V, (1988), p84 There was a great deal of political opposition to the Interim. Many Catholic princes did not accept the Interim, worried about rising imperial authority. The papacy refused to recognise the Interim for over a year, as it saw it as an infringement of its own jurisdiction.S Macdonald, Charles V, (2000), p104 The Leipzig Interim In a further effort to compromise, Melanchthon worked on a second \\"Interim\\". Charles's ally during the Schmalkaldic War, Maurice of Saxony, along with Melanchthon and his supporters, worked out within Maurice's estates a compromise known as the Leipzig Interim in late 1548. Despite its even greater concessions to Protestantism, it was barely enforced.M Rady, p84 Protestant leaders rejected the terms of the Augsburg Interim. The Leipzig Interim was designed to allow Lutherans to retain their core theological beliefs, specifically where the doctrine of justification by grace was concerned, while yielding in other, less important matters, such as church rituals. This compromise document again drew opposition. Those who supported the Leipzig Interim became identified as Philippists, as they supported Melanchthon's efforts at compromise. Those who opposed Melanchthon became known as \\"Gnesio-Lutherans\\", or \\"genuine\\" Lutherans. Elector Maurice, seeing that the Leipzig Interim was a political failure, began making plans to drive Charles V and his army from Saxony. It was, in his estimation, \\"more expedient for him [Maurice] to be viewed as a champion of Lutheranism than as a traitor\\" (McCain et al., 480). On 5 April 1552, Maurice attacked Charles V's forces at Augsburg and the latter was forced to withdraw. This victory eventually resulted in the signing of the treaties of Passau (2 August 1552) and Augsburg (1555). These two treaties resulted in the principle \\"Cuius regio, eius religio\\" ‚Äì He who rules, his the religion ‚Äì allowing the ruler of a territory to set the religion therein.

Three: symbol of plurality The basic symbol for plurality among the ancient Egyptians was the number three: even the way they wrote the word for \\"plurality\\" in hieroglyphics consisted of three vertical marks (    ). Triads of deities were also used in Egyptian religion to signify a complete system. Examples include references to the god Atum \\"when he was one and became three\\" when he gave birth to Shu and Tefnut, and the triad of Horus, Osiris, and Isis. ;Examples *The beer used to trick Sekhmet soaked three hands into the ground. *The second god, Re, named three times to define the sun: dawn, noon, and evening. *Thoth is described as the ‚Äúthrice-great god of wisdom‚Äù. *A doomed prince was doomed to three fates: to die by a crocodile, a serpent, or a dog. *Three groups of three attempts each (nine attempts) were required for a legendary peasant to recover his stolen goods. *A boasting mage claimed to be able to cast a great darkness to last three days. *After asking Thoth for help, a King of Ethiopia was brought to Thebes and publicly beaten three further times. *An Ethiopian mage tried‚Äîand failed‚Äîthree times to defeat the greatest mage of Egypt. *An Egyptian mage, in an attempt to enter the land of the dead, threw a certain powder on a fire three times. *There are twelve (three times four) sections of the Egyptian land of the dead.

Although the various individuals all existed, their interconnection is not entirely certain. Several of the seven were linked with the Qingtan school of Daoism as it existed in the state of Cao Wei. The Seven Sages found their lives to be in danger when the avowedly \\"Confucian\\" Jin dynasty of the Sima clan came to power. Among other things, some of the seven wrote poems criticizing the court and the administration, and wrote Daoist- influenced literature. Not all seven sages had similar views. Some of the seven tried to negotiate their way through the difficult political positions by self-consciously adopting the roles of alcohol-fueled pranksters and eccentrics avoiding government control (for example, Liu Ling), yet some ended up joining the Jin dynasty (for example Wang Rong). However much they may or may not personally engaged in qingtan, they became the subjects of it themselves in the A New Account of the Tales of the World (). The Seven Sages The Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove (1616) by Li Shida of the Chinese Ming dynasty The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove (with a boy attendant), in a Kano school Japanese painting of the Edo period The Seven Sages are Ji Kang (aka Xi Kang), Liu Ling, Ruan Ji, Ruan Xian, Xiang Xiu, Wang Rong and Shan Tao. Ji Kang was especially close to Ruan Ji; their relationship was described as \\"stronger than metal and fragrant as orchids\\". The wife of Shan Tao was said to be impressed by Ruan Ji and Ji Kang's prowess when she spied on them during sexual intercourse.Hinsh, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. University of California Press. pp. 68- 69 As it is traditionally depicted, the group wished to escape the intrigues, corruption and stifling atmosphere of court life during the politically fraught Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history. They gathered in a bamboo grove near the house of Ji Kang in Shanyang (now in Henan province) where they enjoyed, and praised in their works, the simple, rustic life. This was contrasted with the politics of court. The Seven Sages stressed the enjoyment of alcoholic beverages, personal freedom, spontaneity and a celebration of nature. It would be Ji Kang's refusal to work for the new regime which would eventually lead to his execution. The group's rural life became a common theme for art, and they inspired other artists who wished to retreat during times of political upheavals. Another person associated with the Seven Sages is Rong Qiqi (Ê¶ÆÂïüÊúü), who in fact lived quite earlier. This association is depicted in some apocryphal art from the fourth century CE, in a tomb near Nanjing. The Seven Sages, or the symbol that they became, have been remarked to be influential in Chinese poetry, music, art, and overall culture.

Some cross-react with self-antigens. For example, in rheumatic fever, antibodies against group A streptococcal cell walls can also react with (and thus damage) human heart tissues. These are considered heterophile antibodies. In clinical diagnosis, the heterophile antibody test specifically refers to a rapid test for antibodies produced against the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis. Heterophile antibodies can cause significant interference in any immunoassay.An immunoassay is a biochemical test, frequently used in medical diagnostic testing, that measures the presence or concentration of a macromolecule in a solution through the use of an antibody or immunoglobulin. The presence of a heterophile antibody is characterized by broad reactivity with antibodies of other animal species (which are often the source of the assay antibodies). Such antibodies are commonly referred to as human anti- animal antibodies (HAAA). Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) belong to this category. They can create both false positive and false negative results.The Ghost in the assay tube: heterophil antibody interferences in immunoassays ‚Äì an ever-recurring but often forgotten problem. Communiqu√©: A Mayo Reference Services Publication. 2003; 28(3):1‚Äì4. So-called 'sandwich' immunoassays are particularly susceptible to this interference. (Sandwich immunoassay = two- site, noncompetitive immunoassays in which the analyte in the unknown sample is bound to the antibody site, then labeled antibody is bound to the analyte. The amount of labeled antibody on the site is then measured. It will be directly proportional to the concentration of the analyte because labeled antibody will not bind if the analyte is not present in the unknown sample. This type is also known as sandwich assay as the analyte is \\"sandwiched\\" between two antibodies.) Heterophile antibodies may thus give false positives (by bridging the capture and signal antibody) or false negatives (by blocking one or the other). Both detecting and deterring this interference is difficult in clinical medicine. One option is to repeat the test using a different type of assay. Other options include the use of heterophile blocking reagents, steps to remove immunoglobulins, serial dilutions and using non-mammalian capture and/or detection antibodies. Heterophile antibody interference usually doesn't change linearly with serial dilution, but a true result most often will. This is one strategy for heterophile antibody detection. However, there are cases where heterophilic antibodies will give a linear response to dilutions, as well as immunoassays that do not change linearly upon dilution, meaning that the method is not fool-proof. Blocking heterophile antibody interference can be achieved by removal of immunoglobulins from a sample (such as with PEG), by modifying antibodies which may be present in a sample or by using buffers to reduce interference. Heterophile antibodies are of particular importance in clinical medicine for their use in detecting Epstein-Barr Virus (the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis). EBV infection induces the production of several antibody classes, of which heterophile antibodies are one (others include anti-i, rheumatoid factor and ANA). Heterophile antibodies are IgM antibodies with affinity for sheep and horse red blood cells. They appear during the first week of infectious mononucleosis symptoms, 3‚Äì4 weeks after infection and return to undetectable levels 3 to 6 months after infection. Heterophile antibody is a fairly specific but insensitive test for EBV. It is present in 80% of infected teens and adults, 40% of all infected children, and only 20% of infected children under 4. Heterophile antibodies can arise in non-EBV infections. False positive monospot tests may occur in cases of HIV, lymphoma or lupus. Other assays for detection of EBV are available, including serologic markers.ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. Daniel De Mais. ASCP Press 2009. An important clinical pearl for heterophile antibodies is they can also be seen in genetic immunodeficiencies. There have been case reports where women have undergone an exploratory laparotomy for suspected ectopic pregnancy after having a falsely elevated beta-hCG test, only to find out later they actually have selective IgA deficiency. Thus, another possible cause of false positives in a pregnancy test are heterophile antibodies, commonly seen in EBV infection as well as selective IgA deficiency.

His stage name was bestowed on him in 1998 when he left David Lee Roth and joined the rock group Marilyn Manson as their guitarist, taking over for Zim Zum. Still going by the name \\"John 5\\", Lowery has since become the guitarist for Rob Zombie. He is also a solo artist having recorded nine guitar albums: Vertigo (2004), Songs for Sanity (2005), The Devil Knows My Name (2007), Requiem (2008), The Art of Malice (2010), God Told Me To (2012), Careful With That Axe (2014), Season of the Witch (2017), Invasion (2019). He also has a remix album, Remixploitation (2009), and a live album, It's Alive (2018). He also works as a staff writer for Chrysalis Records, working with artists such as Matt Ball, Avril Lavigne, Rob Halford, k.d. lang, Garbage, Meat Loaf, Scorpions, Ozzy Osbourne, Slash, FeFe Dobson, Steve Perry, and has written and recorded with Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd.  Early life  Lowery was born in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. He first started playing guitar at seven after watching Buck Owens and Roy Clark's television show Hee Haw with his dad. Specifically, Lowery recalls seeing a young Jimmy Henley playing banjo that drew his inspiration. His parents supported his playing as long as it did not interfere with his education. He also took guitar lessons from Detroit guitarist Robert Gillespie who taught him classic blues and rock & roll. They also accompanied him at the adult bars he would play during the evening. His early musical influences came from the Monkees, Kiss, guitarists Eddie Van Halen, Randy Rhoads, Jimi Hendrix, Yngwie Malmsteen, and country music.  Music career  1987‚Äì1995: Early career = Lowery started his career as a session guitarist having moved to Los Angeles from Michigan at age 17. His first band in L.A. was Alligator Soup, which led to an important meeting with Rudy Sarzo from Whitesnake who recruited Lowery for his band Sun King giving him his first real bit of exposure. This also saw him meeting producer Bob Marlette, who has worked with, among others, Tracy Chapman, Alice Cooper, Rob Halford and Black Sabbath. Lowery began working on numerous projects with Marlette including television show soundtracks, movie soundtracks including Speed 2: Cruise Control, and commercials and infomercials. This in turn saw Lowery being picked to play with Lita Ford, opening up for Kiss. He started another long time friendship with the various Kiss members, including a close friendship with Paul Stanley which resulted in his guesting on Stanley's Live to Win album. Lowery's next role saw him working with Randy Castillo, in the short- lived projects Bone Angels and Red Square Black, who issued the Square EP via Zoo/BMG. The band disbanded when Lowery was picked to play with k.d. lang on tour. = 1996‚Äì1998: 2wo = In 1996, Lowery heard that Marilyn Manson was looking for a guitarist and attempted to cold-call the studio Manson was working with to request an audition, but was hung up on, as the guitarist role had already been given to Zim Zum. Lowery teamed up with then-former Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford, along with Sid Riggs (drums) James Wooley (keyboards), and Ray Riendeau (bass) to work on an industrial metal-inspired album, under the band name of 2wo (Two). The subsequent album (Voyeurs) was remixed by Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) and was released on Reznor's Nothing Records label, under the parent company Interscope Records (Universal). The album was not a commercial hit but did produce one video, made by director Chi Chi Larue, for the first single \\"I am a Pig\\". It featured some S&M; scenes and so was not widely broadcast. But the video was not banned as has been previously rumored. The band embarked on a world tour and were part of the Ozzfest line-up, but the tour was pulled and 2wo disbanded. = 1998‚Äì2003: David Lee Roth = Arguably, John 5's first truly \\"big break\\" came when he was selected by former Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth to play lead guitar on the critically well-received 1998 release DLR Band. Regarding how he came to meet Roth, in Guitarist Magazine, Lowery relates that, \\"when I was little, my dream was to play with David Lee Roth. One day I was sitting at my friend's house and... I wonder[ed] what... Roth is doing now. [In 1997, Roth had just been let go from Van Halen for a second time in favor of Gary Cherone, and also penned a tongue-in-cheek memoir.]. I'm gonna call up his manager and see if he needs any songs.\\" John 5 submitted six tracks that he had written to Roth's management. Having been a longtime fan of David Lee Roth's work, both in Van Halen and as a solo artist, Lowery believed that he knew exactly what Roth would like. On hearing Lowery's songs, Roth was very impressed and subsequently asked for Lowery to submit several more songs. At the time, Roth was choosing between Lowery and Mike Hartman as to who would play lead guitar. (Hartman would also play bass on the album under the moniker, \\"B'urbon Bob\\".) Tragically, B'urbon Bob would die a short time later. Impressed by John 5's prodigious skill, Roth scheduled a meeting and then scheduled a recording session that lasted two weeks and resulted in the fourteen track DLR Band album. \\"I remember before we started, he [David Lee Roth] said, 'If you can't do it in two takes, you can't do it.'\\" In 2003, while still lead guitarist for Marilyn Manson, Lowery (then called John 5) was invited by David Lee Roth to write and record the single non-cover song for Roth's 2003 album Diamond Dave. In 2014, John 5 announced a new album with David Lee Roth, which he hoped would come out in the future. = 1998‚Äì2004: Marilyn Manson = After the recording of Mechanical Animals, Marilyn Manson was again looking for a guitarist to replace Zim Zum who had been dismissed from the band during the recording process. Again John went to try out for the band. Following a tour with Rob Halford in Europe, John received a call from Manson's manager asking if he would like to meet Manson for lunch. At the meeting Manson asked John to join the band. Lowery accepted and Manson gave him the name \\"John 5\\". As Lowery put it, \\"right then and there. It was obviously something he'd been thinking about.\\".von Lupton, Aaron. \\"5 Across the Ears\\". Rue Morgue Magazine, April 2016, p. 19. 5 signed on for the Mechanical Animals tour and to work on the next album. His first live performance for Marilyn Manson came on the MTV Video Music Awards. During the opening bars of \\"The Beautiful People\\" at the 2003 Rock Am Ring festival Manson was moving across the stage when he hit Lowery's guitar and chest with his boot. Lowery was outraged and threw his guitar while screaming at Manson, which led to much speculation. According to Lowery, the Grotesk Burlesk tour had been a high-pressure endeavour, and just weeks before he had suffered losses of very close family members. Lowery later commented on his behavior, calling it unprofessional and stating that there was no bad blood between Manson and him. During this time period, Lowery also worked on a band called Plague with Jason Lowetz as the frontman. The album was produced with Bob Marlette but never made it out of the studio. Lowetz was considered for the job as frontman for Velvet Revolver before Scott Weiland took it on. In 2004, Lowery and Manson parted company. Confusion was rife as certain press reported that he had been dumped unceremoniously from the band, but in reality the two came to a mutual agreement that they wanted to go their separate ways. \\"What actually happened was, at the end of the tour, we were just on different roads. It was completely amicable. He just wanted to write with other members of the band, and I wanted to do other things.\\" While working with Manson, Lowery stated that Manson may have harboured resentment toward him since he does not do drugs or drink alcohol, whereas Manson \\"is not like that.\\" However, Lowery claims Manson never stated this explicitly to him, and remains unclear on why or whether Manson has ill will toward him. = 2005‚Äì2006: Loser = In 2005, Lowery formed the band Loser. Recruiting vocalist Joe Grah, Charles Lee on bass, and Glendon Crain on drums, they began working on their debut album Just Like You. The band was also partly co- founded by friend and producer Bob Marlette. Vocalist Joe Grah already had a significant amount of success in his home state of Texas, with the band Jibe. Marlette recommended Grah to Lowery, and so Lowery hopped on a plane to Texas to see the band play. Grah flew back to L.A. and was hired on the spot. The name Loser came about as an affirmation to Lowery's past: \\"I was from Grosse Pointe, Michigan, which is kind of an upper-class area, and I was always that rock kid,\\" John explained. \\"I started playing guitar at age 7. I always had a rock shirt on, and I had that tattoo early on. I looked like a loser because everyone around me was wearing Polo and Brooks Brothers. But now if you go into a club wearing Polo, you're called a loser. So I think everyone can relate to that name, and the album title, Just Like You, sums it up.\\" The band had initial success not long after signing with Island Records, when the track \\"Disposable Sunshine\\" became part of the Fantastic Four soundtrack. During this time, during the recording of the soundtrack, Crain briefly left the band and was replaced by drummer Elias Andra, a friend of Lee's. Andra had some success himself with the band Psycho Plague, his own creation, an industrial metal band, which toured as a headline act with Linkin Park as an opening act at the time. However, Andra soon left after promotional shots had been taken, and Crain returned. Andra went on to become the drummer for Julien-K. At the same time, Lowery was also working for Rob Zombie and a working conflict occurred. As Zombie was also touring, Lowery tried to find a live replacement for him while Loser were touring on conflicting dates. However, even with promo material for the debut album out and a release date in the bag, Island Records did not like the idea of Loser without John and so dropped the band from the label. \\"Being the founding member of Loser, my decision to leave was not an easy one\\", said John 5 in a press release. \\"I've been juggling two careers both with Loser and Rob Zombie for over one year now. I found it impossible to be in two places at once.\\" The album has been put on the backburner, and no word on a release date has ever been issued. The official Loser Myspace page has tracks available for download (working on April 11, 2012). = 2005‚Äìpresent: Rob Zombie = John 5 performing with Rob Zombie in 2006 While Lowery was working with Loser, he also began to work with cult rock artist and movie director Rob Zombie. Meeting at the Camp Freddy benefit gig, Lowery and Zombie hit it off immediately and Rob asked Lowery to play with him at Ozzfest 2005. \\"I'm totally ecstatic about having the opportunity to play with Rob on Ozzfest! He has been one of my favorite artists for the longest time. I had the opportunity to play with him a few weeks back and never thought that I would have the chance to share the stage with him playing the Zombie songs we all know and love!\\" It was reported that Zombie was looking to quit the music industry to concentrate on his movie career until he began to work with Lowery. \\"Camp Freddy asked me to do this benefit, just to play one song, at the Arrowhead Pond (in Anaheim, California) for this tsunami relief thing. And John was there, and we played one song, 'Thunderkiss,' and it kicked ass and he's a supercool guy and I was like, 'this is perfect.' John said, 'Do you need a guitar player for Ozzfest?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'I wanna do it,' I said, 'Perfect, done.'\\" -Rob Zombie on John 5 Lowery worked on Rob Zombie's 2006 album Educated Horses, co-writing eight out of eleven tracks with Zombie. When he left Loser, Lowery took up the role of Rob Zombie guitarist as a permanent gig. \\"Rob is the best I have worked with. He's great. We have a great time on stage together. It has been the single greatest experience I have had working with someone, hands down.\\" John is also the guitarist on Rob's latest albums, Hellbilly Deluxe 2, released February 2, 2010, Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor, released April 23, 2013, and The Electric Warlock Acid Witch Satanic Orgy Celebration Dispenser, released April 29, 2016. In early 2011, Lowery was joined by fellow ex-Marilyn Manson bandmate, Ginger Fish, as a member of Rob Zombie's band. Zombie/Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison was in Europe with his band Murderdolls, leaving Zombie without a drummer for some shows during the American leg of their tour. Lowery asked Fish to fill in as drummer. In April 2011, Fish was announced as the new and permanent drummer. Nova Rock 2014 In October 2011, Zombie confirmed by his Facebook account that Lowery would be scoring the soundtrack for Rob Zombie's latest movie, The Lords of Salem. This was also confirmed on the official John 5 website. = 2004‚Äìpresent: Solo career = Starting in 2004 with Vertigo, Lowery has recorded eight instrumental records. His works have featured many guest players. For example, Songs for Sanity had Albert Lee, and other records have had Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Jim Root. In 2009, John released a remix album, Remixploitation. Lowery has also released an instructional DVD entitled The Devil Knows My Name (2007). In July 2009, on his Twitter page, John 5 announced that he is now six tracks into the next solo album. On October 2, 2009, he played with Slash at a tribute to the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. In a Twitter update January 6, 2010, John 5 had this to say about the progress of his upcoming fifth studio album; \\"Just did all the guitar, bass for my new solo CD, Tommy Clufetos played the drums and killed it!\\" and a following Twitter update January 8; \\"Did the photo shoot for the new record today!\\", January 18: \\"Just had Billy sheehan play on the song (ya dig), this record is going to rule\\". In June 2011, John 5 officially closed his MySpace page. John commented on his own website, \\"There are a number of reasons, mainly the decline of Myspace as a platform to reach you, the fans. ... So today, the steps were taken to close the account at the Myspace page.\\" He often names his songs after famous murderers, e.g. Edward Gein (\\"Gein with Envy\\", Songs for Sanity,) Albert Fish (\\"Werewolf of Westeria\\", The Devil Knows My Name), or torture devices (see any song from Requiem). In February 2014, while giving an interview at the Soundwave festival John 5 announced his seventh solo album entitled \\"Careful with That Axe\\", which would go on to be released in August of that year. John 5 released his eighth solo album titled Season Of The Witch on March 3, 2017. He released his first live album, It's Alive, in early 2018 and toured in the early and late months of 2018 in support of it. John 5 released his ninth solo album entitled \\"Invasion\\" on July 31, 2019. He was on the road in early and late 2019 in support of the \\"Invasion\\" album. In January through March 2020, John 5 & The Creatures opened for Queensryche. John is currently working on his next live album/DVD and documentary entitled Invasion Live.  Personal life  John 5 married pornographic actress Aria Giovanni in 2002, but they divorced in 2006. He then married hair stylist Rita Aghajani on June 7, 2009. John 5 has three children: sons Jeremy and Andres, and daughter Nicole. He is an avid Kiss collector, concentrating on merchandise, clothing, and promotional items from 1973-1983. His collection is the focus of his knightsinsatanservice Instagram account. In turn, thejohn5collection Instagram account focuses on John 5 collectibles. John 5 often performs riffs on his social media accounts featuring at least one of his Sphynx cats.

The station, which is hosted in the basement of Carnegie Mellon's University Center, is run by students, staff, faculty, and community members. WRCT broadcasts on 88.3 MHz with an ERP of 1.75 kW, from atop Warner Hall (also on the Carnegie Mellon campus, but heard throughout the city). The license is held by WRCT Radio Incorporated.  History  WRCT was born as an experimental radio station at then-Carnegie Institute of Technology. It began as the project of a group of engineering students in 1949, who first used the electrical wiring in a few academic buildings to broadcast a weak AM signal to campus buildings for several hours a day. In 1950, WRCT, which stands for Radio Carnegie Tech, covered half the buildings on campus, and became an official student organization.McCoy, Adrian. \\"WYEP, WRCT plan anniversary specials.\\" Post-Gazette.com. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 10 Apr. 2009. Web. 2 Feb. 2012. http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09100/961838-67.stm. WRCT went on the air in 1949 as a carrier current AM radio station on 900 kHz (mostly heard on campus), but it moved to 88.3 FM on March 1, 1974, with a power of 10 watts, which extended its signal beyond the campus to other areas nearby. In the late 1980s, the power increased to 100 watts, and in 1994, WRCT received permission to increase power to 1,750 watts in the north, south, and west and 680 watts in the east, which enabled it to be heard up to 15 miles away, allowing it to become a more significant community service. Now the station has made it possible to listen anywhere in the world by streaming the audio on the station's website.Cullen, Rob. \\"The Eclectic and Eccentric WRCT FM .\\" Pittsburgh news for tech, arts, hiring ‚Äì Pop City. Rob Cullen, 12 Nov. 2008. Web. 3 Feb. 2012. http://www.popcitymedia.com/features/wrct1112.aspx Now the station has expanded to serve beyond the campus, it also allows participation from outside the university. DJs, producers, engineers and staff consist of both community members, as well as undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and staff who are connected to the school. Participation includes a range of skill levels, from freshmen DJs who are just learning about the stations' programming to veteran DJs who have years of experience on the air and a dedicated following. All of these positions are volunteer and nonprofit. For anyone to get involved, they must simply call the station or e-mail the training director. Programming WRCT's programs, updated each semester, are available online at their program guide. =Music= WRCT's mission is to present its listening audience with freeform, original programming that cannot be found elsewhere on the Pittsburgh dial. As such, the station's musical programming is widely varied, and with few exceptions, left entirely to the tastes of the on-air DJs. Genres including Alt-Country, Jazz, Hip hop, Metal, Experimental, Indie rock, Blues, International, Electronic, and even Musical Theater are among those commonly represented in rotation. They try to show off local music that people do not typically hear on mainstream stations. They do their best to play ‚ÄúCreative beats, conscious lyrics and fresh styles from up- and-comers who just plain aren't getting heard about because they don't fit the formula‚Äù.Levy, Doug. ‚ÄúOwen Carmichael.‚Äù CMJ New Music Report, n.d. https://books.google.com/books?id=vrIO1R87sXIC&pg;=PA28&dq;=wrct+carnegie+mellon+radio&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=MDMrT5j9L8figgeIn- HxDw&ved;=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;=wrct%20carnegie%20mellon%20radio&f;=false =Public affairs= WRCT broadcasts much more than just music. Public affairs programming also features prominently at the station, with an emphasis on news and issues local to the Pittsburgh community. WRCT is Pittsburgh's Pacifica Radio affiliate station. These ideas that are broadcast generally would not be on the radio anywhere else.

The station's own DJs provided the music in both rooms. The bash went from 9p.m. until 2 a.m. with an admission price of only $5. The lineup at AVA consisted of Zombo, Jason the Underwater Culprit, Shawn Watson, J. Malls and DJ Thermos, and the Shadow Lounge consisted of It's Tina, Kimmy+Sandi, DJ Sanspoof, Arsenal+JTS and DJ Firefly. The Shadow Lounge's Blue Room also included performances by Steve Boyle of \\"Radio Free Radio\\" and Alex and Sal. The neighboring Waffle Shop, which is Carnegie Mellon's student-run, late-night waffle shop, served waffles to the post-dance crowd The station also launched a revamped Website to occur with the anniversary celebration.

In the 1960s, he became a favourite actor of Spanish horror director Jes√∫s Franco and began starring in many low-budget horror films produced in Spain or France, often portraying a mad doctor named \\"Dr. Orloff\\". Life and career Vernon was born Mario Lippert in Baden-Baden, Germany, to a Swiss father and an American mother, and was fluent in German, English and French. Originally a stage and radio actor, he worked primarily in France and became a well-known supporting actor after 1945 by playing villainous Nazi officers in French films. Jean- Pierre Melville's Le Silence de la mer, in which he played a gentle anti-Nazi German officer, made him somewhat famous, but, in part due to his looks and Swiss accent, he was subsequently relegated to playing gangsters and heavies. In the 1960s, he became a favorite actor of Spanish horror director Jes√∫s Franco and began starring in many low-budget horror movies produced in Spain or in France, often portraying a mad doctor named \\"Dr. Orloff\\". He continued to make increasingly small appearances in high-profile films while often getting top billing in many Grade-Z horror films. Horror fans consider his three greatest horror film roles to be The Awful Dr. Orloff (1961) which introduced Franco's famed mad doctor character, Dracula vs Frankenstein (1971) in which he played Count Dracula and The Erotic Rites of Frankenstein (1972) in which he played the insanely evil Count Cagliostro. Death He remained active until his death from natural causes in 1996. He died in Paris, France, 10 days after his 88th birthday. Selected filmography *Boule de Suif (1945) ....

Life Homilius was born in Rosenthal, Saxony, the son of a Lutheran pastor, and was educated at the Annenschule in Dresden. He then studied law at Leipzig University and the organ under Johann Sebastian Bach. From 1742 he was organist at the Dresden Frauenkirche, and from 1755 until his death cantor at the Kreuzkirche in Dresden with the associated responsibility of music director at the Kreuzkirche, the Sophienkirche, and the Frauenkirche. After the destruction of the Kreuzkirche during the Seven Years' War he worked mainly at the Frauenkirche. Works Homilius predominantly composed church music: more than 10 passions (one printed in 1775; his St. Matthew Passion, particularly outstanding in the preclassical style of C.P.E. Bach and an extremely worthy successor of J.S. Bach's best-known work of the same name, has been recorded on CD), an oratorio for Christmas (1777) and one for Easter, over 60 motets, more than 150 cantatas (six arias from these appeared in 1786), chorales, preludes, and choral works. He composed also organ music: 36 Chorale preludes for organ. His students included eminent composer Daniel Gottlob T√ºrk. His vocal compositions enjoyed great popularity through the 19th century, as witnessed by the large number of copies still extant.

The station, which is purchased by Martz Communications Group (through its Radio Power subsidiary) from Langer Broadcasting in December 2010, broadcasts on 660 kHz on the AM dial with a power of 1,400 watts, daytime only (to protect the nighttime signal of WFAN in New York City on the same frequency), and is licensed to Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania. Its studios and AM transmitter are located in Braddock east of Pittsburgh. It operates a translator, W297BU on 107.3 FM in Wilkinsburg. Station history WAMO's translator on a SPARC HD Radio with RDS. The station was originally on 1470 kHz, and licensed to Portage, Pennsylvania, halfway between Johnstown and Altoona. This station began as WWML, and had operated as a daytime-only station for much of its history since signing on back in the early 1960s. Through the years and format and callsign changes, (usually between country and oldies) it finally received nighttime power authorization in the early '90s, allowing it to operate at night with a limited power of 88 watts. Though successful financially in its earlier years, the station and its FM sister, then known as WZGO, experienced a sharp decline in the mid 80's, as did the local economy, in part due to the collapse of the region's rich steel-producing and coal-mining industries. Under FCC rules which permit a station owner to move a daytime-only station and change its frequency, the station was relocated to the Pittsburgh area with a new frequency and city of around 2004. On 660, the station first signed on with the call letters WCIX. On 1470, it had previously been known as WWML, WRML, WHYM, WZGO, and WFJY (its final calls before the move). The station had operated Langer's \\"National Radio Network\\" programming lineup, but that network ceased operations in March 2010 and its format thereafter was unknown. Martz planned to put an Urban/Urban AC format on the station, returning this programming to the Pittsburgh market for the first time since WAMO and WAMO-FM were sold to Catholic broadcasters in 2009. On May 21, 2011, WPYT and translator W261AX (100.1 FM) signed on with the promised mainstream urban format, but they have always had a shift towards Rhythmic Contemporary. At the end of 2011, they changed their slogan to \\"Pittsburgh's home for Hip-hop and Hottest Hits\\" and became an official Rhythmic Contemporary station. On June 3, 2011, the station changed its call sign to WAMO, marking the return of the callsign and format after two years. This is WAMO's fourth incarnation in Pittsburgh, as it originally broadcast on 860 AM, later with a simulcast on 105.9 FM before being moved to 106.7 in 1996. In January 2013, WAMO was added to BDS' Rhythmic Airplay panel as an indicator reporter, but is not considered a monitored reporter because it is not rated in Nielsen Audio (as Martz is a non-subscriber) and in part due to being an AM daytimer with an FM translator, this despite having a primary emphasis on R&B;/Hip-Hop material. That would change by 2017 when it became a monitored R&B;/Hip-Hop reporter in both BDS and Mediabase. BDS would return WAMO back to the Rhythmic panel as a monitored reporter in February 2019 due to a adjustment in its musical direction. On June 25, 2019, at 11 a.m., WAMO changed formats from rhythmic contemporary (which continues on WBZZ-HD3 and W261AX) to urban adult contemporary, branded as \\"107.3 The Beat\\".107.3 The Beat Launches in Pittsburgh Radioinsight - June 25, 2019 On October 16, 2020, WAMO announced that the \\"WAMO 100\\" hip hop programming would move to 107.3 on November 2, marking the fourth FM frequency to carry the \\"WAMO\\" brand and the return of the hip hop format to the 660 frequency; W261AX will concurrently be repurposed as an FM translator for KDKA (1020 AM).

It began as an umbrella group of many English-speaking organizations and institutions in the province, with approximately 15,000 members. At its height in the mid-1980s, the group had a network of affiliated anglophone groups throughout the province. However, a prolonged decline in influence, group cohesion, membership and funding ultimately led to its closure in 2005.  Early years ‚Äî constructive engagement: 1982‚Äì1989  The Parti Qu√©b√©cois (PQ), a party that supports the sovereignty of Quebec and the dominant use of French in most areas of public and business life, won a majority in the Quebec National Assembly (the province's legislature) in 1976. The vast majority of Quebec anglophones (i.e., Quebecers who speak English as a first language), who at that time made up approximately 13% of Quebec's population (see Language demographics of Quebec), did not support this party. Some anglophones formed local lobby groups to promote federalism and argue against new laws such as the Charter of the French Language (also known as \\"Bill 101\\"). After the Parti Qu√©b√©cois was re-elected in 1981, several of these groups (notably the \\"Positive Action Committee\\" and the \\"Council of Quebec Minorities\\") joined together in May 1982, as \\"The Alliance of Language Communities in Quebec\\" (or \\"Alliance Qu√©bec\\") in an effort to gain more influence and to start a province-level dialogue between linguistic groups. AQ's ideology reflected a desire to promote the rights and interests of the English language community while recognizing there were legitimate goals being pursued by the provincial government in promoting the French language, such promotion having strong support in the majority Francophone population. Alliance Quebec's best-known accomplishments from its earliest years included: * Alliance Quebec's first success was to lobby the PQ to amend Bill 101. In 1983, the Charter of the French Language was amended (Law 57) to recognize in its preamble to the Charter of the French Language the institutions of the Anglophone community in Qu√©bec, abolish language testing for people educated in Quebec, and to widen the use of English in Anglophone communities and public institutions. * Alliance Quebec also worked to get English language health and social service guarantees. As a result, in 1986, Law 142 was enacted which compels regional authorities to draw up programmes for access in the English language to health and social services throughout Quebec. * With the financial support and legal leadership of Alliance Quebec, Bill 101's prohibition of English language signs was challenged in court. In 1988, in its decision Ford v. Quebec (Attorney General), the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that the prohibition of all other languages but French on public signs and posters and in commercial advertising was in opposition to the freedom of expression but opened the door to the clear predominance of French. This solution was ultimately adopted by the Government of Quebec and prevails to this day. The group had widespread grassroots volunteer activity in its early years. It formed at least 20 regional chapters, including 8 in the anglophone neighbourhoods of Montreal. The federal government subsidized AQ in an effort to promote minority official language groups in the province, providing it with most of AQ's budget ($1.4 million in 1986). Similar funding was provided to French language groups outside Quebec. In addition to AQ's regional chapters, six federally funded anglophone groups outside of Montreal became affiliated with AQ and sent delegates to its annual convention. Affiliated Quebec anglophone universities, CEGEPs and health and social service institution and community associations were also allowed to send delegates. Institutional members brought AQ substantial public policy expertise and participated in the policy formulation process. By the end of the 1980s, AQ claimed to have 40,000 people on its membership list (including members of regional associations affiliated with AQ, such as the Townshippers' Association). This led to critiques that people who did not renew their memberships were not removed from this list and that the actual number of dues-paying members hovered around 5,000.Graeme Decarie, CJAD 800 radio (August 1989); see also Prosperi at p.59. Many of Alliance Quebec's founders were active in the Liberal Party of Quebec, the main opposition party while the PQ was in government. The Liberal Party of Quebec won the provincial election of 1985, and many of AQ's initial leaders were recruited to work for the new government. Several of AQ's highly educated and bilingual early staff members went on to become Liberal cabinet ministers in later years, such as Thomas Mulcair, Kathleen Weil, and Geoffrey Kelley (Jacques-Cartier), while others served as MNAs‚ÄîRussell Williams (Nelligan), Russell Copeman (NDG). While this initially gave AQ strong lobbying contacts within the government, the departure of many of the group's founding leaders eventually hurt the group. Some have argued that the 1985 election was the beginning of a decline in influence of Alliance Quebec, as English-speakers believed the new government was friendlier and so the need for AQ was lower, while the Liberals had more connections with English-speakers than the PQ and so relied less on AQ to transmit their points of view. The group also faced criticism, almost since its founding, that it was not aggressive enough in its demands. In December 1988, AQ's offices were destroyed in a case of arson. Then-president Royal Orr sued Le Journal de Montr√©al and T√©l√©-M√©tropole, for falsely reporting that he was the \\"prime suspect\\" in setting the blaze. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.  Middle years ‚Äî stagnation and infighting: 1989‚Äì1998  AQ's weakened bargaining position was brought to prominence in 1989 when the Liberal government passed Bill 178. Although the Liberal Party had campaigned in 1985 to loosen the legal restrictions on languages other than French, Bill 178 overturned the Supreme Court's \\"Ford\\" decision (see above), restoring the prohibition on non-French commercial signage (with an exception for small signs inside stores). Alliance Quebec's inability to prevent the adoption of Bill 178 by the Liberal government it had perceived as an ally, opened it to criticism from the anglophone community. Right-wing critics of AQ dubbed it \\"Compliance Quebec\\" and \\"the lamb lobby\\" for its perceived unwillingness to challenge the government.Mordecai Richler, Oh Canada, Oh Quebec: Requiem for a Divided Country (Toronto: Penguin Books, 1992), 38. Internal tension arose among the directors of AQ over the issue of denied access to English language schools in the province. Tensions increased over whether or not to support the Liberals in the Quebec general election of 1989 in spite of Bill 178. Some prominent AQ leaders urged a protest vote by anglophones, either by spoiling their ballots or voting for the upstart Equality Party that opposed the Liberals' legislation. The Equality Party won four seats in the National Assembly in 1989, but quickly lost its support due to infighting, garnering only 0.3% of the vote in 1994. Rebuffed at the ballot box, some of the Equality Party's remaining active members instead concentrated on winning elected positions in Alliance Quebec in order to have AQ promote the Equality Party's platform (notably, favouring a complete repeal of all mandatory use of French in Quebec, and partitioning Quebec in the event of independence). Public infighting between so-called \\"moderates\\" (sympathetic to the Liberal Party) and \\"radicals\\" (the remaining members of the Equality Party) within AQ throughout the 1990s, along with a gradual decrease in interest among the general Quebec population in language politics, led to the marginalization of AQ in the province's politics. While infighting preoccupied the board of directors and annual convention, the grassroots elements of AQ became less active. Government funding allowed for a permanent staff for the group, which relied less and less on volunteers. AQ's smallest regional chapters, in Quebec's Magdalen Islands, Lower North Shore and Baie-Comeau, closed down for lack of members,Two members of these closed chapters could attend the annual convention: see Laurentianweb, \\"Alliance Quebec Information: Regional Community Organizations\\" while six of the group's eight chapters on the Island of Montreal merged in order to avoid closing.The new Montreal Chapter could send six times as many delegates to the annual convention as the other chapters; see LaurentianWeb, \\"Alliance Quebec Information\\" In 1996, the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec investigated alleged irregularities during the 1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum, finding among other things that votes in three mainly federalist ridings had been rejected without valid reasons. Alliance Quebec sued the Quebec government to try to force it to re-examine the rejected ballots in all 125 Quebec ridings. The trial judge ruled against AQ in 2000. AQ appealed, but ceased operations in 2005 (see below). In 2008 the Chief Electoral Officer got the court's permission to destroy the ballots after ruling that AQ's appeal had taken too long.  Final years ‚Äî radicalization and closure: 1998‚Äì2005  In May 1998, the group elected a \\"radical\\" president, Montreal Gazette columnist William Johnson. Previously a vocal critic of AQ, he won by rallying a group known derisively as \\"angryphones\\" (mainly members of the tiny Equality Party and some listeners of right wing talk radio shows, particularly the Howard Galganov show). He in turn supported Equality Party members for positions on AQ's board of directors. Unlike previous presidents, he made no attempt to meet with political leaders, preferring to conduct his lobbying through media, such as on radio talk shows. Also unlike previous presidents, who generally accepted the objectives of Bill 101 and focused on changing how it was applied, Johnson questioned the commitment to tolerance and human rights of those who supported Bill 101.See e.g., W. Johnson, \\"The Historical Background of the Situation of English-speaking Quebecers\\", quoted in Language and Language Laws in Quebec After his election, Johnson organized two demonstrations against stores, in particular Eaton's and The Hudson's Bay Company, that did not place English on their in-store advertising (which was once again legal after amendments to the Charter of the French Language in 1994). Johnson told a crowd of demonstrators that he refused an Eaton's offer to put up English signs in their stores if AQ would quietly call off the protest, as Johnson wanted to make it a public issue. Johnson also had AQ's constitution amended to add his view that Canada's federal government should refuse to recognize a Quebec unilateral declaration of independence. Johnson also made headlines when the Entartistes threw a cream pie in his face while he marched in Montreal's 1998 Saint-Jean- Baptiste Day parade. Johnson's presidential campaign and his first six months as president temporarily brought more media attention and members to Alliance Quebec, as the PQ government and Quebec nationalist groups publicly criticized AQ's new, more confrontational tone. However, Johnson called off the group's protests in October 1998 and AQ's media coverage fell considerably, never to recover. Johnson's presidency and those of his similarly minded successors also provoked a negative reaction from the mainstream community of anglophones that formerly supported AQ. Links to the community's key healthcare, educational and community institutions vanished. Several events during these years highlighted the group's lack of support, which ultimately caused it to close down: * half of the group's board of directors (those not associated with the Equality Party) quit the group en masse in May 1999, calling Johnson \\"a bully and a publicity hound\\";(Toledo Blade, May 7, 1999) * in a study published in 2000, only 16% of Quebec anglophones named Alliance Quebec as the group that best protected their interests; * the number of members of AQ declined steadily (4,198 members in May 1998; 2,440 members in August 2001; 1,554 members in December 2003); * Chapters and affiliated groups severed their ties, including some that removed the word \\"Alliance\\" from their names to avoid being associated with AQ;Neighbours Rouyn Noranda , formerly Alliance Quebec Rouyn-Noranda Chapter; \\"Regional Association of West Quebecers\\", formerly \\"The Outaouais Alliance\\" * the severity of infighting among remaining members increased, sometimes requiring intervention by the courts; * private donations ($250,000 in the mid-1990s) dropped over 90% from 1998 to 2003, with corporate donations stopping completely; * the federal government, its main sponsor (providing over 90% of AQ's annual budget), decreased funding to the group by 69% between 2000 and 2004. The first funding decrease (from $934,000 to $634,000 annually) came in 2001 after twenty anglophone groups ended their affiliation with Alliance Quebec and asked for separate government funding through the newly formed Quebec Community Groups Network. A second series of funding cuts (to $200,000 annually) came in 2003-2004 after federal government dissatisfaction with AQ's lack of spending controls and a drop in its membership and influence.Francis Scarpaleggia, MP When the Department of Canadian Heritage finally discontinued its grant in 2005 after AQ failed to produce audited financial statements,T. Peloquin, \\"Alliance Qu√©bec poursuivi pour loyer impay√©\\" (La Presse 30 June 2005) the group became insolvent and ceased activity.  Structure  Alliance Quebec was registered as a non- profit association in Quebec, with a headquarters in Montreal. Anyone could join as a member by paying a nominal fee of $5‚Äì$10. Membership entitled them to participate in the regional chapter in which they lived. Each regional chapter had its own board of directors and executive and obtained their budget mainly from membership fees. Each chapter could send nine delegates to the annual convention, which took place each May in Montreal. In the 1990s, six chapters in central Montreal merged, which allowed the merged chapter to send up to 54 delegates. (In the William Johnson era, the West Island chapter's number of delegates was increased to reflect that it was the chapter with the second-largest number of members.) A youth commission of members under thirty years of age also existed and could send up to 18 delegates to the convention. Affiliated groups such as the Townshippers' Association could also send delegates, as could affiliated universities, hospitals and community groups. The outgoing president and board of directors were also entitled to vote at the convention, representing 41 delegates. In theory, an annual convention could have nearly 400 delegates during the 1990s. In practice, the number of delegates attending annual conventions decreased over time as membership fell and affiliated groups stopped participating; the annual convention in 1985 had about 470 delegates while each of the conventions from 1999 onward had under 100 delegates. The annual convention chose the president and treasurer of AQ for the upcoming year. (In the William Johnson era, the president's term was lengthened to two years, although each subsequent president resigned before the end of their full two-year term.) The delegates would also choose the board of directors. Half of the forty-person board of directors of AQ would be up for election annually for a two-year term; the top twenty candidates who received the most votes being elected. The new board of directors would meet immediately after the convention to choose the remaining executive positions, including vice president, vice president \\"off-island\\" (meaning from outside of Montreal), secretary, and chairman of the board. The group also had an \\"Advisory Council\\" of prominent anglophones to advise the group on important issues from time to time, but this fell into disuse by the late 1990s. The executives and directors were volunteer positions (although the president received a stipend.) There were also a number of paid staff members (around two dozen in 1994),http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq24370.pdf such as a general director, a fundraiser, receptionists, researchers and organizers, paid for mainly from federal government grants. For most of its existence, AQ also maintained committees to study issues. These included (at various times)committees for health and social services, education, access to English schools, youth employment, legal affairs, communication, internal rules, and membership. Some committees organized events and activities. One of these activities, \\"Youth Employment Services\\", became independent of AQ in the 1990s and continues to operate.

Mikels (born Theodore Vincent Mikacevich; April 29, 1929 ‚Äì October 16, 2016) was an American independent filmmaker primarily of the horror cult film genre. Movies that he both produced and directed include Girl in Gold Boots (1968), The Astro-Zombies (1968), and The Doll Squad (1973). During the 1960s and 1970s, Mikels also operated his own recording label, Geneni Records, which primarily issued radio spot advertisement records used to promote his various movie projects but also released a number of stand-alone singles by such artists as Vic Lance and Little Leon Payne. Life and career Mikels was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on April 29, 1929; his father was a Croatian immigrant who worked as a meat cutter, and his mother was an herbalist who emigrated from Romania. During his grade school years, he was an amateur photographer who developed his own film in his bathtub. While in 8th grade, he was awarded his first acting role in a film that was to star William Powell, but World War II forced the cancellation of the production. By the age of 15, he was a regular stage performer and developed an interest in film-making when he attempted to shoot his performances. In 2008, he said, \\"I figured out that you have to move the camera around to get different angles, and then you have to edit the film when you're done.\\" In the 1950s, Mikels moved to Bend, Oregon, joined the Bend Community Players little theater group, and founded his own film production company.Betty L. Oakley, \\"The Torch Bearers of Bend Oregon, 1912-1978\\", Maverick Publications, Bend, Oregon, 1993, p. 49. Soon, he began producing both educational documentaries, and short dramatic features. Additionally, as horseman, archery expert, Indian and stuntman, he contributed to the production of several Hollywood films made in Central Oregon. Notably, during on location filming of The Indian Fighter, he taught studio special effects crews a technique for making flaming arrows appear authentic. Before leaving Oregon in the early 1960s, Mikels wrote and directed his first feature-length film in 1963, entitled Strike Me Deadly. Throughout the 1960s through 1980s, Mikels lived in Glendale, California out of a house he decorated as a castle. He became as well known for his hard-partying lifestyle as he did for his low budget exploitation films he'd produce and direct. He opened his first studio office with the help of actor John Houseman, and helped on many big budget Hollywood films but directing directly for a major studio constantly eluded him. Increasingly he'd shoot more of his films in the substantially cheaper Las Vegas, Nevada area and eventually moved there in the early 1990s. In 1993, Mikels began running TVM Studios, a film and video production studio based in Las Vegas. On August 28, 2005, he was presented with a Certificate of Recognition by Nevada Lieutenant Governor Lorraine T. Hunt on the day of screening of his then-latest film, Heart of a Boy, which was the only G-rated film of his career. The certificate was awarded to Mikels for his contributions to the filmmaking industry. In 2010, Mikels released the third installment in his Astro-Zombies franchise, Astro-Zombies M3: Cloned, followed two years later by Astro-Zombies M4: Invaders from Cyberspace. Both were produced by TVM Global Entertainment in association with Blue Heron International Pictures, and distributed by Alpha New Cinema. Mikels died on October 16, 2016, at the age of 87 from complications of colon cancer. DVD releases In 2007, Alpha Video released 10 of Mikels' films on DVD under the Alpha New Cinema imprint. Six of these titles included 10 Violent Women, The Doll Squad, The Corpse Grinders, The Corpse Grinders II, Girl in Gold Boots and Blood Orgy of the She-Devils, all of which Alpha later released as a six- DVD set titled Ted V.

The first was published by Ace Books, and the others by DAW Books. According to a legend, Avalon is the place where King Arthur was taken when he was dying. In Avalon, Earth is a place of legend, separated from Avalon by a dimensional gateway, and what is legend in one place is real in another. In Kar Kaballa, Dylan MacBride, the son of a famous Avalonian explorer, attempts to warn the Empire in which he lives (fairly similar to the late-19th century British Empire) of an impending invasion by the Gogs. The Gogs are a nomadic race equivalent to the Mongols, living on a continent separated from Avalon by a narrow sea. Their ruler is Kar Kaballa, and they worship a deity named Cythraul who demands human sacrifice and wishes to emerge and consume the world. MacBride's attempts are unsuccessful because the Empire assumes the Gogs cannot cross the sea barrier that separates the continents and, in any case, the Navy would stop them. MacBride's explanations that the sea barrier that separates the continents freezes over once every fifty years and that the freeze is due to happen again, giving the Gogs ready access to Avalon and making the Navy powerless to stop them, are ignored. Thus, the 19th-century-equivalent culture must contend anachronistically with an invasion of a barbarian horde similar to that of Attila the Hun or Genghis Khan (but armed with formidable, advanced weaponry). The nomads being named \\"Gogs\\" obviously links their invasion with the apocalyptic visions of Gog and Magog, derived from Jewish Eschatology and taken up by other religions as well. MacBride must team with a naval officer, a visitor from Earth who is trying to sell a new weapon called a Gatling gun to the Imperial authorities, and Clarinda McTague, an appealing sorceress who worships the goddess Keridwen, in an attempt to stop the Gogs and prevent Cythraul from emerging from his underground lair and consuming the world. It's a serio-comic story, combining the \\"Yellow Peril\\" threat popular in old novels, a Great Old One as per Lovecraft, and elements of Celtic mythology. The Second War of the Worlds is a sequel to Kar Kaballa in which Wells' Martian invaders (from War of the Worlds) have taken a step sideways to Thor (the Anwwn-equivalent of Mars) to attempt the invasion of Anwwn. There are primitive submarines, dirigibles, and Old Souls involved, and the Martians are once again defeated. Two men from Earth, Mr. H and Dr. W, assist MacBride defeat the Martians; the story makes it clear that these characters are obviously Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. The Island Snatchers is the third Dylan McBride book, and features Gaelic gods stealing the island from which Clarinda (now Mrs. McBride) hails, and the McBrides' efforts to get the island back. Druid's World is a variant of Kar Kaballa, featuring a protagonist named Adam MacBride, but again set in an \\"Avalon\\" which combined features of 19th century England (although the naval mutinies are similar to those of the Napoleonic Wars, the Spithead Mutiny in particular) with features of the 5th or 6th century Byzantine Empire. Other works Quite different is Smith's nuclear war novel Doomsday Wing. It shares many plot elements with the more famous film Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, but with reversed allegiances -- where the film depicted a fanatic anti-Communist American general initiating an attack on the Soviet Union on his own initiative, in the Smith novel there is a fanatic Russian Communist attacking America without any authorization. Smith's soft-core erotic novel, The Coming of the Rats (vt, Virgin Mistress) begins just before atomic bombs hit the United States and becomes a survivalist novel where the hero and his mates fight mutated rats. The soft-core erotic \\"St. Germain\\" and \\"Jake Reynolds\\" series (along with others of his oeuvre) use witchcraft and black magic elements for putative fantasy, but remain mainstream works.

The station, which is owned by Robert and Ashley Stevens through licensee Broadcast Communications, Inc., broadcasts at a clear-channel frequency of 810 kHz with a power level of 1,000 watts. The city of license for the station is McKeesport, Pennsylvania. The station maintains its studios and offices on Lincoln Way in White Oak, Pennsylvania. Because WEDO shares the same frequency as \\"clear channel\\" station WGY in Schenectady, New York; it broadcasts only during the daytime hours. On Tuesday, September 15, 2015, it was announced that 810 Inc. agreed to sell WEDO to Broadcast Communications, Inc. of Irwin, Pennsylvania, licensee of WKFB, WKHB, WANB, WKVE and three FM translators in the Pittsburgh market, plus other broadcast properties in the Cumberland, Maryland market. The sale was finalized on January 5, 2016, at a purchase price of $175,000. History and programming background Studio and offices in White Oak, Pennsylvania The station's programming offerings consist of various Catholic, ethnic, oldies, and paid programs, not much different from when it first signed on the air back in 1947, at around the same time as another McKeesport-licensed radio station, WMCK AM 1360. Among the programming aired includes a local oldies show at noon on weekdays, an Irish show on Sunday afternoons and a live traditional Latin Rite Mass from an SSPX chapel at 10 a.m. on Sunday morning. WEDO has had only this call sign, and only two owners in its six-decade history. Tri-City Broadcasting first put the station on the air and operated it until 1972, when it was purchased by 810, Inc., a wholly owned company headed by local entrepreneurs Ralph and Judith Baron. Following the death of Ralph Baron, Judy Baron, now residing in Florida, has recently established a trust that would control the station in the event of her death or incapacitation. During the 60s and 70s, WEDO became known for its Top 40 music presentation and even received more notoriety when they relocated their studios and offices inside Midtown Plaza Mall on Fifth Avenue in downtown McKeesport during the 1970s. The mall, one of the first in suburban Pittsburgh, enabled shoppers to watch the DJ's in real time as they did their on-air shifts. In the early 1980s, when FM emerged as the leading technology for music, WEDO gradually dropped its music for the program-oriented format that it originally had in its formative years. As McKeesport's downtown economy continued to deteriorate, so did tenant business in Midtown Plaza Mall, as many of the stores went out of business or relocated into the suburbs. With few tenants left in the building, the property's managers turned off heat to several areas of the mall in an effort to reduce operating costs. A heating problem one day in 2000 resulted in a frozen pipe bursting in the mall and leaving the radio station in about two inches of standing water. According to a former employee, it was the second time that such an incident occurred. Management then decided to relocate to a different building. WEDO cleared its equipment and furniture out of the mall weeks later and moved to its current location at a former bank location at 1985 Lincoln Way, where it occupies the second floor. WEDO in the news In the spring of 1999, WEDO was the victim of a not-so-innocent and dangerous prank committed by local high school students at its transmitter facility in Forest Hills, as explained in the April 13th and 29th, 1999 issue archives of the Tribune-Review... WEDO people John James managed the station from June 1982 until retiring in 2014. James' predecessor, David Leiner took over for longtime manager John Longo in 1980. Longo went on to own and operate WCNS, about east of Pittsburgh until his retirement in 2014. Jeremy Bosse manages the station today.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). WPXC-TV's studios are located on Blythe Island Highway/State Route 303 in southwestern Brunswick, and its transmitter is located in unincorporated southwestern Camden County, Georgia (northwest of Kingsland). On cable, the station is available on Comcast Xfinity channel 12 (NBC affiliate WTLV, which broadcasts over the air on virtual channel 12, is carried on cable channel 11) and in high definition on digital channel 438. History The station was granted a construction permit by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on December 28, 1987. The station first signed on the air on April 2, 1990 as WBSG-TV. Originally operating as an independent station, the station became a charter affiliate of The WB upon its launch on January 11, 1995. However, WBSG struggled financially, and on August 2, 1996, the station's owner, Coastal Com Inc., entered into a local marketing agreement with the Allbritton Communications Company, set to take effect on September 1; Coastal Com had earlier planned to sell WBSG to Allbritton outright for $10 million. Allbritton was planning to sign on Orange Park-licensed WJXX (channel 25), and intended for WBSG to serve as a semi-satellite of WJXX for the northern part of the market. Allbritton had also signed an agreement to switch the affiliations of its television stations not already affiliated with the network to ABC; this agreement was spurred by a 1994 affiliation deal between Fox and New World Communications (which was the owner of Birmingham ABC affiliate WBRC at the time). WJXX signed on the air on February 9, 1997, taking the ABC affiliation from WJKS (channel 17, now CW affiliate WCWJ). On that same day, WBSG dropped the WB affiliation and began carrying most of WJXX's schedule with deviations for channel 21's own local newscasts. The switch was supposed to occur in April 1997. However, when WJKS announced that it would drop the ABC affiliation in February and join The WB, under the callsign WJWB, ABC asked Allbritton to sign on WJXX two months earlier than originally planned. Allbritton heavily invested in the two stations, including building studio facilities on A.C. Skinner Parkway in Jacksonville. However, WBSG and WJXX failed to gain significant ratings traction in the market. In addition to the early sign-on, the two stations' combined signal footprint was not nearly as large as those of CBS affiliate WJXT (channel 4, now an independent station) and NBC affiliate WTLV (channel 12). After the FCC legalized television station duopolies on November 15, 1999, Allbritton announced the following day that it would sell WJXX to the Gannett Company, owner of WTLV. WBSG was not included in the sale. When the sale of WJXX to Gannett was finalized in March 2000, Allbritton made WBSG an affiliate of Pax (a forerunner to Ion Television). The network's parent company, Paxson Communications (now Ion Media Networks), bought the station that September, and changed its call letters to WPXC-TV the following year, to reflect the station's new affiliation. =Former translator (WPXJ-LP)= Until September 6, 2013, WPXC-TV was relayed on a low power fill-in analog translator station, WPXJ-LP (channel 41) in Jacksonville. This station was granted a construction permit to operate on UHF channel 59 on November 12, 1986, under the callsign W59BC. A license to cover was issued on July 29, 1988. The station applied to move to UHF channel 41 and became W41BM in 1992. Although the FCC regarded the station as having immediately changed callsigns, the move was not licensed until 1996; a few months later, the station was renamed WDVL-LP. WDVL was silent by December 1997, when Paxson Communications purchased the station from original owner Jacksonville Translator, Inc. It returned to the air in April 1998 as WPXJ-LP, temporarily carrying programming from Paxson's infomercial network, the Infomail TV Network (inTV) until the launch of Pax TV on August 31. WPXJ was the only Pax station in the market until WBSG-TV's switch to the network and its subsequent acquisition by Paxson in 2000. The station had a construction permit to flash-cut a digital signal into operation on UHF channel 41, which was never constructed.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1307503&Service;=LD&Form;_id=346&Facility;_id=29716 WPXJ-LP left the air on September 6, 2013 due to the expiration of the lease for its transmitter site; on September 9, 2014, its license was canceled by the FCC.

Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display WPXC-TV's virtual channel as 21. Newscasts During its years as an independent station and later as a WB affiliate, WBSG-TV operated a news department; its local newscasts, branded as NewsCenter 21 with half-hour evening newscasts at 6:00, 10:00 and 11:00 p.m., were targeted at Brunswick and southeast Georgia. After it switched to ABC in December 1996, the station cancelled its 10:00 p.m. newscast as the network began running regular primetime programming during that hour. The news department was shut down in December 1997, when WJXX launched its own news operation and Allbritton transferred most of WBSG's news staff to WJXX (during the stations' first months as an ABC affiliate, the two stations split their simulcast at 6:00 and 11:00 p.m., with WBSG continuing its local newscasts while WJXX aired M*A*S*H reruns). =On-air staff=Notable former on-air staff * Jacque Reid - reporter (later with CNN and BET) * Lacey Johnson Leonardi - reporters =Sports programming= During the 2008 season, WPXC aired Major League Baseball games from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays produced by the team's syndication service, the Rays Television Network.

The station is owned by Laurel Highland Total Communications, Inc., through licensee LHTC Media, Inc., also licensee of WCNS radio in Latrobe. WXJX broadcasts on 910 kHz with a maximum power output of 5,000 watts daytime and 69 watts nighttime. It is licensed to the borough of Apollo, Pennsylvania. The station, as WAVL after a long history of religious radio broadcasting, became a secular broadcaster in December 2015 with a Variety Hits format. As of Monday, August 29, 2016, WAVL adopted a conservative talk format. HistoryEarly years= The construction permit for this radio station was first issued on February 1, 1947. The station's original assigned frequency was 890 kHz and power output at 250 watts daytime. The FCC allowed the change in May 1947. WAVL first signed on the air April 15, 1947. For many years, this station operated as a 1,000 watt, non-directional, daytime-only station. After being denied an STA to broadcast high school football games in 1948, ownership applied for permission to operate at 100 watts during the night in 1949, but that was denied in 1951 following a hearing on the matter. However, in 1968, WAVL was granted pre- sunrise authorization of 350 watts, which allowed it to sign on daily at 6:00am year-round. In 1978, then-owner Tri-Borough Broadcasting raised a second tower, adopted a directional antenna pattern, and increased its power to 5,000 watts, but still retained its daytime-only status. WAVL was granted permission to operate at a limited nighttime power of 69 watts in the late 1990s. For much of its existence, WAVL was a conservative Christian radio station, broadcasting inspirational music and time-brokered sermons from its studios located with its transmitter site in the Kiskiminetas Township village of Orchard Hills, just on the outskirts of Apollo, its city of license. WAVL was also the very first radio station in Armstrong County, with WACB (now WTYM) coming on the air the following year. For a time at the beginning, WAVL maintained studios and offices at the corner of Fourth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue in downtown Apollo, until they were destroyed by a fire in 1956. WAVL was founded by Andrew J. West and the Reverend Cecil F. Clifton, a deeply patriotic minister who started the station on the principle of \\"serving God and Country by guarding America's spiritual heritage\\". The station remained in Clifton's family for more than 50 years, doing business as Tri-Borough Broadcasting (referring to Apollo, Vandergrift, and Leechburg, which was also the origins of the station call letters). The station is also speculated to have been among the very first in the nation to begin the practice of brokering its airtime to ministries and other faith-based organizations, including one of the first in the nation to broadcast Messianic Jewish programming with the Rabbi Sloan talk-teaching broadcast called \\"Shema Israel\\" in the mid 1990s. The station also broadcast local news weekday mornings in between the time-brokered programs for many years, anchored by the soft- spoken, deep-baritoned genial Carman Tubby, who was a favorite in the community for many years until his death on September 14, 2000 , and became best known for addressing his listeners on the air as \\"friends\\". Tubby had worked at WAVL since its inception and retired seven months prior to his death, concluding almost 54 years of service. After Reverend Clifton's death in 1990, the station passed to his wife Alice. Their son-in-law, Reverend Robert Dain, had served as the station's General Manager years before that. At the beginning of the 21st century, following Mrs. Clifton's death, WAVL was put up for sale. =Clifton dynasty ends= WAVL was purchased in 2001 for $400,000 by Evangel Heights Assembly of God, a church in Sarver, Pennsylvania; located at Routes 356 and 28 in southern Butler County. Wishing to move WAVL towards a younger audience, Evangel Heights decided to change the station's format to contemporary Christian, gradually phasing out the ministries, and adopting the moniker \\"Praise 910\\". The station first broadcast with a live, local airstaff during the daytime hours, then switching to satellite based programming at night, with modest success. In 2007, Evangel Heights replaced all local air staff with satellite programming full-time, and moved studios to the church on Beale Road in Buffalo Township. Evangel Heights in 2009 launched a conservative all-talk satellite-delivered format under the \\"Liberty 910\\" banner, with some brokered ministry programming in limited numbers. =Second sale= The two-antenna directional array, seen from Kings Road, looking north In August 2013, WAVL was under agreement to be sold to Kittanning-based Family-Life Media-Com Inc., owner of WTYM and a low-power Christian-formatted television station, with the station being operated under an LMA until details of the sale could be finalized. Coincidentally, Family Life Media-Com President David Croyle, once worked for WAVL under Tri-Borough Broadcasting's ownership. The station's studios were returned to its transmitter facility following the LMA, but most business was conducted from Family Life's headquarters in Kittanning. The station was taken back to its roots of music and ministry since Family Life Media-Com's assumption of operations, with a mix of local and national shows plus featured live broadcasts from the Family Life Studios in Kittanning. As of July 31, 2015, control reverted to Evangel Heights Assembly of God Church due to both sides being unable to work out an amicable agreement on the sale of the station. The church elected to take WAVL silent for staffing reasons and filed a Special Temporary Authority application with the FCC allowing the station to remain silent for a six-month period. On Wednesday, December 30, 2015, it was reported and subsequently confirmed that WAVL was back on the air. The station operated under a lease agreement between Evangel Heights Assembly of God Church and the Colonial Radio Group (now known as Andrulonis Media) until the FCC approved the asset purchase agreement on Friday, April 29, 2016. =Third sale= On Monday, June 20, 2016, Allaccess.com reported that WAVL was being sold to Laurel Highland Total Communications, the licensee of WCNS in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. The $301.500 transaction included the sale of WAVL and an FM translator in Olean, New York under application to be moved to Latrobe. The sale was consummated on November 15, 2016. =WAVL today= The station had broadcast \\"The Mountain\\" format, a variety music format used by other Colonial stations, from December 2015 to July 2016. On July 1, 2016 WAVL went silent. Colonial Media, in an application dated July 5, 2016, requested Special Temporary Authority for WAVL to go silent while technical repairs and renovations were being made at the studio and transmitter site in Kiski Township prior to the transfer of the station from Colonial Media and Entertainment to new owners Laurel Highland Total Communications. On August 29, 2016, WAVL returned to the air simulcasting the programming of future sister station WCNS, until a local studio and office presence is established. The simulcast ended in late 2017, as WCNS flipped to music and WAVL kept the talk format. =WXJX= On December 20, 2018, the station changed its call sign to WXJX. On December 28, 2018, WXJX dropped the talk format and began stunting with a four-song loop towards a \\"Jack FM\\" format to launch on December 31.Jack on the Way to Latrobe Radioinsight - December 28, 2018 Previous logo 200px References *Asset Purchase Agreement *Christian Radio Station Off the Air While on Market *Apollo Radio Station WAVL AM 910 to Return to Religious Roots *FCC History Cards - WXJX External links * * XJX (AM) Category:Radio stations established in 1948 Category:1948 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Adult hits radio stations in the United States ","title":"WXJX (AM)"},{"id":"2742123","text":"The Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction, the educational arm of the Women‚Äôs Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), was an important part of the temperance movement and played a significant role in generating support for prohibition of alcohol in the U.S. Background Calls for alcohol education were heard as early as 1869, when temperance writer Julia Coleman addressed the Fulton County (NY) Teachers' Institute on the subject. Similar appeals were made by others over the next few years. In 1873 the National Temperance Society called for instruction in public and private schools on the effects of alcohol on the human system. At about the same time, Mary Hunt, a former school teacher persuaded her local school board in Massachusetts to establish temperance instruction in its schools. Then, together with Julia Coleman, Hunt extended the campaign to other school districts in the state. In 1879, Hunt addressed the WCTU's national convention on the subject of \\"Scientific Temperance Instruction,\\" in which she argued for \\"thorough text-book study of Scientific Temperance in public schools as a preventive against intemperance.\\" The following year the Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction in Schools and Colleges, with Hunt as National Superintendent, was established. After experiencing some missteps in her campaign to bring about temperance instruction by persuading local school boards to have it taught, Hunt developed the strategy of having WCTU members pressure state legislators to mandate temperance instruction and to promote the nomination and candidacy of pro-temperance candidates in election years. Her highly organized members campaigned for temperance candidates, developed letter writing campaigns, obtained temperance endorsements from leading citizens, presented legislators with petitions, and packed open hearings on proposed bills. The technique was effective. By the turn of the 20th century, the Scientific Temperance Instruction movement directed by Hunt had proved to be highly successful. Virtually every state, the District of Columbia, and all United States possessions had strong legislation mandating that all students receive anti- alcohol education. The implementation of this legislation was closely monitored down to the classroom level by legions of determined and vigilant WCTU members throughout the nation. The WCTU promoted compulsory temperance education so as to create \\"trained haters of alcohol to pour a whole Niagara of ballots upon the saloon.\\" To this end Hunt required that textbooks which she approved \\"teach that alcohol is a dangerous and seductive poison; that fermentation turns beer and wine and cider from a food into poison; that a little liquor creates by its nature the appetite for more; and that degradation and crime result from alcohol.\\" Publishers had difficulty selling textbooks that were not approved by Mary Hunt; therefore, they closely followed her guidelines for content. Hunt shared the common temperance belief that drinking in moderation was undesirable. Therefore, books which she approved asserted that \\"To attempt to drink fermented liquors moderately has led to the hopeless ruin of untold thousands\\" and \\"It is the nature of alcohol to make drunkards.\\" Central to Hunt‚Äôs approval was the absolute insistence that alcohol in any form and in any amount was a poison to the human system. By the mid-1890s, the content of textbooks endorsed by the WCTU were increasingly criticized by leading scientists and educators. The Committee of Fifty for the Study of the Liquor Problem investigated the nature of alcohol education promoted by Mary Hunt and the Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction. The committee believed that instruction should be based on facts so that students could form their own educated opinions. They \\"should not be taught that the drinking of a glass or two of wine by a grown-up person is very dangerous.\\" This was diametrically opposed to the beliefs of Hunt, who referred to the enormous \\"harvest of death that might result from the universal teaching that the drinking of one or two glasses of wine is not 'very dangerous'\\" and asserted that \\"such teaching would be nothing less than crime.\\" After extensive investigation, the Committee of Fifty concluded that \\"under the name of 'Scientific Temperance Instruction' there has been grafted upon the public school system of nearly all our States an educational scheme relating to alcohol which is neither scientific, nor temperate, nor instructive.\\" Hunt prepared a Reply in which she charged the Committee with being prejudiced against abstinence instruction, accused it of grossly misrepresenting facts, and insisted that the WCTU-endorsed textbooks were completely accurate. She then had the Reply entered into the Congressional Record and distributed more than 100,000 copies. When national prohibition went into effect in 1920, the WCTU actually promoted its temperance education efforts with even greater fervor to protect its hard-won gain. However, the repeal of prohibition in 1933 signaled the beginning of the end for scientific temperance instruction. In states and counties that chose to remain \\"dry\\" (maintain prohibition), students tended to continue receiving temperance instruction. The WCTU helped to ensure that temperance textbooks were available to meet the declining demand. Further reading * Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

It was found in Kachin state, Myanmar. The species can be assigned to one of the modern families, the Peripatidae. While only five leg pairs can be discerned, the information gained from the fossil is enough to preclude assignment to any known modern genus. Cretoperipatus burmiticus is important in closing a gap between the only other known fossil onychophores, Helenodora inopinata from the Carboniferous and Succinipatopsis balticus plus Tertiapatus dominicanus from the Eocene and Miocene, respectively. It was hypothesised that onychophorans could have migrated from Gondwana to Southeast Asia via the northwards drift of India. Research published in 2016 concluded that the age of Burmese amber supports an earlier migration through Europe. The same study also came to the conclusion that Typhloperipatus williamsoni is the closest extant relative of Cretoperipatus.

Hinduism has a long tradition and is the oldest religion in Sri Lanka. More than 2,000 years civilization have proved so far from Hindu temples in Sri Lanka. , Hindus make up 12.60% of the Sri Lankan population, and are almost exclusively Tamils apart from small immigrant communities from India and Pakistan such as the Sindhis, Telugus and Malayalees. In the 1915 census they made up almost 25% of the population, which included the indentured labourers the British had brought. Despite emigration today they are still a sizeable minority. Hinduism is dominant in the North and Eastern provinces, where there are predominantly Tamil people. Hinduism is also practised in the central regions (where there are significant numbers of people of Indian Tamil descent) as well as in the capital, Colombo. According to the government census of 2011, there are 2,554,606 Hindus in Sri Lanka constituting 12.6% of the country's population. During the Sri Lankan Civil War, many Tamils fled to other countries. There are Hindu temples abroad which were built by the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora to maintain their religion, tradition and culture. The majority of Sri Lankan Hindus follow the teaching of Shaiva Siddhanta. Some Hindus follow Shaktism. Sri Lanka is home to the five abodes of Shiva, which are known as Pancha Ishwarams, the holy places built by king Ravana. Sri Murugan is one of the most popular Hindu deities in Sri Lanka. He is not only venerated by the Hindu Tamils but also by Buddhist Sinhalese and aboriginal Veddas.Walking to Kataragama, Sunil Goonasekera, International Centre for Ethnic Studies, 2007, p. 520. A significant Hindu religious figure in Sri Lankan modern history is Satguru Siva Yogaswami of Jaffna. One of the mystics of the 20th century, Yogaswami was the official satguru and counseling sage of Lanka's several million Tamil Hindu population. The Ramakrishna Mission is somewhat active in the Amparai and Batticaloa districts while the Shaiva Siddhanta school of philosophy of Shaivism sect of Hinduism is prevalent in the North of Sri Lanka. Yogaswami belonged to the Shaiva Siddhanta and he was 161st head of the Nandinatha Sampradaya. The next person in the line of succession after Yogaswami was Sivaya Subramuniyaswami. Theological origins Statue of Ravana at Koneswaram Temple. According to legend, Sri Lanka was formed when sage Narada persuaded the God of Wind and Air, Vayu, to humble his close friend, Mount Meru (a huge mountain where the gods lived). Vayu then spent the next year blowing strong winds at the mountain, which was shielded by Garuda, a mythical bird. When Garuda took respite for a while, Vayu caused part of the apex of the mountain to fall into the sea, forming the island of Sri Lanka. The first major Hindu reference to Sri Lanka is found in the great Hindu epic, the Ramayana. The Ramayana tells that Sri Lanka was ruled by Yaksha king Kubera. The throne of Lanka was usurped by his half-brother Ravana. Ravana was the main villain in the Ramayana and was killed by Rama the avatar of Vishnu. The Ramayana also mentions a bridge between India and Sri Lanka, known as Rama's Bridge, constructed with rocks by Rama with the help of Hanuman and others. Many believers view the sand bar islands connecting Sri Lanka to India as the remains of the bridge as seen in satellite images. Archeological evidence is also found to support worship of Lord Siva in parts of Sri Lanka, from pre- historic times, prior to the arrival of Prince Vijaya. Even Ravana was a devout follower of Lord Siva.The Book of Shiva, Namita Gokhale, Penguin Books India, 2009, p. 104. Historic roots Nainativu Nagapooshani Amman Temple Evidence states the earliest inhabitants of the island were the Nagas and Yakkas. The Nagas practiced an early form of Hinduism that worshipped Lord Shiva and serpents. This form of animistic Shaivism is common in Tamil Nadu and other parts of India. The Nagas who inhabited the Jaffna Peninsula were probably the ancestors of Sri Lankan Tamils. The Nagas started to assimilate to Tamil language and culture in the 3rd century BCE, and lost their separate identity. The Nainativu Nagapooshani Amman Temple in Nainativu is believed to be one of the prominent 64 Shakti Peethams. templepurohit.com - May 28, 2015 Hinduism was probably the dominant religion in Sri Lanka before the arrival of Buddhism in the 3rd century BC. Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka by Mahinda, the son of the Emperor Ashoka, during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa.Asian Religions in British Columbia, UBC Press 2011, p. 125. The Sinhalese embraced Buddhism and Tamils remain Hindus in Sri Lanka. However it was activity from across the Palk Strait that truly set the scene for Hinduism's survival in Sri Lanka. Shaivism (devotional worship of Lord Shiva) was the dominant branch practiced by the Tamil peoples, thus most of the traditional Hindu temple architecture and philosophy of Sri Lanka drew heavily from this particular strand of Hinduism. Thirugnanasambanthar mentioned the names of a number of Sri Lankan Hindu temples in his works.Lecture on Hindu sculpture and architecture of Sri Lanka Sunday Times - September 29, 2010 European invasion The arrival of European colonialists brought profound consequences to both Hindu and Buddhist communities. In 1505, a Portuguese fleet, under the command of Captain‚Äìmajor Don Louren√ßo de Almeida, arrived off the coast of Sri Lanka. Eventually deals were struck between rival native rulers and the Portuguese. Formal treaties between the two groups thereby heralded the entry of the alien forces in the political arena of Sri Lanka. Eventually over time, the Europeans were able to take advantage of the fractured nature of Sri Lankan politics, eventually culminating in successful military wins against the rebellious natives, most notably against the Hindu Tamils in the North, whose leaders were made to swear allegiance to the king of Portugal in return for maintaining their distinct laws and customs. However, any so-called rulers had merely become puppets of their European overlords until in the end, further rebellion caused the Tamil Jaffna Kingdom to fall in the hands of the Portuguese in June 1619, when the incumbent ruler and his family were arrested and taken prisoner. According to the Portuguese administrative arrangements, the jurisdiction of Jaffna came directly under the Viceroy at Goa. In Goa, the deposed ruler was tried for high treason by the Portuguese High Court (Relaco), found him guilty of all charges leveled against him by the Europeans and the ruler was sentenced to death. Ultimately, the last Tamil Hindu king of the Jaffna Kingdom (1215 to 1619) was hanged in the year 1621. Conversion attempts While attempting to control their newly-won lands in Asia, the Portuguese were also actively encouraging Hindu Tamils to convert to Catholicism. Force conversion was also practiced. In 1618 AD, following some serious Tamil revolts, the Council of the Jesuit Society had resolved that those Tamils who converted to Christianity would be spared death. Others encouraged to embrace the Catholic creed included the wives and children of murdered Tamil leaders. Tellingly, the surviving three children of the executed Tamil King of Jaffna, had been converted to Catholicism when young and were later sent to Portugal for their studies. The eldest of these children officially signed a declaration form handing over full control of Jaffna to the King of Portugal . This officially ended Tamil sovereignty, in Sri Lanka which began as an invasion in 1215, and permitted Catholic conversion activity in those formerly Tamil areas. The result of these actions explain why there are Tamil Catholics to be found today in Jaffna and surrounding parts. Portuguese were marginally more successful in converting numerically more Tamils of the coastal regions of both Sri Lanka and India, as they were able to intercede on behalf of these fishing communities against the machinations of the Muslim merchant guilds who had monopolized pearling and other trading activities till then. By eliminating the Muslim middlemen, the Portuguese won the loyalty of these people. But further inland their attempts would yield only minimal results. During the British colonial period a large scale attempt to convert Tamil Hindus to Christianity by American Baptist and Presbyterian missionaries, along with British Methodist and Anglican missionaries, was attempted via building schools and hospices. Again they were only marginally successful. Conversion attempts today through missionary activity of various Muslim branches, Christian denominations and the Bah√° º√≠ Faith is still ongoing. Religious groups that came to provide aid to stricken civilians during the 1983 to 2009 Sri Lankan Civil War, and after the devastating 2004 tsunami, have given further impetus to these efforts. In 2017,Catholics attacked Hindu temple and households at Vellankulam in Mannar to convert the Hindus to Christianity.https://hinduexistence.org/2017/05/02/hindu-temple-destroyed-and- households-attacked-in-mannar-sri-lanka-by-christians/ In 2018,200 Christians led by Fr. Desman attacked Hindus; beat them with sticks when Hindus started to build temple on the land reserved for them .https://www.hindujagruti.org/news/114818.html Philosophical roots The elite and the upper classes, consisting of the higher castes, amongst the Tamils adhere to what is known as the Saiva Siddhanta or Dvaita school of Shaivism. Sidanta is opposed to the mainstream Vedanta school of India. Adherents of various Dvaita schools both amongst the majority Vaishnavites and minority Shaivites can be seen across India. But amongst Sri Lankan Hindus, it is the Dvaita Siddhanta school of thought that commands elite loyalty. Dvaita Saiva Siddhanta school differentiates between the soul, god and actions or Karma as opposed to the unity of the soul and god as expounded by the Vedanta school. Most elite temples follow what is known as Agamic rituals which are highly Sanskritized rituals along with usage of Tamil hymns by specialized singers known as Ootuvar. Most other Sri Lankan Hindus follow what is commonly known as folk Hinduism without the baggage of philosophical school of thought They usually worship a village, clan or tribal deity within or outside the accepted pantheon of Hindu deities. Some local deities are Kannaki, Mariamman, Draupadi, Ayyanar, Vairavar and worship of weapons such as Vel or the lance. The Vel festival is also a highly anticipated event in Sri Lanka. They might worship it in a formal temple structure, forest grove or an open plain. They might or might not use the help of Brahmin priests. The Vel Chariot makes its way through Nuwara eliya town in Sri Lanka. Localized rituals are employed but share common features across India, specifically South India. Some such rituals are Kavadi Attam or penance dancing, Tee Midi or fire walking , trance due to possession by local gods and animal sacrifices to appease local gods or spirits. Religion is a compulsory subject in Sri Lankan schools and Hindu students can choose from either Hinduism or Saiva Siddhanta as a compulsory subject from Grade 1 to Grade 11. Sri Lankan Tamils mostly study Saiva Siddhanta while upcountry Tamils mostly study Hinduism. Social reformers & religious teachers As a reaction as well as an effort to arrest the conversion efforts of missionaries, there arose many religious reformers that wanted to modify the existing Hindu practices to be more able to stand up to western Christian critique. A few of them are prominent, such as Arumuka Navalar and Vipulananda Adigal. Amongst religious teachers or gurus, Kaddai Swami, Kaddai Swami's Shishya Chellappaswami and Chellappaswami's Shishya Jnana guru Siva Yogaswami stand out whose direct sannyasin sishya, Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, founded Saiva Siddhanta Church in Hawaii in the United States.Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami was sishya of Yogaswami. Sri Lankan Hindu temples Shiva statue at Koneswaram temple. Front entrance of Nallur Kandaswamy temple As most prominent Hindu places of worship were concentrated on the coastal areas, all were destroyed by the Portuguese zealots during the post 1505 AD colonial era. Hindus in Sri Lanka believe that the island once had 5 prominent temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. The Pancha Ishwarams *Naguleswaram in the North *Ketheeswaram in the North West *Koneswaram in the East *Muneswaram in the West and *Tondeswaram in the South. All were destroyed by the Portuguese during the colonial period. Of these apart from the temple in the South all have been rebuilt during the British or post independent era. Apart from these temples there are other prominent temples such as the newly constructed Ponnabalvaneswarm temple in the capital Colombo, the ancient Nainativu Nagapooshani Amman Kovil and the Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil constructed in Jaffna during the medieval period that are still important to current day Hindus. There are also places of worship and temples that are sacred to both Buddhists and Hindus in Sri Lanka. The prominent one is Katirkamam also known as Kataragama temple dedicated to Lord Murukan or Skanda. Also Adam's Peak, a mountain top that is also known as Sri Pada to the Buddhists and Sivanolipada Malai to the Hindus. Civil conflict and exodus In the long term, as a dwindling minority, the future could appear uncertain for the survival of a community after almost 2,500 years of varying degrees of presence in Sri Lanka. The Tamils of recent Indian origin, in the plantations, which constitute over half of the Hindu population in Sri Lanka continue to exist, unaffected by the consequences of the civil war. The prohibition of naval travel between Sri Lanka and India has isolated Sri Lankan Hindus from their Indian neighbours. Demographics Distribution of Hinduism in Sri Lanka (2001) According to the 1981 census, there were 2,297,800 Hindus in Sri Lanka. The 2012 census reported 2,554,606 Hindus in all of Sri Lanka. This was 12.6% down from 15.48% in 1981 largely on account of immigration. 20,000 people died during the 2004 tsunami in LTTE held areas alone. In 1981 close to 85% of all Tamils were Hindus. Hindus constitute the overwhelming majority of Tamils in Sri Lanka. However, in the district of Mannar, Christians slightly outnumber Hindus. The highest proportion of Hindus is found in Eastern Sri Lanka (close to 91% of all Tamils, with 92% in Amparai and Batticaloa and 87% in Trincomallee). In the Central Province also the proportion of Hindus is more than 90% of the Tamil population. (91% each in Matale and Nuwara Eliya and 88% in Kandy). In Uva province the proportion of Hindus is 91.3% of the Tamil population. However, in 1981 93.15% of Uva Tamils were Hindu. In Northern Province 84% of all Tamils were Hindus (90% in Vavuniya, 87% in Jaffna and Mullaitivu and 42% in Mannar).

She was the winner of the U.S. women's first individual event gold medal in Olympic history. Career McNamara won the 1980 US all-around title and qualified for the 1980 Olympic team but did not compete due to the Olympic Committee's boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Russia. As consolation, she was one of 461 athletes to receive a Congressional Gold Medal many years later. A year later, at the World Championships that were coincidentally also held in Moscow, McNamara notched the top U.S. women's world all-around finish (seventh place) at that point in history. She also earned a bronze medal on bars, a seventh on floor and finished fifth on beam. She had entered the beam final in first place but went overtime in the final. At the 1982 World Cup, McNamara fell off the bars to place eighth all-around. In finals, however, she earned a bronze on vault and a seventh place on beam. At the 1983 world championships, she finished 16th all-around, sixth on vault, and seventh on uneven bars. In 1982, The Flower Council of Holland, headed by namesake Dutch Queen Juliana, christened the Julianne McNamara rose. At the time, the only other American woman to be so honored was the then U.S. First Lady Nancy Reagan. The climax of McNamara's athletic career was at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. There, she tied Ma Yanhong from China for first on the uneven bars (both gymnasts scored 10.00), won the silver on floor, and placed fourth all-around. =Eponymous Skills= Uneven Bars: Jump to clear support ‚Äì clear hip circle with half turn (mount; D). Retirement Although the 1984 Olympics was her last formal competition, McNamara did not retire officially until 1987. Her international accomplishments are considered to have played a major role in spotlighting the U.S. women's team in the early 1980s.

The character was initially known as the second Spider-Woman, later as the second Arachne, and then as the second Madame Web. The character first appeared in Secret Wars vol. 1 #6 (in the shadows). In 2012, Julia Carpenter was listed as #47 on IGN's \\"Top 50 Avengers\\". Publication history As Spider-Woman, Carpenter has appeared as a starring character in Avengers West Coast and Force Works as well as a supporting character in the third Spider-Woman series, whose main character was Mattie Franklin. While she frequently appears as a member of a team, such as the Avengers West Coast and Force Works, Julia starred in her own four-part Spider-Woman miniseries which explained her origin and the origin of her enemies, Death Web. Fictional character biography A secretive government group called The Commission decided to create their own superhero. Val Cooper met college friend Julia Carpenter in Julia's hometown of Denver, and convinced her to be part of an \\"athletic study.\\" She was unknowingly a test subject in their experiments. During the experiment, they \\"accidentally\\" injected Julia with a mix of spider venom and exotic plant extracts, which gave Julia powers very similar to those of Spider-Man.Spider-Woman Volume 2 #2 Not long after she was given the identity of Spider-Woman, she was drawn into the first Secret Wars, where she met Spider-Man and the Avengers for the first time, and allied herself with the superhuman champions. She battled the Absorbing Man, Doctor Doom, and the Hulk. She was killed and resurrected by Doom with the power of the Beyonder.Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #6‚Äì12 After returning to Earth, Julia joined Freedom Force (a government-sponsored super team made up primarily of former members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants who enlisted into government service to avoid prison terms). In an early mission with Freedom Force, the team was sent to arrest the X-Men. During this conflict with the X-Men, Julia also began to question her teammates' exceedingly brutal attitudes that they held over from their criminal pasts.Uncanny X-Men #206 Subsequently Freedom Force was sent to arrest the Avengers after a disgruntled Quicksilver made false accusations against them. Freedom Force actually defeated the combined East and West Coast Avengers teams and helped bring the Avengers into custody at the Vault without a trial. Spider-Woman once again found her loyalties divided; she had a change of heart and eventually chose to aid the Avengers by breaking into the Vault and freeing them, battling the Guardsmen and thus becoming a fugitive from the law herself.Avengers Annual #15 While on the run from the law, she teamed up with Spider-Man occasionally. In another adventure she also teamed with Iron Man, to battle renegade A.I.M. agents named the Seekers, who sought to capture Valerie Cooper doing undercover solo work.Iron Man #214 In gratitude for her earlier assistance with the Avengers, Iron Man worked with the government to get her pardoned. Alongside Spider-Man, she battled the Wrecking Crew as a government assignment.Spectacular Spider-Man #125‚Äì126 Later, one of her assignments led her to California looking for a team of Asian supervillains called the Pacific Overlords. She met and assisted the Avengers West Coast against the Pacific Overlords, and battled U.S. Agent.Avengers West Coast #70‚Äì74 She was eventually offered membership in the team, and joined the Avengers West Coast.Avengers West Coast #75 As a member of the West Coast Avengers, Julia battled some of the Marvel Universe's major foes including Doctor Demonicus, Ultron and Mephisto as well as participating in the Infinity War cosmic crossover. In addition while still a member of the West Coast Avengers, Julia was chosen by Doctor Strange to be a founding member of the Secret Defenders in their first mission alongside Darkhawk (whom she would later recommend for West Coast Avengers membership), Wolverine and Nomad. When the West Coast Avengers disbanded, Julia joined their spin-off team Force Works, whose primary enemies included the alien Kree and long time Iron Man foe the Mandarin. She had a relationship with Moonraker during this time. Julia's main enemies in her solo adventures were the arachnid-based team called Death Web, which consisted of three supervillains who were created by The Commission, using a variation of the same serum which transformed Julia. When Mike Clemson, founder of Death Web, captured Spider-Woman's daughter Rachel, he blackmailed her into fighting Spider-Man. Even though she nearly killed Spider-Man, she would not commit an act of murder, and Spider-Man helped her rescue Rachel. Eventually, Julia walked away from the superhero business to concentrate on raising her daughter. Like Jessica Drew (the original Spider-Woman), Julia was attacked by Charlotte Witter and had her powers stolen. After the loss of her superpowers, Julia returned to the life of a normal mother. =Civil War= Julia Carpenter in her Arachne costume. Julia reappeared in a story arc of the 2006 Ms. Marvel series, using the codename Arachne (which she originally intended to use). Her powers have clearly been restored. During Civil War, Julia registers under the Superhuman Registration Act, and she and Wonder Man aid Ms. Marvel in the training of novice superheroes. However, Julia is shown to be a double agent; when she first responded to Iron Man's request, she thought it would be an opportunity to help people escape registration; she is shown to have tipped off Hobie Brown, the Prowler, moments before a S.H.I.E.L.D. capekiller squadron arrived at his home to arrest him, and she is thought to have warned many more heroes of impending arrests.Ms. Marvel vol. 2 #6 It is also revealed that she is romantically involved with the Shroud, an opponent of the Superhuman Registration Act. Julia's status is discovered when a captured Prowler reveals under interrogation that she tipped him off. The Shroud, who had been captured by Ms. Marvel,Ms. Marvel vol. 2 #8 reveals that Julia was paralyzed for several months after she lost her powers, even though all of her other injuries had healed. The Shroud's company had synthesized a duplicate of the serum that originally provided Julia with her powers, and these returned several days after it was administered to her. With the Shroud's help, Julia underwent intense physical therapy and was soon able to walk again. It was during this time that she and the Shroud fell in love. A government strike team led by Ms. Marvel, including Wonder Man and Ara√±a, attacks Julia at her home just as she was about to flee the country with her daughter. Julia is captured and summarily incarcerated. However, it is revealed in Ms. Marvel #13 that Julia escaped captivity during the Negative Zone prison break, and she returned to Colorado in search of Rachel. A S.H.I.E.L.D. Psy Ops team telepathically traces her to Brooklyn, where she furiously confronts and attacks Ara√±a, demanding to know where her daughter has been taken. She is subsequently defeated by Ara√±a with surprising ease due to her instability from losing her daughter. After being rendered unconscious by Ara√±a, she awakens aboard the Minicarrier 13 where Ms. Marvel endeavors to help Julia find Rachel.Ms. Marvel vol. 2 #14 =Omega Flight= Arachne became a member of the new Canada-based team Omega Flight and was given the option of having outstanding charges dropped in exchange for her participation on the team.

After escaping with Spider-Man from Ana and Alyosha Kravinoff, they are confronted by the Chameleon disguised as Ezekiel, who informs them of a battle between the Spider and Hunter tribes.The Amazing Spider-Man #634 Julia is then captured by the Kravinoffs, along with Anya Corazon and Madame Web as Kaine (who was dressed as Spider-Man) is sacrificed to resurrect Kraven the Hunter. When Madame Web was mortally wounded by Sasha Kravinoff, she transferred her prophetic powers (and blindness) to Julia, to become the new Madame Web. Julia's first action in this role is to prevent Peter from killing Kraven, explaining to Peter that he is the center of a moral web that would be destroyed if he killed Kraven, advising him that this murder, however justified, would turn him into a ruthless destroyer. After burying Kaine and Madame Web in a potter's field, she explains her new purpose to Spider-Man and Ara√±a before teleporting away.The Amazing Spider-Man #637 =Spider-Island= When the population of Manhattan develops spider-powers during the Spider- Island storyline, Julia observes the crisis with Shang-Chi, preventing him from intervening until Spider-Man is accidentally attacked by the New Avengers when he tries to help out.Amazing Spider-Man #668 Later, as Anti-Venom works on curing the individuals affected of their spider-powers, reflects on the need for both Venom and Anti-Venom to fix the Spider-Island problem, but also notes that for one of them, \\"your story ends here.\\"Amazing Spider-Man #669 At the conclusion of the crisis, she offers the spider-powers cure to Spider-Man himself, but he rejects it. As she departs, she apologizes for the suffering that is to come.The Amazing Spider-Man #672 While taking her daughter Rachel to summer school, Julia gets a vision telling her that the Great Web is unraveling. She then changes into her Madame Web gear and leaves to go speak to Spider-Man.The Amazing Spider-Man #689 While Spider-Man is fighting Morbius, the Living Vampire, Madame Web visits Spider-Man telling him that his life is in great danger. Although Spider-Man is concerned about Morbius, Madame Web states that Morbius is not the problem. She tells Spider-Man to return to Horizon Labs for a great tragedy lies in his future. She even tells Spider-Man that Silver Sable did not perish in the fight at Doctor Octopus' underwater hideout.The Amazing Spider-Man #690 Julia later detected that a new spider-based character has connected to the Web of Life as it shows that former Hobgoblin Roderick Kingsley was now working as Devil Spider.The Amazing Spider-Man #691 After having a particularly strong vision of the future of the Marvel Universe, Julia enters into a comatose state.The Amazing Spider-Man #695‚Äì697 =Spider-Verse= In the finale of the Spider-Verse storyline, Julia wakes out of her coma, and distresses over the Great Web's strands being severed by the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body) in a desperate attempt to alter his fate and prevent Peter Parker from returning. Though his attempt was thwarted, the damage caused to the Great Web had weakened every Spider's spider-sense and left Julia bereft of her precognition.The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 3 #15 =Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy= During the Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy storyline, Julia Carpenter is shown to be the one hacking into the computers of Jackal's company New U Technologies from her hideout in Alcatraz as seen when she has a clone of Prowler as her prisoner. It is also revealed that she has been doing this with Shroud's technology. Prowler angers Julia by severing the connection to stop her from looking more into New U Technologies. Julia finds out Madame Web was alive from telepathic feedback resulting from the attack of the female Electro. Prowler tells Julia what New U Technologies has accomplished and tries to get her to join them. She refuses and escapes in a puff of black smoke.Prowler vol. 2 #2 After Prowler escapes from Electro, Julia finds him and takes him on her boat, where they head towards New U Technologies to get his New U Pills.Prowler vol. 2 #3 Julia helps Prowler break into New U Technologies and takes Prowler to his room to get his pills. Julia uses the opportunity to investigate the near-abandoned facility. She is led to Madame Web, who refuses to take her medication to aid her in healing from Electro's attack. Madame Web has seen the future and refuses to be a part of it, and warns Julia to save Prowler before she dies from clone degeneration. Julia confronts Prowler in the facility, who is breaking down from clone degeneration and accuses her of being the culprit. He tries to defeat her and Julia is left no choice but to fight back. She knocks him down as Prowler's body continues deteriorating.Prowler vol. 2 #4 Prowler was in an alley when he proves too weak to continue and he was found by the murderous Electro, Julia Carpenter arrives and fends Electro off as she tells Prowler that Spider-Man's stabilized the human and clone cells. When Electro gets the upper hand on Julia, Prowler sacrifices himself to stop Electro and dies in Julia's arms. Later, Julia talks to the real Prowler who just emerged from cryo-sleep and tells him about his clone's actions.Prowler Vol. 2 #5 Powers and abilities Spider-Woman possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes. She also possesses the ability to spin a \\"psi-web\\" of psionic energy between two surfaces. This web, once solidified, possesses sufficient tensile strength to support a 10-ton weight. It remains in effect for up to approximately 1 hour. She can also project and release sufficient psionic energy through her hands and feet to enable her to walk on walls and ceilings. Julia's powers originally required considerable concentration for her to manifest them, and she found that physical gesturing aids her in the weaving of her psionic webs. By using psychokinetic energy, Spider-Woman can bind ambient free-floating molecules into strands of solid force. Her psi-webs can be used to wrap enemies, or focused into narrow web-lines that she can swing from. Due to their psychic nature, her psi-webs can form from a distance, and she can mentally control the movement of her webbing. In addition to her natural superhuman advantages, she has been extensively trained by the Commission on Superhuman Activities in espionage and hand-to-hand combat. Although she lost her powers at one time, she regained them through a duplicate serum . She has heightened senses, and feels vibrations as does a spider in its web. Her senses allow her to detect a hollow area under a solid steel floor by walking over it. In addition to her own powers, Julia now possesses the powers of Madame Web, including telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, and the ability to sense the presence of psionic powers in others. However, she has lost her eyesight in the process of gaining these new powers. Despite her blindness, she is able to stalemate Spider-Man (with his new training in martial arts taught to him by Shang Chi, but lacking his Spider-Sense) using her clairvoyance in battle.The Amazing Spider-Man #666 Costume * When, in the Secret Wars storyline, Spider-Man first laid eyes on the symbiote black costume that would eventually become the symbiote- charged villain known as Venom, he surmised that he had subconsciously redesigned his costume to look more like Julia's.Secret Wars #8 During her brief tenure with Omega Flight, Julia began wearing a redesigned costume similar to her original one.Omega Flight #1 After gaining Madame Web's mental powers, she passed her Arachne costume on to Anya Corazon, who then goes on to wear it as Spider-Girl. Other versions In the X-Men Forever comics, Julia is Spider-Woman in her classic black-and-white costume, and a core member of the Avengers. However, she displays the powers of Jessica Drew as she is able to fire venom-blasts at Gambit when the X-Men are ordered to be arrested. She is also able to fly by unknown means as she does not have the glider-webs Jessica Drew uses to glide.X-Men Forever 2 #1 In a possible future, Julia is seen wearing a modified version of her original costume, with belts and straps and silver duplicates of the Black Widow's gauntlets. She is a member of a superhero team whose members include Punisher, Daredevil, and Rhino.Ant-Man and Wasp #3 A monstrous spider-like version of Arachne originates from a dark reality where Death has no power called the Cancerverse, and is killed by Ronan the Accuser when she attempts to invade the Earth-616 reality.Thanos Imperative #1 The Ultimate Marvel equivalent of Spider-Woman posed as Julia Carpenter for a time.Ultimate Comics: Mystery #2 In other mediaTelevision= Iron Man animated series. * Julia Carpenter as Spider-Woman appeared regularly in the 1994 Iron Man animated series, voiced by Casey DeFranco in season one and Jennifer Hale in season two.

The station broadcasts at 970 kHz with 5,000 watts day and night. WBGG's studios are located in Green Tree, and its transmitter is located in Ross Township, Pennsylvania. HistoryBeginnings as WWSW= The station was originally at 1500 (later 1490), and moved to 970 in November 1949, requiring an eight-tower directional array to use the frequency. This large array was one of the first of its kind in the United States. For many years, this station was WWSW with a MOR music format aimed at older adults. In the early 1970s, General Manager Charles Warner instituted a news-heavy morning show to compete with market leader KDKA. =Country, Talk and Oldies= In 1980, two format changes were instituted at WWSW and its sister station, known for the past seven years at WPEZ. The latter switched from Top 40 to adult contemporary music and proved to be a blueprint for its present-day success. As for the former, a disastrous and abrupt format change to country music (as \\"Double Country\\") eventually resulted in the abandonment of the historic call letters and a switch to talk as WTKN, with the moniker \\"We're Talking Pittsburgh!\\" Legendary Pittsburgh air personality Doug \\"Uncle Dougie\\" Hoerth was among the staff hosts under this format, which proved to be no match for the higher rated KDKA and WTAE. Later, the WWSW calls were reclaimed. In February 1988, WWSW and sister WWSW-FM simultaneously switched to separate oldies formats, with the FM concentrating more on hits of the 1960s and 1970s, while the AM focused on 1950s and 1960s music. By 1991, the AM became a complete simulcast of the FM station, known as ‚Äú3WS‚Äù, by the end of the decade. =As WBGG= On August 28, 2000, 970 switched call letters to WBGG, breaking away from the simulcast to become a Fox Sports Radio affiliate. At first, the station was known as \\"970 The Burgh,\\" but today, the station calls itself \\"970 ESPN\\", as it is now an affiliate of ESPN Radio. The two stations had a common bond as, in addition to being co-owned, they were the flagship stations for the Pittsburgh Penguins. The FM outlet for Penguins switched to sister station WXDX-FM in the 2006-07 hockey season while University of Pittsburgh football and basketball switched to WWSW. In addition, WBGG, along with sister station WDVE, is the flagship station for the Pittsburgh Steelers. While WDVE originates the broadcast, the contract with the Steelers specifies that the games also be aired on an AM radio station in the market. Local programming was highlighted by former Steelers Tunch Ilkin and Craig Wolfley 10a-12p, Stan Savran 12-2p, and Adam Crowley from 4-7p. The online publication (970espn.com) is also the home of several sports blogs including the \\"Pens Bender Blog\\" by Rich Miller. On January 1, 2011 WBGG became an affiliate of the ESPN Radio Network as WEAE changed to Radio Disney. On September 9, 2015 it was announced that WBGG Pittsburgh launched an FM translator station, W292DH, located at 106.3, licensed to Uniontown. Since 2013, WBGG has been the flagship station in the Pittsburgh area for the Robert Morris Colonials football, men's basketball, and men's ice hockey teams, as well as select women's basketball and women's ice hockey games. The station also broadcasts the weekly football coach's show with head coach Bernard Clark Jr. every Thursday night during college football season, men's basketball coach's show with head coach Andrew Toole every Wednesday night during college basketball season, and men's hockey coach's show with head coach Derek Schooley every Tuesday night during college hockey season. The station also broadcasts The Keith Dambrot Show, a weekly show featuring Duquesne men's basketball head coach Keith Dambrot. During the season for the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins, the station broadcasts a weekly Monday night show called Along the Boards, hosted by Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Penguins beat writer Jason Mackey and Penguins radio color analyst and former player Phil Bourque.

Like Spider-Woman volume 1, Spider-Woman volume 3 pitted the protagonist against macabre and grotesque villains, and featured a closing story arc in which she looks into a mirror and sees her own face shriveled down to skin and bones. As a running joke, Spider-Woman constantly changes costumes throughout the series, including a four-issue run (#2‚Äì5) in which she adopts a new costume every issue. However, sales were mediocre and the series was cancelled with issue #18 (December 2000).

It is set in Edwardian London where the world, like main character Leonard Morley's life, is changing. We start the book with a single note which seems to leave a smudge on Leonard and his family life. The book continues with himself, two sons, a daughter and a wife as well as a large extended family all making room for one more, when curiously charming 'Doctor' Tobias Taylor appears on the scene. However curiosity killed more than just a cat, as the family soon finds out. Leonard Morley, in the very first chapter, receives a threatening note, requesting blood money in the absence of Mr Whiteley, his manager and Leonard informs his wife of it, who dismisses it avidly. However, over time more of these notes turn up, and when the fourth has found its way to Leonard, he resolves to tell Mr Whiteley. But whilst waiting to speak to him, Mr Whiteley is shot, and is lying in a pool of blood. In the court scene, where Leonard stands as witness, all over London people flock to see the trial. In the end, Horace Rayner is charged with murder, and given a life sentence. This book very cleverly entwines fact with fiction, and Whiteley's assassination being involved is the first example that comes to mind.

The station, which is owned by Gagan Deep, through licensee Radio 1150 Limited Liability Company, broadcasts at 1150 kHz with a power level of 1,000 watts daytime and 70 watts night, and using a two-tower directional antenna system. WMNY is licensed to New Kensington, Pennsylvania. History The station was once a Top 40 outlet, WKPA, and was a sister station to WYDD. The construction permit for WKPA was granted on June 25, 1940. The station was initially licensed to operate at the federally assigned frequency of 1120 kHz, with a power output of 250 watts daytime only. The station was granted permission to operate from October 3 to October 8 with extended hours to 10pm for dedicatory program reasons. The FCC also granted permission for WKPA to remain on the air until 3am from November 5 to 6 for election return reports. WKPA operated at this frequency until the NARBA frequency re-allocation act was adopted in 1941. That year, WKPA moved to its present dial position but continued to operate at its daytime-only status. WKPA was a typical, small-town radio station of its day. Local news, sports, and talk from the steel town of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, 20 miles northeast of downtown Pittsburgh. The station began at 810 Fifth Avenue, New Kensington, on the second floor of a two-story building that also housed a music store on the ground floor. Cooper Brothers, the owners of the music store, operated WKPA under the corporate name of Allegheny-Kiski Broadcasting Company, with Edward Kroen serving as the station's general manager and program director. In 1957, Allegheny-Kiski Broadcasting Company applied for a construction permit to increase WKPA's power to its current level of one thousand watts, daytime only, which required the construction of a second antenna at its transmitter site in East Deer Township. Concurrently, the company applied for permission to add a second studio location at 321 Fifth Avenue in Tarentum. This second studio stayed in operation until 1963. The Cooper family sold the station on July 2, 1964 to Pittsburgh entrepreneur Nelson L. Goldberg, who by then worked for the Cooper family as WKPA's general manager. Goldberg operated the station until its 1990 sale as Gateway Broadcasting Enterprises, Inc., not to be confused with Gateway Communications, which at that time owned a television station in Altoona, though both companies had roots in television. Original station location at 810 Fifth Avenue from 1940 to 1993. A roof collapse over the second-floor studios forced WGBN to relocate to another building at 955 Fourth Avenue in 1993. WKPA on-air studio in 1990, while at its original studio building at 810 Fifth Avenue in New Kensington. This studio was switched to production use only the following year, when a newer studio with more state-of-the-art equipment was put on the air. WKPA talk studio at 810 Fifth Avenue. The former WYDD on-air studio is in the background, and the WKPA main on-air studio could be viewed through the window at the right (partially hidden). =WKPA: the birthplace of modern cable TV= Goldberg, an innovator, pioneer and visionary in the telecommunications industry, developed the first cable system to be acquired by Comcast. The son of the late Edward and Fannie Menzer Goldberg, was a native of New Kensington, Pennsylvania. Goldberg‚Äôs career began in radio sales at WKPA in New Kensington. In 1958, at the age of 28, Goldberg became General Manager of WKPA and then purchased the station in 1964. Goldberg acquired WYDD-FM in 1963 and operated the radio stations for more than 25 years. Goldberg developed WEFB-TV (TV3) and Westmoreland Cable in 1968, one of the first cable franchises in western Pennsylvania. The cable system was later sold to Comcast Corporation. In the 1980s, Goldberg was the first to privately own satellite transponders and perceptively anticipated the advent of commercial television satellite broadcasting. Throughout his career, he continuously broke ground in developing new kinds of broadcast programming and the manner in which they were transmitted. As his company's reputation grew, so did that of WKPA. WGBN studio building at 955 Fourth Avenue. Now renovated, this building was heavily damaged by fire in 1994. WGBN occupied the second floor, accessible from the door on the right. The station had been at this location for only about a year. =The sale of WKPA= Both stations were sold to California-based Salem Communications Corporation in the late '80s; the transaction was not completed until early 1990. When Salem assumed ownership, WKPA and WYDD (which by this time had become known as Top 40 rocker WNRJ) immediately underwent changes: WYDD switched from Top 40 to an easy listening format and the subsequent call letter change to WEZE-FM, with WKPA simulcasting WEZE's programming Monday through Friday, with existing weekend oldies and ethnic programming as its only original programming. WEZE-FM moved its studios to suburban Pittsburgh in the spring of 1991, leaving WKPA at its Fifth Avenue location, but continuing the simulcast. Later that year, Salem officials announced that WEZE-FM would drop its easy listening format for Christian Talk, the benchmark format for the other corporate-owned stations. As part of the change, WKPA would have to originate its own programming as part of the contract deals Salem had with its client ministries. Salem appointed a former WEZE-FM announcer, Ken Hawk (who at 21 became one of the youngest radio executives in commercial radio history. Brian Mroziak at nearby WMBS was later another) to manage WKPA's operations. Under Hawk's direction, WKPA brought back a live adult contemporary morning show with local news and talk, plus a nationally syndicated talk format for weekday programming. The oldies and ethnic programming remained untouched. The rebirth of WKPA was successful but short-lived, with Salem spinning off WKPA to Pentecostal Temple Development Corporation in November 1992 =Born again: WGBN Gospel 1150= Salem donated WKPA to PTDC as a gift to the East Liberty-based church headed by pastor Rev Dr. Loran Mann, who changed the format to Black Gospel and the station's call letters to WGBN. The station made history as the first full- time gospel-formatted station in the Pittsburgh market (others followed with little success) and remains so today. Programming is made up of sermons from Pentecostal Temple, and music is provided by Musical Soul Food Network's \\"Rejoice!\\" format. WGBN's current studio location since 1995 is at 560 7th Street in New Kensington. The radio station occupies the ground and second floor of half of this building. WGBN swapped call signs on March 1, 2014 with sister station WMNY AM 1360. Effective January 3, 2018, Pentecostal Temple Development sold WMNY to Radio 1150 Limited Liability Company. Changes WMNY today broadcasts from studios on Seventh Street in downtown New Kensington. The station was forced to abandon its original location at the Cooper Brothers building after the roof over its studios collapsed in 1994. The station then moved one block over to 955 Fourth Avenue, where it occupied the second floor, but the station would only be there for a year. In 1995, a fire gutted out both WGBN and the computer business that occupied the ground floor of the building both were housed in. Though WGBN's losses were covered by insurance, it would be more than six months until the station was able to return to the air from its new location at 560 Seventh Street, where it remains today. Famous voices Among the talent that has roamed in and out of WKPA through the years includes Bob Livorio, Jeff Allen, Charlie Apple, Alex Mellon, Porky Chedwick, Sean Israel, Joe Fenn, Jim DeCesare, Ford Shankle, Kelly Pidgeon, Mike Alexander and George Hart.

Customers of such licensing schemes are typically business, governmental or educational institutions, with prices for volume licensing varying depending on the type, quantity and applicable subscription- term. For example, Microsoft software available through volume-licensing programs includes Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office. Traditionally, a volume licensing key (VLK), which could be supplied to all instances of the licensed computer program, was involved in volume licensing. With the popularity of the software as a service practices, volume licensing customers only supply their software with credentials belonging to an online user account instead, which is used for other aspects of services and provisioning.  Overview  Traditionally, a product key has been supplied with computer programs. It acts analogously to a password: The computer programs of the old ask the user to prove their entitlement; in response, the user provides this key. This key, however, must only be used once, i.e. on one computer. A volume licensing key (VLK), however, can be used on several computers. Vendors can take additional steps to ensure that their products' key are only used in the intended number. These efforts are called product activation. Volume licenses are not always transferable. For example, only some types of Microsoft volume license can be transferred, provided a formal transfer process is completed, which enables Microsoft to register the new owner. A very small number of software vendors specialize in brokering such transfers in order to allow the selling of volume licenses and keys. The most notable of these, Discount- Licensing, pioneered the sale of Microsoft volume licenses in this way.  Notable examples  Microsoft = Product key on a certificate of authenticity for Windows Vista Home Premium Microsoft has been engaged in volume licensing since its inception, as the enterprise sector is its primary market. With the release of Windows XP in 2001, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Product Activation, a digital rights management (DRM) scheme to curb software piracy among consumers by verifying the user's entitlement to the product license. At the time, however, the volume-licensed versions of Windows XP were exempt from this measure. (See .) Starting with Windows Vista, Microsoft introduced two volume licensing methods for IT professionals in charge of installing Windows in organizations, both of which are covered by Microsoft Product Activation: The first is Multiple Activation Keys (MAK), which are the same as Windows XP's volume licensing keys but require product activation. The second is Key Management Server (KMS) and its corresponding keys. Hosts activated via a KMS have to report back to a software license server once every 180 days.Top 7 Things You Should Know About Activation and Genuine Windows (PowerPoint, referred from Windows Activation  Genuine Windows 7, Vista, XP  TechNet) Licenses using these schemes can be procured via the Microsoft Software Assurance program. A large group of Microsoft customers are OEMs that assemble and sell computers, such as desktops, laptops, tablet computers and mobile device. In the devices sold by these OEMs, Windows license data is stored in the computer's BIOS in an area referred to as the \\"ACPI_SLIC\\", so that KMS can detect the use of previous Microsoft products even with the storage device removed or erased. For Windows Vista and Windows 7, the SLIC data are complementary; a volume licensing product key is still supplied with the device, which the user needs in the event of reinstalling Windows. Starting with Windows 8, however, everything needed to authorize the device is stored with SLIC data. In 2010, Microsoft introduced the Office 365 licensing program. in which Microsoft Office, Microsoft Exchange Server and Skype for Business Server products are licensed based on the software as a service (SaaS) model: In exchange for a monthly subscription fee, software, its updates, support for them, provisioning, administration, licensing and additional services are all provided through an online web-based dashboard. In this scheme, licensed apps communicate recurrently with Microsoft over the Internet; as such, a product key needs not be issued to the user. Instead the administrator needs to sign up for Microsoft account, which holds details such as licensed apps, their number, and payment methods. This account is protected by credentials such as a username and a password. = Adobe = Introduced in 2011, Adobe Creative Cloud is a SaaS offering in which software produced by Adobe, their updates, support for them, provisioning, administration, licensing and additional services are all provided over the Internet, in exchange for a monthly subscription fee. As with the Office 365, a user account registered with Adobe is all that is required to authorize software and store payment information.  Unauthorized use  Microsoft has blocked several volume license keys that have been abused in service packs, starting with Windows XP Service Pack 1. Microsoft even developed a new key verification engine for Windows XP Service Pack 2 that could detect illicit keys, even those that had never been used before. Several security consultants have condemned the move by Microsoft, saying that leaving a large install base unpatched from various security holes is irresponsible because this unpatched install base can be leveraged in large scale Internet attacks, such as Trojan horses used to send spam e-mail. Others have come to Microsoft's defense, arguing that Microsoft should not have to provide support for illegal users. After much public outcry, Microsoft elected to disable the new key verification engine. Service Pack 2 only checks for the same small list of commonly used keys as Service Pack 1. Users of existing installations of Windows XP can also change their product key by following instructions from Microsoft.Microsoft Help and Support: How to change the product key at the time of activation = Leaked keys = A volume license key that was commonly used to bypass product activation in early versions of Microsoft's Windows XP operating system was \`FCKGW-RHQQ2-YXRKT-8TG6W-2B7Q8\`.bit-tech.net: Microsoft outlines Vista piracy plans, Published on 5 October 2006 by Wil Harris This key was part of the first warez release of the final version of Windows XP by a group called devils0wn, 35 days before the official retail release on 28 August 2001. The key is now obsolete, as it has been blacklisted by Microsoft since August 2004, and affected computers will display a WGA notification.arstechnica.com: Windows Genuine Advantage for dummies By Matt Mondok  Last updated 29 November 2006 6:19 PM It was made famous partly because it featured in a popular image circulated on the Internet before the retail launch of Windows XP. In the image, the key is written on a CD-R containing the leaked operating system and held in front of a digital Microsoft sign counting down the days until the release of Windows XP. Users using these keys will receive an error message when they install the latest service pack, and such users are told to obtain a legitimate license and change their product key. = Public KMS servers = Any client machine with the correct KMS client setup keys can authenticate against any KMS server. KMS client keys are well known and documented publicly by Microsoft.Volume activation: Plan for volume activation: Appendix A: KMS Client Setup Keys, Published: 24 August 2012, Updated: 16 July 2014, https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj612867.aspx KMS servers require a minimum of 25 clients to properly activate, but also stop counting additional licenses beyond 50, and automatically accept any client key once reaching the 25 client threshold. Businesses operating KMS servers are required to properly shield the KMS server behind firewalls so that it cannot be reached from the Internet, and be used to authorize illegal use of KMS client keys by the general public. Public exposure of a KMS server can result in Microsoft revoking the server key, thereby disabling all attaching clients. External KMS server access is desirable for devices on long-term leave away from the corporate network, as KMS client activation will expire after six months of not being able to contact a KMS server. For this situation, a business can make it accessible through a virtual private network (VPN) known only to the devices outside the corporate network. = KMS server and client emulators = An unofficial KMS server emulator exists that will activate Windows or Office even if the software was not licensed or paid for, regardless of whether or not there are 25 or more computers on the network, and regardless of whether or not a previous version of Windows was installed. There is also a program that will send KMS requests to a legitimate KMS server, in order to fool the server into thinking that there are 25 or more computers on the network. Microsoft considers both of these exploits to be a violation of the Terms and Conditions.

It ranges from a transactional sex relationship to a client paying a sex worker to pretend to be his girlfriend during the session. Within the sex industry, GFE is a common term for a sexual encounter in which both the sex worker and the client are willing to engage in reciprocal sexual pleasure and some degree of emotional intimacy. A \\"girlfriend experience\\" generally involves more personal interaction than a traditional call girl or escort offers. There is a focus on not just having sex, but also having more of a comprehensive experience. The details vary widely from person to person. In the field of sex work, sex workers impart a sense of authenticity in order to make the experience more pleasurable for their customer, as well as to make the outcome more lucrative for themselves. According to sociologist Elizabeth Bernstein, this makes it more meaningful for both client and sex worker as it involves a particular form of emotional labor. Paying for any sexual act, including GFE, is considered to be a form of prostitution regardless of the type of service involved. Because of this the legality of GFE varies from place to place. If the sex worker is male, the service is called a boyfriend experience.  Girlfriend experience and prostitution  Indoor prostitution, which includes the use of massage parlors, saunas, brothels, strip clubs and escort agencies, is more likely than street prostitution to involve conversation, affection and mutual sexual pleasure. A GFE may start with dinner at a restaurant followed by making out on the sofa in an apartment and end with non-rushed sex and cuddling. The average cost of a GFE can range anywhere from $200 to $ 1200 depending on a number of factors, mainly duration of experience and the quality of the woman providing the service. Escorts traditionally have a reputation for not kissing their clients and it used to be the norm for legal prostitutes to kiss on the mouth. Some ranch brothels in the United States advertise themselves as GFE establishments, including Dennis Hof's Love Ranch South, Moonlite Bunny Ranch, Kit Kat Ranch and Sheri's Ranch. Clients or hobbyists The term \\"client\\" is sometimes used to describe a person who pays prostitutes for sex. However, in the escort agency code that has grown up around the GFE, clients often call themselves \\"hobbyists\\" and refer to a prostitute who provides GFE as a \\"nice girl\\". In a GFE situation the client would pay for time spent with the call girl meaning: social interaction, dating, or sexual acts. Clients could come from all different backgrounds (white-collar, blue collar, different races, different ages) therefore there is not a \\"typical\\" type of client using the GFE service. Many clients emerge through the need for a feeling of closeness without the commitment of a relationship. To a certain extent it eliminates the feeling of guilt or fear of \\"addiction\\" to a relationship. Southeast Asia Research in Cambodia published in 2010 identified a number of waitresses and bartenders who were also working as \\"professional girlfriends\\" with \\"western boyfriends\\". They relied on these relationships for their livelihood but did not regard themselves as \\"prostitutes\\" and often sought love and marriage as well as material comforts. In these relationships there was a performance of intimacy which lay somewhere between the feigned and the genuine. In Thailand some independent sex workers are reported to work as \\"professional girlfriends\\", providing company and affection to foreign men and middle-class Thai men, and only having sex with their clients occasionally. Their remuneration is provided in the form of things such as clothing and visits to the cinema.

In addition, it may have a sheet of konbu and a skewer of dried persimmons under the mochi. It sits on a stand called a over a sheet called a , which is supposed to ward off fires from the house for the following years. Sheets of paper called folded into lightning shapes similar to those seen on sumo wrestler's belts are also attached. The kagami mochi first appeared in the Muromachi period (14th‚Äì16th century). The name kagami (\\"mirror\\") is said to have originated from its resemblance to an old-fashioned kind of round copper mirror, which also had a religious significance. The reason for it is not clear. Explanations include mochi being a food for special days, the spirit of the rice plant being found in the mochi, and the mochi being a food which gives strength. The two mochi discs are variously said to symbolize the going and coming years, the human heart, \\"yin\\" and \\"yang\\", or the moon and the sun. The \\"daidai\\", whose name means \\"generations\\", is said to symbolize the continuation of a family from generation to generation. Traditionally the kagami mochi was placed in various locations throughout the house. Nowadays it is usually placed in a household Shinto altar, or kamidana. It has also been placed in the tokonoma, a small decorated alcove in the main room of the home. Contemporary kagami mochi are often pre-moulded into the shape of stacked discs and sold in plastic packages in the supermarket. A mikan or a plastic imitation daidai is often substituted for the original daidai. Variations in the shape of kagami mochi are also seen. In some regions, three layered kagami mochi are also used. The three layered kagami mochi are placed on the butsudan or on the kamidana. There is also a variant decoration called an okudokazari placed in the centre of the kitchen or by the window which has three layers of mochi. It is traditionally broken and eaten in a Shinto ritual called kagami biraki (mirror opening) on the second Saturday or Sunday of January. This is an important ritual in Japanese martial arts dojos.

Personal life The seventh of ten children, Ritz showed artistic talent at an early age. She attended the Layton School of Art, married World War II navy veteran and athlete, Erwin Ritz in 1946 and is the mother of four children: Barbara Bray, Sandra Ritz, Terry Leach and The Environmentalist publisher and managing editor, Janet Ritz. Early career After her marriage to Erwin Ritz in 1946, Ritz moved from Milwaukee, WI, where she grew up, to Washington DC. There, she worked with a group of artists in Georgetown. During this time, several of Ritz's selected works (oil paintings) won places in national juried shows at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian, and received an honorable mention at the Flower Gallery. It was during these years in Washington DC, that Ritz first covered US Senate and US Congressional hearings, including the McCarthy Hearings, where cameras were barred. Ritz worked under contract for the Washington Post, CBS, Public TV, and the Associated Press. Selected drawings appeared in the Washington Post from these hearings. Courtroom art In 1966, at the height of the Haight Ashbury counter-culture era, Ritz moved with her family to the San Francisco Bay Area. Ritz's sketches of the street scenes were published in the City Magazine and the San Francisco Examiner. Her work in Washington DC brought her to the attention of the local public television station KQED. From there, she began a career covering trials for the local CBS outlet, (KPIX) and for the Associated Press. This included the Patty Hearst trial, the Sirhan Sirhan trial, the Charles Manson trial, the trials of the Black Panthers, including Huey Newton, Eldridge Cleaver and David Hilliard, the trials of Angela Davis and Ruchell Magee, and the trials of the Soledad Brothers, the San Quentin Six, Mass Murderer Juan Corona, John Linley Frazier, the Presidio Mutiny Court-Martial at Fort Ord, the Billy Dean Smith Court-Martial, Inez Garcia (second trial), Bill and Emily Harris (Symbionese Liberation Army), Russell Little and Joseph Remiro (Murder of Marcus Foster/Symbionese Liberation Army), Wendy Yoshimura, Camarillo State Hospital Grand Jury Hearings, the Hell's Angels, Alioto-Look Magazine Libel Trial, Alioto Conflict of Interest Trial, the Bonanno Brothers, Stephanie Kline, Larry Layton, Dan White, San Francisco Proposition Hearings, Sara Jane Moore, and Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo/Pentagon Papers.

The practice of cyber-dissidence may have been inaugurated by Dr. Daniel Mengara, a Gabonese scholar and activist living in political exile in New Jersey in the United States. In 1998, he created a website in French whose name Bongo Doit Partir (Bongo Must Go)Bongo Doit Partir (Bongo Must Go) was clearly indicative of its purpose: it encouraged a revolution against the then 29-year-old regime of Omar Bongo in Gabon. The original URL, http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/, began to redirect to http://www.bdpgabon.org in the year 2000. Inaugurating what was to become common current-day practice in the politically involved blogosphere, this movement's attempt at rallying the Gabonese around revolutionary ideals and actions has ultimately been vindicated by the 2011 Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, where the Internet has proved to be an effective tool for instigating successful critique, opposition and revolution against dictators. At least two nonprofit organizations are currently working to raise awareness of the contributions of cyber-dissidents and to defend them against the human rights violations to which some of them are subjected: Global Voices Online and Reporters Without Borders. The latter has released a Handbook For Bloggers and Cyber-Dissidents and maintains a roster of currently imprisoned cyber- dissidents. The committee to Protect Bloggers has been created. In regions where print and broadcast media are tightly controlled, anonymous online postings by cyber-dissidents may be the only source of information about the experiences, feelings, and opinions of ordinary citizens. This advantage may be offset by the difficulty in assessing the good faith and accuracy of reports originating from anonymous sources. Recently, social-media tools have been widely credited with igniting pervasive social upheavals, some of which have even brought down governments.

The sole species, Cadellia pentastylis, commonly known as ooline, is a medium to large tree with bright green leaves and rough tile-pattern bark. It has rain forest origins dating from the Pleistocene Era when much of Australia was wetter than it is today. It grows on moderately fertile soils, preferably those suited for agriculture or pasture development. Due to extensive forest clearing, it is now considered a vulnerable plant in Australia.  Description  The Cadellia tree grows to be about 10 m - rarely 25 m in height. It has leaves that are alternate, undivided and obovate or \\"oval\\" in shape. Flowering occurs from about October to December. The flowers have five white petals, about 5‚Äì7 mm in length. The ooline's fruit is brownish, wrinkled, and remains surrounded by five red sepals at its base. Fruiting generally occurs from November to December. The fruit's edibility for humans is not stated.  Distribution  Cadellia pentastylis is listed as vulnerable under the Australian Environment and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Small and typically fragmented stands of Ooline may be found in scattered localities on the lower western slopes of Australia's great dividing range between latitudes of 24¬∫S to 30¬∫S. Populations are known from the North Western Slopes of NSW, such as around Tenterfield, Terry Hie Hie, Gunnedah and Moree. Ooline can also be found in Sundown National Park and Tregole National Park in Queensland.  Taxonomy  The Cadellia is one of four sections of the Fables clade. Its pollen is prolate spheroidal, striate with a granular aperture surface membrane. Pollen morphology has linked the Surianaceae in a clade comprising Polygalaceae, Fabaceae, and Quillaja. There are also strong genetic affinities between the Mexican endemic genus Recchia and Cadellia. These can be determined by different types of microscopy, such as; light microscopy, scanning electro microscopy, transmission electro microscopy.

Sometimes, these cat body-type mutations are striking enough that humans select for and perpetuate them. This is not always in the best interests of the cat, as many of these mutations are harmful; some are even lethal in their homozygous form. Scottish Fold, a cat breed with naturally occurring folded ears This page gives a selection of cat body type mutant alleles and the associated mutations with a brief description.  Tail types  A cat with the Japanese Bobtail mutation Jb = Japanese bobtail gene (autosomal dominant). Cats homozygous and heterozygous for this gene display shortened and kinked tails. Cats homozygous for the gene tend to have shorter more kinked tails. This can be distinguished phenotypically from the Manx cat mutation by the presence of kinking in the tail, often forming what looks like a knot at the distal end of the tail. Unlike the Manx tailless gene, there are no associated skeletal disorders and the gene is not associated with lethality. A Japanese Bobtail's bobbed tailM = Manx tailless gene (dominant with high penetrance). Cats with the homozygous genotype (MM) die before birth, and stillborn kittens show gross abnormalities of the central nervous system. Cats with the heterozygous genotype (Mm) show severely shortened tail length, ranging from taillessness to a partial, stumpy tail. Some Manx cats die before 12 months old and exhibit skeletal and organ defects. Because it was discovered in naturally occurring populations of cats, the Manx gene could confer some kind of selective advantage to the cats, or it may simply be an example of the founder effect. The trait also occurred and died out in Cornwall (peninsular England), but persisted in the Isle of Man population where outbreeding was not frequent due to isolation. A Manx cat Shortened tails, most of which are indistinguishable from the Japanese Bobtail or the variably expressed Manx mutation, may occur sporadically in any cat breed or mixed-breed population. However, some may be novel mutations that have not been investigated. There are multiple types of curly-tailed cats whose tails loop over the back or form tight corkscrews. One such mutation has been developed into the American Ringtail, but others have been regarded as curiosities and not perpetuated. The gene(s) responsible have not been fully investigated. However, a research study is under way at UC Davis under the guidance of Leslie A. Lyons, currently at the University of Missouri: http://felinegenetics.missouri.edu/feline-genome-project-2  Limbs  Mk = Munchkin gene (dominant). Cats heterozygous for this gene (Mkmk) have shortened legs, but are not disabled. They have a ferret-like gait. The homozygous form (MkMk) may be lethal as litter sizes are smaller than average. Although there was initial concern that Munchkin-type cats would have impaired mobility or spinal problems, this was based on comparison with dog breeds and proved to be unfounded due to the cat's more flexible spine. The mutation has occurred naturally in many locations and has also been perpetuated in feral cats without human intervention (Robinson 1999). This gene is the basis for several intentionally selected breeds of dwarf cat. The mutation has proven not to be achondroplasia, but is most likely to be either hypochondroplasia or pseudochondroplasia, which affect the long bones of the leg while leaving other bodily proportions, especially the head, unchanged.  Paws  Sh = Split Foot (Syndactyly). A dominant gene that reduces the number of toes resulting in a \\"lobster-claw\\" appearance. This is considered an undesirable mutation. Polydactyl (extra-toed) cats. There are probably many genes, both dominant and recessive, that cause polydactyly in cats. Most cases of polydactyly in cats are perfectly harmless. Pd = Thumb-cat polydactyly gene. The Pd gene (dominant with incomplete penetrance) causes the benign, pre-axial form of polydactyly where one or more extra toes occur near the dew claw. Often, the dew claw is converted into a thumb. There are occasional problems, such as fused claws or claws facing in the wrong direction, but, generally, this form of polydactyly is harmless. On the other hand, the \\"hamburger-feet\\" polydactyly gene is associated with the gene for radial hypoplasia (RH). The 1995 European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals considers RH an impairing condition. In a scandal in the late 1990s, an experimental breeder in Texas tried to perpetuate this deformity as the \\"Twisty Cat\\" breed.Twisty Cats and the Ethics of Breeding for Deformity Mild RH can cause the post-axial form of polydactyly ‚Äì enlarged paws, extra three-jointed toes on the outer, little-toe side of the paws, and no thumb. X-rays can determine the structure of the extra toes and whether the cat has the gene for RH. Cats with the gene for RH should never be bred. Cats with severe RH have unusually short front legs. They move like a ferret and they tend to sit like a squirrel or kangaroo and are colloquially known as squittens. In some RH cats, the forelegs are twisted with the long bones either severely shortened or absent. All polydactyl cats are banned from German cat shows, possibly because of confusion with the impairing form of polydactyly associated with RH. Polydactyl cats are relatively common in southwest Britain, Norway, Sweden, and the eastern coast of the United States and Canada, and some parts of Asia. Sailors thought they were lucky. Various folktales and dubious assumptions about polydactyl cats include that they are superior rodent hunters, that they have better balance on ships in stormy weather, that their paws are natural snowshoes, and that the opposable thumbs (in the thumb-cat form of polydactyly) give them a survival advantage. Ernest Hemingway collected polydactyl cats, and the descendants of his pets may still be found at the Ernest Hemingway House in Key West.  Ear types  Cu = American Curl gene (dominant). Cats with this gene have ears that start out normal, but gradually curl backwards. So far, no major harmful defects have been associated with this gene, however, due to the more exposed inner ear regular cleaning is required to prevent infection. Curled ears have also been observed in free- roaming cats in the Greek islands and in a cat in Australia. Fd = Scottish Fold gene (dominant with incomplete penetrance). Cats with this gene have ears that curl forward. There are different degrees of folding, and more genes may be involved in the expression of the Fd gene. This gene is associated with bone and cartilage defects such as thickened tail and swollen feet. The homozygous form (FdFd) causes severe osteochondrodysplasia. Because of this, many breeders only breed folds to non-folds to avoid homozygous folds. However, heterozygous folds may also develop osteochondrodysplasia of lesser severity. Australian Curl ‚Äì a curl-eared mutation occurred in a female stray cat in Australia, but was not inherited by her offspring. When the original cat became ill, necessitating spaying, it was impossible to test-mate her sons back to her to identify a possibly recessive curled-ear mutation. Sumxu or Chinese Lop-Eared Cat ‚Äì extinct Chinese Lop-eared cat breed reported between 1700 and 1938 around Peking, most descriptions are based on a specimen in a German museum. The mode of inheritance of its pendulous ears is not known (the name Sumxu results from mistranslations and actually refers to a variety of marten). Four ears ‚Äì a recessive mutation that produced four pinnae or ear flaps (the additional pinnae did not lead to additional ear canals and organs of hearing). In a group of four-eared cats studied in 1957, in addition to duplicated ears, the eyes were reduced in size, the jaw was slightly undershot and the cats were relatively inactive and lethargic. Researchers believed that the functioning of the brain was affected. Breeding data indicated it was most often lethal with kittens dying in utero. The majority of recently reported four-eared cats have been healthy with various ear configurations suggesting other genes were involved or developmental abnormalities rather than hereditary factors. Rounded Ears - a rounded ears mutation occurred in a cat in Italy and is being assessed for breed potential. A similar mutation occurred among free-roaming cats in Texas, but died out. The ears have a rounded, rather than pointed, shape. Size A germ-cell mutation occurred in a male Persian cat called Treker in 1995, resulting in diminutive, but healthy and normally-proportioned, offspring. Treker and the females with which he was mated were normally sized, but 75% of the kittens sired by Treker inherited diminutive stature, but of normal proportions. The gene was found to be dominant and the diminutive offspring were sold as teacup or toy Persians. Teacup/Toy Persians are a separate breed and not all cats advertised under those names result from Treker's dominant mutation. Most teacup and toy size Persian kittens raised now are descendants from Silver and Golden color division to reduce cat size and are in no way related to Treker.

The original fort was built in 1777, but the present fortification was built between 1839 and 1852. The site lies adjacent to the Coast Guard Station New London and is managed as the 16-acre Fort Trumbull State Park by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. History In 1775, Governor Jonathan Trumbull recommended building a fortification at the port of New London to protect the seat of the government of Connecticut. The fort was built on a rocky point of land near the mouth of the Thames River on Long Island Sound; it was completed in 1777 and named for Governor Trumbull, who served from 1769 to 1784. It was attacked in 1781 during the American Revolutionary War, and was captured by British forces under the command of Benedict Arnold. =Arnold's raid= Benedict Arnold had changed his allegiances by this time, and he was serving as a brigadier general in the British Army when he led a raid on Groton and New London, Connecticut on September 6, 1781. Two bodies of troops were landed on either side of the mouth of the Thames River and marched towards Fort Trumbull in New London and Fort Griswold in Groton. Fort Trumbull fell after little resistance, but about 150 Connecticut militiamen made a gallant stand at Fort Griswold in the Battle of Groton Heights. The British were finally able to enter the fort, and militia commander Lieutenant Colonel William Ledyard offered his sword to Major Bromfield, the British commander on the scene, as a token of surrender. According to contemporaneous accounts, Bromfield took the sword from Ledyard and drove it through him, and the British then proceeded to massacre the surviving defenders. Eighty-five of the militiamen were killed and the others were either severely wounded, taken prisoner, or managed to escape. After the capture of both forts, the British proceeded to burn New London and then returned to their ships. An account of the battle published in a Philadelphia newspaper follows: > \\\\- Extract of a letter from New London, dated Sept. 12. > Arnold had long promised to visit New London and the neighbouring towns on > the sea shore, and the enemy having frequently appeared in sight of the > harbour, the alarm guns fired on the present occasion were considered by the > country around us the salutes of prizes or other vessels belonging to the > port.

Secretary of War Henry Dearborn's report on fortifications for December 1811 describes the fort as \\"an irregular enclosed work of masonry and sod, mounting 18 heavy guns [with] a brick barracks for one company\\".Wade, p. 243 The present fortification replaced the older fort, and was built between 1839 and 1852 as a five-sided, four-bastion coastal defense fort. It could accommodate 42 guns on the seacoast fronts, plus 10 additional guns in two flanking batteries outside the fort, along with flank howitzers in bastions for close-in defense.Weaver, pp. 132-135 The new fort was built under the supervision of Army engineer George Washington Cullum, who later served as superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. During the Civil War, Fort Trumbull served as an organizational center for Union troops and headquarters for the 14th US Infantry Regiment. Here, troops were recruited and trained before being sent to war. Fort Trumbull was briefly commanded by John F. Reynolds, who rose to the rank of major general and was killed at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. From 1863 to 1879, Ordnance Sergeant Mark Wentworth Smith was assigned to Fort Trumbull and served as the caretaker of Fort Griswold, which was an un- garrisoned subpost of Fort Trumbull across the Thames River in the town of Groton. Among other duties, he maintained a vegetable garden to help feed the soldiers at Fort Trumbull. Smith was born in New Hampshire in 1803 and enlisted in the Army on January 27, 1827 at the age of 23. He was wounded in action at the Battle of Chapultepec during the Mexican War. For unknown reasons, he was allowed to serve on active duty in the Army until his death in 1879 at the age of 76. He was possibly the oldest enlisted man to serve on active duty in the United States Army in the 19th Century. (Army Air Forces Master Sergeant John W. Westervelt served on active duty during World War II until he was retired at age 77 in 1945. Chief Torpedoman's Mate Harry S. Morris was born in 1888 and served in the Navy from 1903 to 1958 when he was \\"only\\" 70 years old.) Sergeant Smith is buried in the Colonel Ledyard Cemetery in Groton. In the late 1800s Fort Trumbull was modified to accommodate more modern artillery pieces. Specifically, these artillery pieces were 15-inch and 10-inch Rodman smooth bore guns and 8-inch converted rifles. Two 8-inch converted rifles are still at Fort Trumbull in a restored firing position. =20th century=Coast Guard Academy Fort Trumbull today After the Civil War, Fort Trumbull was improved by having more modern artillery pieces installed. In the early 1900s, several more modern Endicott era fortifications were built to defend Long Island Sound as the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound, including Fort Mansfield in Watch Hill, Rhode Island, Fort H.G. Wright on Fishers Island, and Fort Michie on Great Gull Island. Fort Trumbull served as the headquarters of these forts until it was turned over to the Revenue Cutter Service (later renamed the Coast Guard) in 1910 for use as the Revenue Cutter Academy, which was renamed the United States Coast Guard Academy in 1915. The Academy moved to its current location about two miles up the Thames River in 1932. Education facility Fort Trumbull served as the Merchant Marine Officers Training School from 1939 to 1946 and trained over 15,000 of the Merchant Marine officers who served during the Second World War. One of the Merchant Marine officers trained there was actor Jack Lord, who is best known for playing Steve McGarrett on the popular TV series Hawaii Five-O in the 1960s and 70s.Fort Trumbull History Site The Fort was the site of a satellite campus of the University of Connecticut from 1946 to 1950, educating war veterans attending college under the GI Bill. Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory During World War II, Fort Trumbull hosted an office of Columbia University's Division of War Research, which developed passive sonar systems. By 1946, this was consolidated with Harvard University's Underwater Sound Laboratory at Fort Trumbull.Sherman, Charles H. and Butler, John L., Transducers and Arrays for Underwater Sound, pp.7-8, Springer, 2007 . A result of this work was that Fort Trumbull was the location for the Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory from 1946 to 1970, which developed sonar and related systems for US Navy submarines. In 1970, the Sound Laboratory was merged with the Naval Underwater Weapons Systems Center (NUWS) to form the Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC) in Newport, Rhode Island. Work continued at both locations until the facility at Fort Trumbull was finally closed in 1996, marking the end of almost a century and a half of Fort Trumbull's service as a federal military facility.

It is used as a site for concerts and other special events. The main fort is open to the public and has an elevator to access the upper portions of the fort. There is a museum about the fort in the former officers' quarters.

Zakharov was elected as an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian Senate in 1983. Former Senator Graham Richardson, a leader of the party's right faction, once stated that Zakharov \\"[worked] hard on social issues in the chamber, but [hid] her light under a bushel far too successfully\\". She was re-elected in 1984, 1987, and 1993, and was in the midst of her final term in the Senate when she was killed in an automobile accident in early 1995. Before politics Zakharov was born Alice Olive Hay, in Kew, Melbourne. She studied psychology as part of an arts degree at Melbourne University, where she joined the local branch of the Communist Party of Australia, something which she later discovered had brought her to the attention of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. She briefly married while at university, but the couple separated in 1949, and she soon moved to Yallourn to live with a new partner, unionist John Zakharov, who she later married and began a family with. As a young woman, she juggled her family commitments with a number of jobs, working as a market research interviewer, clerk, waitress, mail officer, psychiatric nurse, and pathology assistant. She also continued to be politically active, being involved in the local branch of the Australian Labor Party. In 1968, after the last of her children had reached primary school, Zakharov separated from her husband, and later divorced him, though she retained his surname. She proceeded to raise her children alone, and in 1969 began as a student welfare co-ordinator at Montmorency Secondary College in Melbourne. She served as president of her local party branch, and was a delegate to the party's state conference. She was offered a safe Labor seat in the Parliament of Victoria in the 1970s, but declined for family reasons. Senate career Zakharov subsequently sought preselection to run as a Labor Senate candidate in Victoria at the double dissolution 1983 federal election. She received the fifth position on the Labor ticket, and easily swept into parliament in the landslide Labor victory, taking the final position well ahead of her nearest rival, Democrat John Siddons. She soon established herself as a loyal member of the Socialist Left faction and as an advocate for equal rights for women and the rights of the disadvantaged. This early advocacy for progressive causes brought her the second ever Australian Humanist of the Year award in 1984. Due to having won the tenth spot in 1983, Zakharov was forced to face election against the following year, but was once again comfortably returned. Once asked why she had begun a political career so late in life, Zakharov compared herself to marathon runner Cliff Young and stated, \\"Late runs can be very successful.\\" Throughout the 1980s, Zakharov remained a loyal member of the party, but made her voice heard on a number of issues. She was the lone voice of dissent when the other five members of the Senate Select Committee on Video Material urged the banning of X-rated videos in 1984. Two years later, Zakharov and Senator Rosemary Crowley opposed legislation against scientific experimentation on human embryos that had been proposed by conservative independent Brian Harradine. The remainder of the select committee set up to evaluate the proposal supported a compromise majority report that severely limited scientific experimentation; in a high-profile dissenting report, Zakharov and Crowley urged that the parents of the embryos have the final say as to how they were used, and were highly critical of the absolute pro-life arguments employed by the majority. While the report was overlooked by the government at the time, it was later largely adopted by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission. Zakharov also remained involved in her local community; she used her political connections to help save her historic neighbourhood in Port Melbourne from demolition, and at one point painted \\"NOT FOR SALE\\" on her roof in order to promote the message. In 1988, Zakharov was the only 1st world politician invited to witness the first destruction of nuclear weapons at a ceremony in the Soviet Union after the signing of a disarmament agreement. Upon returning from the USSR, she described the occasion as \\"the chance of a thousand lifetimes\\". Four years later, she joined a crossbench group (along with Labor's Chris Schacht, Bruce Childs and Margaret Reynolds and the Liberal Party's Baden Teague) to become involved in the international campaign to free jailed Israeli scientist Mordechai Vanunu. While Zakharov did speak out on several key issues, she remained bound by the principles of party discipline. In 1988, she was critical of the proposals that became the Higher Education Contribution Scheme while they were in caucus, although she promptly dropped the matter when the majority supported the changes. This again occurred with planned price increases to various Medicare services in 1992, when Zakharov used her position as chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs to cut committee hearings short, to the chagrin of the opposition parties. She did, however, manage to win some small concessions through the committee's final report, and somewhat embarrassed Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe in the process. One of the strangest moments in Zakharov's career occurred in late 1990, when, as a member of the parliamentary Australian Security Intelligence Organisation committee, she was given access to her own intelligence file. She was not surprised to discover that ASIO had shown interest in her membership of the Communist Party while at university; what she was not prepared for was a detailed investigation the organisation had made in 1963, after becoming concerned that John Zakharov was a bigamist. A less-than-impressed Zakharov speculated at the time that the contents of her file may have cost her at least one public service position during the 1970s. In June 1992, the Labor Party proposed legalising the entry of gay and lesbian people into the armed forces. Zakharov had always been a strong supporter of gay rights, and successfully nominated for the investigating committee. The proposed changes were strongly opposed by then-Defence Minister Robert Ray and later Opposition Leader Kim Beazley. Zakharov helped push the proposals through caucus, to see them become law not long afterwards. She also publicly opposed discrimination against gay parents. In the leadup to the 1993 federal election, there was some speculation that Zakharov would be dropped from the Labor ticket due to her mild manner and low media profile. She lost the second position on the ticket to factional powerbroker Kim Carr, but secured the third position against several challengers, including former lower house MP David McKenzie. Labor was not expected to do well at the election, and it was thought that Zakharov was likely to lose, just as Carr had done from the same position at the 1990 election. However, she retained her seat, fending off challenges from Democrat-turned-independent Janet Powell and Nuclear Disarmament Party-turned-Democrat Robert Wood in the general election. In November 1993, Zakharov publicly revealed that she had been a victim of domestic violence at the hands of her deceased husband for ten years prior to their separation. She launched the government's Campaign to Stop Violence Against Women, and urged other victims and their neighbours to speak up. She said at the time that she had kept silent because \\"There were no alternatives. There were no refuges for women, no supporting parent's benefit and almost no child care. I made the break when my youngest was old enough to go to school so I could work.\\" Death Zakharov was struck by a car on the afternoon of 12 February 1995, while crossing St Kilda road after leaving the Midsumma gay and lesbian festival. She lay in a coma for more than a month, but did not regain consciousness. While she was in hospital, the Coalition arranged a pair, so as not to take advantage of Zakharov's injuries in a closely divided Senate. Having never regained consciousness, Zakharov died on 6 March. No charges were laid regarding the accident. She was the first woman Senator to die in office. Upon her death, the Senate adjourned early and several red roses, the symbol of the international socialist movement, were placed upon her desk as a mark of respect. More than two hours of condolence speeches were delivered in parliament, and after her funeral on 30 March, a memorial plaque was unveiled in the courtyard at Parliament House. Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe attempted to convince the state Kennett government to save the historic Missions to Seamen building in Port Melbourne, which Zakharov had been fighting to save, as a memorial to her, but was unsuccessful. A memorial to her in a park in Bay Street, Port Melbourne was unveiled in March 2002.

BiographyEarly life= Khizar was born at Chak Muzaffarabad, in the district of Sargodha, Punjab in 1900. He was born into the Rajput Tiwana family of ShahpurSir Roper Lethbridge, The Golden Book of India: A Genealogical and Biographical Dictionary of the Ruling Princes, Chiefs, Nobles, and Other Personages, Titled Or Decorated of the Indian Empire, Aakar Books, 1893 and his father Sir Umar Hayat Khan was a wealthy landowner and soldier who was an elected member of the Council of the Secretary of State for India. He was educated at Aitchison College in Lahore.Ian Talbot, Khizr Tiwana, the Punjab Unionist Party and the Partition of India, Routledge, 16 December 2013, p. i. =Military career= At the age of 16 he volunteered for war service and was commissioned to the 17th Cavalry as a temporary honorary second lieutenant in the Indian Land Forces on 17 April 1918.London Gazette, 15 November 1918 In addition to his brief World War I service, Khizar also briefly served in the Third Anglo-Afghan War which followed, earning a mention in dispatches. He was advanced to honorary second lieutenant on 21 November 1919,London Gazette, 10 February 1920 and was promoted to the honorary rank of captain on 17 April 1923.London Gazette, 19 September 1924 Khizar thereafter assisted his father in the management of the family estates in the Punjab, taking responsibility for them while his father was in London. He was promoted to honorary Major on 17 April 1936London Gazette, 19 June 1936 and was promoted to honorary lieutenant-colonel on 12 January 1943.London Gazette, 12 January 1943 =Entry into politics= Khizar was elected to the Punjab Legislative Assembly in 1937. He immediately joined the cabinet of Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan as Minister of Public Works and Local Self Government.Ian Talbot, Khizr Tiwana, the Punjab Unionist Party and the Partition of India, Routledge, 16 December 2013, p. 70. Khizar lacked public speaking skills and administrative experience and obtained the position largely through his father's reputation and the standing of his family. Despite this, he became a trusted member of the cabinet and was entrusted with the home portfolio responsible for dealing with the police and law and order. At the outbreak of the Second World War he had been placed in charge of the Manpower Committee of the Punjab War Board and the Civil Defence Departments. In 1940 he was responsible for handling the Unionist Party's dealings with the Allama Mashriqi and for arranging security at the All-India Muslim League sessions in Lahore. His achievements included overseeing reform of the panchayat system by extending their administrative, fiscal and judicial functions, and ensuring improvements to infrastructure and irrigation networks.Ian Talbot, Khizr Tiwana, the Punjab Unionist Party and the Partition of India, Routledge, 16 December 2013, p. 76. He steadfastly supported the Unionist pro-agricultural policies, and sympathised with their endeavours to promote communal harmony. =Premier of the Punjab= Punjab, with Sikh leader Master Tara Singh (centre), and Mohammad Ali Jinnah, leader of the All India Muslim League at the Simla Conference called by viceroy Lord Wavell in June 1945. In 1942 Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan unexpectedly died creating a vacancy as Premier. The position was eyed by the three dominant Muslim factions, the Noon-Tiwana, Daultanas and the Hayats.Ayesha Jalal, The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan, Cambridge University Press, 1994. Khizar was unanimously selected as his successor on 23 January 1943. Khizar assumed control during the height of the Second World War. Many Punjabi soldiers had been killed, others returned maimed, and demobilised soldiers were not being immediately allotted parcels of land in the canal colonies. To feed Bengalis suffering the Bengal famine of 1943, the central government in Delhi instructed Khizar's government to introduce rationing in the Punjab and fix grain prices which in turn affected landowner's financially.Mehtab Ali Shah, The Foreign Policy of Pakistan: Ethnic Impacts on Diplomacy 1971-1994, I.B. Tauris, 15 November 1997, p. 131. A war weariness descended over the Punjab, and food shortages, fixed prices, and their support for conscription, damaged attitudes towards Khizar's government from rich and poor Muslim alike. Like Sikandar, Khizar was staunchly opposed to the idea of Pakistan, yet unlike his predecessor was less willing to compromise or bow to Jinnah's dictation.Penderel Moon, Divide and Quit, University of California Press, 1962, p. 39. Jinnah increasingly sought to enforce the Sikandar-Jinnah pact and wield influence over the government claiming that as the Muslims of the Unionist party also belonged to the Muslim League, the Punjab government was a League government and should submit to directives of the Muslim League leadership. In April 1944 Jinnah demanded that the name of the Unionist Party be changed to the Muslim League Coalition Party.Hardy, The Muslims of British India, CUP Archive, 7 December 1972, p. 234. Khizar rebuffed these demands asserting that his government was a coalition with Hindus and Sikhs, rather than a Muslim League government Tension with Jinnah simmered until Khizar was expelled from the Muslim League later that year. This opened a rift within the Unionist Party, with Muslim members now forced to choose between Khizar and the Muslim League. Following this clash, the Muslim League waged an increasing vitriolic campaign against him, denouncing him as a 'quisling' and 'kafir'. Mock funerals were held outside his official residence and he was greeted wherever he went with black flags of protest.Ian Talbot, Khizr Tiwana, the Punjab Unionist Party and the Partition of India, Routledge, 16 December 2013. Khizar suffered a further blow in January 1945 with the death of Sir Chhottu Ram. Ram was the leader of the Hindu Jats in south eastern Punjab, a pillar of the Unionist Party and greatly respected by Muslims in the province. Jinnah increased the pressure on Khizar at the Simla Conference of 1945. Convened by the Viceroy of India Lord Wavell, the conference was to put together an interim government in India following the war. Jinnah insisted that any Muslim nominee to the government must be selected by the Muslim League, as only they spoke for the entirety of Muslims in India. This was seen as an attempt to undermine the influence of the Unionist Party, and its ability to represent its Muslim constituency. In September 1945, Sir Feroz Khan Noon, a member of the Noon-Tiwana faction, resigned from the Unionist party and urged Khizar and other Unionists to join the Muslim League. Noon had previously been a key ally for Khizar, assuring him that he would help heal his rift with Jinnah and urging him to not divide the Punjabi Muslims - the heart of Muslim India.Firoz Khan Noon to Khizar Hayat Khan, 21 August 1945, SHC/Punjab vol. IV, 15. Noon's defection opened the gates for further defections from the party. Other defectors included Sikandar's son, Shaukat Hayat Khan and Mumtaz Daultana, who both realigned their families support towards the Muslim League. At the Indian provincial elections of 1946, the Muslim League won seventy nine seats to the Punjab Assembly, and reduced the Unionists to just ten. Despite this crushing defeat for Khizar and the Unionists, the Muslim League were unable to form a government as they lacked an absolute majority. Khizar struck a deal with the Congress Party and Akali Dal and was invited to form a coalition government. His cabinet included Sir Muzaffar Ali Khan Qizilbash, Bhim Sen Sachar and Baldev Singh.J. Henry Korson, Contemporary Problems of Pakistan, Brill Archive, 1974, p. 20. The coalition proved a disaster, as for the first time a predominately non-Muslim government held power. From the outset the Muslim League organised a programme of civil disobedience and disruption to the province.J. Henry Korson, Contemporary Problems of Pakistan, Brill Archive, 1974, p. 19. The Muslim League argued it was an example of Hindu connivance to defeat the interests of the Muslim community.Penderel Moon, Divide and Quit, University of California Press, 1962, p. 72. Khizar was portrayed as a traitor, clinging to power and office without regard for the interests of the Muslims. Khizar remained opposed to the partition of India to the end. He felt that Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus of the Punjab all had a common culture and was against dividing India to create a religious segregation between the same people. Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, himself a Muslim, remarked to the separatist leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah: \\"There are Hindu and Sikh Tiwanas who are my relatives. I go to their weddings and other ceremonies. How can I possibly regard them as coming from another nation?\\" He refused to accept the two-nation theory, and believed that a Muslim majority government in the Punjab would be an important guarantee of the rights of Muslims in a minority province. Tiwana advocated for amity between the religious communities of undivided India, proclaiming March 1st as Communal Harmony Day and aiding in the establishment of a Communal Harmony Committee in Lahore presided over by Raja Narendra Nath with its secretary being Maulvi Mahomed Ilyas of Bahawalpur. As a last ditch attempt to avoid partition, Khizar attempted to convince the British to accept his proposal for an independent Punjabi state, a separate entity to both India and Pakistan.Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech, The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies, OUP Oxford, 27 March 2014, p. 486. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India in the 1946 New Year Honours and was a member of the Indian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in the summer of 1946. Due to the boycotts engulfing the Punjab, he resigned as Premier on 2 March 1947. Sir Evan Jenkins, as Governor of the Punjab assumed direct control of the Punjab until the day of partition, 14 August 1947. =Later life= He retired from politics following his resignation, and lived for a time in Simla and Delhi following independence.

In 1954, Daultana would confiscate all the private canals owned by Khizar under the guise of the Punjab Minor Canals Bill. In his final visit to the United States, Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, reflecting on the creation of Bangladesh, echoed his opposition to the partition of India, particularly the division of the Punjab Province, stating: \\"I still think a Punjabi Muslim has more in common with a Punjabi Hindu or Sikh than with a Bengali (or any non-Punjabi really) and I think the separation of East Pakistan proved that.\\" He died in Butte City, California, on 20 January 1975.https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/25/archives/nawab-tiwana-exminister-of- punjab-led-unionists.html  References  Further reading  * Khizr Tiwana, Ian Talbot, Oxford University Press, c 2002 Category:Aitchison College alumni Category:People of the Third Anglo-Afghan War Tiwana, Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, Malik Khizar Hayat Category:Indian knights Category:1900 births Category:1975 deaths Category:History of Punjab Malik Kh Category:People of British India Category:Punjab MPAs 1947‚Äì1949 ","title":"Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana"},{"id":"2742444","text":"Lora Ottenad (born February 3, 1964) is a professional female bodybuilder from Las Vegas, Nevada.

The station is owned and operated by the Salem Media Group. History The station is one of the five original Pittsburgh stations, signing on May 4, 1922 as WCAE. It was originally owned by the Pittsburgh department store Kaufmann & Baer's, and operated at 833 kHz (as all stations did at that time); it moved to 750 kHz in December and to 650 in May 1923. Kaufmann and Baer's was purchased in 1925 by Gimbels; this made WCAE the company's third radio station, after WIP in Philadelphia and WGBS in New York City. The station became an affiliate of the NBC Red Network in January 1927. It moved to 560 kHz on June 15, 1927, but in November returned to 650; a year later, WCAE moved to 1220 kHz WCAE was acquired by Hearst Corporation in 1931. The North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement moved the station to 1250 kHz on March 29, 1941; on November 1, it became a full-time affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System (which previously aired on both WCAE and KQV), with NBC Red moving to KDKA. Another affiliation change took place on June 15, 1945, when WCAE swapped affiliations with KQV and joined the Blue Network, which changed its name to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) that same day. An FM sister station at 96.1 MHz was started in 1948; WCAE-FM was shut down in 1953, but was restarted August 8, 1960. WCAE lost the ABC affiliation to WJAS on May 21, 1955. The station expanded into television three years later, with the debut of WTAE (channel 4) on September 4, 1958, initially as a joint venture of Hearst and the former owners of KQV; this arrangement had led to the sale of KQV to ABC in 1957 to avoid duopoly concerns. WCAE began stunting on May 27, 1961, promoting a new format to begin two days later; at that time, the station changed its call letters to WRYT and began playing beautiful music. Another call letter change occurred five years later, when the station became WTAE to match its television sister station (which had become wholly owned by Hearst by this time); soon afterward, the station shifted to a middle-of-the-road format. WTAE shifted its format again in 1973, this time to an oldies-heavy adult contemporary format under general manager Ted Atkins, who used programming techniques he had learned from Bill Drake at KHJ in Los Angeles. The widely popular morning show, O'Brien & Garry, featured Larry O'Brien and John Garry doing comedy skits, playing music, and other general morning fare. The format proved successful ‚Äî by 1980, WTAE had become the number-two station in Pittsburgh, trailing only KDKA. The station also had a heavy sports commitment; it became the flagship station of the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1969, and around the same time became the home of the Pittsburgh Panthers. WTAE also aired a nightly sports show, hosted for many years by Myron Cope. The station also added an affiliation with ABC's Entertainment Network by 1976. In 1987, as at many AM radio stations, music was abandoned, and WTAE became a talk station. Hosts included Jack Bogut, Lynn Cullen, Doug Hoerth and Phil Musick. After 66 years of ownership, Hearst sold WTAE, along with what had become WVTY (now WKST-FM), to SFX Broadcasting in 1997. That December 1, SFX relaunched WTAE as an all-sports station. Chancellor Media bought SFX's Pittsburgh stations a year later, and then traded WTAE to Jacor Communications in exchange for WKNR in Cleveland, Ohio in August 1998. Jacor changed the call letters to WEAE to disassociate the station from WTAE-TV, which remained owned by Hearst-Argyle. Soon afterward, Jacor put the station up for sale, and in 1999, WEAE was acquired by ABC, which affiliated the station with its ESPN Radio network. ESPN programming such as Mike and Mike in the Morning was supplemented by local sports talkers Scott Paulsen, Mike Logan, Chris Mack, Guy Junker, Stan Savran, and Stillers 365 (with Ken Laird). Mark Madden was a host on the station from 1998 until his firing in May 2008 for making an on- air remark that he wished that Sen. Edward Kennedy be assassinated.\\"Madden removed from air by ESPN,\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 28, 2008 Madden returned to the Pittsburgh airwaves on October 13, 2008, with an afternoon drive show on competitor WXDX, which is otherwise a modern rock station. WEAE's final logo as \\"1250 ESPN\\", used from 2008 until December 31, 2010 Soon after the sale to ABC, WEAE lost the Steelers rights to WDVE (itself formerly owned by ABC) and WWSW (now WBGG) after nearly thirty years; a year earlier, WTAE had lost the Pittsburgh Panthers to KQV. The station subsequently picked up the Penn State Nittany Lions. WDDZ's logo as \\"Radio Disney AM 1250\\", used from 2011 until 2013 Although WEAE was generally the top-rated sports station in Pittsburgh, ahead of WBGG, it was a financial failure (at one point losing as much as $2 million)‚Äîa problem that only worsened when KDKA-FM was launched as an FM sports station and wooed away some of WEAE's advertisers. After attempts to sell the station ended without a buyer, ABC decided to not renew its lease of WWCS, which it had run as Pittsburgh's Radio Disney affiliate, upon its expiration on December 31, 2010, and move Radio Disney to WEAE, with WBGG assuming the ESPN Radio affiliation and Penn State men's basketball moving to KQV. Local programming was largely canceled on September 25, 2010. When the format change occurred on January 1, 2011, the call letters were changed to WDDZ (which were transferred from a former Radio Disney affiliate in Providence, Rhode Island). On August 13, 2014, Disney put WDDZ and twenty- two other Radio Disney stations up for sale, in order to focus more on digital distribution of the Radio Disney network. Disney originally planned to temporarily shut down the station on September 26, 2014. However, Disney changed their plans at the last minute, and all stations remained on the air and continued carrying Radio Disney programming until they were sold. On February 25, 2015, Sports Radio Group (the Disney subsidiary that held the station's license) filed to sell WDDZ to the Pennsylvania Media Associates, Inc., a subsidiary of the Salem Media Group. Salem bought the station for $1 million. Following the sale's completion, Salem introduced its \\"Answer\\" conservative talk format on the station on May 13.Fybush, Scott (February 25, 2015).

The series was produced by J.C.Staff and directed by Shinichi Watanabe and premiered on TV Tokyo on October 7, 1999. The series ran for twenty-six episodes until its conclusion on March 30, 2000. At the publisher's request, the anime series follows a different storyline from the manga; Rikdo was pleased with the adaptation. To balance the removal of Rikudou's original material, Watanabe added his own alter ego, Nabeshin, and expanded several elements, including increasing Pedro's role and expanding on the concept of the Great Will. The twenty-sixth episode, \\"Going Too Far\\", never aired in Excel Saga's original run on TV Tokyo because it was purposefully too violent and obscene for broadcast in Japan. The series is licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by ADV Films, and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. The ADV Films English dub of the series was aired on the Anime Network in the United States, and on the Sci Fi Channel and Rapture TV in the United Kingdom. In North America, ADV released the series on six DVDs between June 11, 2002 and April 8, 2003.

The station briefly served as the area's CBS affiliate.  History  The station first signed on the air on April 16, 1984, operating as an independent station. WNHT initially ran a business news format during the day and a general entertainment format featuring off-network sitcoms, drama series and movies at night. Business news programming was dropped in the fall of 1985, and WNHT ran a full-time general entertainment schedule in competition with WNDS (channel 50, now WWJE-DT). The station's programming consisted of drama series, movies, first-run syndicated shows, and sitcoms by this time, but did not feature cartoons as many other independents did.bostonradio.org: \\"Re: WNHT's fatal error\\", March 21, 1998. After just three months, the original owners sold WNHT to The Flatley Company, a broadcaster owned by Boston real estate developer Thomas Flatley.bostonradio.org: \\"Re: WNHT's fatal error\\" (followup), March 22, 1998. Unfortunately, the station's ratings were very low, so by 1986 the station moved into a more traditional independent schedule, adding a few cartoons to the lineup. By then, ratings were decent and the station became profitable. Manchester is from Boston, while Concord is about from that city. While southern New Hampshire is considered to be part of the Boston market, it had (and still does have) its own ABC station, WMUR-TV (channel 9). Boston VHF stations had grade A signals in Manchester and Grade B signals in Concord, while the UHF stations had grade B signals in Manchester but spotty signals in Concord. It was thought that the Manchester/Concord/Portsmouth region could break away from Boston and become its own television market. At the start of 1988, this area had its own ABC station, WNDS, WNHT, PBS member station WENH- TV (channel 11, part of New Hampshire Public Television), and WGOT (channel 60, now WNEU) which had just begun operation. If this area were to break away from Boston, it would rank in the top 100 of all U.S. television markets. After much research, it was thought that the area needed a CBS affiliate. With that in mind, WNHT became affiliated with CBS on February 1, 1988. Except for Star Trek, off-network syndicated reruns disappeared from the schedule, while first-run talk shows like Donahue and The Oprah Winfrey Show remained. On May 28, WNHT established a news department and began airing local newscasts at 6:30 a.m., 12 noon, 5, 6 and 11 p.m. However, the station failed to lure local CBS viewers away from WNEV (channel 7, now independent station WHDH) and Portland, Maine's WGME-TV, two established CBS stations in the neighboring markets which both reached Concord even without cable coverage. The cable systems in southeastern New Hampshire carried WNHT, while the systems in western and northern New Hampshire did not. Cable providers also carried at least WNEV, while many others also carried WGME, with cable systems in northern New Hampshire carrying WGME and/or WCAX-TV from Burlington, Vermont. Worse, there were no syndication exclusivity or must-carry laws compelling cable providers to black out the other CBS affiliates. Even if there were, WNEV still would have been receivable over-the-air in Concord through its grade B signal in the area. With ratings continuing to disappoint, at the end of 1988 the station laid off some staffers in hopes of cutting payroll. By March 1989, the morning, midday and 5 p.m. newscasts were canceled, leaving only the 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts. Even those moves did not make WNHT more profitable. On March 31, 1989, Flatley informed station staff in a meeting that the station would go off the air at midnight that night due to its continuing poor ratings and financial problems. According to an article in the Union-Leader newspaper, Flatley compared this decision to the one where he had to euthanize his terminally ill German shepherd. That afternoon, viewers started seeing this message on the bottom of the screen: \\"IT IS WITH REGRET THAT WE ANNOUNCE THAT WNHT WILL BE LEAVING THE AIR PERMANENTLY TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT.\\" That night, the station's newscasts were replaced by reruns of Three's Company. As stated, WNHT went off the air at midnight, even though Pat Sajak's talk show was still on the air at that moment.

It was built in 1765 by Roger Morris, a British military officer, and served as a headquarters for both sides in the American Revolution. Located at 65 Jumel Terrace, in Roger Morris Park in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, it is the oldest house in the borough. The home and grounds were purchased as a museum home in 1903 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961. With The exterior was designated a New York City Landmark in 1967, with the interior following in 1975. HistoryMorris ownership= Roger Morris, a British military officer who was serving as a member of the Executive Council of the Province of New York, built the house in 1765 for himself and his American-born wife, Mary Philipse Morris; they lived in it for ten years, from 1765 until 1775, when the American Revolution began. Roger Morris held the position of captain in the British army during the French war, while his wife, Mary Phillipse, was daughter to speaker of the assembly Frederick Philipse. She was often described as \\" beautiful, fascinating, and accomplished.\\" As British loyalists, Morris went to England at the start of the war, while his wife and family went to stay at the Philipse estate in Yonkers.\\"Morris-Jumel Mansion Interior DesignationReport New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (May 27, 1975) Morris returned in 1777, after the city had been captured by the British, and became the Inspector of the Claims of Refugees until 1783, when he and his family left for England after the British defeat in the Revolution. Between September 14 and October 20, 1776, General George Washington used the mansion as his temporary headquarters after his army was forced to evacuate Brooklyn Heights following their loss to the British Army under the command of General William Howe in the Battle of Long Island. During his stay there from September 14 to October 20, 1776, Washington made note of his experience there. It is claimed without foundation by those with a romantic inclination that Washington not only selected the house because of its location but also because Mary Philipse had been a love interest for him twenty years before. The house is one of the major remaining landmarks of Battle of Harlem Heights, after which it became the headquarters of British Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton, and the Hessian commander Baron Wilhelm von Knyphausen. =Confiscation= Because the Morrises were Loyalists, the house and the Morris' jointly held one-third share of the massive Philipse Patent immediately north of today's Westchester County border were confiscated in 1779 by the Revolutionary government of the Colony of New York's Commissioners of Forfeiture. They were sold off during the dark times of the Revolution for the Colonials to fund its Continental Army led by Washington. Despite assurance of restitution in the 1783 Treaty of Paris Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture no compensation to the Morrises was ever forthcoming from either the state of New York or American government. Following its confiscation Mt. Morris served as a farmhouse and a tavern, \\"Calumet Hall\\", a popular stop along the Albany Post Road. =Jumel purchase= Palladian style mansion built by Morris in northern Manhattan in 1765, the family home until the onset of the American Revolution in 1775. Seen here in 1892, after it had been altered with a Federal style entrance. The mansion was bought in 1810 by Stephen Jumel, a rich French merchant who had immigrated to the United States, as a home for himself and his wife, and former mistress, Eliza Bowen Jumel, along with their adopted daughter Mary Bowen, who was thought to be the daughter of Eliza's stepsister.\\"Places Where Women Made History: the Morris-Jumel Mansion\\" on the National Park Service website Throughout her adult life, Eliza Jumel lived richly and luxuriously. Eliza, who had come from poor beginnings, was known for being a woman who sought out a higher social position for herself as well as a life that encompassed having large amounts of wealth. Thus, she was always seen around men of power and fortune. Anxious to be accepted into New York society, the Jumels remodeled the house, adding the Federal style entrance, and redecorated the interior in the Empire style. Because they were not accepted socially in New York, the Jumels went to France in 1815, although Eliza returned from 1817‚Äì1821. She returned for good in 1826 with Stephen Jumel's power of attorney, and he returned in 1828. Eliza was subject to many accusations in both France and New York, one of them being her involvement in the unpleasant death of her first husband. After Stephen's death in 1832 from injuries he received in a carriage accident, Eliza, who was now one of the wealthiest women in New York City, married the controversial ex-vice president Aaron Burr in the front parlor of the house; she filed for divorce in 1834, which was granted in 1836, shortly before his death. Eliza then divided her time between Saratoga, New York, Hoboken, New Jersey and lower Manhattan. Her step-daughter's family lived with her in the mansion until 1862; Eliza Jumel died in 1865 ‚Äì in her later years she became very eccentric, if not insane. The care and love she had for the mansion helped it evolve into the representation of art and culture it has been for over two and one-half centuries within the New York City area. In 1882, the Jumel heirs broke up the of the estate into 1058 lots, upon which numerous row houses were built, some of which today make up the Jumel Terrace Historic District. =As a museum home= The mansion overlooking the Polo Grounds, 1905 The house itself was purchased by New York City in 1903 from the owners at the time, the Earles, with the help of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and converted into a museum run by the Washington Headquarters Association; The museum opened in 1904, and was renovated and refurnished in 1945. The house is owned by the Department of Parks and Recreation, and is a member of the Historic House Trust. During its history, the Morris‚ÄìJumel Mansion hosted many other distinguished visitors, including dinner guests John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton and John Quincy Adams. Architecture The interior of the Morris‚ÄìJumel Mansion in 2005 The house was built as a summer villa on a parcel comprising an area of 130 acres. Thus, the Morris property covered some distance from Harlem all the way to the Hudson River. It is an early example of the Palladian style of architecture. Morris, whose uncle was a successful architect in England, was influenced by Palladio, a 16th-century Italian architect.\\"Roger Morris Park\\" on the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation website His design included a double-height portico and triangular pediment - innovative features for 1765 - supported by grand Tuscan columns, and a two-story octagonal room at the rear of the mansion, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the country. The remodeling by the Jumels c.1810 was in the Federal style current at the time, and included the entrance. The house has been said to contain \\"some of the finest Georgian interiors in America.\\" Today, the house is lavishly decorated with period furnishings and careful reproductions of period carpets and wallpaper. It features nine restored rooms, one of which was Washington's office. The dining room and Eliza Jumel's bedchamber, with a bed that supposedly belonged to Napoleon are also open.

It is located behind the Fitten, Freeman, and Montag dorms. The bowl itself is split in two by a sidewalk creating the larger Burger Bowl, adjacent to the SAC fields, and the smaller Taco Bowl, adjacent to Hemphill Avenue. The Burger Bowl was known for its characteristic lack of grass, the prevailing contents of the soil being a mixture of dirt, rocks, and urban debris. The elevated lips that give the green space its bowl-shape lead to the flooding in the field, puddles from heavy rains sometimes leaving the field in a marshy state. In 2010, the bowl was renovated and leveled, and new sod was laid down. The renovation also involved the construction of a network of tunnels beneath the field, commonly known to students as the 'Burger Bowl Catacombs' (BBC). Since then, the Burger bowl has been a fertile , grass- filled landscape for students to gather, play and relax on. History The bowl-shaped field picked up the \\"Burger\\" name during the 1970s, when Burger King opened a restaurant across Hemphill Avenue from the field. The Burger King, which closed in the mid-1980s, was next to the site of former Georgia Governor Lester Maddox's Pickrick Cafeteria. The Burger Bowl was used as a practice area for field events for the 1996 Olympic Games. Following the Olympics, the Atlanta Commission for the Olympic Games (ACOG) had 6 inches of sand placed over the field, and grass sowed in it. This slightly improved drainage of the field, but did nothing to improve grass cover, given the wear and tear it faced as a rugby practice field. Uses The field is currently a recreational field for a variety of intramural athletics, and home to the Georgia Tech Rugby Football Club (a rugby union team). The Bowl also serves as a meeting place for clubs and events, including most Georgia Tech Homecoming and Greek Week events. The field is on a slight grade, so ends of the field are often referred to as uphill or downhill for location purposes. Georgia Tech built the Leadership Challenge Course in the northeast corner.

Much of it consists of dense rows of \\"two up, two down\\" terraced housing built during the late 19th century and early 20th century for dockyard workers and their families. Due to the rising cost of houses in the south in recent years, it has become one of the key areas for first time buyers. The area once included a greyhound racing stadium (closed 2010 April and since has been demolished), Alexandra Park, with the Mountbatten Sports Centre, and Portsmouth International Port. To the north lie Tipner and Hilsea, and to the south are Kingston, Buckland and Commercial Road, the main retail area of the city. Stamshaw is bounded to its west by the M275 motorway and Whale Island, and to the east is North End. The main thoroughfares of Stamshaw are Twyford Avenue and Stamshaw Road, the two parts of a one-way traffic system that runs on a north-south axis to Northern Parade in Hilsea. The local middle school is Stamshaw Junior School, and there is Stamshaw Infant School too. Stamshaw Park is the place where many people spend their free time, as it has large fields and an adventure playground.

The station is owned by Frank Iorio, Jr., through licensee Pittsburgh Radio Partners LLC, and broadcasts at 1320 kHz with a power level of 7,000 watts, from a transmitter located in the Highland Park neighborhood of Pittsburgh. WJAS' studios are located on Fleet Street in Green Tree. History WJAS, which is one of Pittsburgh's five original AM stations, first signed on the air on August 4, 1922 and became an NBC owned-and-operated station in 1957\\"NBC buys WJAS Pittsburgh.\\" Broadcasting - Telecasting, August 12, 1957, pg. 9. (after briefly operating as WAMP in the 1950s). During the 1930s and 1940s, WJAS was home to the Wilkens Amateur Hour. Sponsored by Wilkens Jewelry Company, a 1942 review in the trade publication Billboard said the show \\"remains Pittsburgh's most popular local program.\\" In 1973, the station became extremely popular with a new format as top 40 WKPQ, later WKTQ \\"13Q\\", under new owners Heftel Communications. A promotion was run where listeners would win prizes if they were randomly telephoned and answered with \\"I listen to the new sound of 13Q\\" (instead of \\"hello\\"). Although this was the highest-rated format ever to appear on 1320, ranking second in the ratings to KDKA, it did not last due to the audience's move to FM radio. By 1977, 13Q's fortunes were fading, and Heftel sold the station to Nationwide Communications, who tried adult contemporary, which failed as well. Nationwide later sold the station to Beni Broadcasting, who switched the station to an adult standards format and brought back the WJAS call letters in 1981. Beni eventually sold WJAS to Renda Broadcasting. WJAS was one of the top standards stations in the United States, and would last for the next 3 decades. WJAS boasts of two personalities with long and storied histories in Pittsburgh media: Jack Bogut and Bill \\"Chilly Billy\\" Cardille. In August 2014, Renda Broadcasting sold WJAS to Pittsburgh Radio Partners LLC, a company controlled by Frank Iorio, Jr. The sale, at a price of $1 million, was consummated on August 1, 2014; it is Iorio's first radio station purchase in Pittsburgh, as his other stations were all based in Warren (he put the Warren stations up for sale in 2017, finding a buyer in Lilly Broadcasting in 2019). As expected, at Noon on August 7, 2014, the company then changed the station to a Premiere Networks-affiliated conservative talk format in response to rumors that WPGB would flip formats.\\"WJAS sale finalized; format expected to change\\" Pittsburgh Tribune- Review The final song under the standards format was \\"One More for the Road\\" by Frank Sinatra. WJAS then began carrying most of the programs previously heard on WPGB (a station that directed its listeners to WJAS as it prepared to change formats); the first program to air on the talk-formatted WJAS was The Rush Limbaugh Show. WJAS did not choose to carry WPGB's signature morning drive program \\"Quinn and Rose\\", which returned to the Pittsburgh radio market on WBGG in 2018. WJAS now runs a morning drive show hosted by David Blomquist (\\"Bloomdaddy\\"), which is produced at WWVA in Wheeling, West Virginia.WJAS lineup - WJAS Radio Pittsburgh Panthers Women's Basketball and Duquesne Dukes 1320 WJAS is the home to University of Pittsburgh Panthers women's basketball games and the Suzie McConnell Serio radio show, as well as Duquesne Dukes football and men's basketball games.

Although he was not the full-time closer, Villone compiled eight saves in the 1994 season. Because of his stellar 1994 campaign, Seattle promoted him, effective at the start of the season, to their AAA affiliate, Tacoma (still their affiliate today). He had a magnificent start to the 1995 season, going 1‚Äì0 with a 0.61 earned run average. In 22 appearances as the full-time closer, Villone saved 13 games and struck out 43 batters. Villone was recalled from AAA on April 28, 1995. He made his Major League debut on April 28, 1995 working a scoreless ninth inning against the Detroit Tigers. During that inning he stuck out Travis Fryman of the Tigers for his first career strikeouts.https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/SEA/SEA199504280.shtml He posted an 0‚Äì2 record with a 7.91 earned run average in 19 games for the Mariners. He walked 23 batters, but struck out 26. He was a victim of the long ball, allowing six home runs. =San Diego Padres= On July 31, 1995, the Mariners General Manager at the time, Woody Woodward, dealt Villone and Marc Newfield to San Diego in exchange for Greg Keagle and Andy Benes. Villone spent the remainder of the season with the Padres, going 2‚Äì1 with a 4.21 earned run average. In 25 innings, Villone gave up 24 hits, 11 walks while striking out 37. He started the season with San Diego‚Äôs AAA Affiliate, Las Vegas. Villone proved that he could be dominant, so, San Diego called him up. He was just as good with the Padres, going 1‚Äì1 in 21 games with a 2.95 earned run average. He pitched 18 innings, recording 17 hits, 7 walks, and 19 strikeouts. =Milwaukee Brewers= On July 31, 1996, the Padres shipped Villone, Bryce Florie, and Marc Newfield to the Milwaukee Brewers for Gerald Parent and Greg Vaughn. Despite the trade, Villone still had success in Milwaukee, pitching 24 innings (23 games), allowing 14 hits, 18 walks, and 9 earned runs (3.28 earned run average). Ron Villone stayed in the majors for the entire campaign. He pitched another season for the Brewers, going 1‚Äì0 with a 3.42 earned run average. His workload increased, as he pitched in 50 games (52 innings), giving up 54 hits, and 36 walks. For the second straight year, Villone averaged less than one strikeout per inning pitched. (In 1997, he fanned 40 in 52 innings) =Cleveland Indians= On December 8, 1997, he was forced to pack his bags, once again, as Milwaukee traded him, Ben McDonald, and Mike Fetters to Cleveland. As part of the deal, Jeff Juden and Marquis Grissom went to Milwaukee. This was the third consecutive year that Villone was traded, but this was the first year in which he was not dealt midway through the year. It was a rough year in for Ron, especially considering the fact that he split time with Buffalo (Cleveland‚Äôs AAA affiliate) and the major-league club. He had a better time in Buffalo, going 2‚Äì2 with a 2.01 earned run average in 23 appearances. In 22 innings, he gave up 20 hits and walked 11. Apparently, he had more velocity, because he struck out 28 batters. Unfortunately, he could not maintain control in Cleveland, as he walked 22 in 27 innings (25 outings). He also gave up 30 hits, and had an earned run average of 6.00. On April 2, , he was released by the Indians. =Cincinnati Reds= Three days later, the Cincinnati Reds signed him, and he was back in business as a starting pitcher/long reliever. During the 1999 season, he won nine games, lost seven, and had an earned run average of 4.23. He pitched in 29 games (22 starts) pitching 142 innings. One hundred fourteen batters reached base via the hit, while 73 reached courtesy of the base on balls. Even though the strikeouts per nine innings went down (4.91), he proved to be effective. In , he was not as effective, yet he posted a .500 record (10‚Äì10). He walked more batters (78), struck out less (77), allowed more hits (154), and had a higher earned run average (5.43) than the 1999 season. =Colorado Rockies= On November 8, 2000 he was dealt to the Colorado Rockies for Jeff Taglienti and Justin Carter. As a spot starter and long reliever, he went 1‚Äì3 with a 6.36 earned run average. In 22 games (6 starts), he pitched 46 innings, allowing 56 hits and 29 walks, and striking out 48. =Houston Astros= June 27, marked the fifth time that Villone was traded. On this occasion, he was dealt to the Houston Astros for Jay Powell. He continued to struggle, agoing 5‚Äì7 with a 5.56 earned run average. He continued to be a spot starter/long reliever on the Astros‚Äô pitching staff. In 68 innings, he gave up 77 hits, but lowered his walk total to 24. and struck out 65 batters. Villone was granted free agency on November 5, 2001. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On February 16, , the Pittsburgh Pirates signed him to a one-year contract. With the Pirates, he went 4‚Äì6 with a 5.81 earned run average. Over 45 games (seven starts), he pitched 93 innings, allowed 95 hits, 34 walks, and had 55 strikeouts. Villone was granted free agency on October 29, 2002. =Arizona Diamondbacks= Five months later, he signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. They assigned him to Tucson, their AAA affiliate. While at Tucson, Ron posted a 1‚Äì1 record with a 3.55 earned run average. However, they assigned him to pitch exclusively out of the bullpen. In 25 innings, he allowed 20 hits and 12 walks while recording 22 strikeouts. Despite this limited success, he was released on May 15, . =Houston Astros (2nd time)= On May 19, 2003, he returned to the Astros on a one-year deal. He was assigned to AAA New Orleans. A 3‚Äì1 record and a 1.23 earned run average in 5 starts (29 innings) earned him a trip to the big leagues, where he went 6‚Äì6 with a 4.13 earned run average. All 19 outings with the Astros were starts, amassing 106 innings. He allowed a total of 91 hits and 48 walks, and had 91 strikeouts. =Seattle Mariners (2nd time)= On November 2, 2003, Villone chose to test the free agent market, once again. The Mariners signed him to a one-year contract. Villone had a decent season with them, going 8‚Äì6 with a 4.08 earned run average. Again, Villone was used in a long relief/spot starter role, something that he was accustomed to from his days with Houston, Colorado, and Pittsburgh. In 117 innings, Villone gave up 102 hits and 64 walks, while striking out 86. His contract expired at the end of the season, and he declared free agency once again. The Mariners inked him to another one-year deal on December 19, 2004. In the season, Ron went 2‚Äì3 with a 2.45 earned run average.

As a Marlin, Villone pitched in 27 games (23 innings), mostly as a lefty specialist. He gave up 24 hits, 12 walks, and 29 strikeouts. Villone struggled in Florida, posting a 6.85 earned run average with the Marlins. =New York Yankees= Scranton-Wilkes Barre Yankees, the Triple-A affiliate of the New York Yankees. On February 13, he was signed to a minor league deal with the New York Yankees. During spring training in 2007, Ron was given a chance to earn a spot in the Yankee bullpen, but was beat out for the last spot by Sean Henn. However, he was called back up in mid-May. =St. Louis Cardinals= In February , Villone was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals to a minor league contract and was invited to spring training.Cardinals invite Villone to camp Coming out of camp, Villone made the Opening Day roster. =New York Mets= On February 27, 2009, Villone signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets and was invited to spring training.Mets sign Villone to Minors deal He did not make the team, and was granted his release on March 27. =Washington Nationals= He then signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals on April 10 and was assigned to Triple-A Syracuse.Nationals sign left-hander Villone On May 7, Villone's contract was purchased from Syracuse.

For example, during a July 23, 2010 game with the Durham Bulls, Villone took the mound in the eighth inning with a one-run lead but gave up a walk to what would become the tying run. He then threw to first base 12 times to hold the runner, without once throwing to home plate, annoying the crowd who booed Villone mercilessly. When Villone finally threw to home plate, the batter bunted the ball back to Villone, failed to make the play.http://www.watchingdurhambullsbaseball.com/2010/07/how-hot-was- it.html#links Villone walked the next batter and hit the following batter with a two-strike pitch to force in the tying run.http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/8870030/article-Durham-rallies- past-Syracuse-in-the-8th?instance=homesixthleft He was immediately pulled from the game.

It is mainly located in Africa and in the Afro-descendant communities in the world, particularly in Benin and Nigeria. History The movement was founded by Samuel Bilewu Joseph Oshoffa, a former carpenter born in Dahomey (now Benin) in 1909. Raised as Protestant (Methodism), he had a divine revelation on 27 May 1947, during a solar eclipse, in a forest where he was lost. He felt called to pray, to heal the sick, and to raise the dead, and he founded his church in September 1947. Having appointed himself through the guidance the Prophet, Reverend, Pastor, and Founder, he occupied the highest office of the movement he had just founded. The hegemony he exercised on doctrine and discipline issues made succession difficult after his death in 1985 in Lagos, Nigeria. The Celestial Church of Christ (CCC) was recognized and authorized by the Republic of Dahomey (former name of Benin) in 1965. From 1976, the church launched an evangelistic campaign in the former colony of the French West Africa, which became independent in 1960. From the late 1990s, this church has shown its willingness to use the Internet as a privileged means of evangelization thus allowing the many existing branches of the church within the African Diaspora (United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, France, USA) to maintain contact with each other and with Nigeria, the country in which the church is the most popular. The movement has continued to grow since Oshoffa's death, but has also suffered setbacks‚Äîthe most immediate being severe difficulties related to the matter of succession. Oshoffa was succeeded by Alexander Abiodun Adebayo Bada, who was head of the church until his death on 8 September 2000. Bada was briefly followed as leader by Philip Hunsu Ajose, who died in March 2001. There was a dispute over the succession to Ajose, with some declaring Gilbert Oluwatosin Jesse the leader, while the majority recognised the Reverend Emmanuel Oshoffa, son of Samuel Oshoffa. Following Jesse's death, his faction declared that Superior Evangelist Paul Suru Maforikan was the new spiritual leader of the church. Contrary to the procedure of succession in Nigeria, Porto-Novo, the supreme headquarters, successfully chose Benoit Agbaossi (1931‚Äì2010) to the head of the church, who in his turn appointed Benoit Adeogun as the next Rev. Pastor shortly before his death in 2010. Imeko Convocation Every December (usually, between 5-7 days preceding Christmas), the church hosts an international event called Imeko Convocation, held in spirit and belief of pilgrimage. It is mandated that every member of Celestial Church of Christ all over the word attends annually. The church believes the event attendance is a mandate, given through the founder of the church, Samuel Bilewu Joseph Oshoffa, after declarations that God had chosen Imeko as the New Jerusalem for the fold. Beliefs The Celestial Church of Christ is prophetic with Christian background. The faithful are called ‚ÄúCelestians‚Äù, and the church is sometimes informally called ‚ÄúCele‚Äù. The official name of the church is inspired by a vision by which Jesus would have said that Church members adore him as do the angels in heaven. The name of the church comes from Deuteronomy 26:15 \\"Look down from thy Holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel and the land which thou hast given us, as thou didst swear to our father, a land flowing with milk and honey\\". The name signifies that they deem themselves as celestial or a representative of the heavenly on Earth. The church claims inspiration from God through the manifestation of the Holy Spirit among the faithful. Its doctrinal teachings are based on the Bible, and any superstition or animist belief from traditional African religions is excluded, as in other churches in the Aladura movement. The church is governed by twelve major recommendations, consisting several banned things, including food, common to other monotheistic religions. Tobacco, alcohol and eating pork are forbidden. The faithful must remove their shoes for prayer and in the places of worship. Men and women are separated at the church. Menstruating women and those who have recently given birth are unclean and cannot attend church events for seven days in the first case after which they would be \\"sanctified\\". Members of Celestial Church of Christ are forbidden to engage or participate in any form of idolatory, fetish ceremony or cults, black magic and charms. Only men who are \\"anointed\\" are allowed access to the altar. The church uses all English bibles and the Yoruba translated versions. Although the church takes elements from Gungbe and Yoruba thought, it also has strong similarities to the \\"purification movements\\" against paganism that are relatively common in African Christianity. Oshoffa believed he had a mission to combat \\"'Satan', 'fetish priests' and other 'powers of darkness'.\\"(Marburg colloquy)  Architecture  The temples of worship always face east. An altar stand has seven candle holders that represent the seven spirits of Jehovah as represented in Rev. 4:5. The church auditorium also has different rows for male and female seats. But on days that services are observed during the week like the Wednesday and the Friday services another alter is made which has 3 candles rather than 7. Reception In 2001, it was the second largest church in Benin by the number of its practitioners (nearly half a million).

Owned by Pentecostal Temple Development Corporation, the station operates at 1360 kHz with a power of 5,000 watts daytime, 1,000 watts nighttime, and is licensed to McKeesport, Pennsylvania. HistoryAs WMCK= The station began broadcasting on April 30, 1947, with the call letters WMCK, and under the ownership of the Mon-Yough Broadcasting Company. George Raikes was company president and Jack Craddock was general manager. Studios were located at 517 Market Street in McKeesport. Its initial programming included Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games. During the early years, the station broadcast at a full-time power of 1,000 watts, day and night, changing to a directional antenna pattern during the nighttime hours. =As WIXZ= Following its acquisition by WWZ Corporation, it was a Top 40 station with the call letters WIXZ (\\"Wick-zee 1360\\") beginning in 1969. Its studios and offices were moved to the recently completed Monroeville Mall. Among its disc jockeys during the Top 40 era was Jeff Christie, better known today by his real name, Rush Limbaugh. On June 19, 1974, the station was sold to Renda Broadcasting Corporation. Anthony F. Renda was the company president and Melvin Abramovitz was appointed as station manager. By the end of the decade, the station changed its format to country and the studios and offices were moved to 400 Lincoln Highway in East McKeesport. On July 16, 1985, Renda Broadcasting Corporation sold WIXZ to Serena Communications, a company owned by Renda executive Alan C. Serena. Renda had acquired the Pittsburgh stations WJAS and WSHH the year before and was required to sell off WIXZ to comply with more stringent FCC ownership requirements which, at the time, limited owners to possess no more than one AM and one FM property in any given market. Serena maintained the format until September 1997, when Renda Broadcasting bought back the station after FCC ownership rules were relaxed. =As WPTT and WMNY= Shortly after the re-acquisition, WIXZ switched to a talk format, then took the WPTT call letters (formerly on channel 22 in Pittsburgh). On August 19, 2008, Renda Broadcasting announced that WPTT would be switching formats from talk to financial advice;Mark Roth, \\"Format change will take Cullen off WPTT\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, August 19, 2008. this was accompanied by a call change to WMNY. In all of its incarnations since WMCK, the radio station has positioned itself as a Pittsburgh outlet, rather than directly addressing the suburb of McKeesport, despite a weak nighttime signal. On September 19, 2011, Renda Broadcasting announced that WMNY would return to its \\"AM News Talk 1360\\" format. This format contains numerous popular talk programs from the Talk Radio Network based radio network. =As WGBN= In July 2013, Renda Broadcasting announced that WMNY would be donated to Pentecostal Temple Development Corporation, licensee of WGBN in New Kensington. The transaction was completed on October 9, 2013. 1360 went off the air for about a month to allow engineering adjustments that would allow it to simulcast 1150's programming. The stations swapped call signs on March 1, 2014.

In the 2016 Census (212,000 estimated 2018), 24,580 people indicated Laotian ancestry. Bilateral relations between Canada and Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), or Laos, were established in 1954 with the formalization of the independence of the Kingdom of Laos from France. In August 2015, Canada's first resident diplomat opened the Office of the Embassy of Canada in Vientiane, Lao PDR. The term Laotian is wide, as it either refers to the people born in Laos and its many ethnicities [49 recognized by Laos] (the Hmong people per example) or, the real term for the majority Lao Loum (constituting 69% of the country) that is simply Lao. The ‚ÄúS‚Äù in Laos is actually silent, it was added as the plural of Lao during the French unification of the many Lao states in 1947 to form the Kingdom of Laos (unified from the Kingdom of Luang Phrabang, the Kingdom of Vientiane, the Kingdom of Champassak and the principality of Muan Phuang. All were previously ruled by Siam, and before that were part of the first Lao Kingdom of Lan Xang.) Today, many Lao Canadians (like Lao Americans and Laotians in France) claim royal ancestry of the main dynasty of Khun Lo such as the House of Champassak in these former states. Lao people have similar food, culture and language to the Thai of Thailand. Across Canada, restaurants serving Thai food are usually owned by Lao people or the ethnic Isan people. (See the famous Green papaya salad) Most Lao still refer to themselves as Tai (not to be confused with Thai from Thailand), but from the large sub-group of the Tai people. The Lao identity first appeared during the major lost of the Khorat plateau in 1778 when the Rattanakosin Kingdom (Siam) took over Vientiane and the Lao rebellion (1826‚Äì1828) against Siamese rule. After the failed independence attempt, Rama III implemented forced tattooing to identify the ethnic lao population and accelerated huge population transfer into what is today Thailand. It would be officially proclaimed during French colonial rule when all states where unified in 1904, thus distinguishing them from Thais of Thailand. Language Most Lao speak French because they were once under the French protectorate of Laos. But many also speak English as well as Spanish (often recent immigrants from Posadas in Misiones, Argentina. See Asian Argentines) The French spoken in Laos (Also called the Lao cr√©ole) is based on standard Parisian French but has some minor differences in vocabulary as in other French dialects of Asia. Today, the French spoken in Laos is slightly different from french learned during the colonial period, giving them a little hard time translating in the homeland. Many Lao can also speak and understand Thai, Northern Thai language, Phuan language and Isan. Other dialects related to the Kra-dai languages are also understood, such as Tai Dam language in Viet Nam, Shan in Myanmar, Ahom in Assam, India, Meitei in Manipur, India, and Chittagong, Bangladesh as well as Dai of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in China. There are also notable communities of Laotian Chinese that speaks the teochew dialect and Lao with Thai-Persian heritage clustered around canadians cities.(See the Iranians in Thailand) These groups cames as a result of the Laotian civil war fleeing the communist takeover. Migration to Canada The Laotian Civil War, also infamously known as the Secret War by the CIA, sparked the emigration of thousands of Lao. It was a brutal war between the Communist Pathet Lao and the Royal Lao Army. From 1964 to 1973, the U.S. dropped more than two million tons of ordnance on Laos during 580,000 bombing missions‚Äîequal to a planeload of bombs every eight minutes, 24-hours a day, for nine years ‚Äì making Laos the most heavily bombed country per capita in history. Mass migration from Laos to Cambodia peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s, consisting of both government-sponsored and privately sponsored refugees from camps in Thailand, where they had fled to due to the Laotian Civil War and the final victory of the Pathet Lao. Between 1970s and early 1980s many Canadian families, especially in Quebec, sponsored many Lao. But by the 1990s, most refugees in the camps were instead repatriated to Laos. Canada took in 12,793 Laotian refugees. The Lao community is well assimilated to Canadian culture especially in the province of Quebec. This resulted in many mixed couples having children of mixed heritage. Demography Most migrants consisted of young families; there were few elderly among them. A significant proportion were drawn from among the community of ethnic Chinese in Laos. Most of the communities are settled in and more often outside of big Canadians cities such as Burnaby and Surrey in British Columbia, Kitchener, Ontario, where 995 Laotian Canadians live (0.004% of its population),Kitchener, City [Census subdivision, Ontario and Ontario [Province , Statistics Canada Markham and Calgary. In Quebec, most live in the North Shore (Montreal). ReligionBuddhism= Laotian migrants in Canada mostly follow Theravada Buddhism with a mixture of animism also known as Tai folk religion, though Mahayana Buddhists are also found among those of Laotian Chinese ethnicity. In 1990, British Columbia had no Laotian Buddhist temple; the nearest was a Laotian American temple in Seattle. Within Canada, Laotian Buddhist temples have been opened in Sainte-Julienne, Montreal, Quebec, Toronto, Ontario, and Winnipeg, Manitoba. =Christianity= There are perhaps 500 Christians, most of whom converted while living in refugee camps. Christianity is spreading within the community. Recent immigrants from Posadas, Argentina of Lao descent mostly follows Roman catholicism. =Islam= There is a growing community of Lao muslims living in Canada. They are mostly Sunni and Ibadi. Many of whom were born in Laos and are of Indonesian, Thai, Katang (see the Katang people) and Malaysian descent.

The population as of 2017 is estimated to be 200,000. The Laotian community in France forms the most established overseas Laotian population outside of Southeast Asia, with a presence in the country dating to before the end of the Laotian Civil War and mass refugee migration that resulted from it.Carine Hahn, Le Laos, Karthala, 1999, page 77 History The presence of Laotian people in France began during the early 20th century, when Laos was a protectorate of France. With the steady introduction of the French education system by the colonists, a number of Laotian students were able to study in France, including members of the Lao Royal Family. A smaller number of Laotian workers also settled in France during this period. Following Laotian independence in 1953 and the Geneva Accords, a significant number of Lao continued to immigrate to France. This wave of migrants initially consisted of those loyal to the colonial government, followed by students and middle class entrepreneurs who arrived throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Community organizations were established by this group of migrants to better serve Laotian immigrant and expatriate needs, and would form the base of Laotian cultural institutions for later immigrants. However, the largest influx of Laotians immigrated to France following the Vietnam War and communist takeover of their homeland. France was an ideal destination for Laotian refugees who were educated or formed part of the elite and middle class in the home nation, while poorer refugees tended to emigrate to North America and Australia through the assistance of the American, Canadian and Australian governments.Knowledge of Immigrant Nationalities of Santa Clara County (KIN) - Laos Culture and demographics Unlike their counterpart communities in the United States, Canada, and Australia, Laotians in France are more successful and better integrated into the host country due to stronger knowledge of the nation's social aspects, such as culture, language, and history. Although the issue of immigrant groups and their level of assimilation has been an important issue in French politics, the Laotian community is highly integrated into French society, with high average rates of educational and economic achievement, especially among the generations of French-born Lao.La jeunesse lao de France, quelle identit√©? (in French) The majority of Laotians in France live in Paris and the surrounding √éle-de-France region, where many Lao-based businesses and community organizations are located in the Quartier Asiatique neighborhood of the 13th arrondissement of Paris. Smaller communities reside in Marseille, Lille, and Strasbourg. While the generation of immigrants to France tries to preserve Laotian culture and uses the Lao language among the community, the generations born in France are increasingly influenced by French culture, with many members of the generations being unable to understand or speak Lao. Cultural organizations are present to serve both immigrant and French-born Lao, including weekend Lao-language schools for the latter group. Laotian Buddhist temples serve as community and cultural centers for the Laotian population in France, and important traditional holidays such as Lao New Year and the Pha That Luang Festival are observed in addition to French holidays.Nouvel an Lao (in French) Political views While the rate of naturalization among Laotian immigrants is high, the community is not actively involved in French politics. Instead, many in the generation of refugees tend to closely monitor politics in Laos. Additionally, the community is largely anti-communist and opposes the one- party rule of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party in the home country since the end of the Laotian Civil War. Earlier Lao immigrants and expatriates to France historically played important roles in shaping the politics of Laos during the early and mid-20th century.

SettingAnchorage= The story continues sixteen years after the events of Predator's Gold. The peaceful city of Anchorage is now a static settlement called \\"Anchorage-in-Vineland\\" on an island in the Dead Continent. During those peaceful years, Tom and Hester have raised a teenage daughter named Wren Natsworthy. =Brighton= Brighton is a raft resort city, which is currently sailing in the Atlantic. It is running its own slave trade, influenced by its mayor, Nimrod Pennyroyal. =Green Storm= Under the Stalker Fang, formerly the famous Anti-Tractionist heroine Anna Fang, the Green Storm has been waging war against the Traction Cities for fourteen years. At first, the Storm seemed to be winning the war against the moving cities. However, the cities began to fight back, and alliances were formed between several cities, including the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft, an alliance of German speaking cities. The Green Storm has legions of soldiers and Stalkers, fighter airships called \\"Murasaki Fox Spirits\\" and \\"Zhang Chen Hawkmoths\\", which are vast air destroyers and carriers. Apparently, the Stalker Fang regards her military forces expendable, which makes her unpopular among many other leaders of the Storm. This is evident by the use of \\"Tumblers\\" - one-manned craft used to ram Traction Cities in kamikaze missions. The Green Storm also has an elite branch of its military called the \\"Resurrection Corps\\", who are responsible for resurrecting dead bodies into Stalkers for the war effort. Title Explanation The title is probably a reference to the words of the Stalker Fang in Predator's Gold: \\"...and then we shall release a storm which will rid this world of [the Tractionists'] infernal devices happily ever after forever.\\" Plot Sixteen years after the events of Predator's Gold, the former ice city of Anchorage has settled on an island in North America unaffected by the fallout from the Sixty Minute War and has become a static city named Anchorage-in-Vineland. Most of the inhabitants are happy with their new life, but Wren Natsworthy, the teenage daughter of Tom Natsworthy and Hester Shaw, is bored with her life and seeks adventure. When she sneaks out one night Wren encounters three Lost Boys, Remora, Fishcake and their older leader Gargle; who have come to Anchorage in search of a mysterious Rasmussen family artifact named the Tin Book. The Book, bearing the insignia of the President of the United States of America, contains the activation codes for the final remaining orbital weapons left over from the Sixty Minute War; potentially with firepower far greater than that of MEDUSA, which destroyed the Traction City of London in Mortal Engines. After meeting former Lost Boy now Anchorage resident Caul, who refuses to help him, Gargle persuades Wren to retrieve the Tin Book for him and to join them on their journeys around the world. Wren begins her mission by asking the now- adult margravine Freya Rasmussen, knowing that the Book is in the palace's library. Freya tells Wren of the Book's origins but explains that no one knows its purpose or meaning. When Wren reports to Gargle he tells her that Nimrod Pennyroyal's book about the time he spent in Anchorage has revealed the Lost Boys' existence to the raft cities that they previously robbed. As a result, the Lost Boys have been forced to loot cities further afield, but most of the Lost Boys' limpets never return. Gargle explains that raft cities have also begun searching for Grimsby and claims the Tin Book contains information that could get the sunken city moving again; but in actuality he intends to sell it to Stalker Fang for protection. Unaware of Gargle's true intentions, Wren steals the Book and gives it to him, whilst Caul alerts to Tom and Hester that Wren is missing. Hester finds the limpet and, believing that Wren is in danger, shoots and kills Gargle and Remora. Fishcake, devastated by the death of his comrades, kidnaps Wren with the intention of taking her to Grimsby. En route to the sunken city, Fishcake receives a communication from the raft resort of Brighton, claiming that the parents of kidnapped Lost Boys have united to track down their missing children. Fishcake, believing that he will be reunited with his parents and persuaded by Wren who believes her best chance of escape is there, changes course to Brighton. Arriving at the raft- city pleasure resort, the pair's limpet is captured and the two are taken in as slaves, the communication being a ruse to stop the Lost Boys. The owner of the slave trade company, Nabisco Shkin, intends to sell the two to Traction Cities in Nuevo Maya, but Wren convinces him to give them to Pennyroyal, who is now Mayor of Brighton; due to Wren's knowledge of Anchorage (and thus can expose Pennyroyal's lies). Shkin interrogates Fishcake, who reveals the location of Grimsby, prompting Brighton to change course and destroy it with depth charges. Shkin takes Wren up to Pennyroyal's floating palace above Brighton, Cloud 9. The slave-owner attempts to extort a hefty sum from Pennyroyal for Wren and to have the truth silenced, but Wren suddenly claims that she is a Lost Girl and has never been to Anchorage. She gives Pennyroyal the Tin Book and is employed in his household, to serve as a handmaiden for his overbearing wife Boo-Boo. Shkin, angered by Wren's lie, employs Fishcake to lead him to Anchorage and to enslave everyone there. Tom and Hester take an old limpet with Caul and Freya to Grimsby to save Wren. When they arrive, they find the wreckage of the sunk city and the bodies of many Lost Boys. The four meet Uncle in his chamber, who informs them that Gargle's limpet hasn't returned and that Wren is likely in Brighton. Uncle seemingly wins Caul back to the Lost Boys, who locks Tom, Hester and Freya up; but Caul later frees them when Uncle is asleep. Uncle eventually discovers them, but is killed when he shoots the balloon holding his monitoring screens and they collapse on him. Tom and Hester take Caul's old limpet to find Wren, whilst Caul and Freya take the remaining Lost Boys back to Anchorage where the pair marry. Meanwhile, the Stalker Shrike, who was seemingly killed by Tom in Mortal Engines is 're- resurrected' to mark the Stalker Fang's birthday by Dr. Oenone Zero; albeit with his previous memories wiped. Zero is promoted to Fang's Surgeon-Mechanic, though she intends to assassinate the Stalker as revenge for her aviator brother Eno being resurrected into a Stalker. Fang has the Green Storm armies extend their borders via bombing and destroying Traction Cities, starting a war with the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft. Zero is followed by Shrike to a Christian chapel, where she confides aloud that she will kill the Stalker Fang with a mysterious weapon. He prepares to kill her, but cannot bring himself to, nor alert the authorities of her treachery. Shrike realises that Zero has implemented a barrier that disables him from betraying her; but he intends to stop her from assassinating Fang. Wren makes friends with fellow slave Cynthia Twite and another young African slave, Theo Ngoni, who used to be a Green Storm kamikaze aviator that was captured. Wren plots to escape on Pennyroyal's private sky-yacht the Peewit by enlisting Theo's help, but he refuses. Shkin meets with Pennyroyal's advisor on Old-Tech, Walter Plovery, who explains what the Tin Book contains and orders him to retrieve it for him. The Moon Festival, a time when no city hunts nor eats each other, arrives as Brighton meets a few other cities on the shores of Africa. Plovery is invited to a dinner-party held by Pennyroyal and breaks into the Mayor's office, but is killed by an intruder. Wren and Theo are nearly arrested by Pennyroyal, as she tricked Cloud 9 aviators to refuel the Peewit, but Boo-Boo saves them, falsely believing that Wren and Theo are in love. Tom and Hester arrive in Brighton, and split up to search for Wren. Hester discovers Pennyroyal's corrupted version of the events of Predator's Gold, including that she sold Anchorage to Arkangel and the renamed exhibited Jenny Haniver. Tom meets with Shkin to negotiate Wren's release but is captured. Shkin plans to use Tom and Wren to expose Pennyroyal as a fraud and retrieve the Tin Book to sell off to the highest bidder. Told by Tom via a note that he was going to the Pepperpot, Shkin's base of operations, Hester plans to release the slaves inside to create a panic. At the Moon Festival, Shkin confronts Wren and asks her to fetch the Tin Book for him. Wren manages to get Theo's help and discovers a Green Storm Stalker-bird inside the safe. Destroying it and taking the Tin Book, the pair discover that Cloud 9 has been set adrift and that a Green Storm airship is heading toward Brighton. Hester breaks into the Pepperpot and releases the Lost Boy slaves. Fishcake visits Tom in his cell and tells him that Wren is on Cloud 9, and Tom promises to take Fishcake away to live in Anchorage. Tom and Fishcake meet Hester, who kills Shkin's men in the pandemonium. Zero discovers the Stalker Fang has commanded General Naga, the Green Storm's second-in-command, to destroy Brighton. On board the Requiem Vortex, Fang's personal ship, Shrike finds out that Fang covets the Tin Book, after reading about Anchorage when she wanted to know more about Tom, whom she met at Rogue's Roost in Predator's Gold. Wren discovers that Cynthia is a Green Storm agent, that she killed Plovery, installed the Stalker-bird in the safe and set Cloud 9 adrift; she explains that the Tin Book will help the Green Storm win the war against the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft. Cynthia takes the Tin Book and holds them at gunpoint, but the two are saved by Pennyroyal who knocks Cynthia out. Making their way to the Peewit, they discover Shkin attempting to escape Brighton inside it. Shkin shoots Pennyroyal, seemingly takes the Tin Book and makes off on the Peewit, but the airship is destroyed by Stalker-birds. Wren and Theo had tricked Shkin into taking a decoy, but are captured by Naga and brought before Fang. Fang takes the Book and memorizes the codes. Zero interrogates the pair, who explain to her what the Book contains. Knowing that Fang will kill thousands with it, Zero commands Shrike to kill Fang; he realises that he is the weapon she spoke of. Shrike manages to seemingly destroy Fang, scattering her battered pieces across the coastline of Africa. Suddenly remembering Hester, Shrike escapes from Naga. As Cloud 9 begins to burn and descend, the Tin Book's pages begin to blacken. Tom and Hester recover the Jenny Haniver, but Hester leaves Fishcake behind as revenge for taking Wren, despite Tom's pleas to go back for him. Wren and Theo discover Pennyroyal survived his wounds and take him with them as they try to escape. Zero also attempts to escape but is blocked by Naga. Secretly disgusted by Fang's actions in the war and wasting men, Naga commends Zero for orchestrating the Stalker's demise and takes control of the Green Storm. Naga takes Zero and the passengers from Cloud 9 on board the Requiem Vortex and leave. Pennyroyal tells Wren that Hester sold Anchorage to Arkangel, one of the few elements of his book that was true, but she doesn't believe him. Tom and Hester find the three, and Hester attempts to kill Pennyroyal to make sure that her crime to Anchorage isn't discovered, but Wren tells Tom about what she did to stop her. Hester flees into the burning wreckage of Cloud 9 in despair, where Shrike finds her. Tom, Wren, Theo and Pennyroyal escape in the Jenny Haniver as Cloud 9 finally collapses onto the African shore. As scavenger towns arrive, Shrike takes Hester's unconscious body into the nearby Sahara Desert. Fishcake, escaping from the Lost Boys, swims to the African coast. Wandering alone on the dunes, he encounters the remains of the Stalker Fang, who asks him to rebuild her, which he agrees to.

They are the companion to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The admissibility and use of evidence in criminal proceedings (as well as civil) is governed by the separate Federal Rules of Evidence. Drafting and enactment The rules are promulgated by the Supreme Court of the United States, pursuant to its statutory authority under the Rules Enabling Act.The Rules Enabling Act was codified at 28 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 2072, 2074. The Supreme Court must transmit a copy of its rules to the United States Congress no later than May 1 of the year in which they are to go into effect, and the new rule can then become effective no earlier than December 1 of that year. Congress retains the power to reject the Court's proposed rules or amendments, to modify them, or to enact rules or amendments itself. Congress has rarely rejected the Court's proposed amendments, though it has frequently passed its own. The rules are initially drafted by an Advisory Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States, which consists of appointed judges, U.S. Department of Justice representatives, practicing lawyers, and legal scholars. After public comment, the draft rules are submitted to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, which in turn submits them to the Judicial Conference, which finally recommends them to the Supreme Court for approval. The explanatory notes of the drafting Advisory Committee are published with the final adopted rules, and are frequently used as an authority on their interpretation. History For the first 150 years of the federal judiciary, there was no uniform federal criminal procedure. The Judiciary Act of 1789 directed federal courts to apply the law of the state in which the court sat regarding jury selection and the process for arrests, bail, and preliminary hearings. The Act did not address procedure in other areas, and though subsequent legislation filled in some gaps, Congress never enacted a generally applicable statutory command to observe state criminal procedure, as it had regarding civil procedure under the Conformity Act. Congress also enacted some specific federal rules, beginning in 1790 with provisions included in the first U.S. federal criminal statutes.Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, ¬ß 29, 1 Stat. 118 (requiring those accused of treason to receive copy of indictment and list of witnesses and jurors three days before trial; a two-day notice requirement for all other capital cases); id. ¬ß 30, 1 Stat. 119 (the silence of the accused is not to be treated as a guilty plea); id. ¬ß 31, 1 Stat. 119 (establishing statute of limitations for prosecution). The result was an incomplete patchwork of state and federal law that the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts did little to fill in, despite seeming authorization under the Judiciary Act to do so.The Judiciary Act of 1789 stated that federal courts had the power to establish \\"all necessary rules for the orderly conducting [of] business.\\" Early Supreme Court cases also fully endorsed congressional authority to enact rules of procedure,Wayman v. Southard, 23 U.S. 1 (1825), based this congressional power in the Necessary and Proper Clause. Livingston v. Story, 34 U.S. 632 (1835) based it in the congressional power to \\"ordain and establish\\" the lower federal courts under Article III. and declined the opportunity to directly claim such authority for the courts under Article III of the United States Constitution. A few federal court decisions nonetheless established what amounted to particular federal common law rules of criminal procedure, which added to the lack of conformity in the federal system. In 1933, Congress authorized the Supreme Court to prescribe rules of criminal appellate procedure, which included any proceeding after the entry of a verdict or plea.Act of Feb. 24, 1933, Pub. L. No. 371, 47 Stat. 904, later codified at 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 3772. Satisfaction with the first Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, enacted in 1938, led to support for uniform criminal rules, and authority to establish rules of general criminal procedure was given to the Supreme Court in 1940, with the Sumners Courts Act.The Sumners Courts Act of June 29, 1940, 76 P.L. 675; 76 Cong. Ch. 445; 54 Stat. 688, later codified at . The act was named after Congressman Hatton W. Sumners (D-TX), the chair of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary from 1931 until 1947. The first Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were subsequently adopted by order of the Court on December 26, 1944, for procedures up to verdict, and on February 8, 1946, for procedures after verdict, thus completing the project. Justices Black and Frankfurter dissented. The full set, denominated the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, then took effect on March 21, 1946.327 U.S. 821; Cong. Rec., vol. 91, pt. 1, p. 17, Exec. Comm. 4; H. Doc. 12, 79th Cong. Under the Sumners Courts Act, the U.S. Attorney General was given the responsibility of transmitting amendments of the rules to Congress, though this was amended in 1949 to give that duty to the Chief Justice. The turn-around period for the rules becoming effective was originally one full congressional session. This was amended in 1950 to impose the May 1 deadline, but with a 90-day delay in effectiveness. In 1988, authorization for the Rules was incorporated under the Rules Enabling Act, and codified at 28 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 2072, 2074. See also * Rule 41 NotesReferences *Beale, Sara Sun.

The screenplay is based on a 1908 short story by William J. Locke. The film stars Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Natascha McElhone, and Miriam Margolyes. Plot Ladies in Lavender is set in picturesque coastal Cornwall, in a tight-knit fishing village in 1936. A gifted young Polish violinist from Krak√≥w, Andrea is sailing to America when he is swept overboard from his ship in a storm. When the Widdington sisters, Janet and Ursula, discover the handsome stranger washed up on the beach below their house, they nurse him back to health. However, the presence of the musically talented young man disrupts the peaceful lives of the sisters and the community in which they live. Holidaying artist Olga Danilof, the sister of famed violinist Boris Danilof, becomes interested in Andrea after hearing him play the violin. Olga writes a letter to the sisters, telling them who she is and that she would like to introduce her brother to Andrea. Instead of giving him the letter, understanding her sister has feelings for Andrea, Janet burns it. As time progresses, Olga and Andrea grow closer, and one day Andrea angrily confronts the sisters about the letter. Andrea, realizing that Ursula has feelings for him, apologizes for getting angry and they reconcile. Olga tells her brother of Andrea's talent, and he asks to meet Andrea in London. When Andrea meets with Olga to discuss the letter from her brother, she tells him that they must leave on a train immediately because her brother is only in London for 24 hours. Although Andrea cares deeply for the sisters, he knows this is his chance to start a career, and he leaves with Olga without saying goodbye. The sisters, worried that something has happened to him, call a friend of Andrea's who tells them he saw Andrea and Olga getting on a train. Thinking she'll never see him again, Ursula is heartbroken and Janet consoles her as best as she can. Andrea later sends them a letter, along with a portrait of himself painted by Olga, thanking them for saving his life. The sisters travel to London to attend Andrea's first public performance in Britain, while the rest of the village listens in on the wireless. CastProduction The original story by William Locke was first published on 26 December 1908 in Collier's magazine, Vol.42, later appearing in book form in his short-story collection Faraway Stories (1916). Ladies in Lavender was produced by Tale Partnerships and Scala Productions, with funding by Baker Street Media Finance, Paradigm Hyde Films, and the UK Film Council. Lakeshore Entertainment handled the rights to international distribution. Filming took place in September and October 2003. Exteriors were filmed in Cadgwith, Helston, St. Ives and Prussia Cove in Cornwall. Interiors were filmed at the Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The film marked the directorial debut of actor Charles Dance. Longtime friends Maggie Smith and Judi Dench were appearing together in a play in London's West End when Dance first approached them about the project. They immediately accepted his offer without even reading the script, they said in the film featurette Ladies In Lavender: A Fairy Tale. The film was the first English-language role for German actor Daniel Br√ºhl. Release Ladies in Lavender was released nationwide in the United Kingdom on 12 November 2004. It made its North American debut at the Tribeca Film Festival on 23 April 2005. The film opened in limited release in the United States on 29 April 2005. Prior to its release in the UK, the film screened at the Taormina Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival. It was released as Les Dames de Cornouailles in France, Der Duft von Lavendel in Germany, Lavendelflickorna in Sweden, and Parfum de lavande in French-speaking Canada. Ladies in Lavender was positively received by critics. Critical response In his review in The New York Times, critic Stephen Holden wrote: \\"[Dench and Smith] sink into their roles as comfortably as house cats burrowing into a down quilt on a windswept, rainy night... This amiably far- fetched film... heralds the return of the Comfy Movie (increasingly rare nowadays), the cinematic equivalent of a visit from a cherished but increasingly dithery maiden aunt. In this fading, sentimental genre peopled with grandes dames (usually English) making 'grande' pronouncements, the world revolves around tea, gardening and misty watercolor memories.\\"New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \\"perfectly sweet and civilized... It's a pleasure to watch Smith and Dench together; their acting is so natural it could be breathing.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw observed that \\"despite a bit of shortbread-sugary emotion and an ending that fizzles out disappointingly, there's some nice period detail and decent lines in Charles Dance's directing debut,\\"The Guardian review while Philip French of The Observer commented on the \\"beautiful setting, a succession of implausible incidents, and characteristically excellent work from Smith (all suppression and stoicism) and Dench (exuding unfulfilled yearning).\\"The Observer review Peter Keough of the Boston Phoenix said, \\"This exercise in scenery and music is as innocuous as a nosegay.\\"Boston Phoenix review In the Chicago Tribune, Robert K. Elder awarded the film two out of a possible four stars and added: \\"[it] exemplifies that kind of polite, underdramatic Masterpiece Theatre staging that can either provide a surgical examination of English society or bore the pants off you. Ladies in Lavender does a bit of both... director Dance's momentum fades soon after Andrea's ankle mends, and we're left with a vague back story involving Andrea's intent to emigrate to America, though the mystery of how he ended up in Cornwall is never revisited nor revealed. [He] becomes sort of a blank character, a personality on whom we can impose our own curiosity and emotions... as compelling and original as this theme is, it's not enough to keep our attention, no matter how lovely the ladies in lavender are.\\"Chicago Tribune review Box office Ladies in Lavender grossed ¬£2,604,852 (GBP) in the UK and $6,765,081 (USD) in North America (on limited release). Its total worldwide gross was $20,377,075 (USD). Accolades Both Judi Dench and Maggie Smith were nominated for Best European Actress at the European Film Awards. Dench was nominated for the ALFS Award for British Actress of the Year by the London Film Critics Circle.

The park is on the corner of 8th Street and N Street in Downtown Sacramento, just two blocks away from the State Capitol building. Stanford Mansion The State Historic Park features the Stanford Mansion, once owned by Leland Stanford, Governor of California from 1862 to 1863, U.S. Senator from 1885 to 1893, railroad tycoon, member of the Big Four and founder of Stanford University. Prior to the reopening of the mansion, California did not have a location for the hosting of official functions for nearly 40 years. Today the mansion is frequently used by the Government of California to host foreign dignitaries. The Governor also retains an office in the mansion. Tours of the mansion are offered daily but can be impacted by official functions on behalf of the Governor's Office or the California State Legislature leadership. The mansion was designated a California Historical Landmark in 1957 and a National Historic Landmark in 1987. = History = The original owner and builder of the home was Sacramento merchant Shelton C. Fogus, a wealthy Sacramento building merchant. The Renaissance Revival architecture of the original home is attributed to Seth Babson, who later designed the E.B. Crocker residence and art gallery that are now part of the Crocker Art Museum. Stanfords Leland Stanford, president of the Central Pacific Railroad and a rising member of the Republican Party, purchased the home for $8,000 () in June 1861, shortly before his election as California governor that year. During his two-year governorship, the Stanford Mansion served as the state's executive office and living quarters. Succeeding governors Frederick Low and Henry Huntly Haight would also make the mansion their office. Between 1871 and 1872, the Stanford family embarked on an ambitious remodeling of the residence. As Stanford had had to attend his gubernatorial inauguration by rowboat in 1862, the home was raised twelve feet in response to frequent flooding from the Sacramento River. In addition, one story was added to both the bottom and top of the mansion. The home was also expanded from to , and redesigned to reflect the French Second Empire architecture popular of the period, particularly in the 4th floor Mansard roof that caps the home. The result was a four-story remodeled architectural sandwich in which the original 2-story house sat between the added floors. Following Stanford's death in 1893, his widow Jane Lathrop Stanford continued to oversee the home. Social services venue In 1900, Jane Stanford donated the home to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento to be used for the children of California. It was given to the Sisters of Mercy who ran it as an orphanage named the Stanford and Lathrop Memorial Home for Friendless Children. In 1932, the home was handed over the Sisters of Social Service who eventually transformed the mansion from an orphanage to a residence for dependent high school girls. A fire in the mansion in 1940 brought considerable damage to the fourth floor. The mansion was designated a California Historical Landmark in 1957. State historic park In 1978, the government of California acquired the property for use as a state park. The Sisters of Social Services would remain on the grounds until 1987, when California State Parks designated the mansion and the immediate surrounding land as a state historic park. Following the state's decision, the National Park Service declared the mansion as a National Historic Landmark on May 28, 1987. It was not until September 2005 that the mansion would finally be open to public tours, after $22 million worth of renovation and rehabilitation. The mansion is also the state's official reception center for leaders from around the world.  Restoration  Beginning in 1991, with the help of Sacramento businessman and former Stanford University professor Peter McCuen, the Stanford Mansion underwent a 14-year renovation at a cost of $22 million ($ million in ). Accurate restoration of the home and its rooms was aided by both an extensive study of the home in 1986 through the Historic American Buildings Survey, and through a large collection of photographs of the home taken in 1868 by Alfred A. Hart, and again in 1872 by Eadweard Muybridge. The repairs and restoration were completed in 2005, when the mansion opened to the public. California State Parks offers guided tours through the fully refurbished home. Rooms of the house have been restored to their 1872 appearance. The Leland Stanford Mansion is physically accessible, including the gardens, Visitor Center and restrooms. Elevators provide access to the upper floors of the mansion's tour route. A tactile model of the Mansion is also available in the Visitor Center.

The drug uses the monoclonal mouse IgG1 antibody ibritumomab in conjunction with the chelator tiuxetan, to which a radioactive isotope (either yttrium-90 or indium-111) is added. Tiuxetan is a modified version of DTPA whose carbon backbone contains an isothiocyanatobenzyl and a methyl group.WHO Drug Information Medical use Ibritumomab is used to treat relapsed or refractory, low grade or transformed B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a lymphoproliferative disorder, and previously untreated follicular NHL in adult patients who achieve a partial or complete response to first-line chemotherapy. The treatment should not be administered to patients with ‚â•25% lymphoma marrow involvement and/or impaired bone marrow reserve. The treatment starts with an infusions of rituximab. This may be followed by an administration of indium-111 labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan (111In replaces the 90Y component) to allow the distribution of the drug to be imaged on a gamma camera, before the actual therapy is administered. Seven to nine days later, a second infusion of rituximab is given, followed by the 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, by intravenous infusion over around 10 minutes. The radioactive activity is determined based on patient body weight and platelet count. =Mechanism of action= The antibody binds to the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B cells (but not B cell precursors), allowing radiation from the attached isotope (mostly beta emission) to kill it and some nearby cells. In addition, the antibody itself may trigger cell death via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and apoptosis. Together, these actions eliminate B cells from the body, allowing a new population of healthy B cells to develop from lymphoid stem cells. History Developed by the IDEC Pharmaceuticals, now part of Biogen Idec, ibritumomab tiuxetan was the first radioimmunotherapy drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002 to treat cancer. It was approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low‚Äëgrade or follicular B‚Äëcell non‚ÄëHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), including patients with rituximab refractory follicular NHL. It was given marketing authorisation by the European Medicines Agency in 2004 for the treatment of adult patients with rituximab relapsed or refractory CD20+ follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In September 2009, ibritumomab received approval from the FDA for an expanded label to include previously untreated patients with a chemotherapy response. Availability Ibritumomab is currently under patent protection and not available in generic form. When first approved, it was the most expensive drug available given in a single dose, costing over US$37,000 (‚Ç¨30,000) for the average dose. However, ibritumomab is essentially an entire course of lymphoma therapy which is delivered in 7‚Äì9 days, with one visit for pre-dosing Rituxan, and one visit a week later for the actual Zevalin therapeutic dose preceded by Rituxan. Compared to other monoclonal antibody treatments (many of which are well over US$40,000 for a course of therapy), it may be considered cost effective.

Its name is derived from the Greek words Œ§ŒπœÑŒ¨ŒΩ, œÑœçŒªŒøœÇ and œÄŒøœçœÇ ‚Äî \\"Titan\\", \\"knob\\" and \\"foot\\"; thus, \\"giant knobby-foot.\\" Paleobiology Titanotylopus is distinguished from other early large camelids by its large upper canines and other distinguishing dental characteristics, and absence of lacrimal vacuities in the skull. Unlike the smaller, contemporaneous Camelops, Titanotylopus had relatively broad second phalanges, suggesting that it had true padded \\"cameltoes,\\" like modern camels.Bj√∂rn Kurt√©n and Elaine Anderson Pleistoceone Mammals of North America (New York : Columbia University Press, 1980), pp. 301‚Äì302 The species Titanotylopus spatulus was characterized by broad, spatula-like incisors. It has been found at Grand View, Red Light fauna of the Love Formation, Hudspeth County, Texas, Donnelly Ranch, White Rock, Kansas, Mullen II (Kansas), Sandahl Local Fauna (Nebraska), Vallecito Creek, Colorado and 111 Ranch, Arizona in North America. Appearance Titanotylopus possessed long and massive limbs, a comparatively small braincase, and a convex slope between the eyes. Its average height was . Like modern camels, it possessed a hump for fat storage; evidence for this is provided by the long neural spines on its thoracic vertebrae. Alternate classification While some authors have considered Gigantocamelus and Titanotylopus to be congeneric, others have maintained them separately. Voorhies and Corner, based on previously unreported material, documented that the two are indeed worthy of separate generic status. Harrison (1985) followed Voorhies and Corner in advocating the use of Titanotylopus for only T. nebraskensis, based on a lower jaw, and Gigantocamelus for G. spatula, which includes G. fricki. There is a clear difference between the proximal phalanx of specimens assigned to Gigantocamelus and to Titanotylopus, based on skeletons associated with skull material.

He founded the group in 1987 after an alleged spiritual event where he claimed to have realized he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ and the Buddha. The group at one time claimed 30,000 members.

They were urged to purchase high-priced scrolls and other ornaments that were said to ward off evil, cure illnesses, deliver from sin, and break family curses. The intimidation was often accompanied by a specific threat. A victim was coerced during a number of visits by cult officials to shell out another $22,000 for a five-day training seminar at the cult's sprawling headquarters below Mount Fuji.

Hobson, is a politico‚Äìeconomic discourse about the negative financial, economic, and moral aspects of imperialism as a nationalistic business enterprise. The Taproot of Imperialism Hobson states that what he called the \\"taproot of imperialism\\" is not in nationalist pride, but in capitalist oligarchy; and, as a form of economic organization, imperialism is unnecessary and immoral, the result of the mis-distribution of wealth in a capitalist society. He argues that the so- called dysfunction of the political economy created the socio-cultural desire to extend the national markets into foreign lands, in search of profits greater than those available in the Mother Country. In the capitalist economy, rich capitalists received a disproportionately higher income than did the working class. He argues that if the owners invested their incomes to their factories, the greatly increased productive capacity would exceed the growth in demand for the products and services of said factories. As a political scientist, J.A. Hobson said that imperialism was an economic, political, and cultural practice common to nations with a capitalist economic system. Because of its innate productive capacity for generating profits, capitalism did not functionally require a large-scale, large-term, and costly socio-economic enterprise such as imperialism. A capitalist society could avoid resorting to imperialism through the radical re-distribution of the national economic resources among the society, and so increase the economic-consumption power of every citizen. After said economic adjustments, a capitalist nation did not require opening new foreign markets, and so could profitably direct the production and consumption of goods and services to the in-country markets, because \\"the home markets are capable of indefinite expansion . . . provided that the 'income', or power to demand commodities, is properly distributed\\". Influence and criticism Imperialism: A Study (1902) established Hobson's international reputation in political science. His geopolitical propositions influenced the work of prominent figures such as Nikolai Bukharin, Vladimir Lenin, and Hannah Arendt. =Influence on Marxism= In particular, Lenin drew much from Imperialism: A Study to support and substantiate Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916), which then was a contemporary, war-time analysis of the geopolitical crises of the imperial empires of Europe that culminated in the First World War (1914‚Äì18). Lenin said that Karl Kautsky had taken the idea of ultra-imperialism from the work of J.A. Hobson, and that: Moreover, Lenin ideologically disagreed with Hobson‚Äôs opinion that capitalism, as an economic system, could be separated from imperialism; instead, he proposed that, because of the economic competitions that had provoked the First World War, capitalism had come to its end as a functional socio-economic system, and that it would be replaced by pacifist socialism, in order for imperialism to end. Nevertheless, Hobson's influence in Lenin's writings became orthodoxy for all Marxist historians.Tony Brewer, Marxist theories of imperialism: a critical survey (2002) =Influence on liberalism= Hobson was also influential in liberal circles, especially the British Liberal Party.David Long, Towards a new liberal internationalism: the international theory of JA Hobson (1996). Hobson's theory of Imperialism has had many critics. Contemporary historian D. K. Fieldhouse, for example, argues that the arguments used are ultimately superficial. Fieldhouse says that the \\"obvious driving force of British expansion since 1870\\" came from explorers, missionaries, engineers, and empire-minded politicians. They had little interest in financial investments. Hobson's answer would be to say that faceless financiers manipulated everyone else, so that \\"The final determination rests with the financial power.\\" Lenin believed that capitalism was in its last stages and had been taken over by monopolists. They were no longer dynamic and sought to maintain profits by even more intensive exploitation of protected markets. Fieldhouse rejects these arguments as unfounded speculation.David K. Fieldhouse, \\"'Imperialism': An Historiographical Revision.\\" Economic History Review 14#2 (1961): 187-209. in JSTORStephen Howe, \\"David Fieldhouse and ‚ÄòImperialism‚Äô: some historiographical revisions.\\" Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History (1998) 26#2 pp: 213-232. online Historians Peter Duignan and Lewis H. Gann argue that Hobson had an enormous influence in the early 20th century among people from all over the world: :Hobson's ideas were not entirely original; however his hatred of moneyed men and monopolies, his loathing of secret compacts and public bluster, fused all existing indictments of imperialism into one coherent system....His ideas influenced German nationalist opponents of the British Empire as well as French Anglophobes and Marxists; they colored the thoughts of American liberals and isolationist critics of colonialism. In days to come they were to contribute to American distrust of Western Europe and of the British Empire. Hobson helped make the British averse to the exercise of colonial rule; he provided indigenous nationalists in Asia and Africa with the ammunition to resist rule from Europe. After 1950, Hobson's technical interpretations came under sharp criticism by scholars. His contention that economics underpinned imperialism was attacked by the historians John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson in their 1953 article \\"The Imperialism of Free Trade\\" which argued that strategic considerations and geopolitics underpinned European expansion in the 19th century. =\\"Jewish financiers\\" and racism= Hobson's writings on the Second Boer War, particularly in The War in South Africa: Its Causes and Effects, attribute the war partly to Jewish influence, including references to Rothschild bankers.John A.

The park is located east of Santa Cruz in Capitola, on Park Avenue off of Highway 1. The park is adjacent to Seacliff State Beach, which is known for its fishing pier and sunk concrete freighter, The Palo Alto. The beach overlooks Soquel Cove and Monterey Bay. History This cove was originally called China Beach after the Chinese fishermen that settled the region in the 1850s. These residents were vital to the construction of the California railroad and provided labor and food to the Santa Cruz region. By the 1870s, fisherman of other ethnicities began to enter the region, forcing out many of the Chinese residents. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 contributed to the demise of the village and by 1900, the village no longer existed and few remnants of its existence remained. During the late 1870s, Thomas Fallon began development of a small resort east of China Beach. Fallon was an immigrant from Ireland and the ex-mayor of San Jose (1859-1863). He named his campground Camp San Jose in the hopes of attracting tourists from San Jose. However, the name did not do as he had hoped and in 1882 Fallon renamed the campground New Brighton. In 1933, the state of California purchased the land where China Beach had previously been with the intention of converting the land into a state park. After its purchase, the land remained unnamed for many years, but was eventually named New Brighton State Park by the Director of State Parks. Wildlife The rocky shores of New Brighton Park are home to many wildlife inhabitants such as mussels, sea stars, barnacles, rock crabs, sea anemones, and ocean worms. Fish populations around the pier include flounder, sole, halibut, mackerel, lingcod, jacksmelt, cabezon, anchovy, perch, kingfish, steelhead, and salmon. Other animals that inhabit the park include pelicans, dolphins, sea otters, sea lions, and migrating whales. In the summer and early fall, a species of seabirds called sooty shearwaters migrate north by the thousands from southern regions as far away as New Zealand. These birds fly over the ocean in figure eights as they hunt for anchovies. Tall grasses and scrubby vegetation grow along the beach. The park is surrounded by oak trees, Monterey cypress trees, eucalyptus trees, and soaring pine trees. Wild berry vines surround the campsites of the park. Weather New Brighton Park is located in the coastal region of Santa Cruz County where the annual average high is 69 ¬∞F and the annual average low is 45 ¬∞F. The average amount of rainfall this region receives in a year is 29.0 inches. Facilities New Brighton Park has a visitor center containing exhibits and educational programs about various wildlife. Other facilities at the park include restrooms, showers, lifeguards, picnic areas, fire pits, and a dump station. The park also contains over one hundred tent and RV campsites.

The canal connected Seneca Lake at Watkins Glen to the Chemung River at Elmira, New York. It was planned to connect the Finger Lakes region and Pennsylvania's Susquehanna River watershed with New York's Erie Canal system. The latter connected the Great Lakes with the Hudson River and ultimately the Atlantic port of New York City. The state government allocated $300,000 for the construction, which started in 1830 and was completed in 1833. Opening to full service was delayed because of damage from a rainstorm in May 1833. Damage by rain and seasonal flooding was a yearly problem during the use of the canal. Forty-nine locks were needed to raise and lower barges passing through the canal. The selection of the Chemung Canal's route was a disappointment to Ithaca, New York, which had hoped to make the Erie-Susquehanna connection via Cayuga Lake. In 1854, the completion of the Junction Canal extended the length of the canal system southward from the Chemung River into Pennsylvania. A feeder canal connected the Chemung Canal to the Corning, New York area. The canal fell into disuse and disrepair by 1878, and parts of its right of way were sold off. Subsequently, the poor drainage of the canal remnants required expenditures to correct the nuisance of undrained water. Like many other canals, the Chemung Canal could not compete with the railroad companies. While it was in use, the Chemung Canal enabled coal, lumber, and agricultural products to be shipped from Pennsylvania and the Southern Tier of New York northward, where the Erie Canal could move the goods into the world market. Canal barges were towed the length of Seneca Lake from Watkins Glen to Geneva and the Cayuga and Seneca Canal system, which connected to the Erie Canal. The growth of Southern Tier cities such as Elmira and Corning was enhanced by the canal. Parts of the Catharine Valley Trail are built along old Chemung Canal towpaths.

In 1987, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \\"revealing the political and economic causes of world hunger and how citizens can help to remedy them.\\" Biography Lapp√© was born in 1944 in Pendleton, Oregon, to John and Ina Moore and grew up in Fort Worth, Texas. After graduating from Earlham College in 1966, she married toxicologist and environmentalist Dr. Marc Lapp√© in 1967. They had two children, Anthony and Anna Lapp√©. She briefly attended University of California at Berkeley for graduate studies in social work. Lapp√© has received 19 honorary doctorates from distinguished institutions, including the University of Michigan, Kenyon College, Allegheny College, Lewis and Clark College, Grinnell College and University of San Francisco. In 1987 in Sweden, Lapp√© became the fourth American to receive the Right Livelihood Award. In 2003, she received the Rachel Carson Award from the National Nutritional Foods Association. She was selected as one of twelve living \\"women whose words have changed the world\\" by the Women's National Book Association. Throughout her works Lapp√© has argued that world hunger is caused not by the lack of food but rather by the inability of hungry people to gain access to the abundance of food that exists in the world and/or food-producing resources because they are simply too poor. She has posited that our current \\"thin democracy\\" creates a mal-distribution of power and resources that inevitably creates waste and an artificial scarcity of the essentials for sustainable living. Lapp√© makes the argument that what she calls \\"living democracy,\\" i.e. democracy understood as a way of life, not merely a structure of government. The three conditions essential for democracy, she writes in Daring Democracy and elsewhere, are the wide dispersion of power, transparency, and a culture of mutual accountability, not blaming. These three conditions enable humans to experience a sense of agency, meaning, and connection, which she describes as the essence of human dignity. Democracy is not only what we do in the voting booth but involves our daily choices of what we buy and how we live. She believes that only by \\"living democracy\\" can we effectively solve today's social and environmental crisis. Lapp√© began her writing career early in life. She first gained prominence in the early 1970s with the publication of her book Diet for a Small Planet, which has sold several million copies. In 1975, with Joseph Collins, she launched the California-based Institute for Food and Development Policy (Food First) to educate Americans about the causes of world hunger. In 1990, Lapp√© co-founded the Center for Living Democracy, a 9-year initiative to accelerate the spread of democratic innovations in which regular citizens contribute to problem-solving. She served as founding editor of the Center's American News Service (1995‚Äì2000), which placed stories of citizen problem-solving in nearly half the nation's largest newspapers. Frances Moore Lapp√©'s works have been translated into 15 languages, the most recent of which is a Chinese publication of Hope‚Äôs Edge.New Chinese Publication Promotes Global Outreach of Ideas, Small Planet Institute (February 2011) In 2002, Lapp√© and her daughter Anna established the Small Planet Institute based in Cambridge, Massachusetts a collaborative network for research and popular education to bring democracy to life. With her daughter, she traveled the world and wrote Hope's Edge.The two also co-founder of the Small Planet Fund, channeling resources to democratic social movements worldwide. In 2006 she was chosen as a founding councilor of the Hamburg-based World Future Council.

Such games are identified through overall low review scores including low aggregate scores on sites such as Metacritic, frequent appearances on \\"worst games of all time\\" lists from various publications, or otherwise carry this reputation in analysis by video game journalists or through popular YouTube personalities, such as James Rolfe of the webseries Angry Video Game Nerd. The list is not comprehensive, but represents the most visible examples of games principally recognized for their enduring negative reception, or in the case of Final Fantasy XIV and No Man's Sky, at their original launch before they were reworked. The list mostly omits licensed tie-in games for movies or television shows, which are generally accepted by the industry as shovelware and not expected to have high production values as they are typically produced by non-AAA development studios. With certain exceptions, this list also omits controversial video games in which the negative reception for those games revolves around the controversies they started and is not related to the quality of the game itself, including those that were subject to review bombing by users for non-gameplay related issues. For similar reasons, the list mostly omits indie games, which are developed by smaller teams that typically lack the ability for full quality control of their product, as well as mobile games, of which there are countless developers with the ability to self-publish on app stores and frequent copycats of more successful games driven by unpopular microtransactions.  1980s  Custer's Revenge (1982) = Custer's Revenge is an unlicensed Atari 2600 game made by Mystique in 1982, loosely based on 19th century American General George Armstrong Custer and the Battle of the Little Bighorn. In addition to being widely considered offensive due to its plot involving the apparent rape of a Native American woman, the game was also poorly-received for its quality. It was listed as the most shameful game of all time by GameSpy, as the third-worst game of all time by PC World, and GameTrailers and the ninth-worst game by Seanbaby in Electronic Gaming Monthly. In 2008, the University of Calgary professor Tom Keenan cited \\"the hideous Custer's Revenge game\\", 26 years after its release, in an op-ed piece about current video game violence issues for the Calgary Herald. That same year, the game was credited by Australian PC Magazine as being one of the worst games ever made. In response to the game's criticism, the makers of the game elected to preview the game for women's and Native American groups, an act which some thought was a publicity stunt. = Pac-Man (Atari 2600) (1982) = Pac-Man, a port of the arcade game for the Atari 2600, was altered from the original in order to meet the Atari's limitations. Some of these changes included simplified graphics, a modified maze layout, and \\"flickering\\" ghosts‚Äîa result of the game rendering one ghost on screen per frame. In 1998, Next Generation magazine called it the \\"worst coin-op conversion of all time\\" and attributed the mass dissatisfaction to its poor quality. In 2006, IGN's Craig Harris echoed similar statements and listed Pac- Man among his own list of the worst home console ports of arcade games. Another IGN editor, Levi Buchanan, described it as a \\"disastrous port\\", citing the color scheme and flickering ghosts. In retrospect, critics often cite Atari's Pac-Man as a major factor in the drop of consumer confidence in the company, which led to the North American video game crash of 1983. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra stated that the game's poor quality damaged the company's reputation. Buchanan commented that it disappointed millions of fans and diminished confidence in Atari's games. Former Next Generation editor-in-chief Neil West attributes his longtime skepticism of Atari's quality to the disappointment he had from buying the game as a child. Calling the game the top video game disaster, Buchanan credits Pac-Man as a factor to the downfall of Atari and the industry in the 1980s. Author Steven Kent also attributes the game, along with Atari's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, to severely damaging the company's reputation and profitability. Montfort and Bogost stated that the game's negative reception seeded mistrust in retailers, which was reinforced by later factors that culminated in the crash. Poor critical reception made Pac-Man one of many decisions that led to Atari's report of a $536 million loss in 1983 and the split-off and sale of the company's consumer division in 1984. On December 7, 1982, Ray Kassar announced that Atari's revenue forecasts for 1982 were cut from a 50 percent increase over 1981 to a 15 percent increase. Following the announcement, then Atari parent Warner Communications' stock value dropped by around 35 percent‚Äîfrom $54 to $35‚Äîamounting to a loss of $1.3 billion in the company's market valuation. Atari attempted to regain its market share by licensing popular arcade games for its consoles. The revenue from selling these console games did not reverse Atari's decline and the company went further into debt. = E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) = E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial received significant criticism for its low-quality graphics and redundant and confusing gameplay. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial for the Atari 2600 is based on Steven Spielberg's 1982 film of the same name, reputedly coded in just five weeks to be released in time for the 1982 holiday season. The game sold 1.5 million copies and came nowhere near Atari's expectations of five million units. A large number of the cartridges sold were sent back to the company because many consumers found the game to be unenjoyable. Truckloads of these cartridges were buried in a landfill in New Mexico after they failed to sell.Wayback Machine E.T. is commonly cited as the catalyst for a crash of the video game industry in 1983, as Atari had hoped that brand loyalty would help keep consumers buying their games regardless of quality. E.T. was listed as the worst game of all time by PC World in 2006, Electronic Gaming Monthly, and FHM magazine, and was ranked as the second-worst movie game on the \\"Top Ten Worst Movie Games\\" (first being Charlie's Angels) by GameTrailers. It was also ranked the second-worst game of all time by GameTrailers, first-worst went to Superman 64. Some considered it so bad that the title screen was the only good part of the game. In 2007, GamePro named E.T. one of the 52 most important games of all time due to its roles in the 1983 video game crash and the downfall of the seemingly unstoppable Atari. It is the only game to make the list for having a negative impact on the video game industry. = Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1988) = Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a 1988 side-scrolling action video game developed by Advance Communications and published by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System loosely based on Robert Louis Stevenson's novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Gameplay alternates between the characters of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde based on the player's ability to either avoid or cause damage. While getting decent reviews when released, the game gained largely negative retrospective reviews, with reviewers criticizing bad graphics, confusing gameplay, and poor use of the characters and setting. Darrell Monti of Nintendo Life called it one of the worst games he got for the NES. In 2004, Game Informer reviewed the game in their Retro Reviews section and gave it a 5 out of 10, ending the review by saying \\"Flawed on every fundamental level, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is possibly the most unplayable garbage available on the NES.\\" In 2018, the German branch of Eurogamer placed the game at number 8 on their list of top ten worst games of the 1980s. The writers complain that nothing is explained to the player, and that some characters harm the players, but some do not. They called it a frustrating and confusing experience and said: \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde should be played by anyone who wants to learn more about good game design [ ‚Å†. ‚Å†. ‚Å†. ‚Å†] because this title makes everything so perfectly wrong that you could almost think it was deliberately designed that way.\\" The game was the first to be reviewed on the website Something Awful, gaining a score of ‚àí37 on a 0 to ‚àí50 scale, with ‚àí50 being the worst possible score. Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame declared that the \\"music and graphics are tolerable, but the controls are sluggish and the action is exceedingly dull, rendering Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde almost unplayable\\". = Friday the 13th (1989) = Friday the 13th, an adaptation of the popular horror movie franchise developed by Atlus and published by LJN for the Nintendo Entertainment System as part of its \\"aggressive\\" expansion into licensed video games, was retroactively criticized primarily for its \\"broken\\" and frustrating gameplay. GamePro listed it as the 10th worst video game adaptation of a film, explaining that \\"From the start-up screen, Jason's hockey mask sitting alone in the dark, until a knife flies in from above to pierce the empty eye socket, Friday the 13th looks like it will live up to its gory namesake. Unfortunately, what follows is a repetitive music score and amazingly frustrating gameplay, courtesy of LJN.\\"  1990s Action 52 (1991)= Action 52 is an unlicensed multicart developed by Active Enterprises for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1991. It contains 52 original games covering various genres, from shoot 'em ups to platformers. Action 52 is one of the most infamous NES games for a number of reasons. The game originally retailed for over 199 (which equates to four dollars for each game). Many of its games also have poor controls and graphics, and are plagued by bizarre glitches and technical problems; some games are impossible to complete. Kill Screen described all the games as \\"shit\\", and Atari HQ called it \\"really, horribly, incredibly bad.\\" The game frequently appears on lists compiling the worst games ever, and Atari HQ called it the worst game of all time. GameSpy named it the fifth most shameful game ever, summarizing it as an \\"endless parade of inept programming, repetitive design and outright stupidity.\\" A drastically different version of the game was also developed by FarSight Studios for the Sega Genesis; Hardcore Gaming 101 wrote it was better than the NES version, but \\"that really isn't saying much.\\" =Night Trap (1992)= Night Trap is an interactive movie video game originally published by Sega for the Sega CD in 1992. It was the first interactive movie released for the system, and had initially received mixed reviews. Critics praised its smooth video animation and humor, but disliked its shallow gameplay. The game became infamous after it was scrutinized during the 1993 United States Senate committee hearings on violence in video games, in which Senator Joe Lieberman claimed Night Trap featured gratuitous violence and promoted sexual aggression against women. The game was removed from store shelves in the United States' two largest toy store chains, Toys \\"R\\" Us and Kay-Bee Toys, after both received numerous complaints. After the controversy subsided, Night Trap was ported to multiple platforms, such as the 32X and 3DO. These ports were reviewed more harshly; critics felt the game had not aged well and considered its gameplay dull. Next Generation gave the 32X version a one-star rating and GameFan called it a \\"so-so game that got a lot more attention than it deserved.\\" Retrospectively, Night Trap was ranked one of the worst video games of all time by Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamesRadar, and Computer Gaming World. = Philips CD-i The Legend of Zelda releases (1993‚Äì1994) = Prior to the cancelled plans to release a CD-ROM add-on for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo granted Philips licenses to use some of their major characters in games for their Philips CD-i system. In addition to Hotel Mario, Philips released three games in The Legend of Zelda franchise: Link: The Faces of Evil; Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon (both 1993); and Zelda's Adventure (1994), all produced with limited involvement from Nintendo. The first two games, Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon, were developed in tandem by Animation Magic (a Russo-American animation company), using the same game engine, and were released on the same day. Both are side- scrollers where the player has to fight enemies and collect treasure to access certain levels. When first released, the games received some positive reviews;Rice, Chris, ed. NEWS: ZELDA CDi EXCLUSIVE. SNES Force. Issue 1. Pg.7. July 1993.CD TESTS: Link The Faces of Evil. Joystick. No.44. Pg.192. December 1993. however, critical re-assessment from the 2000s onward has been largely negative. The two games gained notoriety in that decade when attention was brought to their animated cutscenes, which were animated by a Russian studio; in the midst of a review of the Zelda cartoon, an IGN reviewer described the games as being \\"infamous\\" and Matthew Castle of Computer and Video Games considered the cutscenes to be \\"terrifying, rendering Link as a rubbery limbed freak with a face that swims all over his head\\". Further criticism was brought to Zelda's Adventure, a third game developed instead by Viridis, which used a top-down approach, and shifted to a live-action visual style with digitized sprites instead of a cartoon look. According to Castle, \\"what [Zelda's Adventure] lacked in hideous toons it made up for with live-action FMV-visits from a beardy wizard (not a professional actor, but the game's music composer) whose shambolic preamble makes Knightmare look like The Lord of the Rings.\\" It also suffered from poor gameplay, and a glitch preventing the game from playing both music and sound effects at the same time. Beyond the cutscenes (which soon became popular internet memes alongside Hotel Mario),The Legendarily Awful CD-i ‚ÄòZelda‚Äô Games Redone In 3-D Is Trippy Required Viewing ‚Äî UPROXX reviewers at GameTrailers have also ascribed modern negative criticism to \\"barely functional controls, lackluster gameplay, and numerous bugs\\". Danny Cowan of 1UP.com noted that Zelda fans \\"almost universally despise these games\\". The Wand of Gamelon was ranked the #6 worst video game of all time by Electronic Gaming Monthly and the #5 by GameTrailers. = Hotel Mario (1994) = Philips' deal with Nintendo for the three The Legend of Zelda games also gave them the rights to use characters from the Mario series.8 Mario Games Released On Non-Nintendo Platforms - IGN The company commissioned several games featuring Mario to be made for the CD-i; however, only one, Hotel Mario, was released. A puzzle game, Hotel Mario features animated cutscenes produced by the same Russian studio behind Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon. The game received primarily mixed reviews upon release; GamePro called the game fun to play, but believed it would bore players and would only appeal to core Mario fans. Retrospective reviews of the game, however, have been negative, with the game facing criticism for unresponsive controls and the animation of closing doors. IGN, while claiming that Hotel Mario was better than the Zelda CD-i games, slammed the game for being \\"dull\\", stating that there was \\"no reason\\" for anyone to play it. GamesRadar referred to Hotel Mario as \\"craptastic\\" and named it the 48th worst game of all time, while The Guardian called Hotel Mario a \\"horrible attempt to cash in on the full-motion-video capabilities of the useless CD-i console\\". Eurogamer claimed the game to be \\"little more than a really rubbish version of Elevator Action\\". The game's cutscenes have been subject to much ridicule; IGN compared their quality to that of Microsoft Paint. = Plumbers Don't Wear Ties (1994) = Plumbers Don't Wear Ties was released in 1994 for the 3DO console, along with a limited number of copies for PC. It was advertised as being an interactive, full motion video game; however, besides an opening cutscene, the game's story is presented through static images. The game received negative attention focused on its \\"surreal\\" and \\"sexist\\" storyline, and poor voice acting. Uproxx's Dan Seitz compared Plumbers Don't Wear Ties to a \\"Skinemax\\" movie, and felt that its constant use of still images was the \\"single saddest attempt to simulate a dream sequence ever\\". IGN felt that Plumbers Don't Wear Ties was \\"a symbol for everything that was wrong\\" with the 3DO's looser licensing program in comparison to the other major consoles (which required publishers to pay a $3 fee per disc), noting that it helped to attract smaller studios whose games \\"served to strengthen the perception that 3DO's library was riddled with crap\\". PC Gamer dubbed Plumbers Don't Wear Ties a \\"shallow, hateful waste of a game, [that] may very well be responsible for having killed the 3DO, interactive fiction, and the whale\\", naming it #1 on its \\"Must NOT Buy\\" list in May 2007. The game has been also cited as one of the primary reasons for the commercial failure of the 3DO game system. = Shaq Fu (1994) = Shaq Fu, a fighting game starring basketball player Shaquille O'Neal, received mixed reviews by critics upon its release, who praised the game's graphical style, smooth animations, and robust gameplay, but criticized the relevance of Shaq's presence in the game, along with its low difficulty and small character sprites. Allgame was similarly critical of the game, criticizing its \\"sluggish\\" controls, Shaq being nearly unrecognizable in his in-game sprites, and a \\"shallow\\" story mode with \\"cheesy\\" dialogue. Despite these mixed reviews, Shaq Fu has remained \\"collectively detested\\" by critics and gamers, and a website also exists that is solely dedicated to the location and destruction of every copy of Shaq Fu. Levi Buchanan of IGN argued that Shaq Fu had received ridicule from contemporary critics because of its connections to the phenomena surrounding O'Neal, explaining that \\"[his] ego had reached such critical mass that it developed its own gravitational pull. And when an ego gets that large, the people that fed the ego to begin with love to turn on it.\\" Buchanan acknowledged some positive aspects of Shaq Fu, such as its graphics and animation, its non-linear story progression, and its \\"charming\\" simplicity in comparison to other major fighting game franchises such as Soul and Virtua Fighter, but that it had a \\"goofy\\" story and \\"awful\\" cast. A sequel, Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn, was released on June 5, 2018. = Bubsy 3D (1996) = Bubsy 3D, a platform game in the Bubsy series for the PlayStation, was negatively received due to its disorienting camera, poor graphics, sluggish controls, and the titular character's voice clips. Upon release Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly declared it \\"my first coaster award\\", and remarked, \\"Pretend your controller is filled with mud‚Äîthis is how Bubsy plays.\\" GamesRadar named it as the video game equivalent to poorly-received films such as Plan 9 from Outer Space and Battlefield Earth. GameTrailers named it their eighth worst video game ever made and referenced it as a rip-off of Super Mario 64, which was released around the same time. Internet reviewer Seanbaby named it his 17th worst game of all time, criticizing its controls, the character's personality and the graphics. = Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero (1997) = Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero, a platform game spin-off of the Mortal Kombat franchise focusing on the main character Sub-Zero, received mixed to negative reviews for its poor controls, outdated graphical appearance, and unforgiving gameplay. Its Nintendo 64 port received further criticism for its downgraded quality, including the removal of its full motion video cutscenes that the PlayStation version used. The PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions hold aggregate scores on GameRankings of 53.20% and 44.84% respectively. Mikel Reparaz of GamesRadar opined that while the concept of giving Sub-Zero a spin- off game was interesting based on his popularity, the game \\"ended up a terrible mess of ugly sprites, cheap deaths and a button you had to hit just to change the direction you were facing, and the less that's said about it, the better.\\" Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero was listed among the worst Mortal Kombat games of all time by IGN.com, whose review noted the game's \\"dated\\" graphics, \\"stiff\\" character animations, and awkward controls with high input lag. Midway Games had planned further Mythologies games featuring different characters, but the mediocre reception resulted in their cancellation (although Mortal Kombat: Special Forces stemmed from a similar concept). = Superman (1999) = Based on the show Superman: The Animated Series, Titus Software's Superman for the Nintendo 64 (often referred to as Superman 64) has the player control Superman as he is challenged by his nemesis Lex Luthor to help save the people of Metropolis. Upon release, the game was heavily panned for its unnecessary repetitiveness, difficult and confusing objectives, poor controls, numerous glitches that interfere with gameplay, and poor graphics. Notoriously, the game has an introductory ring maze sequence that the player is given no warning about, and has a time limit that leaves nearly no room for error. The ring maze section was exacerbated by the extremely short draw distances covered by distance fog, which is explained in-game as being an aspect of the virtual reality simulation of Metropolis the game is set in, but previously described as \\"Kryptonite fog\\" by developers. Titus was harshly criticized for the poor quality of the game. Titus stated that while they had grander plans for the game, \\"the licensor killed us\\", and the final game only represents about 10% of what they wanted to include. Superman was listed as the worst game of all time by GameTrailers, the worst game on a Nintendo platform by Nintendo Power, and as the worst video game adaptation of a comic book by both GameSpy and GameDaily.  2000s  Mortal Kombat: Special Forces (2000) = Mortal Kombat: Special Forces is the second action game in the Mortal Kombat franchise released for the PlayStation in 2000 following Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero. It has received worse reviews than Mythologies, and has an average review score of only 28/100 at Metacritic, including ratings of 2.1/10 from GameSpot and 3/10 from IGN. Its sales were so low that Midway placed the series on hold in preparation for Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002). Ed Boon stated: \\"The game had a pretty bumpy development ride and the game didn't turn out very good at all.\\" In 2011, GamesRadar ranked it as the second most absurd Mortal Kombat offshoot (behind Mortal Kombat: Live Tour).Chris Antista, The Top 7‚Ä¶ Most absurd Mortal Kombat offshoots, GamesRadar, April 12, 2011. In 2013, GamesRadar also ranked it as the 41st worst game made. = The Simpsons Wrestling (2001) = The Simpsons Wrestling is a fighting game based on the animated television series The Simpsons. The game was made for the PlayStation console, was developed by Big Ape Productions, published by Electronic Arts in Europe and Activision in North America and distributed by Fox Interactive. The Simpsons Wrestling received widespread negative reviews from critics; primary criticisms for the game were directed at its simplistic, unbalanced gameplay and bad graphics. It holds an aggregated score of 41.21% on GameRankings and 32/100 on Metacritic. IGN gave the game a 1 out of 10, and declared it \\"the most horrific demolition of a license ever\\". = Batman: Dark Tomorrow (2003) = Based on the DC Comics character Batman, Batman: Dark Tomorrow received very negative reviews from critics for its confusing gameplay, repetitive mission modes, awkward camera angles, and the lack of Kevin Conroy's and Mark Hamill's voices. The end of the game was also criticized because there is no direction to the \\"fulfilling ending\\" of the story besides using an outside game guide. GameSpot gave the game a score of 2.8 out of 10, while IGN gave it a score of 2.2 out of 10 for the Xbox version and 3.5 out of 10 for the GameCube version. GameRankings gave it a score of 24.06% for the Xbox version and 27.83% for the GameCube version; while Metacritic gave it a score of 25 out of 100 for the Xbox version and 29 out of 100 for the GameCube version. A PlayStation 2 version was planned, but was cancelled due to the game's poor reception. In 2015, GamesRadar named Dark Tomorrow the 18th worst game, claiming the game's camera \\"makes Epic Mickey's look like cinematography genius\\". = Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness (2003) = Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness, the sixth installment in the Tomb Raider series, acting as a direct sequel to Tomb Raider Chronicles and The Last Revelation, received mixed to negative reviews for its poor controls, gameplay, and various bugs, although the graphics and original soundtrack were praised. IGN's Douglas C. Perry praised its \\"compelling storyline\\" and \\"set of intriguing bit characters\\", however criticized the game stating that those aspects of the game \\"pale in comparison to 90% of the PlayStation 2's adventure or action-adventure games, and they actually hurt the rest of the game's best qualities\\", but that the new moves worked smoothly apart from the stealth actions. He also added multiple examples of good level design, smooth character models, surface textures and lightning, while feeling more mixed about Lara's unrealistic figure and hardened appearance. Game Revolution's A. A. White stated that while the game's darker story was an improvement compared to its predecessors, it never \\"[managed] to build to a captivating crescendo\\", while the reviewer for GamesRadar called it \\"bountiful but confusing and ultimately of GCSE-standard creative writing.\\" Eurogamer called the controls dated and the stealth mechanics and strength upgrade system unnecessary, while the GamesRadar reviewer cited both the gameplay and control layout as dated, citing the difficulty of effectively controlling Lara at multiple points in the game because of these issues. The camera was also criticized, with gaming outlets citing it as awkward to control and sometimes wayward or confusing during its scripted movements. In 2010, GameTrailers placed the game 5th in their \\"Top 10 Worst Sequels\\" list. The Angel of Darkness caused multiple problems for the Tomb Raider franchise. Paramount Pictures faulted The Cradle of Lifes lackluster box office performance on the poor critical reception the video game received from reviewers and fans. The head of Core Design, Jeremy Heath- Smith, resigned after the release of the game, and plans for a sequel called The Lost Dominion, part of a proposed trilogy created using the game's engine, were scrapped. Following the poor performance of both the game and the second movie, Eidos Interactive took the production of Tomb Raider games away from Core Design and assigned them to Crystal Dynamics, noted as the developers of the Legacy of Kain series starting with Legend. = Drake of the 99 Dragons (2003) = Drake of the 99 Dragons holds an aggregate score of 22 on Metacritic, ranking it as the second-worst game for the original Xbox. In 2009, the game was placed as the eleventh worst received game in the last 15 years by GamesRadar. GameSpot Alex Navarro felt that the game was a \\"cacophony of terrible effects and voice acting\\"‚Äînoticing the re-use of stock sounds used in AOL Instant Messenger, and comparing the character's voice to a cross between a game show host and the \\"Moviefone guy\\". He also felt that due to the game's \\"disjointed\\" cutscenes and narration, the storyline was difficult to understand. IGN's Aaron Boulding gave the game a 2.9 out of 10; while praising the game's unique visual appearance and presentation, along with the \\"bullet time\\" audio effects while slowing down time, he concluded that Drake of the 99 Dragons was \\"a good idea that went horribly astray and ended up disastrous\\" and that \\"there's no need to rent, purchase or entertain the thought of playing this one.\\" GameSpot gave the game a lower score of 1.6, considering it \\"an out-and-out failure in every single discernable category.\\" = Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing (2003) = Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing is a racing game developed by Stellar Stone and published by GameMill Publishing. The player competes in road races with semi-trailer trucks. Big Rigs was released in a pre-alpha state: it lacks any type of collision detection, allowing players to drive through other vehicles and obstacles, and has abnormal physics, including allowing players to drive up a vertical incline or accelerate to a maximum speed of while driving in reverse before a floating- point arithmetic overflow occurs, then coming to an immediate halt once the accelerator is released. There is no computer artificial intelligence, meaning computer-controlled vehicles do not move at all during the race, thus making the game impossible to lose. It also has a number of grammatical and typographic errors, most notably the message to the player on finishing a race, \\"YOU'RE WINNER !\\". Big Rigs was listed as one of the worst games ever made by GameSpot and Computer and Video Games. After declaring it the \\"worst game ever made\\" in a \\"Games You Should Never Buy\\" segment, X-Play Morgan Webb refused to rate Big Rigs as their scale went from only 1 to 5. On aggregate reviews, it has the lowest aggregate score of any video game, with an 8/100 on Metacritic, and 3.83% on GameRankings. Stellar Stone later added movement to the opponent, though it would still stop before the finish line. Big Rigs was split from another game, Midnight Race Club, by GameMill Publishing, which had initially sought to release just one racing game stock keeping unit. =Lula 3D (2005) = The adult adventure game Lula 3D was criticized for its monotonous gameplay, poor puzzle designs, low-quality graphics (including animations, an inconsistent frame rate, and re-use of character models), its voice acting, the quality of its English translation, and low-brow humor that was too childish for its target audience. On Metacritic, the game received an aggregate score of 28% from 14 reviews. In 2013, Polygon cited Lula 3D and other \\"low-brow\\" pornographic games as a factor in the mainstream video game industry's general non-acceptance of adult video games. Jolt Online Gaming gave Lula 3D a 1.8 out of 10 for making \\"every mistake that can possibly be made by the designers of a 3D adventure\\", criticizing its poorly-implemented controls and camera, tedious gameplay involving \\"mooching around listening to Lula's terribly voiced and poorly translated descriptions of everything around you, while collecting everything you can lay your hands on\\", and voice actors compared to people auditioning to be a phone sex operator. In conclusion, Jolt felt that \\"if you like good games, Lula 3D isn't for you. If you like sexual humour, Lula 3D isn't for you. If you have no qualms about pulling yourself off at the sight of dreadfully rendered computer characters shagging, then you need to check yourself in at your local therapy centre.\\" Eurogamer gave Lula 3D a 2 out of 10, jokingly declaring that its low quality and immature humor (such as the \\"Bouncin' Boobs Technology\\" advertised on its packaging) made the game feel like it was developed by and intended for 12-year-old boys. PC Zone gave the game a 3.1 out of 10, believing that it was \\"oddly compelling\\", but \\"so inexorably, mindbogglingly ignorant of how either real games or real sex works that it spread-eagles itself a fair way into the 'so-bad-it's good' category.\\" = Ninjabread Man (2005) = Ninjabread Man, a budget game released by Data Design Interactive and published by Conspiracy Entertainment, was criticized for its poor camera, controls, graphics, and its short length; critics noted that the game could be completed in half an hour. IGN gave Ninjabread Man a 1.5 out of 10, deriding the game for being a \\"broken mess\\" and having \\"just enough character design and gameplay to cover the bullet points on the back of the box\\", but felt that Ninjabread Man still had a \\"hilarious concept\\", and jokingly praised the game for having the best box art of any Wii game. Thunderbolt similarly gave Ninjabread Man a 1 out of 10, also noting that the premise itself had potential, but that the game itself did not have any \\"glimmer of innovation\\" and \\"couldn't be a more of a generic platformer if it tried.\\" Data Design Interactive was further criticized by both Eurogamer and IGN for releasing several other games, including Anubis II, Myth Makers: Trixie in Toyland and Rock 'n' Roll Adventures, that shared the same overall engine, gameplay, and soundtrack as Ninjabread Man, but with different settings and characters. This, in turn, caused the games to exhibit exactly the same issues as Ninjabread Man. IGN felt that the games were \\"shovelware at a science\\" and representative of a bulk, quantity-over-quality approach to video game development. However, IGN still felt that Ninjabread Man had more \\"appealing\\" thematics out of the three. Eurogamer gave all four games, including Ninjabread Man, a 1 out of 10, concluding that the games were \\"dross of the highest order. Rip offs at budget price. We deserve more than this. I've heard people perking up at Ninjabread Man because of its punny name. Don't be fooled.\\" On Metacritic, Ninjabread Man has an aggregate score of 20 out of 100 from six critic reviews. = Bomberman: Act Zero (2006) = A reimagining of the Bomberman series, Bomberman: Act Zero received negative reception from critics for its long loading times, bad collision detection, forgettable soundtrack, use of the same textures and graphics for every stage, tedious and repetitive gameplay, lack of a save feature, unbalanced A.I. and the series' unwelcome shift to a darker and more futuristic setting. The \\"First-Person Bomberman\\" mode was criticized for its bad camera angles and the fact that it is played in a third-person perspective. It holds an average score of 34 from Metacritic. Yahoo! Games' Mike Smith felt that the designers did not understand what made Bomberman great. He criticized its \\"generic, gritty brushed-metal-and-armor heroes\\". GamePro Patrick Shaw felt that it should not be used to introduce players to the series, while fans of the games should skip it. Cracked.com named the game among their \\"6 Most Baffling Video Game Spinoffs\\" in 2013, commenting that the developers \\"took everything fun about Bomberman and made it crazy and depressing.\\" = Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) = Produced to celebrate the franchise's 15th anniversary and relaunch the brand for the next generation, Sonic the Hedgehog was released in late 2006 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It received unfavorable reviews from critics and casual gamers alike for its sensitive controls, poor camera angles, numerous glitches, poor storyline riddled with plot holes, voice acting, extremely lengthy loading times, and level design, while its visuals and audio received a more mixed reception. IGN stated that \\"it offers a few good ideas, and a handful of exciting moments, but none of this helps the game recover from a catastrophic loss in control\\", while GameSpot lamented the gameplay, the number of glitches, camera problems and the supporting cast, stating \\"only the most blindly reverent Sonic the Hedgehog fan could possibly squeeze any enjoyment out of Sega's latest adventure\\". GameTrailers criticized the story as well, by saying that \\"you might actually be better off reading internet fan fiction.\\" The game was ultimately listed as part of its \\"Top Ten Disappointments of the Decade\\" list. The game has a Metacritic average of 46% for the Xbox 360 version and a similar score of 43% for the PlayStation 3 version. In 2015, GamesRadar named Sonic the Hedgehog the 43rd worst game of all time, noting its \\"terrible\\" camera and \\"downright creepy\\" story. GameTrailers and GamesRadar considered Sonic the Hedgehog one of the most disappointing games of 2006. GamesTM singled out the game when it ranked the Sonic franchise at the top of their list of \\"Video Game Franchises That Lost Their Way\\". The A.V. Club, Kotaku, Game Informer, and USgamer called the game the worst in the Sonic series, and the staff of GamesRadar named it among the worst video games of all time. The game remains popular for \\"Let's Play\\" walkthroughs, with players showing off its glitches. The official Sonic Twitter account also mocks the game. The failure of Sonic the Hedgehog led to the direction of the series being rethought. The next main Sonic game, 2008's Unleashed, ignored the gritty and realistic tone of its predecessor. With Unleasheds sequel Sonic Colors (2010), The A.V. Club wrote, \\"the series rediscovered its strength for whimsical tales with light tones.\\" =Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust (2009) = Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust, the eighth installment in the Leisure Suit Larry adult-oriented adventure game franchise, was developed by Team17, and published by Codemasters‚Äîwho acquired the franchise's intellectual property from Activision Blizzard. Box Office Bust was criticized for its poor gameplay and dated graphics, incoherent story, audio and technical issues, voice acting, and poor attempts at adult humor. On Metacritic, the game's PC version holds an aggregate score of 20/100 from 17 critic reviews; its PlayStation 3 port scored lower, with 17/100 based on 11 critic reviews. IGN declared Box Office Bust to be \\"frustratingly unpolished, devoid of any kind of wit or charm, and packed with tiring, at times infuriating challenges\\", also featuring \\"uncomfortably unfunny dialogue spewed from the lips of entirely unlikable characters\\". In conclusion, it was explained that \\"the lowest rating numbers here at IGN are reserved for games with nearly no redeeming qualities or interesting ideas, with next to nothing enjoyable to offer players, and which under no circumstances should be purchased by anyone. Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust is, without a doubt, one of those games.\\" ScrewAttack, Giant Bomb, and Australian television show Good Game named Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust the worst game of 2009. Al Lowe, creator of Leisure Suit Larry, publicly thanked VU Games on his website for keeping him away from what he called \\"the latest disaster\\". = Stalin vs. Martians (2009) = Stalin vs. Martians is a parody real-time strategy video game developed by Black Wing Foundation, Dreamlore and N-Game, released on April 29, 2009. Described as \\"trashy and over-the-top\\" by its creators, the game mocks World War II strategy games and utilizes Pythonesque humor. The developers state that Stalin vs. Martians is \\"obviously a parody, which sometimes gets close to being a satire\\" and is \\"halfway to becoming a trash icon of gaming industry for years\\". In some interviews the lead designer of the game compares Stalin vs. Martians to the Troma films. Stalin vs. Martians received scathing reviews from critics. It has an average score of 23.41% on GameRankings as well as 25% on Metacritic. GameSpot named it 2009's \\"Flat-Out Worst Game\\", awarding it a rating of 1.5/10 and calling it \\"perhaps the worst RTS game ever created.\\" IGN, which rated the game a 2/10, noted the game's total lack of any RTS-related elements and asked whether it was 'made in 1994 and sealed into a vault until 2009' given how dated the visuals looked. Resolution, awarding the game 35%, warned readers not to purchase the game, but conceded that it is occasionally \\"incredibly amusing\\". = Rogue Warrior (2009) = Rogue Warrior was initially developed by Zombie Studios under the title Rogue Warrior: Black Razor: it would have been an Unreal Engine 3-based game with drop-in four-player cooperative play, and 24-player competitive multiplayer using randomly generated maps based on a unique tiling system. However, its publisher Bethesda Softworks was unsatisfied with the direction Zombie Studios was taking with the game; among other issues, citing the lack of emphasis on the personality of its protagonist Richard Marcinko. Bethesda rebooted the project with Rebellion Developments taking over development. The game was re-built from the ground up, scrapping Zombie Studios' work. Upon its release, Rogue Warrior was panned by critics for its poor controls, frequent use of profanity, short length, very limited multiplayer, and broken combat techniques. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd awarded Rogue Warrior a 2.0 out of 10, calling it \\"an absolute rip-off\\" and finding that Richard Marcinko \\"doesn't just drop an F-bomb‚Äîhe drops an entire nuclear warhead of repulsive language.\\" IGN's Jeff Hayes stated that \\"players should stay far away from this title at all costs\\" and rated it a 1.4 out of 10, criticizing its \\"laughable and barely existent\\" plot. Eurogamer's Richard Leadbetter called it \\"the worst game I've played on [PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360] for a long, long time.\\" In 2019, PC Gamer listed Rogue Warrior as being among \\"the worst PC games of all time\\", considering it \\"truly one of the worst first-person shooters in living memory\\", and akin to \\"one of those straight-to-video action movies you'd see on a DVD rack in a garage, but somehow dumber.\\"  2010s  Final Fantasy XIV (2010) = Final Fantasy XIV is a massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) in Square Enix's Final Fantasy series, developed as a spiritual successor to Final Fantasy XI. The game was released for Microsoft Windows on September 30, 2010, with plans for a PlayStation 3 port. However, the initial release of the game was met with poor reviews, with critics describing grind- heavy gameplay, poor controls, and a confusing user interface. The game holds a Metacritic score of 49/100. According to Naoki Yoshida, who took on overseeing the game's remake, the original version of Final Fantasy XIV suffered in production as there had been too much focus on the graphics quality, and little understanding of the fundamentals of a good MMORPG with the expectation that problems could be fixed with updates and patches later. Shortly after release, then-CEO of Square Enix Yoichi Wada issued an official apology for the quality of the game at the 2011 Tokyo Game Show in December 2011, saying that \\"the Final Fantasy brand [had] been greatly damaged\\". The PlayStation 3 port was cancelled, and Square Enix eventually shut off the game's servers on November 11, 2012, as to remake the game from scratch into Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. Yoshida stated that they felt it was necessary to rebuild the game from the ground up to regain the trust that they lost from fans of the series for the original game, and not strictly as a business decision. The new version was released in August 2013, and was received more positively, with an 83/100 score for the PC version on Metacritic. As of July 2019, the game continues to be supported with expansions and new content for players. = Power Gig: Rise of the SixString (2010) = Released in a market that had already been saturated by rock music- oriented music video games simulating guitar and drums, Power Gig: Rise of the SixString‚Äîdeveloped by Seven45 Studios, a subsidiary of mass-market instrument manufacturer First Act‚Äîattempted to differentiate itself from competitors such as the Rock Band and Guitar Hero franchises by shipping with an actual electric guitar that could be used in-game, rather than a simplified plastic analog (although existing guitar and drum controllers designed for the franchises could still be used with the game). As opposed to an electronic drum set with physical pads, the game offered an \\"AirStrike\\" drum controller, which utilized motion sensors placed on the ground. Upon its release, Power Gig received negative reviews from critics. The game's guitar was considered low-quality‚Äînot performing well as either a controller or standalone instrument, while the AirStrike drum controller was criticized for its poor hit detection, a reliance on proprietary, sensor-equipped drum sticks, and the lack of physical feedback contradicting the game's promoted focus on realism. The gameplay of Power Gig was criticized for being nearly identical to its competitors, even with its dedicated guitar (which only enabled the addition of basic, two-note power chords to songs), and for making little effort in providing any education on the instrument's fundamentals (in contrast to the similar \\"Pro Guitar\\" modes of its launch competitor Rock Band 3). Griffin McElroy of Joystiq pointed out that, ironically, despite \\"[centering] itself around a peripheral which is a real guitar\\", Power Gig \\"[settled] for using a new toy to manipulate an old game‚Äîbut still manages to categorically fail at both.\\" The game was also criticized for its storyline‚Äîwhich IGN declared to be \\"laughably bad\\", the exclusion of bass guitar modes, and poor-quality graphics and character animations. Power Gig holds an aggregate score of 36/100 on Metacritic, and was named the worst game of 2010 by Giant Bomb. = Postal III (2011) = Development of Postal III was subcontracted by Running with Scissors to the Russian video game publisher Akella, who hired the developer Trashmasters. They did not have the resources to develop the game to the design that the series' creators intended and thought they were able to deliver. The game ultimately received poor reviews from critics, scoring an average review score on Metacritic of 24/100. Running with Scissors pulled Postal III from its own online store, calling it an \\"unfinished mess\\" and recommending earlier installments of the franchise instead. PC Gamer gave Postal III a 21/100, joking that \\"suck and blow\\" were \\"two things that Postal III will continue to do for some hours\\", criticizing its lack of an open world design like Postal 2, poor AI, and poor attempts at being offensive (drawing comparisons to the quality of Uwe Boll's film adaptation). IGN felt that the game's technical and gameplay issues (including long loading times) were more offensive than the game's content, and criticized the lack of variety or openness in its missions. However, the game's humor, wide variety of weapons (despite most of the unique weapons not being as useful in-game as their conventional counterparts), and relatively better graphical quality than Postal 2 were regarded as positive aspects, but not enough to save the game from a 5.5/10 rating. Game Informer gave the game a 1/10, criticizing its \\"barely cobbled-together series of mostly linear levels\\", lazily using self- awareness to point out bugs that should have been fixed before release (such as a warning that an escort would \\"frustratingly disappear\\" if left behind), and concluding that there was \\"nothing redeeming about Postal IIIs frustrating, buggy gameplay.\\" In 2013, Computer and Video Games deemed it one of the 12 worst video games of all time. = FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction (2011) = FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction is a sequel of the FlatOut franchise, a vehicular combat series originally developed by Bugbear Entertainment that features realistic destruction of cars and track obstacles. After releasing FlatOut 2, Bugbear had been tapped by Bandai Namco to develop Ridge Racer Unbounded, and for the third FlatOut game, publisher Strategy First gave development duties to Team6 Game Studios. While Team6 had done numerous racing games prior, their approach to FlatOut 3 significantly changed from how Bugbear approached the title, and FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction was universally panned by critics and fans alike. The game received generally unfavorable reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. with a score of 23/100. FlatOut 3 is one of the two games Edge has ever given a score of one out of ten to in its history (the other being Kabuki Warriors). Eurogamer also gave it a one out of ten score and criticised all aspects of the game, especially the controls and the AI. It also lamented the fall from grace of the FlatOut series as a whole and summed up the review by saying, \\"You could go mad trying to rationalise Flatout 3\\\\. It is not bad in the way that a game like Boiling Point is bad, where things coalesce into a kind of awful greatness. This is a tacky and technically incompetent production with no redeeming features whatsoever, devoid of fun and an insult to the name it bears. Flatout once burned bright, but now is gone ‚Äì and if there is a driving hell, this is surely it.\\" GamesMaster also gave the game one out of ten and said, \\"Some games are so bad they're good (for a laugh, at least). FlatOut 3 is just plain bad.\\" GameSpot gave the game its highest score by giving it five out of ten, praising the Demolition mode and the wide range of game modes, but like in other reviews the AI, controls and the bad collision detection were criticised. = Infestation: Survivor Stories (2012) = Infestation: Survivor Stories, an open world multiplayer survival horror game, was publicly released as a \\"foundation release\\" in December 2012 under the name The War Z. The game received negative reception from various publications for its poor gameplay experience, and for its use of microtransactions for purchasing items and reviving characters without waiting four hours, despite the game not being a freemium \\"free-to-play\\" game. GameSpy gave The War Z a half-star out of five and considered it \\"a bad game that deserves all the controversy it's drawn\\", criticizing the broken state of the game and its use of microtransactions, but complimenting its overall atmosphere and far draw distance. IGN gave the game a 3.0 out of 10, citing that \\"the high spawn rate of weapons, as well as fear of hackers, makes the majority of player interaction in The War Z overly punishing and one-dimensional\\", and further criticized its missing features, the ability to lose purchased items, and its lack of a balance between ranged and melee weaponry. Its developer, Hammerpoint Interactive, was also accused of false advertising by players; since the game's promotional material on Steam at the time highlighted certain features that were not yet present in the game, such as multiple large game worlds varying in size (only one was available), a skill point-based leveling system (which was not yet implemented), servers supporting up to 100 players (that were actually capped at 50), and private servers. Despite this information being corrected to consider them \\"upcoming\\" features, the flood of criticism prompted Valve to pull the game from sale on Steam and offer refunds, stating that the game was accidentally made available for purchase prematurely. In an interview with PC Gamer, executive producer Sergey Titov (who was also listed as a producer for Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing) claimed that its servers were temporarily capped at 50 due to player feedback, and that its marketing team had misinterpreted information about the current state of the game. Due to its similar themes, gameplay, and title, some also felt that The War Z was a clone of the popular ARMA 2: Operation Arrowhead mod DayZ (of which a standalone version was in development); on June 20, 2013, Hammerpoint announced that the game would be renamed Infestation: Survivor Stories, \\"primarily as a result of some confusion and trademark issues with a similarly titled property\\" (a statement which also factored in a conflict with the film World War Z). = SimCity (2013) = SimCity, developed by Maxis and Electronic Arts (EA), was aimed to augment the normally single-player city-building game with online features that would allow players' cities to interact with one another, building a software platform rather than a single game. The game was released in March 2013, but there was no offline mode, and the servers for online connectivity were over capacity, requiring players to wait upwards of thirty minutes to play for several weeks following launch. EA and Maxis eventually resolved server issues by expanding capacity and disabling certain \\"non- critical\\" features. Users also found that promised improvements to the artificial intelligence were not present, and that the available land for city building was much more restrictive than previous iterations. Users were further critical when it was found that the game could be run in an offline mode using special debugging commands, to which Maxis responded saying that they opted against an offline mode as \\"it didn't fit with our vision\\". By October 2013, EA and Maxis discussed the possibility of adding an offline mode, and a year after release, the game was updated to support this. The game received lukewarm reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 64/100 from Metacritic, but was hit hard with many negative user reviews. The initial server issues created enough negative user reviews at retailer Amazon.com that the retailer temporarily halted sales of the game for a few days. While some users that purchased retail editions of the game were able to get refunds, those that had purchased it digitally through EA's Origin service could not get refunds, and instead EA offered users a choice of one free game from eight offerings as to make up for the server issues. EA was named as the \\"Worst Company in America\\" in a 2013 Consumerist user-voted poll, with the debacle over SimCity service launch as part of the reason some voted this way. As a result of the poor reception to the game, Electronic Arts shuttered Maxis' main Emeryville, California studio by 2015, transferring Maxis' other franchises like The Sims to other EA studios. Separately, Colossal Order, a studio under Paradox Interactive, had been wanting to make a city simulator for some time, but Paradox had been hesitant of SimCity influence on the market. Following the failure of SimCity, Paradox greenlit Colossal Order's Cities: Skylines, which was released in 2015. By contrast, Cities: Skylines was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, with some outlets considering the game to have succeeded SimCity as the game most representative of the genre. = Aliens: Colonial Marines (2013) = Aliens: Colonial Marines, a first-person shooter developed by Gearbox Software and set in the universe of the Alien franchise, was criticized at launch for containing bugs, poorly-implemented A.I., unbalanced gameplay, low-quality graphics, and a poorly-implemented co-op mode. A couple of said issues have since been adjusted or fixed to a certain degree. The game's story also drew criticism for its lack of a consistent continuity with the Alien films, despite claims from the developers that the events of the game were supposed to be canon to the film series. Particular criticism was directed towards discrepancies in the game's quality between pre-release builds demonstrated at events and in promotional materials‚Äîthe former purporting to feature \\"actual gameplay\\", and the final product, including lower graphics quality, missing levels, and other regressions. Shortly after the game's release and the discovery of these regressions, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford acknowledged the issues and stated that the studio would look into them. It was reported that, as is common practice, the demo was optimized for high-end PC hardware, and that after the game was returned from its subcontractor TimeGate Studios to Gearbox, the studio made changes to optimize the game's performance for consoles. In April 2013, a class action lawsuit was filed against Gearbox Software and the game's publisher, Sega. The suit argued that these differences, along with a press embargo on publishing reviews of the final product until its release date, deceived those who pre-ordered the game based on the pre-release promotional materials, amounting to false advertising. In September 2014, Sega agreed to pay a tentative settlement of $1.25 million. In July 2018, a mod developer reviewing the game's code found that a typo in its configuration files resulted in the poor artificial intelligence shown by the game's enemies observed at its original release; manually correcting the error led to the enemies having more consistent behavior with press material as well as the Aliens from the film franchise. = Ride to Hell: Retribution (2013) = Announced in 2008 as a Grand Theft Auto-styled game set during the late 1960s, the eventual release of Ride to Hell: Retribution in June 2013 was universally panned by critics. In particular, Ride to Hell was criticized for its largely broken gameplay, poorly-implemented controls, poor voice acting and writing, its negative portrayal of women, and for dropping the originally announced open-world format in favor of a linear structure. Daniel Starkey of GameSpot considered Ride to Hell: Retribution to be \\"painfully insubstantial\\" and broken all-around, criticizing its plot for showing a \\"pathetic, out-of-touch approach to sex, violence, and masculinity\\", and believing that its developers were showing a lack of respect towards players due to the game's abysmal quality. Describing it as the newest candidate for \\"Worst Game of All Time\\", Starkey gave Ride to Hell a 1.0 out of 10, making it only the second game (behind Big Rigs) to receive GameSpot's lowest possible rating. EGM described Ride to Hell as being \\"a linear, insultingly underdeveloped mess\\" with \\"endlessly clunky gameplay\\" and numerous bugs and glitches, concluding that \\"other games may have offered less content for more money or come up shorter in specific, individual areas, but I don't think there's ever been a game that does so many things so universally poorly\\", giving the game 0.5 out of 10. In his annual \\"Top and Bottom 5\\" awards, Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw of Zero Punctuation laid out his bottom 5 (in which Ride to Hell was not included) before moving into a coda in which he explained, \\"I was hesitant to place it even on a worst games list, 'cos it's not a game, it's congealed failure. I speak no hyperbole when I say that releasing every box with no disc inside would have been less of a mistake. So for one time only, I grant the Zero Punctuation Lifetime Achievement Award for Total Abhorrence to Ride to Hell: Retribution, which it will hold indefinitely until a worse game comes along.\\" The game has a Metacritic score of 19 out of 100, based on 14 reviews of the Xbox 360 version. It is the third lowest scoring game on the Xbox 360, and the lowest scoring retail Xbox 360 game. It received a 13 out of 100 score from Metacritic for the PS3 version, making it the lowest-scoring PS3 game. = Double Dragon II: Wander of the Dragons (2013) = Double Dragon II: Wander of the Dragons is a 3D beat 'em up game loosely based on the arcade version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge, developed by Korean game studio GRAVITY and published by Barunson Creative Co. Ltd. The title was first announced in 2011, but was shelved for release for two years. It was eventually released on April 5, 2013 as a digital download for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Arcade service. It received extremely negative reviews, holding a score of 15.83% on GameRankings (making it the third-worst reviewed game on the site only behind Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing and Ride to Hell: Retribution) and a score of 17 on Metacritic, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". GamesRadar ranked it as the 42nd worst game ever made, comparing it unfavorably to the previous Double Dragon Neon. Metro gave it a 1/10 score and called it the \\"worst game ever\\". = Dungeon Keeper (2014) = Dungeon Keeper is a freemium MMO strategy video game developed by Mythic Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts for the iOS and Android platforms. It was intended to serve as a reboot of the Dungeon Keeper series directed and designed by Peter Molyneux. The game was heavily panned due to its monetization practices. For example, critics condemned the time the Gem Veins take to dig, which forces players to either wait for varying amounts of time or purchase Gems with real money, practices that were not present in the original Dungeon Keeper games. The Metacritic score for the iOS version is a 42/100. IGN rewarded the game a 3/10, Eurogamer rewarded the game a 1/10, and Metro rewarded the game a 0/10. The game was deemed \\"unplayable\\" by some critics. Molyneux criticized the game's monetization implementations as well, describing them as \\"ridiculous\\". The criticisms of the game were exacerbated when Electronic Arts was accused of censoring user ratings lower than five stars by making those players email them instead the next month. The British Advertising Standards Authority soon ruled that Electronic Arts' advertising of the \\"free\\" nature of the game misled customers, ordered the creation of fine print explaining the in-app purchases, and banned the original adverts. = Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric (2014) = Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric is a 2014 spin-off from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise developed by Big Red Button Entertainment‚Äîa studio co- founded by Naughty Dog alumni E. Daniel Arey and Bob Rafei‚Äîand published by Sega for the Wii U. The game was released alongside a tie-in game for the Nintendo 3DS developed by Sanzaru Games known as Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal. Although both games received generally negative reviews from critics, Rise of Lyric has been heavily derided for its numerous bugs and glitches, poor graphics and level design, over-simplistic gameplay, and bad writing. On Metacritic, the game holds an aggregate score of 32 from 28 critic reviews. Don Saas of GameSpot noted that \\"through a combination of unwieldy controls, a broken camera system, and a total lack of responsiveness, the platforming and exploration elements of Rise of Lyric are totally unworkable.\\" Metro GameCentral considered Rise of Lyric to be \\"definitely the worst game of 2014\\", citing \\"a terrible camera, awful controls, unspeakably dull combat, insipid level design, ugly character art, broken graphics, serious bugs, and the terrible feeling that Sega hates both you and Sonic.\\" Both Metro and Nintendo World Report referred to it as potentially the worst Sonic game of all time. Both games were commercial failures. In February 2015, Sega announced that Rise of Lyric and Shattered Crystal had moved 490,000 units combined, making them the worst-selling games in the history of the franchise. Sanzaru Games has developed another 3DS title known as Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice, which was released in 2016 to mixed reviews, although it was considered an improvement over Rise of Lyric and Shattered Crystal. =Alone in the Dark: Illumination (2015)= The sixth installment in the Alone in the Dark franchise was published by Atari in 2015 centering around a team of four cooperative characters investigating a mysterious figure in a haunted house. Alone in the Dark: Illumination received universally negative reviews. It received an aggregated score of 19% on GameRankings based on 5 reviews and 19/100 on Metacritic based on 12 reviews plus ranked as the worst game of 2015. Jim Sterling stated that Illumination was \\"ugly in every sense of the word, not just visually ‚Äì though it is about as attractive as an anus in an eye socket\\", while criticizing its cooperative play and the mechanic of using light sources to defeat enemies. =Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 (2015)= A revival of the Tony Hawk's franchise developed by Robomodo, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 was panned for its poor quality, especially in comparison to its predecessors, with reviews citing various performance issues, environmental clipping, and physics issues. The game's environments were criticized for their poor aesthetics, unmemorable level themes, small size, dull challenge tasks, lack of NPCs, and for not containing as many hidden secrets as those in previous Tony Hawk games. Before the game was released, the licensing deal between Activision and Tony Hawk was set to expire. As a result, the game was hastily developed within a few months and released unfinished with little promotion. The nature of the game's online modes were criticized for providing little incentive to players and exacerbating the game's performance issues. Pro Skater 5 would be the last major game in the series until the release of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, a remaster of the first two games, in 2020. IGN gave the game a 3.5 out of 10, concluding that \\"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 rare moments of nostalgic joy are drowned out by its abundance of poorly thought out levels, control problems, bugs, and its glaring lack of attitude. It boggles the mind that a $60 game in 2015 can be riddled with so many technical issues.\\" Giving Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 a 3 out of 10, GameSpot argued that \\"within THPS5 lies a basic skating game that's difficult to enjoy, because you have to jump over numerous hoops and ignore a plethora of obvious issues to find the smallest amount of fun.\\" Polygon named Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 one of the worst games of 2015, stating that it was \\"so broken, so garish and so grim that reformed Tony Hawk lovers rue the day they first laid eyes on the franchise. Sometimes, it's better to leave what's past in the past.\\" = Umbrella Corps (2016) = Umbrella Corps is a tactical shooter spinoff of the Resident Evil franchise released for the PlayStation 4 and PC, and has been panned for its poor gameplay mechanics. IGN's Brian Albert rated the game 3.8 out of 10: \\"[The] balance is absurd, controls are clumsy, and it fails to pull anything meaningful from the Resident Evil universe\\". Peter Brown of GameSpot rated it 3/10: \\"Umbrella Corps is a forgettable game dominated by bland action and half-baked mechanics.\\" Zach Furniss of Destructoid lambasted the game as \\"a broken sludgy mess that fails in just about every way.\\" Game Rants John Jacques wrote in his review, \\"The game doesn't know what it wants to be, and as a result, this is another lackluster spinoff from Capcom‚Äîone we're eager to forget.\\" Ben Reeves of Game Informer commented, \\"Thanks to all of its flaws, Umbrella Corps feels like a grotesque online oddity that everyone should just ignore‚Äîwhich everyone is already doing.\\" Cade Onder of GameZone labeled the game \\"the worst entry in the Resident Evil franchise since 6,\\" citing its \\"clumsy and even confusing\\" gameplay. Russ Frushtick of Polygon remarked that \\"the controls feel like you're walking on ice skates. It's abysmal.\\" In 2017, The Telegraph Olivia White rated it the worst game in the Resident Evil series, while PC Gamer ranked it the second-worst game in the franchise for its \\"straight up broken\\" controls, which they deemed \\"unforgivable\\". Umbrella Corps holds a rating of 38 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 55 reviews. = No Man's Sky (2016) = No Man's Sky was announced in 2013 as a space exploration game that features over 18 quintillion planets in its virtual universe each with their own set of flora and fauna, all formed in-game through procedural generation. The game, developed by a small team from Hello Games, quickly gained significant attention and media hype across the gaming media due to its expansive goals, which was boosted further when Sony announced it would help to publish the game for the PlayStation 4 alongside a Microsoft Windows version. Sean Murray, a co-founder of Hello Games and the lead developer for No Man's Sky, gave numerous interviews over the following years during development, explaining features they had planned for the game including multiplayer. Just prior to No Man's Sky August 2016 release, early- released copies revealed that some of the expected gameplay features did not appear present in the game, and were still missing following a day-zero patch. Specifically, there appeared to be no multiplayer, and other features demonstrated in promotional videos and Murray's interviews were absent. Atop this, players found the game lacked a quality of procedural uniqueness (in that there was little overall variation in the planets relative to the scale of the game), and the gameplay elements necessary to explore were tedious. Though Murray had tried to set expectations prior to release, the game received a wide range of reviews and generally negative reviews from players. Negative player reception was compounded by the apparent lack of communication from Hello Games towards these issues, with the team only reporting on bug fixes and performance improvements that they released. Murray later admitted that their initial silence post-release had come about due to drastically underestimating the player size they had to support at the start. Hello Games has since released several major updates to the game to incorporate some of these missing features, including multiplayer modes, as well as other significant additions which have been met with praise, bringing the game to a state that they had expected prior to its launch and grown beyond that. The game is considered a key reminder of what to avoid in marketing a game, with many commentators discussing the proper means to generate interest in games \\"in a post-No Man's Sky world\\". =Star Wars Battlefront II (2017)= Star Wars Battlefront II, primarily an online multiplayer shooter, was developed by EA DICE as a sequel to the 2015 game. One element that EA had sought to change was how microtransactions would be handled; the first game offered additional characters and settings through downloadable content, but EA found that this segmented the player community between those who had purchased the additional content and those who had not. Instead, EA opted to use loot box mechanics (called Star Crates in-game) believing this would help maintain its player community; players could earn Star Crates, containing a random collection of in-game items distributed by rarity, over time by playing the game, but could also spend real-world funds to acquire these. While such loot crates were an established mechanism in video games, the approach used by Battlefront II during its pre-launch beta period was found to be problematic to players. Star Crates not only contained gameplay-altering elements, thus seen as \\"pay-to- win\\", but also was the fastest way to unlock the more popular Star Wars characters rather than acquiring them through hours of gameplay. Players and some journalists were vocal about these concerns, which were coupled with general negative attention drawn to loot box mechanics in 2017 from other video games. Just prior to the game's planned launch in November 2017, Disney (who owned the rights to Star Wars) contacted EA over the situation, leading EA to disable any of the microtransaction processes indefinitely until they could work out a solution. The new system was put in place by March 2018, addressing both key concerns. While Battlefront II received mixed reviews from critics, the negative perception of the game by the player base troubled EA's stockholders, and within a week of its November 2017 release, EA's stock market value dropped by , attributed to the Battlefront II loot box backlash. In its Q4 2017 quarterly financials, EA stated that Battlefront II had missed their sales expectation by at least 10%, which EA's CFO Blake Jorgensen attributed to the player base reaction to how EA had implemented and handled the loot box issue. The attention generated by Battlefront IIs loot crates also drew worldwide government and industry responses in late 2017 and beyond to evaluate whether loot box mechanics in video games were a form of gambling particularly to minors and the potential need for regulations. =Fallout 76 (2018)= Fallout 76 is an online action role-playing game in the Fallout series. Developed by Bethesda Game Studios, Fallout 76 represented the studio's first foray for a fully online game, as well as the first time multiplayer is included in a Fallout game developed by Bethesda Studios. Fallout 76s Metacritic scores across PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One platforms have an average of about 51/100, with user reviews being far more critical of the game. The game shipped with a large number of bugs and glitches, and Bethesda's early patches to fix these were large and at times, reintroduced bugs that had previously been fixed. Other complaints from players focused on the expensive pricing of in-game cosmetics, as well as introducing items that gave gameplay advantages which could similarly be bought with real money. Additionally, there was criticism for Bethesda's attitude towards players using mods, regardless of whether their intentions were harmful or not, as well as the game's lack of sufficient anti-cheat protection due to large-scale examples of hacking. Like No Man's Sky, Bethesda had not been as communicative of its efforts to improve the game following release, leading to further consternation within the player base. The choice to include a premium subscription service in October 2019 was met with criticism as players had expected some of the exclusive features to have been provided for free. The service was also hampered by bugs upon release, including one that deleted all items from the Scrapbox, an item \\"Fallout 1st\\" players receive that allows unlimited storage of building materials. Bethesda has since addressed those bugs and gave any players thought to be affected by the Scrapbox bug free in- game materials as an apology. Several promotional facets of Fallout 76 failed to meet original expectations. As part of the game's premium physical content, the promotional canvas bag and an alcoholic beverage bottle were found to not match the original product descriptions as shipped, while thousands of Fallout-themed helmets were recalled due to containing dangerous levels of mold. By 2020, Bethesda's work to improve the game has garnered more positive praise from its users. On its release to Steam in April of that year, its users worked to fight a review bomb by posting positive reviews and experiences of the game since release. =WWE 2K20 (2019)= WWE 2K20 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K Sports in 2019, part of the ongoing WWE series of video games based on the WWE sporting franchise. The series had traditionally been developed by Yuke's and published by THQ. THQ went bankrupt in 2012, and 2K acquired the WWE property then. 2K kept Yuke's on as the lead developer and had assigned Visual Concepts, an internal studio with several years of experience in sports simulation games, to assist. Yuke's role in development was gradually diminished over the years, and they were removed as the lead developers for WWE 2K20, though affirmed they would provide Visual Concepts and 2K with support for the game's engine while they pursued a new wrestling IP. Visual Concept considered this gave them freedom to explore new options for the game that they felt Yuke's had been holding them back on. The game received \\"generally unfavorable\\" reviews on all platforms according to review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers and players alike found numerous glitches resulting from the game engine which were attributed to the removal of Yuke's from the development of the title, and the hashtag #FixWWE2K20 began trending across social media. At the start of 2020, the game was rendered almost unplayable due to a \\"Y2k20\\" bug. As a result, plans for a WWE 2K21 game were cancelled by March 2020 according to the WWE. Justin Leeper, a former writer for the series, stated that a combination of development problems with Visual Studios without Yuke's and poor sales, in addition to issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, led 2K to put the series on hold, but in favor of a different style of WWE game as a replacement from a different studio. 2K announced this spin- off title, WWE 2K Battlegrounds, being developed by Saber Interactive, as an arcade-action, \\"over-the-top\\" game.

Some of Kharaosta's known coins write Ortas instead of Artas. Scholars state that Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio of the Lion Capital Inscriptions is the same as Kshatrapa Kharaosta, whose coins have been studied by Dr Rapson and Dr Luders. It is now generally agreed that Kshatrapa Kharaosta was son Arta, and that Yuvaraja Kharaosta and Kshatrapa Kharaosta were one and same historical personage.Kshatrapasa pra Kharaostasa Artasa putrasa (i.e. Kshatrapa Kharaosta, son of Arta), Political History of ancient India, 1996, p 397/98, Dr Raychaudhury; See also: History and Culture of Indian People, The age of Imperial Unity, p 164, (Editors) Dr R.

See also: . An older view was that Arta, the father of Kharaosta, was the first husband of Rajuvula's chief queen who had married Rajuvula after Arta's death. However, Dr S Konow does not accept this view. The fact that last name Kamuia has been used both by Yuvaraja Kharaosta as well as by princess Aiyasi clearly proves that Aiyasi Kamuia was the daughter and not mother of Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio, since it is the father's and not mother's lineage which is adopted by their off-springs.Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol II, part I, p 36 & xxxvi, Dr Stein Konow; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 1990, p 141, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland; PrƒÅcƒ´na Kamboja, jana aura janapada =: Ancient Kamboja, people and country, 1981, p 227/228, Dr JiyƒÅlƒÅla KƒÅmboja, Dr Satyavrat ≈öƒÅstrƒ´. It appears that Arta (Artas, Ortas) had died before the date of writing of the Mathura Lion Capital inscriptions. Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio, therefore, was the legitimate inheritor to the position as King of Kings for the kingdom of Gandhara after king Moga.See: Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol II, part I, p 36 & xxxvi, Dr Stein Konow; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 1990, p 141, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland; PrƒÅcƒ´na Kamboja, jana aura janapada =: Ancient Kamboja, people and country, 1981, p 227/228, Dr JiyƒÅlƒÅla KƒÅmboja, Dr Satyavrat ≈öƒÅstrƒ´; Political History of Ancient India, 1996, p 397, Dr H. C. Raychaudhury. Saka governor Rajuvula had married princess Aiyasi Kamuia, daughter of Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio, probably to strengthen his political position and also his claim to the throne (of Taxila).Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol II, Part I, p 36 & xxxvi; Ancient India, 1956, p 220, Dr Radha Kumud Mookerji; PrƒÅcƒ´na Kamboja, jana aura janapada =: Ancient Kamboja, people and country, 1981, p 227/228, Dr JiyƒÅlƒÅla KƒÅmboja, Dr Satyavrat ≈öƒÅstrƒ´; See quote in: Early Inscriptions of MathurƒÅ: A Study, 1980, p 27, K. Das. This prospect was obviously not liked by other Saka chiefs. This appears to be the reason as to why the title of Shahanshahi was discontinued and only the titles of Kshatrapa and Mahakshtarpa obtained among the Sakas from that time onwards.PrƒÅcƒ´na Kamboja, jana aura janapada =: Ancient Kamboja, people and country, 1981, p 227/228, Dr JiyƒÅlƒÅla KƒÅmboja, Dr Satyavrat ≈öƒÅstrƒ´. These Sakas later organized a Samgha under Rajuvula and Patika when Rajuvula assumed the title of Maha- Ksatrapa for the first time. It appears, for some reasons, that Yuvaraja Kharaosta Kamuio did not avail the position of King of Kings after Moga's death. Many scholars including Sten Konow, H. W. Bailey, R. K. Mukerjee, K. P. Jaiswal, J. L. Kamboj, Buddha Prakash and others recognise that the names Kamuia and Kamuio (q.v) of the Mathura Lion Capital Inscriptions are the Kharoshthi/Prakritic forms of Sanskrit/Pali Kambojika or Kamboja.Khroshthi Inscriptions, No 15, A3; Notes on Indo-Scythian chronology, Journal of Indian History, xii, 21; Corpus Inscrioptionum Indicarum, Vol II, Part I, pp xxxvi, 36, Dr. S. Konow e.g: \\"If we bear in mind that 'mb' becomes 'm', i.e mm in the dialect of the Kharoshthi Dhammapada and that common 'o' becomes 'u' as in Sudasa, then Kamuia may very well represent Sanskrit Kambojika\\" (Dr Konow); cf: \\"The Kamuiyas, who are associated with the family of the Saka Mahakshatrapa Rajuvula of the Mathura Lion Capital inscriptions, are in fact, the Kambojas, Kamuias being just the form we would expect in the dialect for an old Kambojika\\" (Indian Culture, 1934, p 193, Indian Research Institute); Cf: \\"Dr Stein Konow‚Äôs recognition of Kamuia, occurring in the Lion Capital Inscription of Mathura, as = Kambojika is convincing‚Äù‚Ä¶See: Bihar and Orissa Research Society, Vol XVI, 1930, part III and IV, p 229, Dr K.

The stations serve Beaver County, Pennsylvania and simulcast their programming. The stations are owned by Mark and Cynthia Peterson, through licensee Sound Ideas Media, LLC. WBVP operates at 1230 kHz with an ERP of 1 kW-Unlimited power and is licensed to Beaver Falls, while WMBA operates at 1460 kHz with an ERP of 500 W-Unlimited power and is licensed to Ambridge, Pennsylvania. History WBVP (Beaver Falls, PA) started broadcasting on May 25, 1948 and was founded by a threesome from Pittsburgh, PA including Tom Price, Frank Smith and Charles Ondurka. In 1955, The original partners reorganized and formed Beaver Valley Broadcasting. Around 1970, Hall Communications bought WBVP along with an FM radio station, originally known as WBVP - FM at 106.7 mHz, that had been put on the air in 1968. In 1985, Ted and Marilee Ruscitti from Hopewell township, PA bought WBVP and the FM station, that by this point in time the call letters had been changed and it was known as WWKS, through their company, MT Communications. In 1990, The stations were sold to the Baltimore Radio Show out of Towson, MD with Harry Shriver serving as managing partner. Carnegie, PA native Frank Iorio, Jr., along with partners Aaron Daniels and Mike Swartz formed Pittsburgh Radio Partners and bought the two stations in 1994. Just a year later, the trio sold the FM station, WWKS, to Secret Communications and at that time Iorio bought out his partners and continued to own and operate WBVP through his newly formed company, Iorio Broadcasting, Inc. Iorio then bought WMBA (Ambridge, PA) from Donn Communications in 2000. Long time station employee, Mark Peterson along with his wife, Cyndi, Formed Sound Ideas Media, LLC, and purchased WBVP and WMBA in 2014. In 2019, an F.M. translator station, for WBVP, W257EA, at 99.3 was put on the air and added as a third station carrying the simulcast feed already aired on WBVP and WMBA. The following year, the stations debuted full time on line audio streaming via the station's website. WBVP and WMBA competed for over 40 years, going back to when WMBA first went on the air in 1957. Miners Broadcasting Service, Inc., headquartered in Pottsville, PA, put WMBA on the air as a 500 watt day timer with its towers located in Bell Acres, PA and studio in Ambridge, PA. The station was sold in 1970 to John Bride, a former Pittsburgh television advertising salesman. His Bride Broadcasting, Inc. instituted a more contemporary format, including local talk shows and Top 40 music after 4 p.m. during the week and on weekends. Bride continued to own and operate the station even after he moved his base of operations to Maine, where he owned other radio stations. Bride finally sold the station to Donn Communications in 1986 and the studios and offices moved from a converted house at 291 14th Street in Ambridge to a storefront at 761 Merchant Street in Ambridge's business district. In 1988, FCC approval was granted and new towers were constructed at the transmitter site to allow for WMBA to broadcast 24 hours a day. In 1960, WBVP was joined by a 16,500 watt F.M. sister station that was first known as WBVP-F.M.and located at 106.7 Mhz. The station underwent a huge transformation in 1975. It gained approval from the FCC to increase power to 47,000 watts and broadcast from a much taller, newly constructed, 517' guyed tower in Pulaski Township, PA. The metamorphosis also included getting new call letters, WWKS, and becoming best known throughout the 70's and 80's as \\"Kiss FM\\". In 1994, WWKS switched to a hard rock format and became branded as \\"The Force\\". The combination of the station beginning to attract larger audiences and more advertising dollars, along with the FCC relaxation of station ownership rules in the mid nineties, made it a very attractive acquisition for another radio group operating stations in Pittsburgh. That led to WWKS being separated from WBVP in 1995, when Pittsburgh Radio Partners sold the asset to Secret Communications, eventually becoming part of Clear Channel Communications. After a couple more transactions, call letters and format changes through the years, today it is operated by St. John's Mission as Pittsburgh station WAOB-FM. Following the 1995 sale of WWKS, WBVP was sold in a spin-off transaction to Frank Iorio, Jr, and his company Iorio Broadcasting, Inc. Iorio, Jr. was one of the partners involved with Pittsburgh Radio Partners. For the next 24 years, there would be no F.M. broadcasting at the stations' headquarters in Beaver Falls, PA. That changed in August 2019, when a translator station for WBVP, (W257EA) at 99.3 F.M., was added to the mix. The new F.M. allocation broadcasts at a height of 492' mounted to same Pulaski Township tower. All three radio stations, 1230 WBVP, 1460 WMBA and 99.3 F.M. continue to simulcast a wide variety of local news, sports and talk programming. Merger with WMBA In May 2000, WMBA owner Donn Wuycik, president of Donn Communications, entered into an agreement to sell WMBA to Iorio Broadcasting, for an undisclosed amount. Since 2000, though, they have been under single ownership and WMBA's operations were moved from 761 Merchant Street in Ambridge into WBVP's existing facilities at 1316 Seventh Avenue in Beaver Falls. WBVP and WMBA, which aired separate talk formats with nostalgia and adult contemporary music, respectively, began to duplicate more of each other's programming as time evolved, and today the stations are nearly 100 percent simulcast. The exceptions are usually confined to high school sports, where each station will air live play-by-play of a game significant to its community. Frank Iorio wanted to concentrate on his new Pittsburgh acquisition, WJAS, a transaction which he would successfully complete in the summer of 2014. Longtime WBVP and WMBA general manager Mark Peterson had aspired to acquire a station of his own, and Iorio arranged to sell the station to Peterson and his wife. Both WBVP and WMBA were sold to Peterson's newly formed company, Sound Ideas Media, LLC for $750,000 in a transaction that was consummated on February 28, 2014. WBVP and WMBA today WBVP and WMBA are generally live and local from 6 a.m. until 1 p.m. on weekdays. The local programming centers around news and talk shows. The remainder of the broadcast day is then usually filled with syndicated programming. In recent years, both stations have aired play-by-play of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Pittsburgh Pirates games. Both stations have served as a springboard for on-air personnel who have moved on to bigger stations, and that trend continues today. Among the WBVP alumni are Bob Alexander, Alan Boal, Jim Reynolds, Chris Shovlin (Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame), Bill Kelly, Sam Nicotero (known as Tony Scott on WBVP), Earl Lewis, Justin McKim, Ken Mueller, Randy Buckwalter, Carl Anderson, Mark Razz (Radziewicz), Gert Trobe, Mike Romigh, George Allen, Owen Simon, Sam Siple, Chuck Wilson (Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame), Don Kennedy (Big Band Jump), Ernie Kline, who later became Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, Bob Barrickman (Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame) and Tom Hays (Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame). Among those who served at WMBA are Bob Pompeani (Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame), Jim Merkel, Guy Junker, Ted Ruscitti (who owned WBVP during the 80's), Jim Ladd, Kevin Maguire, Ray Fallen, Woody Lester, Dave Stevens (Posmoga), Rick Pantale (Pantaleo), Dave Justice (Benard), T.J. Jamison (Jim Green), Dave Denniston, Roy Angst, Frank Greenlee, John Poister, Tim Herrera, Rick Bergman, Al McDowell, Julie Bologna, Randy Cosgrove, Don Shields, Debbie Smith (Debbie Kwei), Dan Dunlap, Gene Romano and John Mehno. Other notable WMBA staffers include Rob Matzie, who in 2008, was elected as a State Representative in Pennsylvania's 16th District.

The station broadcasts on 1550 kHz with a power of 1,000 watts daytime (4 watts at night) from studios in South Park PA, and is licensed to Braddock, Pennsylvania. Programming Before changing to Jazz as WZUM, 1550's programming was provided by a format developed by veteran Pittsburgh radio programmer Clarke Ingram.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/84145/wzum- brings-urban-oldies-to-pittsburgh/ Before changing to urban oldies in 2013, WZUM, most of 1550's programming was provided by the Lifestyle TalkRadio Network. WZUM was the \\"Flagship Station\\" of the Woodland Hills Wolverine Football Network. A.W. Gusky Productions produces the broadcasts of Woodland Hills High School football on the station. All of the games are live on WZUM as well as at www.1550wzum.com. Live and archived Woodland Hills High School football broadcasts are available at www.msasports.net. HistoryAs WLOA= This station began as WLOA, with the construction permit first applied for on August 13, 1946. The initial permit was for the station to operate at 910 kHz at a power output of 1,000 watts, daytime only, from a transmitter site to be determined in Swissvale. The permit was amended later than November to move from 910 kHz to its current channel of 1550 kHz, daytime only. In December 1946, the transmitter site located on a hill northeast of Braddock was selected and approved by the FCC. In January 1947, the station applied for permission to increase its daytime power from 1,000 watts daytime non- directional to 5,000 watts and add nighttime power using a directional antenna system. That application was dismissed in February 1947. On May 20, 1947, WLOA signed on the air from its studios at 1233 Braddock Avenue in Braddock, doing business as Matta Broadcasting Company. On June 1, 1959, the station signed on its same-named FM sister, known today as WRRK. The FM provided local radio service after the AM was required to sign off after local sunset. =As WFFM= In 1972, station co-founder William G. Matta, died. Later that year, the station was transferred from his estate to William J. Matta and Mrs. E.R. Matta, with William J. Matta taking full control of the station in 1975. In 1979, the station took the call letters of its sister FM station, by this time known as WFFM, which had adopted them in 1977 and separated itself from its AM sister. The FM station was renamed WFFM-FM and the AM became a full simulcast as WFFM. =Station sale; WCKG= The station was re-assigned the call letters WCKG on May 6, 1981. On May 12, 1982, WCKG and WFFM were sold by Matta Broadcasting Company to Benns Communications. Two years later, Benns sold WCKG to Unity Broadcasting Corporation, thus ending over two decades of common ownership between the AM and FM stations. Unity Broadcasting changed the call letters to WJLY and adopted a religion-based format. =As WCXJ= Unity Broadcasting sold the station, by this time known as WCXJ, in November 1991 to the Homewood-Brushton Revitalization & Development Corporation, which moved the station to 7138 Kelly Street in Pittsburgh. Legendary Pittsburgh urban radio programmer Del King was named the station's general manager. King initiated a diverse format of Urban adult contemporary, talk and religion under this stage of ownership. WCXJ was sold in 1996 to East Coast Communications, Incorporated, which left the format mostly intact. By this time, Del King had left as manager of the station to pursue ownership opportunities, but was retained as chief engineer for WCXJ. =As WURP= WCXJ was sold in May 2000 to Urban Radio of Pennsylvania, a subsidiary of Inner City Broadcasting, which acquired both this station and sister WHAT (AM) in Philadelphia in a $1.5 million transaction. As WURP, the station, at first, featured an Urban AC format (which began in August 2000), and then, in December 2002, it flipped to \\"hot talk\\" with hosts such as The Young Turks, G. Gordon Liddy, Don and Mike, Sporting News Radio, and weekend programming from Air America Radio. WURP also aired the locally produced \\"UnShow with Jeff Schneider\\". =As WFLP= Inner City Broadcasting sold the station to BusinessTalkRadio.net in March 2007, and as WLFP, it aired shows from the Lifestyle TalkRadio Network until its sale in May 2013. AM Guys LLC purchased the station for $14,515 from a SEC receiver appointed to operate it and other assets of the Business Talk Radio Network. AM Guys, headed by Edward DeHart and Stephen Zalenko, had leased the studio and its equipment to Business Talk Radio, and performed sales duties for the company on a contract basis. The purchase was consummated on June 18, 2013. =As WZUM= On June 26, 2013, the station changed its call sign to WZUM (formerly at 1590 AM in Carnegie, Pennsylvania). On July 4, 2013, the station relaunched with an urban oldies format developed by veteran Pittsburgh radio programmer Clarke Ingram.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/84145/wzum-brings-urban-oldies- to-pittsburgh/ Effective March 30, 2016, AM Guys LLC sold WZUM to Pittsburgh Public Media for $75,000.

Komen for the Cure and originally as The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, often referred to as simply Komen, is the largest and best-funded breast cancer organization in the United States. According to the Harris Interactive 2010 EquiTrend annual brand equity poll, Komen was once one of the most trusted nonprofit organizations in America. Komen's 2012 decision to discontinue funding for Planned Parenthood was controversial and brief, attracting widespread media attention and a significant decline in donations and participation at fundraising events. Komen almost immediately reversed its decision and resumed its funding of breast cancer screening and other programs at various Planned Parenthood locations. The organization has also been criticized for executive pay raises, administrative costs, affiliations with certain sponsors and claims that it used misleading statistics in advertising. Between 2011 and 2017 revenue declined by about 80% and a number of affiliates merged or dissolved. In March 2013, Komen's ranking on Charity Navigator dropped from four stars (the highest rating) to three stars, going to two stars in 2014.Susan G. Komen for the Cure, Charity Navigator. Retrieved August 27, 2014. As of June 2016, Komen was back to three stars, with a score of 81 out of 100. History Susan Goodman, later Susan Goodman Komen, was born on October 31, 1943, in Peoria, Illinois. She was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 33. She died of the disease at age 36 on August 4, 1980.\\"Susan G. Komen's story\\", Susan G. Komen for the Cure official site. Retrieved March 2, 2008. Komen's younger sister, Nancy Brinker, believed that Susan's outcome might have been better if patients knew more about cancer and its treatment, and promised Susan that she would do everything she could to end breast cancer. To fulfill that promise, Brinker founded the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation in Komen's memory in 1982. In 2008, the 25th anniversary of the organization, the name was changed to Susan G. Komen for the Cure and trademarked a new logo in support of its promise \\"to end breast cancer forever.\\" The new logo is a pink ribbon that resembles a runner in motion and is meant to reflect the importance of Komen's signature Race for the Cure event, the world's largest fund-raising event for breast cancer education and research. The logo symbolically associates the organization with the values of breast cancer awareness (\\"pink ribbon culture\\"): fear of breast cancer, hope, and the charitable goodness of people and businesses who publicly support the breast cancer movement. In December 2009, Brinker was appointed CEO of the organization. Judith A. Salerno became CEO in 2012. In November 2016, the organization announced that Salerno would step down as CEO the following month. In 2017, former fashion executive and breast cancer survivor Paula Schneider took over as CEO. Philosophy Komen's Mission Statement: Save lives by meeting the most critical needs in our communities and investing in breakthrough research to prevent and cure breast cancer. Komen's Bold Goal: Reduce the current number of breast cancer deaths by 50% in the U.S. by 2026. Komen's philosophy mixes education, action, research, and community involvement. It has funded more than $800 million in breast cancer research. Patient navigation is a main focal point for Komen, especially in recent years. Most recently it was in D.C. to advocate reducing insurance barriers to breast cancer treatment. In line with its Bold Goal, Komen partnered with BreastCancerTrials.org to create a new tool to help people living with metastatic breast cancer find clinical trials. Many scientific reviews have criticized Komen for overpromoting mammography. They concluded that indiscriminate screening mammography for middle-aged and older women, regardless of each woman's risk of developing breast cancer, results in overtreatment of some women whose cancer would never harm them. For every woman whose life is saved by screening mammography, 250 to 500 will be told that they might have breast cancer when they don't (false positives), 125 to 250 will have biopsies performed, and between two and ten will receive unnecessary treatment.BMJ OpEd Says Komen Ads False, By Charles Bankhead, Staff Writer, MedPage Today, August 2, 2012 Other organizations like the National Breast Cancer Coalition follow a \\"medical consumerism\\" model in which physicians educate women about their options and encourage them to make individualized, evidence-based decisions about their health care. Other organizations advocate more research into the environmental causes of breast cancer and cancer prevention.Sulik, 2010. pages 52‚Äì53. ActivitiesUse of funds= In the 2009‚Äì10 fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, Komen reported approximately $400 million in earnings. Of this, $365 million (91.3%) came from contributions from the public, including donations, sponsorships, race entry fees, and contributed goods and services. Approximately $35 million (8.8%) came from interest and dividends and gains on investments. That same fiscal year, Komen reported approximately $360 million in expenses. $283.2 million of this went to program services: $75.4 million (20.9% of total expenditure) went to research, $140.8 million (39.1%) went to public health education, $46.9 million (13%) went to health screening services, and $20.1 million (5.6%) went to treatment services. The other $76.8 million went to supporting services, including $36.1 million (10% of total expenditure) for fund-raising and $40.6 million (11.3%) for general and administrative costs. The Komen CEO's salary in 2010 was $459,406. Komen paid founder and CEO Nancy Brinker $417,712 in 2011. After the Planned Parenthood controversy, donations dropped and the foundation canceled half of its Races for the Cure, but Brinker received a 64% increase to $684,000 annually, which drew flak and was considered \\"extremely high\\" by Charity Navigator's CEO. Komen reported that its CEO earned $565,048 of compensation from the Foundation and related organizations during 2016 on its Internal Revenue Service tax return. It also reported that 14 other employees each earned more than $175,000 of compensation, bonuses, retirement benefits, and other benefits during 2016. =Grants and awards= Since its foundation in 1982, Komen has provided funding for basic, clinical, and translational breast cancer research and for innovative projects in the areas of breast health education and breast cancer screening and treatment. It has awarded more than 1,000 breast cancer research grants totaling more than $180 million. , research grants are available for basic, clinical, and translational research; postdoctoral fellowships; and breast cancer disparities research.\\"Research Grants\\" . Susan G. Komen for the Cure official page. Retrieved February 18, 2007. Komen awards three-year postdoctoral fellowships to people working under experienced cancer researchers to recruit and retain young breast cancer researchers. In addition to funding research, Komen and its affiliates fund non-duplicative, community- based breast health education and breast cancer screening and treatment projects for the medically underserved. Since 1992, Komen has also annually awarded work in the field of cancer research with the Komen Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction. In recent years, Komen has cut by nearly half the proportion of fund-raising dollars it spends on research grants, according to a 2012 Reuters analysis. In 2011, the foundation spent $63 million (15%) of its donations on research grants and awards. =Global activities= Around 458,000 people worldwide die of breast cancer every year. Komen works with local communities and organizations to develop culturally appropriate programs. In 2006, Komen joined the US-Middle East Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research, a Middle East Partnership Initiative program. Komen has programs in Egypt, Israel, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. In 2010, Komen was active in over 50 countries, with its largest affiliates in Italy and Germany. On October 28, 2010, Jerusalem held its first Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure, with over 5,000 Christian, Muslim, and Jewish participants. Before the race, the Old City's walls were illuminated pink by Komen's founder Nancy Brinker, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, and the Prime Minister of Israel's wife Sara Netanyahu. FundraisingCause marketing= Komen raises over $36 million a year from over 60 cause marketing partnerships. These include prominent campaigns, such as those with Yoplait, which runs the Save Lids to Save Lives program, and a partnership with Delta Air Lines. Cause marketing allows Komen to associate the breast cancer brand with its organization. By promoting the \\"fear, hope and goodness\\" associated with the brand, Komen can promote itself, breast cancer awareness, its sponsoring corporations, and conscientious consumption.Sulik, 2010. pages 133-146. =Events= The Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure is the world's largest fundraising event for breast cancer. It consists of a series of 5K runs and fitness walks to raise money for breast cancer, to raise awareness of the disease, to celebrate those who have survived breast cancer, and memorialize those who have not. The first race was run in Dallas, Texas in 1983, with 800 participants.Susan G. Komen for the Cure The race's 25th anniversary was celebrated in 2008. In 2009, it was renamed the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. In 2010, there were about 130 races worldwide. Also in 2016, over 1.6 million people participated in the race, which had over 100,000 volunteers. The race's primary source of revenue is donations collected by the participants. In 2011, Komen said that three-quarters of the event's proceeds were being used locally to pay for community outreach programs, breast health education, and breast cancer screening and treatment projects run by the Komen affiliate, with the remaining quarter sent to the central organization.About Us, Komen's \\"I am the Cure\\" website, accessed June 10, 2011.

(Eggland's Best) * Caterpillar Foundation * Clemens Food Group * Ford Motor Company * General Mills * Hewlett-Packard * Hopkins Manufacturing *FUZE and Honest Tea * L Brands * Mohawk Industries * New Balance * Walgreens * WWE * Yoplait Controversy and criticismPinkwashing= Komen is a key entity in the controversy over \\"pinkwashing\\". The term has been used to describe two different situations: (1) organizations getting disproportionate publicity for donating very little, and (2) organizations that use the pink ribbon to promote products that may be carcinogenic. Ribbon Branded Stadium Donation criticisms Komen benefits from corporate partnerships, receiving over $55 million a year from 216 corporate sponsors. Critics say many of these promotions are deceptive, benefiting the companies more than the charity, and promoting products that may cause cancer. Some campaigns require that consumers mail proof of purchase for a promoted item before the manufacturer donates a few cents per purchase to charity; some have a cap on the maximum amount donated, with all sales beyond this limit benefiting only the company, not the promoted cause. Since its Save Lids to Save Lives campaign began in 1998, Yoplait has donated more than $25 million to Komen. In 2010, its annual maximum commitment was raised to $1.6 million. In return, a major sponsor such as Yoplait obtains an exclusive contract; no other yogurt manufacturer (such as Dreyer's, which inquired in 2000) may use the branding. In 2002, credit card operator American Express launched a \\"Charge for a Cure\\" campaign that claimed that \\"in the search for a cure, every dollar counts.\\" The amount donated per qualifying transaction, regardless of the purchase amount, was one penny. In 2006, Major League Baseball partnered with Komen by selling and donating amounts from pink MLB Louisville Slugger bats, pink baseballs, and necklaces sold. On Mother's Day, breast cancer survivors were eligible to be bat girls in games where pink bats were used. MLB, a $1.2 billion industry, donates around $100,000 a year. Health criticisms Bisphenol A is primarily used to make plastics, such as this polycarbonate water bottle. Several water bottle retailers have partnered with Komen. Water cooler bottles made of polycarbonate may contain BPA, which has been linked to breast cancer tumor growth. For the 2008 model year, Ford Motor Company built a branded limited edition of 2,500 Ford Mustang motorcars with a \\"Warriors in Pink\\" package as part of its long-running association with Komen; an additional 1,000 were offered for 2009's model year. A longitudinal study found that women employed in the automotive plastics industry are almost five times as likely to develop breast cancer before menopause than women in a control group. In April 2010, Komen paired with fast food restaurant chain KFC to offer \\"Buckets for the Cure\\", a promotion in which fried and grilled chicken was sold in pink, branded buckets. The collaboration was criticized by media outlets, including The Colbert Report and Bitch magazine, and raised questions about promoting unhealthy eating habits; KFC chicken is known to contain carcinogenic chemicals. KFC contributed over $4.2 million to Komen, the largest single contribution in the organization's history. The partnership with KFC, which has since ended, allowed Komen \\"to reach many millions of women that they had been unable to reach before\\", said Brinker. In April 2011, Komen introduced a perfume brand, \\"Promise Me\\", promoted by Brinker on the Home Shopping Network, only to encounter opposition due to its potentially harmful ingredients coumarin, oxybenzone, toluene and galaxolide. Komen said it intended to reformulate the perfume but did not withdraw existing stocks of the \\"Promise Me\\" product from distribution. In October 2014, the Houston-based oil field services company Baker Hughes was reported to have produced 1,000 pink drill bits to raise breast cancer awareness. The bits are used to break up geologic formations in oil patches for hydraulic fracturing. These ties have been criticized, because more than a third of the more than 700 chemicals used in fracking are endocrine disruptors and at least a quarter increase the risk of cancer. =Legal battles over trademarking= In 2007, the organization changed its name to Susan G. Komen for the Cure and trademarked the running ribbon as part of its branding strategy. Komen has come under fire for legal action against other organizations using the phrase \\"for the cure\\" in their names. An August 2010 Wall Street Journal article detailed a case in which Komen told the organization Uniting Against Lung Cancer no longer to use the name \\"Kites for the Cure\\" for its annual fund-raising event. Komen also wrote to the organization to warn it \\"against any use of pink in conjunction with 'cure.'\\" More than 100 small charities have received legal opposition from Komen for use of the words \\"for the cure\\" in their names. Among the offending organizations and events were \\"Par for the Cure\\", \\"Surfing for a Cure\\", \\"Cupcakes for a Cure\\" and \\"Mush for the Cure\\". Komen says that the organization protects its trademarks as a matter of financial stewardship to prevent confusion among donors; others suggest that the trademark issue is more about dominating the pink ribbon market.Sulik, 2010, pp. 146‚Äì150. Critics have also asserted that the slogan itself implies the majority of Komen's funds go to research, specifically research to cure (and not merely treat or detect) the disease. But by Komen's own figures, 21% of the total budget goes to research. In the words of cancer survivor Alicia Staley, \\"an organization that is actively pursuing other small charities over the use of the term 'for the cure' does not spend the majority of their own funds towards research for a cure.\\" cited by http://pinkribbonblues.org/2011/01/poor-pink-goliath/ =Relationship with Planned Parenthood= Beginning in 2007, Komen granted money to pay for 170,000 clinical breast exams and 6,400 mammogram referrals at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and affiliates. Komen had said its affiliates provide funds for screening, education and treatment programs in dozens of communities where Planned Parenthood is the only place poor, uninsured or underinsured women can receive these services.An open letter about Susan G. Komen for the Cure and Planned Parenthood August 2010 On January 31, 2012, Komen stopped funding exams provided by Planned Parenthood, citing a congressional investigation by Representative Cliff Stearns and a newly created internal rule about not funding organizations under federal, state or local investigation. While conservative religious and anti-abortion groups applauded the move, it was denounced by several editorials, women's health advocacy groups,Marcotte, Amanda, \\"Susan B. Komen's Act of Cowardice.\\" Slate, January 31, 2012 and politicians.Breaking: Two dozen Senators call on Komen to reverse Planned Parenthood decision (The Washington Post, February 2, 2012) In the 24 hours after the news broke, Planned Parenthood received more than $400,000 from 6,000 donors, followed by pledges of a $250,000 matching grant from New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and a $250,000 gift from a foundation run by the CEO of Bonanza Oil Co. in Dallas to replace the lost funding.Planned Parenthood Replaces Komen Grant With Online Push (Bloomberg Businessweek), February 2, 2012) Four days later, Komen's board of directors reversed the decision and announced that it would amend the policy to \\"make clear that disqualifying investigations must be criminal and conclusive in nature and not political\\". Several top-level staff members resigned from Komen during the controversy.Top official quits, some affiliates upset as Komen cancer fund cuts Planned Parenthood grants (Chicago Tribune, February 1, 2012) In August, Brinker announced she would leave her CEO role.Reuters (August 8, 2012). Susan G. Komen Founder Nancy Brinker To Leave CEO Role. The number of participants at various Komen fundraising events dropped 15‚Äì30% in 2012. The Susan G. Komen 3-Day for the Cure fundraising walks were scaled back to seven US cities in 2013, from 14, due to a 37% drop in participation over the preceding four years. In January 2014 it was reported that the foundation saw a decline of 22% in contributions in the year following their decision to cease (and then continue) funding for Planned Parenthood. Karen Handel, the Brinker prot√©g√©e whose opposition to abortion was at the center of the Planned Parenthood controversy, resigned and has published a book on the controversy titled Planned Bullyhood.Abramovitch, Seth (August 13, 2012). Executive Behind Susan G. Komen's Planned Parenthood Defunding Announces Memoir. The Hollywood Reporter =Embryonic stem cell research= In 2006, Komen wrote in its newsletter that embryonic stem cell research had promise for curing breast cancer. One such grant recipient was Robert A. Weinberg, Ph.D. through Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at MIT. In 2011, the anti-abortion Coalition on Abortion/Breast Cancer said that Komen gave $12 million to institutions such as Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the U.S. National Cancer Institute that funded stem cell research, which the Coalition considered to be abortion.

It was published by Nintendo in Europe and CSG Imagesoft in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game focuses on the wizard Shadax's bid to defeat the evil baron Morbius and rescue Princess Eleanor, whom Morbius plans to sacrifice. Shadax aims to gather the six pieces of the titular Staff of Demnos hidden within the fortress of K√¢stler√∂ck. The game's setting is non-linear, and consists of 250 rooms, each with a particular puzzle to solve. Solstice is the first original game to be developed by Software Creations, which had previously only worked on converted titles between 8-bit consoles. The game features a musical score by Tim Follin, who has named the game's title track as his favourite among his compositions. It became one of his best-known tracks. Solstice was received positively by critics for its puzzles and graphics, and the audio was singled out for praise. A sequel, titled Equinox, was released for the Super NES in 1993. Gameplay An example of gameplay in Solstice. One of the game's many hazards is the large translucent tiles pictured here, which vanish quickly after being jumped on and risk sending the player character Shadax plummeting to the floor of spikes below. Solstice is an isometric-perspective puzzle game in which the player controls the wizard Shadax, who must navigate 250 rooms within the fortress K√¢stler√∂ck and assemble the six pieces of the Staff of Demnos to defeat the baron Morbius and rescue the princess Eleanor.Solstice instruction manual, pp. 11‚Äì18Solstice instruction manual, p. 19 Shadax's basic abilities consist of jumping, and picking up and dropping objects.Solstice instruction manual, p. 6 Early in the game, Shadax can obtain a pair of magic elfin boots that augment his jumping height. He is additionally equipped with a few beakers that can be used to store four different varieties of potions; these potions can either grant temporary invincibility, destroy all moving objects in a room, freeze time, or make invisible objects visible. At the beginning of the game, the beakers can only hold up to two doses of a potion each, though upgrades can be obtained later on. Any number of potions can be cast simultaneously within a given room, but the spell(s) will only last as long as Shadax remains within that room; any effects from the potion(s) will disappear when the room is vacated. Many of the fortress's rooms feature hazards such as floors covered in spikes, conveyor belts, vanishing bridges and tiles, and floating mines, and may also be inhabited by antagonistic creatures such as trolls, giant spiders and demons. The rooms often include movable blocks that can be found either lying on the floor or falling from above. These blocks can be used to move safely around the rooms and bypass enemies and hazards. Falling blocks can be frozen in mid-air with the time-freezing potion and be used as steps. There are also hovering crystal balls that can be pushed through the air and ridden as transportation, but cannot be picked up and carried. In some rooms, bombs can be detonated to create an entrance to a previously blocked-off passageway, though the detonators are hidden within nearby rooms. Other rooms contain portals that provide the only access to certain rooms within the fortress. Some rooms can only be cleared or accessed after finding and using of one of four hidden magic keys. Extra lives can be obtained by collecting blue pointed hats scattered throughout the fortress. Although the screen only registers ten lives at one time, the player can continue to accumulate more lives from that point. The player can also collect coins that allow them to return to a certain room when all lives are lost instead of having to restart the game from the beginning. At any point in the game, the player can access a map that chronicles any room that they have entered and indicates all possible exits; some of these exits appear on the map, but will not appear in-game until a certain task is performed. Aside from the map, the player can view an inventory listing a percentage of the total number of rooms they have visited, as well as the total number of magic items they have found. Plot On the eve of the winter solstice, Morbius the Malevolent kidnaps Eleanor, Princess of Arcadia, to sacrifice her ritually and become the Evil Baron of Darkness. Shadax the wizard, after witnessing the kidnapping, heads to Morbius' stronghold, the fortress K√¢stler√∂ck, to rescue Eleanor. Once while researching K√¢stler√∂ck in the Library of Arcadia to find a way to overthrow Morbius, Shadax learned of a secret entrance into K√¢stler√∂ck and the whereabouts of the Staff of Demnos, an ancient weapon with the power to defeat Morbius. The staff was hidden in K√¢stler√∂ck because that was where Morbius would least expect to find it. Morbius' spies searched for the Staff but did not find it because it was broken into six pieces and made invisible. However, every one hundred years on the winter solstice, all six pieces become visible. Knowing a way in, Shadax enters K√¢stler√∂ck to reassemble the Staff of Demnos, overthrow Morbius' forces of darkness, and save Princess Eleanor.Solstice instruction manual, pp. 7‚Äì10 Upon restoring the Staff of Demnos, Shadax seeks out and frees Eleanor from imprisonment and destroys Morbius with the Staff. Development and releaseConception and design= The development of Solstice was initiated by the programmer Mike Webb of Software Creations,Solstice instruction manual, p. 20 who desired to create a Knight Lore-style isometric title for the NES. Solstice is the first original game to be developed within the company, which had previously only developed converted titles between 8-bit consoles. Mark Wilson, having previously worked as a programmer and a graphics artist for the company, saw Webb's proposal as an opportunity to attempt the role of a video game designer. In spite of his personal dislike of isometric games up to that point, Wilson thought it sensible to create an isometric title as the company's first original work, as no such format had previously been attempted on the NES. Over the course of four weeks, Wilson designed the entire game as sketches and notes on paper, often within a McDonald's on Oxford Road. All the game's item positions and events were placed on a \\"master map\\" hand-drawn on a very large sheet of graph paper, and were based on Wilson's understanding of what the player might think or need at any particular point. This detailed approach put Wilson at odds with Webb, who failed to see why such an amount of time would be taken to design a game as opposed to expediently inserting rooms into a map at random. At one point, Webb presented Wilson with an alternate map created by his girlfriend the previous night, which consisted of 255 randomly-connected empty rooms. Out of guilt for their furious arguments and pleasure with the final product, Wilson would ultimately give Webb a co-designer credit in the game's attract mode screens. Wilson would later regret this action; during a subsequent interview with Wilson at MicroProse, one of the interviewers falsely identified Webb as the game's sole designer. =Visuals and audio= During the game's early stages of development, the player character Shadax appeared as a nondescript purple rectangle; the Shadax sprite was eventually designed by Wilson.CSG Imagesoft Inc. (1990). The Making of Solstice In creating the game's setting and aesthetic, Wilson acknowledged the slim capacity for storytelling on Nintendo's cheapest available cartridge, and thus focused on the game's atmosphere, which he says \\"traded on the simplest and most basic of fantasy ideas\\". On stylistic influences, Wilson stated that \\"All of the usual suspects at that time probably should be included as sources, from Lord of the Rings to Excalibur.\\" A sample of the opening theme of Solstice, composed by Tim Follin. The game's music was composed by Tim Follin. The primary background music was made to be atmospheric and dark, while the opening theme was made to be powerful. On his approach to the score, Follin commented that the \\"folk\\" melody style he had previously used for Ghouls 'n Ghosts was particularly suited for Solstice due to the game's fantasy-oriented title and setting. The title theme's changing moods and phases were an attempt by Follin to keep the track interesting; Follin felt that the constant evolution required to keep music in general interesting was imperative in video game music due to its lack of vocals and performance at the time. During development, a colleague of Follin played for him several works of game composer Rob Hubbard, which convinced Follin that the technical boundaries of the contemporary generation of hardware have been reached, and refocused his attention from the score's technique to the composition. While Follin retrospectively identified the title theme to be his favourite among his own compositions, he felt that his work on the in-game music could have been improved to be \\"a lot more spacious and interesting\\", as it \\"looped too short and became irritating quite quickly\\". =Publishing and release= The game's development spanned the course of 20 months. While Solstice was given an early demonstration to Nintendo, Software Creations owner Richard Kay grew impatient and quickly sold the game's North American publishing rights to CSG Imagesoft. After a response from Nintendo stating their desire to publish the title, Nintendo was given the publishing rights for all other regions, and the resulting contract with Nintendo would lead to other high-profile NES and SNES games. Upon receiving the game's publishing rights, CSG demanded that Shadax be changed from a wizard to a bodybuilder in a loincloth. When Wilson refused to make the change, CSG then made the request that Shadax's beard in the cutscenes be shortened, and the alteration was made against Wilson's protest. The package art, designed by Carol Roy, was lambasted by Wilson as having nothing to do with the game that was written, and he deemed it inferior to a proposed cover created by Neal Sutton that had already been supplied to CSG. He also derided the instruction booklet written by CSG as \\"a mass of illiterate and asinine drivel\\". Wilson spent the game's development time attempting to obtain a contract from Software Creations covering his work on Solstice, only to be given verbal promises about the percentage of the profits he would receive. Following the game's completion, these promises were casually broken, and Wilson would not receive any monetary gain from the title's sales. Wilson left Software Creations following this development, and struggled to obtain work for the next two years. Solstice was announced in April 1990, and was released in July 1990 in North America and Europe. CSG's advertisement campaign for Solstice in North America consisted of a photograph of what Wilson described as \\"an oiled-up bodybuilder with long hair wearing dayglo pink posing trunks\\", which he called \\"embarrassingly bad\\". The first 5,000 customers to order Solstice from CSG Imagesoft received a free \\"Player's Pak\\", consisting of an 8 mm video tape on the making of Solstice, a player's score card, trading cards and colored stickers. Solstice was featured in the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, with the first press coverage of the game in March 1990 by The Dallas Morning News as part of the Championships. Reception Solstice was met with a positive critical reception upon release. Richard Leadbetter of Computer and Video Games described the gameplay as \\"excellent, with some brain-bending puzzles and nice power-ups for Shadax's abilities\\". Paul Glancey, also of Computer and Video Games, described Solstice as \\"a BIG game with an awful lot of secrets to discover\\", and compared the game's puzzles to those of Knight Lore. Julian Rignall of Mean Machines also made a positive comparison to Knight Lore and noted that some of the puzzles were \\"very devious\\". However, Matt Regan, also of Mean Machines, stated that while Solstice is a challenging game that \\"puzzle fans should find interesting\\", \\"the excitement fades\\" as \\"shifting blocks to stand on or to prevent the attacks of a nasty becomes boring\\". While Marc Camron and Ed Semrad of Electronic Gaming Monthly respectively considered the game to be \\"unique\\" and \\"a refreshing change of pace from all of the me-too type puzzle games\\", the publication's four reviewers collectively found the controls difficult and awkward. Robin Wyles of Raze compared the game's visuals and gameplay to those of Cadaver, and saw Solstice as \\"an admirable attempt to relive the Knight Lore days\\" that was \\"quite refreshing\\" in the face of the NES's lack of isometric-perspective titles. However, he argued that the game's quantity of puzzles negatively impacted their variety, and felt that the puzzles were \\"a bit too easy to solve, which reduces its long-term appeal\\". Leadbetter described the graphics as \\"excellent throughout, with some of the best backdrops and sprites ever seen in this type of game\\", and Glancey also felt the game's graphics were \\"really lovely\\". Rignall, Regan and Semrad described the graphics as \\"great\\", and Steve Harris and Ken \\"Sushi-X\\" Williams of EGM said the game was \\"beautiful\\". While Wyles appreciated the game's isometric perspective, he saw the colour schemes as \\"unimaginative\\". The game's score was singled out for praise. Leadbetter proclaimed that \\"the renowned Tim Follin comes up trumps yet again with some brilliant atmospheric scores\\", and both he and Glancey, along with Rignall, considered the soundtrack to be some of the best they had heard on the NES. Regan described the game's soundtrack as \\"moody and atmospheric\\", and Semrad called the music \\"fantastic\\". Wyles, however, described the sound effects as \\"ropey\\" and the in-game background music as \\"mediocre\\". The title theme in particular became one of Follin's best-known tracks in retrospect. Brett Elston of GamesRadar+ proclaimed that \\"if any 8-bit song could take you on a journey, this is it. From its modest, almost hobbit-like opening to its soaring jig halfway through, the title screen music tramples over all other NES music.\\" He additionally described the game's primary background track as \\"considerably more mellow but no less proficient and listenable\\", and preferred its presence as in-game music \\"because there's no way I could play ANYTHING with that title screen going nuts\\". Nate Andrews of Nintendo World Report said that \\"the regality of the opening track provides a fantastic build up for the ensuing blast, which nearly forces you to take a knee under its spectacle before dropping into extended, kicking jig, then moving into the rest of the prog-y soundtrack\\". Layton Shumway of VentureBeat remarked that the theme \\"sounds like a lost track from a Yes album\\" and that it \\"psyches you out with its single-note fanfare intro, instantly kicks into high gear with cascading synth lines, then settles into a propulsive 6/8 rock beat\\". Sequel A sequel to Solstice, titled Equinox, was announced on January 1992, initially for a summer release that year, and was released for the Super NES on November 1993. The game's plot centers on Shadax's son Glendaal, who must rescue Shadax from his treacherous apprentice Sonia.Equinox instruction booklet, pp. 4‚Äì5 The game consists of 450 rooms split between eight dungeons, and also features an isometric perspective, but includes a rotatable camera that incorporates Mode 7 effects. Tim Follin reprised his role as composer and was joined in this duty by his brother Geoff. Equinox was released to generally positive critical reception.

He was a Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 2005 to 2007, representing the southwest Sydney electorate of Macquarie Fields. Chaytor was educated at St Gregory's College in Campbelltown and the University of Technology, Sydney, where he completed degrees in international studies and law. He worked as a solicitor and advisor to former Prime Minister of Australia Gough Whitlam, and first entered local politics in 1999, when he was elected to the Campbelltown City Council. Chaytor was widely expected as a favourite to enter federal politics when Mark Latham resigned as the member for the safe seat of Werriwa in 2005. However, after a messy pre-selection battle with Campbelltown Mayor Brenton Banfield over who would run in the resulting by-election, Chaytor lost out to compromise candidate Chris Hayes. There was little challenge possible, however, when Chaytor was nominated several months later to replace Craig Knowles in a by-election for his safe state seat of Macquarie Fields. Though he was challenged by whistleblower nurse Nola Fraser, Chaytor survived a strong swing to the Liberal Party to win the seat. Assault conviction On 20 December 2006, Chaytor was charged with assault over an alleged incident which occurred on 10 December. Chaytor claimed in his defence that he was attempting to prevent his partner from self-harm. The Premier, Morris Iemma, sought to suspend Chaytor's membership of the Labor Party. The case was heard on 15 January 2007 at Campbelltown Local Court, and Chaytor was found guilty four days later. NSW Premier Morris Iemma announced shortly after that he was to be expelled from the Labor Party and a new candidate found for the coming March state election. That new candidate was Dr Andrew McDonald, a local paediatrician. Despite the fact that the assault conviction dealt with a personal matter involving Chaytor and that he had been disendorsed by the Labor Party, the Sunday Telegraph cited the conviction as among the reasons why the Iemma Government should be defeated at the March 2007 election. On 30 July 2007, the conviction was quashed on appeal by the District Court, citing insufficient evidence. The appeal judge found that Chaytor had acted in self-defence and was trying to stop his former partner from committing suicide. The NSW branch of the ALP ultimately decided to reinstate Mr Chaytor's ALP membership in light of the legal decision. Chaytor did not nominate as a candidate for re-election in the 2008 local government elections for Campbelltown City Council.

Debulking is used with curative intent in only some types of cancer, as generally partial removal of a malignant tumor is not a worthwhile intervention for curative purposes (because malignant cells left behind soon multiply and renew the threat). Ovarian cancer and some types of brain tumor are debulked before radiotherapy or chemotherapy begin, making those therapies more effective. It may also be used in the case of slow-growing tumors to shift tumor cells from phase of cell cycle to replicative pool. In other types of cancer where debulking is not curative, it is sometimes done with palliative intent to relieve mass effect. For example, tumors whose bulk presses on the lungs or esophagus can impair breathing or swallowing, in which case debulking can improve quality of life and extend survival regardless of not curing the cancer.

It is the seat of the Municipality of Komen. It is located on the Karst Plateau in the Slovenian Littoral.Komen municipal site Name Komen was attested in written sources in 1247 as Cominum (and as Cumin in 1255, de Cumino in 1269, and Comein in 1526). The name is probably derived from the Slavic common noun *kom—ä 'hill, mountain, elevation'. Derivation from the noun komin 'stove, chimney' is unlikely for accentual reasons. The Italian name, which is derived from the Slovene name, is given as Comen in older sources and Comeno in newer sources. History In the Middle Ages, it was first part of the Duchy of Friuli and in the 13th century it was included in the County of Gorizia. Komen was first mentioned in a document from 1247. In 1500, the whole region fell under Habsburg dominion and it was included in the County of Gorizia and Gradisca until 1918. During World War I, the western parts of the municipality were devastated by the Battles of the Isonzo. After the end of the war in November 1918, the area was occupied by Italian troops and annexed to Italy with the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920. On February 15, 1944, the village of Komen was burned down by the Nazi German troops as retaliation for Partisan resistance activity in the area; the surviving inhabitants were forcibly resettled to Bavaria, from where they only returned after the end of World War II. In 1947, it became part of Yugoslavia and in 1991 of independent Slovenia.

Early life, education and army experience Born June 17, 1925, in Brooklyn, New York, Fox attended James Madison High School, in the Midwood/Madison section of Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in a traditional Jewish family. Fox is a World War II veteran and, as a POW of the Germans, witnessed the heroism of Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds who saved Fox' life by saying, \\"We're all Jews\\" when the Nazi officers demanded that all Jewish POWs be pointed out. CareerEarly years: 1954-1955= Fox's first experience in children's programming came in 1954, with a St. Louis program, The Finder on KETC-TV, a children's news and travelogue program. His first national exposure came when CBS brought him aboard in 1955. For three years he co-hosted the children's travelogue, Let's Take a Trip...\\"Taking two children on sort of an electronic field trip every week--live, remote location, no audience, no sponsors,\\" Fox himself described that show, during interviews for PBS's The American Experience. =The $64,000 Challenge= In 1956, Fox became the first host of the game show The $64,000 Challenge, a spinoff of the The $64,000 Question. In his first appearance he was identified as \\"Bill Fox,\\" but by the second program he became \\"Sonny Fox\\" because, he claimed, the name \\"Bill Fox\\" had been registered by another entertainment personality; in the same interview Fox stated his difficulties as a game show host included his \\"predilection for asking the answers.\\" Fox was replaced a few weeks into the series by Ralph Story. Fox's brief tenure on the show may have enabled him to escape tainting from the 1950s quiz show scandals, and during an interview on American Experience he reported being horrified by related testimony to Congress‚Äîincluding that of child star Patty Duke, who had participated on The $64,000 Challenge and who later admitted that she had been coached to lie to Congressional investigators. Fox's later involvement in game show hosting was limited to occasional substitutions for Bill Cullen (the original host of The Price Is Right) and Bud Collyer (host of Beat the Clock and To Tell the Truth). =Wonderama= In 1959 the independent television network Metromedia (born from the former DuMont Network) hired Fox to host Wonderama on its New York flagship station, WABD (later becoming WNEW- TV), succeeding the team of Bill Britten and Doris Faye. Fox became Wonderama's sole host until 1967. Fox's version of the program was a mixture of slapstick and serious content, with the marathon Wonderama (during Fox's tenure the show ran four hours Sunday mornings) including Shakespearean dramatizations, guest celebrities, magic demonstrations (customarily by magician James \\"The Amazing\\" Randi), art instruction, spelling bees, learning games, or other elements. =Just for Fun= In 1959 Fox created and hosted the Saturday morning children's television show Just For Fun! which, like Wonderama, aired on WNEW-TV in New York. Based upon the \\"color war\\" team competitions common at children's summer camp, participants engaged in a wide range of contests. Guests on the program included Yogi Berra, Tim Conway, Huntz Hall, Charlotte Rae, and Soupy Sales. Fox left the program in 1965. =On Your Mark= In 1960, Fox hosted ABC's first original Saturday morning show, On Your Mark, a game show in which children answered questions about various professions. Because Fox was under \\"exclusive\\" contract to WNEW-TV, On Your Mark aired on Channel 5 in New York, instead of ABC's station WABC-TV. On Your Mark lasted one season. =Other media activities= In 1966 Fox appeared in the film The Christmas That Almost Wasn't. In 1967 Fox co-hosted a daily talk/variety show for adults titled The New Yorkers on WNEW-TV, with co-hosts Penelope Wilson and Gloria Okon, plus newsman Stewart Klein. In 1976 Fox hosted the California-based Way Out Games, and during 1977 he ran children's programming for NBC. During the 1970s Fox served as a lecturer at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Philanthropy In the 1970s , Fox joined and later became the chairman of the board for Population Communications Internationalhttp://www.population.org/ (PCI), a New York-based nonprofit dedicated to improving family planning issues through popular media. PCI's work included working with U.S. and international soap opera producers, helping them develop \\"more healthful\\" family planning story lines. Memoirs In September 2012, Fox published his memoirs, titled But You Made the Front Page! Wonderama, Wars and a Whole Bunch of Life.

Her time as a Warner Bros. contract player during the 1930s was particularly productive. She was noted for her supporting work in successful films of the 1930s and 1940s such as Jezebel (1938) and Scarlet Street (1945) and her leading roles in lower-budgeted B movie films such as the Ellery Queen series at Columbia in the early 1940s. Critics regard her portrayal of Nathaniel Hawthorne's Hepzibah Pyncheon in the 1940 film adaptation of The House of the Seven Gables as Lindsay's standout career role. Early life Born in Dubuque, Iowa, Lindsay was the eldest of six children of a pharmacist father who died in 1930. According to Tom Longden of the Des Moines Register, \\"Peg\\" was \\"a tomboy who liked to climb pear trees\\" and was a \\"roller-skating fiend.\\" She graduated in 1930 from Visitation Academy in Dubuque. Career1930s= After attending National Park Seminary in Washington, D.C., Lindsay convinced her parents to enroll her at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. She went abroad to England to make her stage debut. She appeared in plays such as Escape, Death Takes a Holiday, and The Romantic Age. She was often mistaken as being British due to her convincing English accent. Her fellow dramatic-school student Robert Cummings was then posing as the Englishman \\"Blade Stanhope Conway\\" and convinced Margaret Kies to follow his example and adopt a new British identity: Margaret Lindsay. She impressed Universal Studios enough to sign her for their 1932 version of The Old Dark House. As James Robert Parish and William T. Leonard wrote in Hollywood Players: The Thirties (Arlington House, 1976), Lindsay returned to America and arrived in Hollywood, only to discover that Gloria Stuart had been cast in her role in the film. After some minor roles in Pre- Code films such as Christopher Strong and the groundbreaking Baby Face, which starred Barbara Stanwyck, Lindsay was cast in the Fox Film Corporation's award-winning Cavalcade. Lindsay was selected for a small but memorable role as Edith Harris, a doomed English bride whose honeymoon voyage takes place on the Titanic. She won the role by backing up her British accent with an elaborate \\"biography\\" that claimed she was born in a London suburb, the daughter of a London broker who sent her to a London convent for her education. \\"Although I looked and talked English... to tell them I was actually from Iowa would have lost the assignment for me,\\" she later explained. Her work in Cavalcade earned her a contract at Warner Bros. where she became a reliable supporting player, working with Paul Muni, Errol Flynn, Henry Fonda, Warren William, Leslie Howard, George Arliss, Humphrey Bogart, Boris Karloff and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Lindsay was cast four times as the love interest of James Cagney in Warner films from 1933 to 1935: Frisco Kid, Devil Dogs of the Air, G Men and Lady Killer. Lindsay and Glenda Farrell in The Law in Her Hands (1936) Lindsay co-starred with Bette Davis in four Warners films: as Davis's sister in Fog Over Frisco (1934); in Dangerous (1935), for which Davis won her first Best Actress Academy Award; in Bordertown, co-starring Paul Muni, and, lastly, as Davis's rival for Henry Fonda's affections in Jezebel (1938), which earned Davis her second Best Actress Academy Award. An example of her work in a leading role in lower budget films while at Warner Bros. was The Law in Her Hands (1936), a comedy in which she played a mob lawyer. As film historian John McCarty wrote, it was \\"that rarity among gangster films to offer a female in the male-dominated mouthpiece role.\\" Author Roger Dooley identified the movie as \\"being the only film of the 1930s to concern itself with a pair of female legal partners\\". Made after the Motion Picture Production Code came into effect, however, The Law in Her Hands was forced into adopting \\"a reactionary stance towards the gender switch\\", and concluded with a plot twist that was the complete opposite of the Pre-Code period (1929‚Äì1934), when \\"female characters on the screen could say, do, and be whatever they wanted.\\" =1940s= Perhaps Lindsay's most acclaimed film role was in The House of the Seven Gables in 1940, with George Sanders and Vincent Price.The House of the Seven Gables film details, imdb.com; accessed May 4, 2016. Directed by Joe May from a screenplay by Lester Cole, the film's musical score by Frank Skinner was nominated for an Academy Award. Price recalled that \\"Margaret Lindsay was a delight to work with and a very good actress.\\" Michael Brunas, John Brunas and Tom Weaver wrote in Universal Horrors: The Studio's Classic Films, 1931‚Äì46 that Lindsay \\"...one of the loveliest and most talented of '30s leading ladies, contributes a fine, mature performance that's probably the best, certainly the most striking, in the picture... [h]ad a Bette Davis played Hepzibah, this same performance would be hailed as a classic...\\"Universal Horrors: Studio's Classic Films, 1931-46 (January 31, 1991), McFarland & Co Inc. In a 2004 Classic Images article about actor Jon Hall, film historian Colin Briggs wrote that a letter he had received from Lindsay indicated that her part in The House of the Seven Gables was her \\"favorite role.\\" Lindsay's letter to Briggs also stated that the film she had the most fun with was The Vigilantes Return (1947), in which she co-starred with Jon Hall. \\"...[That] role was a complete departure from my usual parts and I grabbed it... I even warbled a Mae West type ditty. As a man-chasing saloon singer after Jon Hall it was for me a totally extroverted style and I relished the opportunity... I have a framed still from that film on a wall in my home.\\" Lindsay with Boris Karloff in British Intelligence (1940). Her 1940s film series work in Hollywood included Columbia's first entry in its Crime Doctor series, as well as her continuing role as Nikki Porter in Columbia's Ellery Queen series (1940‚Äì1942). Author Jon Tuska's affection for the Ellery Queen series mystified its star Ralph Bellamy. During an interview by Tuska for his 1978 book, The Detective in Hollywood, he remarked, \\"I'm one of the few who does [like the series].\\" \\"I don't know how ... They were such quickie pictures\\", Bellamy replied. Jon Tuska cited Ellery Queen, Master Detective (1940) and Ellery Queen's Penthouse Mystery (1941) as the best of the Bellamy-Lindsay pairings. \\"The influence of The Thin Man series was apparent in reverse,\\" Tuska noted about Ellery Queen's Penthouse Mystery. \\"Ellery and Nikki are unmarried but obviously in love with each other. Probably the biggest mystery ... is how Ellery ever gets a book written. Not only is Nikki attractive and perfectly willing to show off her figure ... but she also likes to write her own stories on Queen's time, and gets carried away doing her own investigations\\", Tuska opined. Lindsay appeared in a supporting role in the 1942 film The Spoilers, starring John Wayne, and in Fritz Lang's Scarlet Street in 1945. While her work in the late 1940s would occasionally involve a supporting role in MGM films like Cass Timberlane with Spencer Tracy, her film career went into decline, with roles in films at Poverty Row studios like Monogram Pictures and PRC. She returned to the stage and co-starred with Franchot Tone in The Second Man. =1950s and 1960s= She made her television debut in 1950 in The Importance of Being Earnest, which allowed her to once again display her finely-honed British accent. More television work followed. Lindsay appeared in only four films during the 1950s and two in the 1960s. Her final feature film was Tammy and the Doctor (1963). Personal life  Early in her career, Lindsay lived with her sister Helen in Hollywood. Later in life, she lived with her youngest sister, Mickie. She never married. According to biographer and historian William J. Mann, Lindsay was the life partner of musical theatre, film and television actress Mary McCarty (1923‚Äì1980), who predeceased Lindsay. Death Lindsay died at the age of 70 of emphysema in 1981 at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. She was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California.Celebrities in Los Angeles Cemeteries Family Lindsay's sister, Jane Kies (1909‚Äì1985), was also an actress under the stage name Jane Gilbert. Lindsay's niece, Peggy Kenline, and great-nephew, Brad Yates, were also actors.

It was launched in 1995, in the same year as the network it airs on. A nightly half-hour show, Golf Central features news and highlights from the major golf tours and events of the world, in addition to on-site reports from tournaments. Format The show's format involving anchors varies -- sometimes there is just one anchor on the desk for a show; sometimes an anchor is joined by an analyst for tournament recaps; or two anchors will be used. With the recent additions of new talent for the show, the latter format has been utilized more recently. There is never one mainstay anchor team, as anchor teams vary from night to night. From Thursdays through Sundays during tournament play, from 9 AM Eastern to 4 PM, one single anchor will give half-hourly updates on current tournament leaderboards. While tournaments are in progress, editions of Golf Central air every half hour to provide updates on the current event, including highlights and leaderboards. During notable golf events (such as the Men's major tournaments and the Ryder Cup, among others), Golf Channel also airs special Live From editions of Golf Central before and after their respective broadcastswhich provides special extended coverage on-location from tournament sites; including analysis and coverage of press conferences.

Classification Along with the Deshastha and Konkanastha Brahmins, the Karhade Brahmins are referred to as Maharashtrian Brahmins. =Based on Veda and Vedanta= Karhade Brahmins are essentially Rigvedi Brahmins who follow the Ashwalayana Sutra.. Karhade Brahmins are divided into two groups based on the Vedanta they follow, the first of which follows the Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara and the second of which follow the Dvaita Vedanta of Madhvacharya. Majority of Karhade Brahmins are Smarthas, while small minority among them are Madhwas. Like their Deshastha counterparts, traditionally the karhade allowed cross-cousin marriages.Karve, I., 1958. What is caste. Economic Weekly, 10(4), p.153. ;Sub-division and other claims There are three divisions of Karhade Brahmins - Karhade (from Desh), Padye and Bhatt Prabhu (from Konkan). \\"Padhye\\" was a further division of \\"Padye\\" - and were Khots or farmers. According to author Sandhya Gokhale, The Karhade Brahmins of Desh always looked down upon the Padyes and always considered them to be of inferior status. According to author Pran Nath Chopra, The Karhade Brahmins who were appointed as the priests came to be called as \\"Upadhyayas\\" which in due course became Padhye. Origin The Karhade Brahmins take their name from the town of Karad in Satara district, the sacred junction of the Koina and Krishna. They migrated to the region between Malvan and Sangameshwar near the Konkan coast and made it their home land.The Karhade section, though it takes its name from Karad, a place in the Deccan region, is found chiefly in the Konkan coast. Karhade Brahmins are generally thought to be a branch of the Deshastha Rigvedi's who immigrated from their home in Satara district to the southern part of Ratnagiri on the Konkan Coast, where they were principally settled.  Demographics  Most Karhade Brahmins live in Maharashtra though a significant population exist in Goa, Karnataka, and cities outside Maharashtra such as Sagar and Indore in present day state of Madhya Pradesh.Ancestors of these people moved to these places during 18th century during the Maratha empire period.A southern branch of the Karhade Brahmins settled around the Kasargod region of the Malabar coast and they are called the \\"Karada Brahmins\\" and share their traditions with Kerala Brahmins and the Brahmins of South Karnataka.  Culture Occupation= Traditionally, the Karhade Brahmins were a community of priests who offered religious services in Hindu temple and to other communities. =Language= Marathi is the mother tongue of most of the Karhade Brahmins in Maharashtra. =Diet= Karhade Brahmins generally follow a vegetarian diet.

It is not directly affiliated with the Blue Ridge Rifles that existed as a military unit of the Confederate States Army during the Civil War. The ROTC unit was named in honor of the Confederate Army unit. Today, the Blue Ridge Rifles perform year-round for the University of North Georgia events, high schools, parades, sporting events, as well as 21 gun salutes and flag folding for military and police funerals. HistoryCivil War= In June 1861, the city of Dahlonega, Georgia sent their second group of 89 volunteers, the Blue Ridge Rifles to the Civil War front under the command of Capt. Joseph E. Hamilton. The ages of the members in the BRR ranged from 13 to 47 years, and the average age of men in the unit was 23 years. The unit was organized as Company E, Phillip‚Äôs Legion Infantry. In 1864, the time for which the Rifles' enlistment expired, they did not disband but re-enlisted for the remainder of the war. Following the war, all units of the Confederacy were disbanded. The members of the Blue Ridge Rifles continued to meet on a social basis. The men of the Blue Ridge Rifles were known for their \\"lofty\\" character. University of North Georgia drill team In 1950, a drill platoon was formed for use in Spring parades at the University of North Georgia. The team was named the Honor Platoon. The name was later changed to the Drill Platoon. In 1965, the Drill Platoon was renamed the Blue Ridge Rifles in honor of the Dahlonega volunteer unit. Since its early beginnings, the Blue Ridge Rifles Drill Team has earned state and national recognition. In 1967 the unit placed second in the Vanderbilt Invitational Drill Competition. Their earliest first place victory came in 1971 at the East Tennessee State University Drill Meet in Tennessee, and have since won First Place honors at the nationally recognized Mardi Gras Invitational Drill Meet in New Orleans, Louisiana, hosted by Tulane University. The Blue Ridge Rifles won their first National Championship for precision drill teams at Eastern Kentucky University (EKU) in 1982, while commanded by cadet CPT Harden Hopper. The Drill Master was cadet MSG Lewis Lockett. The faculty advisor was MAJ Charles Clarkson. EKU was an invitational drill meet that included the Pershing Rifle national championship as a sub- element. The Blue Ridge Rifles took first place overall, beating all teams competing, to include the Pershing Rifle champion team from St. Peters College, commanded by cadet CPT George Santana. Also in 1982, the Blue Ridge Rifles took first place at the Mardi Gras invitational drill meet at Tulane and first place at the Georgia Tech invitational. Overall they have won 16 out of 24 Mardi Gras Appearances since then. In 1983 the Blue Ridge Rifles, commanded by C/CPT D.Lee Hackle, with Executive Officer C1/lt Jerry Purvis and Drill Master C/MSG Ken Marshall again won the national title at Bowling Green University in Ohio.

History By the late 1950s, Van Peebles had been involved in filmmaking and had made two short films. He was unable to establish himself as a film director in Hollywood because the concept of a black director was unheard of in America at that time. Consequently, he went to France, learned the language, and wrote La Permission in French. Learning he could adapt one of his novels into film with a $60,000 grant from the French Cinema Center, so long as his film was \\"artistically valuable, but not necessarily commercially viable,\\" he sought a film producer. Once partnered with the Office de Production d'Edition et de Realisation (OPERA), a collective consisting of Michel Zemer, Guy Pefond and Christian Shivat, he shot La Permission in 36 days for a cost of $200,000, finally releasing the picture under the title The Story of a Three-Day Pass (1968).

Van Peebles also collaborated on the score with Mickey Baker and sings one of the two songs written for the film, \\"When My Number Gonna Hit\\". The other song, \\"Hard Times\\", is a man-woman duet; one of the singers is Mickey Baker. In 2020, the film was one of the selections of the Cannes Classics section at the Cannes Film Festival. Synopsis The film tells the story of Turner (Harry Baird), a Black U.S. army man stationed in France whose captain gives him a three-day pass just after he promotes him. As Turner gets ready to leave, his reflection in the mirror accuses him of being an Uncle Tom, but this is not the only time his reflection criticizes him or makes him doubt himself. Turner goes to Paris, where he wanders mostly aimlessly for the first day. He finds himself in a nightclub, where he meets a white French shop clerk named Miriam (Nicole Berger). The pair spends the rest of the weekend together, enjoying their romance but also struggling with the complexities of racism. Eventually their miscegenation is reported to Turner's captain (Hal Brav) and Turner is restricted to barracks, where he decides that such amorous adventures are futile.

Professional wrestling careerIndependent circuit (1997‚Äìpresent)= LuFisto began training when she was 17 years old in her hometown of Sorel-Tracy, Quebec. On June 23, 1997, she made her debut in St-Leonard-d'Aston, Quebec, under the ring name Lucifer. She then moved to Montreal where she joined RWR and Northern Championship Wrestling (NCW). Her first trip to the States was in 1998, wrestling for Eastern Township Wrestling Alliance, where she modified her name to Lucy Fer. In late 1998, she joined the Eastern Wrestling Alliance under the name Luscious Lucy as \\"Centerfold\\" Steve Ramsey's valet. She also began appearing at Green Mountain Wrestling shows in Vermont at this point. By mid-1999, working for International Wrestling 2000 in Quebec, The Mountie Jacques Rougeau changed her name to Precious Lucy. At EWA, she was teaming with Mark \\"Jaguar\\" Nugera and manager Joshua Shea to form Partners in Crime in many mixed gender tag-team and singles bouts. Precious Lucy also became the first female in Quebec to win a male championship at ICW, defeating Serge Proulx for the ICW Provincial Championship. This is also where she developed her hardcore style. In 2002, under the ring name LuFisto, she was booked to appear in the main event of Blood, Sweat N' Ears in a match featuring hardcore wrestler Bloody Bill Skullion. The Ontario Athletics Commission, citing a regulation that prevented women and men from wrestling each other, threatened to withdraw the license for the show. This essentially banned LuFisto from wrestling in Ontario. She lodged a complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Commission. On February 26, 2006, the OHRC informed LuFisto that they had convinced the OAC to drop the regulation. The OAC subsequently dropped the vast majority of the regulations affecting professional wrestling in Ontario, a move which removed a great deal of the bureaucracy stifling independent wrestling in the province. LuFisto then worked primarily for National Wrestling Alliance's NWA Quebec Pro Wrestling promotion, where she is head trainer (along with Dru Onyx) of their wrestling school, Onyx and LuFisto's Torture Chamber. LuFisto in 2009 LuFisto also worked for Combat Zone Wrestling, where, on August 12, 2006 in Philadelphia, she became the first ever female CZW Iron Man Champion, pinning Kevin Steen to win the title. On October 29, 2006, she won the Stranglehold Wrestling Death Match Tournament, the first deathmatch tournament in Canada. In the first round, she defeated the Juggulator; in the second round, she defeated Skullion in a lighttube match, and she defeated Necro Butcher in the finals to win the tournament. On December 9, after a tag match at the CZW Cage of Death event, she became the first female ever to wrestle inside of the Cage of Death match when she added herself in the last minute in a match that also involved Zandig, Nick Gage, and Lobo. Gage would go on to win the match by pinning Zandig. On January 8, 2007, however, she announced on her web site a possible retirement due to a back problem and that she would be forfeiting the CZW Iron Man Championship.LuFisto's Official Website! She made her first appearance in a wrestling ring since her injury on April 13, 2007, for Association de Lutte F√©minine (ALF) in Montreal, as the special referee in a match for the ALF Championship between champion Stefany Sinclair and Kacey Diamond. On September 22, 2007, LuFisto made her return to IWS at Blood, Sweat and Beers in which she lost a match to Damian. On October 27, 2007, LuFisto entered IWA Mid-South's 2007 Queen of the Deathmatch Tournament, where she defeated Mickie Knuckles to win the title of Queen of fhe Deathmatch. She has since returned to Combat Zone Wrestling. On September 12, 2008, she won the vacant ALF Championship by defeating Kacey Diamond. =Shimmer Women Athletes (2006‚Äìpresent)= LuFisto debuted in Shimmer Women Athletes on October 24, 2006 in Berwyn, Illinois. She lost her first match to Mercedes Martinez, but came back and won her second match against Allison Danger. On July 5, 2008, she returned to Shimmer at the tapings of Volumes 19 and 20, defeating Rain on Volume 19 and losing to Cheerleader Melissa in a match that earned a standing ovation from the audience on Volume 20. On October 19, 2008, she teamed with Jennifer Blake as the Suicide Blondes to take part in the Shimmer Tag Team Championship Gauntlet Match. They were able to eliminate the Canadian NINJAs of Portia Perez and Nicole Matthews but came up short against The International Home Wrecking Crew of Rain and Jetta. As part of Volume 22, LuFisto was able to defeat Wesna Busic in an International Wildcard Dream Match. She returned to Shimmer at the tapings of Volume 23, where she defeated the debuting Kellie Skater. Later in the night, she lost a rematch to Wesna after interference from her manager Annie Social. She came back victorious over Amber O'Neal, but she lost the chance to become Shimmer Champion against MsChif as part of Volume 26. On Volume 27, she had a number one contender's match with Amazing Kong, but both of them were counted out so they were both declared #1 contenders. As part of the main event of Volume 28, LuFisto lost a three-way elimination match with Amazing Kong and the eventual winner MsChif. =nCw Femmes Fatales (2009‚Äìpresent)= In early June 2009, the birth of a new all-female Canadian promotion, nCw Femmes Fatales, administered by LuFisto and Stephane Bruyere (the former booker of ALF) was announced. On September 5, LuFisto defeated Cheerleader Melissa in the main event of the inaugural show, making their record in singles competition 1‚Äì1. After the match, Sara Del Rey brutally attacked LuFisto. The two of them were scheduled to face each other at the second show on February 6, 2010. However, Del Rey was booked for a Ring of Honor Wrestling taping that same day, and when her replacement Ayako Hamada no-showed the event, LuFisto took on Cat Power instead. Power defeated LuFisto via disqualification after the referee caught LuFisto holding a steel chair, thrown to her by Power behind the referee's back. Later in the evening, the team of LuFisto and Cheerleader Melissa defeated Cat Power and Kalamity in a tag team match. On April 17, 2010, LuFisto suffered a stroke after a match for NCW. LuFisto, who has a family history of heart problems, decided to continue her career, after going through some tests. LuFisto made her return to the ring on June 5, defeating Sara Del Rey in the first round of a tournament to determine the first ever nCw Femmes Fatales Champion. On October 23, 2010, LuFisto first defeated Kalamity in the semifinals and then Portia Perez in the finals of the tournament to become the first nCw Femmes Fatales Champion. She would go on to lose the title to Kalamity on October 8, 2011. On April 4, 2015, LuFisto defeated nCw Femme Fatales Champion Courtney Rush and Saraya Knight to win the title for second time. On August 1, 2015, LuFisto lost the title to Jessika Black in a 3-Way match also involving Stacy Thibault. =Mexico (2012‚Äì2013)= Rey de Reyes On February 19, 2012, LuFisto made her debut for the Mexican promotion Original Pro-Lucha, defeating La Vaquerita to win the Lucha POP Women's Championship. On February 21, 2013, Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) announced that LuFisto had signed with the promotion. She made her debut on March 1, defeating Cynthia Moreno to advance to the finals of a tournament for the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship. On March 17 at Rey de Reyes, LuFisto was defeated by Faby Apache in a four-way elimination tournament final, which also included Mari Apache and Taya. =Women Superstars Uncensored (2012‚Äìpresent)= LuFisto made her debut in Women Superstars Uncensored after the announcement of a working relationship between WSU and NCW Femmes Fatales. This saw LuFisto and NCW Femmes Fatales Champion Kalamity debut with WSU in June. LuFisto's first match in WSU was a win at the fifth annual Uncensored Rumble on June 16, 2012 against Leva Bates. At Full Steam Ahead in October of that year, LuFisto faced off against one of her greatest rivals in Mercedes Martinez. The two wrestled to a thirty-minute time limit draw. After the match, it was announced the two would renew their rivalry up in Canada in November, this time in a Cage, at NCW Femmes Fatales X. In February at WSU An Ultraviolent Affair, LuFisto and Martinez squared off once more in a Falls Count Anywhere match to determine the number one contender for the WSU Championship. LuFisto defeated Martinez and was deemed the new number one contender to Jessicka Havok's WSU Championship. Due to Havok being stripped of the title, she defeated Athena at the WSU Queen and King of the Ring event on May 10 to become the champion. She lost the title in May 2015 to Cherry Bomb. =Shine Wrestling (2013present)= LuFisto made her debut in Shine Wrestling at Shine 7 on February 22, 2013, in a losing effort to Ivelisse V√©lez after an outside distraction by Made in Sin (Allysin Kay and Taylor Made).

Ivan appeared in fourteen American films from 1944 to 1954. Rosalind Muriel Pringle was the daughter of Stamford and Annie Pringle, who married in 1876 and divorced in 1881. In 1883, her mother married Charles Johnson and her daughter took his surname. By age ten, Ivan was performing as a concert pianist in England, but financial problems with her family caused her to cease studying piano when she was sixteen. On the London stage, she had the role of \\"Retty\\" in Tess (1900). She joined Sir Henry Irving's distinguished company and in America appeared as Mme. Thalhouet in Madame Sans GeneThe Drama, p. 16, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, Feb. 2, 1902. (1902). Ivan's first Broadway appearance was in The Master Builder (1907); her last was in The Corn Is Green (1940). One of her triumphs on the stage was as the \\"vampire\\" in A Fool There Was (1913).\\"Rosalind Ivan in A Fool There Was\\", p 55, The Buffalo Times, March 16, 1913.

A Democrat, he served one term each in the United States Senate (1893-1899) and House of Representatives (1891-1893). Earlier, he was a member of the Wisconsin State Senate and a Union Army officer in the American Civil War. He was the son of powerful railroad owner and Milwaukee financier Alexander Mitchell and used his inheritance on significant works of philanthropy in Milwaukee--he is the namesake of the Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory. Additionally, his son, U.S. Army Major General William Lendrum \\"Billy\\" Mitchell, is considered the father of the United States Air Force. Early life He was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Martha (Reed) and Alexander Mitchell, a wealthy banking magnate, politician, and Scottish American immigrant. He graduated from the Hampton, Connecticut, military academy and studied in Europe, spending time in both Munich, Bavaria, and Geneva, Switzerland. He returned to the United States in 1860 as the Civil War loomed. Civil War service During the American Civil War, Mitchell enlisted with the 24th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment in the summer of 1862. He was commissioned 2nd Lieutenant of Company I, under Captain Frederick A. Root. The regiment mustered into service August 21, 1862, and left the state on September 5 for Kentucky, for service in the Western Theater of the war. Arriving at Louisville, Kentucky, on September 20, the 24th Wisconsin was attached to III Corps of the Army of the Ohio. The regiment was quickly thrown into battle, confronting General Braxton Bragg and his Army of Mississippi, which had marched to the vicinity of Louisville as part of the Confederate offensive to seize control of Kentucky. They met the Confederates at the nearby town of Perryville, Kentucky, where they engaged in the Battle of Perryville on October 8, 1862. The 24th Wisconsin was held in reserve for most of the battle, but in the late afternoon was ordered to engage and pursued the enemy as they fled the field. They continued the pursuit of the fleeing Confederates until October 15, when they were ordered to abandon pursuit and turn back to the west, moving into Tennessee and going into camp near Nashville on November 22. At their Mill Creek camp, the Union command was reorganized as the Army of the Cumberland under Major General William Rosecrans. On December 27, they returned to the offensive against Bragg, who was now encamped along the Stones River, northwest of Murfreesboro, Tennessee. During this campaign, Lieutenant Mitchell was selected for special service in their brigade, working as a topographical aide to Brigadier General Joshua W. Sill. During the first hours of fighting at the Battle of Stones River, however, General Sill was killed in action while directing a counterattack. It fell to Lieutenant Mitchell to deliver the news to Colonel Nicholas Greusel of the 36th Illinois Infantry Regiment--who was next in line of seniority--that he must assume command of the brigade. Colonel Greusel was able to re-form the brigade after the confusion of the morning fighting and led them ably through the remainder of the battle. Colonel Greusel would later praise Lieutenant Mitchell in his official report of the battle. After the fighting, the Union army spent several months camped at Murfreesboro, transforming it into a major Union fortress and supply hub for the remainder of the war and securing the Union presence in Middle Tennessee. During this time, the 24th Wisconsin saw further resignations and promotions as the leadership was reshuffled. Mitchell returned to duties with his regiment, and, on January 17, 1863, he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant for Company E. While the Union Army of the Cumberland was reinforcing their position and reorganizing their force at Murfreesboro, the Confederate Army of Tennessee, under Bragg, was preparing a new defensive line along the Duck River and at strategic passes in the Highland Rim. That summer, the Army of the Cumberland was directed to engage Bragg as soon as possible to prevent him from sending additional forces to assist the Confederate defenders at the Siege of Vicksburg. Lieutenant Mitchell was with the army through the Battle of Hoover's Gap, after which Bragg abandoned Middle Tennessee and moved to defend Chattanooga. However, around this time the regiment surgeon diagnosed Lieutenant Mitchell as having a severe visual impairment. He was sent home to Wisconsin and discharged. Political career After returning from the war, Mitchell went to work as a farmer, clearing 480 acres of wilderness west of Milwaukee. In 1871, he entered politics, running for Wisconsin State Senate on the Democratic Party ticket in the 6th senatorial district (southern Milwaukee County). He was not a candidate for re-election in 1873, but returned to office with the 1875 election, in the same district. He declined re-nomination in 1877, but remained active in the state Democratic Party and for several years was chairman of the Milwaukee County Democratic Party. He was also elected by the 1887 Wisconsin Democratic convention to serve as a Wisconsin member of the Democratic National Committee. He was also active outside of politics and was chosen as President of the Milwaukee School Board for 1884 and 1885 and became a significant funder of Milwaukee's Soldiers' home. He was appointed by Congress to the board of managers for the National Home for Disabled Soldiers in 1886 and served on the board nearly until his death. After the death of his father in 1887, Mitchell took over several of the family interests and became much more prominent in state affairs; he also became well-respected in business for his shrewd management of the family assets. He became President of the Marine and Fire Insurance Company Bank--which his father had founded-- and had a significant stake in the Northwestern National Insurance Company. In 1888, after a storm destroyed several buildings on the state fair grounds, Mitchell spent freely from his own funds to rebuild the structures in time for the fair. That year, he was elected President of the state Agricultural Society. In 1890, Mitchell announced his intention to run for United States House of Representatives in Wisconsin's 4th congressional district. After a contentious caucus process, he reached the Wisconsin Democratic Party 4th district convention with strong support and was nominated on the first ballot, defeating Peter J. Somers and John Black. He won 56% of the vote in the general election, defeating Republican R. C. Spencer, Union Labor candidate Robert C. Schilling, and Prohibitionist Charles E. Reed, and went on to serve in the 52nd United States Congress. After his election to Congress, he was chosen as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and conducted an extensive operation to win Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate in the 1892 elections. He also declared his interest in the United States Senate seat which would be chosen in 1893 by the Legislature elected in 1892. The Democrats maintained their majority in the 41st Wisconsin Legislature, and on the 31st ballot, the Democratic caucus chose to support Mitchell as their senate nominee over John H. Knight and Edward S. Bragg. In the floor vote, Mitchell received 77 votes, John Coit Spooner received 46, and Edward S. Bragg received 1. Mitchell was considered one of the best-educated members of the Senate at the time. He continued to prioritize funding the needs of veterans. He supported the Wilson‚ÄìGorman Tariff Act, which levied a tariff which applied only to those earning more than $4,000 per year (then only about 10% of Americans). He was strongly opposed to the rising American imperialism of his era, and spoke out against the annexation of Hawaii and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. And although he personally opposed the populist, inflationary free silver policies of the Democrats, he remained loyal to the party. In 1896, he was suggested as a candidate for Vice President of the United States at the Democratic National Convention, though his name was not formally placed in nomination. He served in the Senate until 1899 and was not a candidate for renomination. After leaving the Senate, Mitchell traveled with his family to Europe again. He, along with one of his daughters, studied at Grenoble University in Grenoble, France, and they both received a diploma certifying their proficiency in French language and literature. The family returned to their farm in Greenfield, Wisconsin, in 1902. Mitchell's health deteriorated from this point. He died at his home on June 29, 1904, and was buried at the Mitchell family plot in Milwaukee's Forest Home Cemetery. Family and legacy Mitchell married twice, first to Bianca Coggswell and then Harriet Danforth Becker, who was a prominent member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. He had at least 12 children (7 with his first wife and 5 with his second) however only 7 survived to adulthood. Among his children was Major General Billy Mitchell, who is regarded as the father of the United States Air Force. Coincidentally, during the elder Mitchell's time with the 24th Wisconsin Infantry in the Civil War, he served alongside Arthur MacArthur Jr., whose son, Douglas MacArthur, would go on to serve as a juror on the court martial of Mitchell's son, Billy, in 1925. Another son, John Mitchell, was also an early American aviator who died in his fighter plane in 1917 in France. His daughter, Ruth Mitchell, was an author and gained some fame as a volunteer fighting the Germans with Yugoslav Chetniks in World War II. Mitchell was a collector of paintings, including works by Jules Breton, Jehan Georges Vibert, and Adolf Schreyer. He was a patron of the Layton Art Gallery, Milwaukee College, and the Milwaukee Hospital. He was an active member of several veterans communities, including the Grand Army of the Republic, the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, and the Society of the Army of the Cumberland. He contributed to the founding of the College of Agriculture at the University of Wisconsin and offered twenty scholarships for poor boys to attend the school. Finally, he was the original donor of land to form Mitchell Park, which is named in his honor. His papers, along with those of his father, are in the archives of the Wisconsin Historical Society.

Often based in or near schools, it provides supervision and recreational/educational facilities. In New Zealand these programs are commonly known as \\"OSCAR\\" . Most programs have a community base; some operate as private profit-making ventures. Out of School Hours Care programs are seen as important vehicles for promoting healthy child development by engaging children in physical and creative activities and by linking children with other community organisations and clubs. However, the important role of these programs is the development of children's life skills, the provision of play opportunities and supporting children to engage within their community.  OSCAR Care Definition  OSCAR Care stands for Out of School Care and Recreation. It is often called After School Care. This definition is most commonly used in New Zealand for the sector of the childcare industry that caters for children aged 5 to 13 years of age. Predominately this type of childcare is delivered during before school hours, after school hours or during school holiday breaks. OSCAR services are not delivered by government departments, but rather individuals (sole traders), companies, non-profit groups (such as churches) and school-owned operations.  Establishment  Many OSCAR services are established due to community demand. Many services seek certification as an approved provider of OSCAR services from Child Youth and Family (CYF), the government department tasked with developing, maintaining and enforcing standards in the OSCAR industry. Funding for OSCAR services or programs comes from three main sources; parent cash fees paid to the provider, Work & Income subsidies (the government social welfare department) and large grants from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD).  CYF Standards for Approved OSCAR Programs  CYF consulted with OSCAR service providers, and other interested stakeholders, to develop the 11 standards (or rather standard 'areas') by which an OSCAR service is approved. Suitable policies and procedures must be in place to account for: Program environment, Program operation, Health and Safety, Child Protection, Supervision, Emergencies, Staff, Buildings and Facilities, Recordkeeping, Finance, and Camps (if delivered during holidays, though this often covers 24 hours or overnight, including sleeping arrangements). While these 11 standards form the basis of approval, CYF is really looking for the right Systems, Venue, and People.  Recreation Focus  This sector does not provide education or curriculum delivery as OSCAR care is a recreation based service, by definition, and by delivery. The OSCAR industry has a national body, the OSCAR Foundation. By contractual agreement, the OSCAR Foundation provides monitoring of the industry by providing advisers in some regions, delivering a yearly conference and ensuring government funded programmes are being delivered by yearly visits. With CYF approval, programmes can offer parents discounted fees and may apply for yearly assistance funding from the MSD.  Support and Quality Control  In the two large regions of Canterbury and Auckland, local networks of OSCAR service providers have secured an agreement to receive funding directly, thus being able to employ their own OSCAR advisers. Regional networks (OSCN in Auckland and The Christchurch OSCAR Network in Canterbury) the advisers report on service delivery to the OSCAR Foundation. The OSCAR Foundation, formally the national body went into liquidation in May 2012.

A film version was also produced in 1972. Plot Trinity and Brother Dave are a pair of devil-bats looking for a party to break up. They come across a party in Harlem. Although Trinity is eager, Dave warns him not to touch it. \\"When black folks throw a party, they don't play!\\" Trinity joins the party, already in progress, thrown by Miss Maybell in honor of her niece Earnestine's birthday. Trinity first tries to break the records (\\"you can't have a party without music\\"), but finds that they are unbreakable. He drinks an entire bottle of liquor, thinking he has depleted their supply of alcohol, but finds out that all of the guests have brought their own bottles, and when he tries to eat all of the sandwiches, another plate is brought in. Trinity finds himself unwilling to continue being mean after he insults Earnestine, making her cry. Trinity apologizes to her, and tells her that he has fallen for her. Three more guests show up, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, and their college-educated son Harold. Earnestine ignores Trinity for Harold. Trinity becomes jealous. Brother Dave arrives in human form, eager to break up the party, but Trinity is unwilling to. Mr. Johnson tells Harold not to get involved with Earnestine, because her family is too \\"common,\\" and he can't risk the big future he has ahead of him. Earnestine approaches both Harold and Trinity to dance, but they are pulled back by Mr. Johnson and Dave. Dave persuades Trinity to try to break up the party before midnight, when they will both be turned into the thing that they pretend to be: human beings. As time runs short, Dave and Trinity find themselves at the dinner table with the rest of the guests. Dave insults Mrs. Johnson, prompting her to leave with her husband and son. The rest of the guests tell Dave that they're glad that they left. After the dinner, Trinity stands up and announces that he and Earnestine are getting engaged, an announcement which infuriates Dave. Dave makes one last attempt to break up the party by trying to make a move on Miss Maybell. When Dave finds that she is all too willing, he turns himself into a cockroach and tries to sneak out the door before being smashed by Miss Maybell.

Along with the job, Van Peebles was given an apartment in a posh neighborhood on the lower east side of Manhattan. On a very hot day, Van Peebles was lounging out in front of the apartment, and an old black lady came down the street and told Van Peebles that she wanted some water and to use the bathroom. The woman thanked Van Peebles, and a few days later, Van Peebles received a telephone call from her inviting him to a party she was throwing for her niece. When he returned to France, he thought of what would happen if these wonderful, kind, open people were invaded by imps bent on destroying their party. The story became the basis for a novel, Harlem Party, and later a French-language musical play, which Van Peebles later translated into English, and made as a film in 1973.Van Peebles, Melvin.

Peaking at #10 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, it was the duo‚Äôs most successful single, and they are often regarded as a one- hit wonder for the selection, mainly because the duo‚Äôs only other Hot 100 entry (‚ÄúIf Love is in Your Heart‚Äù) stalled at #86 a few months later. The title never appears as such in the recording, though the nine mentions of ‚ÄúReach Out IN the Darkness‚Äù in the lyrics come close. The song is notable for its repeated opening line, \\"I think it's so groovy now that people are finally getting together.\\" Production The song was written and composed by James ‚ÄúJim‚Äù Post, who together with his then-wife Catherine ‚ÄúCathy‚Äù Post (nee Conn) comprised the duo Friend & Lover. It was recorded in Nashville for the Verve Forecast label. Ray Stevens played keyboards and arranged the strings, with Joe South and Bill Lowery producing. The Verve Records Discography has a completely different account of the song and its flip \\"Time On Your Side (You're Only 15 Years Old)\\" being recorded in New York City on 23 August 1967, with the sides reversed, and \\"If Love Is In Your Heart\\" recorded the same day. The 1969 follow-up album, also titled Reach Out of the Darkness, was recorded in Atlanta and produced by Buddy Buie. In popular culture The song was featured in the 1988 film 1969 and in the TV series Night Stalker (episode 6) and Beverly Hills, 90210: \\"The Time Has Come Today\\" (season 4, episode 25). The track was used in the closing scene and credits on the AMC series Mad Men: \\"A Man With a Plan\\" (season 6, episode 7). The scene in question was June 1968, when the news of Robert Kennedy's assassination was breaking on television, with characters watching the story unfold in stunned silence, some weeping.Music from Mad Men, Season 6, Episode 7 Retrieved June 16, 2015 The song continued to play, superimposed over audio of the news reports from the assassination, during the closing credits. Krush sampled the song for their song \\"Let's Get Together (So Groovy Now),\\" from the soundtrack to the comedy film Mo' Money, starring Damon Wayans and Stacey Dash.[ Mo'Money Soundtrack review  AllMusic.com] In a concert in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park on 2 September 2007, as the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Summer of Love, Jim Post contradicted Unterberger's album sleeve notes when he claimed that, when he was in New York City, he wrote and composed the song (loosely corroborating the aforementioned Verve Records Discography) and that the song became popular in San Francisco after a Selective Service sit-in there (there was a Selective Service Office protest in San Francisco on 16 October 1967), then went to the Midwest and the South, finally taking off in New York City corresponding to Martin Luther King's assassination in April 1968. However, an extensive search of music surveys currently available on-line shows instead that, depending on the survey, the song had no noticeable exposure until several weeks after that assassination, peaked anywhere from mid May to late July with none of the peaks attributable to any crisis, and in any event possessed essentially none of the claimed behavior. On New York's WABC Music Radio surveys, the song belatedly debuted at number 50 on the week of June 4, 1968 (the day before the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy), rose to #13 the following week and eventually peaked at number 1 the week of July 23 before falling off rapidly.WABC Music Power Survey for Week of June 4, 1968WABC Music Power Survey for Week of June 11, 1968WABC Music Power Survey for Week of July 23, 1968 References Category:1967 songs Category:1967 singles Category:Verve Forecast Records singles ","title":"Reach Out of the Darkness"},{"id":"2743227","text":"Raymond Creekmore (May 5, 1905 - May 1984) was a prolific artist, author and sailboat designer. Creekmore (known to his friends as Creeky) was an American artist who, in the beginning of his career, \\"wandered\\" extensively, using his experiences in observation and his direct and expressive draftsmanship as vehicles to bring the sensitivity and ways of life in foreign lands to America's local shores. Creekmore was born in Portsmouth, Virginia. He moved to Baltimore, Maryland, graduating from the Maryland Institute School of Mechanical Arts (now \\"MICA\\") in 1930. During his days as an art student, he became friends with another student artist, Leonard Bahr and they shared a studio for a while as well as a love of sailing, and remained lifelong friends. Creekmore was an easy-going student with a great sense of humor. After graduation in 1930, he worked his way through Europe with a sketch pad, and in 1933, spent five months in Mexico. By 1936, he set out again \\"on a shoestring\\" with his sketch pad as means of support. He stayed in villages in Japan, India, Mongolia, and China, and kept illustrated journals. Between trips, he worked as a Baltimore Evening Sun staff illustrator, with sketches of his travels and of local news reports published regularly. One such local report told of his rides in a garbage truck on their late night run through the City streets‚Äîa bit of humor on what was normally encountered in that type of business. He also won prizes for his sketches of Baltimore neighborhoods in the Evening Sun sponsored b&w; sketch contests. His drawings of the Orient comprised the first one-man show at the Baltimore Museum of Art that they had displayed in 6 years. In 1937, he published in Art Instruction (a national art journal), \\"A Baltimore Hiker in Nippon, Becoming Acquainted With The Japanese Alps,\\" including sketches and photographs of his trip from the previous year. And in 1938, he participated in a Courbet Symposium and illustrated a booklet for the Peabody Conservatory of Music. Captain Creekmore was part of the D-day invasion of France. He sketched these gliders after landing in Normandy. Creekmore joined the Army Air Force during World War II and became a Captain. He was assigned to draw Army pilots in their varied duties including the Tokyo Superfortress raids and sketches of the Army in Guam, Puerto Rico, Greenland, the Baffin Islands, and in Newfoundland‚Äîwhere he slept in an igloo. He still kept a writing journal of his experiences during the war. Meanwhile, he had married and had a son. The family, at that time, lived in Mamaroneck, New York, and after the war, taught at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute. During this time too, he also started to write and illustrate children's books, and in 1944, he co-authored a book with actor Joe E.

In 1950, Creekmore designed and built his own unique sloop on his father-in-law's property near the Magothy River in Anne Arundel Co., Maryland, after reading how to build one in a book. On a low budget and with innovative techniques, he built a 5-layered mahogany hull over a handmade mold. Eventually, that became his business producing \\"Creekmore\\" sailboats. He moved from New York to Miami and was in that business in 1959, when the Bahrs went to visit him. Publications include the \\"American Artist\\" (1944), and the Baltimore \\"Evening Sun (1938, 1939, 1942, 1945, 1946)\\". Creekmore exhibited widely and reproductions of his drawings, books, and boat designs can be found online.

Written by Mario Van Peebles, the film is about a rapper who winds up sharing his body with the soul of a dead fashion designer, switching between personalities every time he is struck on the head.  Plot  Melvin Van Peebles acts as the film's narrator, introducing the film's main characters. Yves Malmaison (Richard Fancy) is a world-famous French fashion designer, a flaming homosexual with a preference for red hair, he once experimented with an American woman, and thus he has a son, Sebastian (Ilan Mitchell-Smith). Chilly D (Mario Van Peebles) is a struggling rapper who has been stealing dresses made by Malmaison to redesign and give to his many girlfriends. On the night of a big fashion show, Malmaison is poisoned, and Chilly D is chased by the same people who poisoned the fashion designer. Through a turn of events, the souls of both men wind up in Chilly D's body. Several days later, following Malmaison's funeral, he wakes up in a hospital to discover, to his shock, that he is no longer in his own body. Stumbling the streets, confused, Yves as Chilly tries to piece together elements of his former life, with no such luck. Making things even more difficult is the fact that every time they are struck or hit, they switch between their two personalities, leading to confusion and disorientation for people they bump into. Yves manages to convince his son Sebastian that it is him, and they try to find out who killed him, finding that drug smugglers are trying to take over the company. At the end of the film, Chilly D manages to have all of Malmaison's memories, but still be himself, and so he and Sebastian go into business together. Production and release When the film went into production, Melvin Van Peebles had not made a film since Don't Play Us Cheap. Van Peebles instead worked on theater and television productions, wrote novels and traded on the floor of the American Stock Exchange. His son, Mario Van Peebles, wrote the screenplay for Identity Crisis during the production of Jaws: The Revenge, and offered it to his father. They formed Block & Chip Productions to produce the film. They cowrote a book about the making of the film's production entitled No Identity Crisis. The film was screened at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. When Melvin Van Peebles was unable to negotiate a theatrical deal at the Festival, it was announced that the film would be released direct-to-video. Mario Van Peebles stated that he never assumed that it would be released theatrically. The film was promoted as a \\"rap-packed action comedy in the tradition of House Party\\".

Written and directed by Maria von Heland, it tells the story of two teenage girls in Berlin, one of whom takes revenge on the daughter of her father's lover. A subplot involves a third girl who drifts into pornography and comes to a bad end. As part of the coming of age tale, the girls lose their virginity and experiment with drugs. Plot Kati and Steffi, inseparable since childhood, are teenagers at school. Kati endures a modest and difficult home life with a neurotic mother but Steffi's family are well off and harmonious. Everything changes when in a night club the two see Steffi's father entwined with another woman. Furious at this treachery, Steffi plots revenge against the woman's daughter Tessa. First she sends the girl to audition for a band, but it emerges that she can sing well and the band like her. That having failed, Steffi sends her to a pornographer, having got the address from a schoolmate Yvonne, who posed to earn some money so that she could leave home. Kati gets worried over Steffi's obsessive behaviour and, tracking down Tessa, rescues her as she is being raped by the pornographer. Furious, Tessa's mother storms round to the home of Steffi's parents and tells them what's been going on, upon which Steffi's mother leaves home. In the meantime, a nationwide police search has been launched for the missing Yvonne. Suspecting the pornographer, Kati recounts all she knows to the police, who tell her Yvonne has in fact been murdered. Going to see Steffi, she tells her that it was she who saved Tessa and so triggered the crisis in Steffi's family. When Steffi does not appear at school next day, Kati breaks into her home to find she has slashed both wrists. By calling an ambulance, Kati saves her life and at the hospital Steffi's parents turn up, apparently reconciled. Kati's mother at last shows sympathy towards her daughter and in a final shot the recovering Steffi makes it up with Kati.

He has provided commentary for the Nine Network's coverage of rugby league since joining the network in 1992 and has also hosted The Footy Show since its beginnings in 1994 opposite co-host Peter Sterling, until 2017. An Australian Kangaroos test and Queensland State of Origin representative lock or second- row forward, Vautin played club football in Brisbane with Wests, before moving to Sydney in 1979 to play with Manly-Warringah, whom he would captain to the 1987 NSWRL premiership. He also played for Sydney's Eastern Suburbs, and in England for St Helens. After playing, Vautin became a sports commentator for the Nine Network, calling rugby league games alongside Ray Warren and the recently retired Peter Sterling. Later, during the Super League war, he was hired to coach Queensland in the 1995 State of Origin series and took the Maroons to an upset 3‚Äì0 whitewash of series favourite New South Wales. According to Vautin, he earned his nickname \\"Fatty\\" soon after joining Manly in 1979. While being shown around Brookvale Oval by club secretary Ken Arthurson, he walked past retired Manly premiership captain Fred Jones who was in conversation with club and Kangaroos fullback Graham Eadie. Jones asked Eadie \\"Who is that fatty?\\", and the name stuck. Playing career Vautin made his name in the late 1970s. He played for the Wests Panthers in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership, the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in Sydney, St. Helens in England, Queensland in the State of Origin and the Australia national rugby league team. He finished his playing career with Sydney club the Eastern Suburbs Roosters in 1991. =Club=Wests Panthers He was graded as an 18-year-old by Brisbane Rugby League club Wests as a in 1978, sometimes playing opposite another talented young lock from Valley's destined for future greatness as a named Wally Lewis. Vautin was signed by Manly-Warringah club Secretary Ken Arthurson in late 1978 after Arthurson had viewed a tape of him scoring a 75-metre try from a scrum for Wests at Lang Park, and moved from Brisbane to play for the defending NSWRFL premiers starting in 1979. Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles After playing Reserve Grade for Manly in the opening round of the 1979 season, against St. George at Kogarah Oval, Vautin went on to play in grand finals with Manly in 1982 and 1983, going down to Parramatta both times. Vautin was named captain of Manly-Warringah in 1985 by coach Bob Fulton. Vautin enjoyed success in leading Manly to an 18‚Äì8 victory over the Canberra Raiders in the 1987 Grand Final, the last played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Before the 1987 season had started, the Manly club board had wanted Bob Fulton to install 1986 Kangaroo tour second rower Noel Cleal as club captain , replacing Vautin who had captained the side since 1985. Following the grand final victory in 1987, he traveled with Manly to England for the 1987 World Club Challenge against their champions, Wigan. The home side won a try-less game 8‚Äì2 at Central Park.1987 World Club Challenge - Wigan vs Manly-Warringah During the match, Vautin was tackled over the sideline in front of the main grandstand. After easily being the best side in the Sydney competition during the year, and after the unbeaten 1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, the Manly players later admitted to over- confidence and took the game far too lightly, treating the trip more as a holiday than anything serious and actually continued their grand final celebrations while in England.Wigan v Manly - 1987 World Club Challenge highlights St. Helens Vautin and Manly teammate Michael O'Connor both signed to play for the Alex Murphy coached St. Helens during the 1988‚Äì89 Rugby Football League season on 2 August 1988. Fatty would go on to captain St. Helens in his last match for them, a 27‚Äì0 loss to Wigan in the 1989 Challenge Cup Final played on 29 April 1989 at Wembley Stadium in front of 78,000 fans. It was the first time since 1952 that a team had been held scoreless.Paul Vautin. saints.org.uk Vautin played 21 games for St. Helens in 1988‚Äì89 and made his d√©but in English club football on 9 October 1988 in a 30‚Äì22 win over Hull Kingston Rovers at Craven Park in Hull. Eastern Suburbs Roosters He signed with the Eastern Suburbs Roosters for two years, where he even spent time in reserve grade after being dropped by coach Mark Murray - a former Queensland and Australian teammate, before retiring at the end of the 1991 NSWRL season. His last game for the out of contention Roosters was an 8-42 loss to eventual premiers Penrith at the Sydney Football Stadium on 25 August, the final round of the season. =State of Origin= Vautin made his Origin d√©but for the Maroons in game 2 of the 1982 series. He was originally selected as the starting lock forward but was moved to the bench on the day of the game by coach Arthur Beetson in favor of Rod Morris who ended up putting in a man of the match performance. Vautin came on in the second half and, with Queensland leading 8‚Äì7, scored the winning try for the Maroons that kept the series alive after New South Wales had won game 1. Queensland went on to win game 3 of the series at the SCG where Vautin again started from the bench. In 1984, Vautin and Manly teammate Chris Close became the last Queensland representative players to be selected for the annual NSW City vs NSW Country game, when he was selected in the second row for NSW City for the game at the SCG, won 38‚Äì12 by City. For the next nine years, with the exception of 1986 when he was not considered for selection due to his broken arm, he was a regular in those star-studded Queensland sides which included test captains Wally Lewis and Mal Meninga, as well as Gene Miles, Gary Belcher, Bob Lindner, Greg Dowling and Allan Langer, and Manly teammates Chris Close, Dale Shearer, John Ribot and Kerry Boustead, and produced many inspirational performances over 22 games. He had the honor of captaining the Queensland side in the first game of the 1988 State of Origin series at the new Sydney Football Stadium, and the first game of the 1990 series at Olympic Park in Melbourne - the first Origin game in Australia played outside of Brisbane or Sydney. Both times he captained the team was when Lewis was ruled out with injury. At the time he became only the third Queensland Origin captain at the time alongside Beetson and Lewis. Game 1 of the 1990 series was Vautin's last game of State of Origin football as he was dumped after Queensland lost 0‚Äì8 to NSW after having won both the previous two series 3‚Äì0. =International= Vautin made his test d√©but for Australia in 1982 in the first test against New Zealand, at Lang Park in Brisbane under the coaching of his original Manly coach Frank Stanton. However, after playing for Queensland and Australia, and helping Manly to second on the ladder and then into the grand final against minor premiers Parramatta, he was not selected for the end of season 1982 Kangaroo tour. He returned to the test team for Australia's mid-season tour to New Zealand in 1983, and in 1984 was selected for the second Ashes Test against Great Britain at Lang Park, copping an elbow to the face from replacement Mick Adams as he tackled the Lions forward, resulting in a fractured cheekbone during the 18‚Äì6 win which saw Australia retain The Ashes. Vautin's injury kept him out of the third test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, and caused him to miss 11 games of the 1984 NSWRL season. Vautin played 13 test matches during his career, touring New Zealand twice in 1985 and 1989. In addition to the thirteen tests he played for Australia, he played two tour games in New Zealand in 1985 and three tour games in 1989. Vautin was selected for Australia in their successful 1988 Ashes series against the Great Britain tourists. As a result of being selected for the first test, Vautin missed playing in Manly's 30‚Äì0 demolition of Great Britain at Brookvale Oval only four days before the first test. Vautin was the vice-captain of Australia's mid-season tour of New Zealand in 1989, captaining the team in three tour games (Wally Lewis was the tour and test captain). Fatty captained the Australian team (now coached by Bob Fulton) to a 50‚Äì18 win over a New Zealand XIII at the Palmerston North Showgrounds in the opening game of the tour. He would later captain the side in another tour game against Auckland for the only loss of the tour, the Australians surprised 26‚Äì24 at Carlaw Park (the Kangaroos first non-test loss since losing to Widnes on the 1978 Kangaroo tour), before captaining the team from the unfamiliar position of for a 28‚Äì10 win over Wellington at the Basin Reserve. During his career, Vautin often had to compete with players such as Ray Price, Wayne Pearce and fellow Queenslander Bob Lindner for the Australian Lock-forward position, and as such was often selected in the second row. Of his 13 test matches, Vautin played 8 in the second row, 4 at lock and one (a 70‚Äì8 win over Papua New Guinea in Wagga Wagga in 1988) from the bench. Coaching career Loyal to his Channel Nine employer, Vautin was a vocal supporter of the Kerry Packer-backed Australian Rugby League during the Super League war which started in 1995. With only limited coaching experience having coached the Brisbane Capitols to the Winfield State League championship in 1992 (winning all 5 games), he was considered an inferior replacement for dual premiership winning coach Wayne Bennett who was originally named to return as coach of the 1995 Queensland State of Origin team (Bennett had previously coached the Maroons from 1986-1988), and with Queensland having lost the last three consecutive series and being given a handful of young and inexperienced players, Vautin and Queensland were expected to be easy prey for NSW, who could still boast almost half a side of international players as well as Origin and dual premiership winning coach Phil Gould. However, his representative coaching d√©but took a fairy tale turn when the young Maroons, without any of the stars from Super League-aligned clubs (most notably the Wayne Bennett coached Brisbane Broncos), completed a 3‚Äì0 series whitewash of New South Wales that year. With the Super League players available for selection in the 1996 State of Origin series, Queensland were rated a chance of retaining their crown but lost the series 0‚Äì3. After losing the 1997 series 1‚Äì2, Vautin was replaced as Queensland coach the following year by Wayne Bennett. Post-football career In 2000, Vautin was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league. =Commentary= After Manly had been knocked out of the finals series, Paul Vautin made his television commentary d√©but during the 1988 NSWRL Grand Final with the ABC alongside long time caller David Morrow. Vautin's introduction to television commentary did not go to plan though as he thought they were pre-recording the introduction to the game and dropped the \\"F-bomb\\", only to find out that it was in fact being broadcast live around Australia. Vautin was then signed by the Nine Network and has been a regular commentator for Nine's Wide World of Sports' coverage of rugby league matches alongside Ray Warren and Peter Sterling since 1992. Paul Vautin (on the left) at 2016 TV Week Logie Awards =The Footy Show= Vautin has hosted The NRL Footy Show since 1994, propelling him to TV stardom. He suffered a serious concussion in 2005 filming for the show in a segment called \\"Dare-Devil Dudes\\", when he hit his head on concrete, with a helmet luckily minimising the damage. He did not host for a period of about 10 weeks. From 1992 to 2004, he was a mainstay of the Channel Nine match commentary team along with Peter Sterling and Ray Warren, calling club, Origin and international games. Since the concussion incident, he had focussed on his Footy Show appearances but was still part of the broader Nine expert commentary team for big fixtures like the State of Origin. Speculation existed that 2017 would be Vautin's last season as host of The Footy Show. In October 2017, Vautin was axed from The Footy Show.

It airs music programming 24 hours a day. WYEP is run by the Pittsburgh Community Broadcasting Corporation and is licensed to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The station operates on 91.3 MHz with a signal strength of 18,000 watts of ERP. History WYEP on a SPARC HD Radio receiver with PSD. WYEP, a non- commercial, independent radio station, began broadcasting on April 30, 1974 on 91.5 MHz. Prior to using its own frequency, the Pittsburgh Community Broadcasting Corporation (the licensee which was incorporated in 1972 solely for the purpose of building and operating a community based, non-commercial radio station) produced three hourly music and public affairs programs under agreement with WDUQ 90.5. The programs scheduled at 4 p.m. provided an example of the content WYEP would broadcast. The radio station studios were constructed by volunteers. It was located in the South Oakland area of Pittsburgh, 4 Cable Place, in a former police horse stable. In its early days, it was principally operated by volunteers knowledgeable in music or an area of public affairs. In 1979, WYEP filed to move to 91.3 MHz and upgrade its signal to 18 kW. Transmission facilities were moved from atop the Cathedral of Learning on the University of Pittsburgh campus to a tower above the Monongahela River near Hazelwood. The move became effective in 1983 and also saw WIUP-FM 91.3 in Indiana move to 90.1. In 1987, the station reorganized and relocated their broadcast facility to the campus of Chatham University in Pittsburgh's East End. In 1994, the station moved to Birmingham Place on the South Side of Pittsburgh. In early 2006, the station began broadcasting from the new WYEP Community Broadcast Center, located in the Bedford Square section of Pittsburgh's South Side. In September 2006, the WYEP Community Broadcast Center received a LEED-NC Silver rating, making it environmentally friendly and \\"the first green station in the nation\\" . In 2011, WYEP purchased the license for WDUQ from Duquesne University, and launched an NPR News and information format station, 90.5 WESA. The staff and management of 90.5 WESA were co-located at the Community Broadcast Center. In 2014, WYEP celebrated its 40th anniversary on the air. In 2016, the boards of WYEP and WESA merged, becoming the Pittsburgh Community Broadcasting Corp. WYEP is a National Public Radio member. It broadcasts and streams music programming 24 hours a day.

It was opened in 1862, originally named the Agricultural Hall and from 1884 the Royal Agricultural Hall, for holding agricultural shows. It was the home of the Royal Smithfield Club's Smithfield Show from 1862 to 1938. It hosted the Royal Tournament from its inauguration in 1880 until the event became too large for the venue and moved to Olympia in the early years of the 20th century. It hosted the first Crufts dog show in 1891. During the Second World War, the hall was commandeered by the Government, and from 1943, following the destruction of Mount Pleasant sorting office in an air raid, the Parcels Depot was moved to the hall.

According to the official Islington Libraries compilation, the Royal Agricultural Hall had its origins when in 1798 the Duke of Bedford, Sir Joseph Banks and other nobles and gentlemen decided to form the Smithfield Club, which would hold annual exhibitions of livestock, agricultural produce and agricultural implements. Following some 40 years of exhibiting, first in Smithfield at Wooton‚Äôs Livery Stables near Smithfield Meat Market then at a site in the Barbican, the club moved in 1839 to premises in Baker Street. However it outgrew these and it was then proposed that the club erect a hall large enough to accommodate their annual display and also to be available for other shows. The foundation stone was laid in 1861 ‚Äì although a large part of the building had already been completed, and held its first exhibition in 1862. When built it was one of the largest exhibition halls in the world. It was this building that was the original basis of the present hall, which has expanded on this site so that the main exhibition hall now covers . It hosted the Royal Tournament from its inauguration in 1880 until the event became too large for the venue and moved to Olympia in the early years of the 20th century. Sporting events included six-day cycle races ‚Äì the first event being held at the Agricultural Hall in 1878.

He was one of the all-time great halfbacks and a major contributor to Parramatta Eels' dominance of the New South Wales Rugby League premiership in the 1980s. Sterling played eighteen Tests for the Australian national team between 1982 and 1988. He also played in thirteen State of Origins for New South Wales, winning man of the match on four occasions (one of them being the 1987 exhibition match played in the USA). He played in four premiership- winning sides with Parramatta in 1981‚Äì1983 and 1986 and has been inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame. His time spent playing for English club Hull F.C. also earned him membership in their hall of fame. Early life Sterling was born in Toowoomba and raised in Raymond Terrace and Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia. He commenced his playing career at the age of fourteen when he joined the Wagga Wagga Kangaroo Panthers in 1974.now called Wagga Wagga Kangaroos WAGGA KANGAROOS JUNIOR RUGBY LEAGUE INC. As a teenager he spent several years living at RAAF Base Wagga, where his father was serving as a dental technician. Sterling then moved to Sydney, where he attended the Patrician Brothers' College on a scholarship. Playing career Sterling compensated for a lack of size and pace with control and organisational skills that allowed Parramatta's all-star back line of Brett Kenny, Mick Cronin, Steve Ella and Eric Grothe a great deal of ball. His kicking, backed up by Kenny and Ray Price's superb chasing, often gave Parramatta an advantage in territory. His fast mind meant that he rarely made a wrong decision.. He was an effective defender rare to miss a tackle, and often in position to secure a loose ball. He joined the Parramatta Eels in 1978 making his first appearance as a during the 1978 finals series, and played his first game as the Eels halfback in the 17‚Äì11 Minor-Semi replay loss to eventual premiers Manly. After a few games at in 1979, Sterling shifted to halfback and established himself as a player to watch in 1980. 1981 saw the Jack Gibson coached Eels win their first Grand Final with a 20‚Äì11 win over the Tommy Raudonikis led Newtown Jets, with Sterling's superb skill and control one of the decisive factors. He made his State of Origin d√©but for NSW in the 1981 State of Origin game, setting up a try for Mick Cronin, though the Wally Lewis led Queenslanders turned a 10-point half time deficit into a 7-point, 22‚Äì15 win. Sterling himself admitted he was a surprise choice for NSW as he had only made his representative d√©but a few weeks earlier when he played for City Seconds and rated himself as fifth in line for the NSW job. He was selected over his long-time rival for the NSW halfback spot, Canterbury- Bankstown's Steve Mortimer who had debuted for Australia in their two test series win over France only weeks before the Origin game. In 1982, Parramatta could seemingly do no wrong, winning the Minor Premiership by four games over Manly. Though they were beaten 20‚Äì0 by Manly in the Major semi-final, the Eels then thrashed Eastern Suburbs 33‚Äì0 in the Preliminary Final, before going on to turn the tables on the Sea Eagles with a 21‚Äì8 in the Grand Final at the Sydney Cricket Ground to win their second successive premiership. Sterling was then chosen for the 1982 Kangaroo tour, and along with Queensland halfback Mark Murray was backup to incumbent test halfback Steve Mortimer, despite having not played in the 1982 State of Origin series. After travelling with part of the team to Perth to face a Western Australian team and thus missing a place in Australia's first ever test against Papua New Guinea, Sterling was presented a golden opportunity by coach Frank Stanton when he was chosen for the first game of the tour against English club side Hull Kingston Rovers. Sterling went about cementing his place in the Kangaroos \\"A\\" side and went on to make his Test d√©but for Australia in the first Ashes Test against Great Britain at Boothferry Park in Hull. The 1982 Kangaroos went on to become the first team to go through Great Britain and France undefeated, earning them the nickname \\"The Invincibles\\", and was a personal success for Sterling who played in all five tests against Great Britain and France, and cemented his place as the world's best halfback. In 1983, Sterling played in Australia's win in the first test against New Zealand at Carlaw Park in Auckland, but wasn't selected for Australia's shock 12‚Äì19 second Test loss at Lang Park when Murray was preferred. He was named man-of-the-match in Game 2 of the State of Origin series at the SCG, a game which saw the NSW side with an almost all-Parramatta backline, with Neil Hunt and Eric Grothe (wings), Mick Cronin and Steve Ella (centres) and Sterling and Brett Kenny (halves), while the Blues, who defeated Qld 10‚Äì6, were also captained by Eels forward Ray Price. Sterling then helped Parramatta to a third successive Grand Final win with an 18‚Äì6 win, again over runaway minor premiers Manly. Following his third successive premiership and his fifth overall, Jack Gibson, a man Peter Sterling has nothing but high praise for as both a person and a coach, shocked the establishment and resigned as Parramatta coach. Following the 1982 Kangaroo Tour, Sterling had been highly sought after by English clubs and he went on to play for Hull F.C. in the 1983‚Äì84 English season. Sterling played , and was man of the match winning the White Rose Trophy in Hull FC's 29‚Äì12 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1984 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1984‚Äì85 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull, on Saturday 27 October 1984. He was then chosen for Game 1 of the 1984 State of Origin series, but lost his place to Steve Mortimer for the rest of the series. Sterling was then overlooked for the home Ashes series against Great Britain in 1984, but would still go on to win the Rugby League Week Player of the Year award for the first time. In the 1984 Grand Final, Sterling and longtime partner in crime Brett Kenny had few opportunities against Mortimers Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs whose forwards dominated the Eels pack and gave the star pairing little room to move. The narrow 6‚Äì4 loss to the Bulldogs ended the now John Monie coached Parramatta's bid for a 4th successive premiership. Sterling did not play for Parramatta, in the first half of 1985 as he returned to England to again link with Hull. Peter Sterling played in Hull FC's 0‚Äì12 defeat by Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1984‚Äì85 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1984‚Äì85 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull on Saturday 26 January 1985. Though he was relatively quiet upon his return to Parramatta, at the end of the season Sterling's skill allowed Parramatta to defeat Balmain (twice, the second a 32‚Äì4 win in the Minor-Semi) and Penrith (Minor Preliminary-Semi), to move from doubtful finalists to the Preliminary Final ‚Äì where a ruthless Canterbury side on their way to a second successive premiership, easily accounted for the Eels 26‚Äì0. As a result of his decision to play in England and miss the first part of the NSWRL premiership, Sterling lost his place in the NSW side in the 1985 State of Origin series to Steve Mortimer, who led the Blues to their first ever series win over Queensland. He also miss his chance to regain his test place for the mid-season tour of New Zealand in 1985, with the halfback role shared between Mark Murray and Manly's versatile utility Des Hasler. By missing both Origin and Test selection in 1985, Sterling missed the opportunity to link with the coach who gave him his first grade d√©but at Parramatta Terry Fearnley, who coached both representative teams. While playing for Hull in the early part of 1985, Sterling led the team into the 1985 Challenge Cup Final against Wigan, which also included a number of internationals such as; fullback Gary Kemble, wingers Dane O'Hara and James Leuluai and his halves partner Fred Ah Kuoi (all NZ), centre Garry Schofield (GB), Parramatta second-rower John Muggleton (Aus), and goal kicking forward (and Hull captain) Lee Crooks (GB), Sterling played in Hull FC's 24‚Äì28 defeat by Wigan in the 1985 Challenge Cup Final during the 1984‚Äì85 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 4 May 1985, in front of a crowd of 99,801, in what is regarded as the most marvellous cup final in living memory, which Hull narrowly lost after fighting back from 12‚Äì28 down at half-time, with Sterling's Parramatta halves partner Brett Kenny (playing for Wigan) was voted man of the match winning the Lance Todd Trophy. Sterling, who produced a great game in both attack and defense, had gone into the game as one of the shortest priced favourites to win the Lance Todd Trophy, with bookmakers in Hull allegedly (according to BBC commentator Ray French during the telecast of the Cup Final) refusing to field any more bets on Sterling in the week leading up to the game. 1986 saw Sterling almost carry a clean sweep of the major awards ‚Äì except the Rothmans Medal ‚Äì and win the inaugural Clive Churchill Medal in Parramatta's fourth Grand Final victory, reversing the 1984 result with a 4‚Äì2 win over Canterbury-Bankstown to send the retiring Mick Cronin and team captain Ray Price out as premiership winners. 1986 also saw the Parramatta with their own home ground for the first time since over-excited fans had burned down the old Cumberland Oval grandstand during the 1981 Grand Final celebrations. Between 1982 and 1985 the club was forced to play home games at Canterbury-Bankstown's home ground, the Belmore Sports Ground, but in 1986 the new Parramatta Stadium was opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Sterling set about making the venue his own personal playground. During the year he was also part of the NSW Team which swept Qld 3‚Äì0 in the State of Origin series (the first time in series history a team had won all three games), winning man of the match in Game 2 at the SCG. After regaining his test place in the successful two test series against New Zealand, Sterling was an automatic selection for his second Kangaroo tour at the end of the season, this time going away as the undisputed number one halfback with 1985 test halfback Des Hasler. Sterling won The Rothman's medal in 1987 and 1990 but only featured in one match of The 1991 season after suffering a shoulder injury. Sterling returned to the field in 1992, but his shoulder was injured again after being hit in a hard tackle by Western Suburbs player David Gillespie. This would prove to be Sterling's final game as he retired due to being unable to recover from the recurring shoulder problem.https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/parramatta/end- of-an-era-as-eels-bid-farewell-to-parramatta-stadium/news- story/d02542b281c516e5c6b09066666390c6 Post-playing career Sterling lives on the Central Coast with his wife, Selina, and 18-year-old daughter, Hannah and 21-year-old son James. His hobbies include golf and the breeding of thoroughbreds. Sterling supports Liverpool F.C. in the Premier League. =Television / Radio career= Sterling's sharp intelligence marked him as an astute analyst of the game with the former Eel commentating for the Nine Network after initially starting in the media with Western Sydney radio station 2WS and Channel 10 where he was a sideline commentator for their coverage of the 1987 NSWRL finals. His autobiography, 'Sterlo! The Story of a Champion' was released in 1989. He later went on to host The Sunday Footy Show, anchoring the program from the show's inception in 1993 until the end of the 2015 season with Sterling replaced by Yvonne Sampson from the 2016 season. Sterling was also co-host of Nine's The NRL Footy Show from 1994‚Äì2006 alongside Paul Vautin. He made a guest appearance in 2007 on the first episode for the year to say farewell to the show before coming back for a short stint in 2010 as alternating host. He currently hosts Nine's 'Thursday Night Football' and is a member of their commentary team, he also rotates the hosting of 'Sunday Afternoon Football' with Yvonne Sampson. Sterling joined Triple M in March 2010 as an expert commentator on Monday Night Football and is an occasional panellist on Dead Set Legends and The Rush Hour. In March 2013, Sterling began hosting a weekly NRL show on Fox Sports called 'Sterlo; airing on Thursday nights. His show was axed in 2014 due to poor ratings competing with The Footy Show. He now hosts On the Couch with Sterlo which airs on Tuesday every week. =Rugby League awards= Since retiring from playing the game, Sterling has won several awards. In 1995, Sterling was picked at halfback in a poll to judge the best Australian team since the introduction of the limited-tackle rule in 1967. He won eight of fourteen votes, with the remainder going to Billy Smith, Ricky Stuart and Allan Langer. In 2000 Sterling was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. He was also inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in that year. In 2006, he was one of six past players to be inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame at the Dally M. Awards 2006 award ceremony.Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame In February 2008, Sterling was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.

The station operates at 92.1 MHz with an ERP of 16 watts, and is licensed to Pittsburgh. Its transmitter is located on the top of the university's Cathedral of Learning in Pittsburgh.  History  WPTS-FM originally evolved from WPGH, an AM carrier current station that broadcast to the Pitt Student Union and dormitories. WPGH was started in the fall of 1957 by 12 students, including Adrian Cronauer, whose experiences in Vietnam were made famous by Robin Williams in the movie Good Morning, Vietnam. Since then, WPGH is now the call letters of the Fox TV station in Pittsburgh. The push to get an FM station began in the fall of 1977 when Pitt requested a space on the commercial FM broadcast band. Because the Federal Communications Commission was concerned that the move of WPTS to FM might set an unfavorable precedent for other non-commercial stations seeking to make a similar move, Pitt had to reassure the FCC that WPTS-FM was a unique case. As a result, WPTS-FM was granted a class D license with a radiating power of 10 Watts in the fall of 1984, the last 10-Watt station to be licensed by the FCC. The station was originally at 98.5 until 1994, when it moved to the current frequency. After a brief reduction in power in parts of 2005 and 2006 at the request of the FCC, WPTS acquired a new directional antenna in the summer of 2006 to reduce interference with a commercial station in the north-west. The new antenna increased the range of the station in almost all directions. In 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2015 WPTS was nominated as one of the five to ten finalists for the mtvU Woodie Award for best college radio station in the United States. WPTS was awarded the Woodie Award in 2015.  Promotions  WPTS-FM has conducted a variety of successful and award-winning promotions. The \\"Moustache Challenge\\" was a group collaborative effort created by a number of WPTS-FM station staff in 2006 with the idea to see who might grow the most impressive moustache over the month of November. The idea is based on Jay Della Valle's The Glorious Mustache Challenge and the competition was open to anyone at the University of Pittsburgh. The promotion won the 2007 College Broadcasters, Inc. National Student Production Award for \\"Best Station Promotion\\". This contest followed the 2005 \\"Egg Hunt\\" contest, which won the 2006 College Broadcasters, Inc. National Student Production Award for \\"Best Station Promotion\\". As part of its promotional efforts, WPTS-FM typically hosts a national touring band in both the fall and spring. Past bands that have played at WPTS-FM include Nirvana, Matt & Kim, Mates of State, Man Man, Cloud Nothings, No Age, Of Montreal, Jens Lekman, Girl Talk, Why?, Real Estate, Woods, Waxahatchee, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, and many others.

The Private Committee was operational from June 1801 until late 1803. It comprised the closest associates of the tsar (the so-called \\"young friends\\"), including Count Pavel Stroganov, Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, Counts Viktor Kochubey and Nikolay Novosiltsev. Mikhail Speransky took an active part in the Committee, although he wasn't a formal member. The Private Committee was a place for discussing many governmental undertakings, such as the Senate reform, establishment of ministries in 1802, and others. The committee paid much attention to the peasant issues and prepared a few edicts with regards to this, such as decrees on allowing merchants and petty bourgeois (–º–µ—â–∞–Ω–µ, or meshchane) to acquire land (1801), on free bread ploughmen (–≤–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Ö–ª–µ–±–æ–ø–∞—à—Ü—ã, or volniye khlebopashtsy) (1803), and others.

The estimated age of Afropithecus is between 16 and 18 million years old, which was determined with radiometric dating techniques and the geological studies conducted by Broschetto and Brown from the University of Utah. In total there are 46 recovered specimens from Kalodirr relating to Afropithecus consisting of cranial, mandible, dentition and post-cranial remains. The type specimen of Afropithecus turkanensis is KNM-WK 16999. Morphology Richard Leakey and Meave Leakey first described Afropithecus turkanensis to be a large hominoid which appeared to have relatively thick enamel. Leakey suggested that A. turkanensis shared postcranial features with the species Proconsul nyanzae, which is the best known Miocene genus with literally hundreds of fossils having been found representing almost all skeletal elements, and sharing cranial features with Aegyptopithecus zeuxis and Heliopithecus which had two weathered molars that indicated a general distinction from known large early catarrhines, and later concluded that A. turkanenensis was a primitive, arboreal quadruped similar to P. nyanzae, and that A. turkanensis had primitive facial morphology and derived dental characteristics that would suggest a diet of hard fruits. Leakey also synonymised Heliopithecus with Afropithecus. =Cranial morphology= The type specimen, KNM-WT 16999 is composed of a long distinct snout, the facial skeleton, frontal, much of the coronal structure, most of the sphenoid, and relatively unworn adult dentition; the right orbit (virtually complete), the right zygomatic, the pterygoid, most of the sphenoid and lesser wings, the maxilla and premaxilla, and adult dentition with procumbent incisors. The surface on the right side maxilla and premaxilla along with the enamel on the right molars has been lost over time and has been replaced with calcite crystals, which only provide the general shape and not the details. From dentition it is known that the palate, which is almost completely calcified, of A. turkanensis is shallow, long and narrow with tooth rows that converge posteriorly, and it is probable the tooth rows were originally nearly parallel. A. turkanensis had a 6.5mm diastema between its very procumbent second incisor (KNM-WT 16999 had large, broad incisors) and the canine. The thickness of the enamel on the molars is often reported when fossils are being recorded and used to make comparisons across taxa. The thickness is referred to either as \\"thin\\" or \\"thick\\" and is commonly assessed as a linear measurement of the enamel on worn or naturally fractured teeth. From enamel testing it has been suggested that A. turkanensis is the oldest known thick- enamelled hominoid, which is what would distinguish it from Kenyapithecus. =Post-cranial morphology= Post cranial remains such as KNM-WK 16901, includes an associated right fibula (lacking the proximal portion, and is approximately the same size as Pan troglodytes; 184 mm), a right proximal third metatarsal, a right fourth metatarsal lacking the head, and an incomplete first metatarsal head. Other post-cranial remains include: KNM-WK 17016P a large right ulna, and foot or hand bones: KNM-WK 17008, KNM-WK 18395. Feeding Morphological analysis of the teeth and palate of Afropithecus suggests that it utilized a sclerocarpic foraging diet similar to members of Pitheciidae, in contrast to that of Morotopithecus.

The station, owned by the Fairchild Radio service, airs Chinese language programming. CHKT's studios are located on East Beaver Creek Road in Richmond Hill, while its transmitters are located on the Toronto Islands. It was best known under the call letters CKEY from 1945 to 1991.https://www.blogto.com/city/2013/10/that_time_when_ckey590_was_toronto_am_gold/ History Announcer Mickey Lester at CKEY in 1955 The station that was the indirect forerunner of CHKT first aired in 1925 as AM 840 CKCL, owned by the Dominion Battery Company. As with many radio stations in the early years of radio broadcasting, the station changed frequencies a number of times in its first years of operation. It settled on the permanent 580 kilohertz (then kilocycles) frequency in 1931. In 1945, the station was sold to Jack Kent Cooke's Toronto Broadcasting Co., and adopted the callsign CKEY. It was subsequently acquired by Shoreacres Broadcasting, a consortium that included Westinghouse and The Globe and Mail, in 1961, and changed its frequency to 590 in 1964 as CKWW signed on at 580 that year in Windsor and CKAR, (known today as CFBK-FM), in Huntsville had to change its frequency from 590 to 630 kHz. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, CKEY was the leading Top 40 music competitor to 1050 CHUM; one of its DJs was later CFNY staple David Marsden, known as Dave Mickie at CKEY (and later at CHUM as well). Another notable broadcaster was Bryan Fustukian, broadcasting as Vik Armen. The station dropped its Top 40 format for \\"middle of the road\\" music in 1965, now going up against CFRB, and was successful in that arena for a time. Shoreacres, in turn, was acquired by Maclean-Hunter in 1966. A transmitter for CKEY was once located on Midland Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East in Scarborough. This site was sold to the Scarborough Board of Education in 1964 to build Tabor Park Vocational School for the area‚Äôs redevelopment. From 1970 to 1984, CKEY featured Charles Templeton and Pierre Berton on the commentary show Dialogue with Templeton also reading the morning news for several years. The station also had Stephen Lewis as a commentator in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Final CKEY logoCKEY Key 590 logoOn January 1, 1984, CKEY flipped from its long running MOR format to soft rock/oldies as \\"Solid Gold CKEY\\", and on June 20, 1988, the station became \\"Key 590\\" with a full-blown oldies format, once again competing directly with a re-formatted CHUM. At 7 p.m. on March 14, 1991, CKEY signed off and began stunting with a heartbeat; the following morning at 9, the station adopted a country music format, changing its callsign to CKYC. The CKEY callsign was subsequently picked up by a station in Fort Erie. After Rogers Communications acquired Maclean-Hunter in 1994, CKYC was sold to Telemedia. Telemedia subsequently swapped CKYC's frequency with that of its sports outlet CJCL. On February 6, 1995, at 10 AM, CKYC ceased airing country music, and after stunting with a ticking clock for two hours, CJCL and CKYC swapped frequencies. CKYC subsequently aired only syndicated programming until it went off the air permanently in late 1996. CHKT was launched by Fairchild Group in 1997, over the 1430 AM frequency that had been occupied by CKYC immediately prior to its signing off for the last time. The CKYC callsign was subsequently picked up by a station in Owen Sound, Ontario in 2001. Original Fairchild Radio logo, used until 2012. In October 2019, Fairchild Radio gained public attention when it fired a Toronto radio talk-show host allegedly because of his questions during an interview perceived as critical of the Chinese government's stance on the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. Programming CHKT airs mainly Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin) language programming as well as programming in the following languages: Cambodian, Filipino, German, Hindi, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Laotian, Macedonian, Punjabi, Russian, Thai, Urdu and Vietnamese.

WJPA is an oldies simulcast on both the AM and FM bands. It serves Washington County, Pennsylvania, and can be heard in parts of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. The stations, which are owned by Washington Broadcasting Company, operate at 1450 kHz with a transmitter power output of 1 kW-Unlimited on the AM band and at 95.3 MHz with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 2.15 kW on the FM band. Both stations are licensed to Washington, Pennsylvania. Though, in general, broadcast focuses on oldies, WJPA is also known for its wide sports coverage. WJPA regularly broadcasts games of the Washington & Jefferson College football team, minor league baseball team, the Washington Wild Things, area high school wrestling matches and area high school basketball. History WJPA was started by a consortium of business owners in downtown Washington, several of whom are still part of the ownership group. WJPA made its debut on February 1, 1941. It was one of the last stations the FCC permitted to go on the air prior to the United States' entry into World War II. WJPA-FM also made its debut around this time, but broadcast at a frequency of 104.3 Mc. Because there were few FM receivers and even fewer car radios capable of receiving FM signals, the FM failed to make any kind of financial inroads and its license was returned to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. After FM radio started gaining momentum, Washington Broadcasting Company decided to give FM radio another try. The company applied for an FM license, and was granted the application to operate on 95.3 FM. WJPA-FM returned to the air on September 1, 1964. In the summer of 1979, after years of afternoon office-music broadcasts, WJPA-FM switched to a new, album rock-format and changed its call letters to WYTK-FM. In 1983, WYTK moved to a contemporary country format, billing itself as \\"K-Country\\". Again an automated station, this format remained until the early 1990s when ownership decided to reclaim the AM's call letters and simulcast the two stations, billing it as \\"The New Sound of Oldies\\", referring to the addition of then-new CD technology and a deeper music library than Pittsburgh-based competitor WWSW. This format continues today. WJPA breaks for separate programming occasionally, such as Sunday morning church broadcasts, high school sports, Pittsburgh Steelers football and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball. WJPA today The WJPA broadcast facilities are located at the corner of Main St. and East Wheeling St. across from the Observer-Reporter newspaper offices. Both stations transmit from a self-supporting tower at the intersection of Interstates 70 and 79, just north of Washington. WJPA has a reputation for its tenured on-air staff. Pete \\"I Got The Beat\\" Povich (personally nicknamed by The Go-Go's lead singer Belinda Carlisle) is the longest tenured DJ at WJPA, having worked there since 1983. Margie Konstantine, who met Pete while students at California University of Pennsylvania, joined the following year. Sports Director Bob Gregg has been part of the stations for more than three decades. Michael Siegel has served as President and General Manager for the past twenty (20) years.

This approach to language was one of the first projects of cognitive linguistics. In this system, grammar is not a formal system operating independently of meaning. Rather, grammar is itself meaningful and inextricable from semantics. Construction grammar is a similar foci of cognitive approaches to grammar. While cognitive grammar emphasizes the study of the cognitive principles that give rise to linguistic organization, construction grammar aims to provide a more descriptively and formally detailed account of the linguistic units that comprise a particular language. Langacker first explicates the system of cognitive grammar in his seminal, two-volume work Foundations of Cognitive Grammar. Volume one is titled \\"Theoretical Prerequisites\\", and it explores Langacker's hypothesis that grammar may be deconstructed into patterns that come together in order to represent concepts. This volume concentrates on the broad scope of language especially in terms of the relationship between grammar and semantics. Volume two is titled \\"Descriptive Application\\", as it moves beyond the first volume to elaborate on the ways in which Langacker's previously described theories may be applied. Langacker invites his reader to utilize the tools presented in Foundations first volume in a wide range of, mainly English, grammatical situations.  Theory  Cognitive grammar is unorthodox with respect to generative grammars and American structuralism. It primarily diverges from Chomskyan tradition through its assertion that grammar and language are integral and essential parts of cognition, not merely autonomous processes in the brain. Langacker argues not only that cognitive grammar is natural by virtue of its psychological plausibility, but also that it offers conceptual unification and theoretical austerity. It considers the basic units of language to be symbols (i.e. conventional pairings of a semantic structure with a phonological label). Grammar consists of constraints on how these units can be combined to generate larger phrases. The semantic aspects of cognitive grammar are modeled as image schemas rather than propositions, although these schema are only demonstrative, and are not intended to reflect any actual visual operation occurring during the production and perception of language. A consequence of the interrelation between semantic structure and phonological label is that each can invoke the other.

Burroughs. First published in 1973, it was the last major work Burroughs wrote during his self-imposed exile in Europe during the late 1960s and early 1970s. One of Burroughs' shorter novels, the book utilizes characters from numerous earlier works, and also introduces characters that would re-appear later in the Burroughs canon. Described as an \\"erotic fantasy\\", the novel (as explained by Burroughs scholar Jenny Skerl) consists of several plotlines shuffled together, with the \\"main\\" plot loosely dealing with a group of wild boys that seek to rewrite history by travelling through time to various times and places. Burroughs spent the rest of the decade writing shorter works and essays. His following novel was Cities of the Red Night, published in 1981. The same year Port of Saints was released, Burroughs also published the short story collection Exterminator! and several chapbooks. A revised edition of the novel was published in 1980.

It originated from the BBS flagship station, Toronto's CFTO-TV. Hosted by Dini Petty, the program mixed lifestyle features and interviews with celebrity guests. Petty, a host and broadcaster based in Toronto, left the CITY-TV talk show CityLine to headline the show in 1989. Directed by Randy Gulliver, the show reflected popular culture in Canada in the 1990s, featuring interviews with celebrities, actors, authors, singers and performers, as well as politicians, policy advocates and local celebrities. The show underwent a re- development in late 1994. In 1999, Dini Petty agreed to only shoot \\"tops and tails\\" to introduce repackaged retrospective segments of previous episodes to be aired instead of new material.  Awards  The show was nominated for several Can Pro and Gemini Awards in 1992, 1997 and 1998.  Notable episodes  The show received a NATPE (National Association of Television Program Executives) International Iris Award in 1992 for an hour-long interview with comedian Red Skelton. Petty also received a Can-Pro Award in 1997 for a one- hour interview with Sarah, Duchess of York.  Reoccurring guests  Broadcaster Dan Duran was a frequent co-host on the show throughout the 1990s.  Cancellation  Petty's contract with CTV ended in 2000, which led to a legal agreement resulting in Petty being awarded the original broadcast tapes to The Dini Petty Show. She donated the tapes to the Clara Thomas Archives & Special Collections at York University in 2010.

The station, which is owned by the Butler County Radio Network, operates at 97.7 MHz with an ERP of 4.6 kw and is licensed to Butler, Pennsylvania. BeginningsAs WISR-FM= WLER-FM's beginnings, like most FM's, were rather humble. The station began as WISR-FM, when the AM license had been issued for those same call letters when the license was first granted in 1941. The ownership at that time, Butler Broadcasting Company, chose to turn the license back to the FCC after having the FM license failed to make any kind of an impact financially. =As WBUT-FM= However, the license was recovered years later by WISR's AM crosstown competitor, WBUT, returning to the air in 1959. The station operated as WBUT-FM for many years until the late 1970s, when the call letters were changed to WLER-FM, and the station began to originate more of its own separate programming, though much of it was done through voice-tracked automation on a 10-inch reel tape-based automation system constructed by owners Bob and Ron Brandon. The station was an adult contemporary formatted station for much of its existence, using music and personalities provided by Concept Productions, based in Roseville, California. The procedure of voice-tracking was a relatively new concept at the time, before becoming standard practice in the late 1990s. The presentation of the voice-tracked announcers led many to believe that Steve Tyler, Dave Ware, and Terry Nelson were all on-site. The station simulcast from 6 to 8am during morning drive and during the last three hours of the day before signing off at 10pm. =As WLER-FM and format changes to hot adult contemporary & adult contemporary= WLER saw its biggest change in the spring of 2006, when the WBUT simulcast ended and the station began to take on a more Adult CHR (Top 40)-oriented approach. Where its two AM affiliate stations tend to serve Butler County, WLER gravitates more towards the suburbs north of Pittsburgh, as well as surrounding communities such as Grove City, Franklin, Mercer, Kittanning, and New Kensington. Since the flip of WLTJ to adult top 40, WLER-FM returned to its adult contemporary format, being the only station in Pittsburgh similar to its WSHH rival, but becoming similar to Kansas City's KZPT in terms of sound.

Early life He was born to an old family of the local nobility of Loreto Aprutino (province of Pescara), and was educated in Pisa, graduating in agricultural sciences from the University of Pisa in 1912. Acerbo's affiliation with the Freemasons (which he presumably abandoned upon the ban on masonic membership imposed by Mussolini in 1923) led him to become an advocate of irredentism and Italy's entry to World War I. When war exploded upon the continent, he volunteered for military service. By the end of the war, he was decorated with three silver medals for military valor and promoted to the rank of captain. Acerbo resumed his work as an assistant professor in the faculty of economics, and planned for a university career. At the same time, he promoted the Association of Servicemen of Teramo and Chieti (l'Associazione dei combattenti di Teramo e Chieti), which broke away from the national association after the election of 1919 and became the Provincial Combat Group (il Fascio di combattimento provinciale). Fascism Elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 1921 with the \\"national bloc\\", he acted as a mediator between local conservative forces and the Blackshirts; on a national level, Acerbo ensured peace in the open conflict between the Italian Socialist Party and Fascists, and was elected to a leadership position inside the National Fascist Party (PNF). During the March on Rome, Acerbo presided the Chamber as the coup d'√©tat unfolded, and acted as the link between the PNF and King Victor Emmanuel III. He then accompanied Mussolini as he was designated Prime Minister, and became his undersecretary. He made the Acerbo Law pass in November 1923; he was again deputy in 1924, winning his nobiliary title. Acerbo was marginally involved in the inquiry over Giacomo Matteotti's killing, and left his position in the government. In 1924 he instituted the Coppa Acerbo in memory of his brother Tito Acerbo (a war hero). Giacomo Acerbo was elected vice-president of the Chamber in 1926, and was Agriculture and Forestry Minister from 1929, dedicating himself to projects for universally-extended drainage. Together with Gabriele D'Annunzio, he contributed to the creation of Pescara Province in January 1927. Acerbo became head of the Economics and Commerce Faculty at the University of Rome in 1934, and, from 1935 to 1943, president of the International Agricultural Institute. A member of the Grand Council of Fascism, he was a spokesman for the project that turned the Chamber into a representative of Fasci and Corporazioni. When World War II began and Italy joined the Nazi German offensive, Acerbo served as member of the Italian Army General Staff during the marginal Italian maneuver in the Battle of France, and the Greek campaign. He was also Minister of Finance from February 1943. The split with Mussolini and later life Being a staunch and ardent Mediterraneanist, Acerbo first became outwardly critical of Mussolini when Mussolini began, at least in public, to embrace Nazi Nordicist theories and policies. Acerbo was critical of Nazi Nordicism, as Nazi Nordicism inherently classified Italians and other Mediterranean people as inferior or degenerate to Nordic and Germanic people. With the rise of pro-Nordicist Nazi Germany, and as Fascist Italy allied closer with Nazi Germany, the Fascist regime gave Italian Nordicists prominent positions in the National Fascist Party (PNF), which aggravated the original Mediterraneanists in the party, like Acerbo. In 1941, the PNF's Mediterraneanists, led by Acerbo, put forward a comprehensive definition of the Italian race as primarily Mediterranean. The Mediterraneanists were derailed by Mussolini's endorsement of Nordicist figures with the appointment of Nordicist Alberto Luchini as head of Italy's Racial Office in May 1941, as well as with Mussolini becoming interested with Evola's spiritual Nordicism in late 1941. Acerbo and the Mediterraneanists in his High Council on Demography and Race sought to return Italian Fascism to Mediterraneanism by denouncing the pro- Nordicist Manifesto of the Racial Scientists. On July 25 1943, Acerbo sided with Dino Grandi when the latter attempted to topple Mussolini and take Italy out of the war. He voted in favor of the motion (Ordine del giorno Grandi) that stripped Il Duce of his powers, and took refuge in his home region, the Allied-occupied Abruzzo - after Mussolini regained some standing with help from the Nazis, establishing the Italian Social Republic, one that proscribed all opponents (including Acerbo) during the Verona trial. Captured by the Resistance, Acerbo was sentenced to death by the High Court of Justice, a verdict lessened to 48 years in prison. This sentence too was overturned, and Acerbo's name was cleared in 1951, enabling him to resume his teaching career. He received numerous distinctions and titles in academia, and was awarded a gold medal (in Education, Culture, and Arts) by President Antonio Segni. In the elections of 1953 and 1958, Acerbo was an unsuccessful candidate of the Monarchist National Party to the Italian Parliament. Acerbo died in Rome in 1969. He is also remembered for his passion as a collector of ancient pottery, and created a Gallery dedicated to ceramics of the Abruzzo.

The objects are drawn to scale, and their data points are at the black dots in the middle. Atmospheric escape is the loss of planetary atmospheric gases to outer space. A number of different mechanisms can be responsible for atmospheric escape; these processes can be divided into thermal escape, non-thermal (or suprathermal) escape, and impact erosion. The relative importance of each loss process depends on the planet's escape velocity, its atmosphere composition, and its distance from its sun. Escape occurs when molecular kinetic energy overcomes gravitational energy; in other words, a molecule can escape when it is moving faster than the escape velocity of its planet. Categorizing the rate of atmospheric escape in exoplanets is necessary to determining whether an atmosphere persists, and so the exoplanet's habitability and likelihood of life.  Thermal escape mechanisms  Thermal escape occurs if the molecular velocity due to thermal energy is sufficiently high. Thermal escape happens at all scales, from the molecular level (Jeans escape) to bulk atmospheric outflow (hydrodynamic escape). A visualization of Jeans escape. Temperature defines a range of molecular energy. Above the exobase, molecules with enough energy escape, while in the lower atmosphere, molecules are trapped by collisions with other molecules. = Jeans escape = One classical thermal escape mechanism is Jeans escape,David C. Catling and Kevin J. Zahnle, The Planetary Air Leak, Scientific American, May 2009, p. 26 (accessed 25 July 2012) named after British astronomer Sir James Jeans, who first described this process of atmospheric loss.Muriel Gargaud, Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Volume 3, Springer Science & Business Media, May 26, 2011, p. 879. In a quantity of gas, the average velocity of any one molecule is measured by the gas's temperature, but the velocities of individual molecules change as they collide with one another, gaining and losing kinetic energy. The variation in kinetic energy among the molecules is described by the Maxwell distribution. The kinetic energy (E_{kin}), mass (m), and velocity (v) of a molecule are related by E_{\\\\mathit{kin}}=\\\\frac{1}{2}mv^2. Individual molecules in the high tail of the distribution (where a few particles have much higher speeds than the average) may reach escape velocity and leave the atmosphere, provided they can escape before undergoing another collision; this happens predominantly in the exosphere, where the mean free path is comparable in length to the pressure scale height. The number of particles able to escape depends on the molecular concentration at the exobase, which is limited by diffusion through the thermosphere. Three factors strongly contribute to the relative importance of Jeans escape: mass of the molecule, escape velocity of the planet, and heating of the upper atmosphere by radiation from the parent star. Heavier molecules are less likely to escape because they move slower than lighter molecules at the same temperature. This is why hydrogen escapes from an atmosphere more easily than carbon dioxide. Second, a planet with a larger mass tends to have more gravity, so the escape velocity tends to be greater, and fewer particles will gain the energy required to escape. This is why the gas giant planets still retain significant amounts of hydrogen, which escape more readily from Earth's atmosphere. Finally, the distance a planet orbits from a star also plays a part; a close planet has a hotter atmosphere, with higher velocities and hence, a greater likelihood of escape. A distant body has a cooler atmosphere, with lower velocities, and less chance of escape. A visualization of hydrodynamic escape. At some level in the atmosphere, the bulk gas will be heated and begin to expand. As the gas expands, it accelerates and escapes the atmosphere. In this process, lighter, faster molecules drag heavier, slower molecules out of the atmosphere. = Hydrodynamic escape = An atmosphere with high pressure and temperature can also undergo hydrodynamic escape. In this case, a large amount of thermal energy, usually through extreme ultraviolet radiation, is absorbed by the atmosphere. As molecules are heated, they expand upwards and are further accelerated until they reach escape velocity. In this process, lighter molecules can drag heavier molecules with them through collisions as a larger quantity of gas escapes. Hydrodynamic escape has been observed for exoplanets close to their host star, including the hot Jupiter HD 209458b.  Non-thermal (suprathermal) escape  Escape can also occur due to non-thermal interactions. Most of these processes occur due to photochemistry or charged particle (ion) interactions. = Photochemical escape = In the upper atmosphere, high energy ultraviolet photons can react more readily with molecules. Photodissociation can break a molecule into smaller components and provide enough energy for those components to escape. Photoionization produces ions, which can get trapped in the planet's magnetosphere or undergo dissociative recombination. In the first case, these ions may undergo escape mechanisms described below. In the second case, the ion recombines with an electron, releases energy, and can escape. = Sputtering escape = Excess kinetic energy from the solar wind can impart sufficient energy to eject atmospheric particles, similar to sputtering from a solid surface. This type of interaction is more pronounced in the absence of a planetary magnetosphere, as the electrically charged solar wind is deflected by magnetic fields, which mitigates the loss of atmosphere. The fast ion captures an electron from a slow neutral in a charge exchange collision. The new, fast neutral can escape the atmosphere, and the new, slow ion is trapped on magnetic field lines. = Charge exchange escape = Ions in the solar wind or magnetosphere can charge exchange with molecules in the upper atmosphere. A fast-moving ion can capture the electron from a slow atmospheric neutral, creating a fast neutral and a slow ion. The slow ion is trapped on the magnetic field lines, but the fast neutral can escape. = Polar wind escape = Atmospheric molecules can also escape from the polar regions on a planet with a magnetosphere, due to the polar wind. Near the poles of a magnetosphere, the magnetic field lines are open, allowing a pathway for ions in the atmosphere to exhaust into space. Atmospheric escape from impact erosion is concentrated in a cone (red dash-dotted line) centered at the impact site. The angle of this cone increases with impact energy to eject a maximum of all the atmosphere above a tangent plane (orange dotted line).  Impact erosion  The impact of a large meteoroid can lead to the loss of atmosphere. If a collision is sufficiently energetic, it is possible for ejecta, including atmospheric molecules, to reach escape velocity. In order to have a significant effect on atmospheric escape, the radius of the impacting body must be larger than the scale height. The projectile can impart momentum, and thereby facilitate escape of the atmosphere, in three main ways: (a) the meteoroid heats and accelerates the gas it encounters as it travels through the atmosphere, (b) solid ejecta from the impact crater heat atmospheric particles through drag as they are ejected, and (c) the impact creates vapor which expands away from the surface. In the first case, the heated gas can escape in a manner similar to hydrodynamic escape, albeit on a more localized scale. Most of the escape from impact erosion occurs due to the third case. The maximum atmosphere that can be ejected is above a plane tangent to the impact site.  Dominant atmospheric escape and loss processes in the Solar System  Earth = Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen. The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller. A Japanese research team in 2017 found evidence of a small number of oxygen ions on the moon that came from the Earth. In 1 billion years, the Sun will be 10% brighter than it is now, making it hot enough for Earth to lose enough hydrogen to space to cause it to lose all of its water (See Future of Earth#Loss of oceans). = Venus = Recent models indicate that hydrogen escape on Venus is almost entirely due to suprathermal mechanisms, primarily photochemical reactions and charge exchange with the solar wind. Oxygen escape is dominated by charge exchange and sputtering escape. Venus Express measured the effect of coronal mass ejections on the rate of atmospheric escape of Venus, and researchers found a factor of 1.9 increase in escape rate during periods of increased coronal mass ejections compared with calmer space weather. = Mars = Primordial Mars also suffered from the cumulative effects of multiple small impact erosion events, and recent observations with MAVEN suggest that 66% of the 36Ar in the Martian atmosphere has been lost over the last 4 billion years due to suprathermal escape, and the amount of CO2 lost over the same time period is around 0.5 bar or more. The MAVEN mission has also explored the current rate of atmospheric escape of Mars. Jeans escape plays an important role in the continued escape of hydrogen on Mars, contributing to a loss rate that varies between 160 - 1800 g/s. Oxygen loss is dominated by suprathermal methods: photochemical (~ 1300 g/s), charge exchange (~ 130 g/s), and sputtering (~ 80 g/s) escape combine for a total loss rate of ~ 1500 g/s. Other heavy atoms, such as carbon and nitrogen, are primarily lost due to photochemical reactions and interactions with the solar wind. = Titan and Io = Saturn's moon Titan and Jupiter's moon Io have atmospheres and are subject to atmospheric loss processes. They have no magnetic fields of their own, but orbit planets with powerful magnetic fields, which protects these moons from the solar wind when its orbit is within the bow shock. However Titan spends roughly half of its transit time outside of the bow-shock, subjected to unimpeded solar winds. The kinetic energy gained from pick-up and sputtering associated with the solar winds increases thermal escape throughout the transit of Titan, causing neutral hydrogen to escape. The escaped hydrogen maintains an orbit following in the wake of Titan, creating a neutral hydrogen torus around Saturn. Io, in its transit around Jupiter, encounters a plasma cloud. Interaction with the plasma cloud induces sputtering, kicking off sodium particles. The interaction produces a stationary banana-shaped charged sodium cloud along a part of the orbit of Io.  Observations of exoplanet atmospheric escape  Studies of exoplanets have measured atmospheric escape as a means of determining atmospheric composition and habitability. The most common method is Lyman-alpha line absorption. Much as exoplanets are discovered using the dimming of a distant star's brightness (transit), looking specifically at wavelengths corresponding to hydrogen absorption describes the amount of hydrogen present in a sphere around the exoplanet. This method indicates that the hot Jupiters HD209458b and HD189733b and Hot Neptune GJ436b are experiencing significant atmospheric escape.  Other atmospheric loss mechanisms  Sequestration is not a form of escape from the planet, but a loss of molecules from the atmosphere and into the planet. It occurs on Earth when water vapor condenses to form rain or glacial ice, when carbon dioxide is sequestered in sediments or cycled through the oceans, or when rocks are oxidized (for example, by increasing the oxidation states of ferric rocks from Fe2+ to Fe3+). Gases can also be sequestered by adsorption, where fine particles in the regolith capture gas which adheres to the surface particles.  References  Further reading  * *Ingersoll, Andrew P. (2013).

He was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1959 World Series as the Dodgers won their first championship since relocating from Brooklyn just two years earlier. Early life Sherry was born in Los Angeles, California, and was Jewish.Larry Sherry Stats Baseball-Reference.com He was born with clubfeet, for which he needed surgery as an infant and wore special shoes. He attended Fairfax High School in Los Angeles. Baseball career From Los Angeles, Sherry made his debut with his hometown Dodgers on April 17, ‚Äì just their third game after moving west. Adding to the pressure, the game was played on the road against their hated rivals, the San Francisco Giants, who had also relocated from New York City. Sherry had a brief outing, facing four batters without recording an out, and appeared in only four more games all year. But he returned with a solid season in , winning 7 games with only two losses, with an earned run average of 2.19. He was named MVP of the 1959 World Series, in which the Dodgers defeated the Chicago White Sox in 6 games, and also received the Babe Ruth Award. Sherry completed all four Dodger victories during the Series, winning two of them and saving the two others, and had a 0.71 ERA in innings. In he won a career-high 14 games, finished 38 games (4th in the league), pitched in 57 games (6th in the league), and even received support for MVP, coming in 20th in the voting. Sherry in 1961 In 1961 he was 5th in the NL in saves (15) and games finished (34), and 9th in games pitched (53). In 1962 he was 7th in saves (11) and games pitched (58). Sherry and his brother Norm, a Dodgers catcher from 1959 to 1962, became the first all-Jewish battery in major league history. He was traded to the Tigers for Lou Johnson and cash just before the season, and spent three and a half years with his new club, earning a career- best 20 saves in 1966, 3rd-best in the AL. He was traded to the Houston Astros for Jim Landis for the second half of the 1967 season, and ended his career with three games for the California Angels in . Sherry retired with a record of 53‚Äì44, 606 strikeouts, 82 saves and a 3.67 ERA in 416 games and innings. Through 2010, he was 5th all-time in career games (directly behind Dave Roberts), 8th in strikeouts (directly behind Barney Pelty), and 9th in wins (directly behind Barry Latman) among Jewish major league baseball players. Coaching career Sherry later coached in the Dodgers' minor league organization. He was a Pittsburgh Pirates coach in 1977 and 1978, and a member of the California Angels coaching staff in 1979 and 1980.

The city is from Enna in the hill country between the Rivers Ditta√¨no and Salso. The economy is mostly based on agriculture. There are caves for sulphur and salt mineral, and water springs. Thermal baths Villa at Panneria History Thucydides mentions Kentoripa (ŒöŒµŒΩœÑ·ΩÄœÅŒπœÄŒ±) as a city of the Sicels, hellenized in the 5th century BC. It became an ally of the Athenians at the time of their expedition against Syracuse, and maintained its independence almost uninterruptedly (though it fell under the power of Agathocles) until the First Punic War when it immediately submitted to the Romans. It was thus granted Latin Rights before the rest of Sicily and was a civitas immunis ac libera sine foedere (free city exempted from tax). In the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC Centuripe Ware was a distinctive class of Sicilian vase painting, with the unusual feature of fully coloured painting in tempera applied after firing was complete. Cicero described it, perhaps with some exaggeration, as being by far the largest and richest city of Sicily, and as having a population of 10,000, engaged in the cultivation of an extensive territory. It appears to have suffered much in the war against Sextus Pompeius because of its loyalty to Octavian, but Octavian reconstructed and gave the inhabitants Roman citizenship. The Imperial Roman age has left the most impressive monumental remains. Grandiose monumental ruins, a rich complex of sculptures, numerous inscriptions: a whole series of elements seem to mark the accomplishments of a local family that, in the 2nd century, came to express a consul, a son of one of the components of the entourage of the emperor Hadrian. A large number of monumental remains were lost forever due to the neglect of the past and systematic theft and plundering for collectors and collections of every where. It gradually declined in the late Empire. Emperor Frederick II entirely destroyed the city in 1233 in punishment for its rebellion, the inhabitants deported to Augusta. King Charles I of Anjou razed it completely to the ground, and the city was rebuilt only in 1548 by Francesco Moncada. The city was known as Centorbi until 1863. In 1943 during World War II and the liberation of Sicily the Battle of Centuripe saw the town captured spectacularly from the defending Germans by the 38th (Irish) Infantry Brigade although it suffered some damage. Centuripe Ware Lekanis, Hetjens-Museum, D√ºsseldorf Main sights Many remains of the ancient city, mostly of the Roman period, still exist and numerous antiquities, including some fine Hellenistic terra-cottas, have been discovered in casual excavations.

The strategic position of the city allowed the control both of this road and of that from the North continuing towards Leontini. The discovery of a paved stretch of road along the Simeto river and some ruined sections of the destroyed bridge, forgotten for centuries due to a deviation of the river, have advanced the hypothesis of finding the via frumentaria to some scholars. The bridge is located near the Ponte Barca of Biancavilla and consists of four large segments aligned in the WNW/ESE direction, of a width of about 3 m and a length of 6‚Äì8 m each. The monument dates from the second century, probably linked to Quintus Pompeius Sosius Falco, curator of the viae Traianae between 108 and 112.

It was the first government town to be established north of the state capital, Adelaide. Port Wakefield is situated from the Adelaide city centre on the Port Wakefield Highway section of the A1 National Highway. Port Wakefield is a major stop on the Adelaide ‚Äì Yorke Peninsula and Adelaide ‚Äì Port Augusta road routes. Travellers between Adelaide and any of the Flinders Ranges, Yorke Peninsula, Eyre Peninsula or the Nullarbor Plain will likely travel through Port Wakefield. Due to its strategic location, Port Wakefield is known for its roadhouses and trucking stops. Just north of the township there is a major forked intersection where the Yorke Peninsula traffic diverges west onto the Copper Coast Highway from the main Augusta Highway. The intersection is notorious for road accidents and traffic delays, especially at the end of holidays and long weekends. History The town was originally named Port Henry by William Hill. The name of the town was, around 1849, changed to Port Wakefield, after the Wakefield River. In 1848, the Patent Copper Company agreed to build and operate a smelter at Burra. Seeking to reduce cartage costs, a track was surveyed to its port established at the mouth of the River Wakefield. By securing leases of the appropriate Crown Land, the company obtained a monopoly of the port. The Government declared the track the Great Western Road. The wharf was constructed along the bank of the river and cargo was transferred between the wharf and ships at anchor in the Gulf on lighters. With the opening of the railway from Adelaide to Gawler in 1857, the Copper Company's traffic came to a sudden end, leaving only pastoral produce to flow to the port. Mixed farming was established on lands opening up by the Government along the River in the mid-1860s and this called for improvement in transport to the Port. William Hanson, Manager for Railways, selected a route for a horse-drawn tramway terminating at Hoyles Plains, later renamed Hoyleton. The enabling Act provided for a tramway of 28 miles 41 chains (45.9 km) in length to a gauge of , the first line in South Australia built to that gauge. Subsequently, the Government agreed that the line should be operated by a private body. The successful tenderer was one Paul Badcock who opened the line to traffic on 4 January 1870. Horses were worked in three relays between the stations on the route. The choice of gauge was influenced by the argument that costs varied with the cube of the gauge. As this railway had its own port, it was not expected to link up with any broad gauge railways which avoided of course any break of gauge problems. Following a surrender of the lease, the line was taken over by the Government at the end of 1870. On 1 March 1876 the line was extended from Hoyleton to Blyth. Steam locomotives were subsequently obtained and, by August, 1876, the entire line was being worked by steam power. The line was extended at the other end from Port Wakefield to Kadina on 9 October 1878. In 1927, these railways, and the remainder of the Western system that grew from them, were converted to the broad gauge. The Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1868 by a local stonemason and carpenter. It continues in use as a Uniting Church. The 1955 Australian Grand Prix was held at the Port Wakefield Circuit east of the township. The circuit opened in 1953 when public road racing was banned, and closed in 1961 when some of its facilities were moved to the longer Mallala Race Circuit. =2020 highway upgrade= A proposal by the Liberal Party of Australia before the 2018 state election was that if it was elected it would build a single lane overpass at the Augusta Highway end of the Copper Coast Highway to reduce traffic conflicts. The party won the election and upgraded the planning to completely grade-separate the intersection and duplicate the highway through Port Wakefield. The contract for detailed design and construction of duplication of Port Wakefield Road through Port Wakefield and grade-separate the intersection with the Copper Coast Highway was let in March 2020 to the \\"Port Wakefield to Port Augusta Alliance\\", a consortium of CPB Contractors, Aurecon and GHD Group. This consortium is also responsible for the duplication of Joy Baluch AM Bridge in Port Augusta. Both projects are expected to be completed in 2022. Media In 1876, a short lived newspaper was printed in the town, called the Port Wakefield Times and Balaclava, Hoyleton, Blyth and Lochiel Advertiser (July - August 1876) and published by Edward Richardson. A later newspaper was the Wakefield Sun (15 July 1910 ‚Äì 31 May 1912). Another publication, the Port Wakefield Monitor (7 January 1915 - 26 June 1941), was also published locally. Local government On 28 November 1878 the District Council of Port Wakefield was established on the same day as the District Council of Clinton and District Council of Kulpara, bringing local government to the area.

In earlier times (and especially on the \\"name\\" trains), a lounge car was more likely to have a small kitchen, or grill and a limited menu. Food was prepared to order and often cooked, though items such as club sandwiches would have usually been part of the offerings. The cars were often operated by the Pullman Company, and in other cases by the railroad directly as part of the dining car department (on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway the Fred Harvey Company manned the food concession). Lounge cars operated by Pullman were exclusively for the use of sleeping car passengers, while those operated by the railroad were available to coach as well as first-class travelers. Buffet lounge cars were often found in trains which did not offer full dining car service. On other trains they supplemented the diner and offered sandwiches, burgers and short orders at times when the diner was not serving; e.g. mid-afternoon and late night. To qualify as a buffet lounge the car had to offer both food and drink service.

Beawar was the financial capital of Merwara state of Rajputana. As of 2011, the population of Beawar is 342,935. It is located southwest of the state capital Jaipur, amidst Aravali hills. The city used to be a major center for trade, especially in raw cotton, and used to have cotton presses and the Krishna cotton mills. Currently, major industries include mineral-based units, machine-based units, machine tools and accessories, pre-stressed concrete pipes, plastic products, textiles, wooden furniture and asbestos cement pipes. Beawar is the largest producer of cement in northern India and home to Shree Cement. It is situated in a mineral-rich region having reserves of feldspar, quartz, asbestos, soapstone, magnesite, calcite, limestone, mica, emerald, granite, and masonry stone. Reserves of barytes, fluorite, wollastonite and vermiculite have also been found. Nearest airports are Jodhpur (145 km) and Jaipur (190 km).

It also has railway connectivity with Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmadabad, Bangalore (bi-weekly), Haridwar, Dehradun (weekly), Bareilly and Kolkata. History alt= Beawar was founded by Colonel George Dickson (1795-1857) in 1836. Beawar was part of India and the administrative headquarters of Merwara district. Since the ancient days, the region where Beawar lies is known as Magra-Merwaran, and it was named after a local village called \\"Beawar Khas\\" by the Rajasthani. This region was ruled by fierce tribes such as the Chauhan Rajput (descendants of Prithviraj Chauhan). The British tried to subdue them but were unsuccessful because the people were scattered across many small villages. Moreover, the Chauhan ruled through Shyamgarh Fort and were excellent in conducting war. The Battle of Shyamgarh was fought between the Chauhan Rajputs and the British. The British won and Chauhans abandoned the fort of Shyamgarh, but employed guerrilla tactics causing great loss to the British. Consequently, the British founded a military cantonment with fortified walls for protection and engaged in further military missions. Another factor in building the cantonment here was Beawar's location at the strategic tri-junction of the royal states of Jaipur, Jodhpur, and Udaipur and near to the royal state of Ajmer. Beawar the name of the city comes from the name \\"Be Aware\\" which was originally a sign given to the city by a British Emperor. Chauhan Rajput, the great warriors known for their courage, were a major problem to the British Empire, so they decided to form a cantonment and hence Beawar as Nayashahar came into existence. Beawar is the birthplace of classical mathematician Duncan Sommerville.

With just over 5,000 inhabitants, Cochem falls just behind Kusel, in the Kusel district, as Germany's second smallest district seat. Since 7 June 2009, it has belonged to the Verbandsgemeinde of Cochem. GeographyLocation= Cochem in 1646 Cochem with Imperial castle in 1919 Dedication of the \\"Skagerrak Bridge\\" on 23 January 1927 Cochem lies at an elevation of some 83 m above sea level and the municipal area measures 21.2 km2.Facts and figures The town centre with the outlying centre of Sehl upstream lies on the Moselle's left bank, while the constituent centre of Cond lies on its right. A further constituent centre, Brauheck, with its commercial area, air force barracks and new town development, lies in the heights of the Eifel on Bundesstra√üe 259, some from the town centre. Emptying into the Moselle in Cochem are the Kraklebach, the Ebernacher Bach, the Sehlerbach, the Falzbach, the M√§rtscheltbach and the Enthetbach. History As early as Celtic and Roman times, Cochem was settled. In 886, it had its first documentary mention as Villa cuchema. Other names yielded by history are Cuhckeme and Chuckeme in 893, Cochemo in 1051, Chuchumo in 1056, Kuchema in 1130, Cuchemo in 1136, Cocheme in 1144, then Cuchme, and into the 18th century Cochheim or Cocheim. Cochem was an Imperial estate. It was pledged by King Adolf of Nassau in 1294 to the Archbishopric of Trier and remained Electoral- Trier territory until the French occupation began in 1794. In 1332, Cochem was granted town rights, and shortly thereafter, the town fortifications, which still stand today, were built. Between 1423 and 1425, the town was stricken with a Plague epidemic. In 1623, Elector Lothar von Metternich brought about the founding of a Capuchin monastery. In the Thirty Years' War, the town was besieged, but not conquered. In 1689, King Louis XIV's troops first burnt the Winneburg (castle) down and then conquered the town of Cochem with its castle. Reconstruction was long and drawn out. Beginning in 1794, Cochem lay under French rule. In 1815, it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Louis Fr√©deric Jacques Raven√© bought the ruin of the former Imperial castle in 1866 and began its reconstruction. Only after a bridge was built across the Moselle at Cochem in 1927 were the two fishing villages of Cond and Sehl amalgamated with the town in the course of administrative reform in 1932. This bridge, called the \\"Skagerrak Bridge\\", was dedicated on 23 January 1927. In the Second World War, great parts of Cochem's old town were destroyed. Also during the war, the operations staff of the underground subcamp of ZeisigTeam-delta.info of the Natzweiler concentration camp between the villages of Bruttig and Treis was located here. At its height, 13,000 people were imprisoned. They provided slave labour for Bosch, which made spark plugs, ignition systems, and glow plugs, which were important to the German war effort, under brutal conditions.Edward Victor.

The town of Cochem and its castle were held by the Archbishops of Trier beginning in 1298. They also granted Cochem town rights in 1332. The charges in the town's arms are thus purely references to its long history with the Electorate of Trier. The red cross on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is Trier's old armorial bearing, and the keys on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side are Saint Peter's attribute, thus representing Trier's patron. This composition appeared in the earliest known town seal, from the early 15th century, which likely dates from a bit earlier, the late 14th century.Description and explanation of Cochem's arms =Town partnerships= Cochem fosters partnerships with the following places:Town partnerships * Avallon, Yonne, France since 1966 * Malmedy, Li√®ge, Belgium since 1975 * Moritzburg, Mei√üen, Saxony since 1990 * Yizhou District, Hechi, China since 2017 =Political development= After both the town council and the Verbandsgemeinde council approved the motion on 23 October 2008, the until then Verbandsgemeinde-free town of Cochem became part of the Verbandsgemeinde of Cochem-Land on 7 June 2009. In connection with this, the state government also enacted a law on 18 February 2009 that deals with, among other things, the transfer of ownership of certain properties from the town to the Verbandsgemeinde.Landesgesetz zum freiwilligen Zusammenschluss der verbandsfreien Stadt Cochem und der Verbandsgemeinde Cochem-Land vom 18. Februar 2009 The Verbandsgemeinde also changed its name with the amalgamation of Cochem, becoming the Verbandsgemeinde of Cochem.

There is also a promenade along the Moselle. Further points of interest are the historic Senfm√ºhle (\\"Mustard Mill\\") and the water gauge house on the Moselle. More detailed information about the castles and some of the ecclesiastical buildings mentioned above follows. Cochem Imperial castle Reichsburg Cochem Vineyards at the Reichsburg Cochem An inner court of the Reichsburg Cochem The Reichsburg Cochem had its first documentary mention in 1130. In 1151, it was occupied by King Konrad III, who declared it an Imperial castle. In 1688, the castle was overrun by French King Louis XIV's troops in the course of the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), and the following year, they destroyed it. The castle complex long lay in ruins before in 1868 it was bought by the Berlin businessman Louis Fr√©deric Jacques Raven√© for 300 Goldmark and then reconstructed in the Gothic Revival style. Since 1978 it has been owned by the town of Cochem and is administered by a company named Reichsburg GmbH. Winneburg castle ruin The Winneburg was built in the latter half of the 13th century. It had its first documentary mention in 1304 as belonging to a one Wirich von Wunnenberg. In the centuries that followed, the castle complex was steadily expanded while all the while remaining within the ownership of the Lords of Wunnenberg (later Winneburg). After this noble family died out in 1637, the castle passed to the family Metternich. In 1689, during the Nine Years' War, the castle was besieged, taken and blown up by French troops. It was never restored, and remains in ruins to this day. It was, however, bought in 1832 by Prince von Metternich, but no reconstruction ever came about. Since 1932, it has been owned by the town of Cochem. Saint Roch's Plague Chapel The Pestkapelle St. Rochus, also known as the Peterskapelle seems to have had its groundwork laid in the time when Archbishop Otto von Ziegenhain waived Cochem's customary taxes and levies for ten years on the occasion of the Plague. It is described in an engraving by Braun and Hogenberg as S. Pettersberg. Standing next to a small, rectangular chapel was a hostel. It is also possible that the red sandstone keystone set above the west portal comes from this time. Despite heavy weathering, a high relief of a Madonna sitting on clouds, with Child, framed with a Zweipass, can be made out. In 1666, the Plague came once again to Cochem. This might well have been the reason why Philipp Emmerich von Winneburg and Dietrich Adolf von Metternich endowed a new building for the parish in 1680. With this new building, the Plague saint, Roch, came to the fore as the chapel's namesake. The wooden altar from 1682 shows the two men's coat of arms. A notice on the back names Michael Luter for a new setting in 1820. The central altar image is a glorification of Mary that sweeps over the representatives of the spiritual (pope, abbots, members of orders, priests) and worldly (emperors, kings, bishops) estates. Seen above her is the Holy Trinity with the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and beside her are Death with the hourglass, and an angel with banners bearing doxologies and quotations from psalms. A cartouche above the central altar shows Saint \\"Anthony with Child\\". On the uppermost part of the altar, on an open gable, is Saint Peter with a key and a book. Originally, the chapel's ornamentation included images of Mary Magdalene, Saint Roch, Saint Sebastian, the holy bishop Nicholas and another statue of Roch. Saint Roch's dog was even depicted in the middle of the ceiling in a half-relief. Among the chapel's adornments was once a chandelier, which has since been stolen. It was a wall fixture in the shape of an arm dressed with a short sleeve. Sehler Dom St. Antonius Abbas Sehler Dom St. Antonius Abbas In 1493, the parish of Cochem was granted leave to build a new chapel in Sehl on the bank of the Moselle. There had already been a chapel in Sehl, but its whereabouts are now unknown. Financing for the new chapel was made possible by Pope Alexander VI's and Archbishop of Trier Johann II of Baden's (1456‚Äì1503) indulgence privileges. Of this chapel, the quire still stands today, filled out by the west portal built in 1915. The chapel was consecrated for God's worship to the holy abbot and local resident Antonius, the holy bishop Wolfgang (depictions of whom are to be found used as keystones together with Archbishop Johann's coat of arms), the Madonna, the holy bishop Ruprecht and the holy virgin Cunen. Each Tuesday and Thursday, a Mass was to be said in the chapel by the Cochem pastor, for which the chapel would yearly receive 6 Gulden and 24 Wei√üpfennig in Cochem currency. For that, the hay from Sehl's meadows, bordering on the chapel, was pledged. Sehlers were \\"half-townsmen\\" of Cochem without their own municipal rights, and thus Cochem town council at first spoke out against the move to bring a bell to the so-called Sehler Dom (\\"Sehl Cathedral\\"). Nevertheless, the chapel later got one that was poured in 1441. It bears the inscription \\"AVE MARIA GRACIA PLENA DOMINUS TECUM MCCCCXXXXI\\" (\\"Hail Mary, full of grace ‚Äì the Lord [is] with thee ‚Äì 1441\\"). Found here today is a \\"Mary under the Cross\\" from the early 16th century, a gift from Dean Eckert to Saint Martin's. Chapel at the Three Crosses On an open spot between Cochem and Sehl in the traditional cadastral area known as Im Haag at some crags, the Kapelle Zu den drei Kreuzen (\\"Chapel at the Three Crosses\\") offers an impressive view into the Moselle valley. The building of the first chapel on this spot may well stem, like the Crucifixion group that stands before it, from an endowment made in 1652 in Elector of Trier Karl Casper von der Leyen's time. There is a corresponding year in soft sandstone mounted in the middle of the otherwise basalt cross. Two tau crosses, today lacking the former thief figures that once hung on them, still flank the middle cross. Carved into the left one are the master's initials, P.A. In the mid 19th century, the first chapel had fallen into such disrepair that then master builder Joseph Dalmar Senior's advice was sought. The chapel's condition, however, made any renovation impossible. So, Dalmar instead put forth a plan for a new building, along with a cost estimate. It was financed through donations from the Cochem townsfolk themselves. Besides the many small ones, there was also a big one of more than ten Thaler. To raise more monies to defray the building costs for the new chapel, a raffle was held. Offered as a prize was a pair of slippers, which was won by Captain Sabel. This raffle yielded a further ten Thaler, making it possible to complete the new chapel by 1850. Dalmar planned it to be built three metres farther back into the slope. The land needed for this was donated by the family Bauer. There were further expenses, such as those for roof boards and slates. The \\"Throne of Mercy\\" (Gnadenstuhl in German) from the 16th century that was originally found here now stands in the \\"Old Quire\\" at Saint Martin's. Saint Remaclus's Parish Church Anyone seeing Saint Remaclus's in the outlying centre of Cond for the first time might be surprised at how recently it was built (1964‚Äì1967). The plain, clear and also mighty shape, the slate quarrystones used in its building that are so typical of local construction and the way the church fits so well among its neighbours at the foot of the steep vineyards would lead many visitors to believe that its building date must lie quite far back in history. According to the plan conceived by master churchbuilder Emil Steffann (1899‚Äì1968), the building was meant to serve as a bridgehead and a counterpoint to the castle over on the other side of the river. The execution of this work, which was simple yet marked by great quality, stands out quite strongly within the church. Saint Remaclus's stands as an exemplary conception in modern church building. It incorporates above all openness: for the liturgical implementation after the Second Vatican Council, and for the congregation around the altar. The cross- shaped space is surrounded by whitewashed brick walls, punctuated by great round windows. Mighty circular arches expand on the cross's three upper arms from the pews to the altar position before the deep-set apse. A huge wheel- shaped chandelier spreads over the pews and the chancel. The ornamentation has been consciously reduced to a few very valuable, restored images and figures from the old, and now demolished, parish church, and to conservatively wrought artworks by contemporary artists: foundation stone and keystone in the crypt's barrel vaulting by Jochem Pechau, the tabernacle in the crypt by Klaus Balke, the forged grille by Paul Nagel, the lead glass window in the apse by Jakob Schwarzkopf and the ambo, the eternal flame and the altar candleholder by Christoph Anders. The church is opened at all service times.  Bundesbank- Bunker Cochem  In 1962, Deutsche Bundesbank built a secret bunker in Cochem-Cond, 30 meters underground, disguised by two houses of the training and recreation center of Bundesbank. The bunker's vault held a reserve series of German mark banknotes totaling 15 billion marks during the Cold War, intended to enter circulation in case the Eastern Bloc would try to cripple West German economy by massively counterfeiting the existing DM banknotes. To open the vault, bank officials from Frankfurt would have to bring over three different keys and a lock combination.

Above the Imperial castle is found the Lescherlinde, a limetree which, owing to its great age of more than 550 years ‚Äì it can even be clearly recognized up on the mountain from Cochem railway station ‚Äì holds the status of Natural Monument. Above the outlying centre of Cond lies the Brauselay Nature Conservation Area, which has Mediterranean vegetation. Not far from Cochem, down the Moselle from the village of Klotten, is found the Dortebachtal Nature Conservation Area, a place well worth a hike for its scenery. Economy and infrastructure The town of Cochem is characterized by winegrowing and tourism, even if their economic importance has been waning over the past few decades. Important tourism sites are the Reichsburg Cochem (Cochem Imperial castle), the Freizeitzentrum Cochem (leisure centre) in the outlying centre of Cond, the nearby Wild- und Freizeitpark Klotten (\\"Klotten Wilderness and Leisure Park\\") and the Ediger-Eller holiday and golf resort up in the Eifel heights. A majority of the inhabitants, though, can now be found employed in other branches of the economy. There are fewer than ten full-time winegrowing businesses. =Transport= Cochem Railway Station is of importance to architectural history The town lies on the Koblenz‚ÄìTrier line, which between Cochem and Ediger-Eller runs through the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Tunnel, which from its completion in 1877 until 1887 was Germany's longest tunnel at . Calling at the station are Regionalbahn, Regional-Express and InterCity trains, along with one ICE train each morning and evening affording a morning-evening link with Berlin. Moreover, there are a few regional buslines. The town belongs to the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Mosel (\\"Rhine-Moselle Transport Association\\"). =Public institutions= The town is a Bundeswehr location (TUK Cochem-Brauheck) and an administrative and educational centre. Cochem is the administrative seat of the Verbandsgemeinde of Cochem and the Cochem-Zell district. Located in Cochem are an Amt court, an employment office, a branch office of the Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt Koblenz-Mosel (\\"Koblenz-Moselle Water and Ship Transport Office\\"), a health unit, the district waterworks, a police station and the water safety police station, a hospital, two seniors' residences, a home for those with mental handicaps (at Ebernach Monastery), a German Red Cross and Wasserwacht rescue station and a well equipped fire brigade. =Education= Cochemer Platt (local dialect) * Grundschule Cochem (primary school) * Hauptschule Cochem * Realschule Cochem * Martin-von-Cochem-Gymnasium * Berufsbildende Schule Cochem-Zell (vocational college) ** Berufsvorbereitungsjahr gewerblich-technischen sowie hauswirtschaftlichen Bereich (preparatory year in commercial-technical and budgetary fields) ** Berufsschule (professional school with 30 subject areas) ** Berufsfachschule I (BF I) (technical school I with 7 subject areas) ** Berufsfachschule II (BF II) (technical school II) ** Zweij√§hrige H√∂here Berufsfachschule (two-year higher technical school) ** Berufsoberschule I (BOS I) (upper professional school I) ** Duale Berufsoberschule (DBOS) (dual upper professional school) ** Berufsoberschule II (BOS II) (upper professional school II) ** Fachschule (school for geriatric nursing and tourism) * Kreisvolkshochschule (KVHS) Cochem/Zell (district folk high school) =Clubs= * Aktive Cochemer Jugend (ACJ, youth) * Brauhecker Boule Club (BBC, boules) * Behindertensportgruppe Fortuna Ebernach (disabled sports) * Caritasverband f√ºr die Region Mosel- Eifel-Hunsr√ºck e.

His early reign was dominated by struggles with his rival relatives over control of the western Persian provinces, but by 998 he managed to establish his supremacy over the Buyid confederation. His reign nevertheless saw the increasing encroachment of neighbouring powers on Buyid territory, and marks the beginning of the decline of the Buyids' power. He was the third son of 'Adud al-Dawla.  Early life  In 986, a Dailamite officer named Asfar ibn Kurdawayh rebelled against the ruler of Iraq, Samsam al-Dawla, and changed his allegiance to Sharaf al-Dawla. However, Asfar quickly changed his mind, and declared allegiance to the latter's other brother Abu Nasr Firuz Kharshadh, who was shortly given the honorific epithet of \\"Baha' al-Dawla.\\" However, Samsam al-Dawla, with the aid of Fuladh ibn Manadhar, suppressed the rebellion, and imprisoned Baha al-Dawla. Samsam al-Dawla shortly made peace with Sharaf al-Dawla, and agreed to release Baha al-Dawla. Sharaf al-Dawla shortly betrayed Samsam al-Dawla, conquered Iraq, and had him imprisoned in a fortress.  Reign  Upon the death of Sharaf al-Dawla in 988, Baha' al-Dawla succeeded him, whereupon he took the additional title of Diya' al-Milla. Samsam al-Dawla, who managed to flee from prison, prevented Baha' al-Dawla from gaining all of Sharaf al-Dawla's possessions by taking control of Fars, Kerman and Khuzestan. Both Baha' al-Dawla and Samsam al-Dawla, however, were threatened by their granduncle Fakhr al-Dawla, the ruler of Jibal, who invaded Khuzestan in an attempt to drive a wedge between the two brothers' territories. This act prompted the brothers to draw up an alliance. Samsam al- Dawla recognized Baha' al-Dawla as the ruler of Iraq and Khuzestan, while he himself kept Arrajan, Fars and Kerman. Both promised to consider each other as equals, and took the title of king (malik). In 990, Baha' al-Dawla appointed Sabur ibn Ardashir as his vizier. In 991 Baha' al-Dawla attempted to gain supremacy over Samsam al-Dawla's realm. He took the ancient Persian title of Sh√¢hansh√¢h and invaded the latter's territory. His forces were defeated, however, and Samsam al-Dawla regained Khuzestan and even gained control of the Buyid territories in Oman. He then recognized Fakhr al-Dawla as senior amir, submitting to his authority. Fakhr al-Dawla's death in 997, coupled with Samsam al-Dawla's increasing troubles within his realm, provided Baha' al- Dawla with the opportunity to assert his authority in Persia. He gained the support of the Hasanwayhid ruler Badr ibn Hasanwayh and prepared for the expedition. The invasion began in December 998; scarcely had it commenced when Samsam al-Dawla was killed by one of the sons of 'Izz al-Dawla who had risen in revolt. Baha' al-Dawla then took Shiraz, defeated 'Izz al-Dawla's sons, and was joined by the Dailamites of Fars under Ibn Ustadh-Hurmuz. For the rest of his life Baha' al-Dawla remained in Fars. He also managed to gain indirect control over northern Iran, where Fakr al-Dawla's two sons Majd al-Dawla and Shams al-Dawla recognized him as senior amir by 1009 or 1010. In 1001, Baha' al-Dawla appointed Ibn Ustadh-Hurmuz as the governor of Ahvaz, and one year later, appointed him as the governor of Iraq, where he made order by solving disputes between different religious sects, and by defeating bandits who had caused chaos in the region. He also managed to defeat the former governor of Iraq, Abu Ja'far al-Hajjaj, who was supported by Kurds and Shayban Arabs. In 1007, Baha' al-Dawla made peace with the Al-Mazeedi ruler Ali ibn Mazyad, who was given the honorific title of \\"Sanad al-Dawla\\", and agreed to become a vassal of Baha' al-Dawla in return of recognition of his rule. This treaty was highly in favor of Baha' al-Dawla, who managed to use Ali ibn Mazyad as the keeper of Buyid influence in Iraq and its surrounding regions. In 1011, Ibn Ustadh-Hurmuz died and was succeeded by Baha' al-Dawla's new vizier Fakhr al- Mulk as the governor of Iraq. Baha' al-Dawla's reign coincided with the beginning of the decline of the Buyids. The Kurdish chief Badh laid the foundations for the Marwanid amirate in Diyarbakr, while the initially subservient 'Uqaylids of Mosul expanded into Iraq at the Buyids' expense. By the time Baha' al-Dawla died, Baghdad and Wasit were the only two major Iraqi cities directly under his control. In the north, where Fakhr al-Dawla's sons ruled, the Buyid frontier also fell back, as the Ziyarids of Gorgan and Tabaristan permanently wrested themselves from Buyid control. The Ghaznavids kept putting pressure on the Khurasan border, while the Kakuyids began to set up a state in Isfahan.  Death  For various reasons, Baha' al-Dawla did not actively defend the borders. Having gained undisputed control of the Buyid state, he seemed content to allow external enemies to seize territories in the west and north. He died in Arrajan in December 1012. Shortly before his death, he named his son Sultan al-Dawla as his successor.

The term was coined by the Dutch sociologist Sebald Rudolf Steinmetz in 1913. Sociography typically takes the form of loose commentary, although it may also be found as portions of novels that depict life in a given society. Much of the sociography currently in print focuses on society sub-groups, such as ethnic, neighborhood or occupational-geographic groupings. Conflict on scope of the field Some sociographers, such as Patrick Geddes, contend that sociography is more properly considered only as the limited combination of sociology and geography.John Clark, \\"A Social Ecology\\", (2000) It is unclear whether this would also apply where the sub-society under study is not geographically limited. Recent history Sociography has taken on increasing importance in recent years, as many authors have begun to speak out on issues of race and culture. Although their writing is done without benefit of academic study, it is still considered a valid explication of a given cultural regime. Within social science departments in many universities, sociography is now considered a meta-discipline, combining the study of literature, sociology, politics of culture, and economics.

History The American Jewish Congress (AJCongress) was founded in November 1918, and represented a \\"populist counterbalance to the American Jewish Committee (AJC), which was dominated by the wealthy and conservative German-Jewish establishment.\\" It has established a \\"reputation for being politically liberal.\\" It protested the Nazi regime. Post World War II, it made \\"its mark as an active litigant on church-state issues and civil rights\\". AJCongress Crippled by Madoff Scandal The jewish Daily Forward, 8 February 2009 It was first proposed in August 30, 1914 by Bernard G Richards. Leaders within American Jewish community, consisting of Jewish, Zionist, and immigrant community organizations, convened the first American Jewish Congress in Philadelphia's historic Independence Hall. Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, Felix Frankfurter, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, and others joined to lay the groundwork for a national democratic organization of Jewish leaders from all over the country, to rally for equal rights for all Americans regardless of race, religion, or national ancestry. In addition to its stated goal of equal rights for all, it was founded to broaden Jewish leadership and to present a unified American Jewish position at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. It became effective as a pressure group in 1928 under the leadership of Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise, who remained the President and chief spokesperson of the AJCongress until his death in 1949. The current head of the AJCongress is Jack Rosen. =The 1930s= Throughout the 1930s, Rabbi Wise was vocal in his warnings about the dangers of Nazism. When Adolf Hitler was named Chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Wise organized a mass protest rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. He did this despite strong opposition by the German government, the U.S. State Department, and conservative Jewish organizations such as the American Jewish Committee and B'nai B'rith. The American Jewish Congress continued to organize protest rallies throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In August 1933, the American Jewish Congress led a general boycott of German goods. In 1934, Daniel Marks was named head of the AJCongress. He traveled to Germany and brought 5,000 Jews to America. In 1936, the American Jewish Congress was instrumental in establishing the World Jewish Congress (WJC). Maintaining his position as President of the AJCongress, Rabbi Wise was also elected president of the WJC. During World War II, the AJCongress acted as a liaison between the U.S. government and the WJC on issues relating to rescue attempts made on behalf of European Jews. =The 1940s= In August 1942, Rabbi Wise received a cable from Gerhart Riegner, the WJC representative in Switzerland. Riegner reported that the Nazis had planned, and were implementing, a policy to exterminate all of European Jewry; the cable also referred specifically to the Auschwitz- Birkenau concentration camp. After the U.S. State Department confirmed the accuracy of the information in the cable, now known as the Riegner Telegram, the AJCongress convened a Joint Emergency Committee. The committee sought to coordinate the major Jewish organizations in the United States to lobby the Roosevelt administration to take increased measures rescuing European Jews. In December 1942, the American Jewish Congress established a Planning Committee, which sought support for a variety of rescue proposals. The committee was never more than marginally successful in mobilizing American public support for rescue efforts. The most impressive of these projects was another rally at Madison Square Garden. Held on March 1, 1943, the rally drew a crowd of 70,000. Similar rallies were subsequently held in a number of cities throughout the United States. In August 1943, Rabbi Wise met Jan Karski. The American Jewish Congress was pro-Zionist in its platform. Its leadership overlapped with that of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA). As a result, the two organizations agreed to concentrate on different tasks during the war. The American Jewish Congress dedicated itself to rescuing European Jews, while the ZOA worked to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. This arrangement continued after the war, although its significance decreased after the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. The AJCongress was a pioneer in the struggle for Soviet Jewry long before it became a popular movement. Domestically, the AJCongress became active as well. It was the first Jewish organization to use law and legislation to protect the rights of American Jews, at a time when other Jewish organizations were using appeals to goodwill to achieve this objective. =The 1960s and 1970s= Rabbi Joachim Prinz (1902‚Äì88) was President of the AJCongress from 1958 to 1966. He served as a founding chairman of the 1963 March on Washington and spoke at that event. The AJCongress was involved in legal proceedings that sometimes conflicted with other Jewish American organizations. In 1966, the AJCongress joined the New York Civil Liberties Union, the United Parents Associations, and the United Federation of Teachers in filing suit against provisions of the Federal Education Act, which would provide support to religious schools. Jewish day school educators and leaders in over 30 states and over 100 communities representing 330 Hebrew day schools insisted that the American Jewish Congress did not speak for American Jews on religious or educational issues, and was viewed by some in the Jewish community as primarily a secular agency. The President of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America (also known as the Orthodox Union), Rabbi Joseph Karasick, said that the American Jewish Congress ‚Äúspeaks for itself only and is under no circumstances to be taken as representing the American Jewish community. The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, central spokesman for this country‚Äôs 3,100 Orthodox synagogues, as well as all Orthodox rabbinic bodies and every other Orthodox Jewish body, have given full support to the Federal Education Act and deem its provisions to be consonant with the principle of church-state separation.‚ÄùOrthodox Groups to Defend in Court Federal Aid to Parochial Schools JTA, 5 December 1966 In late 1978 New York State's prison system reached an agreement, brokered in part by AJCongress's then-assistant executive director Marc D. Stern, \\"to arrange .. TV dinners .. along with packaged breakfasts and disposable utensils\\" to those requesting kosher food while in prison. Also in 1978, under the administration of the Cultural Council Foundation CETA Artists Project, AJC hired three photographers, Bill Aron, Arnold Cohen and Meryl Meisler to document Jewish life in all five boroughs. In addition to the photographers, puppeteers, calligraphers, actors, poets, dancers and klezmer musicians were employed. =The 1980s and 1990s= Following its heyday during the 1960s, when many of its activities coincided with the larger Civil Rights Movement, a drop-off in its membership throughout the 1980s and 1990s ensued. In the late 1990s and into the 2000s, the AJCongress experienced the defection of a number of local chapters, including those in Boston, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. There were disputes over ideological issues and finances. Some of those chapters have since reestablished themselves as independent non-profits focused on liberal social and community issues. Finding the AJCongress had become too conservative, members of the Los Angeles chapter, for instance, created the Progressive Jewish Alliance (PJA) in 1999. They sought to assert a Jewish interest in the campaigns for social justice in Southern California, which has the United States' second largest Jewish population. The Progressive Jewish Alliance expanded in February 2005 by opening a San Francisco Bay Area chapter. The AJCongress has since regrouped and is actively engaged in constitutional issues domestically and supporting Israel and challenging anti-Semitism abroad. =2000‚Äì2010= In 2004, the AJCongress led a successful effort to keep federal funds out of Catholic schools. U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler sided with the American Jewish Congress, which argued that federal funds were being used to pay for the teaching of Catholic values through programs such as the University of Notre Dame‚Äôs Alliance for Catholic Education. AmeriCorps argued that its funding was based on a program‚Äôs secular activities, not religious teachings. But Judge Kessler ruled that the religious and secular activities were not sufficiently separated or monitored.AmeriCorps sponsor must stop funding Catholic programs The First Amendment Center, 7 July 2004 The AJCongress suspended its activities and laid off much of its staff on July 13, 2010 because it had run out of operating funds due to losses in the Madoff scandal. It disclosed that it lost roughly $21 million of the $24 million in endowments it had invested through Bernard Madoff and his firm, money that supported the AJCongress and its programs. The endowments supported about one quarter of the AJCongress‚Äô budget, which was $6.2 million in 2006. The AJCongress had connected with Madoff through Martin and Lillian Steinberg, supporters of AJCongress and friends of Madoff who invested with him, and Madoff became a trusted advisor of AJCongress on financial matters. The AJCongress increased its investments with Madoff in 2004, after it sold its New York headquarters for $18 million in 2003, and when the Steinbergs died they left approximately $17 million to the organization, which was also invested with Madoff. While the financial losses of the endowment were crippling, others noted that the AJCongress had long been in the shadow of larger American Jewish organizations such as the American Jewish Committee (AJC) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). While the AJCongress focused on religious freedom in America, free speech, and women's rights, donors showed more interest in Israel and anti-Semitism.\\"AJCongress Crippled by Madoff Scandal\\" The Jewish Daily Forward, 8 January 2009 While the AJCongress had a long history of fighting aid to religious schools, the effort proved to be in conflict with Orthodox Jewish communities that were very successful in attracting government funds for students. An investigation by The Jewish Daily Forward showed that each year, tens of millions of dollars in federal Pell Grants go to yeshivas, which typically focus on Talmud study rather than secular subjects. For 2010, 63 of the 152 religious institutions that received Pell Grants were Jewish, the data shows. The Jewish schools received 53% of the $84.5 million in Pell Grant money that went to religious schools in 2010. Of the top 10 Pell Grant recipients in dollar terms in 2010, six were yeshivas.\\"Yeshivas Score Huge Pell Grant Windfall Jewish Religious Colleges Get Tens of Millions in Federal Aid\\" The Jewish Daily Forward, 31 October 2012 =2010‚Äìpresent= In 2012, the AJCongress spent 16.5% of its expenses on programs and services it delivered. It spent 71% on administrative expenses.American Jewish Congress Charity Navigator, accessed 15 April 2015 In 2013, the board restructured the organization; since then, it has been working on incorporating new missions that are relevant to the times. Today, the American Jewish Congress primarily focuses on the following challenges: strengthening the bond between the U.S. and Israel; combating domestic and global anti-Semitism; combating the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) Movement; preventing a nuclear Iran; and promoting cooperation and trade between Israel and countries around the world. Among its major programs are the International Mayors Conference, where the organization brings over 30 mayors from around the world to promote Israel back in their cities. Past participants include Mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio, President of Argentina Mauricio Macri, Premier of Taiwan William Lai, and former Prime Minister of Italy Matteo Renzi. Moreover, the organization successfully fights the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) Movement and believes that BDS is not a purely anti-Israel issue, but a human right issue. Moreover, in order to make decision makers more accessible to the Jewish community, the organization created the 500 Club and executive briefing meetings and conference calls with the decision makers and members of the Jewish community. The American Jewish Congress meets regularly with global leaders in order to promote the U.S.‚ÄìIsrael alliance. It is a leading organization in providing informative political tools for the Jewish community. In May 2019, the AJCongress launched the Jewish Guide to U.S Politics, a virtual resource summarizing the stances of U.S. Senators and candidates in the 2020 U.S. presidential race on issues related to the American Jewish community and Israel. The AJCongress also created the \\"Club 500\\", an executive speaking series which connects decision makers from around the world with members of the Jewish community via phone briefings. Past participants include U.S. Senator Ben Cardin, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, and former IDF Major General Yaakov Amidror. The First Amendment The American Jewish Congress has been involved in hundreds of civil rights and religious freedoms cases before local and federal courts and the United States Supreme Court. Brown v. Board of EducationBrown v. Board of Ed. gave the AJCongress its public entr√©e into the field of Constitutional defense agencies. The group advocates for removing religious symbols from public life, and thus filed a brief against allowing public displays of the menorah during Hanukkah in County of Allegheny v. ACLU. Charitable choice The AJCongress monitors issues like charitable choice proposals, in which federal funds are given to faith-based institutions to provide social services that are historically the responsibility of government. Women's issues The AJCongress was the first mainstream Jewish organization with a membership of both men and women to devote considerable time, effort, and resources to women's issues. The Women's Division, founded 1933, carried on these activities for approximately fifty years before it was discontinued as a separate section; the organization subsequently continued its support for women's rights and feminist perspectives under the auspices of the Commission for Women's Equality (CWE), which was established in 1984.Svonkin, Stuart. \\"American Jewish Congress.\\" Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 1 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive (jwa.org). Retrieved October 24, 2015. The CWE has turned its attention to the ethical, legal, and medical issues arising from research revealing that Ashkenazi Jewish women have higher-than-average frequencies of gene mutations predisposing them to breast and ovarian cancer. The 1996 conference, \\"Understanding the Genetics of Breast Cancer: Implications for Treatment, Policy and Advocacy,\\" organized by national CWE, has been duplicated by AJCongress regions nationwide. In 2000, CWE presented Cancer Genetics in the Ashkenazi Community, to explore medical breakthroughs since the first conference as well as new developments in genetic testing. This follow-up conference was distinctly more upbeat than its predecessor, both in terms of medical preventive measures and in regard to legislation to ensure privacy and eliminate discrimination based on testing. In 1988, AJCongress hosted \\"The First International Jewish Feminist Conference: The Empowerment of Women\\" in Israel to address women's rights. More than 600 Jewish women from around the world attended, including former Congresswoman Bella Abzug and Betty Friedan. Some of the attendees visited the Kotel, Torah in hand and found that they were not allowed to pray in their fashion because of Orthodox restrictions on women wearing religious items, singing or reading Torah. A movement began, now known around the world as Women of the Wall, headed by Anat Hoffman. Polls show that in Israel \\"64 percent of the secular public, 53 percent of the traditional non-religious public, and 26 percent of the traditional-religious public support the group, Women of the Wall, and their quest to pray at the Kotel in their fashion. But their cause was unanimously rejected by the poll‚Äôs ultra-Orthodox respondents,‚Äù according to The Algemeiner.AJCongress At the Wall‚Ä¶a History of Support for Women AJC, accessed 15 April 2015 The CWE most recently held a major women's conference in Tel Aviv, Israel in May 2006, bringing notable women of achievement like Anne F. Lewis; Lynn Sherr, anchor for ABC's 20/20; Irshad Manji, author of The Trouble with Islam; Bettina Plevan, Partner at Proskauer Rose LLP and former head of the New York Bar Association; and others to a weeklong discussion on women's accomplishment and success.AJCongress ReleaseCWE Article PDF Carole E. Handler was the CWE's most recent Chair. Interfaith The AJCongress has participated in interfaith dialogue with the U.S. Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs. ControversiesIsrael Singer= In the fall of 2007, the AJCongress announced that it had retained the services of Rabbi Israel Singer,JTA Wire, (by way of the Baltimore Jewish Times), AJC Taps Israel Singer, December 2, 2007 the former Secretary-General of the World Jewish Congress ‚Äì who left the agency after claims of financial irregularities were levied following an investigation by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and followed up by accusations from then-WJC President Edgar Bronfman about alleged theft. =Ms. Magazine= On January 10, 2008, the AJCongress released an official statement critical of Ms. magazine's refusal to accept a full page advertisement honoring three prominent Israeli women: Dorit Beinisch (then- President of the Supreme Court of Israel), Tzipi Livni (then-Minister of Foreign Affairs of Israel), and Dalia Itzik (then-Speaker of the Knesset). The AJCongress press release states: \\"...'What other conclusion can we reach,' asked Richard Gordon, President of AJCongress, 'except that the publishers ‚àí and if the publishers are right, a significant number of Ms. Magazine readers ‚àí are so hostile to Israel that they do not even want to see an ad that says something positive about Israel?'...'Clearly Ms. has changed a great deal from the days when AJCongress members and leaders of the AJCongress' Commission for Women‚Äôs Equality ‚àí including Betty Friedan, Bella Abzug and Ms. co-founder Letty Pogrebin ‚àí were at the forefront of the Women's Movement that led to the creation of Ms. Magazine.' Katherine Spillar, Executive Editor of Ms. magazine, responded to the AJCongress on Ms. magazine's website, denying an anti-Israel bias, stating that: \\"Ms. Magazine has been criticized for not running an ad submitted by the American Jewish Congress (AJCongress) featuring the photographs of three prominent Israeli women leaders with the statement 'This is Israel.'\\" She argued that the proposed advertisement was inconsistent with the magazine's policy to accept only 'mission-driven advertisements from primarily non-profit, non-partisan organizations', suggesting that the advertisement could have been perceived 'as favoring certain political parties within Israel over other parties, but also with its slogan ‚ÄúThis is Israel,‚Äù the ad implied that women in Israel hold equal positions of power with men.'[11] Spillar stated that the magazine had 'covered the Israeli feminist movement and women leaders in Israel ... eleven times' in its last four years of issues.[12] Religion and the public schools: A summary of the law American Jewish Congress, which had already been publishing \\"Religion and the Public Schools: A Summary of the Law\\" with the name of attorney Marc D. Stern on the cover, adapted it to a \\"looseleaf form and expanding its distribution\\" in 1993. Stern served as assistant executive director of AJCongress and subsequently became General Counsel of American Jewish Committee. Location of materials for research on the American Jewish Congress The Western Jewish History Center, of the Judah L. Magnes Museum, in Berkeley, California has a large collection of historical records and documents from the Northern California Division of AJCongress. Additionally, the American Jewish Historical Society has a large collection related to the American Jewish Congress. The American Jewish Historical Society (AJHS) has recently completed a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded project to process a new accretion of organizational records and create a finding aid for the additional records, photographs, and audio-visual material related to the American Jewish Congress and its Executive Directors, Commissions, and Public Relations department.
