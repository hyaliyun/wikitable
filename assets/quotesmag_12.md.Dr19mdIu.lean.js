Early life She was christened Carmen but called Mandy by her family. Her career tended to involve serious acting roles rather than comedy, even in her first small part in The Man in the White Suit, where she was a sad-faced little girl who helped Alec Guinness escape from his pursuers. She was a natural actress and put in a much praised performance in her second film, another Ealing production, Mandy (1952), playing a deaf-mute child whose parents (played by Terence Morgan and Phyllis Calvert) did not know how to cope with bringing her up. She was also convincing in the next film, Background (1953), along with the other two child actors in this film about a family breaking up because of an impending divorce. Like Mandy, this was a drama about a well-to-do middle- class family; Valerie Hobson played her mother. She also had lighter roles, such as in Raising a Riot (1955) starring Kenneth More. Some of her other famous co-stars were Joan Greenwood, Cecil Parker, Godfrey Tearle, Thora Hird and Sam Wanamaker. Miller also made two single records, familiar to British people of a certain age: \\"Snowflakes\\" and \\"Nellie the Elephant\\". She also appeared in television dramas, making films until she was 18. Personal life In 1962, at the age of 18, Miller moved to New York City to become an au pair. In 1965, she married Christopher Davey, an architect, and had three children (two girls and a boy). She lives in retirement in Britain. She is the aunt of actress Amanda Pays.

Originally such fungi were referred to the genus Corticium (\\"corticioid\\" means Corticium-like) and subsequently to the family Corticiaceae, but it is now known that all corticioid species are not necessarily closely related. The fact that they look similar is an example of convergent evolution. Since they are often studied as a group, it is convenient to retain the informal (non-taxonomic) name of \\"corticioid fungi\\" and this term is frequently used in research papersLarsson K-H, Larsson E, Koljalg U. (2004). High phylogenetic diversity among corticioid homobasidiomycetes. Mycological Research 108: 983–1002. and other texts. History The genus Corticium was established by Persoon in 1794 for fungi having smooth, effused fruit bodies. Corticium roseum Pers. was later selected as the type species.Donk MA. (1963). The generic names proposed for Hymenomycetes XIII. Taxon 12: 158-159. Subsequent authors described over 1000 species in the genus which continued to be used in its wide sense up until the 1950s. Though a number of genera had been recognized as distinct from Corticium from the late nineteenth century onwards, it was not until Swedish mycologist Prof. John Eriksson reviewed the corticioid fungi in a series of publications starting in 1950Valeros, N. 1950). Peniophora sect. Coloratae. UppsalaEriksson J. (1958). Studies in the Heterobasidiomycetes and Homobasidiomycetes-Aphyllophorales of Muddus National Park in Sweden. Uppsala. that modern concepts were formed. The eight-volume work that he initiated, Corticiaceae of North Europe (1973-1987), effectively established the current circumscription of the corticioid fungi. Eriksson and his co-authors, however, still placed all or most of these fungi within the Corticiaceae, though stating that this was \\"not a natural taxon but an assemblage of species with similar habitat.\\"Hjortstam K, Larsson K-H, Ryvarden L. (1987). The Corticiaceae of North Europe. Vol. 1. Oslo: Fungiflora It was not until the advent of DNA sequencing that the full diversity of these fungi was realized.Binder M. et al. (2005). The phylogenetic distribution of resupinate forms across the major clades of mushroom-forming fungi (Homobasidiomycetes). Systematics and Biodiversity 3: 113–157. The genus Corticium is still retained, but is now restricted to a few species closely related to the type. The Corticiaceae is now equally restricted to a few genera close to (and including) Corticium. Crust-like species are found in no less than 18 of the 24 currently recognized orders of higher basidiomycetes (Agaricomycotina).Hibbett D et al.

Description and diversity The corticioid fungus Hyphodontia sambuci, common on dead elder branches The corticioid fungus Stereum hirsutum, showing an effused fruit body with bracket-like outgrowths Corticioid fungi are rather loosely defined, but most have effused fruit bodies, the spore bearing surface typically being smooth to granular or spiny. Some species (in the genera Stereum and Steccherinum, for example) may form fruit bodies that are partly bracket- or shelf-like with a smooth to spiny undersurface. The corticioid fungi currently comprise around 1700 species worldwide, distributed amongst some 250 genera.Hjortstam K. (1998) A checklist to genera and species of corticioid fungi. Windahlia 23: 1–54. They constitute around 13% of the homobasidiomycetes known to date. Habitat and distribution Most corticioid fungi are wood-rotting species and rely on wood degradation as their primary means of nutrition. Although the fruiting bodies are formed on the underside of dead branches or logs, the fungus resides within the wood. A number of species are litter-rotting and produce fruitbodies underneath fallen leaves and compacted litter as well as on fallen wood. Some of these species are known to be ectomycorrhizal (forming a beneficial association with the roots of living trees). A few specialist species grow on dead herbaceous stems and leaves or on dead grass, rush, and sedge stems, especially in marshes. Parasites of plants and other fungi are also found in the group. Corticioid fungi have a worldwide distribution, but are obviously commonest in forest communities.

He played for the University of Michigan from 1918 to 1921. After graduating from Michigan in 1922, he attended law school at Northwestern University where he also served as the line coach for the university's football team from 1923 to 1925. He was also the line coach at Harvard University from 1926 to 1930 and at the University of Chicago in 1935. He was a state court judge in Illinois from 1931 to 1976 and served as the presiding judge of Chicago's probate court for his last 20 years on the bench. Early years Dunne was born in 1899 in River Forest, Illinois. His father, Edward F. Dunne, was the mayor of Chicago from 1905 to 1907 and Governor of Illinois from 1913 to 1917. While his father was serving as governor, the younger Dunne attended high school in Springfield, Illinois, where he was a star athlete in track and football. Michigan Dunne in 1919 Three of Dunne's older brothers were athletes at the University of Michigan. His brother Edward graduated from Michigan in 1909 and played first base on the Wolverines' baseball team. His brother Maurice graduated from Michigan's law school in 1917 and played for the Wolverines' baseball and football teams. His brother Dick also competed in athletics at Michigan. Dunne announced his decision to attend the University of Michigan in May 1916. While attending Michigan, Dunne won varsity letters in three sports—four in football, two in basketball, and three in track. He played at the center position for the Michigan basketball teams and also represented the University of Michigan and the United States as a competitor in the pentathlon at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. In football, Dunne started all five games for the undefeated 1918 Michigan team that was later recognized as the national championship team. As a sophomore in 1919, Dunne started six of seven games for Michigan at the tight end position. As a junior in 1920, Dunne was moved from end to guard and started all seven games as left guard for the 1920 team. At the end of the 1920 season, Dunne was elected as the captain of the 1921 Michigan football team. He started five of seven games for the Michigan team in 1921, all at the left guard position. At the end of the 1921 season, Dunne was selected as a first-team All-American by Norman E. Brown of the Central Press Association. Dunne also earned the Big Ten Conference Medal of Honor awarded to the student at each Big Ten university with the best overall record as an athlete and student. Football coach After graduating from Michigan, Dunne enrolled in law school at Northwestern University. While attending law school, he also served as the line coach for the school's football team from 1923 to 1926. In 1926, Dunne helped develop the Northwestern line into one of the most powerful in the West. The 1926 team tied with Michigan for the Western Conference title and held Notre Dame to one touchdown. In January 1927, Dunne was hired by Harvard University to serve as line coach for its football team under head coach Arnold Horween. Upon his hiring, the Harvard Crimson reported that Dunne had learned the game from Fielding Yost and noted that \\"he will bring to Harvard a thorough knowledge of a system that has won great success in the Western Conference.\\" Dunne coached the line at Harvard for five years, announcing his retirement from football in December 1930. In May 1935, Dunne, then a sitting judge on the Chicago Municipal Court, was appointed line coach for the University of Chicago football team. He was assigned to develop the team's guards and tackles. Judicial career Dunne received Big Ten medal from Coach Yost, June 1922. After leaving Harvard in 1930, Dunne returned to Chicago and entered the practice of law. In 1932, he was elected as a municipal court judge in Chicago. In 1936, he was elected as a judge of the Illinois Circuit Courts. Dunne spent his initial term as a Circuit Court judge working in the criminal courts. He was criticized in 1938 by the state's attorney's office after he placed 137 defendants on probation in an 18-month period. Two of the cases which aroused the prosecutor's criticism of Dunne were the case of a 19-year- old man convicted of manslaughter and a former official of Niles, Illinois convicted of embezzlement. Dunne defended his actions, stating that he believed that leniency would reclaim the defendants for society more surely than a prison sentence. When Dunne ran for re-election in 1939, the bar association committee on candidates endorsed his renomination by a vote of 1,558 to 226 with 88.94% rating him as fit. Dunne was re-elected and was assigned as the presiding judge in Juvenile Court in 1947. In 1948, Dunne described the position in the Juvenile Court as \\"the most heartbreaking job he has ever had.\\" He also called it \\"the most futile job he has known\\" in criticizing the lack of funding and resources to carry out the vital function. Dunne spent the last 20 years of his judicial career as the presiding probate judge in Chicago. In that position, he presided over lawsuits involving the estates of many of Illinois' most famous personalities. Among the noted cases in which Dunne presided are the following: * In 1959, Dunne presided over the probate of the estate of Grace Comiskey and a dispute over control of the Chicago White Sox between siblings Dorothy Comiskey Rigney and Charles Comiskey. Dunne rejected a petition by Charles Comiskey to block his sister's sale of a 54% interest in the club to Bill Veeck for $2.7 million. * Also in 1959, Dunne oversaw the probate of the estate of Ada Wrigley, the widow of William Wrigley, Jr., owner of the Chicago Cubs and the William Wrigley Jr. Company. The combined estates were valued at more than $40 million. * In 1960, Dunne was the presiding judge in a lawsuit concerning efforts of Charles O. Finley to purchase a 52% ownership interest in the Kansas City Athletics baseball team from the estate of Arnold Johnson. Dunne approved the sale despite concerns that Finley might move the club out of Kansas City. * In 1967, Dunne presided over the probate of the estate of Abe Saperstein, owner of the Harlem Globetrotters. Dunne approved the estate's sale of the Globetrotters to a syndicate led by Potter Palmer, scion of a wealthy Chicago family. Dunne retired from the bench in 1976. Later years and death In July 1969, Dunne received a Distinguished American Award from the Chicago chapter of the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame for carrying the lessons of football into a life of service to the community. After retiring from the bench in 1976, Dunne became associate counsel with the law firm of McBride, Baker, Wienke, and Schlosser. Dunne died in May 1980 at his home in Winnetka, Illinois. He was 80 years old at the time of his death and was survived by his wife, Margaret, three sons, Robert, Jr., Denis, and Albert Pyott, and a daughter, Carol D. Baranko.

Actually there were two such cutters, but the descriptions of these vessels and the dates of their service are such that they may well represent one vessel under successive contracts. The vessel or vessels cruised, blockaded, carried despatches and performed reconnaissance. First hired armed cutter Swan The first Swan was launched in 1797 and served the Royal Navy from 1 July 1799 to 24 October 1801 and also from 6 August 1803 to 21 October 1803. She was a cutter of 14 cannons - twelve 4-pounder guns and two 9-pounder carronades - and a burthen of 129 tons (bm). This vessel is almost certainly the Revenue cutter Swan V (referred to in the section \\"Swan Revenue Cutters\\" below) =Naval service= From 13 August to October 1799 Swan participated in the disastrous Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland under Vice Admiral Andrew Mitchell and Lieutenant General Ralph Abercromby against the Batavian Republic. On 28 August Swan, together with the Hired cutter Active, participated in the capture of the Dutch hulks Drotchterland and Brooderschap, and the ships Helder, Venus, Minerva, and Hector, in the Nieuwe Diep, in Holland. Swan was also among the vessels sharing in the proceeds from the surrender of the Dutch fleet in the Vlieter Incident. On 23 November 1799 Lieutenant-General Sir James Pulteney, second in command of the expedition, was on board Swan supervising the embarkation of the British and Russian troops. On 12 September there came in to Plymouth the Prussian galliot Vrouw Hildegarde. She had been sailing from Bordeaux to Hamburg with a cargo of brandy and wine when Swan captured her.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 2, p.353. On 26 February 1800, under Lieutenant Henry Stanley, Swan was on the Irish station. Here she captured the Uligeride Mercarius (Flying Mercurius), of Bremen, which Swan had detained while Uligeride Mercarius was on a passage to Bordeaux.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.236. On 1 March 1801, while under the command of Acting Lieutenant John Luckraft, Swan captured the French privateer Vengeur in the Channel, one league southwest of Praule Point. Vengeur was under the command of M. Le Roy, mounted two large swivels, and had a crew of 17 men, one of whom was wounded. She was ten days out of St Malo but had taken nothing. Luckraft further reported on behalf of the owners that due to the bad weather he had had the misfortune to lose one of their cutter's best boats boarding the privateer. Swan was under the command of Lieutenant Philip Browne from 26 February to 17 March 1802. During this period Swan intercepted and seized several notorious smugglers. Browne then transferred to the gun-brig in May.Marshall (1928), Supplement, Part, p.97. On 26 October 1803 Swan sailed in company with four transports from Portsmouth to Plymouth. There they were to pick up troops for Cork. An agent for the Royal Navy, Captain Watson, accompanied them.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 10, p.457. Under the command of Lieutenant William Richard Wallace she recaptured Jane on 25 January 1805. The next day she captured Fly (or Vlieg), a Danish privateer of 18 men that had captured Jane. On 19 March salvage arising from the recapture of Jane was due to be paid at Yarmouth, and on 28 May prize monies resulting from the capture of Fly were due to be paid on board. On 10 May 1805 Swan was part of a squadron under Rear-Admiral Thomas McNamara Russell when the squadron captured the Dorothea Elizabeth. Three French privateer luggers captured Swan off the Needles on 20 March 1807.Lloyds List 24 March 1807, №4137. Accessed 5 November 2016. =Prize money= On 18 May 1802 there was an announcement in the press that the proceeds arising from the capture of the Uligeride Mercarius would be due for payment at Dartmouth, or on Swans next arrival there. On 24 February 1802 prize money resulting from the capture of the Drotchterland, Brooderschap, Helder, Venus, Minerva, and Hector was due to be paidhttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hired_armed_cutter_Swan&action;=edit&section;=1. Lastly, between 17 November and 30 December, prize money resulting from the expedition to Holland was due for payment. On 4 July 1802 orders were received at Portsmouth for Swan, among a number of other vessels including Bulldog and Serpent, to be put in commission.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, p.84. Serpent may have been , an ex-Dutch hoy of four guns, that the Navy had purchased in 1794 and sold in 1802. Bulldog may have been Bulldog, which had been a powder hulk in Portsmouth since her recapture in 1801, and which was broken up in 1829. As neither this Serpent nor Bulldog appear to have been recommissioned, this Swan may also have not, in which case she would not be the second Swan. Second hired armed cutter Swan The second Swan was a cutter of ten 12-pounder carronades and 119 tons burthen (bm) that served the Royal Navy from 3 August 1807 until the Danes captured her on 24 April 1811 during the Gunboat War.Anderson gives the day as 23 April, Winfield gives it as 24 April, and Gossett gives it as 25 April. During Swans contract she was under the command of Lieutenant Mark Robinson Lucas. On 24 August 1807, Swan captured the Haabet, Joost, Master. On 24 May 1808 she found herself in action off the island of Bornholm with a Danish cutter-rigged vessel. Swan had been carrying despatches when she had spotted the Danish vessel and lured her out. After a chase of about two hours, Swan was in a position to open fire. Twenty minutes into the engagement the Danish cutter exploded. Swan suffered no casualties despite coming under fire both from the Danish vessel and the batteries on Bornholm. The fire from the batteries and the sighting of Danish boats approaching forced Wallace to withdraw without being able to make efforts to rescue survivors. The Danish cutter appeared to be of about 120 tons, to have mounted eight or ten guns, and apparently was full of men. The Danish cutter turned out to be the privateer Habet. Four days later Swan captured the Danish brigs Emanuel and Aall. On 15 November 1808 Swan captured the Anna Dorothea. Then Swan captured Constantine Pawlowitz on 4 August 1809. Later in 1809 Lucas removed from Swan. In December 1809 Swan captured Friendschaff (5 December), Neptunus, and St. Johanna (10 December). On 4 August 1810, Swan was under the command of Edward Mourilyan when she captured the Juliana Carolina. On 25 August Swan brought in to Hano Bay, Sweden, where Vice-Admiral Sir James Saumarez and his flagship then were, a Danish privateer rowboat with 11 men, one of whom had been killed and another wounded in attempting to make their escape. Swan also brought in a galiot that she had recaptured. On 6 January 1811 Swan was in Yarmouth for repairs, having had to cut away masts during a gale. On 19 April 1811, Swan captured Baron Rhanizen Lhen and Bellona. That same day she captured Lykkern Prove, Peterson, Master. On 24 April 1811, Swan and hired armed cutter Hero anchored off Kungsholm; at 3am the next morning they saw three Danish gunboats in The Sleeve (Sunningesund), approaching them. The two British cutters cut their cables and attempted to escape. Shots from one of the gunboats damaged Swan and one shot resulted in the wetting of her powder magazine. As the wind died off, the gunboats concentrated on Swan, forcing her surrender. The Danes boarded her but were able to retrieve little before Swan sank off Uddevalla, on the Swedish coast north of Gothenburg. The fight cost Swan two men killed and one wounded. The same battle apparently also resulted in damage to Hero.Gossett has Hero being sunk, but does not report any court date. All other reports have Hero damaged, but continuing to serve until November 1811. Swan Revenue cutters of Cowes There were five successive Swan Revenue cutters, all of which were in the service of HM Collector of Customs at Cowes. More specifically, there was a Swan of 130 tons (bm) and fourteen 4-pounder guns under the command of Francis Sarmon which received a Letter of Marque on 25 February 1793. Although these Swans were primarily in the service of the Crown as Revenue \\"cruizers\\", in time of war the Admiralty periodically deployed the cutters for naval assignments, e.g. carrying despatches, reconnaissance, or as a transport. In fact Francis Sarmon captained three of these Swans: Swan I was converted for Revenue use in 1783 and brought into service (under the Revenue's contract system - the Collector being personally financially liable) but was wrecked later that year. Swan II was built 1784. Francis took over as its captain from his brother George Sarmon in 1786; she was also wrecked (in 1792). The contract system was abolished in 1788 and financial responsibility was assumed by the Board of Customs. Swan III was refitted by the Commissioners of Customs from a seized smuggling cutter in 1792 at London; three French frigates captured her on 14 October 1795 whilst she was carrying despatches for the Navy. Swan IV (built 1796) was captured in an action against a French privateer on 14 December that same year. Francis Sarmon and two seamen were killed and her captors took Swan into Le Havre.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.259.Lloyds List 27 December 1796, №2884. Accessed 5 November 2016. Swan V was launched in 1798, and was captured by three French privateer luggers on 20 March 1807. Swan V (commanded by William Ferris) was under Admiralty orders as a participant in the expedition to Holland in 1799. Swan V became the French privateer Indomptable. recaptured her in 1810.Lloyd's List,№4499. This vessel's actions in naval service are described in more detail under the section above \\"First hired armed cutter Swan\\". Following the capture of Swan V in 1807, no further Swans were commissioned by the Collector of Customs in Cowes.

It was written by Eric Buchman and directed by Michael Grossman. The episode aired on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on January 25, 2007. In the episode, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), and Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) struggle to be considered for the position of chief of surgery after Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) announces his plans for retirement. Further storylines include Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) mourning his father, Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) trying to get financial support for a free clinic, and Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) dealing with her troubled relationship with Burke. Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, filming occurred in Los Angeles, California. Loretta Devine (Adele Webber) reprised her role as a guest star, in addition to Rachel Boston (Rachel Meyer) and Jessica Stroup (Jillian Miller). The title of the episode refers to the song, \\"Great Expectations\\", by American hard rock band Kiss. The episode received mixed to favorable reviews, with the storyline involving O'Malley's grieving being particularly highlighted. Running for 47 minutes and seven seconds, the episode was viewed by 21.50 million Americans in the United States upon its original airing, ranked first its time-slot and garnered a 7.6 Nielsen rating in the 18–49 demographic.  Plot  \\"Great Expectations\\" opens to a voice-over narration from Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) about the expectations on becoming a surgeon. Following the death of Harold O'Malley (George Dzundza), his son Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight), is seen using sex as way to cope with the devastating news, much to the displeasure of his girlfriend, Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), who seeks help from Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), O'Malley's best friend. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) unexpectedly announces his plans of retirement, which lead to Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) and Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), four of the hospital's attending surgeons, to compete for the position of chief of surgery. Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is facing difficulties her relationship with Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), whose betrayal is seen to have resulted in reciprocated silent treatment. Resident Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) expresses her desire to open a free clinic, adjacent to the hospital, but deals with rejection from both the chief and the attending physicians, who find no practical reason for funding. A patient, Jillian Miller (Jessica Stroup), is admitted in obstetrics and gynaecology, and is revealed to suffer from advanced cervical cancer, which leads to her contacting her parents, from whom she ran away from years ago, along with her best friend Rachel Meyer (Rachel Boston). Stevens quickly becomes emotionally involved in the patient's situation and encourages her to return home, after learning that the two girls were Amish, shunned from their natal village. Torres and Yang operate on a runner who is admitted in orthopedics, coping with the news that he will never be able to compete in races after the extensive surgical procedure. Sloan announces his plans of returning to New York City, but abruptly decides to stay in Seattle, following Grey accidentally revealing Webber's retirement plans. Shepherd is displeased with Sloan's decision, which results in an argument between him and Grey, which threatens putting damage on their relationship. Webber returns to his wife, Adele (Loretta Devine), seeking forgiveness, but is left devastated at the realization that she has been spending the night with another man. Bailey ultimately finds support in Stevens, who proves enthusiastic to spend her entire US$8 million inheritance, for the opening of the free clinic. At the conclusion of the episode, Yang confides in Burke, who unexpectedly proposes to her, whereas O'Malley, who finally admits how affected he was by the death of his father, proposes to Torres.  Production  The episode was written by producer Eric Buchman, while filmmaker Michael Grossman directed it. Buchman explained how his main concept for the episode was to describe O'Malley's grieving in a different way than depicted for Stevens, but in a manner that would be both bothering to her and painful for his partner, Torres. However, he stated that Torres' emotional state during the mourning was also significant to the episode: \\"We wanted Callie to feel some remorse. She finally got George, but not in the way she wanted. She's gotten his body, but the underlying relationship isn't there anymore.\\" Buchman disclosed that one of the story lines he had originally intended to include in the scrip was Yang and Burke's cold relationship being \\"kept alive\\" by having silent sex, which ultimately did not occur, due to being looked upon as \\"boring, neither dramatic, nor comedic\\", and also as not being descriptive of the character's feelings. The story line involving the four attending physicians fighting for the title of chief of surgery, was described by Buchman as a comic relief, used to emphasize a childish side of the characters' personalities which had not been previously developed. In addition, Buchman described Webber's retirement as an attempt to reconcile with his estranged wife, but leads to emotional devastation at the realization that she had moved on with a different man. The concept of Grey and Shepherd's fight was described by Buchman as having \\"no more taboos\\", compared to the other story lines developed in the episode: \\"Even though it was a minor fight, it's very revealing for Meredith. This is probably the longest relationship she's every been in, and the first with someone she feels a genuine connection with. We might know Derek will come back, but she doesn't.\\" The last scene of them in the episode has been deemed \\"a milestone of sorts for Meredith\\", with the goal to determine her to admit how new to this romantic development in her personal life she actually is, after years of being known as the woman with habitual excessive drinking and sexual relationships with inappropriate men. Also noted was the aftermath of Alex and Addison's kiss in the previous episode: \\"What's most painful about that scene? Not that Alex effectively shut Addison down in such a cold and direct manner. But that it seems like such a waste of chemistry. When they went into that closet, the last thing we wanted to see them do is pour water on their fire\\", stated Buchman, noting how the scene was written to be \\"frustrating, shocking, and therefore unexpected\\" for the audience.  Reception  The mourning manner of T.R. Knight's character was deemed inappropriate by critics. The episode was originally broadcast on January 25, 2007 at 9:00 ET, and averaged 21.50 million viewers, ranking third in weekly viewership with a 7.6 rating, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode was the sixteenth most-watched episode of the season, airing in the third week after the winter hiatus. Showing a significant decrease in ratings, the episode attracted approximately half a million less viewers than \\"Six Days (Part 2)\\", which received a 7.7 rating. \\"Great Expectations\\" was also the lead in the time slot, with approximately one-fourth more viewers than CBS's juggernaut CSI, which ranked fourth in weekly viewership with a 7.5 rating. Staci Krause of IGN had mixed perspectives on the episode's story arcs, comparing the advanced development in the personal story lines to the introduction of disappointing medical cases. She described the story line involving Yang and Burke's silent relationship as \\"finally showing resolution, taking pleasure to the next level\\", adding: \\"It was shocking to see Cristina be the one to break, but even more shocking was Burke's two-word response: marry me. I'm really not sure why Cristina didn't just say yes, since two minutes before had said she was in it for the long haul. It seems like they are dragging this out for the sake of dragging it out.\\" Bailey's evolution in the episode, mainly her interactions with four competing attending physicians, were described as \\"a reminder of why they called her the Nazi, something that was easy to forget with recent events.\\" Krause deemed the revelation of Adele's moving on \\"an interesting twist, with unexpected repercussions\\", whereas Stevens' offering Bailey the money to open the free clinic, was negatively reviewed; looked upon as the most predictable event of the episode. Krause noted that both medical cases were confusing, assessing that \\"it would have been nice to learn more about the severe dehydration that caused the runner's legs to swell.\\" In addition, Krause explained how the Amish angle was unexpected, but significantly helpful to the entertainment level, while a lack of realism in the medical case was highlighted: \\"No one bothered to really mention that it would have been nice, had it been caught earlier. It was, but she allowed herself to deteriorate.\\" The fight between Grey and Shepherd was deemed \\"a tiff that Derek was entirely responsible for\\", but also a proof of \\"how damaged Meredith really is\\". Krause expressed disappointment in the storyline involving O'Malley proposing to Torres: \\"Callie certainly didn't look thrilled. If she believes George is proposing as a means to get over his grief, she's probably right and should likely run in the opposite direction.\\" Considering each of the attending physicians' chances of becoming the chief of surgery, Krause noted the possibility of Sloan being chosen as \\"hilarious, but a tad unbelievable\\", whereas assessing that Montgomery's \\"great traits\\" might suffer, due to her relationship with Karev, which was described as \\"certainly bringing into question her ability to stay on the straight and narrow\\". Krause characterized the whole as \\"one of those guilty pleasures that many may not admit to\\". Kelly West of Cinema Blend also expressed mixed point of views on the episode, having different opinions on each storyline. She noted how the scene which sees Torres \\"desperately trying to escape George's room after three rolls in the hay with the grief-stricken intern\\" helped the episode reach a high level of entertainment: \\"The look, or should I say, looks on Izzie's face as Callie rambled on about legs being bent the wrong way and needing to heal after too much sex were priceless and could only matched by the look she gave to George when he opened the door, clearly ready for Callie once more.\\" She highly praised the scene that concludes Stevens' storyline in the episode, seeing \\"a heart to heart in which she agrees to back off\\". Shepherd's characterization was negatively responded to, whose enraged attitude was described as \\"unhealthy\\" for the evolution of his \\"fresh relationship\\" with Grey. West positively received the storyline involving the race for the title of chief, noting that \\"it was kind of funny to see like the attendings were the kids in the episode\\". In response to Bailey's storyline, which she deemed \\"not surprising\\", West stated: \\"He tells Bailey that it's her that will eventually be Chief when she’s ready. Miranda's reaction could only be described as shock. While the other residents were running around trying to get information, she was so busy working on the free clinic project that she hadn’t even heard he was retiring.\\" The story of the two Amish girls was deemed \\"a little side story, which was actually quite touching and well written\\", being praised for the realistic portrayals and the effects the storyline had on Stevens. \\"I don't think I've ever realized that Callie and Cristina never really interacted before. When they did speak to one another the episode, their personalities clash right away. At first they were snippy to one another but the two bonded after slicing open a runner's legs and then operating on him.\\", assessed West, in response to Torres and Yang's arc, which was described as \\"an obvious parallel to the rest of the episode\\". West compared the reaction of Yang and Torres following the proposals, by noting that the former was \\"surprised and maybe a little bit touched\\", whereas Torres expressed fear and concern: \\"She's worried that he's only proposing because he's still getting over the loss of his dad and just needs someone to cling to. I adore George, but he's a mess right now and needs to get stuff straightened out before he makes any lifelong commitments.\\"  References  External links *\\"Great Expectations\\" at ABC.com * * Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Grey's Anatomy (season 3) episodes ","title":"Great Expectations (Grey's Anatomy)"},{"id":"26714406","text":"Melaghlin Ua Madadhan (died 1188) was King of Síol Anmchadha.

It was the only engagement of its type in Northern California during the war. Background Californios were angry at United States immigrants settling on their ranchos. Six men of the U.S. sloop Warren, who had gone ashore to buy cattle from Mexicans for food, were taken hostage by a group under Francisco Sánchez. One of the hostages was Lieutenant Washington Allon Bartlett, the alcalde of Yerba Buena (soon to be renamed San Francisco). Captains Joseph Aram and Charles Maria Weber, commanding U.S. volunteers at Santa Clara and San Jose respectively, were sent to free them. Sánchez had command of 200 men, so U.S. marines and artillery under Captain Marston were dispatched as reinforcement. James F. Reed, acting lieutenant of the San Jose volunteer contingent, was in the area to muster a rescue party for his family, members of the Donner Party snowbound in the high Sierras. The war made volunteers hard for him to find. Battle The Americans were in a mustard field in a dry creek when the Mexicans opened fire. Once the Americans reached open ground the fighting turned their way. An armistice was agreed after two hours, by which time four Mexicans were killed, with four Mexicans and two Americans injured. Tinkham writes, \\"The women stood on the housetops at Santa Clara and anxiously watched the battle. After the battle the regulars marched into the pueblo and were given a rousing reception and a dinner.\\" Aftermath The putative site of the \\"Armistice Oak\\" is marked beside El Camino Real near Lawrence Expressway. The Mexicans retreated to the Santa Cruz Mountains. On January 8, the Marines having arrived, Sánchez surrendered. The Americans did agree to respect the Californios' property.

In essence, several ACK responses may be combined together into a single response, reducing protocol overhead. However, in some circumstances, the technique can reduce application performance. Method and advantages As described in RFC 1122, a host may delay sending an ACK response by up to 500 ms. Additionally, with a stream of full-sized incoming segments, ACK responses should be sent for every second segment. Delayed ACKs can give the application the opportunity to update the TCP receive window and also possibly to send an immediate response along with the ACK. For certain protocols such as Telnet, delayed ACKs can reduce the number of responses sent by the server by a factor of 3, by combining the ACK, window update and the response data into one segment.http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-96 Problems The additional wait time introduced by the delayed ACK can cause further delays when interacting with certain applications and configurations. If Nagle's algorithm is being used by the sending party, data will be queued by the sender until an ACK is received. If the sender does not send enough data to fill the maximum segment size (for example, if it performs two small writes followed by a blocking read) then the transfer will pause up to the ACK delay timeout. Linux 2.4.4+ supports a \`TCP_QUICKACK\` socket option that disables delayed ACK. For example, consider a situation where Bob is sending data to Carol. Bob's socket layer has less than a complete packet's worth of data remaining to send. Per Nagle's algorithm, it will not be sent until he receives an ACK for the data that has already been sent. At the same time, Carol's application layer will not send a response until it gets all of the data. If Carol is using delayed ACKs, her socket layer will not send an ACK until the timeout is reached. If the application is transmitting data in smaller chunks and expecting periodic acknowledgment replies, this negative interaction can occur. To prevent this delay, the application layer needs to continuously send data without waiting for acknowledgment replies. Alternatively, Nagle's algorithm may be disabled by the application on the sending side.

In Latin American countries, especially Colombia, it is commonly made during Holy Week and the Christmas season. Ingredients vary by region, but usually consist of a flour-based batter fried in oil and dusted with sugar. In Colombia Hojuelas are commonly made during the Holiday season. They are generally eaten along with manjar blanco, natillas, and buñuelos. Hojuelas are usually made with wheat flour, eggs, water, and half a cup of orange juice or less. Strips of the batter are then fried with vegetable oil. In Chile In Chile, hojuelas derive from a traditional recipe using palm sap. Spanish saying \\"Miel sobre hojuelas\\" is a Spanish saying analogous to the English expression \\"Icing on the cake\\". Supposedly, the expression emerged when people added honey over hojuelas rather than sugar, and enjoyed the taste even more. It means something akin to making something good even better.

In 2010, Daniel Rubinoff and Patrick Schmitz at the University of Hawaii at Manoa first described the amphibious habits of the larvae in the moth genus Hyposmocoma of the family Cosmopterigidae of order Gelechioidea. Young of each species thrive both underwater in rushing streams and exposed to air on rocks poking out of the water. Rubinoff states, “These species are at least as different as chimpanzees are from us”. While some other caterpillars can survive for short periods under water, they are possibly the only air-breather that can thrive exclusively there. \\"No other animal that breathes air can handle being submerged for a month,\\" he says. These caterpillars don’t have gills or anything that covers the trachea to operate marine mammals' surface-to-breathe technique for respiration. Instead they appear to absorb oxygen directly through pores in their \\"skin\\" from the enveloping water. The caterpillars require flowing water to provide sufficient oxygen. They spin \\"silk\\" tethers to attach themselves to the downstream sides of rocks to keep from washing away. They cover themselves with silk \\"cases\\" in a variety of shapes and sizes that they add to as they grow, with names such as cones, bugles, burritos, cigars, candy wrappers, oyster shells, dog bones and bow ties. Rubinoff and Schmitz estimate that the genus has probably been evolving in the Hawaiian Islands for roughly 20 million years. The dating comes from a three-gene analysis of 89 species, calibrated with the ages of various islands. Each species has so far been found on only one island, typically in only one locale. Three separate lineages of moth independently developed this ability at different points in the past. Footnotes External links *\\"James Bond, Caterpillar\\" Article and video featuring Hyposmocoma.

Georgetti, who came from a family of landowners, became one of Puerto Rico's wealthiest sugar barons and benefactors. In 1917, he became the first Vice-president of the Puerto Rican Senate. Early years Georgetti (sometimes also spelled as \\"Giorgetti\\") was born in the town of Manatí. His father was Dr. Pedro Juan Giorgetti Battesti, an immigrant from Corsica and his mother Guadalupe Fernandez Vanga y Freites, native of Puerto Rico whose family were land owners. He became orphaned at a young age and went to live with his maternal uncle. He received his primary education in the Colegio de los Jesuitas de San Juan (School of the Jesuits of San Juan). Georgetti inherited the lands of his parents which his uncle administrated, during the time that he was in Corsica pursuing his secondary education at the Liceo de Córcega (Lyceum of Corsica).Personas Importantes Sugar baron Upon his return to Puerto Rico he found that the lands which he had left in the hands of his uncle had prospered enormously. Georgetti married Aúrea Balseiro Dávila in 1888. Together with his father-in-law, Rafael Balseiro, he purchased a company called Florida Agrícola and renamed it Sociedad Agrícola Industrial Balseiro y Georgetti (the Balseiro and Georgetti Industrial Agricultural Society). Georgetti founded and was the owner of the Plazuela Sugar Company, a sugar refinery, in the town of Barceloneta which had its own dock that was used to transport sugar by barge to the waiting ships on the ocean. The company, which was the core of his fortune, was the main source of income and employment of the towns' inhabitants. Georgetti expanded his sugar industry empire by purchasing land and other sugar refineries. Among the sugar plantations which Georgetti purchased were Los Canos in Arecibo and the Central Plata, in which he served as the corporation's president.Cronologia del Comercio y la indudstria He was also the owner of the island's second largest pineapple plantation. Giorgetti was also a member of the board of directors of various banks, including the American Colonial Bank, Banco Comercial de Puerto Rico and Banco Nova Scotia.Eduardo Giorgetti Y Su Mundo: La Aparente Paradoja De Un Millonario Genio Empresarial Y Su Noble Humanismo\\"; by Delma S. Arrigoitia; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto; ; Political career It was common practice in Puerto Rico for businessmen to become involved in politics. On December 23, 1897, Georgetti was named Mayor of Barceloneta by Sabas Marin Gonzalez, the then-appointed Spanish governor of Puerto Rico. After the United States invaded Puerto Rico and the island became a U.S. territory as a result of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, which ended the Spanish–American War, the military-appointed governor, Major General John R. Brooke, permitted, upon the advice of Luis Muñoz Rivera, that Georgetti continue as mayor. Under the new administration, Barceloneta was merged with the town of Manati, as part of a joint municipality. Georgetti did not agree with this, and fought successfully for the re-establishment of Barceloneta as a separate, stand-alone municipality. Georgetti continued to serve as mayor of Barceloneta from 1897 to 1898. He was a member of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico, which supported the Spanish government headed by Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, which had promised an autonomous government for Puerto Rico.Historia de Barceloneta After the Spanish–American War, when Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States, Georgetti, together with his friend Luis Muñoz Rivera, Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, Antonio R. Barceló and José de Diego, founded the Union Party of Puerto Rico. The party won the elections in 1904 and Georgetti was elected to the Puerto Rican House of Representatives. This Union Party opposed the passage of the U.S. Foraker Act, which extended every U.S. federal law into Puerto Rico, and subsumed the entire body of Puerto Rico's statutory and regulatory code under the framework of U.S. federal law. The Union Party also favored the acquisition of greater political autonomy for Puerto Rico, as a pathway to full independence. In 1916, Georgetti's long-time friend Luis Muñoz Rivera fell gravely ill in New York City and returned to Puerto Rico, staying in Georgetti's house to recuperate. Georgetti summoned Muñoz Rivera's wife and son, Luis Muñoz Marín, to Puerto Rico and informed them that he was suffering from an infection that had begun in the gallbladder, before expanding throughout his body.Bernier-Grand et al., p. 22 On November 15, 1916, Muñoz Rivera died during his stay in the Georgetti residence. Georgetti's 1914 Pierce Arrow automobile was used in the statesman's funeral procession. Together with a group of friends, Georgetti purchased Muñoz Rivera's newspaper La Democracia and provided Muñoz Rivera's widow Amalia Marín Castilla with a small monthly pension. La Democracia also provided Rivera's son, Muñoz Marin, with an outlet to publish his written works. Georgetti also purchased the Muñoz Rivera home in 1916 and donated it together with the Pierce Arrow car to the town of Barranquitas to be preserved as a national monument. After Muñoz Rivera's death, Barceló became the leading force behind the Union Party and its liberal ideas for the island. In the elections of 1917, the Union Party was victorious. Antonio R. Barceló was named President of the Puerto Rican Senate and Georgetti was named vice-president, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican to hold said position. In 1924, Barceló later formed a political coalition with José Tous Soto, the president of the pro-statehood Republican Party of Puerto Rico, and founded the Alianza Puertorriqueña (Puerto Rican Alliance). This coalition came about because both Barceló and Tous Soto came to believe that neither independence nor statehood would be considered by the United States. Therefore, rather than wage a futile political battle, their \\"Alliance\\" would concentrate on Puerto Rico's economic situation. This led to ideological conflict between Georgetti and Barceló. Georgetti was committed to the original independentista ideals of the Union Party, and found these incompatible with an \\"economic partnership\\" with the United States, as espoused by the Alliance coalition. Barceló and a group of party delegates had traveled to Washington, D.C. to seek changes in the Jones Act of 1917, by claiming that the Puerto Rican economy was sound and that Puerto Ricans were capable of electing their own governor. In response, Georgetti traveled to Washington as a representative of various island organizations, among them the Agriculturist Association and the Association of Sugar Producers. The group which he represented became known by the press as the Fuerzas Vivas (Live Forces). Georgetti and the Fuerzas Vivas submitted a \\"Fiscal Memorandum\\" to the U.S. Secretary of War, which presented a much bleaker view of the Puerto Rican economy. According to this memorandum, the island was on the brink of economic ruin unless it diversified its agricultural production, and become less dependent on the sugar industry as its sole source of income. Georgetti's actions were viewed by Barceló as an attempt by Georgetti and the Fuerzas Vivas to discredit Barceló and weaken the Alliance. Georgetti denied this, and quit the Alliance.El Pensador Later years Mansion Georgetti (1923), Santurce, Puerto Rico, Photo: Gil Amiaga In 1923, Georgetti and his wife built a mansion in Santurce. Known as the \\"Mansion Georgetti,\\" it was located on the Avenida Ponce de León (Ponce de León Avenue), designed and built by Czech architect Antonin Nechodoma, and considered to be the grandest mansion in the Caribbean at the time.Mansion Georgetti Prior to the mansion, Georgetti lived in a Rio Piedras house built in 1868. The house, known as the \\"Casa Georgetti,\\" is the oldest Spanish colonial structure in Puerto Rico. Georgetti and his wife did not have any offspring, however they were the benefactors of many talented children who lacked the economic means to pursue an education. As a philanthropist, he was a sponsor of the arts and sciences. Georgetti was also the president of the Children's Tuberculosis Sanitarium of Puerto Rico. Eduardo Georgetti died in his Santurce residence in 1937. His wife Aúrea died the following year.Eduardo Georgetti Their Mansion Georgetti was sold in 1971, demolished, and replaced with an apartment building complex. The Casa Georgetti in Rio Piedras was landmarked and restored to its original condition. Legacy The town of Barceloneta honored Georgetti's memory by naming a principal avenue and an urbanization (Villa Georgetti) after him. In the town of Santurce there is also a theater, Teatro Georgetti, named in his honor.Univision Other cities in Puerto Rico have honored his memory by naming several streets after him, including San Juan, Humacao, Comerio and Vega Alta.

In this writing Belgrano described the frustration he experimented before the constant resistance from the Spanish monarchy to the liberal changes he promoted from the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires. He also regretted the attitude of most merchants, which he considered were more interested in getting high profits than in the prosperity of the land. However, Belgrano did not support independentism by then, and during the British invasions he supported the Spanish monarchy. His perspective changed with the invasion of Spain by France during the Peninsular War, and Belgrano deemed such opportunity as a divine intervention.

It depicts Luna's wife Maria de la Paz Pardo de Tavera while sound asleep. It is currently a part of the art collection of the Lopez Museum.Honasan, Alya B. , lopezmuseum.org, October 16, 2007 Measuring 10½ inches × 12¾ inches, it is a contrapposto beneath the cover of bed sheets. The predominant color used by Luna for Ensueños de Amor is white with dashes of pink, green, and blue hues. Luna used rapid brush strokes to express the dreamy mood. The idealism of this painting masks a darker fact in real life, for although Luna was fond of his wife, he was unfortunately also prone to fits of violent jealousy. On September 23, 1892, after accusing her of adultery, he killed his wife and mother-in-law as well as seriously wounding his brother-in-law. Luna was charged with murder but was acquitted shortly thereafter, his deed judged as a crime of passion.

Background Asked in a January 2008 interview if there had been any progress when it comes to putting down ideas for the next Helmet album, Hamilton replied: \\"No. I've been busy working on jazz tunes. I've written four songs since the last tour ended but they're for this movie I'm working on. It has been nice though as I like to clear out the old palette and do other things. Helmet put two albums out in 18 months, Size Matters and Monochrome, so I think the next album has got to wait. I'm planning to sit down and write a couple songs in March but that is assuming I can get on a roll before we head out to Australia. But we probably won't get an album out until the end of the year.\\"Helmet's Page Hamilton: 'I'm Thinking Of 2 More Albums, As In 2 Years I'll Be Fifty' In that interview, Hamilton was hoping that he could \\"do two more albums and that there is also interest on the touring front. But as long as we can go play shows and people come out to them and I feel good about what we're doing, then we'll do it. Realistically, I'm thinking of two more albums after Monochrome as in two years I'll be fifty years old. So I'm thinking will I be capable? It is very physically demanding and people kind of under estimate the energy you have to put out to play this music. And I don't go out to do a half-assed job. So as long as I can maintain that high level and still feel great, I'll think about doing it.\\" Regarding the musical direction of the album, Hamilton told AOL's Noisecreep in March 2010 that, \\"It's a cool album. I'm really into it. It's really good. The mastering guy was freaking out. That makes you feel good. You have to take some time to step back from it. I'm the singer, songwriter, guitar player, producer. I do all the backing vocals and all the extra instruments. It's just about putting everything into it and making it great. You can't really worry about what people are going to say ... a lot of people have a musical agenda or a stylistic agenda. 'I like emo.' Well, we're not emo. 'OK fine.' We're not metal. We're not hardcore. It's just Helmet.\\"Helmet, 'Seeing Eye Dog' -- New Album Reception The NewReview gave the album a 3.5 out of 5 and stated \\"...Helmet still rock, but really haven’t been able to recapture the magic of their first three releases. I do have to say that I found Seeing Eye Dog to be better than Aftertaste, Size Matters and Monochrome combined. This album probably won’t open any new doors for the band. But just like that old dog that you’ve grown up with, even with all their faults, it sure is nice to still have them by your side.\\" Album variations Seeing Eye Dog was released in five different formats.

Art exhibits  Second Life has created an environment where artists can display their works to an audience across the world. This has created an entire artistic culture where many residents display art in the museums, galleries and homes they can buy or build using Second Life's powerful tools. Gallery openings even allow art patrons to \\"meet\\" and socialize with exhibiting artists and has even led to many real life sales. Numerous art gallery simulations (called \\"sims\\") abound in Second Life. Among the more popular galleries are the Sisse Singhs Art Gallery, the Windlight art Gallery and the Horus Art Gallery. Among the most notable of these was the art gallery sim Cetus Gallery District, the world's first virtual online urban arts district. Cetus was modeled on real world analogs such as New York's Chelsea gallery district as a mixed-use arts community of virtual galleries, offices, loft apartments, and coffee houses. Its many tenant-run businesses featured weekly live music performances, gallery openings, and literary events such as the virtual book launch for \\"Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human,\\" by Tom Boellstorf (Princeton University Press; 2008). Cetus was chosen Best Cultural Site in Second Life in 2007, and its creator avatar Xander Ruttan (real world arts professional Aaron Collins of California), was among the most influential art world avatars in SL. Cetus resulted in many ongoing collaborative efforts among the SL community of artists, designers, writers, and virtual builders from across the real and virtual worlds. (Cetus was later bought by virtual artist DB Bailey and converted into a personal art project). The modeling tools from Second Life allow the artists also to create new forms of art that in many ways are not possible in real life due to physical constraints or high associated costs. The virtual arts are visible in over 2050 \\"museums\\" (according to SL's own search engine). In 2008 Haydn Shaughnessy, real life gallerist, along with his wife Roos Demol hired a real life architect, New York based, Benn Dunkley to design a gallery in Second Life. Dunkleys goal was to design an interactive gallery with art in mind in a virtual world. \\"Ten Cubed\\" is a radical departure in art exhibition, a futuristically designed gallery showcasing art in a unique setting. On January 31, 2008, \\"Ten Cubed\\" was launched. For its inaugural exhibition, Crossing the Void II, owner and curator Shaughnessy selected five artists working in and with modern technologies. These artists included Chris Ashley based in Oakland, California, Jon Coffelt based in New York, New York, Claire Keating based in Cork, Ireland, Scott Kildall based in San Francisco, California and Nathaniel Stern originally based in New York, New York now in Dublin, Ireland.Inaugural artists in Crossing the Void IIfor \\"Ten Cubed,\\" curated by Haydn Shaughnessy Real life as well as Second Life editions are available from the gallery. The virtual creations from the metaverse are disclosed in real life by initiatives such as Fabjectory (statuettes) and Secondlife-Art.com (oil paintings). In April 2007 the huge gallery called crossworlds gallery opened its doors in Secondlife; therefore, the aim was to create an open space for art in virtual worlds. Also in 2007, artists Adam Nash, Christopher Dodds and Justin Clemens won a A$20,000 Second Life Artists in Residence grant from the Australia Council for the Arts. Their Babelswarm installation was launched in Second Life and The Lismore Regional Gallery in NSW, Australia on April 11, 2008 by Australia Council Chairman James Strong. In 2008, the French Artist Fred Forest had entered the virtual world of Second Life to show his art project for the first time in his country. He inaugurated his \\"Experimental Center of the Territory of M2\\" (\\"Centre expérimental du terrioire du M2\\"), where he invited politicians to discuss about sustainable development and digital identity card ( Capucine.net). In another art project, he discussed about art institutions in France in his action called \\"l'art de la corrida\\".  Live music  Live music performances in Second Life takes place in three distinctly different ways; * With in-world voice chat, where the user dons a headset and microphone then enables a Second Life browse to \\"broadcast\\" his voice to other users, much like a telephone conference call. * With streaming, where vocal and instrumental music by Second Life residents can be provided with the aid of Internet broadcast software, such as Shoutcast. This is input, via microphones, instruments or other audio sources, into computer audio interfaces and streamed live to audio servers. Similar to webcast radio, the audio stream from the live performance can be received in Second Life for the enjoyment of other Residents on their computer speakers. This started with performances by Astrin Few in May 2004 and began to gain popularity mid-2005. For example, the UK band Passenger performed on the Menorca Island in mid-2006. Another UK band, Redzone, toured in Second Life in February 2007. * With inworld samples, where sounds samples are uploaded and an inworld user interface – instruments – is made to trigger those. Unlike streaming, performing with inworld samples make use of the Second Life environment and creates a three-dimensional sound experience to the audience. The Avatar Orchestra Metaverse is the most prolific representative with this approach. Linden Lab added an Event Category \\"Live Music\\" in March 2006 to accommodate the increasing number of scheduled events. By the beginning of 2008, scheduled live music performance events in Second Life spanned every musical genre, and included hundreds of live musicians and DJs who perform on a regular basis. A typical day in Second Life will feature dozens of live music performances. In 2008 the UK act Redzone announced they would release their new live album only via Second Life. Redzone also began choreographing and synchronising their performances via MIDI in October 2008. Many amateur performers start their music careers in Second Life by performing at virtual karaoke bars or Open Mic, then progress to performing for \\"pay\\", or Linden dollars, in-world.  Filming with machinima  Film made in Second Life using machinima. Second Life is popular for filming with machinima. Virtual worlds can contain all aspects of real world filming techniques as well as many more not possible in the real world. It is far easier to create 3D objects in Second Life and film them than create them from 'scratch' using traditional CGI software. There are many machinima and performing arts groups that are active in Second Life and which participate in creative events such as the annual 48 Hour Film Project. There are also several machinima groups that actively promote the works of Second Life artists such as Machinima Mondays, Rezzed TV, MAGE Magazine and the Machinima Artist's guild.  Theater  Live theater is presented in Second Life. The SL Shakespeare Company performed an act from Hamlet live in February 2008. In 2009, the company produced scenes from Twelfth Night. In 2007 Johannes von Matuschka and Daniel Michelis developed Wunderland, an interactive SL theatre play at Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz in Berlin, Germany. In 2007, HBO hosted a comedy festival in Second Life, using live streaming audio. In March 2009, SL residents staged a two-day Virtually Funny Comedy Festival to \\"help build awareness for Comic Relief, Red Nose Day 2009 and of course, comedy in Second Life.\\" In December 2008, The Learning Experience, a not-for-profit virtual education campus in Second Life, staged its first live theater events with the production of two short plays, A Matter of Husbands by Ferenc Molnár and Porcelain and Pink by F. Scott Fitzgerald. In 2009, the TLE theater company began producing full-length plays in Second Life, starting with The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde in February, and followed by Candida by George Bernard Shaw in April. In 2008 The Avatar Repertory Theater company was set up. This is another Theatre company that works within SL.\\"Theatre in the Virtual World- A look at Avatar Repertory Theater\\" Breaking Character25 September 2012 last accessed 2012-10-24 In 2009 the Department of Drama at the University of Calgary mounted four short productions in the New Media Consortium theater as part of a class in performance in non-traditional spaces.

Books There have been several books written about experiences in Second Life. Second Life Love is example of such a book. It is a dialog between Per Olsen en Li Gang Qin about their partnership in Second Life. The authors have never seen each other in real life. Other books include Second Life For Dummies by Sarah Robbins and Mark Bell, which was published in 2008 and provides assistance for new users of the virtual world, including basics, how to meet people, ideas for activities and places to visit, including how to access real life education in Second Life. Additionally there are many poetry volumes available on Lulu and in SL, including the \\"Blue Angel Landing\\" volumes 1 and 2 with 3 due in 2019 which are compilations of poems written and read by poets in Second Life. Contributing editors include Persephone Phoenix, Huckleberry Hax, Hypatia Pickens and Grail Arnica. To find a generous collection of SL poetry books, visit Klannex Northmead's poetry library. Second Life artists = Annabeth Robinson = Annabeth Robinson, or AngryBeth Shortbread, creates online performances or installations using Second Life. For example, Robinson contributed to the 'Kritical Works in SL' project in 2008 to create a sound installation called Ping Space.

Other such work can be found at the Annabeth Robinson page. = Garrett Lynch = Garrett Lynch is an Irish new media artist working with networked technologies in a variety of forms including online art, installation, performance and writing. Since 2008 he has created a series of installation and performance works dealing with ideas of identity and place as they relate to networked spaces. In these works Lynch explores the \\"real\\" and the \\"virtual\\" through the transposing of his own identity to virtual worlds such as Second Life without any attempt to masquerade or imagine a new identity. This process involves the use of his real name for his \\"representation\\" or avatar, word play that references his names origins as both real and Irish and the use of a sandwich board prop stating this that is worn continuously. In 2010/2011 he was artist in residence at HUMlab, Yoshikaze Up-in-the-Air Residency. Outcomes of the residence have since been published as an artists book and an article in Metaverse Creativity (Volume 2, Number 2). Currently Lynch has and is currently performing with a custom-built scale reproduction of his Second Life \\"representations\\" sandwich board. This has been worn at a number of exhibitions and performances. = Gleman Jun = Gleman Jun is an Italian artist in Second Life. In the dynamic effects of colors, lights and transparencies, he expresses his creativity in a constantly evolving and transforming himself. In his case, a work of art is composed of two different elements: vision and technique. \\"Vision\\" is the image that passes through his mind suddenly. \\"Technique\\" is the experience that allows the memory to translate the vision into a \\"real\\" and shareable object. = Patrick Moya = Patrick Moya (born 1955 in Troyes, France), is a Southern French artist, living in Nice on the French Riviera. He is a part of the artistic movement \\"Ecole de Nice\\". Moya has been at the forefront since the 1970s of straddling the latest forms of media and technology to benefit art rather than rendering it extinct. He is an early pioneer of video art. = Second Front = Second Front is the first performance art group of Second Life. Founded in 2006, its current seven-member troupe includes Gazira Babeli (Italy), Yael Gilks (London), Bibbe Hansen (New York), Doug Jarvis (Victoria), Scott Kildall (San Francisco), Patrick Lichty (Chicago) and Liz Solo (St. Johns). Second Front members collaborate remotely and their performances have been shown live in New York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Brussels, Berlin, Vancouver and many other cities. The group has been written about in publications including ArtForum, Art in America, Realtime Arts (Australia), Exibart (Italy) and Digital Art, (Second Edition) by Christiane Paul (curator). Second Life Art group SL Art is one of the most popular art groups in Second Life. Its goal is to recognize the art in virtual worlds at the same level of visual art in real life.

Early life Lucien Joseph Jailler was born on 23 November 1889 in Le Coteau, France. He joined the French army in 1909. He learned to fly on his own in 1911, receiving a civil pilot's license on 10 November 1911. On 8 October 1912, he transferred to the 3e Groupe d'Aeronautique of the Aéronautique Militaire; the next year, he was permitted as a pilot with Military Pilot's Brevet No. 349. Despite this, Jailler began World War I assigned as a tractor driver for an escadrille at Épinal. Aerial service Jailler was promoted to Caporal on 23 March 1915. Shortly thereafter, he was finally assigned a flying slot on 1 April 1915, when he was assigned to Escadrille 15. He then was promoted to Sergent ten days after joining his new unit. On 16 May 1915, he was seriously wounded in combat. Five days later, he was awarded the Médaille militaire. It was 8 March 1916 before he scored his first win. He then added erratically to his score until 12 June 1917, when he scored his twelfth. During July 1916, after Jailler shot down a German observation balloon for his fourth win, he was promoted to Adjutant. On 8 July, he was also appointed a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur. He would score twice more that year, to end the year an ace. Jailler was commissioned a sous lieutenant on 22 August 1917. On 23 November 1917, he was pulled from combat for a rest, after 232 flying hours and 27 dogfights, and became an instructor. Post World War I Lucien Joseph Jailler died in Saint-Leger-sur-Loire, France on 2 June 1921 after a brief sickness. Notes References * Nieuport Aces of World War 1. Norman Franks.
