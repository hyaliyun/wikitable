Most of the songs are cover versions of existing songs with altered lyrics. Some of the songs function as simple Smurf sing-a-longs (\\"Smurfs are Back\\") while others have more of an apparent satirical intent (\\"The Noisy Smurf\\"). \\"I've Got a Little Puppy\\" was released as a single in the UK and reached number 4 in the Official UK Top 40 Single Charts in September 1996. The Smurfs were keen to include versions of Roll with It, Wonderwall and Some Might Say by British rock band Oasis, but they were refused by Noel Gallagher who said \\"We hated the Smurfs as kids, I'm not letting a bunch of blue guys in white hats touch our stuff\\". Track listing # \\"Smurfs Are Back\\" – based on \\"No Limit\\" by 2 Unlimited. The repeated chant \\"no, no\\" from the original song is replaced with \\"yeah, yeah\\" leading to a climax of \\"Smurfs are back, yeah!\\" # \\"Mr Smurftastic\\" – based on \\"Boombastic\\" by Shaggy. # \\"I've Got a Little Puppy\\" – based on \\"I Wanna Be a Hippy\\" by Technohead. The high-pitched dance vocals of the original are replaced to comical effect with a more innocent tale about a dog. The high point of the remake is the refrain of \\"pooper, pooper scooper!\\" # \\"The Noisy Smurf\\" – based on \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\" by Björk. The alternating loud and soft vocals of the original are ideal for this tale of a noisy Smurf who pops up to disturb the peace. # \\"Find the Smurf\\" – based on \\"Love Is All Around\\" by The Troggs. The new version's lyrics bear almost no resemblance to the Wet Wet Wet hit, other than \\"We've looked all around\\" planted in the chorus. # \\"Smurfland\\" – based on 1972 song \\"Living Next Door To Alice\\" by Australian group New World. The song has been covered by a number of acts including Smokie and Roy Chubby Brown # \\"Our Smurfing Party\\" – based on \\"Saturday Night\\" by Whigfield. # \\"Don't Stop Smurfing\\" – based on \\"Don't Stop (Wiggle Wiggle)\\" by Outhere Brothers. # \\"Smurfhillbilly Joe\\" – based on \\"Cotton Eye Joe\\" by Rednex. # \\"We're the Smurfs\\" – based on \\"Alright\\" by Supergrass. # \\"Smurfland Olympics\\" # \\"Smurfing Ways\\" # \\"Mr. Blobby & the Smurfs\\" – based on \\"Mr Blobby\\" by Mr Blobby. # \\"Football Forever\\" # \\"Smurfing World\\" Australian track listing In 1997, EMI released the album in Australia and New Zealand, but with a somewhat different track listing: # \\"Smurfs Are Back\\" # \\"Mr. Smurftastic\\" # \\"The Noisy Smurf\\" # \\"Smurfin' Alive\\" – based on Stayin' Alive by the Bee Gees. # \\"Keep On Smurfing\\" # \\"Get Yourself Smurfing\\" – based on Naked by Louise. # \\"Dancing Queen\\" – a straight cover, with no altered lyrics, of Dancing Queen by ABBA. # \\"We're the Smurfs\\" # \\"True Blue\\" – based on MMMBop by Hanson # \\"Our Smurfing Party\\" # \\"Wannabe a Smurf Star\\" – based on Wannabe by the Spice Girls # \\"Roller Blade Smurfs\\" # \\"Football Forever\\" # \\"Ooh...Aah Smurf A Little Bit\\" – based on Ooh Aah...

Plot Hawkeye writes another letter home to his father, detailing some of the recent events at the 4077th: amongst the latest batch of wounded is a soldier with a live grenade shot into his body, and Sergeant Condon, who reminds the doctors to give him the \\"right color\\" blood. Hawkeye, Trapper and Ginger decide to teach Condon a lesson on racism. The monthly staff meeting was also held—-although the previous meeting was held six months earlier—and the latest meeting appears to be no more productive than the previous one, which, according to Radar's minutes, was \\"declared a shambles\\". Henry also receives a home movie of his daughter's birthday party from his wife, which he watches in his office with Hawkeye, Trapper and Radar-—along with footage from a few years previously of Henry and his wife goofing in front of the camera with their neighbors. Notes \\"Dear Dad... Three\\" was the first of three episodes to feature home movies in the episode plot. The season three episode \\"There is Nothing Like a Nurse\\" featured the main male characters, minus Frank Burns, watching a home movie of Frank's wedding, and the season four episode \\"Mail Call...Again\\" featured the main characters watching a movie of Radar's family sitting down to Sunday lunch at the family farm in Ottumwa, Iowa. This episode also contains a claim that Dr. Charles Drew, known for his pioneering work with blood plasma, died in a North Carolina hospital which refused to admit him or treat his injuries based on his race.

Life and artistic career Scarpitta was born in New York City in 1919 to a Sicilian father, sculptor Salvatore Cartaino Scarpitta, and Polish-Russian mother. His family relocated to Los Angeles when he was six months of age. He graduated from Hollywood High School, and then attended the premier art university in Europe, the Academia di Belle Arti in Rome.Shattuck, Kathryn (April 16, 2007). Salvatore Scarpitta, New York Artist, Dies at 88. New York Times He served in the United States Navy during World War II as a \\"Monuments Man\\", finding, preserving and cataloging art stolen by the Nazis. After the war, Scarpitta remained in Rome and worked from his studio on Via Margutta. During his time in Rome he was represented by the leading Avant-garde modern art gallery in Italy, Galleria La Tartaruga. In 1958, Leo Castelli saw his work and asked him to move to New York and join his gallery. Scarpitta remained with Castelli until the latter's death in 1999. From 1959 until 1992, Scarpitta had 10 one man shows at the Castelli Gallery in New York. He also was a part of many Castelli group shows that included artists such as Norman Bluhm, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, John Chamberlain and Julian Schnabel. Scarpitta's works are part of the permanent collections at the Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 in New York, Whitney Museum of American Art, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, the Kunstsammlungen zu Weimar Museum in Germany, Civico Museo d'Arte Contemporanea in Milan, the Guttuso Museum in Italy and the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston. Scarpitta also exhibited at numerous Venice Biennials. In 2000 and 2001 Scarpitta was an Artist-in-Residence at the McColl Center for Art + Innovation.McColl Center Artist-in-Residence: Fall/Winter/Spring 2001 His work is characterized by wrapped canvasses, found and wrapped objects made into sleds, and automobile themes. Motor racing Scarpitta was the owner of a sprint car team based in New Chester, Pennsylvania. The car was campaigned under the number 59 and was a regular on the very competitive central Pennsylvania circuit. He had many drivers of note and many victories. Greg O'Neill, Rick Schemlyun, Jr., Bobby Essick, Steve Christmas, Richard Lupo, Richard Lupo, Jr., Steve Stambaugh, Joey Allen, Kenny Adams, Jesse Wentz, Keith Kauffman, Bill Brian, Steve Siegel and Jimmy Siegel filled the number 59 seat at one time or another. Scarpitta was well-respected as an owner, and upon his retirement as the team principal, the team was sold to the Siegels; it still carries the number 59 today. The car had victories at the Williams Grove, Lincoln and Susquehanna Speedways. He was close friends with fellow car owner Harry Fletcher. Scarpitta loved racing most, and it was his outsider perspective that made him unique to the world of racing. Because of his slant, he enjoyed the entire spectrum of the experience of sprint car racing and cared much less about statistics. From the arrangement of tread on the tires, the organic aspects of mud, the smell, sounds, right through to the human drama that surrounded it all, racing was his favorite thing. He was just as apt to put a tried and true veteran driver in the car as he was to choose a driver with little experience. The different personalities made the experience entirely different from year to year. Death Scarpitta died from complications of diabetes in Manhattan, aged 88. He was survived by his third wife, Dana Scarpitta, and two daughters, artist Lola Scarpitta Knapple and Stella Scarpitta Cartaino.

The episode aired on November 17, 1973. Plot Hawkeye's picnic date with new nurse Lieutenant Marquette (Teri Garr) is interrupted by gunshots from a sniper. The couple quickly heads back to the camp, where everyone but Radar and Colonel Blake, who are pinned down in the showers, shelters in the main hospital building. Eventually Radar and the Colonel join the staff in the hospital building and they manage to treat casualties which soon arrive. Help from headquarters is not immediately forthcoming, and Frank's attempts to be \\"a real man\\" (encouraged by Margaret) leads him and Hawkeye to ambush a figure in the mess tent, who turns out to be Radar, desperate for food. It's not until the following day that outside help arrives, in the form of a US army helicopter firing shots at the sniper. Hawkeye operates on the sniper, and reports to the Swampmen that the sniper was a scared kid who got separated from his unit and targeted the camp in the belief that he was firing on MacArthur's headquarters. Notes Frank Burns discusses his medical training with Hawkeye, noting it took him \\"twice as long\\" as the usual time to qualify, and that he \\"flunked out of two med schools\\". While this departs from the background of the character of Frank Burns from the novel and the movie, it nonetheless echoes the non-standard medical training of these previous incarnations of the character. This episode also contains the only instance of onscreen nudity in the television series and one of the first depictions of nudity in prime time TV in the United States-—a brief glimpse of Gary Burghoff's buttocks as Radar's towel slips off as he runs into the shower tent to escape from the sniper fire.

The son of Lord Montague and his wife, Lady Montague, he secretly loves and marries Juliet, a member of the rival House of Capulet, through a priest named Friar Laurence. Forced into exile after slaying Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, in a duel, Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet's death. The character's origins can be traced as far back as Pyramus, who appears in Ovid's Metamorphoses, but the first modern incarnation of Romeo is Mariotto in the 33rd of Masuccio Salernitano's Il Novellino (1476). This story was reworked in 1524 by Luigi da Porto as Giulietta e Romeo (published posthumously in 1531). Da Porto named the character Romeo Montecchi and his storyline is near-identical to Shakespeare's adaptation. Since no 16th-century direct English translation of Giulietta e Romeo is known, Shakespeare's main source is thought to be Arthur Brooke's English verse translation of a French translation of a 1554 adaptation by Matteo Bandello. Although both Salernitano and da Porto claimed that their stories had historical basis, there is little evidence that this is the case. Romeo, an only child like Juliet, is one of the most important characters of the play, and has a consistent presence throughout it. His role as an idealistic lover has led the word \\"Romeo\\" to become a synonym for a passionate male lover in various languages. Although often treated as such, it is not clear that \\"Montague\\" is a surname in the modern sense.  Origins  The earliest tale bearing a resemblance to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is Xenophon of Ephesus' Ephesiaca, whose heroic figure is a Habrocomes. The character of Romeo is also similar to that of Pyramus in Ovid's Metamorphoses, a youth who is unable to meet the object of his affection due to an ancient family quarrel, and later kills himself due to mistakenly believing her to have been dead. Although it is unlikely that Shakespeare directly borrowed from Ovid while writing Romeo and Juliet, the story was likely an influence on the Italian writers whom the playwright was greatly indebted to. The two sources which Shakespeare most likely consulted are Brooke's translation of de Porta and William Painter's The goodly historye of the true, and constant Love between Romeo and Juliet.Hunter & Lichfield, p. 11  Film portrayals  Romeo and Juliet has been adapted into film several times, and the part of Romeo has been played by several actors, including * Leonard Whiting * Leslie Howard * Laurence Harvey * Leonardo DiCaprio * Douglas Booth * Orlando Bloom * Louis de Wolff  References   Bibliography  *  External links  * Complete listing of all of Romeo's lines Category:Literary characters introduced in 1597 Category:Fictional Italian people in literature Category:Fictional princes Category:Fictional murderers Category:Male Shakespearean characters Category:Male characters in literature Category:Characters in Romeo and Juliet Category:Fictional suicides Category:Teenage characters in film ","title":"Romeo"},{"id":"10730536","text":"23 Pashons - Coptic calendar - 25 Pashons Fixed commemorations All fixed commemorations below are observed on 24 Pashons by the Coptic Orthodox Church Feasts * Feast of the Entry of Christ in Egypt (one of the seven minor feasts) Saints * Prophet Habakkuk * Saint Bashnouna (880 A.M.), (1164 A.D.)

Background From 1918 to 1922, Japan began conducting secret operations in the Xinjiang area. Japanese Genyosha agents operated undercover in Hami and other cities to gain information about the Soviets in Central Asia. During the 1930s, the Imperial Intelligence Services was interested in gaining in-depth intelligence about Tibet and Xinjiang. In the Kantogun headquarters, a series of undercover operations were organized and Jinzō Nomoto and others were sent on such missions. At the same time, Germany also sent expeditions to the same areas in Xinjiang. Expedition In 1935, Jinzō Nomoto, from Kagoshima, was sent to Manchukuo and was posted to an intelligence unit in the Japanese Kantogun Army as a Mongolian language research student specializing in Central Asian issues. In May 1939, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Nomoto secretly entered Tibet by disguising himself as a Mongolian and accompanying a Tibetan monk, beginning an 18-month intelligence-gathering mission. He collected information regarding the social conditions, culture, religion and local policies of the natives through personal interviews with local residents; he submitted this intelligence mainly to the Intelligence Army Bureau. He left the area in October 1940. The Muslim Chinese (Dungan) General Ma Bufang was an obstruction to Japanese agents trying to contact the Tibetans; he was labelled as an \\"adversary\\" by a Japanese agent. Aftermath Other agents continued secret moves in the area by meeting local Afghan tribesmen to organize infiltrations, sabotage and disturbances in British India on the North West Frontier in case of a Japanese invasion of India. Another alleged interest in the Tibet area was the recovery of all information related to ancient powers related in Tibetan legends.

The French protectorate of Tunisia that was established lasted until the independence of Tunisia on 20 March 1956. Context =Early contacts= Muhammad III as-Sadiq (Sadok Bey), Bey of Tunis between 1859 and 1881. Tunisia had been a province of the Ottoman Empire since the Conquest of Tunis (1574), although with great autonomy under the authority of a Bey. In 1770, Brigadier Rafélis de Broves bombarded the cities of Bizerte, Porto Farina and Monastir in retaliation for acts of piracy.. In the 19th century Tunisian commercial contacts with Europe were numerous, and there was a population of French, Italian and British expatriates in the country, represented by Consulates. France had also made a major loan to Tunisia in the mid-19th century. The Tunisian government was weak, with an inefficient tax system that only brought it one-fifth of the tax collected. The economy was crippled with a series of droughts and the elimination of corsairs by Western fleets. Lastly, Tunisians had little control on foreign trade as ancient 16th century agreements with European powers limited custom taxes to 3%. As a result, its small industry was devastated by imports, especially in the area of textiles. =Colonial competition= Following the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, France's international prestige was severely damaged, and both Italy and the United Kingdom attempted to reinforce their influence in Tunisia. The Italian representative failed through clumsiness, but the British representative Richard Wood was more successful. In order to limit French influence, Wood obtained the reinstatement of Tunisia as a province of the Ottoman Empire in 1871, although the region's autonomy was also guaranteed. Great Britain continued to try to exert influence through commercial ventures, but these were not successful.. There were also various Tunisian land ownership disputes among France, Britain and Italy. The French wished to take control of Tunisia, which neighboured their existing colony of Algeria, and to suppress Italian and British influence there. At the Congress of Berlin in 1878, a diplomatic arrangement was made for France to take over Tunisia while Great Britain obtained control of Cyprus from the Ottomans. Subsequently, the use of Tunisian territory as a sanctuary by rebel Khroumir bands gave a pretext for the military intervention. Occupation ironclad Colbert took part in the invasion of Tunisia. On 28 April 1881, 28,000 men under General Forgemol de Bostquénard entered Tunisia. On 1 May, the city of Bizerte surrendered to the 8,000 men of , who then continued to Tunis. Bréart entered Tunis between May 3 and May 6, 1881. He had in his possession the Bardo Treaty establishing a protectorate on Tunisia, which had just been cabled to him by the French government. On May 11, Bréart, the general consul Théodore Roustan, and the General Pierre Léon Mauraud, accompanied by an armed escort, presented the treaty to Muhammad III as-Sadiq (Sadok Bey), Bey of Tunis between 1859 and 1881, who resided in Ksar Saïd. Surprised, Sadok Bey requested several hours for reflection, and immediately gathered his cabinet. Some of its members insisted that the bey should escape towards Kairouan to organize resistance, but Sadok Bey decided to accept the protectorate. The Bardo Treaty was signed by both parties on 12 May 1881. An insurrection soon broke out in the south on 10 June 1881, and then in Sfax. Six ironclads were dispatched from Toulon (Colbert, Friedland, Marengo, Trident, Revanche, Surveillante) to join the French Navy ships in Tunisian waters. In Sfax, three ironclads from the Division of the Levant were already present (Alma, Reine Blanche, La Galissonnière), together with four cannon boats. Sfax was bombarded, and on 16 July the city was invested after hard fighting, with 7 dead and 32 wounded for the French. At Kairouan 32,000 men, 6,000 horses and 20,000 tons of supplies and material were landed. Kairouan was taken without a fight on 28 October 1881. Consequences Great Britain and Germany silently approved the invasion of the country, while Italy protested in vain. Tunisia thus became a French protectorate, with great powers for the French, the French Resident being simultaneously Prime Minister, controller of the State's finances, and Commander in Chief of its armed forces. In 1882, Paul Cambon energetically took advantage of his position as Resident, leaving the Bey essentially powerless, and in effect administering Tunisia as another French colony. The French established an important naval base at Bizerte in 1898. Italy would respond with the 1911–12 Italo-Turkish War leading to the Italian occupation of Libya.

There are 115 properties and districts listed on the National Register in the county, including 1 National Historic Landmark. Another 5 properties were once listed but have been removed. History 1871 Rendering of Knoxville, looking to the north-northwest The earliest settlers in what is now Knox County were Native Americans - the Indian mound is the primary \\"built structure\\" that remains from their era. Beginning with explorer Hernando de Soto, who traveled near the county, the earliest Europeans were not settlers but explorers and hunters who left no permanent structures. However, when North Carolina made land available in the Land Grab Act of 1783, early settlers began surveying the region. These men included General James White, who soon owned the land that became downtown Knoxville, as well as Frances Alexander Ramsey and Alexander McMillan. James White settled in rural east Knox County on the French Broad River in 1785, but constructed a cabin in what is now downtown Knoxville in 1786. General White later requested that his son-in-law, Charles McClung, survey the land around his cabin and lay out sixteen blocks with four lots on each block. After setting aside lots for his residence, a cemetery, college and other functions he deemed necessary, the balance of the lots were sold by lottery on October 3, 1791. In 1792, the community began to take shape: 1) Knox County, Tennessee, was split off from Hawkins County, Tennessee; 2) settlers were constructing buildings on lots they received in the lottery; 3) Samuel and Nathan Cowan opened the first store; and 4) the first tavern was opened by John Chisholm. In 1793, a garrison of soldiers was assigned to protect the settlers. Other than setting aside land for Blount College (now the University of Tennessee), the earliest structures were built to accommodate basic frontier needs. These included the fort, residences, churches, taverns (which also served as inns) and a cemetery. In terms of growth, development of the county was due both to expansion of the early settlement (a) and the development of roads (b), which linked James White's Fort to other parts of the state: (a) The original 16 square blocks was expanded to accommodate growth in the population. Moses White, James White's son, laid out East Knoxville, which was originally a separate city and called Mechanicsburg. Colonel John Williams laid out the west end of the town, which was briefly known as Williamsburg; and (b) Roads were constructed to allow access both to surrounding settlements in rural areas of Knox County, and to allow pioneers to travel from the east coast further west. Settlers typically traveled down from southwest Virginia through Rogersville, Tennessee on the Knoxville Road before arriving at Knoxville. By 1795, what is now Kingston Pike went from James White's Fort to the western end of the county. Beyond the western end of the county, this route became known as the Nashville Road. By 1807, the Knoxville Gazette reported that 200 settlers a day were passing through the city on their way further west. Further north in Knox County, Adair's Fort, built by John Adair in Fountain City, protected settlers traveling westward on the Emory Road. And by 1792, Alexander Cunningham was operating the first ferry over the Tennessee River south of Knoxville. Despite ceasing to be Tennessee's state capital in 1817, Knoxville continued to grow slowly through the antebellum period. And due to the mountainous terrain, slavery never took root as deeply in East Tennessee as it did in Middle Tennessee and West Tennessee. The valleys of East Tennessee, such as the area west of Knoxville accessed by Kingston Pike, did have plantations, a few of whose houses still remain. And the Tennessee River was not as navigable at Knoxville as it was further downstream, so, other than the roads, the city remained comparatively isolated until the railroads reached the city in 1855. Then, due to Knoxville's central location in the southeast and the railroads that traversed it, the city experienced explosive growth. Initially, the East Tennessee & Virginia Railroad (which soon became the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad, and later became part of Southern Railway) began operations in the city. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad soon followed, giving Knoxville access to two prominent transportation companies and two rail stations of architectural significance. The 1880s were the greatest growth period in the city's history, although there was substantial growth after World War II. 1886 Aerial Rendering of Knoxville Structures now listed on the National Register of Historic Places largely reflect this expansion. There were isolated pockets of settlement, such as the Ramsey House and Marble Springs, in what remains the rural part of the county. As Kingston Pike developed, Crescent Bend and other estates were constructed in what soon became affluent western Knox County. Kingston Pike also linked Bearden, Ebenezer's Mill, and later linked Farragut, Concord and Kingston to Knoxville. There was a flurry of commercial and residential development in the late 19th century. As electric streetcars began operation, suburban expansion moved both north and south. Automobiles allowed further urban sprawl to develop. As the county has expanded, many historic structures have been lost to development. Examples include: 18th-century Chisholm Tavern, which was not demolished until the 20th century as part of the construction of James White Parkway; the Mabry Hood House on Kingston Pike, which was demolished to allow construction of Pellissippi Parkway; and the Baker Peters House on Kingston Pike, which has survived, but has been stripped of its context due to surrounding commercial development, including a carwash in its front yard. By 1900, all that remained of James White's Fort was the fort's main house, which itself was dismantled and moved to a farm outside the city in 1906. In the 1960s, preservation groups moved the house to its present location on Hill Avenue, and reconstructed its historic palisades and outbuildings. Because it has been moved from its original location, the fort is not eligible for listing on the National Register.

B and C have the same apparent distance from the star as seen from Earth. A light echo is a physical phenomenon caused by light reflected off surfaces distant from the source, and arriving at the observer with a delay relative to this distance. The phenomenon is analogous to an echo of sound, but due to the much faster speed of light, it mostly only manifests itself over astronomical distances. For example, a light echo is produced when a sudden flash from a nova is reflected off a cosmic dust cloud, and arrives at the viewer after a longer duration than it otherwise would have taken with a direct path. Because of their geometries, light echoes can produce the illusion of superluminal motion. Explanation The distance traveled from one focus to another, via some point on the ellipse, is the same regardless of the point selected. Light echoes are produced when the initial flash from a rapidly brightening object such as a nova is reflected off intervening interstellar dust which may or may not be in the immediate vicinity of the source of the light. Light from the initial flash arrives at the viewer first, while light reflected from dust or other objects between the source and the viewer begins to arrive shortly afterward. Because this light has only traveled forward as well as away from the star, it produces the illusion of an echo expanding faster than the speed of light. In the first illustration above, light following path A is emitted from the original source and arrives at the observer first. Light which follows path B is reflected off a part of the gas cloud at a point between the source and the observer, and light following path C is reflected off a part of the gas cloud perpendicular to the direct path. Although light following paths B and C appear to come from the same point in the sky to the observer, B is actually significantly closer. As a result, the echo of the event in an evenly distributed (spherical) cloud for example will appear to the observer to expand at a rate approaching or faster than the speed of light, because the observer may assume the light from B is actually the light from C. All reflected light rays that originate from the flash and arrive at the Earth together will have traveled the same distance. When the rays of light are reflected, the possible paths between the source and the Earth that arrive at the same time correspond to reflections on an ellipsoid, with the origin of the flash and the Earth as its two foci (see animation to the right). This ellipsoid naturally expands over time. Examples =V838 Monocerotis= Images showing the expansion of the light echo of V838 Monocerotis. Credit: NASA/ESA. The variable star V838 Monocerotis experienced a significant outburst in 2002 as observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. The outburst proved surprising to observers when the object appeared to expand at a rate far exceeding the speed of light as it grew from an apparent visual size of 4 to 7 light years in a matter of months. =Supernovae= Using light echoes, it is sometimes possible to see the faint reflections of historical supernovae. Astronomers calculate the ellipsoid which has the Earth and a supernova remnant at its focal points in order to locate clouds of dust and gas at its boundary. Identification can be done using laborious comparisons of photos taken months or years apart, and spotting changes in the light rippling across the interstellar medium. By analyzing the spectra of reflected light, astronomers can discern chemical signatures of supernovae whose light reached Earth long before the invention of the telescope and compare the explosion with its remnants, which may be centuries or millennia old. The first recorded instance of such an echo was in 1936, but it was not studied in detail. An example is supernova SN 1987A, the closest supernova in modern times. Its light echoes have aided in mapping the morphology of the immediate vicinity as well as in characterizing dust clouds lying further away but close to the line of sight from Earth. Another example is the SN 1572 supernova observed on Earth in 1572, where in 2008, faint light-echoes were seen on dust in the northern part of the Milky Way. Light echoes have also been used to study the supernova that produced the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. The light from Cassiopeia A would have been visible on Earth around 1660, but went unnoticed, probably because dust obscured the direct view. Reflections from different directions allow astronomers to determine if a supernova was asymmetrical and shone more brightly in some directions than in others. The progenitor of Cassiopeia A has been suspected as being asymmetric, and looking at the light echoes of Cassiopeia A allowed for the first detection of supernova asymmetry in 2010. Yet other examples are supernovae SN 1993J and SN 2014J. =Cepheids= ESO's VLT Survey Telescope . Light echoes were used to determine the distance to the Cepheid variable RS Puppis to an accuracy of 1%. Pierre Kavella at the European Southern Observatory described this measurement as so far \\"the most accurate distance to a Cepheid\\". =Nova Persei 1901= In 1939, French astronomer Paul Couderc published a study entitled \\"Les Auréoles Lumineuses des Novae\\" (Luminous Haloes of the Novae). Within this study, Couderc published the derivation of echo locations and time delays in the paraboloid, rather than ellipsoid, approximation of infinite distance. However, in his 1961 study, Y.K. Gulak queried Couderc's theories: \\"It is shown that there is an essential error in the proof according to which Couderc assumed the possibility of expansion of the bright ring (nebula) around Nova Persei 1901 with a velocity exceeding that of light.\\" He continues: \\"The comparison of the formulas obtained by the author, with the conclusions and formulas of Couderc, shows that the coincidence of the parallax calculated according to Coudrec's scheme, with parallaxes derived by other methods, could have been accidental.\\" Quasar light and ionisation echoes A Hubble Space Telescope image of NGC 5972, a quasar ionisation echo. Within the last decade, objects known either as quasar light echoes or quasar ionisation echoes have been investigated. A well studied example of a quasar light echo is the object known as Hanny's Voorwerp (HsV). HsV is made entirely of gas so hot — about 10,000 Celsius — that astronomers felt it had to be illuminated by something powerful. After several studies of light and ionisation echoes, it is thought they are likely caused by the 'echo' of a previously-active AGN that has shut down. Kevin Schawinski, a co-founder of the website Galaxy Zoo, stated: \\"We think that in the recent past the galaxy IC 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar. Because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the Voorwerp, light from that past still lights up the nearby Voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100,000 years, and the galaxy's black hole itself has gone quiet.\\" Chris Lintott, also a co-founder of Galaxy Zoo stated: \\"From the point of view of the Voorwerp, the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off – it's this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe.\\" The analysis of HsV in turn has led to the study of objects called Voorwerpjes and Green bean galaxies.

The series was followed up by a two-part miniseries entitled Dynasty: The Reunion in October 1991. A Dynasty reboot premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017. Appearances Dynasty premiered on ABC on January 12, 1981, starring John Forsythe as millionaire oil tycoon Blake Carrington for the entire run of the series. The drama centered on patriarch Blake and his wives, children, and extended family. The original run of Dynasty ended in May 1989. Dynasty: The Reunion, a miniseries to wrap up storylines left unfinished by the show's cancellation, aired in October 1991. A Dynasty reboot premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017, starring Grant Show as Blake and again focusing on him and his dysfunctional family. Storylines =Original series= As Dynasty begins in 1981, Carrington heirs Steven (Al Corley) and Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) return to Denver to attend the wedding of their father, powerful oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe), to his former secretary, Krystle (Linda Evans). The Carrington family dynamic is soon established; thoughtful and sensitive Steven resists his father's pressure to step into his role as future leader of Blake's empire, while his spoiled sister Fallon, better suited to follow in Blake's footsteps, is underestimated by and considered little more than a trophy to Blake. Steven befriends Krystle, who is adjusting to life at the mansion despite chilly receptions from Fallon and the Carrington majordomo, Joseph Anders (Lee Bergere). Blake's ex-wife Alexis (Joan Collins) appears in the second season and soon stirs up trouble for the family. In 1982, their infant grandson L.B. Colby, the son of Fallon and Jeff Colby (John James) is kidnapped. Former spouses Blake and Alexis make a televised plea that he be returned, and Alexis confesses a dark secret from their past: their firstborn son, Adam (Gordon Thomson), had been kidnapped as a baby and never recovered. Traumatized by the event, they had hidden his existence from their subsequent children Fallon and Steven. Meanwhile, in Billings, Montana, an old woman named Kate Torrance tearfully tells her grandson Michael that he is really the Carrington heir. Armed with items from Adam Carrington's baby carriage, lawyer \\"Michael\\" comes to Denver and is eventually accepted as a Carrington, but his selfishness, greed and ambition put him at odds with all of his relatives at one time or another. Steven leaves town that year and is presumed dead in an oil rig explosion in 1982; he turns up alive and returns (portrayed by Jack Coleman) in 1983. Fallon leaves town in 1984 and is also later presumed dead in a plane crash. At the same time, chanteuse Dominique Deveraux (Diahann Carroll) comes to Denver and soon makes a shocking claim: she is the daughter of Blake's father Tom Carrington (Harry Andrews) and his longtime mistress. Later in 1984 a young woman named Amanda Bedford (Catherine Oxenberg) appears on Alexis's doorstep; she is Alexis's youngest daughter, and it is eventually revealed that Blake is her father. Blake and Krystle also have a daughter, Krystina (Jessica Player), in 1984. Fallon reappears in 1985 (portrayed by Emma Samms). Alexis brings Blake's vengeful, estranged brother Ben (Christopher Cazenove) to town in 1986 to help her destroy Blake, and Ben's daughter Leslie (Terri Garber) soon follows in 1987. Ben leaves town that year after reconciling with Blake, and Leslie having reconciled with Ben follows suit in 1988 after a failed romance with Clay Fallmont (Ted McGinley), who is possibly also Ben's child. =Reboot series= In 2017, wealthy siblings Steven (James Mackay) and Fallon Carrington (Elizabeth Gillies) arrive in Atlanta to meet their father's fiancée, Cristal Flores (Nathalie Kelley). Fallon and Cristal set themselves as rivals for Blake's attention, but over time they find common ground over their frustration with his machinations. In the 2018 episode \\"I Answer to No Man\\", Blake (Grant Show) reveals to Cristal that he and his first wife had another son, Adam, who was kidnapped at six months old and never returned. Blake's ex-wife Alexis (Nicollette Sheridan), Steven and Fallon's mother, reappears in the \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\" after an extended exile. Alexis tells Steven about Adam, and Steven eventually finds his brother in El Paso, living under the name Hank Sullivan (Brent Antonello). Blake welcomes Adam back in \\"Trashy Little Tramp\\", not knowing that Hank is actually Alexis' lover with whom she is conspiring to amass enough Carrington Atlantic shares to seize control of the company. At the same time, Jeff (Sam Adegoke) and Monica Colby (Wakeema Hollis) learn from their grandmother—the former secretary of Blake's father, Thomas Carrington—that their mother, Millie, was fathered by Thomas. Jeff and Monica reveal their Carrington heritage in \\"Dead Scratch\\"—though Blake is already aware of his half-sister—and declare their intention to force a sale of Carrington Atlantic. In season two, Blake falls in love with Cristal Jennings (Ana Brenda Contreras). Fallon visits her cousin Juliette Carrington (), the French daughter of Blake's disinherited brother Benjamin. Steven is revealed to be the son of Alexis and Anders (Alan Dale) in \\"The Butler Did It\\". The real Adam (Sam Underwood) also reappears, and is immediately welcomed into the family by Blake, though Fallon is wary of him. Blake's half-sister and Jeff and Monica's mother, now going by the name Dominique Deveraux (Michael Michele), appears in \\"New Lady in Town\\". Blake marries Cristal (now Daniella Alonso) in season three.

By profession, he is a mathematician, computer programmer, and chess journalist.  Early years  Deen Hergott learned chess in his hometown of Kitchener, Ontario, and by his mid-teens was approaching National Master strength. He was selected to play for Canada at the World U26 Team Championship, Graz 1981. Hergott won the Junior Canadian Chess Championship, 1981–82, and represented Canada in the 1982 World Junior Chess Championship at Copenhagen, scoring a respectable 6/13. Hergott studied mathematics at the University of Waterloo, graduating with an honours bachelor's degree in 1986. He also successfully represented the University in team chess competition, for example at the Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship, held in Kitchener, 1984, where he played board one. The World Chess Federation (FIDE) awarded him the FM title in 1988, and the International Master title in 1991. Hergott played in the Toronto Closed in 1981, 1982 and 1987, but moved to Ottawa after that, and has resided there since.  Canadian Olympian  Hergott was chosen for the Canadian Olympiad team for Thessaloniki 1984, the first of his seven national selections. He was on the second reserve board, and scored 1/3. For Dubai 1986, he was on board four, and scored 6/10. At Thessaloniki 1988, he was first reserve, and scored 5/9. For Novi Sad 1990, he was again first reserve, and scored an undefeated 7/9 to win the bronze medal on that board. For Manila 1992, he was on board three, and made 5.5/10. At Moscow 1994, he ascended to board two, and scored 6.5/11. Not selected in 1996, he returned on board four at Elista 1998, and scored 5.5/11. His aggregate over seven Olympiads is 36.5/63 (+26 =21 -16), for 57.9 per cent, according to olimpbase.org. Hergott made his first appearance in the Closed Canadian Chess Championship at Winnipeg 1986, also a Zonal year, where he scored 6.5/15 in a strong field. He tied for third the next year in the Closed at Baie-Comeau, with 5.5/9. He played in the British Championship, Swansea 1987, scoring 6/11 in a powerful field headed by Grandmaster Nigel Short; Canadian Masters, as Commonwealth citizens, are eligible to play in the British Championship. The next Canadian Zonal was Windsor 1989, where he made an even score with 7.5/15. He tied for fourth in the 1992 Zonal at Kingston, with 6.5/11. His best Zonal performance was Hamilton 1994, where he finished clear second, with 10.5/15, a point behind Grandmaster Kevin Spraggett. In the controversy-marred Closed at Ottawa 1995, Hergott tied for third place with 5/8. Hergott placed seventh in the 1996 Zonal at Toronto with 8/15.  International successes  Hergott has achieved some significant successes in international events outside Canada. At the strong Linares 1993 round-robin in Mexico, he tied for third with 9.5/15. That same year in an International Open at Sitges, Spain, he tied for first with 7/9, along with Liuben Spassov and Luis Comes Fabrego. Perhaps the best result of his career was a clear first place at the 1994 Marshall Enhance tournament in New York, with 7/10. Hergott tied for first place in the 1995 Canadian Open Chess Championship in Toronto with 8/10. A few weeks later, he shared first at the North Bay International Open on 6/8, along with Bent Larsen and Alexandre Lesiege (En Passant magazine, October 1995, p. 13). The next year in 1996, at the Canadian Open in Calgary, he tied for third with 7.5/10. In a very strong field in the Canadian Open at Winnipeg 1997, Hergott made 7/10 to finish tied for 9th place. At home in Ottawa for the Canadian Open in 1998, Hergott made a fine 7.5/10 to tie for fifth place. Later in 1998 at the North Bay International Open, Hergott tied for sixth with 6/9. At home in Canada, Hergott has won the Grand Prix series championship for the Eastern Ontario Chess Association nine times, and has been victorious in several dozen weekend tournaments in Eastern Canada, often with dominant scores, including several perfect scores. Included among the perfect scores were a 7/7 to win the RA Club Championship in 1997, and a 5/5 to win the Ottawa / Hull Championship in 1998. Hergott reached his peak Canadian rating of 2580 in 1995, and this is the third highest ever recorded, behind only Grandmasters Kevin Spraggett and Alexandre Le Siege. His International rating crested at 2485 around the same time.  Health problems, semi-retirement  Hergott's health problems in the early 2000s (decade) prevented further progress towards the Grandmaster title, and he has been virtually retired from serious play for several years, since 2002. Hergott did return to captain the victorious Ottawa team to a win in the Four Cities' Chess'n Math Association 20th Anniversary event, held in Kingston, 2005, where Ottawa defeated all-Master teams from Toronto, Montreal, and Quebec City. He won the RA Spring Open in March 2007, and served as live games commentator at the 2007 Canadian Open Chess Championship at Ottawa.  Writings, style  Hergott became the chess columnist for the well-respected Ottawa Citizen newspaper in 1994, and has held that post since. His weekly Saturday column features an annotated game from either Canadian or international play, along with some news and insightful commentary. Hergott has been a successful writer for Canada's national chess magazine Chess Canada, with his topics having included instruction by annotating amateur games, international tournament reports, and intensive master games analysis. Hergott is also a ranked Master in bridge and a rated expert in Scrabble. Hergott's chess style tends to be tactical in nature, sometimes exceptionally sharp. It encompasses a wide range of openings. He can play solidly, or tend on occasion towards the bizarre; this makes him difficult to prepare for. He sometimes favours unusual defences with the Black pieces; these have included the Modern Defence, Owen's Defence, and the English Defence. From the late 1980s, he had success against strong competition with a highly eccentric, virtually unbooked Modern Defence line, which has been also variously named the Dutch Benoni, the Dzindzhi-Indian (for Grandmaster Roman Dzindzichashvili), and the Beefeater; the line runs 1.d4 g6 2.c4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5 4.d5 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3 f5!? With the White pieces, Hergott has mostly favoured the Closed openings. There is a selection of 550 of his games at chessbase.com.

He claimed to be a descendant of the Hudid dynasty which ruled the Taifa of Zaragoza until 1118. After being decisively defeated by a Christian coalition at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, Almohad control over al-Andalus entered terminal decline. Ibn Hud began a rebellion in May 1228, quickly winning popular support and defeating the governors of Murcia and Valencia. Meanwhile, the Almohad caliph Idris al-Ma'mun was forced to depart Seville with his remaining soldiers to defeat his nephew and rival Yahya in Marrakesh, allowing Ibn Hud to seize most of al-Andalus relatively unopposed, except Valencia, where he was opposed by Zayyan ibn Mardanish. Seeking to legitimise his rule, Ibn Hud pledged allegiance to the Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad and took the titles of Amir al- Mu'minin and al-Mutawwakil ('he who relies [on God]'). However, in 1231 his troops were decisively defeated by the Kingdom of Castile in the Battle of Jerez, and by the Kingdom of León near Mérida. These defeats lost him support and earned him the nickname 'the Deprived'. In 1232 Muhammad I of Granada elevated himself to sultan of in the region of Jaén and soon became Ibn Hud's most powerful opponent, forcing him to sign a truce with Castile. Though Ibn Hud was at first able to defeat Ibn Nasr in 1234, he was not able to protect Córdoba from being taken over by Ferdinand III of Castile in 1236, and had to sign another truce with both Ferdinand III and Ibn Nasr. In 1237, Granada accepted Ibn Nasr as its ruler. Ibn Hud was assassinated in January 1238 at the gates of Almería and was buried in Murcia.  References  Bibliography * Meri, Josef W.

It is a common feature of hypochondriasis and is commonly found with fibromyalgia, major depressive disorder, some anxiety disorders, Asperger syndrome, and alexithymia. One common clinical measure of SA is the Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SSAS). It is unclear whether persons with SA have a truly increased physiological sensitivity to bodily sensations. One study paradoxically found lower levels of SA in hypochondriacs who reported being constantly aware of their own heartbeats. Tentative electroencephalography results tend to indicate SA is more likely due to differences in long-latency cognitive processing, rather than objective physiological differences in sensitivity. It is not currently known whether SA causes or is caused by any of these conditions, only that they are comorbid conditions. One small study did find that, in patients with depression, SA may be part of the depression (i.e., treating the depression reduced the SA).

In 1663 he erected (or restored) the church font, and there may be a misunderstanding on this account. He also appears to have become Chaplain to the King in 1663, perhaps another cause of confusion. In 1666 he founded two almshouses at Ackworth. He resigned from his livings in 1672 and died on 10 October 1673.

The four-lane bridge crosses the upper Rhine north of the cities of Ludwigshafen and Mannheim in an east-west direction on the motorway connecting Saarbrücken, Kaiserslautern, Mannheim, and Viernheim. The length of the entire span, which consists of the main river span and two land spans, is over a kilometer long. The land span on the western side is somewhat longer, because the west bank is flatter than the east. The bridge construction began in 1938. On 12 December 1940 a major accident occurred when the frame collapsed. The construction was then suspended because of the Second World War. Work on the bridge resumed in 1948 and was completed in 1964. The bridge has no shoulders along the roadway which results in kilometer-long traffic jams during maintenance work and after accidents.

An independent advisory board representing regional businesses led by two co- chairs and a project manager provides leadership and direction to the Port Alberta network. Network Port Alberta's network comprises * roads, rail, runways and marine; * a foreign trade zone; * innovation technology; * professional services; * logistics and manufacturing facilities; and * the Edmonton International Trade Program. Foreign Trade Zone Port Alberta’s Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) enables companies involved in handling or moving goods to reduce and eliminate normal trade barriers, such as tariffs, quotas and compliance costs. Within the FTZ, located at the EIA, a company imports raw materials or partially finished goods, completes manufacturing and exports the products throughout Canada, North America or internationally.  History  =Pre-2010= Port Alberta was inspired by the Port of Houston, a one-stop shop for customs and security with a free trade zone and with air, rail and trucking connections in one place. In 2007, Edmonton Airports, the EEDC, and the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce signed a memorandum of understanding to create an inland port at the EIA. The federal government provided C$1.5 million in funding to the Port Alberta inland trade and transportation hub project. =2010-2014= Logo of the industry-led Port Alberta from 2010 through 2014 In 2010, Port Alberta transitioned to an industry-led association from its government-based founders and a board of independent industry directors was established in November 2010. Port Alberta incorporated as a legal entity on December 2, 2012, independent of the EIA and was represented by an industry and government led board that acted as a single point of entry for a multipurpose community port system of inland ports connecting Alberta with the Port of Prince Rupert and the Port Metro Vancouver. Port Alberta members integrate various Canadian inland transportation hubs such as CentrePort Canada and the Global Transportation Hub while connecting the CANAMEX Corridor with the Asia Pacific Gateway, and Canada's Arctic and Northwest Territories. Port Alberta's location on the CANAMEX Corridor, established by the North American Free Trade Agreement, combined with proximity to Alberta's Industrial Heartland, and the Nisku Business Park places Port Alberta at the economic centre of Canada's energy industry. Port Alberta's geographical positioning and collaborative relationships extend business access to foreign trade zone benefits and a well-established network of highways, railways, air and sea connections to important regional and international markets, including Eastern Canada, Western Canada, the Canadian Arctic, the United States, Europe, Asia, and the rapidly expanding Mexican and Latin American markets. Port Alberta represents a multi-point inland port capacity exceeding 500,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 2013 with expansion in 2014 to approximately 800,000 TEUs. Port Alberta's board of directors during this timeframe consisted of private sector and government members representing Canadian National (CN), Canadian Pacific (CP), Edmonton Airports, Momentive, Stantec, Graham Construction, the City of Edmonton, PCL Construction, the City of Leduc, Symmetry, Inc., ONPA Architects, and Waiward Steel.

King Ogbidi Okojie with his ladies  Biography  According to Uromi lore, he was born in the seventh month of gestation, coming 14th in the line of succession to the Uromi throne. As an African monarch, he believed in his divine right to wield absolute power. Those beliefs motivated his opposition to British Rule, which led to his first exile to Calabar in 1900. In Nigeria, at the end of the nineteenth century, the old order was crumbling, yielding to the new British colonial system. After the Royal Niger Company transferred its territories to the British government, the latter expanded and strengthened its control, unseating the traditional rulers. In 1900, Uromi was invaded by the British troops. Unlike Chief Nana Olomu of Brohimie-Warri, who opposed a strong resistance to the British troops when his domain was invaded, with 100 cannon, several shot-guns and over 5,000 slaves at his disposal, Okojie I, who had no modern weapons, but only Dane guns, bows and arrows, held out for six months, until he was betrayed by Iyahanebi, his \\"younger brother\\", and had to surrender to the British. As a consequence of his stiff resistance, in 1900 he was exiled to Calabar, where he met Oba Ovonramwen, late Oba of Benin, who had been exiled there by the British. He survived the ordeal in detention and returned home to be crowned the 14th Onojie of Uromi in 1900. Back home in Uromi, he adapted to the British system of government through \\"indirect rule\\", establishing his court at Ubiaja as the Divisional Supreme Judge. Still, he did not fully accept the new system of government, countering it with passive disobedience and maintaining his opposition to British rule. He kept governing his subjects as his forebears had always done, until he was deported again, this time to Benin, in 1918. His presence in Benin unsettled Oba Eweka II, the then ruling Oba, who objected to the British Resident at Benin against Okojie's presence there. In 1924, he was transferred to Ibadan. In 1926, he made a dramatic escape to Uromi,C.O. Aluede and A.A. Braimah op.cit. p.127 was arrested and taken back to Ibadan, until he was finally released in 1931. From 1931 until his death in 1944 he consolidated his power in Uromi. His first son Prince Uwagbale Okojie was crowned Onojie of Uromi in 1944. While alive, he was highly influential in Esan, Agbor and Benin City. In Esan he was the supreme judge of the criminal court that sat and tried murder cases at Agbede, Esan, Kukuruku (now known as Auchi) and Ologhodo (now Agbor). He built schools and supported higher learning. He built the roads from Uromi to Ilushi, Agbor and Ehor. When he died, he left behind an undisputed heir to the throne, glorious memories of life in exile and the fulfillment of his aspiration for renewed independence for black Africa and Nigeria. These prompted the Nigerian founding father Chief Anthony Enahoro, one of his many grandchildren, in to initiate the self-government motion in the Western House of Assembly in 1953, which eventually led to Nigerian Independence on the 1st day of October, 1960. A younger grandson is Peter Enahoro, revered pan-African journalist and author of How to be a Nigerian (1966). Other grandsons include Cardinal Anthony Okogie, the first Esan Cardinal, and Dr. Robert Okojie, a NASA scientist based in the U.S. Okojie I, the Onojie of Uromi, was survived by over sixty wives, over forty concubines, and innumerable children and grandchildren. He is still remembered by his people as Ogbidi the Uromi umbrella, the white son of Olokun, Okun the greatest native doctor that ever lived and ruled the native people of Uromi, who can turn into a girl, a lion or a leopard at will, the great doctor who can command the rain to fall and the air to stand still. Although he died many years ago, his legacy continues in many different parts of the world, from North America to Europe to Australia, where his grandchildren and great grandchildren currently reside.

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 24,966. Geography Lens is located on the left bank of the Lena River, at the southern edge of the Lena Plateau, approximately west of Yakutsk, the capital of the republic.Google Earth History The original settlement was founded as Mukhtuya () in 1663 by Russian fur traders, on the site of an older Evenk settlement known as Mukhtuy. The name of the original settlement was derived from an Evenk term meaning \\"great water\\". During the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a place of political exile. It experienced a period of rapid growth during the 20th century as a result of the discovery and development of diamond deposits in the Vilyuy River basin. As the closest significant settlement to the major kimberlite excavations at the Mir Mine and the establishment of the associated town of Mirny, Mukhtuya became a major base of construction. In 1956, roads were built connecting Mukhtuya to the future Mirny and the port was established. On July 13, 1963, Mukhtuya was granted town statusRegistry of the Administrative-Territorial Divisions of the Sakha Republic and was given its present name, after the river on which it stands. In May 2001, Lensk briefly came to the world's attention when almost the entire town was flooded and a large amount of the buildings destroyed. The floods were caused by river ice blocking the river downstream, creating a dam. The town was largely rebuilt after the flooding. Lensk after the 2001 flood Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Lensk serves as the administrative center of Lensky District. As an inhabited locality, Lensk is classified as a town under district jurisdiction. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Lensky District as the Town of Lensk. As a municipal division, the Town of Lensk is incorporated within Lensky Municipal District as Lensk Urban Settlement.Law #173-Z #353-III Economy In addition to its association with the diamond industry and construction, Lensk has a significant forestry and timber sector and a large- panel housing factory. The town is also home to the Yakutalmaz scientific research organization. Lensk is connected with Mirny by road and has scheduled air connections with Mirny, Yakutsk, and Irkutsk from the Lensk Airport. As a major port on the Lena, the town has developed as a processing point for the regional diamond industry. Culture and tourism Lensk has a history museum and operates a branch of the Irkutsk Polytechnic Institute. A karst cave with a waterfall and a karst lake is located southwest of the town.

Description An eccentric hub scooter An eccentric-hub scooter is a vehicle similar to a kick scooter, with a large rear wheel, mounted off-centre. The vehicle is propelled by the user bouncing up and down or rocking backwards and forwards on the platform to drive the rear wheel around the eccentric hub. One early inventor described the vehicle as a 'galloping scooter' and the rider's motion does resemble a horse-rider's motion. Although the motion produced is impact-free, it is reportedly less efficient than a conventional bicycle and will not propel the vehicle uphill. History =Exercycle / Ingo-Bike= Ingo-bike Although several patents for eccentric-hub cycles exist from 1928 Richard Rutherford's Scooter Patent https://www.google.com/patents/US1664864 Rollie Faegol's \\"Galloping Scooter\\" Patent https://www.google.com/patents/US1679819 , the most popular incarnation was made from 1934 by brothers Phillip and Prescott Huyssen and called the \\"Exercycle\\" Huysens' Self-Propelling Vehicle Patent https://www.google.com/patents/US2125568 . It was produced by the Ingersoll Steel & Disc Co. (a division of Borg-Warner Corp.), from 1934–1937, under the name \\"Ingo-bike\\". A large number of publicity events and promotions popularised the bike and a group of Ingo-bikers in the late 1930s traveled from Chicago to Miami in 30 days. Production ceased when the factory re-tooled to begin producing armaments prior to the Second World War. Phillip Huyssen continued designing variations until at least the 1970s. In the Three Stooges movie Yes, We Have No Bonanza , Curly rides up to a saloon bar on an Ingo- Bike. Curly on an Ingo-Bike from Yes, We Have No Bonanza https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36kD4m7duEE =Kangaroo Scooter= Apparently re-introduced as a children's scooter in the 1960s with the name \\"kangaroo scooter\\", kangaroo scooters were built in Taiwan for a company based in Concord, California. They had the eccentric rear wheel and a front caliper brake,chrome fenders and a kickstand. Another device also called the Kangaroo Scooter has been designed and sold by Ron and Johnny Knox's company, Knoxcooter Inc., of Weyburn, Saskatchewan, Canada since around 2004. This variant includes a one-sided rear wheel support, disk brakes and uniquely a clutched rear hub; which allows the user to coast for periods without bouncing up and down. Contrary to popular belief, the Eco-Fav (Frequency Accelerated Velocipede) scooter is efficient enough to ride uphill. Many users prefer to ride it on an incline to increase their workout resistance.

The office was renamed to Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement after the 2006 election. He is involved in controversial plans to allow possession of pornographic material involving people between 14 and 18, created and used exclusively by the participants. However, there is no plan to change the existing law (Hungarian Penal Code 195/A. §) that prohibits people over 18 to take, share or circulate pictures of people under 18, therefore much of the controversy derives from misinformation. During his ministership, the 2006 protests took place in Hungary, which were a series of anti- government protests triggered by the release of Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány's private speech in which he confessed that his Hungarian Socialist Party had lied to win the 2006 election, and had done nothing worth mentioning in the previous four years of governing. Most of the events took place in Budapest and other major cities between 17 September and 23 October. After the siege of the Magyar Televízió building (18 September 2006), Petrétei resigned but Gyurcsány disclaimed his decision. On 20 May 2007, Gyurcsány announced the resignations of József Petrétei, National Police Chief László Bene and Budapest Police Chief Péter Gergényi. Gyurcsány said the move is intended to restore public confidence in Hungary's police and justice systems.

It begins at the Nebraska border north of Merriman, Nebraska, as a continuation of Nebraska Highway 61. It runs to the North Dakota border, where it continues as North Dakota Highway 49. It is just more than in length. History When designated in the 1920s, South Dakota 73 only consisted of the segment from Faith (U.S. Route 212) to Lemmon (U.S. Route 12). The remainder of the route was unnumbered. Around 1935, SD 73 was extended south from Faith, absorbing what had been a portion of South Dakota Highway 24 to near Plainview, then southeast via a new route to Philip. From there, it was concurrent with U.S. Highway 16 to Kadoka then southward along what had been South Dakota Highway 63. It continued south to the Nebraska border south of Martin, after sharing an alignment with U.S. Highway 18. Except for minor route straightening and a new concurrency with Interstate 90, this route has not changed since. Around 1979, the northern terminus was extended east along U.S. 12 to Thunder Hawk, where it met up with a new road to link with ND 49.

She is also an active conductor, teacher and producer. Biography Bouchard was born in Montreal, Quebec, and was raised in Montreal, Quebec. She has a BA in music (Bennington College, Vermont, 1979) and an MMus in composition (Manhattan School of Music, New York City, 1982). Her teachers were Ransom Wilson, Sue Ann Kahn, Harvey Sollberger (flute), David Gilbert and Arthur Weisberg (conducting), and Elias Tanenbaum, Ursula Mamlock and Henry Brant (composition). She has cited Henry Brant as a major influence in her music. She has experimented with different spatial placements of performers, both as a composer and as a conductor. Her music is characterized by timbral explorations and percussive explosions. Bouchard went to the U.S. in 1977 to study composition with Henry Brant. She lived in New York City from 1979 to 1990, where she composed, led new music ensembles, and made orchestral arrangements for The Washington Ballet, Orchestra of St. Luke’s, and various churches in the New York metropolitan area. She was Assistant Conductor for New York Children's Free Opera from 1985 to 1988 and guest-conducted the Orchestra of St. Luke's, the American Dance Festival, the New York New Music Ensemble and others. In 1991, Bouchard returned to Montreal in time for the world premiere of her composition “Elan” with l’Orchestre Métropolitain. She was composer-in-residence from 1992 to 1995 with the National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa, Canada. In 1997, she moved to San Francisco, where she currently resides with her husband and son. In 1999, Bouchard received first prize for “Composer of the Year” from le Conseil Québecois de la Culture and the Joseph S. Stauffer Prize from the Canada Council for the Arts. Her works received five PROCAN and SOCAN awards. Her honors in the U.S. include first prizes from the Princeton Composition Contest, the Indiana State Competition, and the National Association of Composers USA Contest and a Fromm Music Foundation Award from Harvard University. In 2005, Bouchard founded New Experimental Music, Art and Production (NEXMAP), a nonprofit arts organization that explores the intersection of traditional artistic practices and new technologies. She served as artistic director until December 2015. That year she received a Fleck Fellowship Award at the Banff Center and was also invited as a Master Instructor in their Music Workshop Program. Bouchard was a Visiting Professor at UC Berkeley during the Spring 2016, Bouchard’s latest interdisciplinary projects include “All Caps No Space,” which has been performed in San Francisco, Vancouver and The Banff Centre for the Arts. She wrote a score for Detour Inc., a San Francisco–based startup that creates unique and innovative documentary tours all over the world. Her score is used for architecture tours in San Francisco, Berlin and London. In September 2017, Bouchard received a multiyear grant from the Canada Council for the Arts to “Research and Create\\". Her project titled “Live Structures” will unfold over the next two years with collaborations and partnerships with François Houle, Philippe Pasquier at Metacreation in Vancouver, Lori Freedman and Sandeep Bhagwati at Matralab in Montreal and with Kyle Bruckmann in San Francisco.

Morning, which first aired on April 8, 2007, on TV Tokyo and later throughout the country. The show was recorded in HD and starred Morning Musume members. Each member represented different animals living under the young and mildly despotic ruler of the fictional Kingdom of Haromoni, , whose name derives from the Japanese word for . The final episode aired on September 28, 2008.  Concept  Haromoni marked a departure from its predecessor and related Hello! Project productions in that it was shot exclusively outdoors and was composed of a series of connected segments. In the first ten episodes, the show followed the form of a relatively cohesive narrative, detailing the weekly accomplishment of a specific task. The tasks generally consisted of delivering a given piece of hardware used in commerce and industry on behalf of King Akachin. Thereafter, the show focused primarily on several distinct characters, including , , and . Morning Musume members were usually split into two groups who then challenged other Japanese celebrities to compete in a series of one or more games for each character. In the episode 'Lying Queen', for example, four Musume members faced off against a celebrity artist in a game to determine which of them was lying about a given subject (past gastronomic experiences, among others). At one point, a third group, consisting of Koharu Kusumi and Aika Mitsui, visited Chinese restaurants and events related to China in order to learn more about Eighth Generation members Junjun and Linlin's home country. Other challenges included creating an exclusive character design for the Kirarin Revolution anime series. Members were asked to draw the design for Tsukishima Kirari's pet cat Nā-san's antagonist. Sayumi Michishige's youma-inspired design was chosen from the submitted works.  Segments  From the January 27, 2008 episode until the April 27, 2008 episode, Haromoni@ had consisted of only a \\"MouTube\\" segment and occasionally a studio performance. * Lying Queen (2007-07-29 - 2007-11-25) * Little King (2007-07-29 - 2007-12-09): This segment features a young child or young children who have special talents. The children show their talents and often challenge Morning Musume in the talent, with Morning Musume being required to complete much simpler tasks. The winner of the challenge is rewarded with a gourmet dessert. * Hit Jack (2007-08-05 - 2007-09-02) * Child Gourmet Joker (2007-09-30 - 2007-10-28) * Collab Musume (2007-10-07 - 2007-12-09) * Equal Viking (2007-11-18 - 2008-01-20): Morning Musume members and several guests are seated around a circular table upon which certain dishes are placed. The girls and guests must each take a certain amount of food, until it is all gone. Each person's plate is then weighted to meet a certain quota. If the weight does not land within the required amount, the food is taken from them. * MouTube (2008-01-13 - 2008-09-28): This segment features videos from fans around the world that submitted their videos to Morning Musume. It also features Memory Battles, GakiKame Theater and the Morning Musume members portraying different roles doing different things.

He was born to the family of a low-ranking samurai. He studied with Maruyama Ōkyo in Kyoto.Discovering the Arts of Japan: A Historical Overview by Tsuneko S. Sadao, Stephanie Wada, and Tomoko Miho (2003) p.214  Biography  There are conflicting versions of Rosetsu's family origins, but the most credible appears to be that he was born to the family of a low-ranking samurai named Uesugi Hikouemon in the area of modern Kyoto Prefecture. Upon establishing himself as an artist, he changed his name from Uesugi to Nagasawa. He moved to Kyoto in 1781, where he became a student of Maruyama Ōkyo. Rosetsu was married and had four children, all of whom died in childhood. He adopted his pupil Nagasawa Roshū. Rosetsu, his children, and his pupil are buried in a Kyoto cemetery belonging to the Pure Land Sect, although Rosetsu was a lay student of Zen.  Works  Rosetsu's early period works are in the style of Maruyama Ōkyo, although critics agree that the pupil's skill quickly surpassed his master's. Finally, they had a falling out and Rosetsu left the school. After the break, he worked under the patronage of the feudal lord of Yodo and accepted commissions at several temples. > Rosetsu's paintings fall into two very clearly defined categories, with no > halfway stage in between. On the one hand, there are those of studied > finish, and on the other, those--the great majority--that were clearly the > work of a very few minutes of intense activity, whatever the preliminary > thought and calculation.

History The fortress of Charsianon (Greek: Χαρσιανόν κάστρον, Charsianon kastron; Arabic: Qal'e-i Ḥarsanōs) is first mentioned in 638, during the first wave of the Muslim conquests, and was allegedly named after a general of Justinian I named Charsios.. The fortress is now identified with the ruins of Muşali Kale in the Akdağmadeni district in Yozgat Province). The Arabs first seized it in 730, and it remained a hotly contested stronghold during the next century of Byzantine–Arab warfare. During the 8th century, it belonged to the Armeniac Theme and was the seat of a military and territorial district (tourma). In the early 9th century, the fortress became the centre of a kleisoura, a separately administered fortified frontier district. Sometime between 863 and 873, it was raised to the status of a full theme, augmented by territory from the neighbouring Bucellarian, Armeniac and Cappadocian themes.. It ranked in the middle tier of themes, with its governing strategos receiving an annual salary of 20 pounds of gold and commanding, according to Arab sources, 4,000 men and four fortresses. In the 10th century, the theme of Charsianon became a major stronghold of the landed military aristocracy, with the great clans of Argyros and Maleinos having their homes and estates there. After 1045, a large number of Armenians, including the former king Gagik II (r. 1042–1045), were settled there, leading to friction with the local Greeks. The theme was lost to the Seljuk Turks following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 and given to Danishmendids. Gagik II is attested as the last doux of Charsianon in 1072–1073.

In 1856 the priest in charge of the reduction calculated the number of resident natives as 3,000, and asked for a town to be established. The mission was moved to San Javier in 1857, and then again to its original site in 1860. In 1861 governor Pascual Rosas ordered the natives to be moved again to San Javier, but they rebelled and were split into three reductions: San Javier, Cayastá and Calchines.

The episode aired on December 8, 1973. Plot Captain Sam Pak (Pat Morita) and Dr. Sidney Freedman (Allan Arbus) arrive at the 4077th for a \\"conference\\" that is actually a marathon poker game in the Swamp, with Henry Blake, Hawkeye, Trapper, and Klinger. The game is subject to several interruptions. A wounded soldier is brought into the hospital, but Frank Burns refuses to operate on him as he is an intelligence officer; protocol dictates that a second such officer must be present before he can be anesthetized. Hawkeye and Trapper decide to operate immediately due to the serious nature of the man's injuries. CID officer Captain Halloran (Edward Winter) eventually arrives from headquarters, some time after surgery is over, and joins the game once Hawkeye assures him that the patient did not give away any classified information. Meanwhile, Radar hits an elderly local man while driving a jeep. The man is a con artist who fakes being hit by military vehicles in order to extort money from the drivers; the poker players contribute from their winnings to pay him off, over Halloran's objection. Private Carter (John Ritter) grows increasingly agitated and antagonistic toward the doctors while recovering in Post-Op, resenting Frank's gung-ho patriotism most of all. Carter eventually snaps, grabs a pistol, and holds Frank hostage in the shower tent until Trapper sneaks in and disarms him. Notes Generally considered one of the best episodes of the series, \\"Deal Me Out\\" marks the first of Edward Winter's eight appearances on M*A*S*H. In all subsequent appearances, he portrayed Intelligence Officer Colonel Flagg. This first appearance—as Captain Halloran—is often cited by fans as the same character, with Halloran being one of Flagg's many aliases. In the fourth- season episode \\"Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?\\", Flagg's and Dr. Freedman's conversation refers to a previous poker game that the two had attended. In \\"What's Up, Doc?\\" it is Major Winchester who is taken hostage by an unstable patient, although Klinger soon trades places with Winchester.

The size of the cavities usually ranges between a few millimetres and 3 cm in diameter. Chapter 80 In the past, it was a mere histological curiosity occasionally found at autopsies, but has been increasingly recognised with wide-ranging conditions from AIDS to the use of anabolic steroids. It also occasionally affects spleen, lymph nodes, lungs, kidneys, adrenal glands, bone marrow, and other parts of gastrointestinal tract. Peliosis hepatis is often erroneously written \\"peliosis hepatitis\\", despite its not being one of the hepatitides. The correct term arises from the Greek pelios, i.e. discoloured by extravasated blood, livid, and the Latinized genitive case (hepatis) of the Greek hepar, liver. Presentation = Disease associations = *Infections: HIV, bacillary peliosis (caused by genus Bartonella, bacteria responsible for cat-scratch disease which are identified histologically adjacent to the peliotic lesions), Staphylococcus aureus *Chronic conditions: End stage kidney failure, kwashiorkor, tuberculosis, and other chronic infections *Malignancy: Monoclonal gammopathies (multiple myeloma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia), Hodgkin disease, malignant histiocytosis, seminoma, hepatocellular adenoma, and hepatocarcinoma * Kidney transplants: It can be found in up to 20% patients, can be related to azathioprine or cyclosporine use, and may be associated with increased risk of transplant rejection. *Drugs and toxins: Corticosteroids, androgens, azathioprine, tamoxifen  Pathophysiology  The CT scan of a patient with peliosis hepatis (left): The follow-up CT (right) after 7 years shows full remission. The pathogenesis of peliosis hepatis is unknown. Several hypotheses are given, such as it arises from sinusoidal epithelial damage, increased sinusoidal pressure due to obstruction in blood outflow from the liver, or hepatocellular necrosis. Two morphologic patterns of hepatic peliosis were described by Yanoff and Rawson. In the phlebectatic type, the blood-filled spaces are lined with endothelium and are associated with aneurysmal dilatation of the central vein; in the parenchymal type, the spaces have no endothelial lining and they usually are associated with haemorrhagic parenchymal necrosis. Some consider both patterns to be one process, initiated by focal necrosis of liver parenchyma, observed in parenchymal type, progressing into formation of fibrous wall and endothelial lining around haemorrhage of phlebectatic type. Fibrosis, cirrhosis, regenerative nodules, and tumours may also be seen.  Diagnosis The condition is typically asymptomatic and is discovered following evaluation of abnormal liver function test. However, when severe, it can manifest as jaundice, hepatomegaly, liver failure, and haemoperitoneum. Treatment Treatment is usually directed towards management of the underlying cause. Withdrawal of azathioprine leads to remission in kidney transplant; bacillary peliosis responds to antibiotics. In rare circumstances partial resection of liver or transplant may be required.

A cabildo () or ayuntamiento () was a Spanish colonial, and early post-colonial, administrative council which governed a municipality. Cabildos were sometimes appointed, sometimes elected; but they were considered to be representative of all land-owning heads of household (vecinos). The colonial cabildo was essentially the same as the one developed in medieval Castile. The cabildo was the legal representative of the municipality—and its vecinos—before the Crown, therefore it was among the first institutions established by the conquistadors themselves after, or even before, taking over an area. For example, Hernán Cortés established La Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz to free himself from the authority of the Governor of Cuba. The word cabildo has the same Latin root (capitulum) as the English word chapter, and in fact, is also the Spanish word for a cathedral chapter. Historically the term ayuntamiento was often preceded by the word excelentísimo (English: \\"most excellent\\") as a style of office, when referring to the council. This phrase is often abbreviated Exc.mo Ay.to History Cabildo of Salta, Argentina. The Castilian cabildo has some similarities to the ancient Roman municipium and civitas—especially in the use of plural administrative officers and its control of the surrounding countryside, the territorium—but its evolution is a uniquely medieval development. With the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the establishment of the Visigothic Kingdom, the ancient municipal government vanished. In many areas, seeking to escape from the political instability around them, people entrusted themselves to large landholders, exchanging their service for the landholder's protection, in a process that ultimately led to feudalism. (See also, Manorialism.) In areas where the old territoria survived, the Visigothic kings appointed a single officer, called either a comes or a iudice to replace the defunct municipia or civitates. After the Muslim conquest, the new rulers also appointed various judicial officers to manage the affairs of the cities. Qadis heard any cases that fell under the purview of Sharia law and sahibs oversaw the administration of the various other areas of urban life, such as the markets and the public order.O'Callaghan, A History of Medieval Spain, 30, 61-62, 142-143. The cabildo proper began its slow evolution in the process of the Reconquista. As fortified areas grew into urban centers or older cities were incorporated into the expanding Christian kingdoms of Portugal, León and Castile, kings (and sometimes local lords) granted the cities various levels of self-rule and unique sets of laws (the fueros) and made them the administrative center of a large terminus or alfoz, which was analogous to the ancient territorium. In general, municipal governments often consisted of a council (consejo) open to all the property-owning adult males of the city and a nobleman appointed to represent the king and organize the defense of the city and terminus. By the 13th century, these open councils proved unwieldy and were replaced by a smaller body, the cabildo or ayuntamiento consisting of set number of regidores (usually twenty-four in the largest cities) elected by the property owners in the city. These new bodies took their permanent form by the end of the 14th century. As part of the same process, a municipal council (the consell) with different attributes and composition also evolved in the neighboring Kingdom of Aragon during this period.O'Callaghan, A History of Medieval Spain, 269-271, 447, 593-596. Structure Vargas, José María; Cevallos García, Gabriel and others investigators. (1985) In theory, every municipality in the Spanish colonies in the Americas and the Spanish Philippines had a cabildo. Municipalities were not just the cities but included the surrounding lands. All lands were ultimately assigned to a municipality. Usually the cabildo made local laws and reported to the presidente (president) of the audiencia, who in turn reported to the viceroy. The cabildo had judicial, legislative and administrative duties. For this reason it was often addressed with the formula, Consejo, Justicia y Regimiento (Council, Justice and Government). Gerardo Flores Ivaldi Oil The cabildo consisted of several types of officials. There were four to twelve regidores, depending on the size and importance of the municipality. Regidores, were not just deliberative officers, but all shared in the administration of the territory, dividing tasks among themselves. Initially the regidores were elected by all the heads of household. In the late Middle Ages, these elections often turned violent, with citizens forming bands to control elections and even resorting to murder. To minimize this kings began to appoint a certain number of, or even all of, the regidores in certain cities. By the modern era different cabildos had different mixes of elected and appointed regidores both on the Peninsula and overseas. Finally, to add another layer of control, the kings introduced corregidores to represent them directly and preside over the cabildos. Although many municipalities lost their right to elect all or some of their regidores as time went on, cities and cabildos gained new power with the development of the Castilian and Leonese parliaments (the cortes) because cities had a right to representation in them.O'Callaghan, A History of Medieval Spain, 447. In addition to the council members, the cabildo had one or two magistrates, the alcaldes, whom the regidores elected every January 1. Alcaldes served as judges of first instance in all criminal and civil cases and acted as presiding officers of the cabildo, unless there was a corregidor. In provincial capitals the first alcalde would fill in for incapacitated governors. Other officers were the alférez real (royal standard-bearer), who had a vote in cabildo deliberations and would substitute the alcalde if the latter could not carry out the functions of his office; the alguacil mayor, who oversaw local law enforcement; the fiel ejecutor, who was the inspector of weights, measures and markets, in charge of the supplies of the city and oversaw municipal sanitation; the procurador or city attorney; and a scribe. After the Bourbon Reforms, peninsulares were almost exclusively appointed to the positions of viceroy and bishop. Other offices, such as oidores of the audiencia, corregidores (in the places where it continued to exist after the Bourbon Reforms) and intendants, also saw a rise in the proportion of peninsulares being appointed. These last ones had been positions to which creoles once had easy access, especially after the approval of the sale of offices which began during the financial crisis at the end of the 16th century. As a result of being shut out of these offices, creoles turned to the cabildos for political power. Soon enough cabildos became the center of power for creoles, as evidenced in many of the clashes, usually with the peninsular-dominated audiencias, in the period leading up to the wars of independence. In the first decades of the national period, the traditional form of the cabildo was kept in several Spanish American nations, although they were eventually replaced by legislative municipal councils. Currently existing Because cabildos were the city government, the city administrative offices were often called the \\"cabildo\\". These names are preserved in parts of Latin America, and even in New Orleans. At present, cabildos exist only on the Canary Islands (cabildos insulares), one governing each island, and they are elected. Cabildos there resemble the consells insulars (island councils) of the Balearic Islands.

He is especially known for his roles as a police officer. Career Iftekhar was born in Jalandhar and was the eldest among four brothers and a sister. After completing his matriculation, Iftekhar did a diploma course in painting from Lucknow College Of Arts. Iftekhar had a passion for singing and was impressed with the famous singer Kundanlal Sehgal. In his 20s, Iftekhar travelled to Calcutta for an audition conducted by the music composer Kamal Dasgupta, who was then serving for HMV. Dasgupta was so impressed by Iftekhar's personality that he recommended his name to M. P. Productions as an actor. Iftekhar made his debut in the 1944 film Taqraar, which was made under the banner of Art Films-Kolkata. Many of Iftekhar's close relatives, including his parents and siblings, migrated to Pakistan during the partition. He would have preferred to stay in India, but rioting forced him to leave Calcutta. Along with his wife and daughters, he moved to Bombay, where they struggled to make ends meet. Iftekhar had been introduced to actor Ashok Kumar during his time in Calcutta and contacted him in Bombay, gaining a role in the Bombay Talkies movie Muqaddar (1950). Iftekhar acted in over 400 films in a career that spanned from the 1940s through to the early 1990s. Like many of the older character actors who populated the Bollywood universe of the 1960s and 1970s, Iftekhar had been a lead actor in his youth during the \\"golden age\\" of Bollywood, in the 1940s and 1950s. His roles ranged from father, uncle, great-uncle, grandfather, police officer, police commissioner, courtroom judge and doctor. He also did negative roles in Bandini, Sawan Bhadon, Khel Khel Mein and Agent Vinod. In the 1960s and 1970s, Iftekhar graduated to playing uncle, father, and what came to be his speciality: police inspector roles, doctor or senior advocate. Generally he played \\"sympathetic\\" characters but, on occasion, he played the heavy. One of his most memorable roles as a heavy was as Amitabh Bachchan's corrupt industrialist mentor in Yash Chopra's classic Deewaar (1975). Another of Iftekhar's classic roles was as the police inspector in Prakash Mehra's Zanjeer. It was a small part, but the scene where Iftekhar reprimands the near-hysteric Amitabh Bachchan for taking the law into his own hands is incredibly powerful. Another important role as a police officer was played by him in the 1978 hit film Don. Some of his major roles came in Rajesh Khanna films such as Joroo Ka Ghulam, Mehboob Ki Mehndi, The Train , Khamoshi, Safar, Raja Rani, Ittefaq, Rajput and Awam. Besides Deewaar and Zanjeer, Iftekar had character roles in many of the classics of 1960s, 1970s, 1980s Bollywood cinema: Bimal Roy's Bandini, Raj Kapoor's Sangam, Manoj Kumar's Shaheed, Teesri Manzil, Teesri Kasam, Johny Mera Naam, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Don, The Gambler (1971 film) and Sholay, to name but a few. Apart from Hindi films, he appeared in two episodes of the American TV series Maya in 1967 as well the English language films Bombay Talkie (1970) and City of Joy (1992). Personal life Iftekhar married Hannah Joseph, a Jew from Calcutta, who changed her name to Rehana Ahmed and died on 27 May 2013. They had two daughters.

United States Marines, fleeing the scene of a car bomb attack and ambush by Afghan militants, fired on people and vehicles surrounding them, according to initial reports killing as many as 19 civilians and injuring around 50 more. The exact casualty figures have not been firmly established. The United States Marine Corps conducted an internal inquiry from January 2008. In May that year it exonerated the Marine Corps unit, determining that it had acted \\"appropriately and in accordance with the rules of engagement\\". The report was condemned by the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, and by the United Nations mission in Afghanistan. Further revelations in 2010 led employees of Amnesty International and the International Bar Association to assert that there was prima facie, or superficial evidence that international humanitarian law had been violated, but could not speculate further without knowing the details of the inquiry. In 2008 all involved troops were issued Combat Action Ribbons and one gunner was issued a Purple Heart. In 2019 the Board for Correction of Naval Records recommended the platoon's Marine commander be retroactively promoted to lieutenant colonel with back pay, and criticized the 2007 senior commanders who failed to \\"respond appropriately to an enemy information operation and stand by the troops.\\" Sequence of events On 4 March 2007, Haji Ihsanullah, a member of Hezb-e Islami Khalis (or the Tora Bora Military Front, depending on source), drove a minivan laden with explosives into one of the vehicles making up a US military convoy, which included either three or six humvees. A US Marine was injured. Sources differ on whether or not hidden gunmen then also opened fire on the convoy. The US Marines fled the area, firing on some vehicles for between 6 and 16 miles while driving along the Afghan street. According to several witnesses and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, the US Marines' response to the car bombing included indiscriminate firing at passing civilians on the busy highway. They asserted that elderly men, women and children were killed. Akhtyar Gul, a local reporter who witnessed the shooting, claimed that the Marines sprayed civilians with machine gun fire even though the Marines were not under attack. These assertions would be disputed during the subsequent US Marine Corps court of inquiry. According to Associated Press and Afghan journalists, US troops confiscated photos and videos of the incident and its aftermath. A freelance photographer working for the Associated Press claimed that two Marines and a translator asked him: \\"Why are you taking pictures? You don't have permission.\\" Another photographer claimed that he had been told by US troops, through an interpreter: \\"Delete them [your photos], or we will delete you.\\" Afghan response The killings were followed by widespread protests across Afghanistan and drew sharp criticism from President Hamid Karzai. The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission's report asserted that: \\"In failing to distinguish between civilians and legitimate military targets, the US Marine Corps Special Operators employed indiscriminate force. Their actions thus constitute a serious violation of international humanitarian standards.\\" Aftermath Major General Frank Kearney, head of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), ordered the entire 120-member unit out of Afghanistan pending an investigation into the incident, and announced that there was no evidence supporting the Marines' story that they had come under fire. The unit's commander and senior officer were relieved of their duties on 3 April 2007 and reassigned to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. Kearney's order to have the unit depart Afghanistan was later found by the Department of Defense's Inspector General to be within his authority, and reasonable. Compensation payments of $2,000 each were paid to the families of those killed or wounded; overall more than fifty Afghans received compensation payments. Investigation and inquiry The shooting came under investigation by both Afghanistan and the United States. On 12 April 2007, an initial investigation headed by a United States Air Force colonel was conducted, endorsed by a United States Army general. It determined that the Marines used \\"excessive force when they killed civilians after a suicide bombing\\", and referred the case to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service for a criminal inquiry; the investigation occurred two months after the shootings, with investigators only able to study the site of the shooting for an hour. The New York Times of 20 April 2007 included an article asserting that the shooting was similar to the Haditha massacre. The Pentagon issued a formal apology for the incident on 7 May 2007. \\"This was a terrible, terrible mistake,\\" said US Army Colonel John Nicholson, \\"and my nation grieves with you for your loss and suffering. We humbly and respectfully ask for your forgiveness.\\" Nicholson commanded Task Force Spartan, whose area of operation as defined by ISAF Regional Command East included the area of the shooting. This was dismissed as premature by General James T. Conway, Commandant of the Marine Corps, who said: \\"I would just as soon that no one ... apologize or talk about 'terrible, terrible mistakes'.\\" James Mattis, then a Marine Corps lieutenant general, ordered a court of inquiry to be held. The court at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina formally investigated the incident in January 2008, hearing from more than 50 witnesses, including Afghans, over 17 days. Much of the testimony was characterized as \\"vague and contradictory\\". The four Marines who had fired their weapons did not testify—according to Declan Walsh, writing in The Guardian of London, \\"because they had not been granted immunity from prosecution\\". During the court of inquiry, Colonel Nicholson stated the Marines did not coordinate their operations with his command when conducting operations, and that the Marines' failure to remain at the scene of the attack amounted to failing to \\"preserve evidence\\", according to David Zucchino of the Los Angeles Times. Marines who had been present testified that they had been forced to leave the scene by a \\"complex ambush\\". One Marine testified that not all Marines in the convoy returned fire against those ambushing the convoy—return fire, he said, was limited to some gunners. This Marine elaborated that the gunners were ordered to cease fire some minutes later by a Marine captain. Testimony by Afghans, including an Afghan police lieutenant colonel, and a 1980s mujahideen commander, contradicted the testimony of the Marines. Nicholson testified that thirty minutes after US Marines left the area, other US troops arrived at the location of the minivan attack and found no dead or wounded Afghans. He speculated that this might be because Afghans collect and bury their dead quickly in line with Islamic tradition, but also acknowledged that Taliban insurgents often fake or exaggerate civilian deaths, stating \\"That's why it's so important for us to stay on the scene.\\" According to one of the Marines' defence lawyers, Mark Waple, an investigation by the US Navy estimated that the number of people killed was between five and seven, all adult men; Waple continued that despite the prior claims of massacred women and children, witness statements attested only to a wounded 16-year-old boy and a woman with an injured hand. In May 2008 the court of inquiry concluded that they had \\"acted appropriately and in accordance with the rules of engagement and tactics, techniques and procedures in place at the time in response to a complex attack.\\" Testimony to the inquiry was classified and not released, and the 12,000-page report was also unpublished. In March 2015, excerpts of the \\"key conclusions\\" were published in the Military Times. No criminal charges were brought, although \\"some officers\\" did receive an \\"administrative reprimand\\". The court of inquiry recommended judicial and/or administrative actions be taken upon two Marine captains and two enlisted Marines. The verdict infuriated the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. Kubra Aman, a member of the Afghan House of Elders from Nangarhar, said \\"I am very angry. This is too much.\\" The decision was also criticised by the United Nations mission in Afghanistan, whose spokesperson Aleem Siddique said \\"It is disappointing that no one has been held accountable for these deaths\\". The two Marine captains were later \\"cleared of wrongdoing\\", according to the Marine Corps Times. More than a year after the court of inquiry concluded, Marines involved received Combat Action Ribbons, and an injured turret gunner was awarded the Purple Heart. In 2010, Mark Ellis of the International Bar Association told Channel 4 News of the UK that based on documents released by WikiLeaks, \\"there is prima facie evidence from the military log that suggests the troops could be investigated for war crimes\\" but that legal hurdles would probably prevent a hearing before the International Criminal Court (ICC). Sam Zafiri of Amnesty International took a similar line, saying that \\"There is certainly prima facie evidence of violations of international humanitarian law ... It's not so much about whether an investigation into what happened at Jalalabad is re-opened, but rather publish what the US military did investigate, who they talked to, what were the results and how did they arrive at the decision they came to.\\" In March 2015, the Military Times published a series of articles about the incident, written by Andrew deGrandpre. Fred Galvin, who commanded the Marine unit at the time of the incident, said that despite being cleared by the court of inquiry, he and his men thought that their side of the story had not been properly publicised, and that they still felt they were stigmatised as a result of the accusations. Although cleared of wrongdoing, members of the unit were adversely effected by the perception of the event. =2019 Retroactive promotions= In January 2019, the Board for Correction of Naval Records (BCNR) reported that Major Fred Galvin (USMC retired) should be promoted to lieutenant colonel and given back pay. The Board found Galvin \\"was beset by a perfect storm of toxic officers,\\" following the false accusations of 2007. The Board found \\"The ambush of 4 March 2007 was not a tactical \\"misstep\\". The GUI found the convoy's response was irreproachable and found no fault relative to the Marines' conduct and performance. The only misstep was the inability or unwillingness of Senior U.S. leaders to respond appropriately to an enemy information operation and stand by the troops until competent evidence was gathered.\\" See also * Civilian casualties in the war in Afghanistan (2001–present) * Coalition casualties in Afghanistan * Command responsibility * International Security Assistance Force * Taliban insurgency References External links * Category:Conflicts in 2007 Category:2007 in Afghanistan Category:War in Afghanistan (2001–present) casualties Category:Civilian casualties in the War in Afghanistan (2001–present) Category:History of Nangarhar Province Category:Massacres in Afghanistan Category:Massacres in 2007 Category:March 2007 events in Asia Category:United States Marine Corps ","title":"2007 Shinwar shooting"},{"id":"10732060","text":"Bojacá is a municipality and town of the Western Savanna Province, Colombia in the department of Cundinamarca.

The wall has been described to have been four meters high and 80 centimeters thick. The Muisca fortress was said to be located strategically on the Bogotá savanna between Funza and Fusagasugá in the south and the road to the regions in the north (Boyacá and Santander) roughly on the site known today as Las Manas. Rituals were allegedly performed by the merchants and soldiers travelling through the valley on the road between Zipaquirá and Tabio.Román, 2008, p.289 It however remains unclear if this stone fortress was built in pre-Columbian time or after the Spanish conquest.Román, 2008, p.298 Supposedly at this site the vanguard of the conquistador army of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada first encountered the Muisca on March 23, 1537.

Background  It is not known when Dou Kang was born. His father was Dou Rongding (竇榮定),The Book of Sui refers to Dou Kang's father as Dou Rongding and had a full biography on Dou Rongding, but the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang gave Dou Kang's father's name as just Dou Rong (竇榮). Compare Book of Sui, vol. 39 with Old Book of Tang, vol. 61 and New Book of Tang, vol. 95 . who carried the Sui title of Duke of Chen. His mother was the Princess Ancheng, sister to Sui Dynasty's founder Emperor Wen. As the emperor's nephew, Dou Kang was treated well by Emperor Wen, and was a student at the imperial university in his youth. He also became a guard for Emperor Wen.  During the Sui dynasty  After Dou Rongding died in 586, Dou Kang inherited the title of Duke of Chen. He was then made the governor of Liang Province (梁州, roughly modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). Before his departing the capital Chang'an to report to Liang Province, Emperor Wen personally visited Dou Kang and Princess Ancheng. Later, when Princess Ancheng died, Dou Kang was said to be in much distress in mourning that he fainted several times, and Emperor Wen sent his servants to comfort Dou Kang. Thereafter, Emperor Wen recalled him to governmental service as the governor of Qi Province (岐州, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi), and then as the commandant at Youzhou (modern Beijing, Tianjin and northern Hebei). Dou developed a reputation for being generous and merciful, during these terms of service. In 604, Emperor Wen died—a death that traditional historians generally believe to be a murder ordered by his son and crown prince Yang Guang, although they admitted a lack of direct evidence. Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang. Immediately thereafter, another son of Emperor Wen, Yang Liang the Prince of Han, rebelled against Emperor Yang at Bing Province (并州, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Emperor Yang, for reasons not stated in historical accounts, suspected Dou of collaborating with Yang Liang and sent the general Li Zixiong (李子雄) rushing to You Province to arrest Dou and replace him. Li subsequently alleged that Dou had received letters from Yang Liang urging him to join the rebellion but had not reported them to Emperor Yang. However, after an investigation, Emperor Yang concluded that there was a lack of evidence that Dou collaborated with Yang Liang, but nevertheless removed him from governmental service and further stripped him of the title of Duke of Chen, bestowing that title on his younger brother Dou Qing (竇慶) instead. Dou Kang was friendly with another general, Li Yuan the Duke of Tang, the husband of a cousin of his. During the rebellion of the general Yang Xuangan in 613, when Li Yuan was commissioned with an army, it was said that Dou told Li, :Is it not that Yang Xuangan is providing you with an opportunity? The prophecies refer to the Li clan as the originator of the next emperor, and you can use this opportunity. This is a divine revelation. Li responded, \\"I will not be the start of a rebellion. Why do you speak in such daring terms?\\" Nevertheless, he kept Dou's suggestion in mind. Toward the end of Emperor Yang's reign, Dou was commissioned with an army at Lingwu to secure the northern border. After Li Yuan rebelled against Emperor Yang in 617 and subsequently captured Chang'an, declaring Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You the Prince of Dai emperor (as Emperor Gong), Dou submitted to him in spring 618, along with the several commanderies he controlled in the region.  During the Tang dynasty  Soon thereafter, Emperor Yang was killed in a coup at Jiangdu (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) led by the general Yuwen Huaji. When the news reached Chang'an, Li Yuan had Yang You yield the throne to him, establishing Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu. Dou Kang, who was then the minister of engineering, was given the additional title of Nayan (納言), the head of the examination bureau of the government and a post considered to be one for a chancellor. He often attended Emperor Gaozu in the palace. Emperor Gaozu referred to him as \\"brother,\\" and within the palace, he was referred to as \\"uncle.\\" In winter 618, Dou Kang was no longer Nayan, and was made a general. He soon assisted Emperor Gaozu's son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin in defeating a major enemy, Xue Rengao the Emperor of Qin. In 621, he also assisted Li Shimin in attacking Wang Shichong the Emperor of Zheng, and after Wang surrendered, nine officials were particularly honored at the imperial ancestors' temple, among them were Dou Kang and his cousin Dou Gui (竇軌); he was also given much material rewards. Later that year, during an imperial feast, Dou Kang died suddenly.  Notes  Sources * Old Book of Tang, vol. 61. * New Book of Tang, vol. 95. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 185, 186.

Football career Born in Strasbourg, Cobos started playing professionally with hometown club RC Strasbourg, helping it return to Ligue 1 in 1992. He had already played in the top flight in the 1988–89 season, his official debut coming on 30 July 1988 in a 0–1 away loss against Montpellier HSC. Afterwards, Cobos spent three-and-a- half years with Paris Saint-Germain FC, helping with 14 matches as the capital side won the league in 1994 and he was a more important part of the first-team unit in the following season, as they conquered the Coupe de France. Additionally, in the latter season, he played in all the games to help his team reach the last-four in the European Cup. He also helped them win the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, but he was not part of the squad for the final, and the 1995 Trophée des Champions.

T-PLL is a very rare leukemia, primarily affecting adults over the age of 30. It represents 2% of all small lymphocytic leukemias in adults. Other names include T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, \\"knobby\\" type of T-cell leukemia, and T-prolymphocytic leukemia/T-cell lymphocytic leukemia. Signs and symptoms People affected by T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia typically have systemic disease at presentation, including enlargement of the liver and spleen, widespread enlargement of the lymph nodes, and skin infiltrates. Due to the systemic nature of this disease, leukemic cells can be found in peripheral blood, lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, liver, and skin. A high lymphocyte count (> 100 x 109/L) along with low amounts of red blood cells and platelets in the blood are common findings. HTLV-1 serologies are negative, and serum immunoglobins are within normal limits with no paraproteins present. Causes It is postulated that the originating cell line for this disease is a mature (post-thymic) T-cell. Diagnosis =Morphology= In the peripheral blood, T-PLL consists of medium-sized lymphocytes with single nucleoli and basophilic cytoplasm with occasional blebs or projections. The nuclei are usually round to oval in shape, with occasional patients having cells with a more irregular nuclear outline that is similar to the cerebriform nuclear shape seen in Sézary syndrome. A small cell variant comprises 20% of all T-PLL cases, and the Sézary cell-like (cerebriform) variant is seen in 5% of cases. Marrow involvement is typically diffuse with morphology similar to what is observed in peripheral blood. In the spleen, the leukemic cell infiltrate both the red pulp and white pulp, and lymph node involvement is typically diffuse through the paracortex. Skin infiltrates are seen in 20% of patients, and the infiltrates are usually dense and confined to the dermis and around the skin appendages. =Immunophenotype= T-PLL has the immunophenotype of a mature (post-thymic) T-lymphocyte, and the neoplastic cells are typically positive for pan-T antigens CD2, CD3, and CD7 and negative for TdT and CD1a. The immunophenotype CD4+/CD8- is present in 60% of cases, the CD4+/CD8+ immunophenotype is present in 25%, and the CD4-/CD8+ immunophenotype is present in 15% of cases. =Genetic findings= Clonal TCR gene rearrangements for the γ and δ chains are typically found. The most frequent chromosomal abnormality is the inversion of chromosome 14, specifically inv 14(q11;q32). This is found in 80% of cases, while 10% of cases show a reciprocal translocation of chromosome 14 (t(14;14)(q11;q32)). Also, abnormalities of chromosome 8 are seen approximately 75% of patients, including idic (8p11), t(8;8)(p11-12;q12), and trisomy 8. Treatment Most patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia require immediate treatment. T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is difficult to treat, and it does not respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs. Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain patients: purine analogues (pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine), chlorambucil, and various forms of combination chemotherapy regimens, including cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP), etoposide, bleomycin (VAPEC-B). Alemtuzumab (Campath), an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options. In one study of previously treated people with T-PLL, people who had a complete response to alemtuzumab survived a median of 16 months after treatment. Some patients who successfully respond to treatment also undergo stem cell transplantation to consolidate the response. Prognosis T-PLL is an extremely rare aggressive disease, and patients are not expected to live normal lifespans. Before the recent introduction of better treatments, such as alemtuzumab, the median survival time was 7.5 months after diagnosis. More recently, some patients have survived five years and more, although the median survival is still low. Epidemiology About four men are diagnosed with this disease for every three women. Despite its overall rarity, it is also the most common type of mature T cell leukemia.

Walter seems to have been responsible for building the round tower on the motte, as in 1165 it caught fire and a stone tumbling from the battlements killed Earl Roger's last surviving brother Mahel de Hereford; Gerald of Wales claims that, while dying from the injury, Mahel repented of his previous persecution of the Bishop of St. Davids, which he blamed for his fate. Roger and his brothers were childless, so Brecknock passed first to their sister's husband, Philip de Braose, then to Eleanor de Braose, and so came under the control of her husband, Humphrey de Bohun. In September 1233 Walter's grandson, another Walter de Clifford, had a force of over 200 men defending the castle against his father-in-law Llywelyn ab Iorwerth. Walter had no son, only a daughter, Maud, who married John Giffard, and inherited the lands when Walter died in 1263. The land was divided between the two daughters of John and Maud, with Bronllys going to the youngest, Maud. North view of Bronllys Castle in 1740 Maud (the daughter) died in 1311, and Edward II gave the castle to Rhys ap Hywel (a local resident descendant of the former kings of Brycheiniog)Brecknock in S.Lewis, A Topographical Dictionary of Wales, London, 1849John Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, 1833-37, Volume 3, entry for Price, of Castle Madog as reward for loyalty to the crown. Rhys rebelled against the machinations of Edward's favourite and the king took back Bronllys; after Rhys helped depose Edward, being a member of the search party who seized him, he regained Bronllys. Bronllys was inherited by Rhys' son, Philip ap Rhys. Although Philip's brother, Einion Sais was a prominent military supporter of the new king, Edward III allowed himself to be persuaded by Humphrey de Bohun, Lord of Brecknock that a place like Bronllys should be ruled by a powerful magnate such as himself, rather than a weak one such as Philip, so Edward transferred the castle to Humphrey. Bronllys was inherited by Humphrey's nephew, Humphrey de Bohun. This Humphrey only had daughters, so when he died in 1373, the land was initially retained by his widow. Humphrey's titles and authority went into abeyance, and were disputed between the Duke of Gloucester, married to the older daughter, Eleanor, and Henry Bolinbroke, married to Mary de Bohun. After deposing Richard II, Henry used his royal authority and terminated the abeyance in Mary's favour, effectively transferring the lands to himself by jure uxoris in 1399.  Decline  Following the deposition and death of Richard II, the Glyndŵr Rising broke out in Wales. The castle was fortified against Owain Glyndŵr's forces, but Bronllys was never again occupied. Anne of Gloucester, daughter of Mary de Bohun's elder sister Eleanor, petitioned Henry for her grandfather's lands to be returned to her. Anne's son, and heir, Humphrey Stafford, inherited the Earldom of Buckingham from his uncle, and was raised to Duke as a reward for his loyalty to Bolinbroke's heirs. His grandson, Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, was suspected of plotting against King Henry VIII, and was subsequently executed for treason in 1521; Bronllys was forfeited to the crown, with which it has remained ever since. In 1521, the year the castle became a crown property, the antiquarian John Leland went to inspect it, reporting that it had fallen into great disrepair. By 1583 the disrepair was substantially worse. It is now in the care of Cadw, the arm of the Welsh Assembly charged with care of historic monuments and is open to the public between April and October.

He has directed and written a number of feature films while creating an animated television series for the Logo cable network. He also writes a column for The Advocate. Personal life Brocka was born and spent his childhood in Guam. His family moved to the mainland United States, settling in Parkland, Washington where he attended Washington High School. He earned a degree in communications from the University of Washington in Seattle and went on to get a Masters in film from the California Institute of the Arts. Brocka is of Filipino heritage and is openly gay. His uncle was Lino Brocka, a film director in the Philippines and an advocate for LGBT rights. Filmography and awards It was in Guam where Brocka first discovered film. At the age of eight he discovered it was fun to create simple slide shows from photographs with a soundtrack. At age nine his mother, a saleswoman for Panasonic, brought home a video camera and Brocka began creating short films and sketch comedy. He found an early fascination with science fiction but after seeing The Rocky Horror Picture Show and some John Waters films as a teen he realized sexuality was a legitimate subject. Also, while living in Seattle, he directed a queer public-access television show for several years. In 1999 the first of Brocka's films seen by the public was the animated short Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple In All The World, an irreverent story of a lesbian couple and gay couple who dislike each other, but decide to have a baby together. The short was done as a school project that Brocka then submitted to Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation. It went on to show and won awards at seven different film festivals. Brocka went on to create another short, Roberta Loved, a story of a morbidly obese woman who is fired from her job and learns she will die. Roberta Loved won another set of awards, and Brocka learned that his audience was willing to be disturbed by his subject matter, whether through humor (as in Rick and Steve) or drama (as in Roberta Loved and Seventy). His next works were iconic documentaries of popular culture, Porno Valley, a reality show featuring pornographic actresses from Vivid Entertainment and Camp Michael Jackson about the encampment of fans and media outside the court trial of pop- music star Michael Jackson. Brocka was approached by Ariztical Entertainment to create low budget gay romances and he agreed. For the first film, Eating Out, Brocka reached out to American Idol contestant Jim Verraros, who had never previously acted, as a co-star. It went on to win several awards, including 2004 Best Feature at the San Francisco International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival. Eating Out has spawned four sequels: 2006's Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds and 2009's Eating Out All You Can Eat, neither of which included Brocka's direct involvement, and Eating Out: Drama Camp and Eating Out: The Open Weekend, both from 2011, which Brocka directed and co-wrote, also serving as producer for the former. Boy Culture, Brocka's 2006 feature- length release, has won more than a dozen awards at film festivals around the world, including Best Writing at the 2006 Outfest and Best Feature Film at Festival del Mar in Spain. The Logo cable network later picked up Rick & Steve as an animated series, which aired from 2007 to 2009. Brocka also performed some of the show's voices. References External links * *Q.

It was once attached to the elementary school, Queen of Peace, but moved next door in the early 1990s into a new building. History In 1986, with the advent of full funding for Catholic Secondary education in Ontario, The Essex County Roman Catholic Separate School Board commissions Michael Haugh and Kevin Mulvey to study and implement the extension of secondary school education in Essex County. The result of their efforts saw the creation of two new Catholic Secondary schools in Essex County to take the pressure off the already overpopulated St. Anne Catholic High School in Tecumseh. Following the division of the County into three districts, two new Catholic High school sites were proposed, one for the Leamington area and one for the Lasalle area. Faith communities from Essex, Kingsville, Leamington, and Woodslee jumped on board by promoting the proposed idea of a Leamington-based Catholic Secondary School in their respective elementary feeder schools. Soon, Grade 8 Students from Holy Name in Essex, St. John de Brebeuf in Kingsville, St. John the Evangelist in Woodslee, and St. Louis/Queen of Peace in Leamington were being made aware of the possibility of attending a new Catholic High School in their area. The beginnings of this school were to be humble. Students coming on board were made aware that the first years of their high school experience would probably take place in a portable building setting, with a permanent structure to be built in the near future. In the fall of 1987, the decision was made by future staff and students to ask permission of Gerald Emmett Cardinal Carter, to use his name for the future Leamington area school. In the past, the Cardinal who was instrumental in the bid to bring full funding to Ontario had refused the offer to have his name used for a school. The Cardinal agreed to give his name when a letter arrived from the future students of CCCSS politely asking for the honor of using his name for their yet to be constructed school. The team mascot, chosen by a vote from the Grade 8 students registered, was to be \\"The Cougars.\\" School opened On 8 September 1987, Cardinal Carter Catholic Secondary School opened its doors using the gymnasium and changing rooms of Queen of Peace School as classrooms. On October 11 blessing and official opening of school was presided over by Gerald Emmett Cardinal Carter in person. By 1989, uniforms were introduced using the official school colors of gray and blue with red as an accent. The first grade 12 Graduation Ceremony took place at St. Joseph's Church in 1991. In the fall of 1991 construction began on a permanent home for Cardinal Carter Catholic Secondary School on Ellison Street, just steps from the original port-a-pack unit of classrooms attached to Queen of Peace in which served the students from 1988 to 1992. Building opened In the fall of 1993, Cardinal Carter opened the doors of its permanent facility and has grown to 900 students in just 18 years.

It is the second most important city of Cundinamarca according to its production. It is home to a number of recreational and vacational spots, mainly visited by people from Bogotá, as it is located at two hours drive from the city but enjoys a tropical climate (compared to the cold and rainy climate of Bogotá).  History  In Pre Colombian times the municipality of Girardot was inhabited by a tribe of Indians called the “Panches” whose origins are unknown. The municipality began with the hamlet of “La Chivatera” (the goat farm) because it was very common in the area to raise goats. The hamlet was located in the jurisdiction of the municipality of Tocaima, of which documents exist dated 1840 calling it “paso de Flandes” (step of Flanders). Through the aforementioned hamlet runs the Magdalena river moving southwest towards the center of the country. Due to its strategic position the area experienced steady growth, and thanks to the donation of land by Ramón Bueno and José Triana, the municipality was officially founded with the name of Girardot, in honor of General Atanasio Girardot. This was documented in the ordinance 20 on October 9, 1852 that says “… create a parish district with the name of Girardot…”. The first mayor of the district was named Claudio Clavijo. The parish was created in 1866 (reviewed by the Cudinamarca Gazette No 407 of July 7, 1891), and was the first parish of priest José Marcelino Pardo. The city began to develop in a grid pattern centered on San Miguel square, where a cathedral of the same name is located; whose architecture resembles that of the region. The first hotel in the city was built in 1884 to accommodate the constant flow of travelers and merchants and was named the Cisneros Hotel. Two years after the hotel was finished the population of the port was recorded as 2,163. As a result of the Thousand Days' War a large number of liberal refugees from the south and east of Tolima settled on land in the area. Geography The municipality lies on a plain, framed by the foothills of the Cordillera Oriental, without notable topographic features, with some areas of difficult access in the mountainous area on the border with Nariño called Alonso Vera cordillera. =Hydrography= Girardot has drainage basins and watersheds. The upper basin of the Magdalena River becomes the water resources of greater magnitude in a vast area of the country and the Bogotá River downstream. The basins located in the municipality are called El Cobre, Chicalá, Miraflores, El Gallo and ditches that collect rainwater from the top of the city, have shallow valleys and extension, unlike the micro basins Coyal, Zanja Honda, Quebrada Portachuelo and Yegüera that are deep and greater extent. =Climate= The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for Giradot's climate is \\"Aw\\" (Tropical Wet and Dry Climate), with generally hot conditions throughout the course of the year.Climate Summary for Girardot, Colombia Average temperature is 28 °C, with maximum of 38 °C and minimum of 23 °C. It has a bimodal pluviometric regimen with an average precipitation of 1167 mm per year. The dry periods are on the months of January and February; June, July and August; and September and December. Rainy months are in the months of March, April and May, and October and November. The warmest month, on average, is August with an average temperature of 30 °C (86.0 °F).

Twm o’r Nant was the pen name of the Welsh language dramatist and poet Thomas Edwards (January 1739 - 3 April 1810), also known as Tom of the Dingle. He was famous for his anterliwtau (interludes or short plays), which he performed mainly around his native Denbighshire. Earlier life Edwards was born in Llannefydd, Denbighshire (now in Conwy County Borough). When a child his parents moved to Y Nant Isaf (), near Nantglyn, from which he took his pen name. Edwards had little formal education: he attended one of Griffith Jones's circulating schools, where he learned to read, and attended a school in Denbigh for two weeks to learn English. However, he was eager to learn to write – he cadged writing paper and wrote with ink that he made from elderberries. In 1749 Edwards joined a local company of touring actors who typically performed on an improvised stage such as a cart. He wrote seven interludes before he was twenty years old, all of which have been lost. In 1763 Edwards married Elizabeth Hughes, the wedding having been conducted by the poet-priest Evan Evans (Ieuan Fardd). The couple settled in Denbigh, where Edwards worked hauling timber, performing in his interludes throughout North Wales and selling printed copies of them. After financial problems caused by the bankruptcy of his uncle, for whom he had stood surety, Edwards moved to South Wales, where he again worked in timber haulage and for a time kept an inn in Llandeilo. He returned to North Wales in 1786 to resume his performances of interludes, and became a stonemason. In 1808 he was working for William Madocks on the construction of the Porthmadog embankment. Social comments The interludes Edwards wrote comment on the social evils of his day. He frequently notes unpopular taxes, greedy landowners, swindling lawyers and immoral clergymen. The interludes form a link between the medieval and modern traditions of Welsh drama. He also wrote and published ballads, of which about 200 remain, some as fragments. His short autobiography appeared in the periodical Y Greal in 1805. Edwards took part in the annual eisteddfodau of the Gwyneddigion Society, the precursors of the National Eisteddfod. His failure to win the main prize at the Corwen Eisteddfod in 1789 may be due to a dispute over an impromptu composition competition with Walter Davies (Gwallter Mechain), in which Edwards was supported by David Samwell (Captain Cook's surgeon). Samwell named Edwards The Cambrian Shakespeare and gave him a silver pen as a consolation prize for having been unfairly beaten. The silver pen remains in the collection of National Museum Wales. Edwards died on 3 April 1810. He was buried at the original parish church of Denbigh, St Marcella's, where there is a memorial to him. Legacy Edwards's interludes were published after his death: a collection of six interludes appeared with Isaac Foulkes in 1874. George Borrow devotes two chapters to Edwards in his 1862 travel book Wild Wales: Its People, Language and Scenery. He includes a translation of part of Edwards' interlude Riches and Poverty. In 1974 the Welsh playwright Dedwydd Jones published Bard: a play on the life and times of Twm O'r Nant, which was commissioned as the opening play of the Sherman Theatre, Cardiff.

Around 1490 the Battle of Chocontá took place where zaque Michuá was supported by the cacique of Guatavita and lost with their outnumbered army of 60,000 guecha warriors against the zipa Saguamanchica. Both Muisca rulers died in this battle. History of the Muisca - Banco de la República - accessed 05-05-2016 Modern Guatavita was founded on March 18th, 1593 by Miguel de Ibarra. Guatavita was rebuilt on higher ground in the mid 1960s due to the construction of the Tominé Reservoir, which intentionally flooded the area of the town.  Etymology  In the Chibcha language of the Muisca, Guachetá means \\"end of the farming fields\\" or \\"point of the mountain range\\".  Economy  Main economical activities in Guatavita are agriculture, mining and tourism. In terms of agriculture most common are potatoes, maize, barley and peas. Tourism is mainly in the weekends when craft markets open in town.  Guatavita Lake  The sacred and ceremonial Lake Guatavita, of the pre- Columbian Muisca is located nearby, within the Sesquilé municipality of Almeidas Province.

It begins at the Nebraska border northeast of Niobrara, Nebraska, as a continuation of Nebraska Highway 14. It runs to the North Dakota border north of Hecla, where it continues as North Dakota Highway 1. It is in length. Route description History South Dakota 37 was in place by 1926, and largely has used the same alignment since. The only significant exception was in northeast South Dakota, where SD 37 originally went westward from Groton to Bath, then north via Columbia to Houghton, where it continued to Hecla. This segment was rerouted to the current alignment by 1929. On the south end, the road ended at the Missouri River at Running Water. A seasonal ferry was in place to carry traffic across the river. A direct connection via bridge did not open until 1998 when the Chief Standing Bear Memorial Bridge was completed. In the early and mid-1930s, the segment between Huron and Tripp was co-numbered as U.S. Route 281. This concurrency was dropped by 1936, when US 281 was realigned further west. The segment between Huron and Mitchell was upgraded to a 4-lane expressway, and was largely completed by 2004. A minor rerouting around the west end of Mitchell occurred, resulting in a concurrency with Interstate 90. Legal definition The route of SD 37 is defined in South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-158.

She took up swimming to aid her recovery.\\"At the age of five she had polio. … Her parents took her daily to a swimming pool where they hoped the water would help hold her arms up as she tried to use them again. When she could lift her arm out of the water with her own power, she cried for joy. Then her goal was to swim the width of the pool, then the length, then several lengths. She kept on trying, swimming, enduring, day after day after day, until she won the gold medal for the butterfly stroke—one of the most difficult of all swimming strokes.\\" (Marvin J.

These bound compounds are then transferred to the thiol group of the enzyme followed by conversion of its configuration, the D-isomer being the more favorable configuration of the two, with a 7 to 3 ratio between the two isomers. The racemisation reaction of phenylalanine is coupled with the highly favorable hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PP), thermodynamically allowing it to proceed.

Originally intended for publication by Ballantine Books as a volume of the celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, it actually saw print only after the series was discontinued. It was first published in paperback by Ballantine Books in November 1974. It has been reprinted a number of times since, and gathered together with Walton's other Mabinogion novels by Overlook Press as the omnibus The Mabinogion Tetralogy in 2002. The novel has also been published in translation in several European languages. The other three novels in the series are The Island of the Mighty (1936), The Children of Llyr (1971), and The Song of Rhiannon (1972). The novel is a retelling of the story of the First Branch of the Mabinogion, Pwyll Pendefig Dyfed (Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed), and hence is chronologically the first of Walton's Mabinogion novels, though published last. Plot summary Pwyll, the prince of Dyved, offends Arawn, ruler of Annwn (the underworld), by baiting his hunting hounds on a stag that Arawn's dogs had brought down. In recompense he agrees to exchanges places with Arawn for a year. Arawn is pledged to fight his enemy Havgan, whom Walton represents as a member of a conquering eastern pantheon, by whom he is destined to be defeated unless the mortal takes his place. Pwyll must overcome a number of foes to reach the Land of the Dead, and additional perils on his way to face Havgan, the worst threat of all, a deity whose evil is masked by an attractive beauty. Nonetheless, Pwyll manages to overcome his foe. For the remainder of the year he enjoys the luxury and prerogatives of the lord of Annwn in Arawn's guise, until the time comes to trade places again. He does not, however, sleep with Arawn's wife, thus earning the lord of Annwn's gratitude. On his return to the mortal realm Pwyll encounters Rhiannon of the Birds, a beautiful maiden whose ambling horse cannot be overtaken. To win her hand he must overcome Gwawl, a rival suitor to whom she is betrothed. He ultimately succeeds by trapping Gwawl in a magic bag that can never be filled and having him beaten to death in the bag. Pwyll and Rhiannon have a son, but the baby disappears the night after his birth, and the mother, suspected of murdering him, is sentenced to a humiliating punishment. In fact the child was taken by a monster who preys on newborns. The beast has also been raiding the stables of Teyrnon; returning to carry off the latest foal, it is surprised by the now watchful owner, who manages to rescue both foal and child. Teyrnon and his wife name the boy Gwri Golden Hair and raise him as their own. As Gwri grows up he increasingly resembles his real father; realizing who he is, Teyrnon returns him to his true parents. Rhiannon is released from her ordeal, and the boy is renamed Pryderi (\\"worry\\").

History  Before the Spanish conquest of the Muisca, the area was inhabited by the Panche who were notable warriors and defeated by an alliance of the Spanish conquistadors and the zipa Sagipa in the Battle of Tocarema on August 20, 1538. This town is famed for the Botanical Expedition on the New Kingdom of Granada which commenced from there in 1783 led by the biologist José Celestino Mutis. The expedition researched local fauna and flora. It was also an important trade centre during the 19th and part of the 20th century. Originally La Mesa was located a short distance from its present location and was known as Guayabal. But because of lack of water and too much mud, it was moved in 1777 by order of Pedro Messia de la Zerda, Manuel Guirior and Manuel Antonio Flórez, Spanish Viceroys. The town centre was located the Main Plaza (Downtown), next to the Carbonera river, today an underground river. The original location had 98 houses and nowadays is now known by the name of Dos Caminos, (Two Roads in Spanish). The population of La Mesa was part of the Independence from Spain movement.

The battle took place in and around the French city of Cambrai, between 8 and 10 October 1918. The battle incorporated many of the newer tactics of 1918, in particular tanks. The attack was an overwhelming success with light casualties in an extremely short amount of time. Battle There were three German lines, spanning some ; held by the 20th Landwehr and the 54th Reserve divisions, supported by no more than 150 guns.Keegan (UK ed), p 396 The weak defence was due to the Allied general offensive across the Western Front, and specifically in this sector, the rapid approach of the Canadian Corps, who had overwhelmed much stronger defences in the previous days.Christie, p 125 The German defenders were unprepared for the bombardment by 324 tanks, closely supported by infantry and aircraft.Keegan (UK ed), p 397 On 8 October, the 2nd Canadian Division entered Cambrai and encountered sporadic and light resistance.

The British soldier Arthur Bullock recounts entering Cambrai after it had been taken and the Front had moved to a ridge beyond. He describes the continued repulsion of the German forces, with \\"masses of troops being deployed and withdrawn to a strict timetable\\", and recorded that \\"what made the heart beat faster was the sound of music – the battalions were marching in with bands playing\\". He recalled that over half a million men could be seen from one position: \\"It was a spectacle on a grand scale, of irresistible military might operated on a clockwork basis with an assurance and buoyancy of spirit which baffles description\\".

Life According to Eyton, he succeeded to the estates of his uncles Walter and Drogo. These two brothers figure in Domesday as the possessors of lands in Herefordshire, Berkshire, and other counties. His father Richard seems to have died between 1115 and 1138, in which latter year we find 'Walter de Cliffort' signing a Gloucester charter. He reappears under the same name in 1155. He probably obtained the barony of Clifford, from his wife Margaret, asserted to be the daughter of Raoul IV de Conches and thus the Granddaughter of Raoul II of Tosny, feudal lord of Flamstead, who is shown, in 1086, as 'tenant-in- chief' of this fee, the multiple lords being listed as Drogo (son of Poyntz); Gilbert (son of Turold); Herbert; and Roger. (A second listing for Clifford in Doomsday shows Roger de Lacy, as lord and tenant-in-chief, of a small portion of this barony, being taxed on 4 carucates) According to another theory, his mother Maud, wife of Richard FitzPonce, was the original holder of it. Towards the middle of Henry II's reign, he was possessed of the manors of Corfham, Culmington, in Shropshire. He was a benefactor to several monasteries, e.g. Haughmond Abbey, Dore, and Godstow. Clifford's name occurs in the Welsh annals as lord of the castle of Llandovery. He ravaged the lands of Rhys ap Gruffydd, who, finding his complaints to Henry II disregarded, surprised his castle (1157-9). In 1163, he is said to have slain Einion ab Anarawd, son of Anarawd ap Gruffydd. In 1164, he is said to have slain Cadwgan, son of Maredudd. He was still living in 1187, and according to Eyton died in 1190. Family He was the son of Richard FitzPons and Matilda, who was the sister of Miles de Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford, and daughter of Walter de Gloucester . He married Margaret de Toeni, daughter of Ralph de Toeni, having children by her: *Walter de Clifford (c. 1160 – 17 January 1221) *Gilbert *Richard *Amicia, married Osbern fitz Hugh of Richards Castle *Lucia, married Hugh de Say of Clun Castle *Rosamund Clifford, known as \\"the fair Rosamund\\", the mistress of King Henry II. The main part of the Clifford estates passed to Matilda, a great-granddaughter, wife of Sir William Longespée (grandson of William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury), whose daughter, Margery Longespée, brought them to her husband, Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln. Walter de Clifford's grandson Roger (died 1231) was father of Roger (died 1285?).

History The Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway (M&GN;) was formed in 1893. The M&GN; possessed insufficient locomotives to work all of its services, and so a number of locomotives were loaned by the railway's two co-owners, the Great Northern Railway and the Midland Railway (MR). To avoid the necessity for such loans, the MR's Locomotive Superintendent, Samuel Waite Johnson, designed a class of 4-4-0 tender locomotives specifically for use on the M&GN.; These had much in common with the MR's 1808 class, which had first appeared in 1888. 26 locomotives of the new design were built by Sharp, Stewart & Co. in 1894, with a further seven following in 1896; a final seven were built by Beyer, Peacock & Co. in 1899 bringing the total to 40. Their numbers on the M&GN; were 1–7, 11–14, 17, 18, 36–39, 42–57, 74–80, and they formed M&GN; Class C. Ten more were built to the same design by Beyer, Peacock in 1900, but these were for the MR, where they formed the 2581 class. As built, the engines had round-topped fireboxes, and the boiler barrel had a maximum diameter of . When boilers became due for replacement, the replacement boilers were of various types, some of which had Belpaire fireboxes, and some were larger, being diameter. When they passed to the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) on 1 October 1936, it was decided to add a zero prefix to their M&GN; numbers, to avoid duplication with existing LNER engines, so M&GN; no. 1 became LNER no. 01; but 14 locomotives were withdrawn before the prefix could be applied. The remaining 26 had their numbers altered between October 1936 and December 1937. On the LNER they initially retained the M&GN; class C, but this was soon subdivided into C/1, C/2 and C/3 according to boiler design. They were reclassified as D52, D53 and D54 in July 1942: * C/1, D52 Round-top firebox * C/2, D53 Small Belpaire firebox * C/3, D54 Large Belpaire firebox When the LNER post-war numbering scheme was prepared, it was based on the locomotive stock on 4 July 1943, by which time 19 more had been withdrawn, leaving seven: of these, class D52 nos. 038 & 076 were allotted 2050–1, class D53 nos. 050, 06 & 077 were to become 2052–4, and D54 nos. 055–6 were allotted 2055–6. However, by the time that the scheme was issued in December that year, a further four had been withdrawn, leaving just the three D53 in the final list; and before the renumbering actually began in January 1946, all three of those had also been withdrawn, the last in January 1945. Preservation None of the locomotives were preserved, however, a boiler does survive after being rediscovered in a Maldon timber works factory and there are talks of a static locomotive being built with the boiler.Steam Railway Magazine 359 Notes References  External links * The S.W.Johnson D52, D53, & D54 (M&GN; Class C) 4-4-0 Class Locomotives LNER Encyclopedia D52 Category:4-4-0 locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1894 C Category:Sharp Stewart locomotives Category:Beyer, Peacock locomotives Category:Scrapped locomotives Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain ","title":"M&amp;GN Class C"},{"id":"10732893","title":"1965 Polish legislative election"},{"id":"10732896","text":"La Peña is a municipality and town of Colombia in the department of Cundinamarca.

It is located in the Almeidas Province in the Tenza Valley. Manta borders to the north Tibiritá, to the west Machetá, to the south Gachetá and to the east Guateque and Guayatá of the department of Boyacá. Official website Manta  Etymology  Manta in the Chibcha language of the Muisca means \\"to your tillage\\" or \\"your farmfields\\".Espejo Olaya, 1999, p.1121 This name comes from the ancient indigenous people who inhabited the territory of the Muisca Confederation. Another Muisca name that remains is the name of the vereda Fuchatoque, located on the eastern side of the city center, headquarters of the former cacique with the same name.  History  = Pre- Columbian and colonial period = The first inhabitants, indigenous Muisca, settled in pre-Columbian times, around the plateau of the current town centre, which was once a small lake. According to the founding myth in the center of the lake was an island, which was sighted in the image of San Joaquín, a name that means the actual building of the Catholic church. Before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores, Manta was part of the domains and boundaries of the Muisca Confederation, but after the conquest, the indigenous inhabitants were displaced to the neighboring municipality of Tibiritá. The Spanish and mestizos were those who stayed to form the town of Manta. Modern Manta was founded on July 24, 1773 by José Joaquín Pompeya. Another of the founders was named Juan José Bernal Ramírez. To set the limits and jurisdiction of the municipality, the territory was formed from the area called \\"Manta Grande\\" adding a piece of land that included the old municipality of Guateque. = Republican period = The constitution of the United States of Colombia created conflicts between federalist and centralist groups, and between conservatives and liberals in the late nineteenth century. One of the key events was a conspiracy by the president of the Federal State of Cundinamarca, General Daniel Aldana (born in Manta), who commanded troops in support of revolutionary and radical integralist federalism in Bogota, attempted a failed coup State against the President of the Union Rafael Nuñez. After that, Daniel Aldana was removed from office and Cundinamarca became a Federal District by Decree 769 of November 7, 1885, and Gen. Jaime Córdoba would be named governor.Velandia, R. 1979. Enciclopedia histórica de Cundinamarca. Bogotá D.C.: BAC. In the early twentieth century, Manta was not exempt from the political violence that hit the country, and for several years was the scene of the war between the traditional parties (liberal and conservative parties). Some roads still show some trenches that over time have been filled with little vegetation. Manta is also historically known as one of the possible places of birth of Jorge Eliécer Gaitán.  Geography  The territory that makes up the town of Manta is located in the eastern side of the eastern range of the Colombian Andes. It is a steep mountainous terrain irregularities with a single plateau where is located the urban area. These irregularities cause abrupt elevation varies from to of altitude. The maximum altitude is 3400 m that corresponds to the hill of La Laguna also named hill of La Petaca. Manta is located in a depression formed by the river basin of the Aguacia River that divides the territory into two parts. The territory is bounded by a mountain course that begins and ends in the north where the Machetá River and the Aguacia River form the Sunuba River, tributary of the water reservoir of La Esmeralda (\\"The Emerald\\"), in Chivor. At the top of the mountain, is the Laguna del Cerro (\\"Lake of the Hill\\"), which has been established as a nature reserve area of the municipality. There are several creeks and streams along the mountain river flowing into the 'Aguacia river'. Some of these streams as it descends through the mountains and waterfalls form the creek of El Golpe (\\"The Strike\\").  Climate  Manta is located in the eastern side of the Andes mountains, the climate of Manta has the distinction of being influenced more by the winds from the Llanos Orientales of Colombia. The climate is very pleasant most of the year, presenting an average temperature between 18 and 23 °C (73.4 °F). It is a dry equatorial climate for the forest ecosystem of high mountain (high Andean forest or cloud forest). Despite being affected by the phenomenon of El Niño and in most of Colombia, in the storms and heavy rain periods of La Niña the weather of Manta remains drier compared to the region of the Bogotá savanna. The rainy season runs from mid-April to mid-November. The driest months are December and January. Extreme temperatures recorded in the city center have been 11 °C (51.8 °F) the coldest and 28 °C (82.4 °F) the warmest.  Demographics  The town's inhabitants are mostly descendants of early Spanish colonists and the Muisca. The population has decreased since the 1960s, due to migration to big cities like Bogota. However, because of its location near the Sabana de Bogota, Manta has become a place of rest and holiday, mainly of people who keep a link with the municipality. This makes the population varies significantly throughout the year, especially during vacation seasons, weekends and bank holidays. Manta is regularly inhabited by a population of about 4,500 inhabitants, however, in times of greatest influx of nonresident population this figure can vary between 10,000 and 16,000 inhabitants without counting the number of tourists.  Tourism  In recent years, Manta has become a place of rest from the hectic life of the big cities. There are some natural tourist destinations like the Quebrada El Golpe, the Laguna de la Petaca, and the Cerro de la Petaca. The lake El Golpe is located at above sea level and has become a nature reserve next to adjacent native forest and Cerro de la Petaca. This reserve is under the administration of the municipality, and is visited on annual trips scheduled in the first week of January. The municipality also has developed infrastructure for sports and recreational activities such as a stadium, the sports center and the municipal swimming pool.

It interacts with multiple military events in the region for independence and stability. Independence from Carthage The Punic Wars were a series of wars fought between Rome and the city-state of Carthage. During these wars the Algerians took the opportunity to become independent of Carthage, and Algerian kingdoms were established. Roman Africa Al-Andalus Horses, but few chariots which were largely obsolete, gave scouts, raiders, and rare armored riders an advantage in speed, momentum behind each forward blow during a charge, and height to reach over the shields of opposing infantry. One helpful aspect of chariots was that after a very successful raid that found much plunder but not much resistance or pursuit, a raiding party could fill the basket of the chariot and haul plunder with it. Alternatively, a good archer could stockpile bundles of pre-positioned quivers full of arrows under piles of sand, circle a small enemy formation, taunt them into pursuit if they were ill-disciplined, then shoot arrows while retreating. Then, they could roll on back to the buried bundles of arrows, then keep shooting. Roman auxiliaries performed this kind of attack while hiding the fact that a larger force of infantry encamped a few miles away. For all the enemy knew, it was just another raid. A chariot provided a stable platform so that with a separate driver, an archer did not have to be as specially trained as nomadic horse archers often were, and had room for more spare quivers to hang off the rim of the basket. Light cavalry could chase down a retreating chariot while covered with a shield, often made from wicker, leather or rawhide. Romans employed North African horsemen for this, and used them during fighting with raiding tribes, the Seleucid wars, and the Roman-Parthian Wars. Successor states did the same against raids, and the more ambitious chased raiding parties all the way back to their hideouts. Some did not bother for fear of ambush. Eventually, one man, one horse became the rule due to the maneuverability of a less encumbered horse and the added expense of building and maintaining a chariot. Some chariot designs enabled a team to stop, unhook the horses, leave the chariot behind in a chosen spot and mount the horses to fight as cavalry. If they had infantry along, the infantrymen could lock the wheels of multiple chariots thus freed as barricades, though this risked damage to the chariot itself. A solid axeblow to the wheelspokes can render a chariot useless if they are wooden. A spearman or an axeman could stand in the basket for added height to strike at oncoming enemies more effectively, or a foot archer or slinger if they have shield-bearers in front. Armies invading the area later on often came from regions where chariotry had already been abandoned. Watchtowers were common. The hot climate and the centuries of upheaval during and after the collapse of western Roman central authority meant the shortest- lived successor states did not have an opportunity to develop heavy cavalry along the lines of Byzantine cataphracts. Camels, mules and other pack animals were used for logistics. Heat made water sources of great importance. Tribal warfare continued on the Algerian Desert. Some tribes voluntarily accepted Islam when they met to trade. Larger, more organized expeditions southward encountered indigenous west African cultures, formed new trade links, drew maps which circulated farther north, and wrote down observations. They gradually spread cattle and the horse, although many tribes already had one or both. Dynasty fought dynasty. Rebels rose up. Some men went north to the coast or to islands in the Mediterranean and took up piracy, or to help hold the frontier in Iberia. A few ships occasionally went east to fight in wars against the Byzantine Empire. They learned to avoid ships carrying Greek fire. Trade with states to the east brought Damascus steel weapons. Ottoman Algeria By the time of Ottoman Dynasty rule, black powder weapons had already become a common feature of warfare around the Mediterranean. Swords, such as the Nimcha, were still in use. Helmet wearing varied considerably, and many men who could afford a good helmet still did not wear one, a turban providing sufficient protection against one or two swordblows that might get past their guard, as well as shade from the sun, while being cooler especially if watered down and with more free airflow than steel permits. Horses remained valuable. A horseman could ride to enemy lines, throw his javelins, if any, fire a flintlock or a matchlock, hack away with a sword, then ride off before getting bogged down or exhausted. Muskets also made helmets more or less pointless. A stout metal shield could help cover a man and his neighbor in line from musketfire at extreme range, but was so heavy that most men who could afford both chose a musket for its range and didn't bother with the bulk and weight of a shield. Some armies would give slaves metal shields to cover the fighting men from enemy fire, but no weapons for fear of mutiny, and sent them back from the line to guard the commander if hand-to-hand combat broke out. In this way, some slaves noted for bravery were set free. Contrary to European stereotype, not all were Black Guards. Some came from Sub-Saharan Africa, while others came from Europe. A few are noted to have accepted Islam, much like Jan Janzsoon, though not often so well-known. Naval engagements during this period saw new ships like the caravel, the galeass, the galleon, the frigate, and the ship of the line. With sailpower more commonly driving ships on the open ocean, navigation beyond shore became more important. Cannon became more powerful. Island bases and coastal forts retained strategic significance and fighting and military planning reflected this reality. Port cities were often guarded by a fort at each end, with wall-shielded docks ready for defending forces' fighters to board their ships and sally (military) forth, or to provide cover if enemy fire became too heavily concentrated. European powers built star forts to better withstand cannonfire. Observers in North Africa mirrored this trend. Pirates continued to operate in small oar- driven boats without fixed masts to give them away while coming up on shore or alongside larger vessels. Larger pirate vessels were also in use. Boarding parties swung on ropes to reach the target deck or rigging, or extended hook- ended planks to walk across, a boarding tactic in use since at least the time of the First Punic War. Ribbed planks or rope ladders offered a way up the sides of much steeper ships. Boarders could expect incoming swivel gun fire, and grapeshot loaded in heavier guns if the boarded vessel had time to raise the alarm. Barbary Wars The First and Second Barbary Wars were a series of conflicts between the United States and the Barbary States in North Africa. At issue was the pirates' demand of tribute from American vessels in the Mediterranean. The United States paid taxes and rights fees to access the Mediterranean sea until the end of the Second Barbary War. French Conquest Abd-el-Kader France seized Algiers in 1830, using as justification an alleged insult to the French consul by the reigning Dey of Algiers. The conquest of Algeria by the French faced long and bitter opposition, led from 1832 to 1847 by the Algerian resistance leader Abd-el-Kader. The French Army used scorched- earth tactics and there were heavy losses amongst the indigenous Kabyle and Arab peoples (estimated to have numbered about 2 million in 1830). It was not until 1857 that the country was physically occupied and complete pacification was not achieved until 1881. The conquest was not technically completed until the early 1900s when the last Tuareg were conquered and the Sahara came under full French control. French Army of Africa The French Foreign Legion was established in 1831 by King Louis Philippe. The Legion was based in Algeria for 130 years, an experience which came to shape its character. The French Army recruited extensively from the Berber and Arab peoples of Algeria throughout the period of French rule (1830–1962). Most were employed as infantry (Tirailleurs) and cavalry (Spahis). Algerian troops saw extensive service in the Crimean War, Mexico, the Franco-Prussian War, various colonial campaigns in Africa, Tonkin and Syria, both World Wars, and the First Indochina War. In addition to indigenous troops, the French Army raised regiments of Zouaves and Chasseurs d' Afrique for service in Algeria. Originally comprising French volunteers, these units were after 1871 mostly drawn from French settlers in Algeria (\\"pied-noirs\\") undertaking their military service. Following the end of the Algerian War (1962) most of France's North African units were disbanded. A reduced Foreign Legion and one regiment each of Spahis, Tirailleurs and Chasseurs d'Afrique remain in the modern French Army, World War II During World War II, Algeria, along with North Africa, were under the control of Nazi Germany and Vichy France. On November 8, 1942 the Allies launched the first major offensive of the war codenamed Operation Torch. Allied Forces led by Dwight D. Eisenhower landed on the northern beaches and advanced south against an army of 60,000 Vichy troops. The Allies retook Morocco along with Algeria, establishing the liberation of northern Africa. During the War, large numbers of both Muslim and European Algerians served with the French Army. Algerian troops particularly distinguished themselves as part of the French Expeditionary Corps under General Juin, during the Italian campaign of 1943 and the Allied invasion of southern France in 1944.Alistair Horne, page 42 \\"A Savage War of Peace\\", War of Independence The Algerian War of Independence was a series of uprisings and guerilla warfare by Algerian Nationalists against the French administration and army, the pied-noir community of European descent, and pro-French Muslim militias (Harkis). During the war the French Fourth Republic collapsed and Charles de Gaulle established a new Republic. Algeria gained independence in 1962 with Ahmed Ben Bella as the first President. The conflict has had a lasting impact on France and Algeria because of the atrocities committed on both sides. The nationalist Armee de Liberation Nationale (ALN) (see below) came to number about 150,000 lightly armed troops by 1962, serving both in Algeria and beyond its borders. The bulk of actual fighting was carried out by varying numbers of \\"internal\\" irregular fighters who comprised six regional commands.John Keegan, page 13 \\"World Armies\\" While beaten in most direct clashes, notably after 1957, the poorly equipped and outnumbered internal forces were able to maintain an effective opposition to a French Army of nearly half a million troops, throughout an extended struggle that cost up to a million Algerian lives. New Algerian Army The Armee de Liberation Nationale (ALN was created shortly after the Algerian rising began in 1954. It comprised both internal and external wings (the latter based in Tunisia and Morocco during the war). It was the well armed and trained external wing who made up the bulk of the new Armee Nationale Populaire (ANP) created in 1962. Only some 10,000 of the 50,000-60,000 who had fought in the internal forces were taken into the ANP while the remainder were demobilised.John Keegan, page 13 \\"World Armies\\", The regular element of the Algerian armed forces remained at a level of 60,000-70,000 after independence until 1969 when conscription was introduced. Most conscripts however were employed on non-military duties after doing their basic training. Sand War The Sand War occurred along the Algerian-Moroccan border in October 1963, and was a Moroccan attempt to claim the Tindouf and the Bechar. Border skirmishes escalated into a full-blown confrontation, with intense fighting around the oasis towns. The Organisation of African Unity eventually managed to arrange a formal cease-fire and a peace agreement was then made. Tensions between the two countries have continued, arising primarily from both political differences and outstanding border issues in the southern Sahara. There have however been no further actual clashes. 1967 and Yom Kippur Wars Algeria sent a battalion of infantry and a squadron of MiG-21s to Egypt during the 1967 Six-Day War with Israel. While the troops did not see active service, reportedly six MiGs were lost.John Keegan, page 15 World Armies, The 1973 Yom Kippur War was the fourth major conflict between Israel and the neighboring Arab States. Like many other Arab States, Algeria contributed to the fighting in the Yom Kippur War. The Algerian government sent squadrons of fighters and bombers along with an armored brigade. Algerian Civil War The Algerian Civil War was a bloody conflict between the Algerian government and various radical Islamic militias. The conflict lasted from 1991 to 2002 when the Islamic Salvation Army surrendered to the government but minor skirmishes still continue in parts of the country. During the conflict a series of massacres took place. The Armed Islamic Group has claimed responsibility for many of them. For others no group has claimed responsibility. In addition to generating a widespread sense of fear, these massacres and the ensuing flight of population have resulted in serious depopulation in the worst-affected areas.

Mosquera is close to the capital Bogotá and is part of its metropolitan area. The urban centre of Mosquera is situated at an altitude of on the Bogotá savanna. The municipality borders the localities Bosa and Fontibón of Bogotá in the east, Soacha in the south, Madrid and Funza in the north and Bojacá in the west. Official website Mosquera  Etymology  Mosquera is named after its founder, former president of Colombia Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera, who in 1861 separated Mosquera from Funza.  History  Mosquera is close to Lake Herrera, a remnant lake of the large Pleistocene Lake Humboldt that existed on the Bogotá savanna until approximately 30,000 years BP. The archaeological findings around Lake Herrera date to the preceramic period, predating the Herrera Period, named after the lake. The Muisca established their civilisation typically as of 800 AD. They were an advanced culture and performed agriculture on the high plains of the savanna. In the Muisca times maize, potatoes, arracacha, quinoa, sweet potatoes, yuca, peppers, tomatoes, beans and pumpkins were cultivated in Mosquera. The Muisca were predominantly farmers and traders and their economy was based on the extraction of salt from the northern parts of the Bogotá savanna. Fruits and other agricultural products growing in different climates were traded on the frequent markets of the Muisca. In Mosquera pineapples, avocadoes, guanabanas, ice-cream beans, pitahayas and guayabas were the fruits traded with warmer climates. Tobacco also came from more tropical regions while cotton was traded with the colder climate Lache. Funza, of which Mosquera formed the southern part until 1861, was founded by conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada who arrived in the region on April 20, 1537. Presently, Mosquera is a satellite town of the capital Bogotá and has grown significantly in recent years.

Created by Richard and Esther Shapiro, the role of Fallon was originated by Pamela Sue Martin in the show's first episode in 1981, and Martin left at the end of the fourth season in 1984. Fallon was recast with Emma Samms in 1985, and the character was spun off onto a companion series called The Colbys. After the cancellation of the second series, Fallon (portrayed by Samms) returned to Dynasty in 1987, and remained on the series until its finale in 1989. Samms later reprised the role for the 1991 miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion. Elizabeth Gillies plays Fallon in The CW's 2017 reboot series Dynasty. Fallon is the daughter of oil baron Blake Carrington and his first wife, Alexis, portrayed by John Forsythe and Joan Collins in the original series. Initially a self-indulgent troublemaker constantly at odds with her father's second wife, Krystle (Linda Evans), Fallon navigates a series of romantic entanglements that includes marriages to Jeff Colby (John James) and his half-brother and cousin, Miles Colby (Maxwell Caulfield). Original series =Characterization= Fallon is introduced in 1981 as a fiery heiress as intelligent and business savvy as her millionaire father Blake Carrington, but not taken seriously by him because she is a woman. With a place at the family company Denver-Carrington unavailable to her, Fallon instead indulges herself with multiple lovers and torturing her new stepmother Krystle (Linda Evans). David Hofstede described Martin's Fallon as \\"a spoiled bitch with an acid tongue whose idea of fun was to sleep with her father's chauffeur\\". Martin told People in 1982, \\"Fallon has lovers, but they don't mean anything to her\\". Actor John James said of the relationship between Fallon and his character, her \\"loving-but-unloved\\" husband Jeff Colby, \\"There's an attraction there in two people who know they're wrong for each other\\". Alex Mar wrote for Slate: Emma Samms said at the time of her hiring, \\"I'm always going for the sympathetic aspect of a character.\\" She also noted, \\"I'm not going to sit and watch hours of Pamela Sue so I can reproduce the kind of performance she gave. I want to be accepted as me.\\" According to Samms, before Dynasty final season, producer David Paulsen asked her what she would like to do with Fallon. She explained in 1989, \\"I said, 'I'd like to do more humorous stuff and be a bit more realistic character, not always the victim.' And that\`s what he did. This year I was allowed to be a more real character.\\" =Appearances= Emma Samms replaced Pamela Sue Martin as Fallon in 1985. Dynasty debuted in January 1981, with Pamela Sue Martin portraying Fallon. In 2006, she said of Forsythe, \\"He really was like a father to me. I asked John to walk me down the aisle when I got married in real life, but he said, 'I think maybe you should ask your real dad.' I was just so attached to him.\\" Martin left the series at the end of the fourth season in May 1984. In the storyline, a troubled Fallon leaves Jeff at the altar, and is later presumed dead in an offscreen plane crash. At the time, New York quoted Martin as calling television \\"limiting\\". USA Today reported in 2006 that Martin \\"left Dynasty and acting when she felt her 'glib' character ... had been reduced to 'a victim'.\\" In 2011, she said \\"I became extremely famous during that time, and it was a little discomforting\\". Executive producer Aaron Spelling wrote in his 1996 autobiography, \\"After three seasons, Pamela Sue Martin wanted to leave Dynasty to get married and we didn't stand in her way.\\" The role was later recast with British actress Emma Samms, and Fallon reappears with amnesia at the end of the fifth season in the April 1985 episode \\"Kidnapped\\". In his 2004 television history book What Were They Thinking?, David Hofstede recounted that Samms had been suggested to Spelling by his young daughter, Tori, who was a fan of Samms in her role of Holly Scorpio on the daytime soap opera General Hospital. Samms, who had appeared in two episodes of Spelling's drama series Hotel in 1984 and 1985, met with Dynasty co-creator Esther Shapiro for a non-specific role, which led to her casting as Fallon. Samms said, \\"The audience was so fond of the character that they were willing to accept a new actress playing the role.\\" She added that the cast was welcoming, explaining \\"It wasn't as if Pamela Sue had been fired. She left of her own volition, so there were no hard feelings.\\" Samms appeared in eight episodes of the sixth season of Dynasty, and the character was spun off onto a separate series called The Colbys. A main character on The Colbys, Fallon continued to guest star on Dynasty, with Samms appearing in one episode at the end of the sixth season and two episodes of the seventh season. After the cancellation of The Colbys, Fallon (played by Samms) returned to Dynasty for its eighth season in the September 1987 season premiere episode \\"The Siege\\". Screening old episodes while developing the ninth season, new executive producer Paulsen felt that Samms was beautiful, but came across as \\"stiff\\". He considered trying to bring back Martin, but wanted to first meet with Samms. He said in 2008: At the end of that 1988–1989 season, Paulsen told a shocked Samms his original plan. He said, \\"I'm so glad I didn't replace her ... Emma worked out superbly.\\" That season ended up as Dynasty last. Samms later reprised the role for the 1991 miniseries Dynasty: The Reunion. In the 1989 episode \\"Blasts from the Past\\", Cheyenne Fitch portrayed Fallon as a child. =Storylines= Season 1 As Dynasty begins, spoiled Carrington heiress Fallon is underestimated by—and considered little more than a trophy to—her father, oil baron Blake. Though she is as cunning and intelligent as he is, there are no women in the family business. Still, Fallon is devoted to Blake and is wary and disdainful of his new wife (and former secretary) Krystle. Fallon is also close to her younger brother Steven, who is struggling with his sexual orientation. A promiscuous Fallon resumes her past affair with her father's chauffeur Michael Culhane. She has a flirtatious relationship with Blake's friend and business rival, Cecil Colby, and later agrees to marry Cecil's nephew, Jeff, to secure Cecil's assistance when her father's company runs into financial trouble. A jealous Michael tells Blake about Fallon's arrangement, causing friction between father and daughter. When Jeff learns that his marriage is just part of a business deal, he embarrasses Fallon by drunkenly broadcasting the details to a room full of party guests. Fallon is sympathetic to Jeff, but still does not feel she can return his love. Trying to protect Steven from Blake's wrath, she tries to keep Steven's ex-boyfriend Ted Dinard from contacting him but is unable to keep them apart. When Blake comes upon the two men in an embrace, he pushes Ted away from Steven. Ted falls, hits his head, and dies. Blake is arrested and charged with murder. Fallon lies about her father's mental state on the witness stand, in an attempt to protect him. When a mysterious woman is called into the courtroom, Fallon recognizes the witness as her mother. Season 2 The surprise witness for the prosecution is Fallon's long-absent mother, Alexis. Fallon is furious as Alexis testifies against Blake, who is found guilty but does not have to serve jail time. Fallon is icy and, jealous of her daughter's love for Blake, a spiteful Alexis begins to spread the rumor that he is not Fallon's father. When Krystle announces she is pregnant, Fallon decides that she and Jeff should have a baby as well. Fallon begins an affair with Dr. Nick Toscanni, and Krystle is thrown from a horse in \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" and loses her baby. Fallon learns that she is pregnant in \\"The Mid-East Meeting\\", but decides to have divorce Jeff and have an abortion. Blake finds out and rushes to stop her, but when he arrives he learns that she could not go through with it. Hiding a longstanding grudge against Blake, Nick tries to seduce Krystle while he romances Fallon. His overtures toward Krystle do not go unnoticed by Fallon, who becomes petulant and jealous. She continues to rebuff Alexis despite their mutual dislike of Krystle. In \\"The Party\\", Fallon confronts her mother about the rumor that Blake is not her father. While driving together, Alexis reveals that she believes Cecil Colby is Fallon's father, and a horrified Fallon crashes the car. At the hospital, Fallon goes into premature labor and delivers a boy in \\"The Baby\\". In \\"The Gun\\", Blake demands a blood test which proves that he, not Cecil, is Fallon's father. Fallon and Jeff name their son Blake Carrington Colby, called \\"Little Blake\\", but in the 1982 season finale \\"The Cliff\\", Fallon discovers that the baby has been kidnapped. Season 3 Claudia Blaisdel, an unstable woman who lost her child, becomes the primary suspect in Little Blake's kidnapping. The baby's nanny, however, also has ties to the disgraced Nick. In a televised plea to return their grandson, Alexis and Blake reveal the shocking secret that their eldest child, Adam, had been kidnapped as an infant and was never returned. The kidnapper turns out to be Alfred Grimes, the father of the man whose affair with Alexis prompted Blake to exile her. Fallon asks for control of Blake's struggling hotel, La Mirada, which she remodels and renames La Mirage. Jeff is upset by Fallon's decision to work and accuses her of neglecting their child. Fallon flirts with Michael Torrance, a handsome stranger who is staying at the hotel, and they share a kiss. In \\"The Siblings\\", she is horrified to learn from Alexis that Michael is Adam, Fallon's long lost brother. Fallon hires Mark Jennings as her tennis instructor in \\"Mark\\", only to learn that he is Krystle's ex-husband, brought to Denver by Alexis to cause trouble for Blake. Fallon soon begins an affair with Mark, not knowing that he is also sleeping with her mother. Meanwhile, finally realizing that Krystle truly loves Blake, Fallon reaches out to her stepmother, and the two mend fences in \\"Samantha\\". Fallon hires Joseph's daughter, Kirby, to be her son's nanny. As Fallon's marriage to Jeff deteriorates, she is annoyed by Kirby's obvious designs on Jeff. His behavior becomes more erratic and violent, and he attacks Fallon after finding her in Mark's hotel room. Angry and upset, Fallon decides her marriage is finally over and flies to Haiti for a divorce. She continues her relationship with Mark, while Jeff marries Kirby on the rebound. Alexis tries to coerce Mark to end things with Fallon in \\"The Vote\\", but he refuses. In \\"The Dinner\\", however, Alexis arranges for Fallon to discover her in Mark's bed. Fallon learns that Jeff's odd behavior was caused by inhaling toxic chemicals in the paint used in his office, and comes to suspect Adam of deliberately causing it. Season 4 Fallon and Jeff travel to Billings, Montana to investigate Adam's past and wind up sleeping together. They learn that Adam once tried a case in which a worker was poisoned by toxic paint fumes. She reveals the truth to Blake, but Adam has framed Alexis for the crime. Fallon becomes romantically involved with European tycoon Peter De Vilbis, and they soon become engaged. Blake, Jeff, and even Steven's wife Claudia warn her off the smarmy Peter. When one of Blake's prize racehorses is \\"kidnapped\\" and held for ransom, Fallon learns that Peter set it up to extort money from Blake. Upset and confused by Peter's betrayal, a despondent Fallon is hit by a car in \\"The Accident\\". Suffering a head injury, she is temporarily paralyzed. Fallon suddenly regains her ability to walk in time to save Little Blake from falling into the swimming pool. Although able to walk again, she is plagued by painful headaches and occasional seizures. Fallon and Jeff decide to remarry in \\"The Birthday\\", but on the eve of her wedding in \\"The Nightmare\\", Fallon suffers a particularly severe headache. After she fails to appear at the altar, Jeff goes to her room to investigate, only to find her wedding dress crumpled in the corner and the room empty. He glances out the window in time to see Fallon's car speeding off into the night. As Fallon speeds down the rainy highway, she screams as she barrels toward an oncoming truck. Season 5 Jeff discovers the wreckage of Fallon's car, but no sign of her. He finds a trucker who gave her a ride to Portland and continues to search for her, suspecting that she is traveling with Peter. In \\"Fallon\\", Jeff learns that Peter died when his small twin-engine plane crashed. Investigators tell Jeff that the badly burned remains of a woman were found with him. Jeff goes to make an identification of the body and recognizes Fallon's engagement ring. Heartbroken, Jeff lashes out at her memorial service. Months later, in \\"Kidnapped\\", an amnesiac Fallon appears at a Los Angeles police station, calling herself Randall Adams. Desperately trying to learn her identity, she asks about missing person reports and disheartened to learn that no one is looking for her. In the season finale, \\"Randall\\" decides to leave Los Angeles, telling a sympathetic police detective that she feels drawn to the mountains—perhaps Denver. Season 6 In \\"The Aftermath\\", Fallon notices the name \\"Miles Colby\\" in the newspaper and feels a glimmer of recognition. She tracks down and meets Miles, an irresponsible playboy, who is also Jeff's cousin. Miles has no idea that \\"Randall\\" is the presumed-dead Fallon, and he quickly falls in love with her. Blake, in a new business deal with Miles' father Jason Colby, invites the Colbys of California to Denver to celebrate in \\"The Titans\\". Fallon has a strong reaction as she and Miles arrive at the Carrington mansion, and she insists that they leave immediately. They drive off without going inside, but not before Jeff, who has long suspected that Fallon might be alive, sees her in the courtyard. In the November 20, 1985 episode \\"The Decision\\", Jeff vows to find Fallon and never let her go. The Colbys A newly married Miles and Fallon arrive at the Colby mansion in the November 20, 1985 premiere of the spin-off series The Colbys. Jeff is there, but an amnesiac Fallon shows no recognition for him, or her father Blake, in \\"Conspiracy of Silence\\". The family decides not to tell Fallon her true identity, and to let her memory return on its own. Jeff, however, tries to subtly jog her memory, and introduces her to her young son L.B. In \\"The Family Album\\", she sees herself in a photo album, and L.B. identifies her as \\"Mommy\\". Realizing that she is Fallon, she confronts Miles and Jeff. A psychiatrist helps her regain her memory in \\"A House Divided\\", and she is torn between her feelings for Miles and Jeff. A patient Miles, also upset by his father's apparent extramarital love for Jeff's mother, finally explodes and forces himself on Fallon in \\"Thursday's Child\\". Fallon flees to Denver in the February 1986 Dynasty episode \\"Souvenirs\\", and Miles follows, seeking her forgiveness. Fallon and Miles sign papers annulling their marriage in The Colbys episode \\"The Pact\\", and Jeff and Fallon are brought closer when L.B. is hospitalized. She agrees to marry Jeff in \\"Fallon's Choice\\", and a devastated Miles uses evidence provided by his mother Sable to remove Jeff from Colby Enterprises by proving in court that his father is not Philip Colby. The plan backfires in \\"Burden of Proof\\" when Miles' father Jason declares in open court that he is Jeff's father as well. Fallon and Jeff remarry in \\"The Wedding\\", and Miles and Jeff call a truce. In the season one finale \\"Checkmate\\", Fallon tells Jeff that she is pregnant, but is soon alarmed to realize that the baby may have been fathered by Miles during the rape. Jeff and Fallon tell Miles about their baby in the season 2 premiere \\"The Gathering Storm\\", and Fallon admits to a furious Jeff that Miles could be the father in \\"No Exit\\". Miles marries a reporter, Channing Carter, who is threatened by Miles' lingering feelings for Fallon. Visiting Denver in the Dynasty episode \\"Romance\\", Fallon warns her younger sister Amanda, who is romantically involved with Fallon's former lover Michael Culhane, that Michael is not to be trusted. Sable discovers that Miles may be the father of Fallon's baby in \\"Bloodlines\\", and tells him in \\"Deceptions\\". Miles and Jeff have a brutal fight, during which Miles is almost killed by falling off the roof of the Colby Tower in \\"And Baby Makes Four\\". After Fallon threatens abortion to end the rivalry between Jeff and Miles, she and Jeff resolve to acknowledge Miles' rights should he prove to be the father. Fallon has a medical emergency at the Colby lodge in \\"Reaching Out\\", and Channing pretends the phone line is down in hopes that Fallon will lose her baby. The women remain at odds, but just when Channing is trying to make amends in \\"All Fall Down\\", Fallon falls down the stairs in a manner which looks like Channing pushed her. Miles is by Fallon's side as she gives birth to a daughter in \\"Guilty Party\\"; after a medical scare, the baby is determined to be Jeff's in \\"Fallon's Baby\\". Fallon makes friends with Channing and tries to help her with Miles, as Fallon and Jeff are finally happy. In the series finale \\"Crossroads\\", Fallon's car suddenly shuts down while she is driving down a deserted road. Leaving her car, she sees a UFO, which she boards before it takes off with her inside. Season 8 In the Dynasty season premiere \\"The Siege - Part 1\\", Jeff finds Fallon miles away from her car. In Denver, she eventually confides her UFO story to Jeff, but his disbelief puts a strain on their marriage. Their relationship is put under further pressure as Jeff becomes Blake's campaign manager in his run for governor of Colorado. Jeff's growing closeness to Fallon's cousin Leslie Carrington finally pushes Fallon to ask for a divorce in \\"The Fair\\". Blake puts Adam, Fallon, and Steven jointly in charge of Denver-Carrington during his gubernatorial race, and the siblings are soon at odds. Blake is implicated in an illegal weapons deal, but Fallon and Steven retrieve proof that he is innocent in \\"The Trial\\". Jeff has been secretly dating Steven's ex-wife Sammy Jo Carrington, and asks her to marry him in \\"The Proposal\\". Fallon confronts Jeff and they fall into bed in \\"Colorado Roulette\\", after which Sammy Jo arrives with champagne to accept Jeff's proposal. Season 9 Jeff moves forward with his engagement to Sammy Jo but is conflicted over his feelings for Fallon. A body is discovered in a lake on the Carrington property, which turns out to be the decades-old corpse of Alexis' lover, Roger Grimes. In \\"Alexis in Blunderland\\", Sammy Jo finds out about Jeff and Fallon's one-night stand. She confronts Fallon and they fight in the mud, eventually realizing that neither of them wants Jeff anymore. Fallon becomes romantically involved with John Zorelli, the police detective investigating the Grimes case. This puts her at odds with Blake, but Zorelli's investigation also makes it difficult for Fallon and the detective to trust each other. In \\"Blasts from the Past\\", Fallon recalls that as a child, she killed Grimes to prevent him from attacking an unconscious Alexis. Her grandfather, Tom Carrington, had disposed of the body in a mine under the lake to protect her. In the series finale \\"Catch 22\\", Fallon and her half-sister Krystina are trapped in a cave-in inside the mine. The Reunion (1991) Three years later in Dynasty: The Reunion, Fallon is living in California with Miles. After Jeff helps the Carringtons defeat the insidious Consortium, he and Fallon reconcile. =Reception= People praised Samms as a successful replacement in 1985, but David Hofstede called her the \\"Worst. Recast. Ever.\\" in 2004, blaming the producers rather than Samms. A 1985 article in The Hollywood Reporter criticized the recast, and a spokesman for the show told Redbook, \\"People have gotten hung up on the fact that Emma doesn't look anything like Pamela Sue. But the creators said, 'Look, that's not what we wanted to do. We needed someone who could capture the character.'\\" Hofstede wrote that \\"Samms never settled into the role, and could only make the best of a bad situation as her character was dropped into one ridiculous plotline after another.\\" Reboot Elizabeth Gillies portrays Fallon in the 2017 reboot series. A pilot for a Dynasty reboot for The CW was announced in September 2016. Elizabeth Gillies was cast as Fallon in February 2017, and the series premiered on October 11, 2017. In the new Dynasty, Fallon meets—and immediately loathes—her billionaire father Blake's fiancée Cristal, a rival employee at the family company. The reboot establishes the character's full name as Fallon Morell Carrington. =Characterization= Executive producer Josh Schwartz said of Fallon: Alexandra Jacobs of The New York Times noted that in the new series, \\"Fallon has been upgraded from a somewhat lost soul, climbing in and out of beds and winsomely up trees...to an ambitious businesswoman, still sleeping with the chauffeur but now also leaning in with a steely glare.\\" Gillies said, \\"I'm not playing Alexis but Fallon has inherited a lot of her gusto...She's less passive than at least Pamela Sue Martin was—she had a relaxed nature. I wouldn’t say that my Fallon is as relaxed, for better or for worse. I think she's got a lot more bite.\\" She said, \\"I wanted to bring my own thing to her. I think she's feisty as ever.\\" Calling Fallon \\"strong-willed\\" and \\"ambitious\\", Gillies later added, \\"She's a force of nature...Fallon will go as far as she needs to go to get exactly what she wants. She's her father's daughter, so she's a master manipulator. But I do believe she has a conscience.\\" Ahead of season two, Executive producer Sallie Patrick said, \\"Pamela Sue Martin was fantastic on the original series, and I always loved her character, but at the same time there wasn’t much there [for her to do]. She was promiscuous, and Daddy's girl, and a troublemaker for sure, but we've really enjoyed adding layers to that character in our first season, and this season, especially, she's become more complex and flawed, and the glue of the family.\\" =Storylines= Season one In the premiere episode \\"I Hardly Recognized You\\", heiress Fallon Carrington is unhappy to find her billionaire father Blake engaged to Cristal Flores. Fallon's plan to drive a wedge between them backfires, pushing up the wedding and securing Cristal the promotion to chief operating officer Fallon wanted for herself. Feeling underappreciated by Blake, Fallon sets herself up as his business rival, backed by Blake's nemesis, Jeff Colby. She is also sexually involved with the Carrington chauffeur, Michael Culhane. In \\"Guilt is for Insecure People\\", Blake blocks Fallon's use of the Carrington name for her new business venture, so she looks for leverage over him. She leaks a sex video of Cristal and her former lover Matthew Blaisdel to the press in \\"Private as a Circus\\". After her overconfidence costs her a lucrative contract, Fallon realizes she has to accept Jeff's input as well as his money. Blake learns that Fallon leaked Cristal's video in \\"Company Slut\\", and kicks her out of the mansion. In \\"I Exist Only for Me\\", Fallon is jealous that Michael is dating Kori Rucks, but their relationship withstands Fallon's meddling. Exiled from the Carrington Thanksgiving celebration by Blake, Fallon appears at Michael's church congregation dinner and meets his parents in \\"A Taste of Your Own Medicine\\". In \\"The Best Things in Life\\", Michael's relationship with Kori implodes over his lingering feelings for Fallon, who rebounds with Jeff. Fallon has a falling out with her best friend, Jeff's sister Monica Colby, in \\"Rotten Things\\". In \\"A Well-Dressed Tarantula\\", Fallon overcomes her reluctance to fully commit herself and her money to Jeff, but he is only marrying Fallon to secure her assets—especially her shares in Carrington Atlantic—for himself. Fallon helps Blake and Cristal turn the tables on Cristal's criminal brother-in-law Alejandro Raya, but is in turn abducted by Cristal's sister, Iris. Alejandro and Iris hold Fallon for ransom in \\"I Answer to No Man\\", and a captive Cristal helps Fallon escape. In \\"Nothing But Trouble\\", Monica manipulates Fallon into accepting Jeff's marriage proposal, but Fallon discovers Jeff's duplicity and enlists Michael to help her against the Colbys. Their attempt to erase the data Jeff has stolen from the Carrington server fails in \\"The Gospel According to Blake Carrington\\", and Jeff's father Cesil Colby reveals to Fallon the crimes that Blake has committed against the Colbys. In \\"Our Turn Now\\", the Carringtons proceed with preparations for Fallon's wedding to Jeff as a distraction from their second attempt to erase Jeff's server. Jeff presents Fallon with full ownership of their company Morell Co and a plan for them to exchange 25% of Carrington Atlantic and Colby. On the eve of the wedding, Fallon asks Michael to marry her at the city hall, but he refuses, not wanting something so important to be part of a Carrington plot. With Fallon and Jeff at the altar and the server still not breached, Blake tries to stop the ceremony, but Fallon shuts him down. Afterward, she reveals to the stunned Colbys and her family that the marriage is invalid because she married someone else, Liam Ridley, the night before. Jeff's claim to 25% of Carrington Atlantic is therefore null and void, but Fallon now owns 25% of Colby. Jeff and Fallon's feud goes public in \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\". Blake apologizes to Fallon and Steven for manipulating them, and his long-absent ex-wife Alexis—Fallon and Steven's mother—reappears. Fallon makes overtures to connect with her mother in \\"Enter Alexis\\", and Alexis tells Fallon that Blake bribed a judge to seize custody and exile her. Fallon soon discovers, however, that Alexis has not been living a life of luxury abroad, but is housed in a trailer nearby, and has stayed in touch with Steven. A furious Fallon confronts Alexis, and their catfight takes them into the pool. In \\"Don't Con a Con Artist\\", Steven refuses to believe Fallon's claim that Alexis is trying to sabotage Steven's engagement until Fallon manipulates Alexis into confessing. Fallon agrees to a date with Liam in \\"Use or Be Used\\", but cuts him loose when Alexis reveals that Liam is a journalist named Jack Lowden writing a tell-all. Fallon and Cristal work together to secure leverage over Blake in \\"A Line from the Past\\". Intending to publicly force her father to take responsibility for an environmental scandal he covered up, Fallon is dumbstruck when Blake announces her promotion to COO in Cristal's place. In \\"Trashy Little Tramp\\", Blake thwarts Fallon's plans for Carrington Atlantic. She visits Claudia looking for incriminating information on Blake, which she uses in a secret meeting with the Carrington Atlantic board. In \\"Dead Scratch\\", Fallon is named Carrington Atlantic's CEO, while Jeff and Monica reveal their Carrington heritage as the children of Blake's half-sister, and declare their intention to force a sale of the company. The Carringtons are trapped in the burning stable house during Steven and Sam's wedding, but Michael rescues Blake, Fallon, and Sam. Season two In the season two premiere episode, \\"Twenty-Three Skidoo\\", Fallon resumes her relationship with Michael but still has to pretend to be married to Liam to convince Liam's uncle, Max, to buy Carrington Atlantic. Max threatens to call off the deal if Fallon does not sleep with him in \\"Ship of Vipers\\", but he dies during a tryst with a prostitute Fallon hires to impersonate her. Meanwhile, Michael retrieves a signed document of the sale of Carrington Atlantic. The only copy Max Van Kirk signed before his death. Unbeknownst to Fallon, Michael has put himself on the line to get that copy for her. Liam, seeing that he may not have any chance with Fallon anymore, now that the company has been sold, releases photos of Fallon and Michael to the media. This doesn’t look good on Fallon’s image as she is supposedly married to Liam to the world. Fallon then plans a divorce party for herself and Liam, claiming it would stop the rumors. Liam confessed that he leaked the pictures because he’s fighting for her. He gives a speech about how he hates (loves) her, and Fallon kisses him. She flees the scene and Liam goes after her. They are making out when Fallon sees Michael on the CCTV. Colby walks in on them. Liam storms out. Fallon tells Colby that she’s confused because Michael is keeping secrets. Jeff Colby tells Fallon that Michael is doing right by her. Because he knows that Michael decided to work with Ada just to save Fallon and get her the document signed by Max Van Kirk. Fallon decides to tell Liam off. She tells him that what she has with Culhane is real. Liam tells her not to call him again. =Reception= James Poniewozik of The New York Times wrote that \\"Gillies seizes the screen as the lusty, ambitious Fallon.\\" Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly noted that \\"Elizabeth Gillies channels [Joan] Collins' carnivorous ambition and Leighton Meester's imperial pout.\\" References Category:Crossover characters in television Category:Dynasty (franchise) characters Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional characters from Colorado Category:Fictional female businesspeople Category:Fictional managers Category:Fictional socialites Category:Television characters introduced in 1981 Category:Fictional sexual assault victims ","title":"Fallon Carrington"},{"id":"10733067","text":"Nariño is a municipality and town of Colombia in the department of Cundinamarca.

Portrayed by Lee Bergere, the character is introduced in the series' 1981 pilot episode as the majordomo of Denver oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe). Joseph is consistently caught up in the melodrama of the Carrington family, and his daughter, Kirby (Kathleen Beller), is introduced in 1982. Bergere was written out of the series at the beginning of the fourth season in 1983. In The CW's 2017 reboot of the series, Anders is portrayed by Alan Dale. Appearances Lee Bergere debuted as Joseph in the Dynasty pilot episode, \\"Oil\\" (1981), and was written out in the second episode of the fourth season, \\"The Bungalow\\" (1983). The role is one of Bergere's best-known. Alan Dale began playing the character, more commonly referred to as \\"Anders\\", in the 2017 pilot of the Dynasty reboot. Original series =Storylines= Season one Denver oil tycoon Blake Carrington introduces his fiancée—and former secretary—Krystle to the household in \\"Oil\\". Longtime Carrington majordomo Joseph is staunchly loyal to Blake, and immediately dislikes Krystle, to whom he is dismissive until reproached by Blake's son, Steven. In \\"The Honeymoon\\", Krystle is having problems adjusting to life as a wealthy woman, made especially challenging by the imperious Joseph. Krystle rises to the challenge. Season two Joseph displays a deep loathing for Blake's first wife Alexis, who has returned to Denver after being exiled by Blake years before. Blake loses his sight in a car bombing; his vision returns in \\"The Hearing\\", but he hides his recovery from everyone except Joseph. Season three In \\"Mark\\", Joseph wants to quit his job at the mansion to help his daughter, Kirby, in France. She comes to Denver instead in \\"Kirby\\", and in \\"Acapulco\\" Joseph warns Kirby away from Jeff Colby, who is married to Blake's daughter Fallon. Joseph then warns Jeff away from Kirby in \\"The Locket\\". Jeff and Fallon divorce, and Jeff marries Kirby in Reno, Nevada in \\"Fathers and Sons\\". Joseph is angry to learn of the marriage in \\"The Downstairs Bride\\". Kirby is pregnant, and Alexis threatens Joseph that she will tell Kirby \\"the truth\\" about her mother in \\"The Threat\\". In the season three finale \\"The Cabin\\", Krystle and Alexis are trapped in a cabin, which someone sets on fire. Season four Krystle and Alexis survive. In \\"The Bungalow\\", someone tries to kill Alexis in the hospital, and Joseph kills himself by way of a self-inflicted gunshot. In \\"The Note\\", Blake and Jeff find a note in which Joseph confesses to setting the cabin fire to kill Alexis. Reboot =Casting and development= Dale was cast in the pilot in March 2017. Executive producer Sallie Patrick said that with Anders and Carrington chauffeur Michael Culhane, \\"we introduce the theme of upstairs/downstairs, because how can you have a show about the filthy rich without including the people who try their damnedest to keep them clean?\\" Of Anders and Cristal Carrington's nephew Sam Jones, she said, \\"We've introduced their friendship, and I totally 'ship them together. Locking them in the basement [in \\"A Taste of Your Own Medicine\\"] was so much fun ... Sammy Jo is always getting in over his head, so it made sense for him to be the first one knocked out. And the funniest person to lock him in the basement with seemed to be Anders.\\" Before the premiere of season two, Patrick previewed the introduction of Anders's daughter Kirby (Maddison Brown): =Storylines= Season one Carrington majordomo Joseph Anders (Alan Dale) is protective of the family, and threatened by Cristal's presence as the new would-be mistress of the mansion. After the wedding in \\"I Hardly Recognized You\\", Anders warns Cristal that he has investigated her sordid past and will reveal the details to Blake if she steps out of line. In \\"Guilt is for Insecure People\\", Anders merges Cristal's meager assets with Blake's per the terms of their prenuptial agreement, effectively making her unable spend any money without Anders knowing. In \\"Company Slut\\", Anders manipulates Sam to keep Steven away from his ex-boyfriend, Ted Dinard, a recovering drug addict whom Blake and Anders had previously pushed out of Steven's life. In \\"The Best Things in Life\\", Anders discreetly helps Cristal pay off someone from her past, but goes to Blake when he catches her in a lie. Anders and Cristal discover that Cristal's sister Iris Machado was behind the extortion plot in \\"Rotten Things\\". On Blake's behalf, Anders bribes a prison guard to stage an attack intended to prevent Cesil Colby from being paroled in \\"Nothing But Trouble\\". After Sam reveals in \\"The Gospel According to Blake Carrington\\" that he is in the country illegally, Anders sets him up with an immigration lawyer to begin the citizenship process. In \\"A Line from the Past\\", Anders tells Sam that he has an ex-wife and a daughter, Kirby, in Australia. Anders moves to call her, but hangs up. Sam invites Kirby to his wedding to Steven in \\"Dead Scratch\\", before learning from Steven and Fallon that as a child she was a \\"psychopath\\" who tormented Fallon. Later, Anders is surprised to find Kirby arriving at the mansion. Season two Anders keeps Kirby at a distance from the Carringtons in \\"Twenty-Three Skidoo\\", and father and daughter clash over her wild lifestyle and his mistrust. =Reception= Dale has received praise for the role, and Maureen Ryan of Variety called him \\"the best aspect of the new version of Dynasty\\", noting that \\"Dale improves every scene he's in.\\" Patrick said, \\"Alan Dale is amazing as Anders.

Beginning in 1976, Wright studied with Ted Berrigan and Alice Notley at St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery. He also studied with Allen Ginsberg at Brooklyn College and received an MFA in poetry from there. Biography =Poetry and performance= In the late 1970s Wright performed at PS122's avant-garde- arama. He read often at St. Mark's Poetry Project between 1979 and 1990 and served a three-year term on the Project Board of Directors. In 1996, Wright performed in two Museum of Modern Art's poetry series events curated by the late philanthropist and poetry activist Lita Hornick. In the millennial years, he hosted poetry events at the Bowery Poetry Club, La MaMa E.T.C., KGB and other Village venues. In 2013, Wright wrote the poetry-play Clubhouse on East 13th Street, which was performed at La MaMa E.T.C. and elsewhere. In 2014 he and Lily White completed a 40-minute video about a community garden issue that documented his eponymous performance The Key Ceremony. Wright is the author of 13 books of poetry. His poems also appear in six anthologies including Out of This World from Crown Press and Thus Spake the Corpse from Black Sparrow Press. He is well known for collaborative activities, including his postcard series. In 2012, he participated in One Hundred Thousand Poets for Change. He is also a long-time member of Brevitas, a community of invited poets who email one to two original poems (14 lines maximum) to the group on the 1st and 15th of each month and publish a periodic selection. The Brooklyn Rail published a suite of his poems in 2011. =Publishing= In 1978 Wright started Hard Press, where he published three books, including the anthology 3-Zero, Turning Thirty, and 100 postcards by different artists and poets. A selection of the postcards were included in the book A Secret Location on the Lower East Side, and were displayed at New York Public Library. From 1986 until 2001 Wright published 80 issues of Cover Magazine, The Underground National, with the help of estimable artist and writer contributors including Timothy Greenfield- Sanders, Steve Mumford, Sue Scott, Judd Tully, and John Yau. The magazine covered a broad range of arts and culture, profiling many important artists in advance of their heyday. Among others, Wright and Cover editors covered Steve Buscemi, Penny Arcade, Chakaia Booker, Andrea Zittel, Dawoud Bey, Sarah McLachlan, The Cranberries, and artists such as Andres Serrano, Vik Muniz and Doug and Mike Starn. The magazine's interviews with Paul Bowles, William Burroughs, and Rufino Tamayo are among the last. Cover is archived at Fales Library at New York University. Wright started Live Mag! in 2007 in response to an invitation from Bob Holman to create an event at the Bowery Poetry Club. Wright's idea was to unite poetry publication in multiple forms: performance, electronic, and print. The magazine is primarily Wright's curation of current poetry and visual art.Live Mag!

British musician Mike Rutherford produced their first album, played bass on several songs and may have also sung in the choir on one song, \\"The Way\\". The three core members were Michael Becker, Gene Stashuk and Paul Revelli. Don Gehmann mixed the single \\"Relentless\\" from the first CD, David Tickle was the engineer. Red 7 recorded two albums. Their self-titled debut Red 7 was released in 1985 (MCA LP MCA-5508). Two cuts from that album were used in popular movies: \\"Less Than Perfect\\" was featured in the soundtrack to Joe Dante's 1985 film, Explorers (Explorers: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack, MCA LP MCA-6148). Arguably their best-known song, \\"Heartbeat\\", was featured in Michael Mann's 1986 thriller Manhunter, as well as an episode of Miami Vice. The second album, When the Sun Goes Down (MCA LP MCA-5792) was released in 1987. The band lost their contract to MCA soon after the second album, and disappeared from public interest. After the demise of Red 7, the members scattered to various corners of the country. Gene Stashuk currently owns and operates Apostrophe Music Studios in Washington State, where he produces and engineers a wide variety of contemporary music, rock to classical. With his own group, euGENE WENDELL, he has produced three CDs (euGENE WENDELL, Islands in the Sun and euGENE WENDELL 3). He is also a FOH mixer at many local music festivals and events. Paul Revelli continues to produce music and play drums in the San Francisco Bay Area. He has appeared with an interesting variety of artists including Elvis Costello and Chuck Prophet. He currently plays with the blues group Bey Paule Band. Michael Becker returned to his beloved home state of New Jersey and presumably continues to play keyboards.

It is managed by Buckinghamshire Council, formerly County Council.Country Parks - Buckinghamshire County Council It has an area of , of which two separate areas totalling have been designated a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). and a larger area of 66 hectares is a Local Nature Reserve. Wildlife Black Park SSSI has heath, alder carr – both rare in the county – mixed and coniferous woodland and some areas of acid grassland. It has a varied fauna, and insects include the nationally rare Roesel's bush cricket. There are eighteen species of butterfly, birds including hobbies and nightjars, and snakes and lizards.  Filming location  Black Park is adjacent to Pinewood Film Studios and has been used as an outdoor location for many film and television productions. The woods and lake featured prominently in the Hammer Horror films from the late 1950s to the 1970s, including The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), The Brides of Dracula (1960), The Curse of the Werewolf (1961) and Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966).Wayne Kinsey (2002) Hammer Films: The Bray Studio Years. London: Reynolds and Hearn In these films the location was often used to represent Transylvania. The park has also been used in film productions such as the James Bond film Goldfinger, where it was used for a night car chase scene (actually set in Switzerland and featuring Bond's Aston Martin DB5), and the 2006 version of Casino Royale, plus several Carry On films, Fahrenheit 451, Wombling Free, Batman, Hawk the Slayer, Sleepy Hollow, Bugsy Malone, the Harry Potter film series, Cinderella (2015 film), Captain America: The First Avenger, Robin Hood, 47 Ronin, Eden Lake, the Monty Python film And Now for Something Completely Different, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and Jurassic World: Dominion. In television, Black Park, together with its lake, was used extensively in location filming for Doctor Who, and was employed again two years later in the recording of the Restoration-era set serial The Visitation. Dressed with fake cobwebs, it was also used for the filming of the early Blake's 7 episode The Web. In 1974 it depicted the planet Retha in the episode \\"The Full Circle\\" in the first series of Space 1999.  Recreation and sports  Black Park is popular with walkers and dog owners due to the wide open spaces and well-maintained routes. During summer 2010 a 'Go-Ape' activity centre was established in the park with the construction of climbing rigging and zip lines between the trees. The area is properly supervised by park staff during opening hours. The Go Ape team now offers cycle hire and Go Ape Nets, allowing even younger visitors a chance to climb high into the treetops. Runners are commonplace within the park and the increase in private persons using the park for exercise/training has led to the establishment of a Parkrun event on Saturday mornings.http://www.parkrun.org.uk/blackpark/ Park Run Black Park events The professionally organised events are free to enter and form part of a network of nationwide parkruns. Mountain biking is popular in the park as the combination of dense woodland, open plains, technical sections and narrow but quick draining trails make for exciting riding. The lake is open for fishing during the normal rod licence season, though pre-baiting, keep nets and night fishing are all forbidden. The park sells day tickets and annual permits at appropriate times of year. Black Park at war During both World War One and Two the Park saw service for the Empire with troops from the Canadian Forestry Regiment helping to farm the Park and harvest the wood, for use in the trenches of France or building air strips in France for the Royal Flying Corps. To this day the lines of trees they planted can still be clearly seen. Sadly one of the Forestry Regiment never went home after being killed in a road traffic accident on the nearby Crooked Billet Roundabout. He is buried in the nearby St Margaret's Church, Iver Heath. Since 2007 the local Scout Group, 1st Iver Heath have laid poppies on his grave, as part of the Centenary of Scouting and an event called 'Uniform Day 007' that featured a representative of the Canadian Army who helped the Scouts' routine of laying a wreath for this young soldier many miles from home. On the fields between the park and Iver Heath near Pinewood Studios, a World War One fighter crashed on its way to France after stopping off in Iver Heath. In World War Two a V2 rocket fell very close by the site of the fighter's location. The Park was also used to store military supplies hidden amongst the trees from enemy surveillance, as was nearby Langley Park. Geology The park is the type site for Black Park Gravel Member, a layer of sand and gravel dating to the Anglian ice age, around 450,000 years ago.

Biography Naworth Castle, seat of the Dacre family Thomas was the son and heir of William Dacre, 5th Baron Dacre of Gilsland (c. 1357–1399), and Joan Douglas, the illegitimate daughter of William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas. He was born at Naworth Castle, Cumberland, on 27 October 1387, and baptized the following day in Brampton church. Thomas received livery of his father's lands at age 21 on 10 November 1408, and was summoned to parliament from 1 December 1412 as 'Thomas Dacre of Gillesland' (Gisland). He held the office Chief Forrester of Inglewood Forest. Before his father died on 20 July 1399, Dacre married Philippa Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and Margaret Stafford. Dacre became his father-in-law's ward after his father's death, as he was still under age. He died on 5 January 1458 and was buried at Lanercost Priory. His wife was still living on 8 July 1453, but predeceased her husband. Issue Thomas and Philippa had seven sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Thomas, knight, married Elizabeth Bowet, daughter and co-heiress of Sir William Bowet, and had two daughters. He was living in 1453 but predeceased his father. The second son, Randolf, was childless, slain at the Battle of Towton in 1461. Humphrey, the third son, married Mabel Parr, daughter of Sir Thomas Parr of Kendal and by her had issue. The other sons – Ralph, Richard, George, and John – are thought to have died young. The eldest daughter, Joan, married Thomas, Lord Clifford, with issue. The younger, Margaret, married John Scrope (son of John 4th Lord Scrope of Masham), without issue. After Thomas's death in 1458 his granddaughter Joan (daughter of his eldest son) and her husband Richard Fiennes were recognized as heirs to the barony of Dacre.

Nemocón, famous for its salt mine, was an important village in the Muisca Confederation, the country in the central Colombian Andes before the arrival of the Spanish. The municipality is situated in the northern part of the Bogotá savanna, part of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense with its urban centre at an altitude of and from the capital Bogotá. Nemocón is the northeasternmost municipality of the Metropolitan Area of Bogotá and the Bogotá River originates close to Nemocón. The median temperature of Nemocón is 12.8 °C. The municipality borders Tausa in the north, Suesca and Gachancipá in the east, Tocancipá and Zipaquirá in the south and in the west the rivers Checua and Neusa and the municipality of Cogua. Official website Nemocón  Etymology  Nemocón is derived from Enemocón and means \\"The cry or sadness of the warrior\\" in the Chibcha language. Another etymology is that the town is named after zipa Nemequene.Espejo Olaya, 1999, p.1121  History  = Prehistory = Archaeological evidence surfaced by Gonzalo Correal Urrego in 1979 and Ana María Groot in 1992 has shown that Nemocón was inhabited early in the history of inhabitation of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense.

An additional six people were injured jumping from windows to escape. Cho was a senior-level undergraduate student at the university and committed suicide after police breached the doors of Norris Hall, where most of the shooting had taken place. His body is buried in Fairfax, Virginia. Born in South Korea, Cho was eight years old when he immigrated to the United States with his family.

During Cho's last two years at Virginia Tech, several instances of his abnormal behavior, as well as plays and other writings he submitted containing references to violence, caused concern among teachers and classmates. In the aftermath of the shootings, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine convened a panel consisting of various officials and experts to investigate and examine the response and handling of issues related to the shootings. The panel released its final report in August 2007, devoting more than 20 pages to detailing Cho's troubled history. In the report, the panel criticized the failure of the educators and mental health professionals who came into contact with Cho during his college years to notice his deteriorating condition and help him. The panel also criticized misinterpretations of privacy laws and gaps in Virginia's mental health system and gun laws. In addition, the panel faulted Virginia Tech administrators in particular for failing to take immediate action after the first shootings.

At that time, according to Kim, nobody disliked Cho and he \\"was recognized by friends as a boy of knowledge [ ⁠and ⁠] a good dresser who was popular with the girls.\\" Kim added that \\"I only have good memories about him.\\" An acquaintance noted that \\"Every time he came home from school he would cry and throw tantrums saying he never wanted to return to school\\" when Cho first came to the U.S. in about the second grade.Moran, T.

During the spring of Cho's eighth-grade year in 1999, the Columbine High School massacre made international news and Cho was transfixed by it. \\"I remember sitting in Spanish class with him, right next to him, and there being something written on his binder to the effect of, you know, ' 'F' you all, I hope you all burn in hell,' which I would assume meant us, the students,\\" said Ben Baldwin, a classmate of Cho. Cho also wrote in a school assignment about wanting to \\"repeat Columbine\\". The school contacted Cho's sister, who reported the incident to their parents. Cho was sent to a psychiatrist. Cho attended two secondary schools in Fairfax County: Ormond Stone Middle School in Centreville and Westfield High School in Chantilly. By the eighth grade, he had been diagnosed with selective mutism, a social anxiety disorder that inhibited him from speaking in specific instances and/or to specific individuals. Throughout high school, he was bullied for his shyness and unusual speech patterns. According to Chris Davids, a high school classmate in Cho's English class at Westfield High School, Cho looked down and refused to speak when called upon. Davids added that, after one teacher threatened to give Cho a failing grade for not participating in class, he began reading in a strange, deep voice that sounded \\"like he had something in his mouth.\\" While several students recalled instances of Cho being bullied and mocked at Westfield, most left him alone and later said they were not aware of his anger.

The Virginia Tech Review Panel report dismissed an autism diagnosis and experts later doubted the autism claim. More than four months after the attack, The Wall Street Journal reported on August 20, 2007, that Cho had been diagnosed with selective mutism. The Virginia Tech Review Panel report, also released in August 2007, placed this diagnosis in the spring of Cho's eighth- grade year, and his parents sought treatment for him through medication and therapy. In high school, Cho was placed in special education under the \\"emotional disturbance\\" classification. He was excused from oral presentations and participation in class conversation and received 50 minutes a month of speech therapy. He continued receiving mental health therapy as well until his junior year, when Cho rejected further therapy. To address his problems, Cho's parents also took him to church. According to a pastor at the Centreville Korean Presbyterian Church, Cho was a smart student who understood the Bible, but he was concerned about Cho's difficulty in speaking to people. The pastor added that, until he saw the video that Cho sent to NBC News, he never heard him say a complete sentence.

After Giovanni was informed of the massacre, she remarked that \\"[I] knew when it happened that that's probably who it was,\\" and \\"would have been shocked if it wasn't.\\" Roy had taught Cho in Introduction to Poetry the previous year.

Roy declined to comment on Cho's writings, saying only in general that they \\"seemed very angry.\\" She added that Cho, when called on in class, would take twenty seconds to answer questions, and whispered his response. He also took cell phone pictures of her in class. After Roy became concerned with Cho's behavior and the themes in his writings, she started meeting with Cho to work with him one-on-one. However, she soon became concerned for her safety, and told her assistant that she would use the name of a dead professor as a duress code, in order to alert the assistant to call security. After Roy notified authorities of Cho's behavior, she urged Cho to seek counseling, but to her knowledge, Cho never followed through with the request, in spite of his insistence to the contrary. Creative writing professor Lisa Norris taught Cho in both Advanced Fiction Writing and Contemporary Fiction, and was familiar with his disturbing demeanor. When Mary Ann Lewis, associate dean for Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, asked Norris about Cho's behavior, it became apparent that Lewis had been unaware that Cho was suffering from mental health problems and harassing female students. According to Norris, \\"my guess is that either the information was not accessible to her [Lewis] or it was privileged and could not be released to me.\\" Lewis told Norris to recommend that Cho seek counseling at the on-campus Cook Counseling Center, as Lewis had already done. = Relationship with students = Fellow students described Cho as a \\"quiet\\" person who \\"would not respond if someone greeted him.\\" Student Julie Poole recalled the first day of a literature class the previous year when the students introduced themselves one by one.

Poole added that \\"we just really knew him as the question mark kid\\". Karan Grewal, who shared a suite with Cho at Harper Hall, reported that Cho \\"would sit in a wood rocker by the window [in his room at the dormitory]; and stare at the lawn below\\".

Koch and Eide claimed that Cho had been involved in at least three stalking incidents, two of which resulted in verbal warnings by the Virginia Tech campus police. The first such alleged stalking incident occurred on November 27, 2005. After the incident, according to Koch, Cho claimed to have sent an instant message online to the female student by AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and found out where she lived on the campus. Eide stated that Cho then visited her room to see if she was \\"cool\\", adding that Cho remarked that he only found \\"promiscuity in her eyes\\". Eide added that, when Cho visited the female student, Cho said, \\"Hi, I'm Question Mark\\" to her, \\"which really freaked her out.\\" The female student called the campus police, complaining that Cho had sent her annoying messages and made an unannounced visit to her room. Two uniformed members of the campus police visited Cho's room at the dormitory later that evening and warned him not to contact the female student again. Cho made no further contact with the student. The final alleged stalking incident came to light on December 13, 2005. In the preceding days, Cho had contacted a female friend of Koch via AIM and wrote on her door board a line from Act 2, Scene II of the Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet. In the passage, Romeo laments to Juliet \\"[b] a name, I know not how to tell who I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, because it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word.\\" The young woman was initially unconcerned by Cho's AIM messages and the Romeo and Juliet quotation until she was contacted by Andy Koch via AIM. Koch informed her of Cho's previous earlier stalking incident and told her, \\"I think he is schizophrenic .\\" Encouraged by Koch, the young woman contacted the campus police, who again warned Cho against further unwanted contact. After that warning, Cho made no further contact with the second female student. Later the same day, Cho would send a text message to Koch stating, \\"I might as well kill myself now.\\" Worried that Cho was suicidal, Koch contacted his father for advice. Both contacted campus authorities. The campus police returned to the dormitory and escorted Cho to New River Valley Community Services Board, the Virginia mental health agency serving Blacksburg.Schulte, B. & Jenkins, C.L.

Virginia Special Justice Paul Barnett certified in an order that Cho \\"presented an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness,\\" but instead recommended treatment for Cho as an outpatient. On December 14, 2005, Cho was released from the mental health facility after Judge Barnett ordered Cho to undergo mental health treatment on an outpatient basis, with a directive for the \\"court-ordered [outpatient] to follow all recommended treatments.\\" Since Cho underwent only a minimal psychiatric assessment, the true diagnosis for Cho's mental health status remains unknown. Because Cho was not involuntarily committed to a mental health facility as an inpatient, he was still legally eligible to buy guns under Virginia law. However, according to Virginia law, \\"[a] magistrate has the authority to issue a detention order upon a finding that a person is mentally ill and in need of hospitalization or treatment.\\" The magistrate also must find that the person is an imminent danger to himself or others.Reid, T. (2007, April 18). Killer spent time in mental health unit. The Times(UK). Retrieved on April 17, 2007. Virginia officials and other law experts have argued that, under United States federal law, Barnett's order meant that Cho had been \\"adjudicated as a mental defective\\" and was thus ineligible to purchase firearms under federal law; and that the state of Virginia erred in not enforcing the requirements of the federal law. = Family efforts = The Virginia Tech Review Panel report shed light on numerous efforts by Cho's family to secure help for him as early as adolescence. However, when Cho reached 18 and left for college, the family lost its legal authority over him, and their influence on him waned. Cho's mother, increasingly concerned about his inattention to classwork, his classroom absences and his asocial behavior, sought help for him during summer 2006 from various churches in Northern Virginia. According to Dong Cheol Lee, minister of One Mind Presbyterian Church of Washington (located in Woodbridge), Cho's mother sought help from the church for Cho's problems. Lee added that \\"[Cho's] problem needed to be solved by spiritual power ... that's why she came to our church – because we were helping several people like him.\\" Members of Lee's church even told Cho's mother that he was afflicted by \\"demonic power\\" and needed \\"deliverance.\\" Before the church could meet with the family, however, Cho returned to school to start his senior year at Virginia Tech.  Virginia Tech shooting  Around 7:15 a.m. EDT (11:15 UTC) on April 16, 2007, Cho killed two students, Emily J. Hilscher and Ryan C. \\"Stack\\" Clark, on the fourth floor of West Ambler Johnston Hall, a high-rise co-educational dormitory. Investigators later determined that Cho's shoes matched a blood-stained print found in the hallway outside Hilscher's room. The shoes and bloody jeans were found in Cho's dormitory room where he had stashed them after the attack. Within the next two and a half hours, Cho returned to his room to rearm himself; he mailed a package to NBC News that contained pictures, digital video files and documents. At approximately 9:45 a.m. EDT (13:45 UTC), he then crossed the campus to Norris Hall, a classroom building on the campus where, in a span of nine minutes, Cho shot dozens of people, killing 30 of them. As police breached the area of the building where Cho attacked the faculty and students, Cho committed suicide in Norris 211 with a gunshot to his temple.Gelineau, K. (April 23, 2007). Cho discharged 100 rounds. Canoe Network News (Canada). Retrieved on May 6, 2007. Cho's gunshot wound destroyed his face, obscuring identification of his body for several hours. The police identified Cho by matching immigration records with the fingerprints on the guns that were used in the shootings. Before the shootings, Cho's only known connection to Norris Hall was as a student in the sociology class, which he met in a classroom on the second floor of the building. Although police had not stated positively at the time of the initial investigation that Cho was the perpetrator of the Norris Hall shootings and the earlier one at West Ambler Johnston Hall, forensic evidence confirmed that the same gun was used in both shooting incidents. = Preparation =  Weapons used in the attack  Glock 19 semi-automatic pistol Walther P22 semi-automatic pistol During February and March 2007, Cho began purchasing the weapons that he later used during the killings. On February 9, Cho purchased his first handgun, a .22 caliber Walther P22 semi-automatic pistol, from TGSCOM Inc., a federally licensed firearms dealer based in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and the operator of the website through which Cho ordered the gun. TGSCOM Inc. shipped the Walther P22 to JND Pawnbrokers in Blacksburg, Virginia, where Cho completed the legally required background check for the purchase transaction and took possession of the handgun. On March 13, Cho bought his second handgun, a 9mm Glock 19 semi-automatic pistol, from Roanoke Firearms, a licensed gun dealer located in Roanoke, Virginia. Cho was able to pass both background checks and successfully complete both handgun purchases after he presented to the gun dealers his U.S. permanent residency card, his Virginia driver's permit to prove legal age and length of Virginia residence and a checkbook showing his Virginia address, in addition to waiting the required 30-day period between each gun purchase. He was successful at completing both handgun purchases because he did not disclose on the background questionnaire that a Virginia court had ordered him to undergo outpatient treatment at a mental health facility.Schulte, B. & Horwitz, S.

On March 22, 2007, Cho purchased two 10-round magazines for the Walther P22 pistol through eBay from Elk Ridge Shooting Supplies in Idaho. Based on a preliminary computer forensics examination of Cho's eBay purchase records, investigators suspected that Cho may have purchased an additional 10-round magazine on March 23, 2007, from another eBay seller who sold gun accessories.Geller, A. & Kahn, C.

Police investigators found that Cho fired more than 170 shots during the killing spree, evidenced by technicians finding at least 17 empty magazines at the scene.Gelineau, K. (April 25, 2007). Va. Tech gunman fired 170-plus shots. The Washington Post. Retrieved on April 25, 2007. During the investigation, federal law enforcement investigators found that the serial numbers were illegally filed off on both the Walther P22 and the Glock 19 handguns used by Cho during the rampage. \\"Investigators also said that in mid-March, Cho practiced shooting at a firing range in Roanoke, about 40 miles from the campus.\\" According to a former FBI agent and ABC consultant, \\"This was no spur-of-the-moment crime. He's been thinking about this for several months prior to the shooting.\\"  Review of Cho's medical records  During the investigation, the matter of Cho's court-ordered mental health treatment was also examined to determine its outcome. Virginia investigators learned after a review of Cho's medical records that he never complied with the order for the mandated mental health treatment as an outpatient. The investigators also found that neither the court nor New River Valley Community Services exercised oversight of his case to determine his compliance with the order. In response to questions about Cho's case, New River Valley Community Services maintained that its facility was never named in the court order as the provider for his mental health treatment, and its responsibility ended once he was discharged from its care after the court order. In addition, Christopher Flynn, director of the Cook Counseling Center at Virginia Tech, mentioned that the court did not notify his office that Cho was required to seek outpatient mental health treatment. Flynn added that, \\"When a court gives a mandatory order that someone get outpatient treatment, that order is to the individual, not an agency ... The one responsible for ensuring that the mentally ill person receives help in these sort of cases ... is the mentally ill person.\\" As a result, Cho escaped compliance with the court order for mandatory mental health treatment as an outpatient, even though Virginia law required community services boards to \\"recommend a specific course of treatment and programs\\" for mental health patients and \\"monitor the person's compliance.\\" As for the court, Virginia law also mandated that, if a person fails to comply with a court order to seek mental health treatment as an outpatient, that person can be brought back before the court \\"and if found still in crisis, can be committed to a psychiatric institution for up to 180 days.\\" Cho was never summoned to court to explain why he had not complied with the December 14, 2005, order for mandatory mental health treatment as an outpatient. The investigation panel had sought Cho's medical records for several weeks, but due to privacy laws, Virginia Tech was prohibited from releasing them without permission from Cho's family, even after his death. The panel had considered using subpoenas to obtain his records. On June 12, 2007, Cho's family released his medical records to the panel, although the panel said that the records were not enough. The panel obtained additional information by court order. Cho had been prescribed paroxetine years before the shooting but had been taken off it after one year. The toxicology test from the official autopsy later showed that neither psychiatric nor any kind of illegal drugs were in his system during the time of the shooting. In August 2009, Cho's family allowed Virginia Tech to release the records, along with those found in July 2009, to the public. Previously, they were only given to the panel.  Investigative panel report  In the aftermath of the killing spree, Virginia Governor Timothy Kaine (D) appointed a panel to investigate the campus shootings, with plans for the panel to submit a report of its findings in approximately two to three months. Kaine also invited former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to join the panel to \\"review Cho's mental health history and how police responded to the tragedy.\\"Ferguson, B. (April 20, 2007). Killer video haunts campus. Arab News (Saudi Arabia). Retrieved on May 3, 2007. To help investigate and analyze the emergency response surrounding the Virginia Tech shooting, Kaine hired the same company that investigated the Columbine High School massacre. The panel's final report devoted more than 20 pages to detailing Cho's mental health history. The report criticized Virginia Tech educators, administrators and mental health staff in failing to \\"connect the dots\\" from numerous incidents that were warning signs of Cho's mental instability beginning in his junior year. The report concluded that the school's mental health systems \\"failed for lack of resources, incorrect interpretation of privacy laws, and passivity.\\" The report called Virginia's mental health laws \\"flawed\\" and its mental health services \\"inadequate\\". The report also confirmed that Cho was able to purchase two guns in violation of federal law because of Virginia's inadequate background check requirements.  Reaction of Cho's family  Cho's older sister prepared a statement on her family's behalf to apologize publicly for her brother's actions, in addition to lending prayers to the victims and the families of the wounded and killed victims. \\"This is someone that I grew up with and loved. Now I feel like I didn't know this person,\\" she said in the statement issued through a North Carolinian attorney. \\"We never could have envisioned that he was capable of so much violence.\\" Cho's grandfather stated, \\"My grandson Seung-Hui was very shy. I can't believe he did such a thing.\\" In a 2008 article marking the anniversary of the massacre, the Washington Post did a follow-up on the family, reporting that they had gone into hiding for months following the massacre and, after eventually returning home, had \\"virtually cut themselves off from the world.\\" Several windows in their home have been papered over and drawn blinds cover the rest. The only real outside contact they have maintained is with an FBI agent assigned to their care and their lawyer, refusing even to contact their own relatives in South Korea.  Media package sent to NBC News  Screenshot from the MSNBC coverage of several videos Seung-Hui Cho sent to NBC News A still of Cho holding two pistols During the time period between the two shooting events on April 16, Cho visited a local post office near the Virginia Tech campus where he mailed a parcel with a DVD inside to the New York headquarters of NBC News, which contained video clips, photographs and a manifesto explaining the reasons for his actions. The package, addressed from \\"A. Ishmael\\" as seen on an image of the USPS Express Mail envelope (incorrectly printed as \\"Ismail\\" by The New York Times) and apparently intended to be received on April 17, was delayed because of an incorrect ZIP code and street address. The words \\"Ismail Ax\\" were scrawled in red ink on Cho's arm. = Release of material = Upon receiving the package on April 18, 2007, NBC contacted authorities and made the controversial decision to publicize Cho's communications by releasing a small fraction of what it received. After pictures and images from the videos were broadcast in numerous news reports, students and faculty from Virginia Tech, along with relatives of victims of the campus shooting, expressed concerns that glorifying Cho's rampage could lead to copycat killings. The airing of the manifesto and its video images and pictures was upsetting to many who were more closely affected by the shootings: Peter Read, the father of Mary Read, one of the students who was killed by Cho during the rampage, asked the media to stop airing Cho's manifesto. Police officials, who reviewed the video, pictures and manifesto, concluded that the contents of the media package had marginal value in helping them learn and understand why Cho committed the killings.Macklin, W. (April 19, 2007). Police find marginal value in killer's manifesto; VA Tech will confer degrees on victims. AHN Media Corp. Retrieved April 19, 2007. Dr. Michael Welner, who also reviewed the materials, believed that Cho's rantings offer little insight into the mental illness that may have triggered his rampage. Dr. Welner stated that \\"These videos do not help us understand Cho. They distort him. He was meek. He was quiet. This is a PR tape of him trying to turn himself into a Quentin Tarantino character.\\" During the April 24, 2007, edition of The Oprah Winfrey Show, NBC News President Steve Capus stated NBC decided to show 2 minutes of 25 minutes of video, 7 of 43 photographs, and 37 sentences of 23 pages of written material or 5 of the 23 PDF files that were last modified at 7:24 a.m., after the first shooting. He also stated that the content not shown included \\"over the top profanity\\" and \\"incredibly violent images\\". He expressed hope that the unreleased material would never be made public. = Contents = In his manifesto, Cho mentioned the Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, and made frequent references to hedonism and Christianity while expressing anger about unspecified wrongs that were done to him.

Writings  = Plays =  Richard McBeef  In 2006, pursuant to a class assignment, Cho wrote a short one-act play entitled Richard McBeef. The play focuses on John, a thirteen-year-old boy whose father has died in a boating accident, and John's stepfather, ex-football player Richard McBeef (whom John constantly refers to as \\"Dick\\"). When Richard touches John's lap during an attempt at a 'father-to-son' talk, the boy abruptly claims that his stepfather is molesting him. John then accuses his stepfather of having murdered his biological father and repeatedly says that he will kill Richard. John, Richard and Sue (John's mother) are suddenly embroiled in a major argument. Richard then retreats to his car to escape the conflict, but John, despite claiming repeatedly that Richard is abusing him, joins his stepfather in the car and harasses him. The play ends with John trying to shove a banana-flavored cereal bar into his stepfather's throat; Richard, hitherto a passive character, reacts \\"out of sheer desecrated hurt and anger\\" by \\"swinging a deadly blow\\" at the boy.Cho Seung-hui. \\"Richard McBeef.\\" The Smoking Gun.

Mr. Brownstone  In a second play, Mr. Brownstone, written for another class assignment, Cho depicts three seventeen-year-olds (John, Jane and Joe), who sit in a casino while discussing their deep hatred for Mr. Brownstone, their 45-year- old mathematics teacher. The three characters claim—using the phrase \\"ass- rape\\"—that Mr. Brownstone mistreats them. John wins a multimillion-dollar jackpot from one of the slot machines, and Mr. Brownstone, amid volleys of profanity from the students, reports to casino officials that the three teens are underage and have illegally picked up the winning ticket.

In that paper, Cho wrote about a mass school murder that was planned by the protagonist of the story but, according to the story, the protagonist did not follow through with the killings. During the proceedings of the Virginia Tech panel, the panel was unaware of the existence of the paper written by Cho for his fiction writing class.Horwitz, S. (August 29, 2007). Paper by Cho exhibits disturbing parallels to shootings, sources say. The Washington Post. Retrieved on August 29, 2007. When information surfaced about the paper, the Virginia Tech panel learned at that time that only the Virginia State Police and Virginia Tech had copies of the unreleased paper in their possession. The Virginia State Police reported that, although it had a copy of the paper, Virginia law prevented them from releasing the paper to the panel because it was part of the investigative file in an ongoing investigation. Virginia Tech, on the other hand, had known about the paper, and officials at the school discussed the contents of the paper among themselves in the aftermath of the shootings. According to Governor Kaine, \\"[Virginia Tech] was expected to turn over all of Cho's writings to the panel\\" during the proceedings of the Virginia Tech panel. After some members of the Virginia Tech panel complained about the missing paper, Virginia Tech decided to release a copy of the paper to the panel during the latter part of the week of August 25, 2007. Although the Virginia Tech panel has since received the paper written by Cho for the fiction writing class, the precise contents of that paper have not been released to the public. = Reactions to writings = Edward Falco, a playwriting professor at Virginia Tech, has acknowledged that Cho wrote both plays in his class. The plays are fewer than 12 pages long and have several grammatical and typographical errors. Falco believed that Cho was drawn to writing because of his speech difficulties. Falco said of the plays, \\"They're not good writing, but at least they are a form of communication.\\" Another professor who taught Cho characterized his work as \\"very adolescent\\" and \\"silly\\", with attempts at \\"slapstick comedy\\" and \\"elements of violence\\".Wingert, P., Waddell, L. & Campo-Flores, A.

The final edition was published in September 2014. It was originally called TV Movies, which became Leonard Maltin's TV Movies and Video Guide, and then Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide, before arriving at its final title. Film critic Leonard Maltin edited it and contributed a large portion of its reviews. Features The book used a star rating system. The lowest rating was \\"BOMB\\", followed by one and a half stars, rising in half- star increments to a maximum of four stars, and frequently giving out two-and- a-half star ( 1/2 ) reviews. The sole exception to this was Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult, which was rated with two and one third stars out of four, referencing the film's title. Maltin did not cover direct-to-video films because of their great number (six released each week by 1994). Made-for- television films were included in the guides for many years, though in the early 2000s, Maltin gradually began to phase them out to make room for current feature film releases. All had been removed by the early 2010s, and no TV movies made after 2004 were included in new editions. Maltin used a different system for rating TV movies: \\"Below average\\", \\"Average\\" or \\"Above average\\", with select variants for highly rated films, including \\"Way above average\\" for The Day After and Special Bulletin, and \\"Outstanding\\" for Minstrel Man. Certain theatrically-released films (usually low budget, obscure, foreign, concert, or serial films), as well as the majority of films based on Edgar Wallace novels, were also removed from the guide over time to allow the inclusion of new titles. Another notable feature of the Guide was that each review included a reference to the source material for the film if it was based on previously published material. Films were listed alphabetically letter-by-letter, ignoring punctuation and spaces. Articles were also ignored and transposed to the end of the title. The Guide was notable for containing what the Guinness Book of World Records calls the world's shortest movie review. His 2 out of 4 star review of the 1948 musical Isn't It Romantic? consisted of the word \\"No\\". Another very short review concerned the film Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed where Maltin wrote, \\"It is what it is.\\" Yet another was of Are Husbands Necessary? in which he wrote \\"And what about this film?\\", and one more right behind these is Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol where, in comparing it to the previous installments, he commented, \\"More of the same, only worse.\\" Bombs Along with typically listed worst pictures of all time, the hundreds of films Maltin designated as a \\"BOMB\\" in his guide also included 3000 Miles to Graceland, 88 Minutes, College, Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, American Gigolo, the Woody Allen-directed Anything Else, The Benchwarmers, Bobby Deerfield, The Bonfire of the Vanities, Captain Ron, Celtic Pride, The Dukes of Hazzard, Endless Love, Every Which Way but Loose, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Four Rooms, 2010's Gulliver's Travels, Mame, The Missouri Breaks, Popeye, Prêt-à-Porter, 1998's remake of Psycho, 2007's remake of Sleuth, Valley of the Dolls and Your Highness. History High-school senior Leonard Maltin was a film fan and publisher of Fanzine Monthly. In spring 1968 a teacher introduced him to an editor at Signet Books, which wanted a competitor to Steven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV; impressed by Maltin's ideas for the book the editor hired him immediately, without telling others that he had hired a 17-year-old. The first edition of Maltin's book appeared in 1969; a second edition appeared five years later. After a third in 1978, new editions appeared every two years, and after 1986 every year. In 2005, logistical problems of a single book prompted him to launch a companion volume, Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide, restricted to films from 1960 and earlier, several of which no longer appear in the annual publication (some had been deleted over the years to make room for newer films, others removed at this point because the additional venue allowed it) and many others that never had. The latter category includes the \\"complete\\" (according to Maltin's introduction) Saturday matinee cowboy programmers of John Wayne, William \\"Hopalong Cassidy\\" Boyd, Gene Autry and Roy Rogers. The second edition of the Classic Movie Guide, published in 2010, moved the cut-off date to 1965. Besides Scheuer's Movies on TV, similar books include Halliwell's Film Guide, by Leslie Halliwell, and The Good Film and Video Guide, by David Shipman. Scheuer's guide was the first published, in 1958, preceding Maltin's by ten years, and the two were competing titles until the early 1990s. Scheuer's books had a similar format to Maltin's, except with more listings for made- for-television productions. Maltin announced in August 2014 that the 2015 edition, to be published in September 2014, would be the last: \\"An entire generation has been raised to acquire all their information online from their mobile devices or computers. These are not the likely customers for a physical paperback reference book. Our sales have sharply declined in recent years.\\" App The mobile application version of the guide was released, in 2009, to the App Store. However, the app was taken down in 2014 due to Penguin Group being unable to come to an agreement with Mobile Age, the creator of the app. References Category:Film guides Category:Book series introduced in 1969 ","title":"Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide"},{"id":"10733378","text":"North Grimston railway station was a railway station on the Malton & Driffield Railway.

It was designed by Scottish architects Gratton & McLean and it opened in 1964 and is a non-denominational, co-educational, secondary school. In 2013, North Lanarkshire Council announced amalgamation of Cumbernauld High with Abronhill High to become Cumbernauld Academy in a new building to be built on existing CHS grounds. Overview Cumbernauld Academy covers the Scottish education system's stages S1 to S6 and has the capacity for 1100 pupils. It reached about 1600 pupils in 1972 and the current roll is around 600. The school draws students from Cumbernauld and the surrounding area and includes Cumbernauld Village, Kildrum, Abronhill, Carbrain, Seafar, Castlecary, Westerwood, Dullatur, Craigmarloch, Carrickstone Vale, whitelees and Airdrie. Its associated feeder primary schools are Carbrain primary, Cumbernauld primary, Kildrum primary and Ravenswood primary. The school is situated in a large area to the south of the Kildrum Ring Road. It is bordered on the east and backs onto extensive woodland. The predominantly brick-built structure forms around the Robert Burns building which consists of three tower blocks and houses most of the classrooms. These blocks are now known as A, B and C Blocks. In the past these were referred to as Boys, Girls and Senior Blocks respectively, with each having its own dining room. The James Watt building houses the technical workshops and classrooms. The David Livingstone building houses the science labs, art and home economics classrooms. There are also extensive playing fields and indoor sports facilities, including a swimming pool. The school has a supported learning unit, which provides on-site support for pupils with special and additional learning needs. History Built in the early 1960s, it was designed to accommodate the needs of the rapidly swelling population of Cumbernauld and was a large school with places for over 1000 pupils. As the Cumbernauld Development Corporation's first secondary school, it was finished to an exceptionally high standard for the era, with teak and mahogany used widely throughout. Pupils attended from the surrounding villages including Luggiebank and Castlecary and after the closure of Twechar Primary School's Junior Secondary Department in 1966, pupils were sent to Cumbernauld High School until the new Kirkintilloch High School opened in 1972.

He is best known as the original drummer of the heavy metal band Loudness, but first rose to prominence as a member of Lazy in the 1970s. Career From a young age, he was considered a talented drummer. During his high school years, Higuchi played in seven bands. But he was not happy with this situation, wanting to focus his time on only one band. That's when schoolmate and future bandmate Akira Takasaki came along and they formed Lazy. Lazy was formed by very young musicians and started playing easy-listening pop-rock, that slowly progressed to more complex music. Higuchi was identified in the band by the moniker \\"Davy\\". When he and Takasaki shifted their musical interests to hard rock and heavy metal, they founded Loudness in 1981. During his time with Loudness, Higuchi released his first solo album, Destruction, in 1983. In the same year he produced and played drums in Mari Hamada's studio albums Lunatic Doll and Romantic Night. He left Loudness in 1992, and resumed his solo career in the late-1990s, working also on side projects, including Sly (with former Loudness' singer Minoru Niihara), Bloodcircus, Rose of Rose, and the Rock 'n' Roll Standard Club Band, besides collaborating with dozens of Japanese artists, both as producer and as drummer. In 1997, as \\"Munetaka Higuchi & Dream Castle\\", he released the album Free World. The band featured many famous musicians from the jazz and rock/metal spheres, like Steve Vai, Stanley Clarke, Billy Sheehan, Ty Tabor, Terry Bozzio, T. M. Stevens, Ronnie James Dio, Richie Kotzen, Paulinho Da Costa and others. The album was released on February 21, 1997 in Japan. In 1998, he produced Cozy Powell Forever ~ Tribute to Cozy Powell, a tribute album to the recently deceased drummer Cozy Powell, very popular in Japan. For the album, Higuchi had the collaboration of the best Japanese heavy metal musicians and was able to reunite his former bandmates of Loudness. A tour in support of the album was made with musicians from Loudness and Sly. He returned to Loudness in 2000, maintaining his high profile in the metal genre. On April 14, 2008, just two months after Loudness released the album, Metal Mad, it was announced that he was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of liver cancer. On November 30, 2008, Munetaka died at the age of 49 in a hospital in Osaka, Japan. His death had a vast echo in Japanese media and in the entertainment business. Equipment Higuchi endorsed Pearl Drums, Sabian Cymbals, Remo drumheads and Vic Firth drumsticks.

Dialect: Ùpelè) is a town in Owo Local Government in Ondo State, South-Western Nigeria.  History  The modern Ipele community is a conglomeration of eight ancient ethnic groups, all but with the exception of Ishire, who came from Ile-ife, are of Benin extraction, namely: Oko, Okeriwo, Igemoh, Ilana, Ujan, Usolo, Isire [ the only migrants from Ife ] and Ofi. Three prominent founders of Ipele were royal princes of Benin. The first two princes, Aja and Ijale were siblings and founded Okeriwo Quarters. They were the sons of Oba Ezigie of Benin. Prince Oluehin, the founder of ancient Oko village (now Oko Quarters) was according to oral history the first son of Oba Ohoan of Benin.Isacc B. Agbaje, Ipele Biographic Writers Vanguard (1996), Ipele Community Today Oko was the first Quarter to be founded on the present site being occupied by the modern Ipele town around 1640 A.D. However, Ofi Quarter which is the oldest of the eight ancient settlements but the last to join the modern Ipele town emerged in 1635 A.D.Ipele Biographic Writers Vanguard (1987), Ipele Community Who's Who In the last century and a half, new villages which started mostly as farm settlements have sprung up to add to Ipele’s population and growth. Among these new villages and settlements are Omolege, Ajagbale, Oloko, Uwese, Okeogun, Ugbojeu, Oyoroyoro, Ago Alao, Ago Mila, Ago Aderinola and Ita Ipele.  Geography  Ipele is located in the tropical rainforest. Ipele is directly 93 km east of Ondo town, 90 km north of Benin City and 65 km west of Auchi. By road, Ipele is about 15 km from Owo and 60 km from the Ondo State capital, Akure. Elevations in the town ranges from about 285 m to 305 m above sea level.  Economy  The main occupation of the Ipele people is farming. Cash crops such as cocoa, orange and kolanut are cultivated by a large number of farmers. The Ipele community also cultivates crops such as yam, cassava, cocoyam, tomatoes, pepper and corn in abundance. Education St. John's Anglican Primary School, Ipele (June 2010) Ipele currently has no post-secondary schools. The following schools are located in Ipele: ;Primary Schools * Saint John's Anglican Primary School * Saint Stephens Primary School * Saint Pauls Catholic Nursery and Primary School * Ansarudeen Primary School * New Church Primary School ;Secondary Schools * Community High School * Diocesan Secondary School  Religion  Majority of Ipele people are Christians. There are quite a few Muslims as well. Before the advent of Christianity in Ipele, the indigenes worshipped several gods one of which was Obalufon, a deified Oni of Ife. Obalufon was regarded as a higher god just below Oghodua (Olodumare) the Almighty. In 1894, Christianity was introduced to Ipele by Ghanaian rubber tappers who worked as migrant workers in the extensive rubber plantations around the town. They worked alongside indigenous workers and were able to introduce this Christianity to their indigenous colleagues. One of such colleagues was late Chief Israel Aiyejimiwo the first Baba-Egbe of the Church in Ipele and the architect of Ipele evangelism. In December 1906, the Iyeyeriye episode occurred, arising out of the Christmas sermon preached by one John Ige who came from Lagos to strengthen new Christian converts in Ipele. During the sermon, he sang a song on the birth of Christ with the chorus Iyeyeriye Omolorun wa de o (Quite fittingly the Son of God arrives). This refrain later became very popular with all the converts in Owo District and so marked the beginning of a new era for Christians in the district. In June 1907, the first batch of twelve Ipele Christians were baptized by Bishop Johnson from Lagos.  The Ero Festival  Ipele and the people of Ipele are rich in colourful various festivals but the most important one being the seven-yearly Ero festival which is mainly aimed at celebrating old age and thanksgiving for living a worthy and pious life (Sexagenarians and septuagenarians are believed to be in this group). Traditionally, Ipele is a community that can boast of a very rich traditional heritage and culture. A few of the festivals usually observed and celebrated by the people of Ipele are: ABALIFON (OBAOLUFON): Obaolufon was an Ooni of Ife at one time. He performed brilliantly during his regime that when he died the people made him a god and worshipped him by many Yorubas and was brought to Ipele from Ikole-Ekiti in a spiritual form when there was a tumult in the town during a New Yam Festival. He pacified the town and since then the people has made it an annual event to be worshipping Obaolufon just before the New Year Festival. Obaolufon came to Ipele with Orele as its messenger. The significance of the celebration annually is to appease the spirit of “Olifan” who is generally regarded as the community’s spiritual peace-maker and protector. Human beings were in the past sacrificed until it was systematically changed to dogs as a result of civilization. Three important priests usually take part in the sacrificial rite. They are the Aworo (Oloruko) – Chief Priest, from Igemo Quarter will leads the team to the Olifon shrine, Oporogho from Okeriwo Quarter will hit the dogs with a traditional staff called Esije to stupefy the dogs and Aro from Okelofi Quarter will offer the dogs as sacrifice to the Abalifon. :Ero Festival: This is the most celebrated and significant of all festivals in Ipele. It comes up once in every six (6) years, traditionally counted seven (7) years. It is an occasion for the graduation of the most senior of the seven age groups – (Olori Ugbama) and it is also an occasion for the initiation of new members to fill the vacant groups. Ipele and the people of Ipele are rich in colourful various festivals but the most important one being the seven yearly Ero Festival which is mainly aimed at celebrating old age and thanks giving for living a worthy and pious life (Sexagenarians and septuagenarians are believed to be in this group). Ero Festival is one of the most colourful festivals in Ondo state celebrated every seven years. Any native who by ascension in the age group system, gets to the seventh age group will after the next six years become an Ero graduate. The day when all the graduates are marking their graduation from the youthful and semi-adult ages to full adult age is the day usually marked for the main celebration, and which is called Ero. After this festival, they (the Ero graduates) become community elders and will no longer be required to participate in the communal manual work. They can, however, render assistance on advisory capacities voluntarily. Other related activities performed during the three months period of Ero Festival are: :OKO ERINMI: This signals the arrival of Ero Festival and it is the fore-runner of Ogwo. There are usually two Oko-Erinmi, one from Okeriwo age group while the other one comes from Odogun age group. These people are chosen from among the newly initiated Ogwo age group (Oketa Ugbama). These two chosen people customarily dressed in masquerade attires and usually have their bodies painted with charcoal powder. They hold two unsharpened knives while dancing around the town. :OGWO: This is another interesting event which precedes Ero festival. It requires jogging/dancing of the newly initiated Oketa-Ugbama members round the town. The men wear trousers (Kembe) without upper clothes while the women put on cover clothes, all white. The women will merely be following their male counterparts who are dancing. The physical fitness of the body is practically demonstrated. The jogging/dancing parade is done three times. The first one is known as Ogwo Apanon (preliminary), the second one is called Ogwo Apagwade (first main outing) and the third and final one is called Ogwo Apajoruko (the taking of appellation). Ogwo ceremony normally begins in May of the year of Ero Festival. :IRE OMAKO: This involves dancing around the town with the beating of the ground with sticks by the Oko People. It is basically for the coming together of Oko Quarter and for celebration. Ire Oma-Oko is an event which takes place every six years usually during Ero Festival and it is an event that precedes Omidanmi. OMIDANMI: This activity is carried out by those who are to be initiated into the second Age Group (Okeji Ugbama). It is the initiation of those previously in Oketa-Ugbama into Okeji Ugbama Group. Omidanmi is a deity in Okeila Quarter. Carrying out of this deity is done by a renounced thief among the group. It serves as punishment for his immorality. All the newly initiated members of this group will crowd round the Omodanmi to make it invisible to the onlookers. It is forbidden for anyone who is not an Okeila lineage or the initiated group from seeing the Omidanmi and anyone who defies this instruction and sees it will have his tongue bulged out. This is the reason why Omidanmi is strictly hidden and people who venture to see it are always caned for their own interest. :OLOPA IJA: These are sticks tied with Oja (head tie) and cowries. The graduates of the 7th age grade (Olori Ugbama) usually carry these Olopaijas out for nine consecutive days prior to Ero festival. The two (2) Olotus (leaders of Okeriwo and Odogun) used to be the first to carry their own Olopaijas out followed by other members of that group. Some people might be limited there to three days while some people will complete the nine mandatory days depending on financial capabilities. The carrying of Olopaija out is an interesting event; the occasion requires dancing to a very melodious traditional music “Gbegbekutu” and indeed an opportunity for young men and women to demonstrate their physical fitness for half-legged wrestling at the roundabout. Also, it is an occasion for feasting and well wishers attend from all walks of life. :IJE ERO: This is the 7th day after Ero Festival; it is an event to commemorate the festival. After this Ije, Oko Ero follows. This is usually on the seventeenth day after Ero proper. It is the going to the farm of each Ero celebrant to ascertain what the graduate left behind since the Ero festival activities started. The graduate usually escorted to his farm by members of his family and well wishers. This is to show how wealthy and energetic the graduate is and everyone on that entourage will carry whatever pleased them from his farm free of charge. Ero festival is the most colourful traditional festival of Ipele Community; the celebration embraces every citizen of the town irrespective of sex, age, religion and belief. Its basic significance is to promote unity, peace, social cohesion and love among the indigenes of Ipele community.

If a device's ESN or IMEI number is listed on a CEIR, it is not supposed to work on member service providers' networks; only paying members may access the database. There are a number of features which are added to the CEIR like providing statistics on the number of handset types. Growth/decline per network can be reported on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly base. Also we can see MSISDN, IMSI used by the IMEI and search for which all IMEI was used with IMSI. A common usage of a CEIR is with stolen mobile devices. Once a user reports to their operator about the theft, the mobile device's IMEI number should be entered into the CEIR, supposedly making the device unusable in any network (although this does not always work). A key reason this sometimes does not work, is that while many operators from many countries contribute IMEIs to the CEIR, each also having a unique profile that determines which operators' blocks will be included on the CEIR updates received by each operator. The UK networks for example, do not receive those block records originated by non-UK networks. Annual fees are required for access to the CEIR, and access is tightly regulated Contributing operators decide for themselves which handsets they will block from their own networks, and many network operators simply do not participate at all. Blocking users, means losing revenue. For operators it is often a trade off between business ethics and revenue. If one other operator in a country does not block the use of stolen handsets, revenue flows to that operator instead of the other, more ethical ones. Currently, the Central Equipment Identity Register is more frequently called an IMEI DB (database) system which means that it is a central system for network operators (those that have an EIR) to share their individual blacklists with one another so that service is denied for the particular devices that appear on that blacklist. The idea is for network operators to compile one global blacklist through the IMEI DB. However, there is no agreement on a single CEIR. EIR An equipment identity register reduces the threats of theft of mobile devices by enabling individual operators to prevent the use of stolen mobile devices on their own networks. This improves users' security by switching off stolen mobile devices, making them useless (bricked) for mobile devices thieves and thus less likely to be stolen in the first place. As the number of mobile devices and messaging users continue to grow, they become a target for fraudulent and criminal activities. Mobile Messaging application and infrastructure companies such as Comviva, Nokia, Mavenir, BroadForward, Primal Technologies, Svyazcom and Tekelec are examples of providers for Equipment Identity for worldwide mobile operators like Vodafone (Airwide), MTS (Svyazcom), 4GTSS and Cegetel (Tekelec) that deploy the lists for the CEIRs. There is a TRA mandatory rule to use CEIR in the operator network to prevent the handset theft and cloning of dual SIM cards.

The station was also near the deserted medieval village of Wharram Percy and adjacent to Wharram chalk quarry.* The single platform station had a passing loop off its southern end, the only one on the line. It had the customary goods facilities for wayside stations, plus a siding into Wharram Quarry, dominated by a large chalk silo. The line was originally conceived as part of a trunk route between Kingston-upon-Hull and the North East of England, but this came to very little. The station remained throughout its life as a country station on a country byway. In some periods of its life four passenger trains a day ran in each direction between and , calling at all stations between, but for the most part just three called, with no Sunday service after the outbreak of the First World War. These trains were nicknamed the \\"Malton Dodger\\". They usually had either one or two coaches, often strengthened by one or more horse boxes in this racing country. Before the Second World War, intermittent excursion traffic called at Wharram to view the station's floral displays and well as the area's scenery. In the summer of 1950, the station witnessed the passing of a Summer Saturday Filey to Newcastle train and return, which travelled via , Wharram and , joining the East Coast Main Line at Pilmoor Junction. The station and line closed to passenger traffic in June 1950. Although it was said to be reasonably loaded on Saturdays (Market Days), it carried few people except schoolchildren otherwise. The line and station were reopened to passengers in February 1953 and February 1958 when the area's roads were impassable due to snow. Freight traffic and occasional passenger specials continued until the line closed completely on 20 October 1958, the last pickup goods having called on the 18th. The quarry had \\"followed a similar pattern to North Grimston - rapid expansion in the post-First World War boom, enormous output in the 1920s, declining in the 1930s and fizzling out after the Second World war.\\" In 1919 a private siding was built in the quarry with exits in both directions onto the running line. Traffic growth was dramatic, peaking in 1925 with 107,261 tons of chalk forwarded to Thirsk, bypassing Malton as the line had originally been conceived. This was down to 38,562 tons in 1926 and to a mere 3,000 tons in 1929. The quarry closed in 1930. It reopened later in the 1930s, but its output was sporadic and small scale, mainly travelling by road in bags. Such rail traffic as there mainly coal for the quarry's kilns. The quarry was disused by 1960 and has become a wildlife reserve. The track was lifted shortly after closure, but the station building remained in use as a private residence.

It is 99 km from Bogotá. It is characterized as an agricultural pantry area due to the high fertility of the land and variety of climates. San Bernardo's main products are blackberry and pea, renowned for its excellent quality. Due to its location on the Andes the weather conditions are ruled by the altitude and by the wind from the Páramo Sumapaz; this affects the temperature cooling some areas of the municipality, especially at night, and providing mild weather in some other high altitude areas.  History  San Bernardo was born from a vast amount of mountain terrain colonized to 1910 on July 22 in the morning when Father Mazo celebrated Mass and said the town was founded in honor of Archbishop of Bogotá Bernardo Herrera Restrepo; it was blessed that day. The bells of chapel were donated by General Charles J. Heredia. In January 1913, the first party enlivened by the band Espinal. The municipality of Pandi in 1914 it stood at corregimiento. By Ordinance No. 66, April 30, 1920 emerged as the municipality, the municipality of Pandi segregated, plus the district of Nazareth, was sentenced by the Governor Eduardo Restrepo Saenz and regulated by Decree 289 of June 23, 1921. The first mayor was Miguel Mena. The tribunal ruling by June 30 of 1923 declared null and that the ordinance under the Gobernandor Eduardo Briceño by Decree 1254 of August 14, 1923 abolished the town reintegrating Pandi and Bogota. For Ordennaza No. 62, May 3, 1927 was definitely the municipality and the mayor was Malo Daniel O Leary. The parish was established by decree of January 29, 1932 Archbishop Ismael Perdomo.  Tourism  The great natural landscapes are accompanied by agricultural pictorial scenes, water flows and springs as well. It is recognized for the great variety of native vegetation, flowers and birds.  Mummies  Increasingly travelers are visiting the natural mummies of San Bernardo housed in a mausoleum in the local cemetery. Hundreds of mummies have been discovered here since the town relocated the cemetery in the mid-1950s after the previous cemetery suffered a flood. It is unclear what is causing bodies buried here to mummify, though many locals say it is because of a diet rich in a local fruit, the chayote, known locally as the guatila. However, because the clothes were also preserved, the cause of mummification is more likely due to the climate and/or the altitude of the town. There are approximately 14 mummies on display in the mausoleum, many preserved almost completely with skin, hair and even the clothes they were buried in. Groundskeepers insist the bodies are not embalmed or treated in any way before being buried. The cause is the micro climate in the tombs, and the fact that the buried bodies wear clothes that protect from fly larvas inside the tombs. The only insects that enter the tombs are from burial flowers, and flies enter on those. The bodies are buried with clothes, which protect the bodies from the larvas, the dry micro climate in the tomb then dries out the bodies. The bodies have arched backs, which is typical of mummies from dry climate, according to forensic specialist in the documentary Udda platser i Världen (2018), season 1, episode 9 of 20. = Events and places = * Fairs and festivals are held at the end of June and early July; they have great appreciation for quality and organization. * Principal church * Historic roads. * Cemetery * The mausoleum of the Natural Mummies: Well-preserved mummies are at this place.

Context With over 500,000 children and over 1,500 schools, Puerto Rico's public education system is the third largest in the United States. It also ranks at the very bottom on all indicators of academic achievement in comparison to other states and U.S. territories. Over half of its schools are not making Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) under the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law. The 2008 island-wide standardized academic performance tests show that 45% of students are not proficient in Spanish, 40% are not proficient in English and 45% are not proficient in math. 91% of fourth grade students in Puerto Rico scored below grade level in math in comparison to their peers according to the 2004 National Assessment of Educational Progress. Purpose Sapientis' purpose is to mobilize an island- wide network of diverse and informed change agents who exercise leadership to improve the quality of public schools for all Puerto Rican children. Strategy Sapientis believes that to successfully improve schools, all sectors of society must connect and engage, and not rest until every child in Puerto Rico has access to a quality public education system that develops students' abilities, nurtures their talents and prepares them to compete internationally. The organization also believes that when concerned citizens come together with specific ideas about improving schools, positive change can become a reality. An analogous process is the Civil Rights Movement in the American South in the 1960s. Pressure for change and acts of leadership came from all sectors: formal authority (President Lyndon B. Johnson, Congress, the Courts), the media, from persons of authority within the black community (Martin Luther King Jr.), the general white and black populations, governors who forced schools to integrate and more. Adaptive Leadership The organization, created by two graduates of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government– Kristin Ehrgood and Vadim Nikitine – designs and implements programs built on a leadership model developed by renowned leadership professor Dr. Ronald Heifetz. The model incorporates elements of disciplines as diverse as philosophy, biology, political science, administration, social psychology and music. It has been developed over 20 years and has been implemented in approximately 85 countries around the globe. Contrary to leadership models that focus on traits or characteristics of a traditional \\"leader\\" the adaptive leadership model views leadership as an action, not a person. Any individual, with or without formal authority can exercise leadership by observing, interpreting and intervening within a group or organization. Exercising leadership is a recurring activity that forces the organization or group to face its most critical challenges and mobilize its resources in order to generate progress. Sapientis' goal over the next three years is to use this model as an essential tool to fulfill its purpose as an organization. The name Sapientis comes from Latin and means common sense, knowledge, and wisdom. Thus, the name embodies the organization's core values. Programs Through its programs, Sapientis intends to spur change at the local level and help recruit individuals from different sectors into the network: Schools on the Move Over three years, Sapientis has worked with a cluster of seven schools to ensure that members of the schools' Improvement Teams (teachers, principals, parents, community members and non-teaching staff) exercise leadership to improve student achievement and their learning environments. It builds a team in each school to help it diagnose root problems, create and implement a series of interventions, evaluate progress and continue the improvement cycle. This program is being implemented in the Luis Llorens Torres public housing complex, home to over 40,000 residents in the heart of San Juan. Youth Leadership Sapientis recruits and trains middle and high school students in the adaptive leadership model. It also provides follow-up support to ensure student participation in their schools' Improvement Teams. Sapientis provides financial support via small grants to support leadership efforts and assist seniors in their higher education goals. Frontline Educators Sapientis works with teachers and school directors through a fellowship program that provides participants with a deeper understanding of the adaptive leadership model. This model is presented as a useful tool for diagnosing challenges and generating progress in student achievement and the school environment. Get Involved Sapientis engages concerned individuals and socially responsible corporations as supporters of its efforts to improve the quality of Puerto Rico's public education. The program provides information about Puerto Rico's public education system, Sapientis, and the adaptive leadership model, as well as opportunities to visit public schools. To raise the public's awareness of the education system, the \\"Get Involved\\" program holds an annual event, Sapientis Week, with approximately 15 distinguished individuals volunteering their time to teach a class at a public school. Participants come from the public, private, and non-profit sectors and join Sapientis in bringing attention to challenges faced by public schools as well as to the important role that teachers play in society. Sapientis also offers ADAPTA, a leadership seminar for private companies, non-profit organizations and other groups. ADAPTA attempts to unleash Sapientis' theory of change in other spheres and fosters a better understanding of the adaptive leadership model. Goals By 2012 Sapientis will: Mobilize over 10,000 individuals to join and participate in its network. Make the quality of public education one of the top three priorities in Puerto Rico. Measure and disseminate the results of its programs and leadership efforts. Guarantee stability and financial diversity. Sustain efficiency and effectiveness as an organization. Highlights of Sapientis' work Since 2002, Sapientis has raised more than $5 million from corporations, foundations, and individuals in Puerto Rico and in the US. In December 2006, Sapientis and the Puerto Rico Department of Education signed an agreement that allows Sapientis to develop leadership programs to improve students' achievement in the island's most under-performing public schools. To date, Sapientis has trained nearly 500 teachers, principals and education community members.

The town of San Francisco has about one-third the population of the municipality, with the rest living in the rural districts of Arrayán, El Peñón, Juan de Vera, La Laja, Muña, Pueblo Viejo, Sabaneta, San Antonio, San Miguel, and Tóriba. The municipality is within temperate and cold climatic zones, and has a geomorphology of moorland (páramo bajo). The municipality has an average temperature of in most of the territory, with an average annual rainfall of . It is located away from Bogotá; this distance, with its climate, scenery, water resources and other features make it attractive for tourism. San Francisco is in the Diocese of Facatativá.http://www.diocesisfacatativa.org/31-diocesis-de- facatativa/parroquias-men History The area was inhabited by the Panches, part of the Carib family, and Muisca, part of the Chibcha family. The Muisca lived in the southeastern part of the current municipality where it borders the municipality of El Rosal, where they established a fort to prevent access of the Panche Nation to the Confederation of Bacatá, whose sovereign was the Zipa and was located in the Sabana de Bogota. In the colonial period, because the foundation of the municipality of Tenjo, six encomiendas were created, to which the indigenous people of that area were assigned. One of the encomiendas in the vicinity of Subachoque, was assigned to the Spanish citizen Don Juan de Vera, who named his property \\"Chinga Fría\\"; in Mexican Spanish chinga means \\"fuck\\", and in the Chibcha language means \\"wildness\\" or \\"bravery\\". Then, between 1605 and when the neighboring town of La Vega was founded, Don Juan de Vera exchanged his encomienda \\"Chinga Fría\\" for another property. This new encomienda was named San José de Chinga Caliente; San José to give it a Christian name, and hot to distinguish it from the previous one in a colder area. Later, around 1750, these lands were acquired by Pedro Pulido, from the municipality of Tenjo. In 1828, Francisca Sánchez, from Tabio, bought the hacienda San José de Chinga Caliente from Pulido. Francisca Sánchez married the French citizen Francisco Convers in 1833. After 1850, the couple built the house that would later be called La Carlina, because the mansion of the encomienda was extremely run down. At the time, the population of the region was about eight hundred thousand. The exploitation of virgin forests rewarded their efforts and gave some a comfortable existence. The growing population of the region felt the need to create an urban center to consolidate the civil authorities to solve the issues caused by the great travel distance to La Vega. In 1855 Father Santos Maria Camero was appointed parish priest of La Vega. Days after his inauguration, he was invited to Chinga Caliente to provide the last rites to a dying man. Coming from La Vega, as he came over the pass, he was delighted with the beautiful plain that opened before his eyes. He was briefed about the feelings of the people of the area, then he asked Francisca Sanchez de Convers to donate a property to the Church where he wanted to build a village to serve as the center to a parish. She agreed. By 1856, Father Santos directed the subdivision of 41 lots on the bridle path leading to the mountains of Yaque, where 20 thatched houses were built with clay tile and dirt floors. On January 29, 1857, a commission headed by Pío Molano, the priest of Funza, and the mayor of La Vega, came to this village with the aim of studying elevating the village to a municipality. The commission met Francisco Convers and Francisca Sanchez, and other notables of the village. The coincidence of this being the date on which the Church celebrates the feast of St. Francis de Sales, the owners of the land being named Francisca and Francisco was much discussed and celebrated by those present, who agreed that the community would be called San Francisco de Sales and the parish would have the saint as its patron saint. On receiving the report, the Archbishop of Bogota created the parish by episcopal decree on August 15, 1857; naming Father Santos Maria Camero as pastor. The priest, advised by his parishioners, presented a draft constitution for a new municipality to the Assembly of the State of Cundinamarca. The Cundinamarca State Assembly discussed the draft and on November 21, 1857, approved it, erecting a new municipality in the Department of Zipaquira, between the municipalities of Subachoque and La Vega, called San Francisco, and ordered expanding the land of the village to nine hectares. The Assembly also ordered the construction of public offices and jail, in order to appoint civil authorities. Political persecution due to the civil war that erupted in 1859, made the Lady Frances sell the hacienda to Dr. Senen Gutiérrez Castillo of San Juan de Rioseco, who, on February 2, 1873, delivered the nine hectares ordered by the Assembly of Cundinamarca in 1857 to Fray Blas Lombana. In 1884, the first \\"mixed\\" school was founded. In 1895, Mayor Rogelio Alvarado and the priest Florentino Sarmiento established a Post & Telegraph office. In the early twentieth century, the Hacienda San Jose de Chinga Caliente passed into the hands of Ricardo Jaramillo and his wife Carlina, who changed the name of the estate to Hacienda La Carlina. This farm was later acquired by Dr. Samuel Hoyos Arango, a native of Caldas. In 1928 the first power plant, owned by Don Jose de la Cruz Florez was established in the Quinta de San Luis, three kilometers northwest of town. Various problems shut down the first power plant and the population was deprived of service for several years until 1948 the Jorge Escallón and Jacobo Flórez inaugurated a new plant on the right bank of the San Miguel River, adjoining the bridge of the road leading to Supatá. The current parish church and the rectory were built between 1943 and 1953, while Father José Arquímedes Castro was the town priest. In 1935, Eduardo and Hernando Luque, sons of General Silvestre Luque, founded the first boys' school, which soon became the parish school, and was eventually named \\"Colegio Divino Niño\\". In mid-1935, Father Joaquín Luna Serrano founded the Farm School for Poor Children. In 1943, Esther Melo and her daughter Anita founded the first girl's school, \\"El Perpetuo Socorro\\". It was also renamed \\"Colegio Divino Niño\\". In 1965 Father Francisco Jimenez, transferred the parish schools to the Department of Cundinamarca. The girls' and boys' schools were united and renamed \\"Colegio Departamental Integrado Divino Niño\\" (Divine Child Integrated Departmental School).

Schirripa as Bobby Baccalieri * Frank Vincent as Phil Leotardo * = credit only =Guest starring= * Jerry Adler as Hesh Rabkin Also guest starring Synopsis The FBI recovers the body of bookie Willie Overall based on information from Soprano crime family capo \\"Larry Boy\\" Barese. Overall was the first person murdered by Tony, in 1982. Tony and Paulie drive to Miami to wait until the heat is off. On the way down, Tony asks Paulie how Johnny heard about Ralphie's joke about his wife, but Paulie says he does not know. This incident nearly led to hostilities between the Soprano and Lupertazzi families. Paulie was Tony's role model while growing up, but Tony tells Beansie Gaeta that Paulie may be a liability—he talks too much and Tony wonders whether his loyalty has ever been truly \\"put to the test.\\" In Miami, the two men meet Beansie's Cuban contacts and agree to trade in stolen goods. Larry tells the FBI that the late Jackie Aprile, Sr. killed Overall. Tony rents a sport fishing boat to celebrate with Paulie. Paulie becomes uneasy as he remembers Pussy's murder on a boat. On the boat Tony questions Paulie again about the joke leak; Paulie again denies involvement. Tony glances at a hatchet and some fishing knives. That night, Paulie has a dream in which he asks Pussy, \\"When my time comes, will I stand up?\\" When they return to New Jersey Paulie sends Tony and Carmela a $2,000 espresso machine. When she wonders why, Tony says that they owe their lifestyle to the hard work of people like Paulie. While in Miami, Tony arranges a short-term loan of $200,000 from Hesh to cover a string of losing sports bets. In New York City, Faustino \\"Doc\\" Santoro and his bodyguard are murdered in a hit arranged by Phil, who becomes the new boss of the Lupertazzi family. Junior is visited at his mental care center by his former soldiers Pat Blundetto and Beppy Scerbo and begs them to aid his escape, but soon loses his resolve; \\"Where would I lam it to?\\" he asks. He returns to his old mob habits, bribing an orderly and organizing an illicit poker game for other patients. Professor Lynch, a patient Junior teases, informs on him and the game is ended. Junior finds an admiring follower in a young patient named Carter Chong, who has been institutionalized for his anger issues. Junior assaults Professor Lynch and is given a new regimen of sedatives. Carter devises a plan to distract the orderlies handing the pills to Junior so that he can covertly throw them away. Some of the drugs were meant to combat Junior's incontinence, and he soon humiliatingly wets himself. The orderly is fired for taking bribes and Junior is threatened with a transfer to a less pleasant, state-run mental facility if he does not take his medications. He complies with the treatment, much to Carter's disillusionment. Junior tries to make up with him, but calls him \\"Anthony.\\" At a piano recital, Carter starts throwing paper balls at the pianist; when Junior shows disapproval, Carter becomes enraged and ferociously attacks him. The episode ends with the patients (not including Carter) receiving animal-assisted therapy in the garden. Junior is in a wheelchair, with one arm in a cast, seated apart from the others, petting a cat. Deceased * Willie Overall: A bookie shot dead by Tony Soprano with a revolver on orders from \\"Johnny Boy\\" Soprano. Tony's very first murder at the age of 22. (A flashback from 1982) * Faustino \\"Doc\\" Santoro: killed after leaving a massage parlor in New York City by multiple gunshots from a trio of gunmen on orders from Phil Leotardo to take over his Lupertazzi crime family boss's title and/or as a revenge for the Gerry Torciano murder and/or as payback for his insults done to Phil. * Unnamed Bodyguard: killed alongside \\"Doc\\" Santoro. Title reference * Tony angrily describes \\"Remember when...\\" reminiscing as the lowest form of conversation. * Many stories from the past are told in this episode, particularly from Paulie, most of them beginning with the phrase \\"Remember when...?\\" * Junior briefly gets a taste of his old life while running his card game in the hospital. * Could also refer to Junior's advancing stages of dementia and his increasing memory loss. * A recurrent motif is Tony reminiscing about the disclosure of Ralph's insensitive joke to Johnny Sack. Production * \\"Remember When\\" was the career directorial debut of Phil Abraham, a longtime Sopranos cinematographer ever since the first season of the show. Abraham initially started only as a camera operator for the TV series. * Lin-Manuel Miranda, writer and future star of Hamilton and In the Heights, makes a brief appearance in this episode as the bellman with whom Tony and Paulie briefly converse from the car. Connections to prior episodes * Paulie remembers the time Ralphie was obsessed with Gladiator and hit Georgie with a chain, which happened in the Season 3 episode \\"University\\". * Tony repeatedly asks Paulie if he told Johnny Sack about the off-color joke that Ralph told about a mole on Ginny \\"Sack\\"'s posterior (in the episode \\"No Show\\"). Paulie denies this (Paulie actually did tell it to Johnny Sack, in the episode \\"Christopher\\"). * Tony checks into a hotel in Miami using the fake surname “Spears.” This is the same name Tony uses when consulting a new psychiatrist in \\"Guy Walks Into a Psychiatrist’s Office...\\". * Beansie is a paraplegic and has to void in a bag due to the injuries he sustained when Richie Aprile ran over him in the Season 2 episode \\"Toodle Fucking-Oo\\". * Tony recalls finding a painting of himself as a general at Paulie's house, which occurred in the Season 5 finale \\"All Due Respect\\". * When Paulie boards a boat with Tony, this episode uses flashback scenes from the murder of Big Pussy on a boat, taken from the Season 2 finale \\"Funhouse\\". Other cultural and historical references * During the times Junior is in his room, he watches television. Shows that he watched in this episode included a Weather Channel documentary hosted by Jim Cantore, and The $25,000 Pyramid. * When driving through Maryland near Washington, DC, Paulie asks, \\"Chevy Chase, whatever happened to him?\\" Paulie means the actor Chevy Chase but is actually looking at a road sign for the town Chevy Chase. * Paulie mentions an incident when, after being pulled over, Tony's father tricked him into insulting a cop by saying his cousin was \\"on the job\\" and his name was Barney Fife. * In his letter to Dick Cheney, Junior refers to the then-Vice President's 2006 hunting incident as an example of a gun discharge accident, which, Junior claims, is similar to his own \\"accidental\\" shooting of Tony Soprano. * Junior's orderly Jameel sells his autographed photos on eBay. * Tony, complaining about what a big mouth Paulie is, mutters \\"Gary Cooper,\\" a reference to an actor known as \\"The Strong, Silent Type\\". * When Tony hears Paulie laughing loudly, he leans over his balcony and sees Paulie sitting on his bed, watching the '70s sitcom Three's Company. * As a diversion for Junior to covertly not take his drugs, Carter screams: \\"Where is my iPod?\\" * The closing scene, which depicts Uncle Junior sitting on an outdoor chair, lost in thought, as the screen slowly fades to black, is possibly a nod to the closing scene of The Godfather Part II, which shows Al Pacino as Michael Corleone in a similar pose. Michael Corleone's father Vito Corleone was memorably depicted stroking a cat in The Godfather. * Tony's tomato plants in his yard are reminiscent of the ones Vito Corleone had in his garden in The Godfather. * The hit on Doc Santoro resembles the assassination of Paul Castellano. * When Tony calls Hesh from Florida to ask for a loan, Hesh is sitting in Katz's Delicatessen. Music * The song playing on the radio as Tony and Paulie travel through the Fredericksburg, Virginia area (according to the station identification for WWUZ heard in this scene) was \\"Rock On\\", by David Essex. * The instrumental piece played in the bar during Tony and Paulie's stop in Virginia is an instrumental version of \\"I Just Wanna Stop\\" by Gino Vannelli. *The piano piece playing in the hotel canteen, when Tony tells Paulie off, is the theme for the movie Terms of Endearment, composed by Michael Gore. * The song Junior sings with the other patients is \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\", a song made famous in 1971 by John Denver. * The instrumental piece played over the end credits is \\"Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing)\\" by the Benny Goodman Orchestra.

It lies in mountainous terrain in the coffee land at an altitude of about 4,000 feet, high above the Magdalena River, on the western slope of Colombia's eastern cordillera about 60 miles from Bogotá by car. On a clear day the snow-capped peaks of four volcanos in the central cordillera (Nevado del Tolima, Nevado del Quindío, Nevado de Santa Isabel, and Nevado del Ruiz) can be seen in the distance to the west. The main industry of the region is agriculture, principally coffee grown in small farms on steep slopes in the shade provided by banana trees, guava trees, cacao trees, papaya trees, and other tropical trees, the fruit from which provides an additional income crop for farmers. Higuerilla, the seeds of which yield a fine oil, is another cash crop. Coffee in the San Juan area is still grown and processed in traditional ways, and at some times of the year, coffee is spread out to dry on sunny days in a small plaza located northeast of the central plaza. Daytime temperatures, year- round, commonly range in the 70s and 80s (degrees Fahrenheit), dropping into the 60s at night. A lovely, light fog often drifts through the air in early morning. Heavy rainstorms are common, but usually of short duration. The town is busy by day, and the central plaza, dominated by a twin-towered Catholic church on the west side, provides a gathering place for the local population in the evenings, when street-vendors sell delicious arepas and chorizos, and cafés with outdoor seating serve soft drinks and beer. The Rapicono (nearby but off plaza) is a popular spot for an ice cream desert or a traditional, Colombian fruit cocktail called salpicón. San Juan and the surrounding area have an amazing variety of beautiful birds of all colors: blues, reds, yellows, greens, browns, and blacks. Many friendly dogs socialize throughout the town during the day and return home to their human families in the early evening. Local roosters coax their hens to their roosts at 6:00 pm every day and wake the town in the early morning with their quiquiriquís to start another day in the coffee land. The families of some prominent politicians and farmers of Colombia have come from San Juan de Ricoseco. One of them is the maternal family of former President Julio César Turbay Ayala. Another is the family of Lucila López Poveda de García, the first woman elected to the Asamblea of the Department of Tolima, and her uncle Roberto Poveda Ramírez, a coffee farmer legendary in the region who had a large plantation at La Muchagua, about four miles by car west of San Juan. Also from San Juan were the family of Doctor Eduardo Millan Millan (Magistrado de la Corte Suprema de Justicia, the Supreme Court of Colombia), Ingeniero Alfonso Santos Montero (Senador de la República and Rector of both Universidad de Cundinamarca and Universidad Libre), and Álvaro Cruz Vargas (twice governor of Cundinamarca, stripped of his office for embezzlement).

After brushing off Frank Burns' (Larry Linville) suggestions he had been involved in a fight, Weston confides to Hawkeye (Alan Alda) that he had been beaten up by soldiers from his unit after he got drunk and inadvertently admitted to being a homosexual. Back in their quarters, Hawkeye and Trapper (Wayne Rogers) discuss the beatings and Frank admits he finds Weston's sexuality \\"disgusting\\", in contrast to his initial admiration of Weston for being on frontline active service. Frank initiates moves to have Weston dishonorably discharged from the Army. In order to convince Frank not to proceed, Hawkeye and Trapper stage a mock argument, during which Trapper 'confesses' to having bought the answers for a medical school examination, which leads Frank to admit that he did, too. Hawkeye and Trapper admit their ruse and Frank is persuaded to drop his actions.

He designed and built groundbreaking synthesizers and studio equipment from the early 1960s onwards. Born Harald Thumann in Germany, he started out as a drummer while getting a thorough grounding in audio engineering in German broadcasting. When touring lost appeal, Thumann put his musical and technical experience to work and started his first recording studio in a bedroom at the family home. Thumann participated in the development of the SSL 4000 series of consoles, and took the first one for this studio. Premises for a permanent studio with live-in accommodation were found in Germering near Munich, and Countrylane Studios were born. Thumann later recognised the potential of MIDI, and used Commodore 64 computers with MIDI cards, controlling a system that evolved into a synthesizer installation including Fairlight II and Moog 3C modular system. This led to a string of albums for Rondò Veneziano, which married both acoustic instruments and synthesizers. Thumann released his first solo album American Express in 1979. It had the hit single \\"Underwater\\", which was later used in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV. His second solo album was Andromeda, released in 1982, contained the highly influential track Sphinx, which later inspired the theme to Knight Rider. Both albums remain out of print and only released on vinyl. American Express was given a remastered digital release on iTunes, but Andromeda remains left out. Thumann had a run of what he called \\"dog records\\", under the 'Wonder Dog' name, which received some success in Germany and the UK (through E&S; Music). The single, \\"Ruff Mix\\", peaked at #31 in the UK Singles Chart in September 1982. With the introduction of the Yamaha DMP-7 digital mixer, Thumann built a second control room housing several DMP-7s as an integrated digital console system, interfaced with a rebuilt Neve broadcast console. Countrylane moved into audio-visual production, and started producing its own telefilms.

This is a nonspecific indicator of the presence of disease.Oxford Textbook of Medicine Conversely, the presence of rouleaux is a cause of disease because it will restrict the flow of blood throughout the body because capillaries can only accept free-flowing singular and independent red blood cells. The aggregations, also known as \\"clumping,\\" form as an allergic reaction to certain antibiotics and not necessarily because of disease. Conditions that cause rouleaux formation include infections, multiple myeloma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, inflammatory and connective tissue disorders, and cancers. It also occurs in diabetes mellitus and is one of the causative factors for microvascular occlusion in diabetic retinopathy. Acute-phase proteins, particularly fibrinogen, interact with sialic acid on the surface of RBCs to facilitate the formation of rouleaux. An increase in the ratio of RBCs to plasma volume, as seen in the setting of polycythemia and hypovolemia, increases rouleaux formation and accelerates sedimentation. Rouleaux formation is retarded by albumin proteins. Rouleaux formations are also adopted by spermatozoa as a means of cooperation between genetically similar gametocytes so as to improve reproductive success through enhanced motility and, therefore, fertilization capacity—e.g., the guinea pig. Typical mammalian erythrocytes: (a) seen from surface; (b) in profile, forming rouleaux. Kinetics of Linear Rouleaux Formation According to Smoluchowski aggregation, the kinetics of colloids is based on the assumption that each particle is surrounded by a \\"sphere influence\\". Single spherical particles which undergo Brownian motion collide and sticking of particles happens. As aggregation proceeds, the average diffusion constant of the aggregate population decreases. The aggregation of red blood cells progresses in the same manner except that cells are biconcave rather than spherical.

Biography Ibrahim El- Gohary was born to poor Coptic parents in Qalyub. His father, Youssef El- Gohary, made clothes for living. As a young child, Ibrahim excelled in writing and arithmetic. When he grew up, he began to transcribe religious books and distribute them to churches at his own expense. This action drew the attention of Pope John XVIII, who met with Ibrahim and blessed him. The Pope also mediated on Ibrahim's behalf and he became the chief scribe of Master Rizk, another prominent Copt at that time. When Muhammad Abu-'l-Dhahab became ruler of Egypt, Ibrahim El-Gohary became the chief scribe of all Egypt, a position equivalent to that of a Prime Minister today. Ibrahim had one son named Youssef and one daughter named Demiana. Youssef died at a young age, shortly before his wedding. Demiana died a short time afterwards without having been married. Ibrahim El-Gohary was very loved by the Egyptians. He was also named The Sultan of the Copts for his great love and attachment to his Coptic identity. The famous historian Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti wrote about Ibrahim El-Gohary, saying: *\\"He had made Egypt great by his capability which endured for long time. He was one of the great world statesmen with a great decisive mind. He treated everyone according to their abilities, and did things that attracted the hearts and the love of the people to him.\\" Building churches Ibrahim El-Gohary was known for his love for building new churches and monasteries, and for repairing those that had been destroyed by Muslims. Due to his influential position in the government and his great favour to the Muslim rulers, he was able to issue fatwas that permitted the Copts to rebuild the destroyed churches and monasteries. This was of particular importance because the Copts were not allowed to build new churches or to repair old ones unless they got official government approval, which was rarely granted. One of these churches that he built is the Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Azbakeya in Cairo, that his brother completed and congregated by Pope Mark VIII in 1800. \\"The Departure of the most honored Layman Ibrahim El-Gohari\\" at Coptic Orthodox Church Network Ibrahim El-Gohary also donated many endowment of good land and money for the reconstruction, that amounted to 238 endowments as documented in the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate. In 1794 Ibrahim El-Gohary renovated Saint Mary Church (Haret Elroum) which was the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria at the time. Ibrahim El-Gohary remained in his position until a coup d'etat by Hasan Qubtan forced him, along with Murad Bey and Ibrahim Bey to flee to Upper Egypt. Qubtan persecuted the Copts, forbidding them to ride horses with saddles or to use Muslims as servants. Hasan Qubtan also confiscated all of El-Gohary's belongings and endowments. On 7 August 1791, Murad Bey, Ibrahim Bey and Ibrahim El-Gohary returned to Cairo and El-Gohary assumed his former position. Death Ibrahim El-Gohary died four years later, on Monday, 25 Pashons, 1511 A.M. (31 May 1795) His eulogy was made by Pope John XVIII, and his funeral was attended by Ibrahim Bey. He was buried in a private tomb that he had built for himself next to the church of Saint George in Old Cairo.

He is noted particularly for his work around Santa Barbara, California, and for popularizing the Spanish Colonial Revival style in early 20th Century America. Early life and art career George Washington Smith was born in East Liberty, Pennsylvania in 1876 (on George Washington's birthday), the son of a prominent Pennsylvania engineer. Raised in Philadelphia, he was able to study painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Later, he attended Harvard University to study architecture, but was unable to graduate due to his family's financial difficulties. He obtained employment as a draftsman in a Philadelphia architectural firm, but was unsatisfied with the lifestyle this afforded him. Smith turned to bond trading and quickly became very successful. His success in the bond markets allowed him to quit work in 1911 to devote himself to painting and the study of art. He married Mary Catherine Greenough and the couple moved to Europe. An admirer of the works of Paul Cézanne and Paul Gauguin, Smith traveled around the continent painting landscapes, as well as studying in Rome and at the Académie Julian in Paris. The Smiths spent three years in Europe, returning to the United States at the outbreak of World War I. Establishing himself in New York, Smith began exhibiting with other painters of the era, including John Sloan and George Bellows. His work gained notice and was soon being exhibited outside New York as well, at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington D.C., the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1915 Smith traveled to California, where his paintings were to be on display in the Palace of Fine Arts at San Francisco's Panama Pacific Exposition. Architectural career While in California, he visited friends from Philadelphia who had relocated to Montecito, a rustic suburb of Santa Barbara. Still intending to return to Europe at the close of the war, he decided to remain in California for the duration. He purchased land in Montecito and designed and built a home and studio. He modeled the home after farmhouses he had seen in Andalusia during a trip to Spain in 1914.Gebhard, 2005, p. 113. The house he built in 1917, called Casa Dracaena (a.k.a. El Hogar and Heberton House), was an immediate success. www.hispanic5. 'Casa Dracaena.' Images of it were used to sell cement and tiles among other goods, and Smith quickly found that his neighbors wanted to live in houses like it. Before long he stopped painting and took up working as an architect full-time in Santa Barbara. His plans to return to Europe after the war were abandoned, and he remained in the Santa Barbara area for the remainder of his life. Before his death in 1930 Smith designed some 80 homes in Santa Barbara County alone, and worked nationwide. In his time, George Washington Smith was one of the most popular architects in the United States, his homes appearing in leading architecture and interior design magazines. Smith is sometimes credited with being the \\"father\\" of the Spanish-Colonial Revival style in the United States, although he worked in other idioms as well. Despite his popularity in his era, Smith is not widely recognized today, though his homes remain popular and several are on the National Register. His original Montecito home, as well as \\"Casa del Greco\\", his second self-designed residence next door, built in 1920, exist today as family residences. Two additional Smith designs were built in Hope Ranch in the mid-1920s: Meadow Farm for Milton Wilson, now named Robledal, and Florestal, originally built for the Peter Cooper Bryce family.Gebhard, 2005, pp. 115, 118, 160–161. Legacy Smith's 21st Montecito house, Casa del Herrero (House of the Blacksmith), built for St. Louis industrialist George Steedman in 1922, is now a museum. Most of Smith's original sketches and drawings and much of his correspondence are held at the Architecture and Design Collection of the Art Museum at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The house is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house is owned by the non-profit Casa del Herrero foundation, and can be visited by appointment. Also listed on the National Register is Santa Barbara's Lobero Theater, completely rebuilt to Smith's design in 1924. =Jackling House controversy= The Daniel C. Jackling house in its prior state (photo courtesy http://www.terrastories.com/bearings) Smith's name returned to public view in the 2000s after Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs purchased a George Washington Smith home in Woodside, California.

Jobs appealed the court decision to the California State Court of Appeals, but that court agreed with the lower court ruling in 2007.

He tells Dr. Melfi that he needs the risk; she tells him that she will cease treating him if he continues to miss appointments. Hesh asks Tony about repayment of the $200,000 loan. Tony pretends to have forgotten it, then offers to pay the vig (weekly interest). Hesh was not charging Tony interest and is insulted that Tony treats the loan as a mere business transaction. Tony calls Hesh a “Shylock” in front of his crew. Later Hesh says to his son-in- law, \\"At what point is it cheaper for him to settle in another way?\\" Carmela sells the spec house with its sub-standard materials to her cousin Brian Cammarata and his pregnant wife. She tells Tony that she has cleared $600,000 and he assumes that half the profit is his. He wants to bet it on a \\"sure thing\\" but Carmela refuses and he yields to her. The \\"sure thing\\" wins but he only had $10,000 to bet on it, and this leads to a furious row about money. He manhandles her and she throws an expensive ornament at him; she misses and it shatters on the floor. Later, he apologises and they reconcile. She is worried about the many threats hanging over them. He says he survived being shot; \\"Big picture-wise, I'm up, way up.\\" Vito's widow, Marie, asks Tony for help for her son, Vito Jr., who has been wearing Goth makeup and behaving out of control following his father's murder. Marie requests $100,000 to move her family to Maine to start over. Tony is reluctant. Both he and Phil (Marie's second cousin) talk to the boy, without effect (Phil tells him he looks like \\"a Puerto Rican whore\\"). Phil is also reluctant to fund the move to Maine. Vito Jr. is expelled for defecating in the school shower, and Tony changes his mind. He decides to pay for the relocation but gambles away the $100,000 he had reserved for it. Instead he offers Marie to send Vito Jr. to a boot camp program in Idaho. He plays down her worries about corporal punishment and says he will pay the $18,000 fee. Marie reluctantly accepts and Vito Jr. is taken away against his will by the boot camp's representatives, leaving his mother and sister in tears. Driving by, Tony happens to notice Ahmed and Muhammad mingling with traditionally dressed Middle-Easterners on a street. A.J. proposes to Blanca, who accepts after some hesitation, but later breaks up with him. Renata, Hesh's girlfriend, dies suddenly. He is grief-stricken. Tony visits him and speaks clichéd words of condolence. He puts down a large paper bag: \\"I brought your money.\\" First appearance * Jason Gervasi: Son of DiMeo capo Carlo Gervasi.

Named in honor of Saint Mamas, the town overlooks the Litani River and the medieval Beaufort Castle to the west and the snow-capped summits of Mount Hermon to the east. History In 1838, Eli Smith noted Deir Mimas's population as Greek Orthodox and Catholic Christians.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 137 In 1852, Edward Robinson noted the village from Beaufort Castle.Robinson and Smith, 1856, pp. pp. 51, 373 In 1875 Victor Guérin visited; the population ascribed to Deir Mimas by Guerin was 1,000. With the exception of twenty Protestants, he says, they were all \\"Schismatic Greeks\\".Guérin, 1880, p. 278, as given in Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 86 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it as: \\"A village, built of stone, containing about 300 Christians, surrounded by large groves of olives, and gardens of figs, pomegranates, and vineyards, with arable land to the east. There is a modern church in the village, which is well supplied with water from springs.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 86 =Modern era= Agriculture In addition to the cultivation of grapes, and figs, Deir Mimas continues to be a major producer of olives and olive oil. It is home to around 150000 olive trees some of which date back hundreds of years. Three olive oil press facilities are available providing their services to olive farmers from Deirmimas and surrounding villages. Olive oil produced in Deirmimas is known to be as one of the best in Lebanon. Olive Oil produced in Deirmimas under the name \\"Mariams Gold\\" ranked fourth among the products of more than 80 of the largest producing companies of the world in a contest organised by the German “Biofach 2012″ exhibition at Nuremberg , Germany. Demography The inhabitants of Deir Mimas are Lebanese and followers of the Eastern Orthodox, Presbyterian and Greek Catholic churches. Latin Church followers exist in the village in addition to a Maronite minority. One of the most known individuals from Deir Mimas is Dr. George Fawaz, a renowned former pharmacologist at the American University of Beirut. One of the priests that served most of his entire life is buried at the back of the church in Mar Mama. His name was the servant of God Gerges Chammas. The location is behind the church to the east side. He was a great servant and devoted his life to serve Christ and his followers. Etymology According to E. H. Palmer the name means: \\"the convent of Mimâs\\".Palmer, 1881, p. 20 Deir is derivative from the Semitic, meaning house or convent. Mimas refers to Saint Mamas, the third century shepherd who preached Christianity and had a lion as a protector. Saint Mamas became martyr after his examination in the persecutions of Aurelian. In the Middle Ages, a convent was built in honor of Saint Mamas on top of a hill surrounded by olive groves. A village grew around the convent, and it was eventually named in honor of the Convent of Saint Mamas.Deirmimas Holidays In addition to Christmas and Easter, the town celebrates the feast of Saint Mamas on September 15. Grand festivities are organized each year to honor the town's patron saint. Celebrations take place where masses are held at the ”Deir” the Convent situated on a hill and facing the mountain and the litani river. Villagers meet, talk and gather over a nice array of food that many housewives have prepared. Churches Deirmimas is considered as the closest Lebanese Christion village to the Holy land. It is 70km far from Nazareth and 170km far from Jerusalem. The village has seven different churches serving the population: 1\\\\. Saint Mamas Monastery for the Greek Orthodox 2\\\\. Saint Michel Church for the Greek Orthodox 3\\\\. Saint Mamas Church for the Melkite Catholics 4\\\\. Santa Maria Monastery for the Latin Catholics 5\\\\. Santa Maria Church for the Latin Catholics 6\\\\. Protestant Church 7\\\\. Deirmimas Baptist Church Saint Mamas Monastery for the Greek Orthodox The monastery of St. Mema from which Deirmimas takes its name was built around 1404 A.D. The original monastery was a simple medieval construction with 6 monks’ cells, situated by a small church. The monastery fell into decay and was restored a number of times, most recently in 2004 before it was totally demolished during the 2006 Israeli war on Lebanon. The present plan for the reconstruction of the site, which has been financed by Qatar, began in 2008 and has replaced the old monastery with a much larger construction. The site has been inaugurated by the ruler of Qatar and the Lebanese authorities in 2010. Since, the Monastery is open daily to all devotees and visitors from 9:00am to 7:00pm. Unlike the West, where Christmas ranks supreme, in the East it is Easter, centered on the cross and the resurrection of Christ. Another supreme festival of the year is the St. Mema's festival on 15 September. On that day people take part in divine liturgy, after which they gather around for outdoor feast where everyone joins in to eat, drink and enjoy themselves. The monastery is placed under the aegis of Father Salim Assaad who was given the reins of a ruined monastery and turned it not only into a peaceful place of worship but into a small museum for iconography. The icons are the most sacred, the most transcendent art that exists for the Orthodox Christians. The Monastery of St. Mema decorated with much admired mosaics depicting the life of Christ has been made the house of many windows into the kingdom of God.

It first aired on March 2, 1974. The character of Lieutenant Colonel Sam Flagg (played by Edward Winter) was first introduced by name in this episode. Winter portrayed a similar character called Captain Halloran eleven episodes earlier in \\"Deal Me Out\\", and the two are implied in \\"Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?\\" to have been one and the same. Flagg has any number of aliases. Overview After a helicopter crash at the 4077 M*A*S*H the only casualty is the infamous LTC (Lieutenant Colonel) Flagg who is laid up at the 4077th with a broken arm. He reveals that he suspects a security leak in the camp and will be investigating, presenting LTC Henry Blake with a number of aliases and demanding his full cooperation. Meanwhile, Hawkeye and Trapper John meet Trapper's friend Captain Pratt, who is an Army Intelligence officer. Pratt is undercover at the hospital to see what Flagg is up to, suspecting that Flagg had ordered the helicopter to crash and then broke his own arm in order to \\"infiltrate\\" the 4077th. Pratt explains his presence in the camp to Frank Burns by saying that the US Army Engineers are thinking of making MASHes amphibious—a story Frank gullibly believes. Pratt also blackmails Henry into cooperating with him by showing him evidence of his numerous marital infidelities while in the US. Soon the two spies are after each other, and Hawkeye and Trapper John decide to have some fun by tricking both spies into going after Major Frank Burns, making Pratt believe Burns is a right wing fascist and making Flagg believe Burns is a left wing communist.  Notes  *In episode 3.23 when Lieutenant Colonel Flagg appears, Hawkeye and Trapper remark on how the last time he was at the 4077th, Flagg not only broke his own arm {seen in this episode} but rigged a jeep to run over himself—this last incident is not in this episode but did appear in Episode 2.13, Flagg's/Halloran's first appearance, which includes a minor plot about a local man (\\"Whiplash Wang\\") who throws himself in front of U.S. Army vehicles to feign injury for profit; in this episode, Flagg similarly intentionally injures himself with an Army vehicle to advance his investigation. *An anachronism appears in this episode. As Radar pretends to be asleep when Flagg leaves Henry's office, a copy of Avengers (vol. 1) #60 can be seen on his chest, which was not published until 1968. *At the end of the episode's second act, Pratt takes pictures of the \\"Swamp\\" with a spy camera; the final scene (commonly deleted in syndication) has Flagg narrating over slides of various characters and recommending further observation of the 4077th. *The season 4 episode \\"The Late Captain Pierce\\" features a character named Captain Pratt, but is a different character from the Pratt in this episode.

It was lost on a test run the same year, and is believed to lie on the seabed of the bay of Valparaiso. History The Flach was built in 1866 at the request of the Chilean government, by Karl Flach, a German engineer and immigrant. It was the fifth submarine built in the world and, along with a second submarine, was intended to defend the port of Valparaiso against attack by the Spanish navy during the Chincha Islands War. (The second vessel, built by Gustavo Heyermann, sank on its maiden voyage.) =Loss= Karl Flach and his son On 3 May 1866, after several days of successful testing, Karl Flach, his son, and nine other Chilean and German crewmen boarded the submarine for another test run. During the test, the submarine sank for unknown reasons; it is now thought to lie at a depth of about 50 meters (164 feet) within the bay of Valparaiso. The Flach was located two days after the sinking by seamen from the English frigate HMS Leander, and a diver named John Wallace was able to see and draw the wreck, which was buried nose-down in the bay's sediment. =Present location= The Chilean Navy, with support from others, has searched for the submarine and intends to raise it after finding it, even though there is as yet no agreement on what to do with the remains of the eleven bodies thought to be inside. A finding of an object that appears to be the Flach was reported in El Mercurio de Valparaiso on 25 April 2007. However, the finding has not been confirmed, because, as of August 2007, sediment still has to be cleared away from the object. See also *H.L.

Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks frequently questions Zimmer's constant use of ghostwriters and writing music using a \\"lowest common denominator\\" approach.http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/pirates_caribbean4.htmlhttp://www.filmtracks.com/titles/dark_knight_rises.htmlhttp://www.filmtracks.com/titles/man_steel.htmlhttp://www.filmtracks.com/titles/amazing_spiderman2.htmlhttp://www.filmtracks.com/titles/batman_superman.html James Southall of Movie-Wave commented, \\"Zimmer’s way of writing scores goes pretty much like this – he comes up with some “ideas” at an early stage, these ideas are then turned into a suite of music (sometimes with the assistance of Lorne Balfe), and when the actual scoring begins, the film is split into chunks and each chunk gets allocated to a team at Remote Control, who take music from the suite and apply it to their scenes...but there is always the danger that with so many cooks having a go at the broth, they want their own part to stand out, seem like the most important, and in the end nothing seems important\\". http://www.movie-wave.net/the-dark-knight-rises/ Jonathan Broxton of Movie Music UK remarked, \\"What I hate, however, is the way in which the company has virtually taken over the upper echelons of the film music world, to the detriment of other, independent composers who can’t catch a break. Five of the 15 highest grossing films at the US box office in 2009 and seven of the 15 highest grossing films in 2008 were scored by Zimmer or someone who used to work for him. Such is their utter dominance of the “blockbuster sound” that producers and directors wanting a piece of the box office pie return time after time to the studio, not for new or innovative music, but for another variation on the last hit movie’s score, one which won’t upset the film’s target demographic, and creativity be damned.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100723150112/http://www.moviemusicuk.us/clashtitans2010cd.htm In hindsight, Remote Control Productions and Zimmer have been accused of having a monopoly in film music, where filmmakers hire members of Remote Control to create music that sounds similar to Zimmer's style instead of hiring independent composers for their own styles.

The game is a statistically based sports game that simulates the play of American football. Each player's statistics are gathered, analyzed, and then converted into numerical results which reflect each player's production for a given year. These numerical results are placed on a set of cards, with each team having its own set. In addition, a team's defensive ratings for a season are converted into card data that determines how many yards may be gained against that defense.Strat-o- matic football user's manual. 2001 Gameplay The original game is played with dice and cards. In playing a typical game, each athlete is represented by a player card, on which are printed various ratings and result tables for dice rolls. A player, who may play solitaire or against another player, is in charge of making strategic and personnel decisions for his/her team, while determining the results of his/her decisions by cross-referencing dice rolls with a system of printed charts and tables. A game of Strat-O-Matic Pro Football takes approximately 60 minutes to play. Strat-O-Matic Pro Football is also available as a personal computer game faithfully adapted from the board game. One of the main features of the computer game is the inclusion of team- specific computer managers which will call plays and make player substitutions to simulate all of the real-life NFL teams Strat-O-Matic has released on the computer game (approximately 20 seasons from 1957 through the present). These computer managers present a competitive challenge to those who may find it difficult to find a live opponent for the board game. In addition, computer game players of Strat-O-Matic Pro Football may play head-to-head online and there are many customer-created leagues set up specifically for head-to-head play. Although Strat-O-Matic Football is a simplification of the complicated game it simulates, there is a great deal of strategy involved. The person or computer controlling the team on offense and the person or computer controlling the team on defense for a particular play each secretly choose a play to call from among a handful of plays and in the case of defense chooses player movement if any. If the defensive play and/or player movement are designed to be effective against the choice of offensive play (this is the goal of the person or computer controlling the defensive team) then the play is less likely to be successful for the offense. For example, if the defense calls \\"pass\\" and the offense calls a passing play then the play is less likely to be successful; further, if the defense chooses to double-team a specific receiver for the pass and the pass is intended for that receiver then the play is significantly less likely to be successful though choosing to double-team may open up other types of plays to be successful. Field goals, punts, and kickoffs are also handled individually within the game and while there is, similar to the NFL, strategy involved in when to use these plays (for example, on 4th down whether to attempt a field goal, to punt, or to go for a first down) there is little strategy associated with these kicking plays. Each game is decided by an approximately equal amount of strategy, player talent (cards and ratings of players used in the game), and luck. A coach may win a game with a lot of luck but will likely not be successful in the long term without either good strategy or good players (or both). When two humans are playing a game of Strat-O-Matic Football there is a significant amount of “cat-and- mouse” type strategy. For example, coach A may call a long pass on 3rd down and 2 yards to go in order to take advantage of his belief that coach B may weaken his long pass defense (by emptying his long pass zone) in an effort to strengthen his defense against shorter yardage plays (specifically runs and flat/lookin passes) on that specific play. However, coach B may be careful not to empty his long pass zone in this situation in order not to give up the big play. On the next 3rd down and 2 both coaches will be aware of what occurred on the previous 3rd down and 2 situation and may adjust their strategy accordingly. Coaches who have good intuition in predicting the plays their opponents will call may gain a competitive advantage. There are many coaching styles of playing the game which leads to diversity in playing games against different opponents. Some coaches like to call very few risky offensive plays as they call mostly runs and low risk flat/lookin passes while other coaches like to call a significant number of risky and potentially rewarding long passes. Some coaches call defensive plays with less risk such as calling run or pass without moving players (i.e. without weakening one zone to strengthen another) while other coaches gamble more on defense. This diversity is considered to be a strong point of the game as a whole and is a testament to the realism of the game as this coaching style diversity also exists in the NFL. =Modes of play= There are two primary modes of play for Strat-O-Matic Computer Football: #Play solo against the computer manager either setting up a league or simply playing a non-league game; #Play online against others live, one participant (the “host”) gives his IP address to the other participant who types in the IP address to join the host either within a league or simply playing a non-league game. =League types= There are two primary types of leagues (either solo or online): #Stock league in which NFL teams in their entirety are used without any modification to team rosters. For example, many people play solo stock leagues in which they play an entire season for one or more NFL teams (usually for their favorite NFL team) while the computer auto- plays all of the other games in that season. As another example there are many stock leagues for online play in which each participant controls one NFL team for an entire season. #Draft league in which teams are created from a shared pool of NFL players. For example, there are many draft leagues for online play in which each participant drafts from a pool of all NFL players from a particular season (often the most recently completed NFL season) and participants compete in the league with the team of players they drafted. =Alternate versions= In 1976 Strat-O-Matic produced the first version of its college football game. This board game is similar to the pro version in play calling, outcomes, timing and use of the 20 card \\"split\\" deck. The differences between the pro and college game are listed below. #Once the offensive and defensive plays have been called the result is derived from the differential of natural numbers (offense - defense) from two simultaneously played cards. The difference is then used to enter the proper cell of the team sheet (odd numbers use the offensive sheet, even use defensive) to get the result. Thus the randomness of the dice roll in the pro version is eliminated. However, since the offensive and defensive players can both play numbers 1 to 10 (in addition to the play call), the basic game play calling is more complex than that of the pro version; #No individual players are used per se. Each team is represented by two sheets - a red and blue two sided scrimmage sheet and a special teams sheet (kickoffs, returns, etc.). In spite of this, Strat- O-Matic did include a brochure listing the lead offensive playmakers for the given team and given year; #Solitaire play is much more difficult in the first college version (because of the absence of dice). The game is really designed to be played face to face by two to four players; #Finally, the first college edition features the opportunity to play teams from different times. The game includes teams from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and is designed so that the matchups accurately represent the strengths of schedules. The company only produced the version for a couple of years and replaced it with the second version which plays almost exactly as the pro football game. =Plays= There are 5 primary running plays and 5 primary passing plays for the offense to choose from and the offense must also choose the intended target for the play: the ball carrier for a running play or the intended receiver for a passing play. The 5 running plays are End Run Left, Off Tackle Left, Linebuck, Off Tackle Right, and End Run Right. Choice of left or right makes a difference in the yardage gained or lost on a play only in two ways: a) determining which offensive and defensive players are involved in trying to block for or tackle the ball carrier and b) whether or not the defense has strengthened its run defense on that side. For example, if the offensive coach believes that the defensive coach will strengthen his run defense against End Run Left then if the offensive coach still wants to run an End Run he should choose End Run Right. Each of the 3 types of runs (End Run, Off Tackle, and Linebuck) uses its own columns on the ball carrier’s cards and on the defensive cards. Some ball carriers are very poor on Linebucks compared to the other two run types, some other ball carriers are very poor on End Runs compared to the other two run types, and some ball carriers are fairly balanced. Choice of which running play to use is often based upon running behind the better offensive linemen and avoiding running towards the better defensive linemen; for example, if the middle of the offensive line (Center and both Guards) is its strength then Linebuck may be a good choice unless the offensive coach believes that the defensive coach may strengthen his defense against the Linebuck. The 5 passing plays are Flat Pass Left, Lookin, Flat Pass Right, Short Pass, and Long Pass. Flat Pass Left, Lookin, and Flat Pass Right are the same type of passing play and use the same columns for resolution; choice of left, right, or middle (lookin) makes a difference in play resolution in two ways: a) determining which defender is involved in attempting to defend the play and b) whether or not the defense has strengthened (or weakened) its flat/lookin defense in that specific target zone. Flat/lookin passes are designed to gain approximately 4-10 yards when successful although they may go for much more or much less (including negative yardage for flat passes but not for lookin passes) depending upon the defensive play called, player movement, player talent (cards and ratings), and the luck of the dice on the play. Short passes are designed to gain 10-15 yards when successful although they may go for more yardage. Long passes are designed to gain 25 or more yards when successful. Flat/lookin passes are the least risky of the 3 pass types as interception and sack chances are low while long passes incur the greatest risk of interception or sack of the 3 pass types. There are 4 defensive plays to choose from: Run, Pass, Short Yardage, and Run-Key. Run and Pass are the primary plays while Short Yardage is designed to focus even more than Run on helping support against a running play (while further weakening the defense against a pass) and Run-Key is designed to focus on attempting to completely stop a specific ball carrier (while very significantly weakening the defense against a pass). In addition, there are many variations of defensive player movement allowed as all linebackers and the free safety are eligible to move into some adjacent zones (or farther in some cases) including blitzing and are eligible to double-team receivers (within limits). For example, a defensive coach may call pass (which does not guard well against a run) and move one or more of his linebackers to the line of scrimmage to blitz (to attempt to sack the Quarterback for a loss of yards) and also to strengthen support against the run; the advantage of blitzing linebackers while calling pass is to increase the chance for a sack and to strengthen support against the run but the disadvantage of this call is that the linebacker would vacate his flat or lookin zone leaving that type of pass with significantly less support. As another example, the free safety who is generally responsible for helping support against the long pass may instead strengthen another zone such as a flat or lookin zone, the offense does not have the capability of changing the play he has already selected but the offense may call more long passes in the future to try to take advantage of the open long pass zone if the defense moves his free safety again. Similarities and differences with regard to fantasy football Strat-O-Matic Football draft leagues appeal to many fans of fantasy football. In a fantasy football league participants compile a team of NFL players and as the current NFL season progresses the success of participants' teams is measured by the performance of the NFL players on their team. In a Strat-O-Matic Football draft league participants compile a team of NFL players whose cards and ratings measuring their in-game performance are determined from a prior NFL season – usually the most recently completed season although there are many draft leagues which use much older seasons instead based upon the preferences of members within the league – and participants play games using Strat-O-Matic Football. In this way participants are not only building their team of NFL players but they are also greatly affecting the outcome with the strategies they use during the game. In a Strat-O-Matic Football draft league participants craft their teams by drafting individual players based in large part on their own preferences. For example, one league participant may focus on drafting a team with a good running game (by drafting good running backs and offensive linemen early in the draft) while another participant may focus on drafting a good run defense and/or a good pass defense; other participants may focus on a more balanced approach. It is up to individual participant to decide how to craft his team during the draft and often this decision is based upon the participant’s style of play during a game. Both Strat-O-Matic Football and fantasy football have many “keeper” draft leagues in which NFL players are retained from one year to the next. In a keeper league participants who are able to evaluate and draft good players over the long term will excel. For example, if a keeper draft league participant drafts a player of who is young and remains good for several years then that participant will gain the benefit of the player's performances for those years unless the participant trades the player to another participant. One additional appeal of Strat-O-Matic Football keeper leagues is that it gives the participants an additional interest in watching the performances of their players during NFL games. A great majority of online Strat-O-Matic Football draft leagues are keeper leagues. Strat-O-Matic also has a college football computer game which uses the same computer game engine as the pro game with rules modified to match the rules of college football. All of the 1-A and 1-AA teams are represented in the college game and while each player on each team has his own card or rating these cards and ratings are based more on team performance than on individual performance (unlike the pro game in which each player's card or rating represents his individual play for that season). Just as in the pro game Strat-O-Matic's college football game may be played against the computer or online against a live opponent in a league or non-league game. Unlike the pro game the college game teams do not each have their own customized computer manager but each team does have an appropriate one out of a couple dozen overall computer managers which will approximately reflect the team's real-life performance.

The Letterheads meet for hand lettering rallies and to exchange lost \\"tricks of the trade\\" and accumulated skills. History Originated in Denver, Colorado in 1975 by a group of sign shop apprentices and sign artists; Rick Flores, John Frazier, Bob Mitchell, Mark Oatis, Mike Rielly, Earl Vehill, Mike Author, Joe Tedesco, Jim Schultz. and Noel Weber. The term \\"Letterheads\\" was coined by Earl Vehill. All were unified by an interest in sign design principles and techniques which were no longer taught or valued by most of the contemporary classes, or by the shops in which they worked. Many were understudies of the Jerry Albright, and all were acquainted with sign artist Larry Albaugh, in whose studio many early meetings were held. It was Albaugh who commonly invoked the I.O.A.F.S. acronym, which persists among longtime practitioners to this day. The early gatherings were informal, and consisted of a fair amount of partying, centered around discussions of the sign trade. Sharing, exemplified by Jerry Albright, became the strength of the group. Together with this dedication to sharing and participation was an especial focus upon books and resources, particularly sign instruction and lettering manuals dating to the early 1900s. Throughout the 1970s, meetings were confined to Colorado but membership began to grow. Keith Knecht, out of Ohio, joined early on. Knecht, a well-known signmaker and pinstriper who began his career in 1956, died August 30, 2011, at the age of 71. Hundreds of new members joined during the early 1980s, and the movement took off from there. There was a meeting at Noel's in the summer of 1982 and then Mike Jackson's Oklahoma meet in October of the same year. Raymond Chapman had a Texas gathering in November, 1983. The composition of the seminal group, as well as the timeline of early meetings, is a matter of record within the sign industry, and can be verified by a review of letters and articles published in Signs of the Times and Sign Craft magazines. The group now has grown worldwide and numbers in the thousands. The Letterheads traditionally gather for one annual \\"International\\" meet in the US or Canada, as well as 10 or more smaller regional meets throughout, but not limited to, the US, Canada, Australia and the UK. 2005 marked the first meet held in Greece. Meets typically last for several days, and consist of attendees participating in lettering, striping, carving, gold leafing (gilding) and often glass art. Besides the incredible amount of talent and skill demonstrated during these events, it is the free exchange of knowledge and camaraderie amongst people of the same trade that makes these weekends remarkable. Several \\"walldog\\" meets have occurred over the years, where the Letterheads have gathered to teach, learn and practice large mural painting. One of these took place in 1997, in Belvidere, Illinois. Over 300 artists from all over the world joined forces to create nine murals in three days. The work was donated by the artists to the town of Belvidere, with all compositions depicting the town's history. The Letterhead mission is to pass on trade \\"secrets\\" and skills through the ages, \\"keeping their craft alive\\" for future generations. With the onset of computers and vinyl films for signmaking, the Letterhead mission of passing down the traditional skills is more important today than ever before.

It has verticillaster inflorescence. It is naturalized in many other parts of the world, including South, Central and North Americas. Description Leonurus sibiricus is an herbaceous annual or biennial with upright stems that grow from tall. Plants have long petioled basal leaves that are ovate-cordate in shape. The leaves have toothed margins and are incised with deeply cut lobes. Typically one or a few flowering stems are produced from short tap-roots. The lower stem leaves are deciduous and wither away as the plants begin blooming. The petioles of the leaves, midway up the stems are long. The flowers are produced in many flowered verticillasters, produced in whorls around the top half or more of the stem. The flowers are sessile with long calices that are tubular-campanulate in shape. The corolla is white or reddish to purple-red, with an upper lip that is oblong in shape and longer than the lower lip. When flowering is done, brown oblong shaped nutlets are produced in good number. Blooming occurs from July into late September, but flowering can occur year- round when climate permits. This species' habitat within its natural range is stony or sandy grasslands or pine forests.

The area, still semi-rural, was historically on the border of English control and featured a defensive construction, Carrickmines Castle, which became the subject of national controversy during the building of a late stage of Dublin's M50 orbital motorway. Character Traditionally a rural area, and today a semi-rural suburban region, Carrickmines is now divided northeast/southwest by the M50 motorway, with, to the northeast, more established residential areas, and to the southwest, including along Glenamuck Road, new retail parks, office buildings, housing schemes and apartments. Geography Carrickmines developed as a settlement in the more than 6 km long valley of the same name, which contains the modest Carrickmines River and its tributaries. The Ballyogan, Glenamuck and Golf Streams all merge in the vicinity. Downstream at Brennanstown the river merges with St. Bride's Stream, from Foxrock, to form the Loughlinstown River, which in turn meets the Bride's Glen Stream to form the Shanganagh River, which reaches the sea at Killiney Strand. Leopardstown lies to the northwest, Foxrock to the north, Cabinteely to the northeast and Brennanstown to the east, Ballyogan to the west, Glenamuck to the south, and Laughanstown to the southeast. History =Carrickminders= Remains of The Carrickminders camp, January 2004 During the construction of the M50 motorway, Carrickmines gained national notoriety when anti-roads protesters calling themselves the Carrickminders set up camp in the area and delayed the completion of the M50 for two years with legal challenges being taken by Vincent Salafia. The objectors claimed that the underground remains of Carrickmines Castle, an Anglo-Norman fort built in the 12th century on the edge of the Pale, was of national importance. Today, much of the uncovered remains are preserved in tunnels and other structures scattered around the interchange. Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council claimed the action greatly increased the cost of the project, which was eventually completed in August 2005. =Development= Junction 15 of the M50 lies at the centre of Carrickmines. The retail park and developments on Glenamuck Road have converted the semi-rural area into a mix of suburban complex, with shops, offices, apartment blocks and housing estates, and a patchwork of remaining farmland. =Retail park= The retail park at Carrickmines, The Park Carrickmines, contains a mixture of retail and office space. It was sold for €100m in 2006, and reportedly garnered the highest retail park rents in Ireland in 2014. In 2015 it was reported as the best performing Irish retail park by The Sunday Times. =2015 blaze= On 10 October 2015, a large fire swept through a halting site on Glenamuck Road. Transport The LUAS Green Line Carrickmines Park and Ride stop lies in the north-east of the settlement. It is also served by regular Go-Ahead Ireland 63 and 63A services which pass through Carrickmines on their route from Dún Laoghaire to Kilternan. Carrickmines railway station originally lay on the Dublin and South Eastern Railway's Harcourt Street branch line. It opened on 10 July 1854, but finally closed on 1 January 1959.

It has grown and flourished since 1982 and now looks forward to a year of celebration of 25 years of young people playing together. The idea of creating an ensemble which would perform under the banner of the Galway Youth Orchestra started with a young Cork graduate, Maire Ni Dhuibhir in Spiddal and developed initially by gathering players from school orchestras in Galway City, Loughrea and Tuam. Very quickly this orchestra developed an identity of its own and since then the G.Y.O. has been shaped and developed by a number of conductors and hundreds of young players. Junior Orchestra Players, nine years and upwards, who are at a playing level equivalent to Grade 1 Associated Boards or Primary R.I.A.M. can audition for Junior Orchestra. They are usually ready to move to the Intermediate Orchestra when they are Grade 3 standard. In Junior Orchestra they are taught the basics of looking at the conductor and taking and interpreting his/her directions. They learn to listen to each other and become aware of intonation and learn the necessity of counting and keeping rhythm. These early years are also about honing their sight-reading skills because an orchestra player has a personal responsibility for reading their music. Intermediate Orchestra Players in this orchestra need to be at around a good Grade 3 or 4 standard. The instrumental skills are markedly more advanced than the average Junior and consequently the difficulty level of the music is higher requiring more developed technique. At this level the players are being trained to notice the dynamics and to be aware of the colour and texture of the written music. The classical repertoire is more extensive for this orchestra. Senior Orchestra Members of this orchestra need to be able to play at a good grade 6 or 7 standard as this is the basic level that the conductors aim for if they wish to include symphonic works in their yearly programme. Works by the great composers are played in their original form and the Senior Orchestra needs to complete two full concert programmes in a year. Alouette Wind Band To address the cyclical surplus of flute and clarinet players in Junior and Intermediate Orchestra this ensemble was founded under the directorship of Joanne Cater in 2005. It proved to be so successful that it has now become established as a G.Y.O. ensemble and is open to both Junior and Intermediate members and players who are not attached to an orchestra.

A member of the National Salvation Front (FSN), he was Minister of the Interior in the Petre Roman cabinets, carrying his mandate between the Mineriads of 1990 and 1991. Biography Born in Turnu Severin, Ursu graduated from the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Law, and later received his PhD from the same institution. Profile at the Chamber of Deputies site He worked for the Bucharest Military Tribunal, serving as its vice president and, later, its president. Following the 1989 Revolution, he became Minister of the Interior on June 16, 1990, when his predecessor, General Mihai Chițac, was relieved from office. First Roman cabinet, at the Rompres siteTraian Ungureanu, \\"Dosar: mineriada\\" (\\"Dossier: the Mineriad\\") , in 22, Nr.797, June 2005 This came in the wake of the June 1990 Mineriad, when miners from the Jiu Valley repressed the civic protest in Bucharest's University Square (known as the Golaniad). Ursu's alleged involvement in the events remains the topic of controversy, and his name repeatedly surfaced among those accused of covering up the actual death-toll and overall scale of violence. In 2003, Ziua newspaper reported that Ursu had authored an official account of the events in which he acknowledged that the miners had been transported to Bucharest with assistance from the authorities, that Chițac had ordered troops to offer the miners their full support and to open fire on demonstrators, and that as many as 1,200 protesters had been arrested. Răzvan Savaliuc, \\"Diversiunile lui Chiţac\\" (\\"Chiţac's Diversions\\") , in Ziua, June 13, 2003 Official data authored by Ursu and Prosecutor-General Gheorghe Robu, released soon after the events, accounted for 185 people arrested. Gabriela Gheorghe, Adelina Huminic, \\"Istoria mineriadelor din anii 1990-1991\\" (\\"The History of the 1990-1991 Mineriads\\") , in Sfera Politicii He lost his position after the Roman government was deposed by the new September 1991 Mineriad, but was appointed Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Theodor Stolojan cabinet, and later Secretary of State, head of the Department for Local Public Administration. In 1992, Ursu rallied with the opposition party formed around the pro-Roman faction of the FSN -- known after 1993 under as the Democratic Party (PD) --, and won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies for Argeș County during the election of that year. Subsequently, he served on the Committee for Public Administration, Territorial Improvement and Environmental Balance, and on the Permanent Committee of the Chamber and Senate for Exercising Parliamentary Control over the Activity of the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI). He left the PD in March 1995, and carried out his mandate as an independent. In April 2005, the Association of Mineriad Victims argued that it had gathered enough evidence to incriminate Ursu, together with former President Ion Iliescu and former Premier Petre Roman, for having organized and profited from the June 1990 events \\"Petre Roman- audiat în dosarul mineriadei\\" (\\"Petre Roman - Cited in the Mineriad Dossier\\"), at BBC Romanian edition, April 20, 2005 (replying on this issue, Roman argued that his cabinet had itself been targeted by the miners). The Association's president, Viorel Ene, specifically accused Ursu and, among others, the SRI's Virgil Măgureanu, General Pavel Abraham, and Counter Admiral Cico Dumitrescu, of having overseen the transport of protesters arrested in downtown Bucharest to military facilities around the capital, an illegal measure which, reportedly, also resulted in a widespread incidence of beatings and the murder of several prisoners. During the 2004-2005 season, Doru Viorel Ursu served as President of the Romanian Football Federation's Disciplinary Commission; he resigned in May 2005, citing irregularities in procedures (according to Ursu, sanctions for misconduct prescribed for local soccer clubs were regularly below standards imposed by FIFA).\\"Doru Viorel Ursu a demisionat de la conducerea Comisiei de Disciplină a FRF\\" (\\"Doru Viorel Ursu Has Resigned from the Leadership of the Romanian Football Federation's Disciplinary Commission\\"), in Adevărul, May 17, 2005 (hosted by kappa.ro) References Category:Football in Romania Category:Democratic Liberal Party (Romania) politicians Category:People from Drobeta-Turnu Severin Category:Romanian lawyers Category:Romanian Ministers of Interior Category:University of Bucharest alumni Category:1953 births Category:Living people ","title":"Doru Viorel Ursu"},{"id":"10734536","text":"Black point compensation is a technique used in digital photography printing.

A hundred years after his death, the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 would designate Lafite and Latour as First Growths, Mouton as a second growth and Calon-Ségur as a third growth. Early history Nicolas-Alexandre was the son of Alexandre de le Meon de Ségur de Francs et Portugaises and Marie-Thérèse de Clausel and paternal grandson of Jean-Isaac, marquis de Ségur (d. 1707), military commander and a descendant of François de Ségur, seigneur de Sainte- Aulaye (d. 1605).

The Ségur name has appeared to be in the Royal line from time to time. Through his maternal grandfather, he would inherit Château Latour. In 1716, Alexandre de Ségur bought Château Lafite and following his death, that occurred soon after, the estate passed on to Nicolas-Alexandre.

See also Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 133. The availability of a deficiency judgment depends on whether the lender has a recourse or nonrecourse loan, which is largely a matter of state law. In some jurisdictions, the original loan(s) obtained to purchase property is/are non-recourse, but subsequent refinancing of a first mortgage and/or acquisition of a 2nd (3rd, etc.) are recourse loans. In short, many jurisdictions hold that the loans obtained at the acquisition of a property (\\"purchase-money\\") are non-recourse, and most, if not all, subsequent loans are recourse. States that follow the title (trust-deed) theory of mortgages typically allow non-judicial foreclosure procedures, which are fast, but do not allow deficiency judgments. States that follow the lien theory of mortgages require judiciary foreclosure procedures, but allow deficiency judgments against the debtor, although some states have narrowed the time periods to seek a deficiency judgment. It is important to note that there is a difference between a deficiency and a deficiency judgment. A \\"deficiency\\" is the difference between the amount owed on a loan and the total amount received/collected at the closing of a loan. A deficiency judgment is a court judgment that is a public record of the amount owed and by whom. In many states, items included in calculating the amount of a deficiency judgment include: the loan principal, accrued interest and attorney fees, less the amount the lender bid at the foreclosure sale. In 2014 Geoff Walsh, a staff attorney with the U.S. National Consumer Law Center, said on NPR that the United States is \\"seeing an uptick\\" in the pursuit of deficiency claims, because technological developments have enabled large debt-buying institutions and mortgage insurers to more easily pursue former borrowers, who often don't know their legal rights.

The BOP is responsible for maintaining the custody of anyone convicted of committing a federal crime. To achieve this goal, the BOP maintains a number of correctional facilities, which are divided into six regions, throughout the US. These facilities house approximately 211,195http://bop.gov inmates of varying security levels. Facilities are designated as either minimum, medium, maximum, or the most recent addition, super max. To help maintain security within facilities under its control, the BOP has formed a number of specialized tactical, and emergency response units. Operating under the direct control of the BOPs Office of Emergency Preparedness, these units consist of Special Operations Response Teams, or SORTs; Disturbance Control Teams; and Hostage Negotiation Teams. The Office of Emergency Preparedness was established in May 1990 and is responsible for overseeing the agency's SORT program and coordinating emergency response capabilities. It also acts as a liaison office with other agencies during crisis situations. SORTs are highly trained tactical units capable of responding to prison disturbances and providing assistance to other law enforcement agencies during emergencies. Foundation The first SORT was formed in 1982 at the United States Penitentiary (USP) Leavenworth, Kansas. The team was formed as a response to the increasing level of violence being encountered in facility. A second team came on line shortly afterward at the USP Marion, Illinois. Currently all federal correctional complexes and higher level security facilities are required to maintain a SORT. Scenarios Possible scenarios that may require the deployment of a SORT are: *Riots *Assault on staff or inmates *Escapes or attempted escapes *Hostage situations *Any terrorist or military strike on the United States Personnel SORT members (Operators) are selected based on a vigorously physical and mental process. All operators are selected from the host facility's staff. Each SORT member has a regular duty assignment and is assigned to the SORT on a collateral basis. SORTs will primarily operate at their host facility but are on call to respond to any incident that may occur at any BOP or federal controlled facility. The leader of a SORT team can be of any rank, SORT teams are composed of 15+ personnel from various departments within the institution. Each team will have a number of specialist personnel assigned to it, such as: *An EMT *A certified firearms instructor *A rappel master *A security specialist/locksmith *A blueprint expert *A sniper/spotter team *A forced entry specialist trained in the use of explosives *A chemical agents specialist Training SORTs receive their initial training, and certification from the Office of Emergency Management, and are required to train for at least 8 hours a month. Most facilities dedicate at least 16 hours to training, with many more hours of personnel time spent honing skills. Monthly training includes firearms instruction, tactical planning, emergency medical care, rappelling, physical training, riot control techniques and other skills as deemed necessary. To maintain their certification teams participate in an annual regional training exercise. The teams are evaluated and ranked using national standards developed by the Office Of Emergency Preparedness. Teams found to be lacking any particular areas are given remedial training and brought up to standard. Teams are required to hold at least two mock emergency exercise per year to test their response to any potential crisis situation that may arise. All SORT members and other emergency BOP staff are equipped with work phones. If a situation develops that requires the use of the SORT, the team would be paged, and would respond to the facility. In the event a large scale emergency should arise, the BOP maintains palletized trailers of equipment at several storage areas around the country. BOP also maintains agreements with the Department of Defense (DOD) to have BOP personnel, and equipment transported on DOD aircraft. History BOP SORTs have participated in several high-profile events over the last few years. In 1991, Cuban inmates at Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Talladega, Alabama rioted and took several hostages. The BOP responded immediately by deploying several SORTs, and received additional assistance from the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team (HRT), along with several regional FBI SWAT teams. As the situation grew more tense, the order was given to storm the facility. The assault was initiated by the HRT, and the federal tactical units were successful in regaining control of the facility. Some of the lesser known operations that BOP SORTs have been involved in include the mass movement of inmates from FCI Miami, after the facility was damaged by Hurricane Andrew; and the resolution of inmate disturbances at FCI Oakdale, Louisiana, FCI Lawton, Oklahoma, and the USP Atlanta. In 1992 the first Rodney King beating trial came to a close. The officers charged with using excessive force to arrest Rodney king were found not guilty. The city erupted in a spasm of violence. The city of Los Angeles was unable to cope with the rising level of anarchy in its streets, and requested assistance from both the state and federal governments. The US government immediately ordered the deployment of federal troops and law enforcement agencies to the embattled city. The BOP dispatched several of its SORTs to the area who helped maintain control of federal facilities in the area. In 2020, SORT teams deployed to American cities, including Washington, D.C. as a part of the response to the George Floyd protests in Washington, D.C. and Miami, during the June 2020 unrest that followed after the murder of George Floyd. The SORTs in question did not wear identifying clothing or respond to questions about their affiliation. This led to some politicians and journalists decrying the use of unidentifiable federal law enforcement officers due to a lack of accountability. The SORTs were described by some as an \\"American secret police.\\" The attorney general defended their use. On July 20, 2020 Then President Donald Trump explicitly referenced SORTs as a political police: \\"Well, it depends on what your definition of “troops” is. I mean, we’re sending law enforcement. Portland was totally out of control. The Democrats — the liberal Democrats running the place had no idea what they were doing.\\"... \\" We’re looking at Chicago too. We’re looking at New York. Look at what's going on. All run by Democrats, all run by very liberal Democrats. All run, really, by radical left.\\" Uniform and equipment Uniforms consist of US Battle Dress uniforms, Kevlar helmets, and tactical foot wear. SORT equipment varies from team to team, with all teams being equipped with level IIIA body armor, and some type of load bearing vest. Additional protection is provided by the use of Body Bunker ballistic shields. SORT weapons include SIG Sauer P228 or Glock 19 pistols, Colt 9mm SMGs or HK MP5 SMGs, Benelli M1 Super 90 shotguns, McMillan M86 SR Sniper rifles, 37mm gas guns, diversionary devices, and chemical munitions.

A vector monitor, vector display, or calligraphic display is a display device used for computer graphics up through the 1970s. It is a type of CRT, similar to that of an early oscilloscope. In a vector display, the image is composed of drawn lines rather than a grid of glowing pixels as in raster graphics. The electron beam follows an arbitrary path tracing the connected sloped lines, rather than following the same horizontal raster path for all images. The beam skips over dark areas of the image without visiting their points. In 1963, Ivan Sutherland at MIT first used a vector graphic display for Sketchpad, his pioneering CAD program. In 1968, he and his team again used a vector monitor to display wireframe images of 3D models. This time the display was head mounted. The obviously heavy system was held up by a support arm structure called The Sword of Damocles. The system is widely considered to be the first computer-based virtual reality. In 1970, at the UK Farnborough Airshow, Sperry Gyroscope (Bracknell, England) exhibited the first ever vector graphic video display from a UK company. It featured an analogue monochrome display with special electronics, designed by Sperry's John Atkins, that allowed it to draw vectors on screen between two pairs of coordinates. At Farnborough the display was used to demonstrate the capabilities of the new Sperry 1412 military computer - it was shown running software that drew, in real time, a wire-frame rotating cube that could be speed-controlled in any of its three dimensions. That demonstration created significant interest in the Sperry 1412 computer, which then went on to be at the heart of a number of major projects for the French Navy and the Royal Navy during the period 1972 to 1992. Some refresh vector displays use a normal phosphor that fades rapidly and needs constant refreshing 30-40 times per second to show a stable image. These displays, such as the Imlac PDS-1, require some local refresh memory to hold the vector endpoint data. Other storage tube displays, such as the popular Tektronix 4010, use a special phosphor that continues glowing for many minutes. Storage displays do not require any local memory. In the 1970s, both types of vector displays were much more affordable than bitmap raster graphics displays when megapixel computer memory was still very expensive. Today, raster displays have replaced nearly all uses of vector displays. Vector displays do not suffer from the display artifacts of aliasing and pixelation—especially black and white displays; color displays keep some artifacts due to their discrete nature—but they are limited to displaying only a shape's outline (although advanced vector systems can provide a limited amount of shading). Text is crudely drawn from short strokes. Refresh vector displays are limited in how many lines or how much text can be shown without refresh flicker. Irregular beam motion is slower than steady beam motion of raster displays. Beam deflections are typically driven by magnetic coils, and those coils resist rapid changes to their current. Notable among vector displays are Tektronix large-screen computer terminals that use direct-view storage CRTs. (The CRT has at least one flood gun, and a special type of display screen, more complicated in principle than a simple phosphor.) But that permanent image cannot be easily changed. Like an Etch-a-Sketch, any deletion or movement requires erasing the entire screen with a bright green flash, and then slowly redrawing the entire image. Animation with this type of monitor is not practical. Vector displays were used for head-up displays in fighter aircraft because of the brighter displays that can be achieved by moving the electron beam more slowly across the phosphors. Brightness was critical because the display needed to be clearly visible to the pilot in direct sunlight. Asteroids-like video game played on an oscillograph configured in X-Y mode Vector monitors were also used by some late-1970s to mid-1980s arcade games such as Asteroids, Tempest, and Star Wars. Atari used the term Quadrascan to describe the technology when used in their video game arcades. Hewlett-Packard made a series of large-screen X-Y (vector) displays, the first of which was the 20MHz 8x10\\" model 1300. The CRT had an internal, specially contoured, very fine mesh operating at low potential, which was placed after the deflection plates at the gun exit. The 17KV electrostatic field between this mesh and the separate, conductive coating charged to final accelerating potential inside the CRT funnel, accelerated the electron beam axially as well as radially, expanding the possible image size to cover the 8x10\\" screen of the 17.75\\" long CRT. Without the mesh, the 8x10\\" CRT would have had to be almost three times as long. Expansion mesh technology was developed in the early 1960sPeter A. Keller (December 2007) Tektronix CRT History Part 6 - CRTs for Solid-State Instruments by the need to drive deflection plates at high frequencies in compact high-brightness CRTs operating at high acceleration voltages, to take advantage of the then-new transistor technology which was limited to only low voltages. The much bulkier and less efficient vacuum-tube electrostatic deflection amplifiers were able to operate at hundreds of volts. Color displays Some vector monitors are capable of displaying multiple colors, using either a typical shadow mask RGB CRT or two phosphor layers (so-called \\"penetration color\\"). Atari used the term color quadrascan to describe the shadow-mask version used in their video arcade games. In the penetration tubes, by controlling the strength of the electron beam, electrons can be made to reach (and illuminate) either or both phosphor layers, typically producing a choice of green, orange, or red. Tektronix made color oscilloscopes for a few years using penetration CRTs, but demand for these was low.

Since 1998, Ted Byfield and Felix Stalder have moderated the main list, coordinated moderation of other lists in the nettime \\"family,\\" and maintained the site as their nexus. The name nettime was chosen as a statement against space metaphors such as cyberspace, dominant at the time. > The time of nettime is a social time, it is subjective and intensive, with > condensation and extractions, segmented by social events like conferences > and little meetings, and text gatherings for export into the paper world. > Most people still like to read a text printed on wooden paper, more than > transmitted via waves of light.

Nettime has been widely recognized for its seminal role stimulating and disseminating ideas about Netzkritik or Net Critique, net.art, and tactical media and pioneered practices such as \\"collaborative filtering\\". For example, in 2004 nettime was nominated for an Ars Electronica Golden Nica award. However, the moderators refuse to speak or act as representatives of an organization, preferring instead to serve inasmuch as possible as coordinators of a loose or \\"headless\\" collective. The list and related meetings were a strong influence on Bruce Sterling's 1996 science fiction novel Holy Fire. Initially, it was both part of an early wave of, and served as an inspiration for, a number of related efforts such as Blast (1995–1998), Rhizome (1996–present), Fibreculture (2001–present), Faces-l and -empyre- (2002–present). Unlike these other efforts, which typically sought to affiliate themselves with institutions in order to become institutionalized, nettime has remained independent — at times fiercely so. Thus, unusually for a mailing list, the family of lists has successfully migrated across a series of hosts — many of them culturally significant in their own right — including in- berlin.de, desk.nl, material.net, thing.net, De Waag kein.org, and bitnik.org. From the beginning, the aim has been to provide a space for a new form of critical discourse on and with the nets, focussing on longer, substantive, yet non-academic writings and discussions. Nettime served early on as a pre- publishing and discussion platform to give critical thinkers and writers an international reach. Due to its particular political style, it was often seen as a European online salon, even though it had from the beginning strong non- European, mainly North-American participation. The list, once called \\"the world's most world list\\" by Bruce Sterling, has been characterized by pragmatic approach with relatively little change to its format over the years, which has proven to be resilient and durable. The expansive projects of building a web-based platforms, reacting to and generating growing controversies, were unsustainable.Lovink, Geert (2002). \\"The Moderation Question: Nettime and the Boundaries of Mailing List Culture.\\" In Dark Fiber: Tracking Critical Internet Culture.

Gairich is a mountain in Scotland situated on the southern side of Loch Quoich between Glen Kingie and Glen Garry in the Lochaber district of the Highland Council Area, 25 kilometres north-northwest of Fort William.  Overview  With a height of 919 metres (3015 feet), Gairich qualifies as a Munro by just four metres. Despite its relatively low height the mountain is rough and quite isolated with a substantial prominence of 552 metresDatabase of British and Irish Hills. and is conspicuous in the view up Glen Garry. It is seen as a conical peak when viewed from the Loch Quoich dam (see picture). The mountain was initially named Scour Gairoch on the original 1891 list of MunrosThe Munros and Tops 1891-1997. and is still occasionally called this, however it is now referred to generally as Gairich which translates from the Gaelic as “roaring”The Munros Page 147 (Gives translation as “Roaring“). or Peak of Yelling”The High Mountains of Britain and Ireland Page 319 (Gives translation as \\"Peak of Yelling\\"). and is believed to refer to the roaring of stags in the rutting season.  Geography  Gairich has two notable corries on its slopes. Coire Liath lies on the northern flank of the mountain. It is a kilometre across and is rimmed by crags. It is drained by the Allt a' Choire Leith which flows northwards into Loch Quoich. These lower northern slopes of the mountain formerly had a right of way which went along the southern shore of Loch Quoich, this track was submerged and lost when the loch was dammed in 1957 and the water level was raised by 100 feet as part of the hydro-electric scheme in the Highlands.Hamish‘s Mountain Walk Pages 219 (Gives info on submerged path on south shore of loch). Lochan Doire Meall an Eilein, a small lake approximately 500 metres in length stands on the northern flanks of Gairich around the 400 metre contour. The eastern slopes of the mountain has the smaller Coire Thollaidh which also drains north into the loch. Gairich is made up of three distinct ridges, the NE and NW ridges form the flanks of Coire Liath and descend to Loch Quoich. Either of these ridges could be used for ascent by walkers approaching the mountain by canoe across the loch. The eastern ridge descends for four kilometres from the summit ending near the Quoich dam and is used in ascending the mountain from that direction. Although the mountain is seen as a conical peak when viewed from the Quoich dam this is quite misleading as the actual summit plateau extends westward for almost two kilometres culminating in the subsidiary top of Gairich Beag with a height of 730 metres before descending into the a' Mhaingir glen. Gairich is in fact the first peak in a chain of hills which extends westwards over the adjoining Munro of Sgurr Mòr to terminate at Sgurr na Cìche in the remote wilderness of Knoydart. The southern flank of the mountain descends steeply into the lonely Glen Kingie, this precipitous slope has a large impressive gully on it which is drained by the Allt am Fhamhair.Hamish‘s Mountain Walk Pages 219 (Gives info on gully on south slopes). Glen Kingie itself can be a difficult barrier when approaching Gairich from the south with the River Kingie being an impossible obstacle when it is in spate and needing wading at other times because of the absence of bridges. The Kinbreack bothy in Glen Kingie is a useful base for climbing the mountains in this area.  Ascents  The usual ascent of Gairich starts at the car park at the Loch Quoich damThe Munros Page 147 (Gives details of ascent from Quoich dam). at grid reference . From there the dam wall is crossed and a path is picked up which goes south for 2.5 kilometres to reach the lower part of the east ridge. It is then a five kilometre climb up the ridge to the highest point, crossing the subsidiary top of Bac nam Foid (584 metres) on the way. The final section to the summit is a steep climb with one tricky narrow bit. It is also possible to climb the mountain from the south, starting at the road end by Loch Arkaig at StrathanThe High Mountains of Britain and Ireland Page 171 (Gives details of route from Loch Arkaig). at grid reference and following an old right of way to Tomdoun in Glen Garry as far as the Kinbreack bothy in Glen Kingie. The best place to wade the Kingie is near the bothy, Gairich can then be ascended by its western flank passing over Gairich Beag to reach the summit.

Milun is the ninth lai in the collection known as the Lais of Marie de France. Like the other lais (lays) in this collection, Milun is written in the Anglo-Norman dialect of Old French, in couplets of eight syllables in length. The lais can be traced back to the 12th century. Plot summary Milun, a knight without equal who lives in southern Wales, falls in love with a beautiful noblewoman (a baron's daughter). They begin a secret affair and soon conceive a child. The noblewoman fears for her reputation because they are not married. She is able to hide the pregnancy. Once the child is born, she has him sent away to her sister in Northumbria along with precious silk, a ring, and a letter. Not knowing her love for Milun, the woman's father marries her off to another man. Unwilling to break contact, however, Milun sends messages to his lover by sending a swan with letters hidden in its feathers. This continues for many years, while their son grows up in the home of his aunt. The young man grows into a powerful knight, whose renown spreads throughout the kingdom, and one day he decides to attend a tournament at the Mont Saint-Michel. Hearing tales of this valiant knight, Milun also decides to attend the tournament, completely unaware that it is his son. Eventually, the father and son meet in battle, where the son is victorious. He knocks off Milun's helmet, and realizing that he is fighting an older gentleman, he approaches him to pay his respects. However, as he gets closer, Milun recognizes the ring on the young man's finger and realizes that this is his long-lost son. The two share a tearful reunion, and Milun tells his son the entire story of his conception. The young man determines that his only course of action is to return to his mother and kill her husband so that his parents can be reunited. They return to Wales, and when they arrive, they are greeted by a messenger who tells them that the lady's husband has died. Thanks to this coincidence, Milun marries his lady.\\"Milun,\\" Norton Anthology of English Literature , Stephen Greenblatt, General Editor. New York, 2012.

The publication of the International Marie de France Society is named Le Cygne, which is French for \\"swan\\". * The Lai of Milun focuses on the birth of an illegitimate child, much like the Lai of Yonec. * Bloch points out other elements such as imposition of a father's unhappy marital choice, the lady confined to a castle, the hiding of an illicit passion. * Some critics have suggested feminist readings of Marie de France's work, including the lai of Milun.

He was also vice-president of the Society for the Support of National Industry and Honorary Grand Master of the Grande Oriente do Brasil. He served on the founding board of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute and was its president from 1847-1875. Honours He was decorated with the Order of Christ and the Order of the Rose, as well as the Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword and the Legion of Honour. He was made viscount in 1854 and marquess in 1872. He was a privy councillor, gentleman of the bedchamber and knight of the Imperial Household.

Background It was redeveloped in the late 1990s, transforming it into a modern glass-covered building. It has been described as “posh and sleek”. In January 2008, Paragon was embarked on an $82 million facelift which included a $37 million land premium to expand its commercial space on the nearby space which was once a former site of The Promenade as its new wing, which saw the addition of three more floors of office and medical space as well as new retails stores. Led by the architecture firm DP Architects, the makeover was completed in December 2008. Paragon emerged with a contemporary facade. The renovation was also in step with the URA's call to building owners to create more interesting and unique building facades to enhance the vibrancy of Orchard Road. In January 2017, Forbes recognized Paragon as one of the top five shopping malls in Singapore. Stores Paragon is known for its cluster of flagship stores of international high fashion labels such as Tod's, Prada, Miu Miu, Jimmy Choo, Anteprima, Dunhill, Etro, Ermenegildo Zegna and Burberry. Gucci opened its flagship store with five storeys of shopfront presence on the facade in February 2010. Complementing fashion are accessories that include watches, pens and jewellery retailers such as Hublot, Cortina Watch, Larry Jewelry and Loang and Noi, among others, as well as crystal specialist Liuligongfang and handcrafted porcelain Lladró. Paragon's tenants include Metro departmental store, Toys \\"R\\" Us, Marks & Spencer and Paragon Market Place. There are several restaurants in the shopping centre, ranging from the moderately priced Thai Express to high-end Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck Restaurant, as well as the one-Michelin-starred Crystal Jade Golden Palace. Paragon Medical Paragon also houses a 20-storey medical and office tower atop the Paragon shopping podium.

The initiative began officially between 1988 and 1989 with the intention to involve the eventual microfilming of over 3 million endangered volumes.  Purpose  In the beginning half of the 20th century it became apparent that the use of acidic wood-pulp paper, common since the 1850s, was causing paper materials to slowly burn. This has been referred to as the slow fire. A statement submitted to the House of Representatives estimated that there were 80 million brittle books in North American libraries, 12 million of which were unique titles. As mass deacidification efforts proved costly and inconsistent, librarians and archivists began looking for more practical ways to preserve the intellectual content of the decaying material. Microfilm, one of the most stable and durable mediums around at the time, was decided to be the most reasonable alternative.  Timeline  *1987 - A subcommittee of the House of Representatives during the 100th Congress (1st session) addressed the problem of \\"brittle books in our nation's libraries.\\" *March 17, 1988 - Patricia Battin, president of the Commission on Preservation and Access (CPA), testified before the U.S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies (Committee on Appropriations). She proposed a collaborative approach to the preservation of the nation's brittle books and asked the House to increase federal funding for preservation microfilming. *October, 1988 - An appropriations bill for fiscal year 1989 gave the National Endowment for the Humanities $12.5 million. Eight million dollars of that sum went to instituting a twenty-year program for the microfilming of endangered volumes. *1995 - The program was assessed to be on schedule and 25% complete. *Roughly 50,000 brittle and endangered volumes are microfilmed each year. Important figures William Barrow was a pioneer conservator in the library science field. He connected the paper strength or lack thereof (brittle paper) to the acidity of the groundwood used to make wood pulp after the 1850s..The Book and Paper Annual vol.13 With his own observations of his collection and tests conducted, he announced to the library community that acid deterioration begins to show signs after 20,40 and 80 years.  Structure  As with other National Endowment for the Humanities programs, the Brittle Books Program is a partnership program, meaning that qualifying institutions must apply for grants in order to participate. Should the institution be accepted, they are required to share at least 33% of the program's costs. Unlike other National Endowment for the Humanities preservation funding initiatives, the Brittle Books program does require that an institution in each state must be awarded a grant. The projects are largely run at the state level with the National Endowment for the Humanities providing methodologies, assuring a standard level of quality, and connecting the efforts of the various institutions. To be awarded a grant as part of the Brittle Books Program, institutions were required to abide by five basic conditions: *1. That they abide by the national standard *2. That they create three copies of all material: a master negative, a print negative, and a service copy *3. That a record adhering to national standards be entered into a national bibliographic database *4. That interlibrary loan copies be readily available *5. That storage conditions meet that of the national standard  Preservation issues  =Deacidification= While there is a deacidificationMass deacidification method that can successfully lower the acidity in brittle books, many public libraries do not have the funding to implement standard programs to halt the deterioration taking place in these institutions. Some repositories have the resources to send books for a deacidification wash in stages. Deacidification washes are usually a viable option for most repositories as books can be sent in bulk; however, only books of excellent physical quality may be sent. The wash process is rather aggressive and any deformities in a book may cause damage to already brittle specimens. Therefore, libraries would have to first repair those books in less than desirable condition - specifically elements of the binding, leaf attachments, and text attachments - before deacidification. These extra conservation efforts would increase the costs of deacidification. =Paper splitting= Another option to preserve brittle books is to perform paper splitting.MDEP Paper Strengthening Pilot Program 2003-2005 (Preservation, Library of Congress) This process dissects a book by its leaf and text attachment and treats each sheet of paper individually. Supervised by a book conservator, a paper conservator, and a conservation specialist, pages are literally pulled apart - fronts from backs - and a piece of alkaline paper is placed in between. The acid pages are then sandwiched back together with a non-acid buffer between them to slow the deterioration process. However, only ZFB (the Zentrum für Bucherhaltung) offers this procedure (also called mechanical paper splitting). They claim the process is so refined, they have successfully split cigarette paper. Washes will de-acidify the paper though they will remain brittle; but paper splitting increases the strength and flexibility of the paper via the extra new sheet of buffered paper and the ZFB process includes de-acidification washes.Brückle, I. and Dambrogio, J.\\"Paper splitting: History and modern technology\\" \\"Journal of the American Institute for Conservation\\", 2000. Retrieved on 2008-02-06.Bansa, H. and Ishii, R. \\"The Effect of Different Strengthening Methods on Different Kinds of Paper\\". \\"Restaurator\\", 1997. Retrieved on 2008-02-06.Liers, L., Wächter, W., and Müller, G. \\"Results of the paper splitting process.\\" \\"Restaurator\\",1996. =Microform= Microform is a reasonable option for Brittle Book preservation mainly because microfilm can be usable for 500 years, so long as it is stored in proper conditions and a microfilm reader is accessible. Even microfiche is easier to store than microfilm, provided organizational practices prevent the divestment of sheets from their filing system. Despite its proven record of durability, microform is no longer a preferred method of digitization because it lacks the accessibility that modern electronic digitization provides. =Digitization= Digital conversion of physical items is the preferred method, despite an estimated five-year longevity for most computer files. As proper archival-quality digitization requires use of large, uncompressed TIFF files, storage can be a significant cost, especially for public libraries. Moreover, copyright law restrains the ability to digitize all brittle books. While the library is authorized to make a copy of a book it cannot obtain through reasonable means, having a digital copy offers the possibility of unauthorized distribution if circulated in this format.Copyright and Preservation-Brittle Books Preservation =Photocopies= Many repositories, such as the University of Kansas,KU Libraries: Brittle Books Program opt for preservation-quality photocopies. A list-servKU Libraries: Brittle Books Program is utilized for the posting of titles so a consortium of libraries can benefit from a reduced cost in replication so they may maintain their circulating collections. Maintained by OCLC, the submissions are processed at the OCLC Preservation Service Center and OCLC retains the digital copies produced as to defer any copyright issues away from the repositories subscribing to the service.  Future  As libraries move into the digital era, preservation practices attempt to move with them. Current and future projects in preserving brittle volumes are more likely to involve scanning and digitization than microfilming. A recent example of such a program is the Digitizing America's Imprints project at the Library of Congress which received a $2 million grant in 2007.

Biography Jerry Rivers was born in Miami, Florida. He played fiddle with the Drifting Cowboys, a band who will be forever associated with their \\"frontman\\", the legendary Hank Williams. Raised in Nashville, in a house that would later serve as an office for Atlantic Records, Jerry Rivers took up the fiddle as a teenager and was, by the mid-1940s, playing it semi- professionally whilst working during the day as a salesman for an electronic components company. He turned professional, briefly toured with the Short Brothers and then found himself back in Nashville working with Big Jeff Bess, husband of Hattie Louise \\"Tootsie\\" Bess, owner of the famous Tootsie's Orchid Lounge on Music City's Lower Broadway. It was whilst working with Bess that Rivers was first approached by Williams. Although Hank had performed with groups from the mid-1930s on, it was only following his successful early appearances on the Grand Ole Opry in 1949 that he began to see the merits of a permanent backing band. Despite Williams' status as a rising star, Rivers was not impressed with the financial terms on offer and initially declined. Later, encouraged by his friend, Opry guitarist Jack Boles, he had second thoughts and headed for the radio station WSM where he found his future boss at the shoe-shine stand. They briefly talked before Williams grabbed Rivers' instrument and began playing the fiddle standard \\"Sally Goodin\\". When he had finished he challenged the younger man to follow suit whilst he accompanied on guitar. As Rivers later remembered: \\"We must have played it for five minutes, then he set down his guitar and I set down the fiddle, and he said, \`Well, anyone (who) can play \\"Sally Goodin\\" better 'n me is a darn good fiddle player. You're hired.' \\" Rivers cut his first discs with Williams on 9 January 1950, in a session that produced classics like \\"Long Gone Lonesome Blues\\", \\"Why Don't You Love Me?\\", and \\"My Son Calls Another Man Daddy\\". Nicknamed \\"Burrhead\\" because of his haircuts, he performed on every major Williams session that followed. Fast becoming one of his best hunting and fishing buddies, Rivers and Williams struck up a friendship, Williams even naming Rivers his personal manager while in the state of Texas. At the suggestion of Williams' mentor, the producer and publisher Fred Rose, he adopted a characteristic double-stop style of bowing: playing the melody and harmony simultaneously on two strings. It was a style that Hank dismissed as \\"garden seed\\" fiddle, but one which served Rivers well on many of Williams' greatest recordings, among them: \\"Moanin' The Blues\\" (1950), \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" (1950), \\"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)\\" (1951), \\"Hey Good Lookin'\\" (1951) and \\"Jambalaya\\" (1952). In 1952, tired of Williams' constant drinking and unreliability, the Drifting Cowboys started backing other big-name artists such as Faron Young and Ray Price. They still played an occasional show with Williams, when he was sober enough, but the closeness of previous years was not renewed. On New Year's Day, 1953, Rivers was actually scheduled to play in the Canton, Ohio show with Price, while his friend, Helms, was to play with Williams. The weather was so bad, however, that Rivers was forced to turn back when he reached Louisville, Kentucky. He never made it to the show. Neither did Hank Williams. Following Williams' death in the early hours of New Year's Day 1953, Rivers and the other Drifting Cowboys had few problems finding work, making valuable contributions to the music of Ray Price and Ferlin Husky, Marty Robbins and, eventually, Hank Williams Jr. In the early 1960s, Rivers cut a now rare solo album for Starday, Fantastic Fiddlin' and Tall Tales which is now available on compact disc as \\"Stories and Great Fiddle Music As Played by Jerry Rivers http://www.stevehoffman.tv/forums/showthread.php?t=247401 Jerry Rivers - Stories and Great Fiddle Music As Played by Jerry Rivers) on which he both explains and demonstrates the evolution of various country fiddle styles, and in 1964 his biography of Williams, From Life To Legend, was published (revised edition 1980). In 1976, the Drifting Cowboys reformed for a series of radio shows with the country comic Whitey Ford and enjoyed renewed popularity, especially on the Opry stage and in Britain where they performed at the Wembley Festival. Together, they cut a series of albums: A Song For Us All (1979), A Tribute To Hank Williams (1980), Live! (1981) and Classic Instrumentals (1981), before largely retiring to enjoy their status as Nashville icons. In the 1990s, Rivers and Don Helms toured with Jett Williams, Hank Williams' daughter by Bobbie Jett. He also worked as an agent and talent scout for the powerhouse Buddy Lee Attractions. Rivers was, with steel guitarist Don Helms, bassist Hillous Butram and guitarist Bob McNett part of a quartet whose work with Williams has given them a special place in the affections of country music fans. That they largely stuck with the most troubled and behaviorally erratic figure in the genre's history is a tribute not only to their patience but also to the loyalty they felt towards the man they knew as \\"Bones\\". Rivers died on October 4, 1996, of cancer. Film depiction Rivers was portrayed by actor Casey Bond in the 2015 biopic film I Saw the Light.

This upheld the decision of Mocatta in the court below. Facts and legal processes The defendant entered the home of an 18-year-old woman and asked for sex. When she declined his advances, he stabbed her four times; the wound penetrated her lung which necessitated both a blood transfusion and surgery to save her life. After refusing treatment because of her religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness, she died. The prosecution conceded that she would not have died if she had received treatment. The prosecution did not challenge unrelated evidence that the defendant was suffering from diminished responsibility which reduced murder to manslaughter, decreasing the starting point for any sentencing. Examined in his case, counsel for the Crown accepted the refusal to have a blood transfusion was a cause of the death.http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1975/3.html The defence argued that the refusal to accept medical treatment broke the chain of causation (in modern comparative and ancient law in Latin this is called a novus actus interveniens) between the stabbing and her death. Appeal as to homicide on the basis of causation The defence and court system saw an appeal heard within 9 months, with its judgment pronounced a month later, and did not dispute the second-count wounding conviction (resulting from a separate charge). Lawton LJ (the most senior judge on the panel) ruled that, as a matter of public policy, \\"those who use violence on others must take their victims as they find them,\\" invoking the thin-skull rule. The defendant's conviction of manslaughter was upheld.

Merrian-Webster dictionary defines it as \\"a convert to Christianity who accepts baptism not on the basis of personal conviction but out of a desire for food, medical services, or other benefits\\" . Concerns have been expressed both by Christian missionaries and by those opposed to Christian missions that people in these situations are only nominally converting to Christianity in order to receive charity or material advancements. One of the earliest examples of this concept in English appeared in 1689 with the writings of William Dampier when he wrote regarding the French priests' effort to convert people of Tonkin that \\"alms of rice have converted more than their preaching.\\"Chapter XV This term and the topic were very extensively written about by Thomas Hale, Jr.. He introduced the topic in his first 1986 book Don't Let the Goats Eat the Loquat Trees and spoke and taught on best practices in missions summarizing his work in his 1995 book On Being a Missionary. The term has also been used pejoratively to describe conversions by missionaries who exploit poverty and famine, where food and other allurements are given in exchange for conversion. In Christian Witness in a Multi-Religious World: Recommendations for Conduct, a document issued by the World Council of Churches in 2011, one of the points raised states \\"If Christians engage in inappropriate methods of exercising mission by resorting to deception and coercive means, they betray the gospel and may cause suffering to others.\\" Principles 4 and 5 of this document outline that \\"Acts of service, such as providing education, health care, relief services and acts of justice and advocacy are an integral part of witnessing to the gospel. The exploitation of situations of poverty and need has no place in Christian outreach. Christians should denounce and refrain from offering all forms of allurements, including financial incentives and rewards, in their acts of service.\\" and \\"as they carry out these ministries, fully respecting human dignity and ensuring that the vulnerability of people and their need for healing are not exploited.\\" These points are seen as to prevent false conversions which produce \\"Rice Christians\\". The term \\"Rice Christians\\" appears in Harper Lee's book To Kill A Mockingbird, in Chapter 13. Scout's Aunt Alexandra uses the word referring to Missionary Society refreshments during \\"long reports on Rice Christians.\\" To Kill A Mockingbird was first published in 1960. An example of \\"Rice Christianity\\" was used in A.J. Cronin's novel The Keys to the Kingdom, about a Scottish priest who does missionary work in China. While the term is never used in print, the example is shown when the protagonist is hosted by a Chinese couple named Hosannah and Ferdinand Wang. Through getting to know his host couple, the protagonist sees they have little interest in aiding him in his missionary work and are mainly hosting him for the money they receive from his church in Scotland.

The sixth year graduate of the famous Whampoa Military Academy at the age of 19, Hu Kexian became a Lieutenant General at the age of 28 and was in charge of the only heavy artillery regiment (10th regiment/第十團重炮兵團長) of the ROC army during his time. His heavy artillery regiment played a major role during the Second Sino-Japanese war (1937–1945) such as the Battle of Shanghai because the artillery regiment was trained under the German Nazi instructors and possessed the most effective weaponry in both skill and technology for its time. The son of an ex-government official (華陽縣縣長) of the Qing Dynasty, Hu Kexian was sent away by his parents to study business in Chongqing when he was a teenager; However, Hu Kexian ran away en route to Chongqing and joined the Huangpu Army Academy in Nanjing. The young man had the ambition of helping Chiang Kai-shek to restore order to China during the period of chaos with warlords throughout the country. By the time Hu Kexian graduated the academy, the campaign against the warlords had already ended, but the invasion of the Japanese had just begun. Hu Kexian was very talented in Chinese calligraphy. During his trip to join the Huangpu Academy, Hu Kexian had run out of money by the time he reached Guangzhou, where the academy used to be before it relocated to Nanjing. Hu was able use his calligraphy skill to make some fast cash to help him reach the academy in Nanjing successfully. After the Chinese Civil War, Hu Kexian became the head of security in the southern region of Taiwan (南區警備司令) and often accompanied Chiang Kai-shek to patrol and inspect the cities in the region. Hu Kexian died in Tainan due to cerebral hemorrhage. He was survived by three sons: Hu Shaoning (胡紹寧), Hu Shaorong (胡紹蓉), and Hu Shaoyu (胡紹渝). His eldest son, Hu Shaoning, was the most trusted one and would often be called in by his father to consult on different matters. Military strategy During one of the battles in Yunnan, Hu Kexian's unit had the Japanese army surrounded and trapped in the caves. The Japanese refused to come out while they were being attacked by Hu's heavy artillery. In response, Hu ordered his troops to use the smaller artillery to fire at the Japanese, making the enemy believe Hu's unit had run out of ammunition for the heavy artillery. Unable to reach the caves with the smaller artillery, the Japanese came out of the caves and prepared for a full-scale flanking on Hu's unit. After tricking the Japanese out of their caves, Hu Kexian re-ordered his unit to blast the enemy again with the heavy artillery and successfully annihilated them.

He played Gaelic football with his local club Crossmaglen Rangers and with the Armagh senior inter-county team in the 1970s and 1980s. Awarded All Stars in 1977 and 1982, he is the former manager of Armagh's senior football team, and led them to the 2002 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship title, their first before retiring in July 2007 after the team lost to Derry.Setanta He currently manages Ulster and the Irish International Rules team. A biography of his story was published in 2011 called 'Joe Kernan:Without a Shadow of Doubt'. Early and private life Joe Kernan was born in Dublin, in 1954. The second son in a family of three boys and two girls, his father died when he was just 11 years old and his mother died in late 2007. Kernan was educated locally and later boarded in Omeath and then attended the Abbey Christian Brothers Grammar School in Newry. Following his secondary education there were few employment prospects in Northern Ireland and Kernan considered emigrating to Australia where three of his siblings had already gone. In the end he decided to stay in Crossmaglen and in the 1980s he ran a bar in the town. He closed the pub in the early 1990s and currently works as a self-employed estate agent and mortgage broker. In December 1976 Joe married Patricia Morgan, in 1983 the first of their five sons was born, they are Stephen, Aaron, Tony, Paul & Ross. The four eldest boys are well known due to their successes in football with Crossmaglen Rangers and they are on the Armagh panel. Playing career =Club= Kernan played his club football with the Crossmaglen Rangers team and, in time, would become one of the most celebrated players with the club. He won five senior county championship titles between 1971 and 1988. Kernan retired from club football in 1988. =Inter-county= Kernan made his senior Armagh playing debut in a McKenna Cup game against Donegal in 1971. It took until 1977 for Kernan to have his first major success when he won his first Ulster title. Armagh later played Dublin in the All-Ireland final, however, in spite of Kernan scoring two goals, he still ended up on the losing side. Kernan earned an All-Star award for his performances that year. In 1980 Kernan won another Ulster medal with Armagh, however, his side were later beaten by Roscommon in the All-Ireland semi-final. A third provincial medal was claimed by Kernan in 1982, however, Armagh fell at the All-Ireland semi-final stage once again. In spite of this he was still presented with a second All-Star award. Kernan continued playing until 1987 when he retired after an Ulster final defeat to Derry. It was his sixth provincial final appearance overall. Kernan also won two National Football League Division 2 in 1976 and 1979. Managerial career =Crossmaglen Rangers (1)= In 1993 Kernan became manager of Crossmaglen Rangers. At the time Crossmaglen football was at an all-time low. Three years later in 1996, after the club had won four under-21 county titles in-a-row, Kernan guided the senior side to a first county championship in 11 years. Crossmaglen went on to claim the Ulster club title before defeating Knockmore to win the 1997 All-Ireland club title. In 1997 and 1998 Kernan guided Crossmaglen to two further county titles. The latter win was later converted into a second set of Ulster and All-Ireland titles. In 1999 Cross captured a fourth county title in-a-row as well as a second successive Ulster title. On St. Patricks Day, 2000 Kernan's side went on to win a third All- Ireland title in four years. Following this victory Kernan decided to retire from club management. He would later return in 2013. =Armagh= In 1989 Kernan got a first taste of inter-county management when he served as assistant to the Armagh manager, Paddy Moriarty. After Armagh were beaten by the eventual Ulster champions in 1989, 1990 and 1991 Moriarty decided to resign as manager and Kernan also walked away. In November 2001, Kernan was appointed manager of the Armagh senior football team.Kernan calls it a day, Séamus Maloney, The Irish News, 19 July 2007, p. 56 No stone was left unturned in preparing the team. Eight months later Kernan's side later went on to win the 2002 Ulster title. This win allowed them to advance to an All-Ireland quarter-final meeting with Sligo, however, no Armagh team had won a championship game in Croke Park in twenty-five years. Kernan's side defeated Sligo after a replay before disposing of Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final. At half-time during that match Kernan pulled the first of two famous stunts designed to inspire the team. He produced the old Armagh jersey that he wore in the 1977 All-Ireland final, and told his players that this would be their reward. In the subsequent 2002 All-Ireland final, Kerry were leading Armagh at the interval. During his half-time speech he pulled the second of those famous stunts when he produced his runners-up plaque from the 1977 All-Ireland final and smashed it in the dressing room. Armagh later went on to defeat Kerry by a single point to win their first All-Ireland title ever. In the 2003 Championship Armagh reached the All-Ireland final once again, however this time they were beaten by Tyrone. Kernan's Armagh side recaptured the Ulster Senior Football Championship in 2004 against Donegal in the first ever Ulster final to be held at Croke Park. In 2005 he guided the county to their first ever National League title, before successfully defending the Ulster Championship against Tyrone. The following year Armagh became the first team since the 1959–1961 Down side to win the Ulster Championship three years in a row. In Kernan's five seasons in charge, Armagh played 36 Championship games and lost just seven of them, winning 23 and drawing six. The side never lost a Championship replay under him. His record as manager of Armagh is unequaled and he has confirmed his status as a legend as both a player and manager. =Ulster= In August 2008, Kernan was announced the new manager of Ulster for the Railway Cup campaign. He replaced Donegal man Brian McEniff who had held the role since 1982. =Galway= In September 2009, Kernan was announced as the new manager of the Galway senior football team. However, in August 2010, he resigned after a very unsuccessful year with the result of Galway getting knocked out of the championship early by being defeated by Wexford. =Crossmaglen Rangers (2)= On 27 March 2013, Kernan was reappointed manager of Crossmaglen Rangers. =Ireland= In late March 2015, Kernan was appointed manager of the Ireland international rules football team for the 2015 Series against Australia.

It stretches from north to south, across five counties and over one hundred municipalities. It follows the historic routes of the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad, Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Lehigh Navigation, Lehigh Canal, and the Delaware Canal, from Bristol (northeast of Philadelphia) to Wilkes-Barre in the northeastern part of the state. The backbone of the Corridor is the D & L Trail. The Corridor's mission is to preserve heritage and conserve green space for public use in Bucks, Northampton, Lehigh, Carbon, and Luzerne counties in Pennsylvania. It also operates Hugh Moore Historical Park & Museums, which includes the National Canal Museum.  Geography  The Corridor is a contiguous, five-county region in eastern Pennsylvania. It contains the counties of Luzerne, Lehigh, Carbon, Bucks, and Northampton. Major rivers include the Susquehanna, Delaware, and Lehigh. = Cities in the Corridor = *Allentown *Bethlehem *Easton *Jim Thorpe *White Haven *Wilkes-Barre *Bristol *Bensalem *Centre Bridge *Doylestown *Fallsington *Levittown *Lumberville *New Hope *Morrisville *Point Pleasant *Raubsville *Riegelsville *Upper Black Eddy *Uhlerstown *Washington Crossing *Yardley Activities The mission of the Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor is to enrich communities through actions and partnerships that conserve the resources, preserve the history, and enhance the quality of life. Today, the Corridor offers a broad range of experiences for visitors and residents such as hiking, boating, camping, biking, and fishing. The Delaware & Lehigh also operates the National Canal Museum in Easton, Pennsylvania, which includes the Emrick Technology Center, Locktender's House Museum and the canal boat ride, Josiah White II. Historically, the Corridor has been used to link people and communities, and this is still a prominent goal of the Corridor today. The entire trail is used to connect and promote the importance of this region. Each community has unique ecological attributes and a diversified history to conserve. The Corridor preserves these features and offers an opportunity to educate and enjoy nature. = D&L; Trail = D&L; Trail along the Delaware CanalThe D&L; Trail is a multi-use trail. The trail incorporates rail trails, rails with trails, share-the-road sections, and canal towpaths. The trail follows the route that anthracite coal took from mine to market. It winds through northern mountains and along the banks of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers through northeast Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Valley, and Bucks County. The D&L; Trail passes through towns, industrial powerhouses, and along remnants of the Lehigh and Delaware canals. This earthen path exposes walkers, hikers, bicyclists, and others to Pennsylvania wildflowers, waterfalls, and wildlife. Currently, of the trail are completed. The southern terminus of the trail is in Bristol, Bucks County. The northern terminus of the trail is in Mountain Top, Luzerne County. Work has begun on extending the trail from Mountain Top—to—Wilkes Barre at Seven Tubs Natural Area. From Mountain Top to White Haven, the trail is locally known as the Black Diamond Trail. From White Haven to Jim Thorpe, the trail is locally known as the Lehigh Gorge Trail, a section that parallels the Lehigh River and the valley of the Lehigh Gorge at Lehigh Gorge State Park. From Easton to Bristol, the trail is known as the Delaware Canal towpath, a section that passes entirely through Delaware Canal State Park. The Delaware Canal towpath is a National Recreation Trail. The highest point on the trail is in Mountain Top; the lowest point is in Bristol. = Recreation = The Corridor contains more than of public lands for outdoor recreation, including many state, county, and local parks. *Beltzville State Park *Delaware Canal State Park *Frances Slocum State Park *Hickory Run State Park *Jacobsburg State Park *Lehigh Gorge State Park *Moon Lake Park *Nescopeck State Park *Neshaminy State Park *Ricketts Glen State Park *Tyler State Park *Washington Crossing Historic Park =Historical appreciation= The Corridor includes hundreds of historical sites related to a variety of subjects including: social development of young America (Leni Lenape) settlements, the anthracite coal mining era (the Molly Maguires labor movement), the Industrial Revolution (Bethlehem Steel), the development of systematic canals (the Lehigh Navigation, Lehigh and Delaware Canals), the development of rail transportation (Lehigh Valley Railroad), and the evolution of natural conservation (John J. Audubon and Bucks County conservation movement). It also features sites that can be interpreted to represent the transforming principles that became the foundation of the American Constitution — religious freedom, mutual responsibility between government and the people, and equality. In 2017, the D&L; completed a merger with the National Canal Museum, combining the reaches of both the museum and the D&L; Trail. The Delaware & Lehigh now operates the museum and works to provide information on the history, science, and technology of canal construction and navigation. They manage a complete collection and archive of important artifacts of both the canal era and the industrial revolution. Through this merger, the D&L; deepens one of their central missions as an organization: to preserve the cultural heritage of the Delaware and Lehigh canals. They plan to create traveling exhibits to take the National Canal Museum to communities along the Corridor and further this historical appreciation component. History = Pre- European trading routes = The Corridor has long been a busy crossroads. Native American tribes such as the Susquehannock, Iroquois, Leni Lenape, and others frequently traveled through the northern region. The Delaware Canal parallels old trading routes. Many original Native American villages that developed here in the wilds of Pennsylvania drew European settlers in search of opportunity. = 18th - 20th centuries: Coal mining era = Weigh lock with scales to determine tolls, 1873In 1791, Philip Grinder found anthracite coal in what is now Summit Hill, Carbon County, PA. Coal helped the region develop and contributed to America's iron and steel industries. The anthracite coal in the region is known as \\"stone coal\\" because of its rock-like hardness. Anthracite is created over millions of years as countless layers of sediment compress plant debris from swamps until it becomes hard. The Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor follows the route stone coal took from mine to market, winding through northern mountains and along the banks of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers.Shealey, pp. 5-6. Locktender's House and Guard Lock 8 In the early to mid-1800s, a lengthy network of locks, canals, and towpaths was built to ship anthracite, further aiding the mining industry's growth. The Lehigh Canal system generated a great deal of industrial development in the form of mining and the accompanying infrastructure. It gave rise to many towns and offshoot businesses, such as timber cutting, sawmills, steel mills, tanneries, etc. The Delaware Canal, on the other hand, was a means of shipping goods and establishing commerce. It supplemented existing overland routes resulting in the lack of an industrial boom along this route. However, the Lehigh and Delaware Canals merged to create part of a grand transportation systems stretching from the Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean. In 1862 a massive flood, which destroyed dams, locks, canal boats, and villages, helped to shift the shipping of anthracite coal towards the railroads. Much like the canals, railroads helped to transport goods and contribute to the development of the region. Asa Packer's Lehigh Valley Railroad, which ran from Mauch Chunk to Easton and on to New York City, was the first rail line to have a significant impact. The Lehigh & Susquehanna Railroad, Reading Railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad also moved into the area to create competition for the shipping of coal and goods.Shealey, pp. 10-11. The canals and railroads that serve as the Corridor's backbone once transported coal, lumber, slate, iron, cement, and steel from mountain to market, fueling the Industrial Revolution and supplying downstream industries for more than a century. Of all the products and businesses born out of the coal and transportation connection, none were as significant as Bethlehem Steel, locally known as \\"The Steel.\\" =A National Heritage Area= A view of the Delaware Canal, with the towpath at left and the rail in the background In 1988, U.S. Congress designated the Corridor as nationally significant, in recognition of its nine National Historic Landmarks, six National Recreation Trails, two National Natural Landmarks and hundreds of sites listed in the National Register of Historic Places. A National Heritage Area is a region that has been recognized by the United States Congress for its unique qualities and resources. It is a place where a combination of natural, cultural, historic, and recreational resources have shaped a cohesive, nationally distinctive landscape. The Corridor is one of forty-nine federally recognized National Heritage Ages. Heritage areas allow local communities to cooperate on efforts to preserve the resources that are important to them. This partnership approach to heritage development allows collaboration around a theme, industry, and/or geographical feature that influenced the region's culture and history. This strategy encourages individuals and agencies to prioritized programs and projects that recognize, preserve, and celebrate many of America's defining landscapes. = D&L; Trail takes shape = In 2013, work was completed on 10 miles of trail from White Haven to Mountain Top. This section of the trail is locally known as the Black Diamond Trail. This is the first trail section that leaves the Lehigh River; it replaces abandoned rail beds. A trailhead and parking lot near Mountain Top were also completed. The trailhead is located on land owned by the PA DCNR Bureau of Foresty and the PA Game Commission. Funding was made possible by a $1.2m grant from the Federal Highway Administration through PennDOT. Gaps in the trail were also filled. A gap was filled at the crossing of State Route 13 in Levittown. Another gap was filled between Riverview Park in Palmer Township and Hugh Moore Park in Easton. = Merger with the National Canal Museum = In 2013, the Delaware & Lehigh National Heritage Corridor began operating the National Canal Museum under a management agreement. This marked the beginning of a three-year transition in which the two organizations would become one. The transition allowed the D&L; to integrate the management, finance, marketing, and development functions of the two organizations. The merger of the two in 2017 culminated this transition period. The D&L; is the surviving entity under which the enterprises will operate. The museum, along with the other operations of Hugh Moore Historical Park & Museums, is now the Signature Program of the D&L.; It is located in the Emrick Technology Center in Easton, Pennsylvania's Hugh Moore Park.  Affiliations  The Delaware & Lehigh National Heritage Corridor was recognized as an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution in 2017. It is the first National Heritage Area to be recognized as a Smithsonian Affiliate.

In the view of historian Wallace Notestein, Chamberlain's letters \\"constitute the first considerable body of letters in English history and literature that the modern reader can easily follow\\".Notestein, 29. They are an essential source for scholars who study the period.Thomson, vii, xi. • \\"It is, in fact, just about impossible to write about any aspect of the Jacobean period without quoting Chamberlain at least once.\\" Lee, 3. Life Chamberlain's father was a successful ironmonger, who left him enough money to live on for the rest of his life without needing to earn a living.Richard Chamberlain was \\"one of those capable tradesmen who shared in the abundance of Tudor Times\\". He became Sheriff of London and twice Master of the Worshipful Company of Ironmongers. His wife, Anne, was herself the daughter of an ironmonger and alderman. Notestein, 34–35. Though unambitious for himself, Chamberlain used his network of friends in high places to assist the career of Dudley Carleton, who rose from a minor position in the diplomatic service to become Secretary of State shortly after Chamberlain's death. Carleton preserved the long correspondence between himself and Chamberlain, which contains the majority of Chamberlain's surviving letters. Chamberlain maintained a similar correspondence with Sir Ralph Winwood, for many years ambassador at The Hague, and he presumably sent many other letters to his friends.Thomson, 44. Chamberlain wrote at least one long letter a week. His purpose was more than social; it was to provide his friends, posted abroad in foreign embassies and out of touch with the London scene, with useful and reliable information about the events and issues of the day. Chamberlain would walk daily to St Paul's Cathedral to gather the latest news on the London grapevine and then report it to his correspondents as accurately and objectively as possible, including public and private opinion on the value of the information. Chamberlain is a particularly valuable source for contemporary opinion on King James I, for information about the royal family and the court, and for details of English trading activities in the earliest days of empire.Thomson, xi. Chamberlain is valued not just as a commentator but as a writer. Historian A. L. Rowse has called him \\"the best letter writer of his time\\".Lee, 3. Chamberlain takes care to observe without intruding his own opinions; though his disapproval of the laxity of the day is apparent, he does not waste words on moral indignation.Notestein, 113. He entertains his correspondents by leavening factual information with humour and vivid details, and includes lighter topics and anecdotes to keep the reader's interest. In the view of scholar Maurice Lee, Jr., the letters that passed between John Chamberlain and Dudley Carleton are \\"the most interesting private correspondence of Jacobean England\\".Lee, 4. Character Chamberlain's letters provide a portrait of a typical London gentleman of late Elizabethan and Jacobean times, moderate in politics and religion.Chamberlain was a Protestant but distrusted religiosity and intolerance, whether Puritan or Catholic. He was pessimistic when Prince Charles ventured to Spain in 1622 to woo the Spanish Infanta, Maria, and relieved when the mission failed. Notestein, 96–97. In politics, Chamberlain came gradually to sense evil days ahead. He saw the king losing ground for lack of officers in parliament and noted in 1624 that constituents had begun to choose their own representatives rather than accept the government placemen. Notestein, 100–101. Chamberlain emerges from his letters as a kind man and a considerate friend, who preferred a peaceful life and commented on the contemporary world as an onlooker. Though he willingly sought career openings for his friends, he was uninterested in office or financial gain for himself and lived the life of a quiet, even timid bachelor. As he once wrote: \\"I am past all ambition, and wish nor seek nothing but how to live suaviter and in plenty\\".Thomson, viii. This detached approach lends an objective quality to Chamberlain's letters. As a conscientious correspondent, he took pains to get his facts right. He saw through pretence and delusions but was never cynical or indignant. His generosity as a man is reflected in the fairness of outlook that pervades his letters. Just as his friends confided and trusted in him, often with important secrets, historians have trusted his information and insights into the Jacobean scene.Thomson, viii. Historian Alan Stewart calls Chamberlain, \\"a notable barometer of public opinion\\".Stewart 204. Chamberlain certainly had personal shortcomings, of which he was fully aware, but they are not such as to affect the quality of his letters. He was naturally inquisitive and a gossip, qualities that served as an asset to him as a letter writer. He had been a sickly and delicate child; and although he attended both Cambridge University and the Inns of Court, he never took his degree or qualified as a lawyer.Thomson, x. Wallace Notestein, who included a long essay on Chamberlain in his Four Worthies (1956), described him as \\"wanting in initiative\\".Notestein, 55. He always lived in the households of friends and relatives; on the one occasion he attempted to run his own establishment, it proved too much for him. He was also timid in love; and though hints that he considered marriage creep into his letters now and then,Chamberlain's friends were still trying to marry him off at the age of fifty. Sir Rowland Lytton wrote to him in 1605: \\"I am not satisfied with your answer about the widow...Repent in time and forsake the solitary eagle's life, go pair with the dove, and send me a new pair of gloves, and if, upon a twelve month's trial you disallow my counsel I will fetch for you ten flitches of bacon from Dunmow\\". Notestein, 53. nothing came of these opportunities. Editor Norman McClure suggests that Chamberlain may at one time have considered marrying Dudley Carleton's sister Alice.Notestein, 51. In his will, among many generous gifts to his friends, he made a sizeable bequest to Alice,He left her a lump sum of £600, plus £80 per annum. Notestein, 56. explaining: \\"This I do, in regard of the sincere goodwill and honest affection I bear her, and of the true and long-continued friendship between us, and for a testimony of that further good I had intended her, if God had given me means\\".Thomson, x. Friends William Gilbert, natural philosopher, in whose house Chamberlain lodged Chamberlain acquired an interesting group of friends, mainly drawn from the middle ranks of society, with a background either in business or in the lesser country gentry.Thomson, ix. These included Ralph Winwood and Dudley Carleton, who both rose to become secretaries of state, the latter after Chamberlain's death. Such men saw themselves as members of a professional civil-servant class rather than as courtiers. Winwood, like Carleton, began as a diplomat, and Chamberlain's letters regularly report on his chances of becoming secretary of state, to which office Winwood was finally appointed in March 1614. Chamberlain remained close friends with Winwood during his secretaryship and often stayed at Winwood's country seat, Ditton Park: the information he retails in his letters clearly owes much to this friendship.Winwood speaks in a letter of Chamberlain \\"whom I do freely communicate all I know of worth and importance\\". Notestein, 84. Other notable friends of Chamberlain were Henry Wotton, himself an important letter writer;Wotton made the famous remark that an ambassador is an honest man sent to lie abroad for the good of his country. Chamberlain codenamed him \\"Signor Fabritio\\". Notestein, 87. Thomas Bodley, who founded the Bodleian library in Oxford; the bishop and scholar Lancelot Andrewes; and the historian William Camden. Chamberlain was constantly in demand as a house guest.Notestein, 58. In the summer, he would leave London, \\"this misty and unsavoury town\\", and embark on what he called his merry \\"progresses\\", staying at various country houses, for example with the Fanshawes at Ware, the Wallops at Farleigh, or the Lyttons at Knebworth.Notestein, 56–60, 105. For a time, Chamberlain lodged in the household of the natural philosopher and physician William Gilbert, whom he may have met at Cambridge University.Thomson, ix. Sir Henry Wotton by Michiel van Mierevelt Such a combination of friends and contacts enabled Chamberlain to report the main events of the day and to catch the mood of the hour. Drawing on these personal sources of information, as well as his contacts at St Paul's, Chamberlain provided his correspondents with information about key figures in England, including Walter Raleigh; the chancellor Robert Cecil; the chancellor and philosopher Francis Bacon; the king's favourite Robert Carr, and his notorious wife Frances. Chamberlain knew many people, and those he did not know, friends and contacts could tell him about. Chamberlain's letters shed light on the main events affecting the country during his adult life: the rebellion of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex; the accession of King James; the Gunpowder Plot; the Thomas Overbury case; the rise of King James's final favourite George Villiers; and the Spanish Match.Thomson, ix. Chamberlain also wrote about some of the leading artists and writers of the day, including the poet and clergyman John Donne, the architect and designer of masques Inigo Jones, and the playwright and poet Ben Jonson.Notestein, 30. If he knew William Shakespeare, however, he never mentioned himNotestein, 38n.—he does not appear to have been a theatregoer. In 1614, he wrote of the new Globe Theatre: \\"I hear much speech of this new playhouse, which is said to be the fairest that ever was in England, so that if I live but seven years longer I may chance make a journey to see it\\".Letter of 30 June 1614. Thomson, 157. Dudley Carleton Sir Dudley Carleton, by Michiel van Mierevelt, 1628 Chamberlain's major correspondent was Dudley Carleton, whose mother's sister was the wife of Chamberlain's nephew Thomas Stukely. When the correspondence began in the mid 1570s, Carleton was a young man, about twenty years younger than Chamberlain, urgently seeking a career. Chamberlain, through his friendship with Winwood, helped Carleton secure his first job, in the English embassy in Paris.Notestein, 44. By the time of Chamberlain's death, the upwardly mobile Carleton was a highly placed diplomat, on the brink of becoming secretary of state. However, he himself had only four years to live. Scholars have Carleton, who was \\"a magpie about his papers\\", to thank for the legacy of his vast correspondence, which provides a key resource for the period.The letters are held in the British National Archives. Lee, 4. On occasion, he confided diplomatic secrets to Chamberlain, safe in the knowledge of his friend's discretion.Notestein, 46–47. Chamberlain not only wrote letters to Carleton but sometimes performed errands on his behalf that brought him into contact with important political figures. Immediately after the Gunpowder plot of 1605, Carleton, who had been a secretary to Henry Percy, one of the plotters, was briefly confined and found himself unemployable. Chamberlain worked hard to bring Carleton back into favour, for example calling upon Sir Walter Cope, a friend of Cecil's whom Chamberlain dubbed \\"the idle oracle of the Strand\\".Notestein, 43. Carleton finally found work abroad. Other errands performed by Chamberlain on his behalf included paying his bills, taking gifts to ladies, and passing messages to his political contacts. Carleton often sought Chamberlain's advice about both political and personal matters: Carleton's usual prescription was patience. \\"To tell you truly,\\" he once admitted, \\"methinks we are like physicians that consult of a patient without feeling any part of his pain, and finding the disease somewhat difficult, apply no other remedy but good words and good wishes, and make him believe that time and good diet will cure it alone\\".Notestein, 45. On another occasion, he advised Carleton: \\"You need not take things so to heart, for such matters are no longer thought on than they are in speech, and therefore to mention them is to revive them, and the best means to have them forgotten is to forget first and bury all in silence, for good words and bad words pass away like water that runs apace\\". Notestein, 47. Carleton always appreciated Chamberlain's friendship and support.\\"I must [page torn] you to be the first which set me going in this course and have seen, guided, and upheld me by your good counsels and encouragements, when I have often been sinking for want of breath and giving over in plain field\\". Carleton to Chamberlain. Notestein, 45. Though Carleton's letters are not generally considered the equal of Chamberlain's in quality, his editor, Maurice Lee Jr., calls them \\"every bit as clear and polished\\".Lee, 7. News gatherer View of London with Old St. Paul's Cathedral, where Chamberlain gathered his news. The great length of the nave earned it the name \\"Paul's walk\\". Chamberlain was particularly useful to Carleton as a source of London news. Chamberlain's main purpose in his letters was to relate news of events in the capital to his correspondents, who were often abroad. Sir Dudley Carleton, for example, spent most of his political career at Venice or the Hague. Chamberlain proved the perfect source for Carleton and others because of his passion for news.Thomson, viii. Every day he walked to St Paul's Cathedral to hear the latest on the grapevine, from the \\"news-mongers\\", as they were called.Notestein, 31. At that time, the aisles and nave of the cathedral, known as Paul's walk, were a meeting place for those wishing to keep in touch with current events,According to Francis Osborne (1593–1656): \\"It was the fashion of those times...for the principal gentry, lords, courtiers, and men of all professions not merely mechanic, to meet in Paul's Church by eleven and walk in the middle aisle till twelve, and after dinner from three to six, during which times some discoursed on business, others of news\\". Thomson, 1. and Chamberlain proved adept at pumping people there for news of politics, war, court matters and trials.Thomson, viii. As well as those who walked St Paul's for news, the cathedral and its surrounds bristled with beggars, hawkers, and sellers of pamphlets, proclamations and booksThe cathedral had fallen into disrepair after the Reformation. To his bemusement, Chamberlain was made a member of the commission to undertake its repair. \\"I know not how I came in,\\" he wrote, \\"unless it be for my love of the place\\". Notestein, 106. Despite their serious purpose, Chamberlain lightened his letters with news of more trivial and entertaining events, such as a long- distance race from St Albans to Clerkenwell between two royal footmen and the antics of a man and his horse on the roof of St Paul's.Chamberlain, 106. King James and the court Frances Howard, Countess of Essex, by William Larkin Though Chamberlain circulated among members of the upper gentry, he was never close to court circles, nor did he wish to be.When court company was expected at Ware Park, he could not get away quick enough. Notestein, 61. In Notestein's words, \\"The reader of Chamberlain gains little respect for the Court of James I\\".Notestein, 89. Chamberlain's letters give well-informed reports on the greatest scandal of James's reign, the divorce and later conviction for murder of Frances Howard, Countess of Essex. Even before the countess's divorce from the Earl of Essex to marry Robert Carr, Viscount Rochester, the king's favourite, Chamberlain reported that the countess had approached a \\"wise woman\\" to help her do away with her husband.Letter of 29 April 1613. Notestein, 90. • Thomson, 112–113. On 14 October 1613, he noted both the divorce of the Essexes and the death of Robert Carr's friend Thomas Overbury in the Tower of London: \\"The foulness of his corpse gave suspicion and leaves aspersion that he should die of the pox or somewhat worse\\".Thomson, 115–116. Frances Howard married Robert Carr shortly after her divorce, with the king's blessing, the pair becoming the Duke and Duchess of Somerset. It emerged in 1615, however, that Overbury had been poisoned, and in 1616 the couple were found guilty of conspiring in his murder and locked in the Tower. Historians often quote Chamberlain's letters as a source for these events. His tone is one of shame and disgust at the court, but he reports the facts objectively, without gloating at the demise of the Somersets.Notestein, 92. In an age when spies were everywhere and letters insecure in transit, Chamberlain was discreet in his comments about King James, the Scottish king who inherited the throne from Elizabeth I of England in 1603. However, it becomes clear from his letters that Chamberlain was not impressed by James.Notestein, 73. \\"He forgets not business,\\" he wrote, \\"but he hath found the art of frustrating men's expectations and holding them in suspense\\".Thomson, viii–ix. Chamberlain affords us more glimpses of James's character than any other contemporary source; his letters provide an insight into how people of his class viewed the monarch and the court.Notestein, 65. Despite Chamberlain's disapproval of James, nowhere does he report the clumsy and gross figure depicted later in the seventeenth century by anti-Stuart historians, such as Anthony Weldon; nor does he ever imply that James's love for his male favourites was homosexual, though this may have been through prudence.Notestein, 70. Rather, he reports James's egoism, imperiousness, and lack of judgement. He tells us, for example, that during a sermon by the Bishop of London, James began interrupting so loudly that the Bishop could not continue; and when courtiers told James it was not the fashion to have a play on Christmas night, he retorted: \\"I will make it a fashion\\".Notestein, 66. Chamberlain also noted the officiousness of James, who liked to take a personal interest in scandals and court cases and was forever throwing people in the tower for speaking out of order. \\"I should rather wish him, \\" wrote Chamberlain, \\"to contemn these barking whelps and all their bawlings than to trouble himself with them, and bring these things to scanning, for it breeds but more speech, and to see silly men so severely censured begets commiseration\\".Notestein, 67. Chamberlain also provides valuable details of the king's habits. He reports, for example, that even when ill, James maintained his interest in country sports: \\"He is so desirous to see certain hawks fly, that he would not be stayed\\"; if he could not hunt, he would have his deer \\"brought to make a muster before him\\".Notestein, 70. Chamberlain regarded James as extravagant, and a poor judge of men. In particular, he frowns at James's tendency to give away royal bounty and crown lands to his favourites when he was often unable to pay government officials.Notestein, 68. Chamberlain does not seem to admire any of the Howard family who came to power after the death of Robert Cecil in 1612,For example, Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, and Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk. Notestein, 68. nor James's favourites Robert Carr, Duke of Somerset, and George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham.Notestein, 68. Style Chamberlain's style is sober and objective, illuminated by an eye for the precise detail.\\"I am well acquainted,\\" wrote Chamberlain's friend Powle, \\"how much particular circumstances do delight you\\". Notestein, 32. The elements of this style are a sometimes artful, sometimes natural, blending of public and private information, of the serious and trivial, reported with care and exactitude and spiced with brisk remarks of his own.Thomson, xii. He explains and comments on his information, which he lays out as clearly as possible in a logical sequence, adding his own estimations of the value of the information and opinions he reports.Notestein, 32. His sentences are obviously crafted with care.Notestein, 115. Chamberlain's letters are those of an educated and cultivated man, who could quote French, Italian and Spanish, and who was familiar with old English and classical literature.Notestein, 33. Sometimes his humour is formulaic, however, and he was not above sending the same letter to two different correspondents. His figures of speech are not his own invention but taken from general use, often drawing on images of hunting, falconry, horseriding, farming, and seafaring.Nearly all his figures of speech may be found in the plays of the day; for example, his image \\"to lead you away with the lapwing from finding his nest\\" was also used by the playwright John Ford. Notestein, 113. Chamberlain's style remains constant through the decades of his correspondence.Thomson, 1. Later years and death Chamberlain's letters chart a change in the country's mood during the later years of his life. After Queen Elizabeth died, Chamberlain had drawn confidence from the continuance in office of Elizabeth's head-of-government Robert Cecil, whom he called \\"the great little lord\\".Notestein, 41. After Cecil's death in 1612, a certain disillusionment tinges Chamberlain's view of the world, along with a nostalgia for the good old days. In this, he reflected a shift in public opinion noted by historians.Somerset, 726. • Strong, 164. Even in extreme old age, Chamberlain went on writing letters, though many of his correspondents had died and he was sometimes tempted to give up.Dudley Carleton's son reported to his father, \\"He maketh doubt whether he shall not give over writing altogether\\". Notestein, 118. When on one occasion he forgot to give Carleton a certain item of news, he remarked, \\"Whether it be that continual bad tidings hath taken away my taste, or that infirmity of age grows fast upon me, and makes me not regard how the world goes, seeing I am like to have so little part in it, for about the middle of the month I began to be septuagenarius\\".Notestein, 117. In his later days, Chamberlain became less inclined to venture abroad. He was also troubled by lawsuits after the death of his brother Richard left him chief heir and executor. \\"Now am I left alone of all my father's children, omnes composui, the last of eight brothers and sisters, and left to a troubled estate, not knowing how to wrestle with suits and law business and such tempestuous courses after so much tranquillity as I have hitherto lived in.\\"Notestein, 117. Chamberlain, however, enjoyed reasonable health in his old age and continued to dodge London's epidemics and plague, though the cold was an increasing trouble to him. No letters from Chamberlain to Carleton survive after the latter's return to England in 1626.Notestein, 118. Chamberlain signed his will on 18 June 1627, nine months before his death. He left gifts to charities, to poor prisoners, and to the inmates of Bedlam, as well as to many family members and friends, including Alice Carleton. He asked to be buried \\"with as little trouble and charge as may be answerable to the still and quiet course I have always thought to follow in my life-time\\".Notestein, 119.

The film was directed by Delbert Mann from a screenplay by O'Neill and Irwin Shaw. The cast included Sophia Loren as Abbie (known as Anna in the film), Anthony Perkins as Eben, Burl Ives as Ephraim, Frank Overton as Simeon, and Pernell Roberts as Peter. The film was nominated for Best Black and White Cinematography (Daniel L. Fapp) at the Academy Awards and Laurel Awards in 1959. It was also entered into the 1958 Cannes Film Festival. Story Widower Ephraim Cabot, a greedy New England farmer, who has overworked two wives to their graves, works his three sons from the two women as slaves. The farm's land originally belonged to the second wife, and before her death she pleads with Eben, the youngest son, to take the farm from the old man as his birthright. Eben buys out his half- brothers' shares of the farm with money stolen from his father, and Peter and Simeon head off to California to seek their fortune. Ephraim announces that his desire is for the farm to not be left to anyone, but rather burned to the ground upon his death. Later, Ephraim returns with a new wife, a beautiful and headstrong woman from Italy, Anna, who enters into an adulterous affair with Eben. Soon after, Anna bears Eben's child, but lets Ephraim believe that the child is his, with the old man's assurance that the farm shall be willed to her. The proud Ephraim is oblivious to his neighbors' open mocking of him as a cuckold. Eben and Anna argue and in a fit of jealousy because of comments from his father, Eben tells Anna he wishes the baby were dead and desires to never see Anna again. Madly in love with Eben and fearful of losing him because of the argument, Anna kills the infant, thinking this will prove to Eben her commitment to him. An enraged and distraught Eben threatens to tell the sheriff what she has done and departs. Prior to the sheriff's arrival, Eben returns to the farm and admits to Anna the depths of his love for her and confesses his own role in the infanticide. The old man condemns them both, calls out God, and is content that the farm will not fall into anyone's hands. The sheriff comments to his deputy that he wishes he could possess such a special farm as Ephraim's and then removes the two lovers to jail.

Published in London, it is among the early slave narratives written by slaves who gained freedom before the American Civil War and emancipation.Bayley 1825, p. 1.Dalleo 1997, p. 1. Bayley was born into slavery in Delaware. After escaping and being recaptured, he later bought his freedom, and that of his wife and children. He worked as a farmer and at a sawmill. In their later years, he and his wife emigrated in 1827 to the new colony of Liberia, where he worked as a missionary and farmer. His short book about the colony was published in Delaware in 1833. From slavery to freedom Bayley is believed to have been born about 1772 into slavery in Kent County, in what is now the state of Delaware). As was the case with many African Americans who lived in the United States during the 19th century, neither his birth nor death were recorded. Scholars such as Henry Louis Gates, Jr. have made rough estimates of Bayley's birth and death years based on his autobiography and related materials. Bayley learned that his maternal grandmother was born in Guinea, where she was captured at the age of eleven, sold into slavery, and transported to the English colonies in North America in 1690. She had fifteen children in total.Bayley (1825), p. 38. Bayley's mother had a total of thirteen children, while held by the same family. When a daughter of the family married a man from Delaware, she took Bayley's mother and father Abner, and the rest of the family with her to Delaware. After some time, they moved back to Virginia, and Bayley's family was widely dispersed in sales, with his father, sister Margaret, and brother Abner taken to Long Island in the West Indies and sold to Abner Stephen.Bayley (1825), pp. 38-39. His mother escaped with a young son and finally reached New Jersey. It was eighteen years before Bayley saw her again, after he had gained his own freedom.Bayley (1825), p. 39. Bayley was held in Delaware and trained as a cooper. Although the state legislature had passed a law forbidding the sale of slaves in Delaware to other states,James E. Newton, \\"BLACK AMERICANS IN DELAWARE: AN OVERVIEW\\", A HISTORY OF AFRICAN AMERICANS OF DELAWARE AND MARYLAND'S EASTERN SHORE, ed. Carole Marks, University of Delaware, 1997, Quote: ...state law forbade the sale of slaves out of state. Thus, slave owners could not benefit from breeding slaves as in a state like Virginia.\\" Note: Full text online in 1799 Bayley was sold as a young man to a man from Virginia. Bayley had already, since slaves could not marry, informally married Thamar, an enslaved woman on another Delaware plantation, and they had a nine- month-old son. His new owner took him to Virginia, but Bayley escaped as he was being transported there. He returned to Delaware, where he was briefly reunited with his wife, but knew he could not stay.Bayley 1825, p. 6.Newton 1997, p. 1. He moved on to Dover and then to Camden, Delaware. After a time, his owner recaptured him.Bayley 1825, p. 17. Bayley sued in a Delaware court for his freedom, saying that he had been illegally sold out of state. While the case was in court, his master agreed to let Bayley buy his freedom for $80.Bayley (1825), p. 18. As noted, his wife Thamar and their infant daughter Margaret were owned by another Delaware planter.Bayley (1825), p. 44 For names of wife and child, Quote: \\"Thus ends the account of Margaret Bayley, daughter of Solomon and Thamar Bayley, who departed this life the 26th of the 3rd month, 1821, aged twenty-three years, eleven months, and twenty-eight days.\\" Bayley first \\"hired out\\" his wife (with their child) from her master, paying for her time in order to keep her with him. He worked to save money to buy her outright; and he paid her master about $103 dollars.Bayley 1825, p. 27. After gaining their freedom, Bayley and his wife worked as tenant farmers. He started work in a sawmill to earn more money. Their son Spence had been sold earlier and was auctioned at a sale in 1813 after his master's death. Prices had risen and Bayley despaired of being able to buy him, but white men who knew Bayley from the Methodist church aided him in buying his son's freedom, at a price of more than $360.Bayley 1825, pp. 29-32 As their children grew, Bayley apprenticed them to \\"good families\\", so that they could learn skills and gain educations. About this time, Bayley also arranged for his mother to come to them from New Jersey, and she lived with him to \\"a great age\\", as her own mother had done.Bayley (1825), p. 41 In 1820 Bayley met Robert Hurnard, a Quaker and abolitionist from Essex, England, who was visiting Delaware. After hearing the story of his life, Hurnard encouraged Bayley to write about it and publish an account. He corresponded with Bayley for years afterward, and Hurnard wrote a preface for the memoir, which was published in London in 1825. In 1821 both Bayley's oldest and youngest daughters died, Margaret and Leah, respectively, several months apart; they were in their early 20s. In each case, he wrote about their faith in their last days.Bayley (1825), pp. 42-44 Quote: \\"I desire to give the pious, a brief account of the life and death of my youngest daughter, Leah Bayley, who departed this life the 27th of the 7th month, 1821, aged twenty-one years, six months, and one day.\\"Robert Hurnard, Preface to A Narrative of Some Remarkable Incidents in the Life of Solomon Bayley..., (1825) Emigration to Africa Bayley learned about Paul Cuffee, a wealthy African-American shipbuilder in Boston, Massachusetts, who promoted free blacks emigrating to Africa. This idea appealed to Bayley but Cuffee died before the project could get well underway. In this period the American Colonization Society was established in 1817, to encourage free blacks to emigrate to a colony it established as Liberia in West Africa in the antebellum years. It was supported by both slaveholders and abolitionists, who thought for different reasons that free blacks might have more opportunity in their own society in Africa.Exhibit: The African American Mosaic, February 9–August 29, 1994; Library of Congress Its members helped to support transportation costs for free blacks, and in the early years states such as Virginia and Maryland contributed to resettlement. While most free African Americans wanted to make their lives in the United States with rights that recognized their citizenship, some did emigrate. Bayley and his wife Thamar were among them, going in 1827 after their children were grown. He served as a Methodist missionary and worked as a farmer. They lived near the main settlement of Monrovia. In 1833 he published a book about the colony, describing its products and society. In it he expressed an ambivalent attitude toward the African natives, describing them as \\"benighted\\" and in need of Christianity, but he was also hopeful about potential autonomy for African Americans in the colony. Slaves using the courts In the 19th century, African Americans petitioned various levels of government on a variety of issues. When necessary, they used the courts. Numerous individuals addressed the topics of personal freedom and economic discrimination in their appeals. To explain his thinking about using the legal avenues open to him, Solomon Bayley wrote: \\"I thought where the law made liberty the right of any man, he could not be wrong in trying to recover it.\\" Bayley threatened to take his master to court for transporting his family out of state and immediately selling them on arrival in Virginia. He was successful in gaining an out-of- court settlement that included his master's accepting an arrangement whereby he could buy his freedom over time. Other African Americans were also sometimes successful in petitioning the courts to right wrongs if their masters violated the law.Bayley 1825, pp. 17-18. Particularly in areas on the western frontier between slave and free states, for instance in St. Louis, Missouri and in Louisiana, hundreds of slaves filed freedom suits, challenging the grounds of their enslavement and sometimes winning freedom. The legal justifications for the institution of slavery included exceptions. Slaves claimed the right to freedom based on Native American ancestry (where Native American slavery had been prohibited), or on masters knowingly holding them in free states past the limits set by those states' laws. For decades before the Civil War, state courts often observed a precedent of \\"once free, always free\\", until the Dred Scott ruling by the United States Supreme Court. Works Bayley's memoir, A Narrative of Some Remarkable Incidents in the Life of Solomon Bayley (1825), is one of the earliest of the genre known as slave narratives. Published in London in 1825, it is forty-eight pages in length. It was based in part on correspondence between Bayley and Hurnard. Bayley expresses his religious faith throughout, in his escape, his efforts to buy freedom for himself and his family, and other trials. He was a Methodist who saw his life through a Christian perspective. His escape and recapture are covered in detail. Yolanda N. Pierce has explored Bayley's memoir and four other slave narratives from the standpoint of slave agency. A.J. Raboteau noted that she said the plot line of most of them \\"constitutes a picaresque journey of incredible incidents, ... all governed by Divine Providence\\".Raboteau (2005), quoted in the article Referring to Pierce's account, Raboteau notes that \\"These narratives describe a double journey from slavery to freedom, spiritual and physical. Their rhetorical structure frequently oscillates between an interpretive perspective that is (sometimes in the same paragraph) both African and Western.\\" Pierce says that Bayley's narrative merges African and Western belief, creating a “liminal space” for Bayley “in which he does not have to abandon one to adopt the other”.Yolanda Nicole Pierce (2005), p. 3 Raboteau noted that Bayley was inspired to compassion by his Christian faith, drawing from it to grapple with challenges in slavery and as a free man. For instance, he belonged to the same Methodist class meeting as his wife's master, who threatened to see Thamar and Bayley's infant daughter. Bayley wrote in his memoir that it was extremely difficult > to keep up true love and unity between him and me, in the sight of God: this > was a cause of wrestling in my mind; but that scripture abode with me, 'He > that loveth father or mother, wife or children, more than me, is not worthy > of me; then I saw it became me to hate the sin with all my heart, but still > the sinner love; but I should have fainted, if I had not looked to Jesus, > the author of my faith'...Raboteau 2002, quoted in the lecture In 1833 Bayley published his \\"A Brief Account of the Colony of Liberia\\", based on his emigration to the African colony and work there as a missionary. According to Raboteau, he expressed the \\"ultimate ambiguity\\", that “his duty as a Christian was to bring religion to the ‘benighted’ regions of Africa, while choosing to emigrate there as a true place of freedom, removed from the hell of American slavery.” See also *List of slaves Sources * Bayley, Solomon (1825), A Narrative of Some Remarkable Incidents in the Life of Solomon Bayley, Formerly a Slave in the State of Delaware, North America, London: Harvey and Darton; posted at Documenting the American South, University of North Carolina * Bayley, Solomon (1833), \\"A Brief Account of the Colony of Liberia\\", Wilmington, Delaware * Dalleo, Peter T.

Alan is obsessed with Carrie, and after being thwarted in having her, Alan turns his rage on Sami. On a date where Sami came to cook Alan dinner, he pins her down and rapes her, taking her virginity. Lucas notices that Alan and Sami are both behaving strangely, and he corners Sami and asks her what has happened. Sami admits that she has been raped and tells Lucas the whole story. Afterward, Lucas physically confronts Alan and warns him to stay away from Sami. Lucas works hard to get Alan's confession on tape for the rape trial. Some boys taunt Sami about her rape, and Lucas comforts Sami. In a moment when their guards are down, Lucas and Sami make love – and their son Will is conceived. Soon after that, Austin's sister, Billie Reed (Lisa Rinna), is put on trial for the murder of her father Curtis Reed (Nick Benedict). Not only is Billie found to be innocent, but during the proceedings, Lucas's mother, Kate Roberts, finds out that her supposedly dead children by Curtis are alive, and they are Billie and Austin – and so Lucas learns that he has a brother and sister. When Sami discovers she is pregnant, she claims the baby is Austin's (she had previously drugged Austin, in order that he would have sex with her). Sami believes Austin is the father, and she doesn't even consider the possibility that Lucas is the dad. Sami gives birth to William Robert Reed (Shawn and Taylor Carpenter) in the episode airing November 16, 1995. Lucas becomes very attached to his \\"nephew\\" Will, much to the dismay of Sami, who, when Will has to be taken to hospital after a near-drowning, discovers that Lucas is in fact Will's father. Austin and Sami are set to be married, and Sami tries to keep Will's real paternity a secret, but Carrie discovers it, and the secret is revealed to all on Austin and Sami's wedding day, and Austin leaves Sami at the altar. = Antagonists = Lucas wants custody of his son. However, Sami gets in his way, claiming that Lucas has abused Will, and that she has witnessed it. Sami gets a restraining order against Lucas. Sami befriends Franco Kelly (Victor Alfieri), and they become engaged; but Franco is using her to get a greencard and stay in the country. Lucas does not want Franco to be Will's step father, and Lucas's mother Kate (now played by Lauren Koslow) tries to manipulate Franco in to calling off the wedding, but Franco attacks Kate with a poker, nearly killing her. Lucas walks in on this and saves his mother's life by shooting Franco dead. Sami later comes across the body and faints near it. Kate frames Sami for the killing so that she will go to jail and Lucas can have full custody of Will. In the meantime Lucas, who has gotten drunk, kidnaps his son, and then gets into a car accident, which requires Will to have brain surgery. Sami gives custody of Will to Austin when she is sent to jail for Franco's murder. Sami is sentenced to death by lethal injection. All the while she proclaims her innocence. Lucas falls in love with Nicole Walker (Arianne Zucker), but she is in love with Sami's brother Eric Brady (Jensen Ackles), and Kate pays Nicole five million dollars for her to marry Lucas, so that he can gain custody of Will whilst Sami is in jail. Lucas's conscience then gets the better of him, and at the last minute he rushes to stop Sami's execution, shouting that he killed Franco. The execution is halted, but not because of Lucas. It is halted because a dying mobster associate of Franco sings a confession at the behest of Kate. Sami is freed and falls in love with Brandon Walker (Matt Cedeño), who helps her regain full custody of Will from Lucas. They obtain proof that it was Lucas who actually killed Franco, and Sami uses that information to blackmail Lucas – but it is Kate who forces Lucas to give up custody of his son. Losing Will absolutely destroys Lucas, and throws him back into the bottle. While drunk one night, Lucas is caught in the fire that Kate has set to kill Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston), and almost dies. After spending months in a special hospital and then in rehabilitation, Lucas comes back to Salem, more determined than ever to hurt Sami. Lucas soon gets a job working with Tony DiMera (Thaao Penghlis), and when he finds proof that Sami was involved in criminal activity – switching the paternity results on Lexie Carver's (Renée Jones) baby – and he uses this information to break up Brandon and Sami only moments after they are married. Their marriage is annulled. Lucas and Tony are celebrating at the DiMera mansion when Sami bursts in, and in the ensuing scuffle, Tony ends up throwing Sami through the lounge's glass doors. She is taken to the hospital in critical condition, and Lucas goes to a bar to drown his sorrows, and allows himself for the first time in years to remember the friendship he and Sami once shared as he waits to hear if she is going to live or die. = New beginnings, new challenges = Lucas takes care of Sami after she is released from hospital, often against her wishes. As they spend more time together, Lucas finds his heart softening towards his one-time worst enemy, and the two share a few nights together (all platonic, of course), and some steamy kisses. When Sami's father Roman (Josh Taylor) is apparently murdered, Lucas is there to comfort her. He is careful though, because he does not want Will to get his hopes up, and he still hasn't completely forgiven Sami. Lucas and Sami continue to grow closer during the Salem Stalker serial killer storyline, and ultimately they confess their love for each other. They make love for the first time since Will's conception on April 3, 2004. Lucas successfully proposes to Sami on August 5, 2004 after singing \\"When a man loves a woman\\" to her in front of an audience at the Penthouse Grill. Kate is not pleased, and the night before their wedding, with the help of Eugenia, she drugs Sami and Brandon, and places them in bed together, where Lucas finds them. Lucas leaves Sami, and both are devastated. Sami's sorely compromised psychological state deteriorates to such a degree that she becomes a secret transvestite under an assumed name, \\"Stan\\" (played by Dan Wells) – a character that wreaks havoc on Salem for months, working for Tony DiMera, and selling illicit drugs to a pain-wracked John Black (Drake Hogestyn) – all out of a base-born, suppositious need for revenge. Sami attempts to redeem herself, and with Nicole's help, Sami is able to secure the evidence that Kate and Eugenia had set her up, and she convinces Lucas that she was never unfaithful. The two reunite and agree to marry once again. Moments before Lucas and Sami are to wed, Kate crashes the wedding, and reveals to all that the havoc-wreaking Stan was Sami; and Lucas leaves Sami again. Sami is shunned by everyone in Salem, except for Austin, who had returned for the wedding. She lets Austin move into her apartment. In the meantime, Lucas pursues Carrie, who has also returned to Salem. Lucas begins to date Carrie, and Sami begins to date Austin, and this leads to the eventual marriage of Lucas and Carrie, and the near marriage of Austin and Sami. But a mysterious gloved hand leaves a note that warns Sami not to go through with her wedding to Austin, or it will be revealed that Sami actually blackmailed Lexie into telling Carrie that she could not bear children. Carrie cheats on Lucas almost instantaneously, and after Will (now Christopher Gerse) goes missing, Lucas and Carrie split up, allowing Lucas and Sami to become closer again. Happily Will turns up – he had just run away, because he was embarrassed by Sami jilting Austin at the altar. But Sami's blackmailing of Lexie is revealed anyway, and everyone shuns Sami again, and Lucas and Will move out, leaving her devastated. Austin and Carrie get back together and relocate to Switzerland. Sami is attracted to her new neighbor, EJ Wells (James Scott), and after her wedding disaster, they kiss for the first time. But Sami then discovers that not only is EJ the son of the villainous Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo), but that he is also sleeping with Kate. = Marriage and Sami's twins = Sami and Lucas reunite, and after getting caught in a snowstorm, Sami and Lucas make love. The roof of the cabin in which they've found sanctuary collapses on Lucas, trapping him. Sami goes to get help, and she flags down a motorist which turns out to be EJ DiMera. She tries to get out of the car but he would not allow her, holds a gun to her, and demands that she help get him through a roadblock as she pleads for him to help her save Lucas. After helping EJ get through the roadblock, EJ tells Sami he will only save Lucas if she has sex with him. She is disgusted and immediately refers to his proposal as blackmail and rape, but she agreed to his terms because she feels it is her only chance to save Lucas. EJ saves Lucas then runs off to Mexico. Sami is expecting, and on May 9, 2007, to the delight of their son Will, Lucas and Sami are married. At the reception a photo is revealed of Sami and EJ in Lexie Carver's car the night John Black was shot and Lucas was trapped in the cave in. Sami is forced to tell everyone the truth. She is afraid that after the reveal, she will lose Lucas again, this time maybe for good. She is surprised when he refuses to let it ruin the happiest day of their lives. Later at their apartment he tells her that there is no need to confess to him, because he trusts her. On May 10, 2007, Sami tells Lucas all about the night of the accident and about agreeing to have sex with EJ. Lucas is enraged, immediately calling what EJ did to Sami \\"rape\\", and wants to go after EJ. Sami tells him if he does, then the DiMeras would come after them. Lucas is completely understanding when Sami tells him that she only gave in to EJ to save Lucas's life. Lucas tells Sami that he is ashamed of the man he used to be, the one that had loved her and left her in the past, and because of that he thinks that Sami was afraid to come and tell him when EJ had started threatening her. Sami tells him that he isn't to blame, and that she is the one who has messed up time and time again. On May 22, 2007, the psychic Celeste Perrault (Tanya Boyd), predicts that EJ DiMera is the father of Sami's baby. However, on June 18, 2007 Sami finds out that she is actually pregnant with twins. Sami has a paternity test, but thanks to Kate's blackmailing of Nick Fallon (Blake Berris) to create a false paternity report, EJ is believed to be the father of her twins for a number of weeks. Then, in the episodes airing July 30 and 31, it is revealed that Lucas is apparently the father of both children. On October 23, 2007 Sami gives birth to a girl and a boy – Allie Horton and Johnny. And in another twist, there is another DNA test, and on November 2, Lucas learns that Johnny is really EJ's son. Stefano promises to end the Brady/Dimera blood feud if Sami marries his son EJ; and in order to save lives and protect her family, Sami asks Lucas for a divorce. Lucas reluctantly agrees, and Sami and EJ are married in November 2007. Just after the ceremony is completed, EJ is shot in the back and temporarily paralyzed. Lucas sends Will to live in Switzerland with his Austin and Carrie, in order to protect him. Sami and Lucas remained sexually intimate despite her nominal marriage to EJ. On December 20, Lucas tells Kate that he shot EJ. Despite Kate's protests, he confesses to the police and is sent to prison. Lucas tells Sami to get on with her life. He requests only that she stay away from EJ because he does not trust him. It is later revealed that it was actually Will who shot EJ, and Lucas confessed to protect his son. Whilst Lucas is in prison, EJ tries to take custody of Johnny, but as immigration wants to deport EJ, Sami moves into the DiMera mansion with Johnny and Allie, in order to prove that they are happily married couple. They later have sex, and Lucas, released on house arrest, sees them. Sami ends her marriage to EJ, but Lucas can't forgive her. = Friends and co-parents = In March 2009 Lucas marries Chloe Lane (Nadia Bjorlin), though that relationship ends when she has an affair with Daniel Jonas (Shawn Christian). Sami begins seeing her former FBI bodyguard from the Witness Protection Program, Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering), and becomes involved in a love triangle with him and EJ. Sami and Lucas become good friends again, and they amicably co-parent their son Will (now Dylan Patton) who has returned to Salem, and their daughter Allie. Lucas eventually gets a job offer in Hong Kong and moves there, though he does return for a few days for the funeral of his grandmother Alice Horton in June 2010. On February 29, 2012, Sami calls Lucas for advice. On March 2, Lucas returns to Salem and goes to see Sami at her apartment. They admit to each other that they still love each other and they share a hug. Lucas later reveals to Sami that he has a fiancée named Autumn, who Sami calls \\"Winter\\" and \\"April\\". Once Lucas finds out that Sami was the mole at Countess Wilhelmina, he promises to keep her secret. Stefano DiMera gives Sami the title of CEO at Countess Wilhelmina as revenge for his wife's Kate's affair with Ian McAllister. On April 23, Autumn breaks up with Lucas, via phone, saying she was sick of waiting on him to come back to Hong Kong. On April 27, Lucas, Sami, Will (now Chandler Massey), and Allie have a fun day together as a family. Sami thanks Lucas for everything and gives him a hug. Lucas kisses her on the cheek, and bit by bit over the following weeks, Lucas and Sami become romantically involved again. But EJ sees them kissing and gets jealous. He talks about their kids and how if Lucas is in their life they would get confused. With EJ as a competitor for Sami's affections, Lucas and Sami's new relationship does not last the summer, and on August 27, Lucas tells Sami officially that they are through. He refuses to listen to her especially after she runs away with EJ, but they decide to continue to work together as co- parents to Allie and Will. Both are taken aback when their son Will comes out as gay, but they both come around to supporting him. On May 21, 2013, Sami and Lucas became grandparents to Arianna, Will's daughter with Gabi Hernandez; and on April 3, 2014, they are proud parents at the wedding of their son Will (now Guy Wilson), to Sonny Kiriakis (Freddie Smith). = Bereavement = In October 2014, EJ is shot dead, and Lucas comforts Sami. In order to get the children away from Stefano, Sami relocates to California with Alllie, Johnny, and Sydney (and Will and Arianna accompany them for the first few weeks). On October 9, 2015, Will's body is found on the floor of his apartment in Salem. He has apparently been murdered (by strangulation), and the first-responders declare that he is dead. Sami returns to Salem for Will's funeral. Sami and Lucas go to the morgue together, and grieve over their son's body; and they give eulogies at his funeral. = The Hunt for Will = In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumors that Will is somehow still alive. She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information. Rolf reveals he was the masked medical examiner that attended Will's body just after Sami and Lucas viewed it. He says Stefano \\"had nothing to do with Will's resurrection\\", but then kills himself before revealing his true employer. The Salem Police Department hack Rolf's computer, and find the source of payments to Rolf's account is an address in Memphis. Sami persuades the police to give her the address, and flies off to Memphis with John, Marlena, Sonny and his current partner, Paul. Sami does not include or tell Lucas, as he is drinking and having hallucinations. Sami gets herself arrested when they break into the property, and Lucas, who has followed them to Memphis, goes to see her at the police station. Whilst concerned about her, he is furious with her for leaving him behind, and they argue. Sami implores him to seek help for his drinking and to help her, but he, not wanting to let himself believe Will is alive, walks out. Lucas goes to a bar to drink, where he actually sees Will (now Chandler Massey) but thinks he is hallucinating again. Will's father-in-law, the lawyer Justin Kiriakis, arranges for Sami's release – and she pursues leads on Will. However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave – and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive – but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled. Will returns to Salem to find out about his former life, where Lucas and Will are re-united. Will meets his daughter, but even this does not trigger Will's memory. Sami is desperate to help Will remember, and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and remembering; and Lucas is furious at her for her outrageous actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Yet Lucas is upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, and he carries on drinking, and ends up crashing his car whilst under the influence of alcohol. Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital, and pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, and encourages Lucas to take the first step towards sobriety, as, thanks to Sami's tough love, he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realizes her presence in Salem is not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, Lucas and Will build a new friendship.

A former quarrying village, quicklime and silica brick production centre, its fortunes rose and fell as a result of the Industrial Revolution in South Wales. It is now an important caving centre. Beneath Penwyllt and the surrounding area is the extensive limestone cave system of Ogof Ffynnon Ddu, part of which was the first designated underground national nature reserve in the UK. A corresponding area on the surface is also part of the national nature reserve, on the slopes of Carreg Cadno. Geography Penwyllt is a hamlet located in the upper Swansea Valley in Powys, Wales within the Brecon Beacons National Park. History =Industrialisation= Penwyllt developed primarily as a result of the need for quicklime in the industrial processes in the lower Swansea Valley, taking limestone from the quarries and turning it into quicklime in lime kilns.Penwyllt - Craig-y-nos kilns Subsequently Penwyllt also supported the Penwyllt Dinas Silica Brick company,Images of Wales which quarried silica sand at Pwll Byfre from which it manufactured refractory bricks, a form of fire brick, at the Penwyllt brick works (closed 1937 or 1939). The bricks were destined for use in industrial furnaces. A narrow-gauge railway, with a rope worked incline ,The Colliery Guardian, Vol 85 pp1325-6, 19 June 1903 transported silica sand and stones to the brickworks, which was adjacent to the Neath and Brecon Railway (which on 1 July 1922 became part of the Great Western Railway).Barrie, D.S.M., A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain, Vol. 12 South Wales. David & Charles, 1980. A detailed account of the history of Penwyllt and its industries was provided by Matthews(1991).Matthews, Helen, (1991), \\"Penwyllt Village, Growth, Development and Decline\\", Local History Dissertation, University College of Swansea (25MB pdf file) =Christie 1819-1822= In 1819 Fforest Fawr (\\"Great Forest of Brecknock\\") was enclosed or divided up into fields, and large parts of it became the property of John Christie, a Scottish businessman based in London, who had become wealthy through the import of indigo. Christie developed a limestone quarry at Penwyllt, and decided to develop lime kilns there as well. In 1820 he moved to Brecon, and developed the Brecon Forest Tramroad.P R Reynolds, The Brecon Forest Tramroad (Swansea, 1979)Stephen Hughes, The Brecon Forest Tramroads: the archaeology of an early railway system, (Aberystwyth : Royal Commission on the Ancient & Historical Monuments of Wales, 1990) The tramroad ran from a depot at Sennybridge through Fforest Fawr by way of the limestone quarries at Penwyllt to the Drim Colliery near Onllwyn. A branch served the Gwaun Clawdd Colliery on the northern slopes of Mynydd y Drum and was extended to the Swansea Canal. Christie was declared bankrupt in 1827 and most of his assets, including the tramroad, eventually passed to his principal creditor, Joseph Claypon, of the banking house of Garfit & Claypon in Boston, Lincolnshire.Victorian Ystradgynlais - The Brecon Forest Tramroad =Claypon 1827-1850= Claypon took over Christie's assets, and came to the conclusion that shipping lime, coal, iron ore and quicklime south to the larger industrial premises in the southern Swansea Valley was more productive than trying to serve a small rural population of the Usk valley to the north. They quickly sold or leased the farms and developments north of Fforest Fawr and concentrated on expanding the lime kilns at or around Penwyllt. In total there were fifteen lime kilns at Penwyllt: *Penwyllt quarry: two lime kilns created in the railway age by \\"Jeffreys, Powell and Williams\\", dated 1878 *Pen-y-foel: a bank of four kilns near the Penwyllt Inn erected in around 1863 to 1867 by, it is thought, the Brecon Coal & Lime Co.

The population of Penwyllt grew on this increased transport ability to over 500 citizens by the 1881 Census. After being authorised to extend the railway to Brecon, it changed its name to the Neath and Brecon Railway. The railway agreed to co-operate with the Swansea Vale Railway to create the Swansea Vale and Neath and Brecon Junction Railway linking the railway fully into Neath, as well as the South Wales Railway mainline. An early and unsuccessful purchaser of the new Fairlie locomotive, when in 1863 the railway reached Crynant, coal mining quickly expanded. At Crynant several new mines were opened including the Crynant colliery, Brynteg colliery in 1904, Llwynon colliery in 1905, Dillwyn colliery, and Cefn Coed colliery 1930http://www.swansea.gov.uk/westglamorganarchives/index.cfm?articleid=13542&articleaction;=print Craig-y-nos railway station at Craig-y-nos/Penwyllt was in part funded by opera singer Adelina Patti, who lived at and extended Craig-y-Nos Castle. She built a road from the castle to the station and a separate waiting room. The railway supplied her in return with her own railroad car, which she could request to go anywhere within the United Kingdom. =Decline 1870= As the industrialisation declined with reducing economic stocks of coal, iron ore and limestone and the development of new technologies on a larger scale on the coast of South Wales, particularly at Port Talbot and Llanwern, Penwyllt declined. By 1870 the seven blast furnace ironworks of Ynyscedwyn had only one working furnace. =20th century= World War II created the final closure, as the need to scale production upwards for the larger coastal meant the heavily manual process of Penwyllt quarry was uneconomic compared to other British and foreign facilities which could bulk ship by sea. The Penwyllt Inn,Images of Wales or 'Stump' as it was often known, closed in 1948, and in October 1962 all passenger services were withdrawn by British Rail from Neath and Brecon Railway line. The line north of Craig-y-nos/Penwyllt station closed to Brecon on closure of Brecon station, and by the end of the 1960s the population had fallen to 20 people. The railway line remained open south to Neath until 1977 to serve the quarry until it ceased major production and effectively closed.cyn.JPG :: Craig y Nos/Penwyllt Station looking north on 14 April 2006. The Neath & Brecon line to this point lingered on to serve the adjacent quarry until 1977 (officially closed 1981) Many of the former industrial buildings, commercial properties and houses of Penwyllt were demolished in the early 1980s, being both beyond economic repair and unneeded. =21st Century= The former pub survives as private accommodation for cavers. The former Craig-y- nos/Penwyllt station survives in good repair as a private holiday cottage. Patti Row, a historic block of back-to-back houses dating from the days of the Brecon Forest Tramroad,Hughes, Stephen, The Brecon Forest Tramroads, RCAHM in Wales, 1990, survives in a derelict state.

In 2008 it was again dormant. In 2009 it was operational but at a relatively low level of activity.

It is commonly known as madhūka. mahuwa, mahua, mahwa, mohulo, or Iluppai or vippa chettu. It is a fast-growing tree that grows to approximately 20 meters in height, possesses evergreen or semi- evergreen foliage, and belongs to the family Sapotaceae.Pankaj Oudhia, Robert E. Paull. Butter tree Madhuca latifolia Roxb. Sapotaceae p827-828. Encyclopedia of Fruit and Nuts - 2008, J. Janick and R. E. Paull -editors, CABI, Wallingford, United Kingdom It is adaptable to arid environments, being a prominent tree in tropical mixed deciduous forests in India in the states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Gujarat, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. Uses It is cultivated in warm and humid regions for its oleaginous seeds (producing between 20 and 200 kg of seeds annually per tree, depending on maturity), flowers and wood. The fat (solid at ambient temperature) is used for the care of the skin, to manufacture soap or detergents, and as a vegetable butter. It can also be used as a fuel oil. The seed cakes obtained after extraction of oil constitute very good fertilizer. The flowers are used to produce an alcoholic drink in tropical India. This drink is also known to affect the animals.https://myfox8.com/2012/11/07/50-drunken-elephants-ransack-village-in- india-drink-130-gallons-of-moonshine/ Several parts of the tree, including the bark, are used for their medicinal properties. It is considered holy by many tribal communities because of its usefulness. M. longifolia in Hyderabad, India The leaves of Madhuca indica (= M. longifolia) are fed on by the moth Antheraea paphia, which produces tassar silk, a form of wild silk of commercial importance in India. Leaves, flowers and fruits are also lopped to feed goats and sheep.Heuzé V., Tran G., Archimède H., Bastianelli D., Lebas F., 2017. Mahua (Madhuca longifolia). Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/131 The Tamils have several uses for M. longifolia (iluppai in Tamil). The saying \\"aalai illaa oorukku iluppaip poo charkkarai\\" indicates when there is no cane sugar available, the flower of M. longifolia can be used, as it is very sweet. However, Tamil tradition cautions that excessive use of this flower will result in imbalance of thinking and may even lead to lunacy.Dr. J.Raamachandran, HERBS OF SIDDHA MEDICINES-The First 3D Book on Herbs, pp38 The alkaloids in the press cake of mahua seeds is reportedly used in killing fishes in aquaculture ponds in some parts of India. The cake serves to fertilise the pond, which can be drained, sun dried, refilled with water and restocked with fish fingerlings.Keenan, G.I., 1920.

They use it to make syrup for medicinal purposes. They are also fermented to produce the alcoholic drink mahua, a country liquor. Tribals of Bastar in Chhattisgarh and peoples of Western Orissa, Santhals of Santhal Paraganas (Jharkhand), Koya tribals of North-East Andhra Pradesh (vippa saara: విప్ప సారా), Bhil tribal in western Madhya Pradesh and tribals of North Maharashtra consider the tree and the mahua drink as part of their cultural heritage. Mahua is an essential drink for tribal men and women during celebrations. Mahula fruit is an essential food of Western Odisha people. The tree has a great cultural significance. There are many varieties of food prepared with the help of fruits and flowers. Also, Western Odisha people use to pray this tree during festivals. The liquor produced from the flowers is largely colourless, opaque and not very strong. It is inexpensive and the production is largely done in home stills. Mahua flowers are also used to manufacture jam, which is made by tribal co-operatives in the Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra. MahuaIn many parts of Bihar, such as villages in the district of Siwan, the flowers of mahua tree are sun-dried; these sun-dried flowers are ground to flour and used to make various kinds of breads. The locals also use mahua flowers to make wine.

The Blackadder lairds of Tulliallan, a branch of the Blackadder border clan, wielded considerable power in the 15th and 16th centuries. The modern Tulliallan Castle is relatively recent, built in 1812-1820 and now the home of the Scottish Police College Parish Felled and replanted area, Devilla Forest Known as Tulliallan Forest on older maps, Devilla is a long established forest on undulating, sometimes marshy ground. The original parish of Tulliallan covered only the barony of Tulliallan. In 1673 it was extended to include the barony of Kincardine and the lands of Lurg, Sands and Kellywood, formerly included in the neighbouring Culross parish. For many years the parishes of Culross and Tulliallan formed an exclave some miles away from the rest of Perthshire, on the boundaries of Clackmannanshire and Fife. Culross and Tulliallan were transferred to Fife based on the recommendations of the boundary commission appointed under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. The parish is bounded on the west and north by Clackmannan, on the east by Culross and on the south by the River Forth. It is from north to south and from east to west, and contains . In 1885, were foreshore and water. The parish slopes gently southward to the Forth from a height of Between 1823 and 1839 a large area of land was recovered from the tidal waters of the Forth by two large embankments. The 1885 description said about was wooded and almost all the rest cultivated. High-quality sandstone had been quarried near Longannet for many years. The land was also rich in coal and ironstone. Old castle The first fortification at Tulliallan was built some time before 1304, when it was ordered to be strengthened by Edward I of England. The position was strategic, near the main ferry over the Forth, and in 1304 Edward I gave orders for the walls of \\"Tolyalwyn\\" to be strengthened. Presumably this would have included strengthening the D-shaped moat and the outer rampart, making the position strong against attack across the marshy land, which would not be drained until the 18th century. There would have been buildings within the enclosure, but the old castle was probably built later, by the Douglasses. The Douglas castle was initially an L-shaped two-storey building of ashlar masonry, with a tower at the southwest corner holding the main entrance, which was reached by a drawbridge. Most of the ground floor had small, square windows, while there were large slits above. The interior was unusual in that there were important rooms on the ground floor. The ceilings of these rooms included ribbed vaults springing from octagonal piers. The house was extended in the fifteenth century, and a major reconstruction seems to have been undertaken in the late sixteenth century. The castle was surrounded by a moat, which would have been filled by water from the Firth of Forth, which in the old days extended further inland. An 1853 account of the then-ruined building said \\"two narrow posterns open from each end of the southern front, of which that on the east opens into an apartment which has been termed the great hall, where three compartments are curiously formed by elegant groined arches, which rest upon a central octagonal column, the whole being in a state of remarkable preservation. In 1885 the old castle, although ruined, was still described as an imposing-looking edifice. History The castle passed into the ownership of William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas ( (c. 1327–1384). Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas gifted the Tulliallan estate to the Edmiston family in 1402. In 1456 the gift was confirmed to Sir James Edmiston, great grandson of King Robert II of Scotland, by royal charter. Patrick Blackader, grandson of Cuthbert Blackader of Blackader Castle in Berwickshire, married Elizabeth Edmiston, daughter of Sir James. She brought the Tulliallan estate as her dowry. A noted member of the Blackadder family of Tulliallan was Robert Blackadder, brother of Patrick Blackadder, Laird of Tulliallan. Robert Blackadder was Bishop of Aberdeen, Bishop of Glasgow from 1484 and then in 1492 the first Archbishop of Glasgow, who added the eponymous crypt and aisle in Glasgow Cathedral. The bishop sided with rebel nobles who defeated and killed King James III of Scotland in 1488 at the Battle of Sauchieburn. The archbishop died while on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1508. One of the Lairds of Tulliallan, Sir John Blackadder, was beheaded in March 1531 for the murder of James Inglis, Abbot of Culross, in a dispute over land. He was succeeded at Tulliallan by his brother Patrick, who renewed a dispute against the Homes for the Blackadder family lands around Allanton in Berwickshire. Patrick was murdered in an ambush near Edinburgh, where he was to meet the Homes to try to resolve their differences. Following this the Blackadders made no further attempts to recover their ancestral estates. William Blackadder was among the supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots at the Battle of Carberry Hill (15 June 1567). He was arrested soon after and hanged in June, and his brother was hanged in September. The last Blackadder to own Tulliallan was Sir John, born in 1596 and on 18 July 1626 created a knight baronet of Nova Scotia by King Charles I of England. His estate, with lime works, salt pans and other enterprises, yielded an income of 36,000 merks annually, but this was not enough to satisfy Sir John's expensive habits and he ran up debts far beyond his ability to pay. When his effects were seized he fled to the continent, and in 1642 seems to have been in the French service. He died in America in 1651. Sir John's wife, Elizabeth Graham, was the daughter of the Earl of Menteith. She had an annuity of 360 merks, and lived at Tulliallan until 1662. His son, Alexander, could not free the estate from the burden of debts that his father had contracted. The Court of Session ordered a judicial sale. In 1700 the estate was purchased by Colonel John Erskine, son of David Erskine, 4th Lord Cardross. The celebrated covenanting preacher John Blackadder (1622-1685) was legally the heir to the Blackadder baronetcy, but did not claim the title.

The modern Tulliallan Castle, now a police college fairway which runs parallel to the A977 The last occupant of the old castle was Colonel Erskine, known locally as the \\"Black Colonel\\", who died in the 1790s. George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith bought the estate in 1799, and built today's castle as his family residence. The roof of the old castle was removed and it was allowed to crumble into ruins. An ancient bronze kettle was dug out of these ruins, about in diameter and high. Legend says that it formerly hung from one of the bosses of the castle roof, filled with gold. As long as it hung there, the castle would stand and the Blackadders of Tulliallan would prosper. The modern-day Tulliallan Castle is about a half mile to the southeast of the old castle, built in 1818-1820 for Lord Viscount Keith. The building was acquired by the Mitchell family in 1924. During the World War II it was the headquarters of the Polish Armed Forces in the West. It has been the home of the Scottish Police College since 1954 and was the temporary headquarters of Police Scotland upon its creation in 2013.

After considering millions of acres of forest land throughout the U.S., the Forest Service chose an undisturbed patch along Little Santeetlah Creek, which it dedicated as the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest in 1936.Alberta Brewer and Carson Brewer, Valley So Wild (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1975), 350-351. The sources of both Slickrock Creek and Little Santeetlah Creek are located high in the Unicoi Mountains, on opposite slopes of Bob Stratton Bald, a grassy bald overlooking the southwest corner of the Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness. Slickrock Creek rises on Stratton's northwestern slope and flows northeastward to its mouth along the Cheoah River. Little Santeetlah rises on Stratton's southeastern slope and flows southeastward to its mouth along Santeetlah Creek. Joyce Kilmer Memorial The Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest along Little Santeetlah Creek is a rare example of an old growth cove hardwood forest, an extremely diverse forest type unique to the Appalachian Mountains. Although there are many types of trees in Joyce Kilmer, dominant species include poplar, hemlock, red and white oak, basswood, beech, and sycamore. Many of the trees in Joyce Kilmer are over 400 years old. The largest rise to heights of over and have circumferences of up to . The Slickrock Creek basin is coated primarily by a mature second- growth cove hardwood forest, although a substantial old growth stand still exists in its upper watershed.United States Forest Service, \\"Joyce Kilmer- Slickrock Wilderness and Citico Creek Wilderness Map\\" (information on the reverse), 1996.Brewer and Brewer, 290, 350-351.

Geography 100-Foot-high Cross on \\"La Melonita\\" hill, in La Calera La Calera is located northeast of Valparaíso, and northwest of Santiago, in the Aconcagua River Valley. Its area is . La Calera borders Nogales to the north and west, Hijuelas to the east, and La Cruz to the south. The city of La Calera is partly enclosed by Route 5 and Route 60. History La Calera's name comes from the production of quicklime (Spanish \\"cal\\") that is obtained from the processed limestone (Spanish: piedra caliza) (calcium carbonate), extracted from the hills at the south of the town, which were already exploited by the Chilean and Peruvian Natives for some 400 years previously. Therefore, La Calera means \\"quicklime mine\\". Established by the Jesuits as a settlement of the Jesuit reduction, the estate of La Calera belonged to the Jesuits up to 1767, to the expulsion of Jesuits by the decree of King Charles III of Spain from 1 March 1767.Alejandra L. McCall. Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam: The Expulsion of the Jesuits from Chile and their Journey into Exile. University of North Carolina at Asheville, 2008. The Bavarian Jesuit missionary Karl von Haimhausen was prominent in the area's early development. The turning point came in 1842, when it was acquired by Bolivian citizen Ildefonso Huici (father of socialite Eugenia Errázuriz) who started industrialising it using local resources.Alvaro Mercado Jara. Paisaje re.creativo en la cuenca del Aconcagua. V. Reseña histórica de la calera surgimiento y desarrollo de la comuna desde el siglo xv al xxi. Universidad Católica de Valparaíso. 2010 By 1844, a small town had emerged consisting mainly in a number of workers' dwellings located around the factories and production centres established in it, giving life to what La Calera is today. Economy Due to its strategic crossroads location on the central valley and the pioneering and entrepreneurial work of locals and immigrants (Palestinian immigrants, Germans, Italians), La Calera has managed to remain a significant commercial and services centre to the interior of the Valparaiso Region, even though it is not the capital city of the Province. It also remains an important industrial base, employing a fair share of the rural population around it. =Industries and commercial markets= *Cemento Melón *Sopraval *Algamar *Falabella Shopping Plaza *Ripley Shopping Plaza Demographics According to data from the Census 2002 by the National Statistics Institute, the commune's population was 49,503 inhabitants (24,134 men and 25,369 women). Of these, 47,836 (96.6%) lived in urban areas and 1,667 (3.4%) in rural areas. Its 2007 estimated population was 50,644. La Calera holds 3.21% of the total population of the region. The city's central location in between Santiago de Chile and Valparaiso on the coast made the city of La Calera a true crossroads of industrial development. Amongst the important immigrant communities set in La Calera before 1950, Palestinians and Italians stand out, which makes the town with the largest proportion of Palestine people in Latin America. The small but well prominent Palestinian community was recently reported in international news media. Even a former Mayor of the city was of Palestinian descent. As mentioned, Italians as well as French immigrants have established a thriving agricultural economy. La Calera has a mestizo cultural identity and over half the people have some Amerindian ancestry. It is estimated that Spanish descendants and mestizos make up more than 90% of the population. =Notable Caleranos= The demonym for a person from La Calera is Calerano for a man, or Calerana for a woman.

Jac tries to do the right thing and tells Jonny about her on night stand before he found out any other way but he still gets mad so Jac decided to travel to Japan to do some training on new medical techniques. Jac comes back to work a day early to put her training in to use and catches Jonny off guard. After Jac has an accident on the ward she tells Jonny that she loves him and they continue with their relationship. However Jac starts to experience abdominal pains that she worries is something to do with her kidney but when the ultrasound comes back clear she refers herself to obs and gynie and is diagnosed with endometriosis. Jac keeps her diagnosis to herself and after a confrontation outside theatre Jonny dumps her. When Tara Lo sends an email to everyone, informing them of her brain tumour and that she will be undergoing surgery to have it removed, Jac is extremely surprised and upset by the news. When Tara dies in surgery after complications, Jac is deeply saddened despite the fact she had acted very cold towards her throughout her time at Holby. That night, Jac sleeps with Jonny and later discovers that she is pregnant. A few weeks later, Jonny discovers Jac's pregnancy when he finds Mo's drawing. Although Jac is convinced she's miscarried, Jonny convinces her to take a pregnancy test. Jac finds out that she is still pregnant. Jac tells Jonny about her endometriosis and he performs an ultrasound on Jac and they see their baby for the first time. Jac has her next ultrasound scan booked at a private clinic on the other side of town. However, it is cancelled and Jonny begs the midwife at Holby City General Hospital for an appointment. Jac has her scan and it reveals everything is fine, this leads to Jonny finally announcing Jac's pregnancy publicly to the entire ward. During Jac's 20-week scan, she finds out that her baby has congenital diaphragmatic hernia and only a 50% chance of survival after birth. Jonny tells Jac he will support her in any decision she makes. Jac decides to have an abortion. Soon after Jonny finds out about Jac's plans and tries to stop her. Unfortunately for Jonny, Jac has already left the clinic. Later, Jonny finds Jac back at the hospital and asks if she's okay. Jac then reveals she's still pregnant, confirming she didn't go through with the termination. Jac and Jonny have their first pre-natal class. The next week Jonny tells Jac that he's visited a couple with a child who has CDH. Jac gets furious, because she feels that Jonny is doing things behind her back. It is obvious though that Jac is just as scared about the future as Jonny. Jonny asks Jac to move in together and a stunned Jac unable to say anything. A couple of days later Jac throws her flat keys at Jonny and tells him to move in with her. Later, Jonny's old friend Bonnie Wallis (Carlyss Peer) appears on the ward. Jac gets jealous of Bonnie and threatens to fire her. Jonny, feeling sympathetic for Bonnie, returns the keys on Jac's desk. A couple of weeks later Bonnie tells Jac she and Jonny are dating and living together. Jac goes into labour a week early and is forced to have an emergency caesarean. The baby shows signs of distress and isn't breathing right after birth. However, the doctors are able to stabilise her, and she pulls through. At first, Jac has a hard time bonding with her daughter, but after seeing Bonnie hold the baby, Jac's maternal side comes rushing to the fore. Jac decides to name her daughter Emma. Emma's birth softens Jac, but it also complicates things between Jac and Jonny. Jac wants to hire a nanny, whilst Jonny is keen on having the baby christened. As Jonny and Bonnie's relationship develops Jac gets increasingly jealous and attempts to rile Jonny. On the day of Jonny and Bonnie's wedding Jac delays Jonny by agreeing to perform surgery on Bonnie's brother in an attempt to prevent the marriage. The surgery is successful yet Jonny informs Jac he and Bonnie will be leaving after the wedding as he is unable to get Jac out of his head. Jac then kisses Jonny in an attempt to get him to stay, but after being unable to tell him she loves him, Jonny leaves to marry Bonnie. However, Bonnie dies after being hit by a truck shortly before the wedding. Jonny blames Jac for Bonnie's death and they become locked in a custody battle for Emma. Jac's mother, Paula, is admitted to the hospital with terminal cancer. Jac pays Paula to leave and she gives the money to Jonny. After learning about Jac's past with Paula, Jonny apologises to Jac. They bond over a patient and Emma's brief hospitalisation. However, Jac then learns that Paula is staying with Jonny, despite him knowing about their past. Jac's mum health gets worse and starts going badly wrong, and Paula dies. The morning after, Jac and Emma watch the sun rise and they both meet Johnny at the hospital and Jac gives Emma to him for him to look after as she is going to Sweden. As Jac goes to the airport Johnny carries Emma asking her to reconsider. But Jac boards the plane. Jac returns prematurely after learning of Elliot Hope's worsening health to help with the Herzig 5 (artificial heart) project which leads to her having to take the lead halfway through the crucial operation being used to market the device. Guy then attempts to tempt Jac into taking Elliot's place; leading the Herzig 5 project and running Darwin ward. Jac is reunited with Connie by Guy for an endarterectomy procedure, pushing Jac into accepting Guy's offer of taking over Elliot's work. After the departure of Jonny, Jac also takes extended maternity leave and ends her brief fling with hospital CEO, Guy Self (John Michie). In the time that she is gone, Hanssen is reappointed CEO following the decision of Guy to step down in order to maintain his surgical timetable, and the creation of his Neuro Centre. Jac briefly returns to aid Elliot, Oliver and Zosia March (Camilla Arfwedson) in the treatment of previous hospital nurse/junior doctor Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori). She eventually gives Elliot the advice to follow his heart with his old flame Brigitte Nye (Sally Dexter) in order to help those with tuberculosis in Pakistan. Jac makes her full-term return as Cardiothoracic Consultant, as well as Clinical Lead, and is hellbent on getting rid of the 'deadwood' on Darwin. She arrives to find that Guy Self has taken part of Darwin for his neurosurgery patients, to her dismay. She also questions Zosia's dedication to Cardiothoracics (having been indecisive about specialisms in the past). Zosia proves herself to Jac in theatre and Jac becomes satisfied with her team. Agency nurse, Fran Reynolds (Carli Norris) is transferred to Darwin, having had a history in Cardiothoracics. They clash over patient Seymour Orson, a man with Asperger's syndrome refusing urgent surgery. Jac is reported for negligence by Fran to Hanssen, and compiles a file of her mortality rates in theatre. This file is shown to a patient's relative who is supposed to undergo a revolutionary and untested procedure performed by Jac. When Jac is informed of the file, and performs the surgery successfully (although facing complications in theatre, which are observed by Hanssen), she confronts Fran. Jac is slapped by Fran in front of Hanssen, leading to her immediate suspension. It is later revealed that Fran and Jac had a past at St. Bartholomew's Foster Home, where a man named 'Yates' sexually assaulted the young girls. It is revealed by Fran (on a rooftop) that she was in fact assaulted by Yates, and Jac saw him do it. Jac apologises for what she did back then and promises to never turn away again, like she did before; however, security scare Fran who is hallucinating, and she falls off the roof. Jac, Guy and Hanssen all operate on her and Fran makes a speedy recovery. Jac later begins to notice the tension between Oliver and Zosia, and worries about how their personal feelings for each other may affect their work. She offers Zosia a fake internship in Edinburgh with immediate effect for a year, forcing Oliver to tell Zosia how he truly feels. Jac eventually walks in on them both kissing in the locker room, and is proud that her plan had succeeded. Hanssen later becomes concerned when Guy threatens his position as CEO. He asks Jac to recreate Elliot's invention of a malleable stent in order to take away funding from Guy's Neuro Centre plans. When the consultants of each ward are asked to vote between Hanssen and Guy, Jac (along with Ric Griffin and Serena Campbell) votes in favour of Hannsen. During the press conference regarding Jac's Digby Stent project, it is discovered that someone on Darwin has leaked details of its technology, and it has already been used in Berlin, and has failed a number of times. Jac is livid, presuming Zosia was the leak, but later finds out it was Guy in a bid for her to not receive funding. When new consultant, Matteo Rossini (Christian Vit) arrives, he develops an instant attraction to Jac. However, it is discovered that he is the one that plagiarised Jac's research, and made her stent with Guy's leaked knowledge. Jac learns she has an ovearian cyst, but refuses to have an operation to remove it. Shortly before performing a life-saving procedure on Jonny's brother Alastair (Andrew Rothney), Jac collapses and has to undergo urgent surgery performed by Derwood Thompson (Ben Hull) and Matteo. Matteo and Jac share a kiss in her office. He later asks her to accompany him to Italy and Mo persuades her to go. Jac learns Matteo is married and their relationship ends. Jac is demoted from her role as clinical lead of Darwin by Hanssen, who has been keeping a log on her misconducts. She had earlier performed unauthorised surgery on Fran Reynolds who was technically Matteo's patient after Jac passed on treating her, however, Fran pressured Jac into performing the surgery with threats of revealing the childhood abuse. Jac asks Jasmine Burrows (Lucinda Dryzek) to assist her in surgery in an attempt to keep it a secret from Matteo and others. Matteo found out during the surgery and chastised Jac before reporting to Hanssen. Jac later learns Jasmine is her younger sister and has her removed from Darwin. Jac, along with Oliver and Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden), is shot by Fredrik Johansson (Billy Postlethwaite), Hanssen's son. She is found by Sacha and John Gaskell (Paul McGann), who help to save her life. Jac experiences a lot of pain following the shooting, and agrees to let John operate on her to reduce her scar tissue and insert an implant containing stem cells. A month later, Jac develops an infection and collapses in her office. She is then placed into an induced coma. Once she wakes up, she has to go to theatre where John and Roxanna MacMillan (Hermione Gulliford) discover that she has sepsis. As they treat her, Jac goes into peri-arrest. Roxanna proceeds to go to theatre, despite Gaskell stating that Jac has just about got through the other operation. Jac goes into cardiac arrest on the table and nearly dies, but Roxanna, Hanssen and Meena Chowdhury (Salma Hoque) manage to save her.  Development  = Casting and introduction = Prior to her casting, Marcel had appeared in Holby City in an unrelated role, as a drug addict named Elinor. After joining the cast of Holby City as Jac, Marcel signed a three- year contract with the drama, securing her on the show until 2008. Marcel was introduced to the series alongside Luke Roberts and Tom Chambers, who portray cardiothoracic registrars Joseph Byrne and Sam Strachan, respectively. Jac is introduced during the episode titled \\"Bird on a Wire\\", which was broadcast on 22 November 2005. A writer from Inside Soap reported that Jac arrives at the hospital determined to impress consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie). She offers to help on a double amputation procedure and insists that Ric will be so impressed he will offer her a permanent role at Holby. Medical trainee Dean West (Paul Henshall) accidentally cuts Ric's hand and this puts him in a bad mood. Jac has to work harder to impress Ric as he insists he no longer needs her help. In two series twelve episodes, Cydney Dubavin-Hands played a teenage Jac in flashback scenes. Writers soon developed a rivalry between Jac and fellow registrar Diane Lloyd (Patricia Potter). The story sees the pair fight for the role of locum consultant, which Diane goes onto secure. A writer from the Liverpool Echo stated that Jac took credit for work Diane had done. They added \\"Diane and Jac's working relationship hasn't exactly been an easy one to date, and it doesn't look as if it's going to improve\\". The pair later argue over patient care. When a paroled murderer is admitted to Darwin ward, they disagree on the cause of his pain. Jac decides to take over the case and orders x-rays to confirm her diagnosis. She goes to see consultant Dan Clifford (Peter Wingfield) and complains about having to work alongside Diane. He sides with Diane and throws Jac's diagnosis in the bin. When Diane realises that Jac was correct about the man's condition she is forced to apologise. = Characterisation = According to the official Holby City website, Jac is \\"strong-minded\\" and forthright. Professionally, she is a highly ambitious \\"political player\\", determined to become a consultant and attain recognition for her surgical skills. She is willing to hurt others to achieve her goals, and has a \\"professional façade\\", developed as a result of pursuing a career in a male-dominated field. A BBC Online reporter thought that Jac's \\"determination to be brilliant might just kill her\\". Jac demonstrates a willingness to flout rules and endanger patients to advance her own career. Marcel liked Jac's original characterisation of a woman \\"who would gladly sell her soul to the devil in exchange for a better job\\". Bob Barrett, who portrays Sacha Levy in the drama, dubbed the character \\"Ms Darwin\\" after she is promoted to clinical lead of cardiothoracic ward, Darwin. Outside of work, Jac is \\"charming and hugely sociable\\". Placed in foster care by her mother aged twelve, she finds it difficult to form relationships due to an inability to commit and \\"let herself go\\". Her experience in foster care made Jac more independent as she believes that she cannot rely on other people. Marcel explained that Jac believes that \\"no one is ever going to fight for you so you just need to crack on and do it yourself and just get on with it basically!\\" Barrett was inspired by the exploration of Jac's characterisation and backstory when exploring his own character. Shortly after joining the cast, producers spoke to Marcel about turning the character of Jac into \\"a massive bitch\\", which excited her. The actress explained in June 2018 that Jac's nastier personality combined with the stories written for is the reason she has remained on Holby City. In 2008, Jac had firmly been established as a \\"rude\\" and \\"bitchy\\" character. Marcel told an Inside Soap reporter that \\"she's too honest for my liking. There's a fine line between being honest and rude. I'd want to hit her over the head!\\" Scriptwriter Patrick Homes found it easy to write stories for Jac due to her \\"defined\\" characterisation. Marcel reflected on her character's characterisation in 2015, stating that she enjoys how Jac \\"says the things that people wouldn't normally say, or would at least think about first\\". Three years later, the actress opined that Jac is more gentle than she was upon her introduction. She hoped that the character would toughen up, but expected her to experience some painful stories first. Though Jac rarely falls in love, she is not averse to using sexual manipulation to achieve her goals, for example she has had romances with several of her colleagues; consultant Nick Jordan (Michael French), who she let \\"too close and was burned\\", and foundation doctor Oliver Valentine (James Anderson). Noting this trait, television critic Jim Shelley described Jac as a \\"man- eating android\\". In 2011, writers planned to rejuvenate Jac's nasty persona. Producers created a medical story which leaves Jac conflicted in the face of treating an infant patient. When Jac is introduced to baby Freya who requires heart surgery, she behaves in her usual nasty manner. When Freya's mother abandons her, Jac bonds with the baby. Marcel told Katy Moon from Inside Soap that Jac relates to Freya because her mother also abandoned her. Jac operates on Freya and she nearly dies during the procedure. She said that \\"Jac's becoming attached\\" and when Jac saves her life \\"that's when the real bond develops\\". Marcel explained that Freya \\"has a big impact\\" on Jac and it was the start of a long-running story in which her character changes. In 2019, Marcel assessed that Jac is still mean but also does \\"so much good for people\\" via her job. She explained that Jac has had a \\"hard life and come out the other side.\\" She added that Jac is a fighter because she carries on through the bad and wanted viewers to be inspired by Jac's driven persona. She later noted that Jac is \\"a little bit of what we all want to be - a bit more honest and more open\\". =Relationship with Joseph Byrne= Producers paired Jac with fellow registrar Joseph. Jac originally only slept with Joseph in a bid to further her career. She had previously been involved in an affair with Joseph's father Lord Byrne (Ronald Pickup). He later moves on with ward sister Faye Morton (Patsy Kensit), which causes a feud. Jac and Joseph later sleep together and tricks Joseph into believing that she is pregnant with his child. When Faye discovers the truth she breaks-up with him. Kensit said that \\"he's done the most unforgivable thing\\". Joseph manages to convince Faye to marry him, but she soon takes a romantic interest in Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow). Jac continues to interfere in Joseph's relationship, becoming wary of Faye and Linden and Kensit stated that Jac had the right to be suspicious. Jac and Joseph briefly reunited prior to Roberts' departure from the series. Marcel told Inside Soap's Moon that \\"Jac will always love Joseph.\\" When Roberts left he made Marcel a promise that he would return to the show if she ever chose to leave, so that Jac and Joseph could leave together. Marcel later assessed that Jac gave up on a ready made family with Joseph and Harry. Roberts told Victoria Wilson from What's on TV that Jac and Joseph's relationship was \\"tumultuous\\" and \\"very passionate\\" despite Joseph's treatment of Jac. He concluded that Jac and Joseph class each other as the \\"one that got away\\". In 2019, Roberts returned to the show for one episode as Joseph. Marcel was surprised that Roberts agreed to return having previously stating that he would only return amid a departure for Jac. Marcel told Laura Jayne-Tyler from Inside Soap that even after ten years, Joseph is still \\"the love of her life\\". This is because they parted on good terms and Jac has constantly compared subsequent partners with Joseph. He returns with Faye and Marcel believed that Jac seeing them together again \\"is one of the most difficult things she has ever had to do.\\" Joseph is at the hospital to support Faye through a heart transplant. Roberts stated that Joseph's heart has always belonged to Jac. He described it as \\"an eternal love that will never go away.\\" So Joseph is on a \\"rescue mission\\" to save Faye, but ultimately \\"Jac's magnetic pull hasn't weakened\\" and they end up revisiting old feelings. He later told Sophie Dainty from Digital Spy that \\"he's so drawn to her – he is almost looking for an excuse. Otherwise, why is he there? He's nervous and it's a collection of emotions. He doesn't know what to do with it.\\" =Assault and murder investigation= In September 2007, writers made Jac the victim of an attempted sexual assault. In the episode titled \\"Friends Reunited\\", Alan Clooney (James Weber Brown) is admitted to the Darwin ward following a car accident. He is instantly attracted to Jac and enjoys receiving medical attention from her. Marcel told Katy Moon from Inside Soap that Jac only gives Alan \\"professional attention\\" but he \\"gets the wrong idea\\". Jac is preoccupied with another patient Graham Fenton (Ben Jones), whom she recognises from her school days. This aggravates Alan and makes him jealous. When Graham reveals that he now works for a US pharmaceutical company, she forges a romantic interest in him. Marcel explained that Jac used to bully Graham for being overweight and suffering from acne. He is now good looking and successful, and \\"in Jac's mind, the fact that he works for a pharmaceutical company in America also represents an opportunity for her to further her career.\\" Graham is fooling Jac to enact revenge for the bullying ordeal she inflicted on him. When she meets with him for a date, he kisses her and reveals he is married with children. Marcel said that Graham \\"just wanted to embarrass her\\" in public. Alan witnesses the incident and takes an opportunity to goad Jac. He speaks to her \\"menacingly\\" and attacks her until she loses consciousness, then drags her into bushes. Unbeknownst to Jac, registrar Lola Griffin (Sharon D. Clarke) had been watching Alan around Jac and suspected he was a rapist. Lola telephones Jac when she notices Jac and Alan are both missing from the ward. The ring tone rouses Jac into consciousness and she tries to fight of Alan. He tries to sexually assault her but Lola arrives in time and hits Alan with a metal bar. The attack leaves Jac at her \\"lowest ebb\\" and Marcel said that her character \\"is sickened\\" with Lola because she knew Alan posed a serious threat. In March 2008, Alan is reintroduced into the show and is later found stabbed to death. This story crossed over into the show's sister series HolbyBlue. The episode focuses on the murder investigation and police interviews conducted with Holby City characters. Jac is arrested on suspicion of murder, having earlier threatened to kill Alan in-front of her colleagues. Marcel told an Inside Soap reporter that Jac \\"finds it hard\\" because the evidence suggests she killed him, adding that \\"she has no credible alibi and her fingerprints are on the murder weapon.\\" Jac pleads her innocence when she is presented with the evidence. The actress sympathised with Jac because \\"she fully believes in her abilities as a surgeon and wouldn't jeopardise that.\\" When the police interview Joseph, he does not defend Jac and claims that she is capable of murder. Marcel said that Jac should be shocked by Joseph's statement but \\"she has a history with him, so he probably believes that she's capable of anything.\\" Marcel told a BBC Online reporter that fans would \\"love the storyline\\" because it features \\"Jac getting her \\". She concluded that \\"you get to see another side to Jac in this episode – a side that she never shows in Holby City – so that should be really interesting to fans of the show.\\" Marcel had a \\"fantastic time\\" working on the HolbyBlue set and liked how different the set worked in comparison to the Holby City one. =Feud with Faye Morton= A feud between Jac and Faye (portrayed by Patsy Kensit, pictured) was established. Writers developed a feud with ward sister Faye which has dramatic consequences for Jac. She is jealous that Faye has begun a relationship with Joseph. Maeve Quigley from Daily Mirror observed that Faye had become Jac's enemy by February 2008, adding that her \\"main hobby is scoring points off Faye.\\" When Faye takes time off work for a dentist appointment, Jac becomes suspicious. Faye is actually attending the police exhumation of her ex-husband's dead body. Jac realises that Faye has lied about her whereabouts when she witnesses her with the police. Jac visits vicar Kevin Mathers (Paul Opacic) who reveals that he \\"can see the good\\" in her. This prompts Jac to hatch a scheme and creates a new friendly persona. She soon covers for Faye to keep her secret hidden and takes the blame for a small fire ward sister Kyla Tyson (Rakie Ayola) causes. Jac carries on pretending to be Faye's friend for months until a culmination to the plot aired in June 2008. Faye's stepson Carl Hewson (Fergus O'Donnell) arrives at the hospital demanding money to pay off loan sharks. He blackmails Faye and Jac spots an opportunity to sabotage things. Marcel told Moon that \\"Jac appears to help Faye out - but being the 'nice' person she is, Jac's looking to trip her up.\\" She convinces Joseph and Faye to not give Carl more money, which results in the loan sharks attacking Carl. He is taken to an operating theatre where Jac fails to save his life. Marcel explained that both Joseph and Faye hold Jac responsible for Carl's death. This makes Jac more determined to expose Faye as a liar. Marcel said that Jac still loves Joseph and wants him back because \\"in her eyes Faye has stolen him from her.\\" Jac becomes suspicious of secretive Faye as she gets into a taxi. Jac follows the vehicle on her motorcycle and tracks Faye down to a nursing home. Faye's secret son is being cared for in the home and Jac cannot wait to tell Joseph the truth. Marcel said that Jac is determined to expose Faye and speeds off on her motorbike. Jac's recklessness has severe consequences when she crashes and is hurled from her motorbike. Off-screen Marcel believed that motorbikes are unsafe. She used to ride them but ceased after she had accidents and some of her friends died in separate motorbike crashes. This meant that the scenes required a stunt double to portray the crash scenes. To add realism, Marcel was attached to the back of a moving lorry and filmed to give the impression of her riding the motorbike. Marcel explained that after the stunt double had finished their role, \\"it's my crumpled body lying on the ground at the end of the episode.\\" The actress concluded that Jac is taken to hospital and it is \\"touch-and-go whether she'll pull through\\". Joseph and Faye separate following her affair with Linden. This leaves Jac and Joseph free to rekindle their romance. Faye gives birth to his child Harry, while detained in a mental health facility. The events force Joseph to break-up with Jac. But when Faye refuses to associate with Joseph, he apologises to Jac and they get back together. Kensit and Roberts reprised their roles for a single episode in 2019 to coincide with the show's twentieth anniversary. Writers used the unresolved tension between the characters to develop \\"a playfulness and a real strength and humour\\" in their portrayal. Kensit observed that the \\"bitchiness\\" between the characters is \\"heightened\\" in Faye's return, which she liked as she felt it added to the episode. Faye returns in need of a heart transplant and has to be admitted to Holby City Hospital when a rainstorm hits. Kensit said that Faye wants to avoid Jac and the hospital, but it becomes \\"the only option\\". On the moment Jac sees Faye again, Marcel commented, \\"Jac's feisty spirit certainly comes tumbling out!\\" The pair do not want Jac to perform surgery on Faye, but understand that she is the best in her field, which would give Faye the best chance of survival. When Joseph returns, it emerges that he and Faye are still married. He asks Jac to perform the operation and she agrees. Roberts told Wilson (What's on TV) that Joseph and Jac have \\"enormous underlying respect for each other as professionals\\", which means he can recognise her excellence. Marcel explained that Jac feels that she has to agree because Joseph asks. She added that Jac now \\"can hold that over Faye for a very long time\\". = Friendship with Sacha Levy = Then-script editor Simon Harper suggested pairing Jac with registrar Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett) following his introduction as the characters have contrasting personalities. On the actors' first day working together, they filmed two more scenes than planned as they were working so quickly. The characters remained paired together for six months. Barrett thought the characters were friends because with Jac, Sacha can \\"[see] straight through what everyone else struggles with\\" and understands that Jac has \\"the greatest heart\\". Likewise, with Sacha, Jac speaks to him in a different manner to everyone else, and together, they trust each other a lot. Marcel believed that Jac and Sacha should be romantically involved because \\"they are like yin and yang\\". She added that it was \\"a shame\\" Sacha loved ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley) instead. The actress later spoke again of her wish for the pair to be together. She said that they would \\"make such a hilarious couple\\" but did not think it would ever happen. Sacha and Chrissie later prepare to marry, but Jac notices that Chrissie is having second thoughts. She warns Chrissie not to hurt Sacha and Hobley explained that Jac believes \\"if anyone deserves to be happy more than anyone she's ever met, it's Sacha\\". Marcel and Barrett formed an idea that Jac and Sacha should live together in an unseen flat with viewers only seeing the characters speaking about home life. In 2018, Sacha is featured in an issue-led story about depression and male mental health. Jac becomes involved in Sacha's rehabilitation process after he tries to kill himself. Barrett dubbed Jac \\"Sacha's guardian angel\\" and she is saddened to hear about his battle, but is also \\"furious\\" that he did not speak to her or his former partner, Essie Harrison (Kaye Wragg). Jac then comforts Sacha and tells him that he will move into her home. Barrett explained that this would aid Sacha's recovery, but not complete it. In a 2019 story, Jac has to perform emergency surgery on Sacha, but has to fight for theatre space against Connie. Marcel explained that Jac \\"would have fought to the death for Sacha\\". =Feud with Sahira Shah= In 2011, producers introduced actress Laila Rouass as registrar Sahira Shah and another sparring partner for Jac. Writers pitted the characters against each other via a story where they compete for the same consultancy role. Sahira is portrayed as a talented and able surgeon who rivals Jac. Marcel explained that Jac's professional feuds had traditionally been against male characters, but Jac now had to face a female who \\"has it all\\". Sahira has a husband and children but still manages to excel in her career. This provokes Jac because she will not let \\"someone like that beat her.\\" Jac believes the only reason she secured a job at Holby City hospital is because she is an old friend of CEO Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry). When a patient dies suddenly during an operation carried out by Jac, Sahira helps her find evidence about what has happened. Marcel said that this makes Jac wary because she \\"fears it's an opportunity for Sahira to stitch her up.\\" Marcel noted that Jac is not opposed to using Sahira for \\"team work\\" to achieve \\"great surgery\\". They cooperate and discover that the patient had been involved in a suicide pact. She caused a motorbike crash and ingested blood thinning chemicals to sabotage any surgical efforts to save her life. She told a Daily Mirror journalist that Jac and Sahira have \\"a tense relationship\\" filled with \\"lots of one liners\\" and is kept is solely work related. Rouass thought that the rivalry never got \\"too serious\\" and the \\"catty comments\\" gave the story a \\"fun element\\". She told a reporter from the Bath Chronicle that \\"they're both very competitive and focused and both want the same outcome but they do it in different ways and have different approaches to their job.\\" Rouass added that the characters are both \\"exceptional\\" at work and actually respect one another. Rouass told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that while Jac and Sahira shared a \\"silent respect\\" over work, the characters are \\"completely different\\". Sahira \\"kills people with kindness\\" rather than being sly. She added that Jac makes Sahira feel \\"threatened\\". =Jonny Maconie and pregnancy= While attending a people skills course, Jac has a one-night stand with Jonny Maconie (Michael Thomson), who is later introduced to the series as a regular character. Jac is under the impression that Jonny is a neurosurgeon, so she is surprised to learn that he is really a nurse and about to start working at Holby as part of the transplant team. Thompson said Jonny is \\"like the kryptonite to Jac's super ice maiden.\\" He is not intimidated by Jac and she does not know what to make of him, leading to a \\"fiery\\" relationship. Jac and Jonny break up after a few months, but Thomson believed there was unfinished business between them. He explained, \\"She's messed with his head, and he wants to fix her. He wants to prove to her that it's all right to be warm and love people.\\" Jac and Jonny briefly get back together, however, when Jac learns that her former boyfriend Joseph Byrne is getting married, she initially takes her frustration out on Jonny and later has sex with paediatrician Sean Dolan (Wil Johnson). Jac leaves for Japan to study some new medical techniques, and on her return she tells Jonny that she loves him. Thomson said that the declaration and her show of commitment \\"blows Jonny's mind and takes their relationship in a new direction.\\" While performing a preliminary procedure on a patient, Jac experiences some pain and Jonny worries that it could be related to her kidney. Knowing that she donated one to her estranged mother, he is worried that she could be in danger if the remaining one fails. Jac orders some tests, but they come back clear. She is later forced to abandon her patient during surgery, as she is overcome by pain again and has to lie down. Jac meets with her consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Derwood Thompson (Ben Hull), who informs her that she has endometriosis, a condition which greatly reduces her chances of conceiving. Jac keeps her diagnosis from Jonny, knowing that he wants a family, while he surpsises her by asking her to move in with him. Thomson pointed out that it was not unusual for Jac to hide something from Jonny, because she had built up many defences over the years when she felt scared. A \\"bitter row\\" breaks out between Jac and Jonny over her treatment of Tara Lo (Jing Lusi), who was affected by her brain tumour while assisting Jac during surgery. Jonny disagrees with Jac's decision to ask Tara to leave the theatre, and she ends up slapping him across the face. Jonny then ends their relationship, leaving Jac feeling isolated. Following Tara's funeral, Jac and Jonny have a one-night stand, but they both tell Mo Effanga (Chizzy Akudolu) separately that they do not plan on getting back together. Jac later learns that she is pregnant with Jonny's baby. When Jonny finds out that Jac told Mo about the baby before him, he confronts Jac, who is overcome with \\"uncharacteristic\\" emotion and bursts into tears. Jonny later performs an ultrasound scan on Jac and they get to see their baby for the first time. During Jac's 20-week scan, she and Jonny are informed that their baby has a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, meaning it has a 50% chance of survival after birth. They also told that further tests need to be carried out, before they can talk about their options. = Temporary departure = On 11 August 2014, it was announced that Marcel was pregnant with her first child and that Jac would take a break from Holby City. Jac exits in the seventeenth series episode \\"Go the Distance\\", originally broadcast on 14 April 2015, after reuniting with Jonny. Thomson also decided to leave the show to return to theatrical projects. Thomson explained that viewers wished for a \\"happy ending\\" for Jac, which happens through her and Jonny's departure. He thought that it was a perfect conclusion to Jac and Jonny's relationship as they establish their family life. The actor added that Jac and Jonny have realised \\"what they mean to each other\\". Marcel and Thomson made a guest appearance together in the series 17 episode \\"Spiral Staircases\\", originally broadcast on 23 June 2015. Before Marcel took maternity leave, her co-star, Paul Bradley, decided to leave his role as Elliot Hope. Marcel asked producers to return for his exit episode before she left and producers agreed as they also shared an interest in arranging this. A show trailer previewing Jac's appearance was released on 16 September 2015, and the appearance features in the series 17 episode \\"At First I Was Afraid\\", originally broadcast on 22 September 2015. Jac mentions that she and Jonny have separated. Holby City series producer Simon Harper clarified that their split was \\"perfectly amiable\\" and they are sharing parental responsibility of Emma. He also pointed out even though the characters tried a relationship, their alternative personalities meant it would not succeed. Marcel expanded on the breakdown of the relationship, stating that Jac dislikes how Jonny did not aspire to be \\"anything other than a nurse\\". The actress opined that Jac is better as a single woman. She also added that the failure of the relationship allows Jac to \\"toughen up\\" and return to her meaner personality. Harper confirmed in October 2015 that Jac would return during the following month, and Jac returns in the eighteenth series episode \\"A Delicate Truth\\", originally broadcast on 24 November 2015. Harper revealed that Jac would return \\"with a bang\\" as she reclaims her status as the head of Darwin ward and reassesses the ward's structure and staffing. Marcel added, \\"She's in full-on Jac mode now and demands to know exactly what's going on.\\" Jac immediately decides to make her junior doctors, Oliver and Zosia March (Camilla Arfwedson), prove themselves by handing them bad jobs. Marcel explained that this method works and gives Jac the best doctors on her cardiothoracic team. Following her return, there is more emphasis on Jac's bitchy personality, something which Marcel also wanted to reinforce. She thought that the character had proved popular and remained on the drama due to her villainous characterisation. Marcel struggled to readjust to the schedule of working on Holby City after being on maternity leave. = Matteo Rossini = Christian Vit was cast as Matteo Rossini, a cardiothoracic consultant, in 2016. Matteo was introduced as a rival and possible love interest for Jac. Jac instantly dislikes Matteo and clashes with him when he begins to work on her patient. Vit explained that Matteo would prefer to challenge Jac's behaviour than leave her alone. Jac then discovers that Matteo was in the team who stole her Stent research, infuriating her. Matteo tells Jac that he did not intend to \\"steal\\" her project, but she does not believe him and claims one of Matteo's ideas for their patient. Vit pointed out that Matteo \\"immediately realises what kind of character Jac is\\", but is also fascinated by her. Writers placed the characters in a \\"cat and mouse\\" game as Matteo tries to impress Jac with his \\"Italian charm\\". Vit commented, \\"With Jac, he knows he'll always be on thin ice!\\" = Fletch = Holby City series producer Kate Hall announced plans in August 2017 to pair Jac with director of nursing Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw). Marcel and Walkinshaw previously portrayed a couple in The Bill and were pleased to work with each other. When Walkinshaw joined Holby City, writers inserted a reference to the actors' history in an episode. Marcel had previously called for Walkinshaw to be introduced into the show in 2011, so Jac could have a romance with a character he played. Despite this, when Jac and Fletch were paired together, the actors were not pleased as they did not feel the characters were well-suited. Hall wanted to pair the characters because she liked the connection between Marcel and Walkinshaw, calling it \\"palpable\\", \\"delicious and electric\\". She compared the matching to characters Maddie Hayes (Cybill Shepherd) and David Addison (Bruce Willis) in Moonlighting and Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) and Reggie Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) in Charade. Marcel enjoyed playing the Moonlighting comparison, but opined that Walkinshaw is the Maddie to her David. Walkinshaw identified how Jac and Fletch have contrasting personalities and opined that the pairing would be \\"interesting\\" as Fletch is not afraid to challenge Jac's formidable behaviour. He added that Fletch would not be \\"intimidated\\" by Jac. Walkinshaw explained that this is refreshing for Jac as she is accustomed to \\"having a man standing opposite her desk, to attention, while she's sitting telling them off and letting them know exactly how the land lies.\\" The actor added that although Fletch finds Jac scary, he is not afraid to challenge how she speaks to him or his nursing staff, reminding her that she is not their boss. He also looked forward to filming scenes where they clash, and scenes where they bond. The story begins in the nineteenth series when Jac assists Fletch with a patient. The story was filmed on the AAU set, where Fletch is based, which Marcel enjoyed as she rarely films away from Darwin ward. Jac later uncharacteristically takes \\"her guard down\\" around Fletch and grieves for her recently-murdered half-sister, Jasmine Burrows (Lucinda Dryzek), which strengthens her bond with Fletch. The characters continue to bond as Fletch moves to Darwin ward and they work together more. On their bond, a What's on TV reporter noted, \\"it's obvious Jac has eyes for Fletch\\". Marcel took a three-month break from the drama in 2018, pausing the budding relationship. When Jac returns, it is apparent that Fletch has missed her, which Marcel liked. The actress thought it was clear that the characters had strong feelings for each other. Jac does not return for a relationship with Fletch, which disappoints him. However, he is still supportive when she prepares for her operation. Reflecting on the pairing in August 2019, Marcel explained that it would not be viable as Jac would \\"hurt him and then everybody would be upset that she hurt him\\". = Shooting and recovery problems = After the shooting Jac takes time off work to recuperate from her injuries. While she is away scar tissue forms and begins to cause Jac more pain. Professor John Gaskell (Paul McGann) recommends that Jac takes part in his dodgy stem-cell treatment trial and he will perform the operation. Marcel told from Jayne- Tyler from Inside Soap that upon Jac's return \\"she seems healthy and fit when she returns, but she's masking quite a lot of pain.\\" Jac \\"thought long and hard\\" about her options and she decides that Gaskell's plan is her best chance. Marcel described portraying Jac's difficult year of recovery as exhausting and a \\"tough year\\". She explained that she would often take Jac's emotional baggage home with her as she learned lines. = Mental health = Producers decided to tackle mental health with the character in 2019. Jane Wallbank, the show's series producer, explained that Jac's professional and personal lives would place her under pressure, especially as she tries to prioritise her relationship with Emma (Darcey Burke). Marcel noted that as a long-term \\"strongest character\\" in the show, Jac appears \\"infallible and unbreakable\\" through her many dramas, but it has taken a toll on her mind and body. Holby City had previously tackled mental health with Sacha and Marcel thought it was \\"important\\" to portray female mental health and how women can struggle to maintain a job and family life. The story coincides with the guest returns of Joseph and Elliot, two important figures in Jac's life. Wallbank told Dainty (Digital Spy) that she wanted their returns to impact Jac's story. Joseph returns at a point when Jac begins to struggle and Elliot's return occurs as the plot climaxes. She also praised Marcel's performances as Jac as \\"heart wrenching\\", and confirmed that the story would feature on-location scenes. Marcel was excited about the story and how Joseph and Elliot's returns tied into it. She called it \\"personal to [her] and for [her] character\\". Bradley labelled the storyline \\"intense and vital\\" with \\"loads of twists and turns\\". Marcel thought that the story could signify \\"the end of Jac\\" as not many characters would be able to recover from it. She added that the story would \\"frighten\\" viewers, but also \\"open [their] eyes\\" and encourage them to talk about their feelings. The plot was previewed in the show's seasonal trailer, released on 4 September 2019. Marcel struggled filming the story and named it \\"the hardest thing I've ever had to do\\". The actress suffers from depression, anxiety and depersonalisation disorder and in 2016, she had a breakdown on the show's set as a result of this. Knowing this, Marcel was surprised that the producers had created this story for her character. She felt \\"frightened\\" and \\"very sad\\" to be approached about the plot and had to question whether she wanted to do it. The actress received lots of encouragement from her agent and the producers, specifically Kate Oates, the Head of Continuing Drama at BBC Studios. Oates wanted to give Marcel the opportunity to read scripts early and be involved in the writing process. The pair shared a long conversation where Marcel expressed her concerns. Upon speaking to her husband, Marcel realised how important it was to portray the issue. The actress used her own experience to accurately portray Jac's story and was involved in the writing process. She was also granted a day in therapy each week while portraying the story. One of Marcel's main concerns was that she would be putting her mental health at risk by portraying Jac's story, but decided that as long as she stayed healthy, she could do the plot \\"justice\\". Elements of the story begin when Jac resigns from her clinical lead position after choosing to focus on herself and her family. Jac's decision marks a long-term change in direction for the character. Marcel explained that Jac is \\"a lonely person\\" whose life revolves around her work. When Emma arrives on Darwin with Jonny's pregnant fiancée Stacey Clarkson (Emily Bowker), Jac is confronted with how she has become an \\"absent parent\\" in Emma's life. She consequently decides to hand over clinical lead duties to Kian Madani (Ramin Karimloo). Marcel enjoyed seeing the \\"softer side\\" of Jac, but did not want to stray from \\"the Jac we all love to hate!\\" The actress enjoyed working with her Darwin co-stars - Karimloo, Belinda Owusu (Nicky McKendrick) and Amy Lennox (Chloe Godard) - and commented, \\"I have the best team, we get the most fantastic storylines - Darwin wins hands down every time!\\" After attending Jonny and Stacey's wedding, Jac returns and is surprised to see Joseph and Faye at the hospital. Joseph's appearance proves confronting for Jac, who has to \\"face up to her everlasting love for Joseph\\". Following Joseph's return, Jac takes herself away from the hospital and the character is absent from the show for a few weeks. Writers created issues in Jac's home life through her relationship with Emma. After Stacey informs Jac that she and Jonny are moving to Edinburgh and that Jonny wants custody of Emma, Jac suffers a panic attack. Marcel told Wilson (What's on TV) that combined with the past few years, \\"Jac's life is in chaos\\", which would build towards \\"something dramatic\\". Jac eventually decides to withdraw custody of her daughter, having become \\"convinced that her daughter is better off without her\\". The decision came after Jac finds Emma playing with hospital equipment and consequently shows her the hospital mortuary. Frightened, Emma runs away and is nearly hit by an ambulance. Marcel and her husband found this scene \\"distressing\\" to watch. Jac then has a \\"heartbreaking\\" talk with Emma where she informs her of her decision. Marcel explained that Jac is acting in a \\"quite unusual\\" manner, and rejecting support from anyone, which stems from her lonely childhood. The actress said, \\"She's only ever been able to rely on herself, so it's very hard for her to hand the reins over to someone else and trust them with personal stuff.\\" Paul Bradley reprises his role as Elliot for the story. Jac and her mental health story were central to the show's 1000th episode. In the narrative, the hospital marks its 150-year milestone and Jac performs her 1000th transplant. Bradley's return stint also begins in the episode and the actor commented, \\"There are real fireworks in the story and it gets pretty hairy!\\" The episode was filmed on the hottest day of the year, but the episode was set in November so they had to appear cold. Marcel noted that Elliot's return opens \\"Jac's heart a little bit\\" as well as \\"some old wounds\\" because Jac views Elliot as the \\"father she never had\\". She also opined that Jac would still be struggling if Elliot had not have returned, but his return has \\"sped up the process for Jac\\" due to his own health issues. Elliot notices a change in Jac's attitude and tries to understand her better. Bradley explained that based on his own struggle with mental health, Elliot recognises that Jac is not well. Wallbank said that although \\"he and Jac need each other the most\\", the story focus heavily on \\"whether they will actually reach out to one another before it's too late\\". Bradley added that both Jac and Elliot are \\"very good at concealing what is upsetting them\\", which they recognise in each other. The story then shifted focus to Jac's professional life as she treats Stage 4 cancer patient, Sandra Jackson (Vicky Entwistle). Jac goes against the advice of Elliot and clinical lead Kian and offers Sandra an alternative operation, which has more risks. Elliot becomes worried that a struggling Jac is tackling too much. Writers killed-off Sandra and used her death to add to Jac's fears that she is failing as a mother and surgeon, growing \\"paranoid that everyone's out to get her\\". On Jac's breakdown, Marcel said, \\"She's the queen of the comeback and very strong but we all have our breaking point.\\" She added that she liked exposing Jac's vulnerable nature. Following Sandra's death, Jac has to face a mortality and morbidity review, where some of her colleagues question whether she was fit to perform surgery. Having investigated the surgery, Elliot asks whether Jac is suffering with a mental health issue and also reveals that he is ill and in need of a high-risk operation. Writers intertwined the stories of Jac and Kian to lead into the next stages of their stories. When Kian's girlfriend, Bea Kaminski (Rosalind Halstead), is readmitted onto Darwin for surgery, she begs Kian for an alternative surgery, so he asks the \\"increasingly-irrational\\" Jac, who refuses. In surgery, Kian risks his career and sabotages the operation so that Bea can have the surgery she wants. Once the operation is complete, Jac is \\"incandescent with rage\\" and confronts Kian, which is witnessed by new CEO Max McGerry (Jo Martin), who reprimands them both. Having witnessed Jac's successful operation on Bea, Elliot decides to ask Jac to perform his surgery, despite protests from Fletch, who does not believe she is well enough. Aware that she is struggling, Jac decides to confide in Fletch, but they are interupted by his girlfriend, Ange Godard (Dawn Steele); Jac then decides not to speak to Fletch. Marcel explained that Jac feels uncomfortable sharing her feelings because she has grown up independently and learnt not to trust or rely on other people. The story reaches a climax when Jac suffers a mental breakdown on the day of Elliot's operation. Marcel pointed out that the operation marks \\"the straw that breaks the camel's back\\" for Jac. She told Tyler (Inside Soap) that \\"there's only so much you can take before you break\\", which has happened to Jac. Marcel thought that Jac's history combined with the idea of losing Elliot and not seeing Emma contributed to her character's breakdown. In the build-up to the surgery, Jac begins to lack focus, suffering \\"absentee moments\\" and not remembering what she is doing. Despite this, Jac starts to perform surgery, however, when something goes wrong, she loses focus and suffers a breakdown. Marcel commented, \\"She's cracked. It's happened.\\" The actress explained that Jac \\"doesn't know how to control herself and she just loses it\\". As she walks out of theatre, Jac injures her colleagues, but can only focus on if Elliot will die. Jac flees the hospital to the car park with Emma and they are followed by Fletch. Publicly, Jac then has a \\"very emotional and overwhelming breakdown\\". The scene was filmed in one take and Marcel warned Walkinshaw that he had to get it correct first time. Marcel hit Walkinshaw multiple times during the scene. To make the scene realistic, Marcel did not rehearse and did not consider different ways of portraying the breakdown. Therefore, Walkinshaw had to fit his lines in wherever he could and had to reposition Marcel during her breakdown so that she was facing the camera. Marcel praised Walkinshaw for his work on the scenes and for helping her mental health off-screen too. Due to the nature of the breakdown scene, Burke was not permitted to be included for the breakdown. They then re-shot the scenes where Jac appears less upset to include Emma. Marcel found it \\"horrendous\\" to film Jac's breakdown as it felt realistic for her. She revealed that to make her portrayal realistic, she had to revisit her own troubles and replicate a breakdown. For filming the breakdown, Marcel did not have any makeup applied or her hair styled. The actress stated that she struggles to watch the breakdown scene and while she is \\"extremely proud\\", it does \\"upset [her] greatly\\". Focus was then moved to the aftermath of Jac's breakdown and her recovery. On the aftermath, Marcel teased, \\"Life is going to get significantly worse for Jac before it gets better and I'm not sure where it will leave her.\\" The actress observed that Jac is \\"at a really critical point in her life\\". Advanced spoilers, released on 21 November 2019, revealed that Jac would receive treatment in a Psychiatric Unit, where she would be visited by Fletch, Sacha and Elliot, dubbed the \\"three wise men\\". Marcel explained that Jac has a good relationship with Fletch, Sacha and Elliot because while \\"they don't let her get away with anything\\", they also understand and respect Jac, which makes Jac \\"[love] them and [respect] them\\". Following her breakdown, Jac is sectioned at a secure psychiatric unit, but does not believe she is unwell. Marcel pointed out that Jac \\"feels like everybody else is to blame\\". Fletch is the first person to visit Jac and she rejects him as she blames him for calling the psychiatric team and having Emma removed from her. Afterwards, Sacha visits her, but she blames him for not being there to help her and hits him. Upon Barrett's request, Marcel hit him for real, but they did not tell anyone as insurance purposes would have prevented it from happening. Elliot then visits Jac and Marcel told Wilson (What's on TV) that Elliot's \\"beautiful soul and calming nature\\" helps Jac to soften. She added that Elliot just talks to Jac where others have told her that she is unwell, which helps Jac begin her recovery. Marcel was keen for Jac's recovery to take time and for her not to return to work quickly. She was also unsure about whether Jac could continue with her life without \\"drastically\\" changing it. After filming Jac's sectioning episode, Marcel took three weeks of leave as she felt that she was in a \\"really tired, dark place\\" and needed to recover. Upon Jac's return, writers reintroduced Kian into the story as he becomes a support for Jac. Marcel confirmed the development in an interview with Filiz Mustafa of Digital Spy, noting that the pair share a backstory through their time at university. = Other appearances = Alongside her appearances in Holby City, Marcel has played Jac in the show's sister shows, HolbyBlue and Casualty. Jac appears in the opening episode of HolbyBlue second series, first broadcast in 2008. Marcel first appears in Casualty for one episode, originally aired in February 2016, during its thirty series to coincide with the appearance of Sam Strachan (Chambers). She later makes cameo appearances in Casualty thirtieth anniversary episode, originally broadcast in August 2016, and an episode of the thirty-first series, originally broadcast in September 2016. Kate Hall, the then-series producer, confirmed in August 2017 that Marcel would reprise her role in Casualty for two episodes, and Jac appears in two episodes of series 32, first broadcast in February 2018, where she is involved in a storyline with Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). Producers of Holby City and Casualty planned a crossover event for the shows in 2018, prominently featuring Jac and Casualty character Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), who formerly appeared in Holby City. Executive producer Simon Harper explained that both casts would be featured \\"striving heroically against the odds in two episodes of pure, nail-biting, taut, emotional medical drama.\\" The episode was filmed in November 2018 and first broadcast in March 2019. Marcel reprises her role as Jac again in a thirty- fourth series of Casualty, first broadcast in August 2019. The character stars opposite consultant Dylan Keogh (William Beck) and nurse David Hide (Jason Durr) as she operates on David's teenage son, Oliver Hide (Harry Collett). Reception Marcel has been nominated for several awards for her portrayal of Jac. She received consecutive \\"Best Actress\\" longlist nominations at the 2009 and 2010 TV Choice Awards, and later in 2010, was longlisted for the \\"Best Drama Performance\\" accolade at the National Television Awards, alongside her co-star Roberts. At the 2017 Inside Soap Awards, Marcel received a longlist nomination for Best Drama Star, while Jasmine's death received a longlist nomination for Best Drama Storyline. Two years later, she won the Best Drama Star accolade. She was shocked to have won and praised the audience's \\"commitment\\" to Holby City. Marcel was nominated again at the 2020 awards. For her portrayal of Jac, Marcel was nominated for Best Soap Actor (Female) at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards; she came in seventh place with 6.4% of the total votes. An Inside Soap reporter's first impressions of Jac were that she is a \\"leather-clad biker\\" and \\"feisty surgeon\\". Jac became so popular that viewers created a fan site for the character. In 2008, Marcel declared \\"it's sweet that they love Jac enough to dedicate a website to her - considering what a bitch she is!\\" Katy Moon of Inside Soap said \\"over the years, Jac Naylor has had many adversaries\\", \\"is used to playing dirty\\" and \\"is known for her ruthless streak.\\" Her colleague, Laura-Jayne Tyler, described the character as \\"fearsome\\", the \\"Queen of Holby City\\", and \\"Holby formidable cardio queen\\". Tyler called Jac's breakdown \\"powerful scenes that Holby viewers won't forget in a long time.\\" Series producer Kate Hall noticed that non-romantic pairings, such as Jac and Sacha, were more popular than romantic pairings. Sophie Blackman, writing for the Daily Star, labelled Jac a \\"stern surgeon\\", while Susanna Galton of the Daily Mirror called Jac a \\"uptight heart consultant\\" and a \\"frosty-faced, hard-as-nails doc who viewers have grown to love\\". Victoria Wilson from What's on TV branded Jac the show's \\"resident ice queen\\", and called the love triangle between Jac, Joseph and Faye one of Holby City most \\"gripping love triangle[s]\\". She also dubbed Jac and Joseph's romance as \\"one of the medical drama's greatest ever love stories\\". When Jac resigns as clinical lead, Wilson wrote, \\"Holby City fans probably can't imagine anyone in charge of Darwin ward over fiery surgeon Jac Naylor.\\" Her colleague, Elaine Reilly, described Jac as a \\"cutting-edge surgeon\\", \\"super\\" and \\"abrupt\\". She liked the character's witty remarks and created a list of her favourites from 2019. Reilly said that Jac and Faye meeting again created \\"quite the reunion – full of bile, backbiting and ferocious one-liners\\". She also enjoyed the character's interactions with Dylan Keogh, writing, \\"fans of Jac and Dylan [...] are in for a treat as these two equally abrupt medics bump heads!\\" Sue Haasler, writing for the Metro, praised the \\"incredible\\" working relationship between Marcel and Roberts. She wrote, \\"They showed us the history of Jac and Joseph – the passion and the pain alike – in their facial expressions, the yearning in their eyes as they looked at each other.\\" Likewise, Dainty (Digital Spy) called the character's connection \\"powerful – and very palpable\\". Dainty (Digital Spy) noted that viewers were \\"simply heartbroken\\" about Jac giving up custody of Emma. She also opined that the character's mental health story was \\"sad\\", \\"devastating\\" and \\"heart-wrenching\\". Her colleague, Mustafa, observed that viewers were \\"devastated\\" by Jac's breakdown and praised Marcel's \\"superb performance during the emotional scenes\\". She later noted how viewers \\"struggled with Jac's devastating breakdown\\" and praised Marcel's \\"stellar performance during the tense scenes\\". Haasler (Metro) praised Marcel's \\"heartbreaking\\" acting and dubbed Jac's breakdown \\"a highly dramatic ending to what was a really gripping and, at times, difficult episode to watch.\\" She added, \\"These scenes were deeply upsetting, with Rosie Marcel tapping into such a well of despair that it all felt very real.\\" Writing about Jac's mental health story, Wilson (What's on TV) said, \\"Jac Naylor is often the one person at Holby City hospital who always seems in control. But she's been displaying some rather unusual behaviour of late and doing things that are totally out of character for the Jac Naylor we all know and love...\\" Jac's mental health story sparked a big response from viewers, who contacted Marcel to persuade her not to leave the drama. The actress was surprised by the response, commenting, \\"I knew that Jac was popular, but I didn't really realise just how much until I hinted this might be the end.\\" She later stated that fans were \\"genuinely quite heartbroken\\" for the character because they have watched \\"a character that they love so much turn into something she's not\\". Marcel's co-stars praised her performances and acting techniques as Jac in interviews with Haasler for the book Holby City: Behind the Screen. David Ajao (Damon Ford) called Marcel a \\"professional\\" and said how her work as Jac had inspired him. Eleanor Fanyinka (Morven Digby) said that Marcel's \\"stillness and her power is phenomenal\\".

It was opened on 25 February 1854 and closed in 1951, thirteen years before the rest of the Nunthorpe–Guisborough branch. It served the village of Pinchinthorpe in North Yorkshire, England, a few miles west of Guisborough railway station. History The original Pinchinthorpe railway station, used between 1854 and 1877 Two station buildings were constructed on either side of the bridge that still carries the Guisborough–Great Ayton road over the former railway line. The first station, on the east side of the bridge, was built in 1854 by the M&GR; it has been since converted into cottages. After the North Eastern Railway (NER) purchased the M&GR; in 1863–65, it substantially increased the amount of traffic on the line and doubled the track to Guisborough. To accommodate the increased traffic, the present bridge was constructed in 1876 to replace an earlier level crossing. The NER also built a new and much larger station in 1877 on the west side of the new bridge. Designed by William Peachey, the company's resident architect, the station consisted of a stationmaster's house, porter's lodge, ticket office, toilets, and two waiting rooms. It had two side platforms, replacing the single platform of the original station. Although built inexpensively and without much refinement, it was an improvement on the NER directors' original vision of leaving the stationmaster to continue living in the old station as an economy measure. A similar design to Pinchinthorpe station was used by Peachey at Evenwood railway station in County Durham, which also survives (albeit likewise long closed). 1902 map of the route of the Middlesbrough and Guisborough Railway, showing Pinchinthorpe Station Passenger services on what was originally primarily a mineral railway serving the local mines were initially minimal, consisting of only one train between Guisborough and Middlesbrough a day, but by the 1930s up to eleven trains ran daily. In 1920, the station was renamed from Pinchingthorpe, by then a deprecated spelling, to Pinchinthorpe. The passenger and goods services were withdrawn on 21 October 1951 and the station was closed. It was subsequently converted and remains in use as private accommodation. The Guisborough line closed in 1964 under the Beeching Axe and the track was pulled up, though the trackbed continued to be owned by British Rail until 1989. In 1984, the then Cleveland County Council obtained a licence from BR to reopen three miles (5 km) of the trackbed as a walkway and bridleway. It purchased the trackbed five years later and resurfaced it, also building a number of ponds and wetlands near the first Pinchinthorpe station. The trackbed continues in use as a public trail and nature reserve. A small café and visitor centre was built in 1986 near the original station on the site of the old coal yard, evidence of which can still be seen in the adjoining car park.

Early life Born in Elk Creek, Nebraska, Way was educated at Black Mountain College in North Carolina in its earliest days, where he gained his lifelong interest in graphic design and typography. His first commercial venture was the establishment in 1938 of Grafix Press in nearby Lake Eden, with fellow Black Mountain College student Emil Willimetz. After leaving the College, he began his working life as a fine-arts printer and publisher. In 1953, he entered partnership with the graphic designer Bertram L. Clarke to form Clarke & Way, consolidating a collaboration which began four years previously with work on the production of the twelve volume catalog of the Frick Collection. Harpsichord maker Way came to harpsichord making relatively late in his life. After having built a harpsichord kit by Wolfgang Zuckermann in the late 1960s, Way wrote the \\"Appendix—By a Harpsichord Kit Builder\\" for Zuckermann's book The Modern Harpsichord, which was published in 1969 by Way's own company October House Inc. When Zuckermann prepared to leave the United States soon afterwards, Way sensed a career change, purchased Zuckermann Harpsichords Inc and moved its premises from New York City to the historic seaside village of Stonington, Connecticut. Beginning his evolution of new harpsichord designs based on more historic principles of construction, Way visited European museums and engaged William Hyman—one of the highly regarded American harpsichord makers in Zuckermann's book—as consultant and teacher. The rapid development of the historic harpsichord in this decade was fuelled by the popularity of the harpsichord kit, produced by several companies including Zuckermann and the Boston-based Hubbard Harpsichords Inc. During the 1970s, Way gradually abandoned the more usual modern materials of plywood, hard steel wire and zither tuning pins. At this time, Stonington was the prototype and custom instrument shop while the Zuckermann kits were mass-produced by a facility in Philadelphia. When William Hyman died unexpectedly in 1976, Way was charged with the posthumous completion of several outstanding orders with the assistance of Hyman's last apprentice John Bennett, who remained in Stonington to preside over a dozen workers as foreman through 1990. Way developed a large network of domestic and international Agents who liaised with musicians and distributed the instruments and kits worldwide. In 1983, Stonington took over full-time production of smaller runs of the Zuckermann kits, while continuing to complete the custom-finished instruments signed D. Jacques Way. In the late 1980s he formalised his cross-Atlantic partnership with French harpsichord maker Marc Ducornet, after which many instruments were signed D. Jacques Way & Marc Ducornet. He died of a heart attack in his workshop on February 4, 1994. Philosophy Way did not try to make exact copies of old instruments but rather learn from historical makers: As a master instrument maker, he was always perfecting his craft and focused on the sound of his instruments: Legacy Harpsichords by David Way remain in regular use in many educational institutions and by orchestras worldwide, and are played by many leading harpsichordists including Trevor Pinnock (who has said of his instrument \\"it is modelled somewhat after Hemsch, but the sound is completely David Way\\"). Harpsichord makers who David Way mentored include Carey Beebe, Marc Ducornet, F. Jacob Kaeser, Kevin Fryer, Edward Kottick, Gerald Self and Kevin Spindler. Several of Way's designs are still produced by Zuckermann Harpsichords International, which continues today under the direction of Richard Auber. Way's legacy is also his encouragement of the thousands of amateur musicians and people from all walks of life who discovered the harpsichord through building their own instrument from a Zuckermann kit.

It was nominated for best story, best screenplay, and best cinematography at the 2005 National Film Festival, and it won the best screenplay award for writer- director Prithvi Rana Magar. It is the most expensive film ever made in the history of Nepalese Cinema with a production cost of about 18 million rupees. It was shot on 35-millimeter film—a rarity for Nepalese movies—by Hong Kong cinematographer Gavin Liew. Because of a long and exhausting legal battle between the investors, the film's release was delayed for three years. By the time it hit theaters, the charm of the highly anticipated movie had vanished. Although people who watched the movie liked and appreciated it, it was not successful at the box office because of poor marketing and excessive use of the English language, which Nepalese audiences are not accustomed to. The movie only made around 30% of its investment. It grossed around 12 lakhs in Nepal and 10 lakhs internationally against its budget of 1 crore 18 lakhs. Cast * Dilip Rayamajhi as Himal * Uttam Pradhanas Suraj * Drishya Mishra as Naina * Jharana Bajracharya as Kiran * Mitthila Sharma * Sunil Thapa * Prithvi Rana Magar * Laxmi Giri * Hritika Gurung Plot Man Bahadur (Prithvi Rana Magar) is an ex-Gurkha soldier living in Hong Kong with his family. He has a son named Himal (Dilip Raimajhi), a nephew Suraj (Uttam Pradhan)—whom he has looked after since childhood—and his wife (Mithila Sharma). Himal and Suraj are of the same age and are close. However, there is a great difference in their personalities. Himal’s thinking is Westernized and has friends of poor character. Himal uses drugs occasionally and is dating a girl named Jenny from the Philippines. He spends most of his time in discos, rather than with his family or at work. On the other hand, Suraj has a good work ethic and, unlike Himal, likes Nepalese music, food., and culture. Man Bahadur and his wife are concerned about Himal’s future: Man Bahadur fears their son has escaped their influence, while his wife has not lost hope yet. She thinks if Himal marries a Nepalese girl, everything will be all right. One day in a disco, Himal gets drunk and, not knowing what he is doing, kisses a girl against her will. A fight breaks out between Himal and the girl’s boyfriend, and Himal is badly beaten up. Man Bahadur's worst fears are becoming real now. However, his wife is still optimistic and insists on finding a Nepalese girl for him. Man Bahadur resists at first, but eventually gives up to his wife's pressure and agrees to write to his childhood friend Bal Bahadur (Sunil Thapa) for his daughter Kiran’s (Jharana Bajracharya) hand in marriage for Himal. Man proposes that Bal send his daughter to Hong Kong as a tourist; during her stay in Hong Kong, if Himal and Kiran like each other, only then will their parents announce the marriage. Bal is delighted, thinking Himal is the perfect groom for his daughter and hoping she can escape hardship in Nepal. After consulting his wife, Bal sends Kiran to Hong Kong, telling her that it is their gift for her college vacation. Kiran arrives in Hong Kong, and meets Himal and Suraj; during her stay with the family she gets to know them and finds herself gradually falling in love with Suraj. Himal, on the other hand, is happy with his girlfriend Jenny, drinking and using drugs. Due to absenteeism at work, he is fired from his job, refuses to get another one, and runs through his savings; this drives Jenny to leave him. Himal incurs a serious head injury in a fight with Jenny's new boyfriend and his friends. While in the hospital after surgery, he realizes the error of his ways and vows to turn over a new leaf. Out of gratitude to Man Bahadur and his family, Kiran visits Himal in the hospital and takes care of him. After spending times with Kiran, Himal finds her attractive and slowly starts liking her, but he doesn't know that she is already in love with Suraj. Man Bahadur and his wife see that Himal and Kiran like each other; thinking Kiran is responsible for Himal's rehabilitation. they announce their engagement at a party, which stuns Suraj and Kiran. Kiran leaves the party; Suraj follows her and, after a long talk, convinces Kiran to marry Himal to keep the family together. What happens next? Better leave it here as what happens next is astonishing.

URL accessed 17-April-2007. =Columbus Arsenal= Ordnance Corps General C.P. Buckingham selected a site nearly two years after the congressional authorization of July 1862. It was a tract of about 70 acres northeast of the city, an oak grove owned by Robert and Jannette Neil of Neil House fame. The need for an army arsenal in Central Ohio was acute soon after war broke out. The state arsenal was jammed with arms and equipment for the states' first regiments, but that building was deemed unsafe and a fire hazard. The army needed a modern arsenal for the receipt and issuance of arms and equipment and the manufacture and storage of ammunition. Captain J. W. Todd, of the U .S. Army Ordnance Corps, was the first commander of the Columbus Arsenal, as the post was first known. High command was nothing more than a field of oak stumps and some temporary shacks on land that Captain Todd also prepared the first arsenal master plan: 1 two-story brick workshop, 180′ X 60′ $27,758 4 storehouses, 200′ x 50′ $98,884 barracks and EM quarters $7,500 1 blacksmith shop $2,000 1 stable and laboratory $5,000 1 office building, brick, one-story $2,400 1 officer's quarters, brick, two-story $11,250 1 guardhouse and brick wall, 10′ high $44,283 Railroad switch $5,000 Landscaping $10,000 Inflation $10,000 Total Budget $224,075 The Todd plan was $10,000 in excess of what Congress was to be asked to appropriate. Captain Todd did not remain at this assignment long enough to see his plan accepted for implementation. He was replaced by the \\"Father\\" of Fort Hayes, Captain T. C. Bradford, on January 16, 1864. Bradford arrived to build the new post from scratch, where he served until 1867, being promoted to Major, then Colonel before 1866. He resumed command again for six months in 1869, then departed for San Antonio. Bradford's first task was to secure the completion of the rail spur and procure carts, horses, tools, hoisting machines and materials with which to build the main building and other buildings. By April 1864, the excavation was dug, the tracks' grading completed, and temporary carpenter's shop built, and two wells dug and equipped with pumps to supply water for the needs of men, animals, and construction. Bradford called his MAGNUS OPUS the \\"Store House\\", the first of many names which would be applied to the post's principal facility. Plans for the building had been drawn in Washington by the Ordnance Corps. Bradford, however, made many on-site changes to the plans as construction proceeded. Building materials in that time were difficult and expensive to obtain. For foundation material, Bradford went to Newark, Ohio, for sandstone, the first cargo brought in on the new rail spur during the summer of 1864. Brick was fired in Columbus by brickmakers who Bradford continually had to watch because of inferior workmanship. Flooring and other timber he obtained from southern Ohio (There are 50,000 board feet of ash flooring in the arsenal which cost $20.00 to $25.00 per thousand feet). Copper and cast iron cornices he had manufactured in Cincinnati. The officers' quarters and magazine were ordered built on June 3, 1864, as designed by master building Joseph O. Sawyer. The foundation for the magazine, with a capacity of 2,500 barrels of powder, was built in September, ready for brickwork, and all lumber for this building was on the grounds. As the main building rose, Bradford devoted much attention to the tower. The original purpose of this dominant feature was to accommodate stone steps to each floor. At Bradford's urging, the plans were altered to incorporate wooden steps and hoisting apparatus, and an elevator to move supplies more easily among the floors. As finally constructed, the tower was a duplicate of the one attached to the Indianapolis arsenal. Long before the main arsenal building was completed in 1865, the post was receiving, storing, and issuing arms and accoutrements in large amounts. On May 6, 1864, 10,000 sets of equipage and five thousand Enfield rifles to arm \\"three-months\\" of enlistees were being issued, and the post had enough arms stored in the temporary warehouse to arm and equip 30,000 men. From its holding that month alone, the Columbus Arsenal shipped to other arsenals two million rounds of elongated ball cartridges, 400 percussion artillery shells, and 600 shells for 3-inch guns. The first building at Fort Hayes was completed in 1864 and is known as Building #62. Arms and equipment of the \\"100-day\\" men being mustered out in Ohio were being received by the arsenal in August 1864, but not until late that year were the commodious facilities of the main building in use. Public attention was focused on the arsenal on May 4, 1865, when, to mark the funeral of President Lincoln, guns were fired on the minute from noon to sunset. Ironically, the first man killed on the post was Nicholas Hartzel, who, on May 16, was blown up while firing a salute. The main business of the arsenal during the last months of the war was the trans-shipment of ammunition (paper and metal cartridges), the receipt and issuance of Springfield rifles, and sets of equipage for 10 regiments to be formed at Camp Chase in Columbus. Civilians, under Colonel Bradford, conducted much of the business of the arsenal until October 25, 1865, when the first permanently assigned detachment of enlisted men were stationed here. Twenty-five men were authorized to be enlisted locally and were ordered to be one sergeant, four corporals, five privates first class, and twelve privates second class. These new recruits of the regular army were quickly trained by Bradford to receive the large amount of arms and equipment being turned in by Ohio regiments rapidly being deactivated. Civilian employees were retained to repair, in the main building, the Springfield and Enfield rifle muskets turned in by either cannibalizing or by adding new parts shipped in from the Springfield Armory. The rule was, if a piece could be made serviceable for fifty cents or less, to do so; if not, utilize only the unworn parts. On November 10, 1865, with the magazine at the post filled to capacity, the main building's basement was authorized for storage of ammunition, and the first live rounds were placed in the building. Four million cartridges were placed in the basement that winter, and 10,000 new Spencer carbines were stored in upper floors. So crowded was the building late in November that the first public auction of military stores was authorized and held. By early 1866, artillery was stored in large numbers of pieces, transferred from the Newport, Kentucky arsenal under Colonel Bradford's personal supervision. The appearance of the Civil War era Columbus arsenal was ragged and cluttered until Spring of 1866, when the first shade and ornamental trees and shrubs were planted at a cost of $150. With the coming of peace, the post came to assume a more ordered, regulated posture. The War Department transferred the Columbus arsenal on September 24, 1875 to the general Recruiting Service for depot purposes, where it came to be known as Columbus Barracks. At that time, the value of site and building was reckoned at nearly $500,000. =Columbus Barracks and Fort Hayes= In 1875, the War Department repurposed the facility for use as a recruiting intake and training facility. It became known as the Columbus Barracks and later the Columbus Arsenal. In 1922, the property was renamed Fort Hayes, in honor of Rutherford B. Hayes. Between 1875 and 1890, Columbus Barracks was used to instruct recruits, specifically music boys, select recruits, disposable recruits, unexamined recruits, and colored recruits. Four companies of cadre were organized in February 1881. Recruits were given specialized instruction of from one to four months' duration. In 1894, the command general of the Department of the East took charge of Columbus. Barracks and garrisoned it with the 17th Infantry Regiment. The post remained as a recruiting rendezvous manned by two skeleton companies for the next two years when it entered, during the Spanish–American War, a period of building and enlarged occupancy for recruitment and training. The arsenal building, now called the Main Building, was altered inside to accommodate 500 recruits. New barracks, officers' houses, and a host of other buildings were erected (among them the reception center, mess building, drill hall, new guardhouse and bandstand). A post newspaper, The Army Herald, was started in 1895 and continued until 1896. A file is in the library of the Ohio Historical Society. In 1900, the post was enlarged by nearly 8 acres, and five years later became officially the Columbus Recruiting Depot of two infantry companies and six recruiting companies. A band was assigned the post in 1906 when concerns became a regular public attraction. Electricity came to the depot in 1908, and with it a new building program of a hospital, PX, a gym, new officers' quarters, noncommissioned officers' quarters, a bakery, a laundry, a warehouse and several barracks. The razing, in 1910, of the old headquarters building uncovered the site of one of Colonel Bradford's original wells. With the advent of World War I and the signing by President Wilson on May 18, 1917, of the Selective Military Conscription Act, old Columbus barracks became a beehive of activity. Barns and stables became garages and repair shops as the Army increased numbers of Regular Army recruits who passed through the post beginning in 1917. After the war, in 1922, the post became headquarters of the Fifth Corps comprising the areas of Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana and Kentucky. Major General George A. Reed was the commander when, in June, the corps came to Columbus. In 1922, the name of the post was changed to Fort Hayes in honor of Rutherford B. Hayes, an Ohio Governor and later President of the United States. In 1933, the present parade grounds were constructed and the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed seven new frame buildings During the early years of World War II, Fort Hayes continued as it had in the past as a reception center when it had stationed on its grounds 2,000 officers and men. But on March 1, 1944, this function was discontinued. The Ohio National Guard was granted use of the post on December 17, 1946. Used by both the Army Reserve and the Guard of Engineers, it continued in use by the State and Federal governments for both military and civilian functions. =Fort Hayes Metropolitan Education Center= Fort Hayes Metropolitan Education Center (FHMEC), an urban public high school, located at the edge of downtown Columbus, has as its mission \\" …to create expectations of excellence within students through challenging and collaborative learning, blending the arts, academics and career programs.\\" The Fort Hayes Career Center was established in 1976 on the site of a part of the military base. Fort Hayes was used as a training and induction center during the Civil War through the Vietnam War, the Federal Government abandoned the fifty acres on which the Fort Hayes Career Center (now the Fort Hayes Metropolitan Education Center) is located. Through the leadership of Jack Gibbs and the efforts of two local congressmen, the Columbus Public Schools was able to purchase these fifty acres for one dollar ($1.00). The career center was composed of four buildings–the Business Building, the Health Building, the Visual Arts Center (Shot Tower—though shot was never made here), and the Battelle Math/Science Building. In the fall of 1988, the Fort Hayes campus became the site for three unique educational programs: a career center program, The Battelle Youth Science Program, and an arts and academic high school. The Fort Hayes Career Center component offers vocational courses in health/medical services, data processing, commercial art and photography, and the fine and performing arts. The Battelle Youth Science Program provided advanced laboratory and academic courses in math and science. The Fort Hayes Arts and Academic High School, the newest component, focuses on excellence in performance–performance in a rigorous college preparatory program and a rich immersion in the art areas of music, dance, theater, and visual arts. During the 1988–89 school year, the Fort Hayes Arts and Academic High School was created, joining Columbus Public Schools' excellently rated arts, business, childcare, and health vocational programs. Ninth and tenth graders (about 223 of them) arrived to begin the work of starting a new high school, along with 23 new staff members. An additional grade level was added each year, and the first senior class graduated in June 1991. Twice in the past ten years, the school has been recognized by Redbook magazine as an outstanding school in the country, and in the Spring of 1995, by Ohio's Best Schools as an exemplary \\"Break the Mold School.\\" In 1997, the school was recognized by Business Week magazine as one of ten schools in the nation for Instructional Innovation with an Arts-Driven Curriculum. The International Network for Performing and Visual Arts Schools selected Fort Hayes as the Outstanding School for the 1997–98 school year. FHMEC reflects the cultural, economic, religious and ethnic diversity of the urban community it serves: 51 percent African-American; 47 percent Caucasian; nearly 4 percent Asian- American; and less than 1 percent Hispanic students. Sixty-three percent of the students are female. Students bring a variety of religious beliefs: Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, and Taoist. Approximately 30 percent of the students reside in low-income households. With some exceptions, the remaining 70 percent reside in middle-income households. Over 1100 students, 80-plus faculty, and five administrators are located on the total campus in the course of a school day. http://fthayes.org/wpfh/aboutus/history- of-fort-hayes/ See also * Fort Hayes Metropolitan Education Center References External links * Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Franklin County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Columbus, Ohio Hayes, Fort Hayes Category:1863 establishments in Ohio Category:American Civil War on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Historic districts in Franklin County, Ohio ","title":"Fort Hayes"},{"id":"10736052","text":"Oncolites from the upper Burgsvik beds (Silurian), with shell fragments as nuclei.

Oncolites are sedimentary structures composed of oncoids, which are layered structures formed by cyanobacterial growth. Oncolites are very similar to stromatolites, but, instead of forming columns, they form approximately spherical structures. The oncoids often form around a central nucleus, such as a shell fragment, and a calcium carbonate structure is deposited by encrusting microbes. Oncolites are indicators of warm waters in the photic zone, but are also known in contemporary freshwater environments.Riding, Robert. 1991. Calcareous Algae and Stromatolites, pp. 32.

The appearance of recent/subrecent freshwater oncoids has been documented in two rivers in Bavaria: the Alz, whose source is the Chiemsee, and the Moosach, near Freising. Oncolites may have either a porostromate or spongiostromate texture. Most oncolites are spongiostromate, having no recognisable cellular texture or microstructure. Porostromate oncolites are mostly unknown during the Precambrian; since the Eocene they have mostly been confined to freshwater environments.

Cafferata was born in Buenos Aires, the son of an immigrant businessman from Genoa, Italy, who had settled in Rosario (southern Santa Fe). He studied law at the Jesuit's College of the Immaculate Conception in the city of Santa Fe. He then moved to Córdoba and became Doctor in Jurisprudence at the University of San Carlos (later National University of Córdoba). At this time he was also a member of the provincial Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of the legislature) and of the Municipal Council of Córdoba.Guía de calles de Rosario. He returned to Rosario after his graduation in 1881 to become the Political Chief of the city (at the time the local municipal authorities were appointed by the provincial government, not elected by the citizens). Cafferata was Minister of Government to governors Manuel María Zavalla, José Gálvez and his own successor Luciano Leiva. After Gálvez's rule he was elected to replace him. He was the governor of Santa Fe from 7 April 1890 until his resignation in August 1893. During Cafferata's term, 17 colonies were founded in the province and many elementary schools were opened. He also saw the opening of the Salesian College of Arts and Crafts, now San José College, in Rosario, and the official inauguration of the Provincial University of Santa Fe, projected during his predecessor's rule. Facing a difficult economic situation, his government issued bonds without authorization of the Legislature to pay public employees' salaries. A few days after the beginning of the uprising known as the Revolution of 1893, which questioned the legitimacy of the elections that had taken him to power, Cafferata resigned and moved with his family to Buenos Aires. The revolution, led by the newly formed Radical Civic Union against the rule of the National Autonomist Party, brought the Radical governor Mariano Candioti to power, though only for less than two months, until the defeat of the Radicals, first on the national level, and then in Santa Fe. Cafferata died in Córdoba, in 1920, of tuberculosis. His remains were brought to Rosario and buried in the Saviour's Cemetery.

Rhenish Cathedrals The three Romanesque cathedrals of Mainz, Worms and Speyer in the northwestern Upper Rhine area are called Rhenish Imperial Cathedrals. The construction of Mainz Cathedral was begun about 975 under Archbishop Willigis, then regent of the Holy Roman Empire for minor King Otto III. His seat was already meant as a kind of \\"state church\\", it was the first building of this size north of the Alps. The cathedral was completed in 1009, burnt down at the dedication, and was immediately rebuilt. Willigis may have planned to replace Aachen Cathedral as coronation church of the King of the Romans; indeed Otto's III successors Henry II (in 1002) and Conrad II (in 1024) were crowned in Mainz, but both presumably in the preceding building, since the present cathedral was not consecrated until in 1038. King Henry IV also contributed to the building after another blaze in 1081. Mainz Cathedral was the coronation site for Philip of Swabia, for Frederick II, and anti-king Henry Raspe. Speyer Cathedral is the world's largest preserved Romanesque church (after the demolition of Cluny Abbey) and today a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was built starting about 1025 by King Conrad II as a family vault for the ruling Salian dynasty. His successor Henry III donated the Speyer Gospels in 1046; the building was completed in 1061 under the rule of King Henry IV. During the Investiture Controversy with Pope Gregory VIII, he had the church again extended from 1081, in order to stress his Imperial authority. His mortal remains were transferred to the cathedral by his son Henry V in 1111. Worms Cathedral, a highrising building, was built from about 1130 to 1181. It houses the tombs of Emperor Conrad's II family and also got its status because of its size and glory. The church was the site of the nomination of Pope Leo IX in 1048 and of the conclusion of the 1122 Concordat of Worms ending the Investiture Controversy. In 1235 the marriage of Emperor Frederick II with Isabella of England took place here. image:Mainzer Dom vom Kreuzgang.jpgMainz Cathedral image:Worms Dom Ostfassade Vierung2005-05-27a.jpgWorms Cathedral image:Speyer Dom BW 11.JPGSpeyer Cathedral Carolingian foundations Aachen Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1978, today is the seat of the Bishops of Aachen and the city's landmark. Its central octagon was erected from the late 8th century onwards as the chapel of the Palace of Aachen, a residence of Emperor Charlemagne. The building, a masterpiece of the Carolingian Renaissance, has been expanded several times over the centuries; from 936 it served as the coronation church of the Kings of the Romans after their election at Frankfurt. Nevertheless, the former Palatine Chapel did not attain the rank of a cathedral until 1802, permanently in 1930. Frankfurt Cathedral (St Bartholomew Church) is also described as an Imperial cathedral, though it never had been a bishop's seat. The present Gothic building replaced a Carolingian palatine chapel, erected at the Frankfurt royal palace (Königpfalz). It was rebuilt as a basilica and collegiate church consecrated by Archbishop Rabanus Maurus in 852. Frankfurt first became the site of the election of the German monarch with the accession of Frederick Barbarossa in 1152, definitely fixed in the Golden Bull of 1356. From 1562 until 1792, Frankfurt was also the site of the Imperial coronation ceremony led by the Archbishop of Mainz. image:Aachen Germany Imperial-Cathedral-01.jpgAachen Cathedral image:Mk Frankfurt Dom Saalhof.jpgFrankfurt Cathedral Other Bamberg Cathedral with its four towers also has the same status. Built from 1004 onwards for the newly established Bishopric of Bamberg at the behest of the last Ottonian King Henry II and his wife Cunigunde of Luxembourg, the church is the site where the only canonized imperial couple has their grave. In 1046 Bishop Suidger of Bamberg was elected Pope Clement II; his grave at the cathedral is the only tomb of a Pope north of the Alps. The Romanesque building, also known for the Bamberg Horseman, is part of the historic Town of Bamberg and today also listed as a World Heritage Site. Less well known is that the imperial burial church in the small town of Königslutter, a basilica built from 1135 as a Benedictine abbey church and family vault of the Supplinburger dynasty in the Saxon lands of Emperor Lothair II. The church was completed about 1170, more than 30 years after Lothair's death, by the Welf duke Henry the Lion at the time when the Imperial rule had already passed to the Swabian house of Hohenstaufen. Magdeburg Cathedral, see of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg founded by Emperor Otto the Great in 968, as well as Palermo Cathedral (Maria Santissima Assunta) with the sarcophagi of the Hohenstaufen emperors Henry VI and Frederick II are sometimes also called Imperial cathedrals. image:Bamberger Dom BW 6.JPGBamberg Cathedral image:Kaiserdom Königslutter 2.jpgKönigslutter Cathedral image:Magdeburger Dom Seitenansicht.jpgMagdeburg Cathedral image:Palermo BW 2012-10-09 12-04-52.jpgPalermo Cathedral References Category:Landmarks in Germany Cath Category:Romanesque architecture in Germany Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Germany ","title":"Imperial Cathedrals"},{"id":"10736309","text":"Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital (CRMH) is a private teaching hospital in Roanoke, Virginia, USA.

Originally starting as a combination of new wave, punk rock and post-punk, the band later slowly changed their style, becoming a mainstream rock act. They were one of the most notable acts of the former Yugoslav rock scene.  History  = New wave years (1980–1983) = The melodic hard rock band Hipnotisano Pile (Hypnotized Chicken), formed in 1979, which got the name by the line from the Iggy Pop song \\"Lust For Life\\", consisted of Srđan Gojković \\"Gile\\" (drums), Ljubomir Jovanović \\"Jovec\\" (guitar), Bojan Banović (vocals), Vladan Stepanović (guitar), \\"Džo\\" Otašević (keyboards). The band performed their own material, mainly written by Banović, on Guitar festivals in Belgrade. In mid-January 1980, at the Mornar bistro, after a Leb i Sol concert held at the Belgrade Dom Sindikata, Hipnotisano Pile members, drummer Gojković and guitarist Jovanović, were sitting with organ player Ljubomir Đukić \\"Ljuba\\", and planning to form an ad hoc punk rock group, in which Gojković was to play guitar and sing lead vocals, and Jovanović to switch to playing drums. The band was to play as an opening act for Hipnotisano Pile. The idea for the band name came from Gojković, and, while they were waiting for the waiter, Đukić wrote the lyrics for the song \\"Konobar\\" (\\"The Waiter\\"). Soon after, Gojković wrote a few more songs, \\"Krokodili dolaze\\" (\\"Crocodiles Are Coming\\"), \\"Zlatni papagaj\\" (\\"Golden Parrotbill\\"), and \\"Vi\\" (\\"You\\"). The band was officially formed on 13 January 1980 and was completed with guitarist Goran Sinadinović and bassist Marina Vulić. The band members then went to Momčilo Rajin and Nebojša Pajkić, both of them in charge of the SKC program, asking for the rehearsal room and booking their first live appearance. In June 1980, the band played as an opening act for Hipnotisano Pile in front of the crowd of about 300 people. Dissatisfied with the Hipnotisano Pile performance, more than half of the audience left the hall. After the performance, Hipnotisano Pile disbanded. Sinadinović also left Električni Orgazam, and with Bojan Banović formed the band Petar i Zli Vuci. Jovanović returned to playing guitar, and the drummer became former Butik drummer Goran Čavajda \\"Čavke\\", whom Gojković asked on several occasions to join the band. The lineup had their first live appearance at a local party, and, soon after, at the Palilula Culture Olympics, where they stopped the performance due to the unsatisfactory amplification. In autumn the same year, the band performed at the Festival Omladina, which was arranged by Riblja Čorba leader Bora Đorđević. Before the performance, the band was warned not to move too much on the stage which had several levels and was unstable. The reaction of the band was quite the opposite, breaking microphones, cymbals, and kitschy stage decorations, eventually getting disqualified. The festival was the place where new wave bands from Belgrade and Zagreb had met for the first time, and the Zagreb band Film won the festival. The following year, the band had their first recordings, the songs \\"Krokodili dolaze\\", \\"Zlatni papagaj\\" and \\"Vi\\", released by Jugoton on the Paket aranžman (Package deal), three way split album, with the recordings of Idoli and Šarlo Akrobata. The compilation was to feature two more bands, Tunel, and the embryonic Bajaga i Instruktori called Fleke, but were eventually turned down. The success of Paket aranžman provided the band an opportunity to record and release their debut album under the same label. The band was previously turned down by RTV Ljubljana, stating that the album lacked originality, and PGP-RTB, which had problems with the song lyrics for \\"Krokodili dolaze\\" and \\"Nebo\\" (\\"The Sky\\"). Električni orgazam, produced by Ivan Stančić \\"Piko\\", featured the band's authentic sound, found in the songs \\"Nebo\\", \\"Konobar\\", \\"I've Got a Feeling\\", both released on the band first single, and new versions of \\"Krokodili dolaze\\" and \\"Vi\\". The album did not feature the band drummer Čavajda, who was at the time serving the Yugoslav People's Army, being temporarily replaced by Grupa I member Branko Kuštrin \\"Mango\\". The album, for which the album cover and design was done by Gojković, had positive reactions by both the audience and the critics, including a review of the album by the NME journalist Kris Bohn, who stated that the band was one of the most exciting non-British acts. Since Gojković was spending time in London, he provided the New Musical Express with a few copies of the album, resulting the band signing with Rough Trade Records for distributing the copies of the album to England. After the album release, in autumn 1981, Marina Vulić left the band, being replaced by Jovan Jovanović \\"Grof\\", and Čavajda returned to the group. In the meantime, the band met a student from Poland, Grzegorz Brzozowicz, who had contacts with the people from the Warsaw club Rivijera Remont, gathering the fans of new wave and punk rock. Bzozovič arranged the three bands from Paket aranžman to perform in Poland, and after Šarlo Akrobata, in November, the band went on a tour of Poland, playing six dates, four Warsaw, one at Kraków, and one at Kalisz. The performance of 8 November, at Rivijera Remont, was recorded on a simple tape recorder, later released on the six-song Warszawa '81 EP, limited to 2000 copies, being the first official bootleg in former Yugoslavia. The rough recordings were post- produced by Slobodan Konjović, presenting a valid document of the band sound, as well as the audience reaction, not accustomed to visiting punk rock concerts. During the performance of the song \\"Konobar\\", there was a half- minute sound equipment failure, during which a member of the audience dropped tear gas. The disturbance was documented on the record, which featured two new songs, \\"Leptir\\" (\\"The Butterfly\\") and \\"Razgovori\\" (\\"Conversations\\"). The album Lišće prekriva Lisabon (Leaves Fall Over Lisbon) was recorded at the Ljubljana Tivoli Studio, produced by the band themselves with the help of Toni Jurij. The album, which got the name by the title of the Serbian translation of the Barbara Cartland novel Lovers in Lisbon, featured seventeen songs, presenting a new aspect of the band's work, gradually influenced by psychedelic rock, with all the tracks having one-word song titles. Gojković later stated that the during the writing process the band was experimenting with LSD, which influenced the outbreak of the album. The songs \\"Afrika\\" (\\"Africa\\") and \\"Alabama\\", a cover version of The Doors interpretation of the Bertolt Brecht poem, featured Gojković and Đukić sharing vocals duties. The song \\"Dokolica\\" (\\"Idleness\\"), also released on single with the dub version of the song on B-side, featured the lyrics Gojković found in a sociology book, and the songs \\"Leptir\\", \\"Odelo\\" (\\"Suit\\") and \\"Podstanar\\" (\\"Sub-tenant\\"), deal with the problems of urban alienation. The album featured guest appearance by the trumpet player Petar Ugrin on the songs \\"Alabama\\" and \\"Leptir\\". In autumn 1983, Gojković and Ivan Stančić \\"Piko\\", influenced by the New York City underground scene, formed the band Hijene (Hyenas), and recorded the album WooDoo za početnike (Voodoo For Beginners). However, dissatisfied with the record label treatment, the album was never released, but it did inspire the recording of the band fifth album Distorzija (Distortion). The next discography release was the unexpected cover album Les Chansones Populaires (French for Popular songs), produced by Gojković, Đukić, Toni Jurij and Piko Stančić, who also played drums due to Čavajda being in prison, featuring eight cover versions, including the David Bowie \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\", T.Rex \\"Metal Guru\\", The Doors \\"When the Music's Over\\", and Little Eva \\"Locomotion\\", the latter also released on single. The tour following the album release featured Mango Kuštrin on drums. = Personnel crisis, mainstream success, disbandment (1984–1989) = In 1984, when they were about to enter the studio in order to record the fourth studio album, the band lineup changed, as the drummer Čavajda returned to the band and guitarist Jovanović left the band. With guest appearances by Ivan Pajević (guitar), Piko Stančić (drums), Goran Pojatić (piano), Kire Mitrev (trombone), Ivan Švager (saxophone), and Goce Dimitrovski (trumpet), the band recorded the album Kako bubanj kaže (As The Drum Decides), musically influenced by the early 1970s work of the Rolling Stones, also suggested by the album artwork. Like on all of the previous releases, vocal duties were shared between Gojković and Đukić. The track \\"Fras u šupi\\" (\\"Seizure In The Shed\\"), which appeared on the album, was a part of the trilogy, beside the story collection, written by David Albahari, and the poem of the same name, written by Miloš Komadina in his poetry book Etika trave (Grass Ethics). The song music and lyrics were written by Gojković, except for \\"Pričam o tebi\\" (\\"I Am Talking About You\\"), for which the music was written by Čavajda. The album did not repeat the success of the previous releases, leading Đukić to leaving the band and moving to New York. The band, being in the personnel crisis, firstly featured Ivan Pajević on guitar, then former Siluete member Nikola Čuturilo, until the full-time member became Branislav Petrović \\"Banana\\", a former Bezobrazno Zeleno and Pasta ZZ member. In 1986, when the band was about to record the album Distorzija, bassist Jovanović left the band and stopped his musical career. His replacement was the former Katarina II and Du-Du-A member Zoran Radomirović \\"Švaba\\". The comeback album, Distorzija, with simple rock songs, featured the hit songs \\"Debela devojka\\" (\\"Fat Girl\\"), \\"Ja sam težak kao konj\\" (\\"I Am Heavy As A Horse\\"), \\"Ne postojim\\" (\\"I Do Not Exist\\"), \\"Vudu bluz\\" (\\"Voodoo Blues\\"), \\"Kapetan Esid\\" (\\"Captain Acid\\"), \\"Ša la la\\" (\\"Sha La La\\"), and \\"Lui Lui\\" (\\"Louie Louie\\"), a cover of Richard Berry song. The album was produced by Gojković and Stančić, and the cover for the album was done by the painter Radovan Hiršl. The next release was the live album Braćo i sestre (Brothers And Sisters), recorded on October 1986 at the Zagreb club Kulušić. The album, featuring the guest introduction by Dražen Vrdoljak and guest vocals by Ljubomir Đukić on the song \\"Locomotion\\", included the new track \\"Bejbe, ti nisi tu\\" (\\"Baby, You Are Not Here\\"), a cover version of the Rolling Stones song \\"Out of Time\\". Two years later, in 1988, the band, with the same musical style, released the album Letim, sanjam, dišem (Flying, Dreaming, Breathing), and the songs \\"Igra rock 'n' roll cela Jugoslavija\\" (\\"The Whole Yugoslavia Is Dancing To Rock And Roll\\"), \\"Ti\\" (\\"You\\"), \\"Poljubi me i priznaj mi\\" (\\"Kiss Me And Confess\\"), and \\"Sve ste vi naš devojke\\" (\\"All of You Are Our Girlfriends\\") became immediate hits. The album was produced by Gojković, Stančić and Theodore Yanni, and featured guest appearance by Partibrejkers guitarist Nebojša Antonijević \\"Anton\\" and Bajaga i Instruktori keyboard player Saša Lokner. On Summer of the same year, the band promoted the album with a concert at Tašmajdan Stadium. During the same year, they released the greatest hits compilation album Najbolje pesme 1980-1988 (The Best Songs 1980–1988), and disbanded. Radomirović and Petrović joined the band Trans. Gojković pursued a solo career, releasing his first solo album Evo sada vidiš da može (Now You See It Is Possible), released in 1989, and worked on the Kako je propao rokenrol (The Fall of Rock 'N' Roll) and Crni bombarder (Black Bomber) movie soundtracks. With Vlada Divljan, he released two music albums for children Rokenrol za decu (Rock 'N' Roll For Children), and Rokenrol bukvar (Rock 'N' Roll Alphabet), and the two, with Stančić and Radomirović, released the album Lutka koja kaže ne (A Doll That Says No). Čavajda went to Australia in 1988, and returned in 1991, joining Gojković and Radomirović on the Lutka koja kaže ne tour. = Reformation, Čavajda's departure (1991–1994) = Srđan Gojković \\"Gile\\" (center) and Goran Čavajda \\"Čavke\\" (far left) performing with Rimtutituki in 1992 The reformed Električni Orgazam released the compilation album Seks, droga, nasilje i strah / Balkan Horror Rock (Sex, Drugs, Violence and Fear / Blakan Horror Rock), featuring new studio material on the A-side, including \\"Mala lopta metalna\\" (\\"Little Metal Ball\\") composed by Čavajda and Gojković, and live recordings, made at the Novi Sad concert performance. The followup, the live album Balkan Horror Rock II, released on compact cassette only, featured the rest of Novi Sad concert recordings and \\"Svečane bele košulje\\" (\\"Ceremony White Shirts\\") and \\"Mjau, mjau\\" (\\"Meow, Meow\\"), made at the B92 birthday concert. The album covers for both releases were designed by Linda Čavajda, Čavajda's wife. In 1992, Čavajda, Gojković and Radomirović, with Ljubomir Jovanović, Ekatarina Velika frontman Milan Mladenović, and Partibrejkers members Zoran Kostić \\"Cane\\" and Nebojša Antonijević \\"Anton\\" formed the anti-war group Rimtutituki, recording the single \\"Slušaj 'vamo\\" (\\"Listen Up\\"), released by Radio B92. The following year, in September, the band, with Ekatarina Velika, Partibrejkers, and the Zagreb band Vještice, performed in Prague and Berlin on the concerts entitled Ko to tamo pjeva (Who's That Singing Over There). Električni Orgazam was also one of the first Serbian bands to perform in Ljubljana, with the band Majke from Vinkovci, also playing in Maribor, Koper and Hum. At the time, the band often performed in the Republic of Macedonia. The double album Zašto da ne! (Why Not!), featuring a stylistic combination of Lišće prekriva Lisabon and Distorzija combined with the 1990s musical trends, was recorded with guitarist Dejan Radisavljević \\"Role\\", a former Revolveri member, keyboard player Zoran Zagorčić, a former Du-Du-A member, and Srđan Todorović as the second drummer. As guests on the album appeared Zoran Kostić \\"Cane\\" (vocals), politician Nenad Čanak (flute), Nenad Racković (backing vocals), and Neša Petrović (saxophone). The acoustically oriented song sections for the album were composed by Petrović, who co-written the song \\"Dajem ljubav\\" (\\"I Give Love\\") with Zagorčić. By Gojković's idea, the album cover was designed by Džukele guitarist Leonid Pilipović, expanding it with a short comic-book. After the album release, Čavajda left the band, completely devoting himself to the band Babe, formed in 1992, and was replaced by the former Pasta ZZ and Partibrejkers member Vlada Funtek. = Lineup changes, comeback releases (1995–2003) = In early 1995, the band celebrated their fifteenth anniversary at the Belgrade club Prostor, and, in July, performed at the London club The Bottom Line. The recordings from the performance were used by Marina Vulić, who lived in London since 1985, working as video producer, for the release of a promotional video. On 17 April 1996 the band performed an unplugged concert at the Novi Sad Studio M, featuring the band introduction by Zdenko Kolar, and guest appearances by Margita Stefanović (piano, Farfisa organ), Boris Bunjac (percussion), and Deže Molnar (saxophone). The album, recorded with the new drummer Miloš Velimir \\"Buca\\", featured a cover version of the Korni Grupa song \\"Magična ruka\\" (\\"Magic Hand\\"). Beside working with Električni Orgazam, Gojković played in the Vlada Divljan Old Stars Band, producing their live album Odbrana i zaštita (Defence And Protection), and performed on their studio album Sve laži sveta (All The Lies of the World), released by Automatik Records in 2000. Founding the Yellow Dog records, Gojković re-released most of the Električni Orgazam releases on compact disc, featuring bonus material. The debut album featured the three songs from Paket aranžman, Lišće prekriva Lisabon featured the \\"Dokolica\\" dub version, Kako bubanj kaže featured \\"Tetovirane devojke\\" (\\"Tattooed Girls\\"), the title track single B-side, and the previously unreleased \\"Slatka mala devojčica\\" (\\"Sweet Little Girl\\"), Seks, droga, nasilje i strah / Balkan Horror Rock and Balkan Horror Rock II were released as a single CD, featuring the bonus track \\"Hodam sad kao zombi\\", a cover of the Roky Erickson \\"I Walked with a Zombie\\" with Gojković on lead vocals, and the live EP Warszava '81 was expanded with ten live recordings from the Polish tour. On 10 July 1998 the band, in the lineup Gojković, Petrović, bassist Zdenko Kolar, and drummer Ivan Ranković \\"Raka\\", a former Tvrdo Srce i Velike Uši and Ekatarina Velika member, guest starred the concert featuring bands from former Yugoslav republics. The following year, the band recorded the comeback CD A um bum (A 'oom Boom), featuring guest appearances by numerous rock veterans, Kornelije Kovač, Branko Marušić \\"Čutura\\", Bata Kostić, and the younger musicians, keyboard player Slobodan Misailović and drummers Ivan Ranković and Srđan Todorović. The cataclysmic drawings on the album cover were done by Gojković, and the album featured the Dylanesque acoustic rock sound. Lead vocals for the tracks \\"Gde da nađem takvu devojku\\" (\\"Where Would I Find Such A Girl\\"), and \\"Ja nisam znao neke stvari\\" (\\"I Did Not Know Some Things\\") were done by Petrović. In May 2000, the band performed at the Zagreb club Tvornica, and the KSET performance was canceled due to the arrest of Gojković by the police which found 0,22 grams of heroin in his possession. The media gave much attention to the affair, and Gojković was released after a night in prison, where the police officers asked for autographs and taking pictures with him, with a fee of 250 Deutsche Marks. The compilation album Najbolje pesme vol. 2 1992-1999 (The Best Songs Volume 2 1992–1999), featuring the selection of the tracks recorded in the 1990s. The following album, Harmonajzer, produced by Dušan Kojić \\"Koja\\", Gojković and Petrović, featured the new drummer Blagoje Nedeljković \\"Pače\\", and guest appearances by Vlada Divljan (wah guitar), Zoran Erkan \\"Zerkman\\" (trumpet), Nemanja Kojić \\"Kojot\\" (trombome), Dušan Petrović (saxophone), Zdenko Kolar and Boris Bunjac (backing vocals). Ljuba Đukić did the lead vocals for the track \\"Zato stojim sam\\" (\\"That Is Why I Stand Alone\\"), and Petrović sang lead vocals for \\"Promene\\" (\\"Changes\\") and \\"Tome neće doći kraj\\" (\\"It Would Not End\\"). Radomirović and Kojić co-wrote two instrumental tracks, \\"Đankarlo Gingva ponovo jaše\\" (\\"Giancarlo Gingva Rides Again\\") and \\"PECTOPAH 3 OPA\\" (false friend pun for \\"RESTAURANT DAWN\\"). = Reunion with Đukić (2004–present) = In September 2004, Ljuba Đukić officially returned to the group, and, in 2006, the band released the compilation album Breskve u teškom sirupu vol. 1 (Peaches in Heavy Syrup Volume 1), using the unused album title of the album Lišće prekriva Lisabon, featuring the rehearsal recordings made at the Belgrade SKC and the performance at Tašmajdan Stadium, both recorded in 1980. The band then went on a nine-dates mini tour, performing the songs from the new wave period in a modern and rearranged manner, including the last concert at the Belgrade Dom Omladine, featuring guest appearance by the founding band member Ljubomir Jovanović \\"Jovec\\". The whole concert was recorded and the recordings were released on the live album ElOrgNewWave, by Mascom in 2007. During the same year, on 14 July, the band performed as an opening act for the Rolling Stones, on their concert in Belgrade's Ušće park. In September the same year, the band went on their first United States tour. On 28 September 2008, the band performed at the 30th anniversary of new wave music in Yugoslavia at the concert held in the Zagreb Tvornica kulture, along with the most notable participants of the Yugoslav new wave, including Darko Rundek of Haustor, Pero Lovšin of Pankrti, Jasenko Houra and Davorin Bogović of Prljavo Kazalište and Vlada Divljan of Idoli. The songs \\"Konobar\\", \\"Krokodili dolaze\\", \\"Leptir\\", \\"Nebo\\", and \\"Zlatni papagaj\\" performed at the concert were released on the live album Sedmorica veličanstvenih – 30 godina kasnije (The Magnificent Seven – 30 Years Later). On December 2009, Croatia records, the heir of Jugoton, released the double compilation album The Ultimate Collection, the only one so far to feature the selected material from all the studio releases, and the song selection for the album was provided by Miloš Ivanović \\"Kepa\\", the music editor of Radio B92. On 11 January the following year, the band celebrated their 30th anniversary at the Belgrade Akademija club, featuring the premiere of the new single, the song \\"Nemaš nikome ništa da daš\\" (\\"You Have Nothing To Share\\"), with the entire concert being available for live Internet streaming. Eight years since the release of the previous studio album, the album To što vidiš to i jeste (What You See Is What You Get), was released in early September 2010, under the Belgrade Dom Omladine label, with Telekom Srbija as the main distributor for the first two months. Produced by Vojislav Aralica, who also recorded percussion sections, the album featured seven songs, including \\"Pokaži mi\\" (\\"Show me\\") and \\"Nikad ne znam\\" (\\"I never Know\\") on which as guest guitarist appeared the former Katarina II member Dragomir Mihajlović \\"Gagi\\". In a month's period during which the promotion had lasted, the album was sold in 50,000 copies. On 1 November of the same year, the single \\"Nemaš nikome ništa da daš\\" appeared on the first place of the Jelen Top Ten list, remaining on the first place for two weeks. The following month, the Croatian record label Dallas Records released an expanded edition of the album for the former Yugoslav territory, featuring three new studio tracks, \\"Mister Ministar\\" (\\"Mister Minister\\"), \\"Gde god odem\\" (\\"Wherever I Go\\") and \\"Da, da, da, da\\" (\\"Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes\\"), and the band went on a tour across Slovenia and Croatia. In January 2011, To što vidiš to i jeste was voted No. 7 on the list of Best Domestic Albums in 2010 by the readers of online magazine Popboks and No. 9 according to the Popboks critics. The following month, on 2 February, the band got the Oskar popularnosti award for the Best Serbian Rock Act in 2010. In May 2010, a deluxe edition of the album was released, containing a new song entitled \\"Sedam dana (je nekad dovoljno)\\" (\\"Seven Days (Is Enough Sometimes)\\"), live versions of the songs \\"Mentalno\\" (\\"Mentally\\"), \\"Ja želim promene (baby, baby, baby)\\" (\\"I Want Changes (Baby, Baby, Baby)\\") and \\"Kako bubanj kaže\\" (\\"As the Lot Says\\"), a cover of the Ekatarina Velika song \\"Krug\\" and edited versions of the songs \\"Nemaš nikom ništa da daš\\", \\"Mister Ministar\\", \\"Ti to možeš\\" and \\"Bliži suncu\\" with music videos for the same songs. In 2013, the band released the double live album Warszawa '81/Warszawa '13 for the Polish market only. The first disc of the album represents the reissue of Warszawa '81 live album, and the second the recording of the band's 2013 concert in Warszawa. In November 2015, the band released the single \\"Bio sam loš\\" (\\"I Was Bad\\"), in order to mark their 35th anniversary, at the same time announcing their new studio album, Gde smo sad? (Where Are We Now?). The band celebrated 35 years of activity with a Serbian tour, starting on 26 December with a concert in Belgrade Youth Center. On April 22, 2016, the band performed, alongside Riblja Čorba, Van Gogh, Piloti and Galija, on the opening of renovated Tašmajdan Stadium. At the end of 2016, Električni Orgazam released the live album Puštaj muziku! (Play the Music!), featuring the recordings from their 35th anniversary concert in Belgrade Youth Center. The album was released on vinyl only, in a limited number of copies. At the same time the band celebrated the 30th anniversary of Distorzija with a number of concerts in Serbia. At the beginning of June 2018, the band released their twelfth studio album, entitled Gde smo sad? (Where Are We Now?, through Mascom.

It is one of the most endangered distinct populations of giraffe, with 1,669 individuals estimated in the wild in 2016.  Taxonomy and evolutionary history  Rothschild's giraffes at Lake Nakuru National Park in Kenya Rothschild's giraffes at Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda The IUCN currently recognizes only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies. Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi was named after the Tring Museum's founder, Walter Rothschild, and is also known as the Baringo giraffe, after the Lake Baringo area of Kenya, or as the Ugandan giraffe. All of those living in the wild are in protected areas in Kenya and Uganda. In 2007, Rothschild's giraffe was proposed as a separate species from other giraffe. In 2016, Rothschild's giraffe was proposed as conspecific with the Nubian giraffe (elevated to full species), but that taxonomy has not been widely adopted.  Characteristics  The Rothschild's giraffe is easily distinguishable from other subspecies. The most obvious sign is in the coloring of the coat or pelt. Whereas the reticulated giraffe has very clearly defined dark patches with bright-whitish channels between them, Rothschild's giraffe more closely resembles the Masai giraffe. However, when compared to the Masai giraffe, the Rothschild's ecotype is paler, the orange-brown patches are less jagged and sharp in shape, and the connective channel is of a creamier hue compared to that seen on the reticulated giraffe. In addition, Rothschild's giraffe displays no markings on the lower leg, giving it the impression of wearing white stockings. Another distinguishing feature of Rothschild's giraffe, although harder to spot, is the number of ossicones on the head. This is the only Giraffa phenotype to be born with five ossicones. Two of these are the larger and more obvious ones at the top of the head, which are common to all giraffes. The third ossicone can often be seen in the center of the giraffe's forehead, and the other two are behind each ear. They are also taller than many other populations, measuring up to tall. Males are larger than females and their two largest ossicones are usually bald from sparring. They usually tend to be darker in colour than the females, although this is not a guaranteed sexing indicator.  Habitat and distribution  Isolated populations of Rothschild's giraffes live in savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands of Uganda and Kenya. They are possibly regionally extinct from South Sudan and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Ecology and behavior  Rothschild's giraffes mate at any time of the year and have a gestation period of 14 to 16 months, typically giving birth to a single calf. They live in small herds, with males and females (and their calves) living separately, only mixing for mating. The Rothschild's giraffes are tolerant of other animals around them as long as they don't feel threatened. For the most part, they are very friendly, but the males are known to engage in fights for mating. Since this species can mate all year long, those battles seem to be frequent.  Threats and conservation  Giraffes in general are classified as vulnerable. Very few locations are left where Rothschild's giraffe can be seen in the wild, with notable spots being Lake Nakuru National Park in Kenya and Murchison Falls National Park in northern Uganda.  In captivity  Various captive breeding programmes are in place – notably at the Giraffe Centre in Nairobi, Kenya – which aim to expand the gene pool in the wild population of Rothschild's giraffe. , more than 450 are kept in ISIS (international species information system) registered zoos (which does not include the Nairobi Giraffe Centre), making both it and the reticulated giraffe the most commonly kept phenotypes of Giraffa.International Species Information System (2011).

Its stated mission is \\"to transform human society through the most effective means possible, namely through training the youth in faith, reason, and virtue\\". The school is operated independent of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego and is the only school located within the Diocese that offers a complete K-12 education. St. Joseph Academy has been named by the Catholic High School Honor Roll as one of the top 50 Catholic High Schools in the United States for three consecutive years and carries a 99% college matriculation rate . The school is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges accredited school and formally approved by the Diocese of San Diego. Overview St. Joseph Academy's curriculum is taught using the Classical Christian education model, which emphasizes biblical teachings and incorporates the Trivium teaching method. Students typically score between the 85th and 99th percentile on national standardized achievement testing, and grade equivalent scores for K-12 average nearly three grade levels above the national average. The K-5 primary grades are taught using the Spalding Method. Primary grade teachers receive formal training in this method, which is child- centered and focuses on the physical and mental well-being of students. Grades 6-8 emphasizes fundamental skill acquisition; accordingly, teachers employ a direct approach to instruction so that the student clearly understands the goal of each lesson at its beginning. Moreover, a special emphasis is placed on the Socratic Method of learning where teachers skillfully question students to educe or draw forth student insight, analysis and expression. In addition, a unique feature of its middle school curriculum is the teaching of Latin, a practice which has largely been abandoned by most Catholic primary schools. St. Joseph Academy's High School's college preparatory curriculum is approved by the University of California and meets its entrance requirements. In addition, the high school offers an in-house SAT training course. In addition to a wide offering of extracurricular clubs, its recognized athletic program includes membership in the North County Parochial League for middle school and the California Interscholastic Federation (C.I.F.). for high school. Athletic activities include tackle football, flag football, volleyball, basketball, soccer, golf, and track. St. Joseph Academy is centered around its stated fidelity to the Magisterium of the Catholic Church. Aside from Religion being taught at every grade level, the entire school attends weekly Mass, which includes a monthly Tridentine Mass (traditional Latin Mass) offered by priests from St. Anne's Catholic Church. Priests from the Miles Christi religious order hear weekly confessions and offer students spiritual direction. History In 1995, two Catholic mothers desired a school in North County (San Diego area) that would provide their children with both solid academics and faith formation within an integrated K-12 curriculum. With the blessing of then San Diego Bishop Robert Brom, they founded Sierra Madre Academy in a small commercial building in San Marcos. Founded as Sierra Madre Academy, the school was renamed St. Joseph Academy in September 2008, when it moved to its new, full-sized campus. During its first year, 25 students attended in grades one through nine. There were four full-time paid teachers, two volunteers teachers, a volunteer secretary, and a principal who also served as teacher. In the second year, with word of mouth as its only marketing tool, the school tripled its enrollment to 77 students. In 1997, to accommodate more students, the school leased additional space at another commercial building across a vacant field from the original school building to create at an \\"upper campus\\". The school housed grades K-3 in its original space, the \\"lower campus,\\" while the upper campus was home to grades 4-12. Each year, more space was leased at the upper campus until there was a classroom for each grade and one computer classroom. In 2000, to expand its athletic and recreational opportunities, the school negotiated a lease for a vacant lot between the two campuses. With all- volunteer labor and mostly donated materials, parents and other supporters cleared the lot, fenced in the area, installed irrigation, and planted grass. At the same time, portions of the upper campus parking lot were fenced off for a basketball court. In the 2004-05 school year, enrollment reached 189 students. Shortly thereafter, enrollment reached maximum capacity of 200 students, which prompted the need for an expanded campus. New Campus On September 10, 2008, St. Joseph Academy opened a new campus located on Las Flores Drive in San Marcos, California. The new, , 13-classroom campus allowed the school to increase enrollment to 350 students. In 2015, after receiving approval from city officials, the school embarked on a capital campaign to raise funds for Phase II of its campus, which will include science labs, additional classrooms, and a full-size gymnasium. Teachers St. Joseph Academy's teachers come from a wide variety of professional backgrounds, including pontifical academia, law, the armed forces, government, and science. This diversity of backgrounds and experience provides the students with varied styles of learning as well as an exposure to real-world skills and applications. Teachers have received degrees from many prestigious universities and colleges, including Michigan State University, University of Notre Dame, University of California, San Diego, Indiana University, Purdue University, Loyola Marymount, University of Dallas, Franciscan University of Steubenville, Thomas Aquinas College, Jamestown College, University of San Diego, and the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) in Italy. Advisory Board St. Joseph Academy's Advisory Board includes many prominent Catholic leaders, including Fr. Joseph Fessio, S.J., Fr. David Morrier, Dr. Scott Hahn, Fr. C. John McCloskey III, STD, Tim Staples, Barbara McGuiggen, Karl Keating, Dr. John W. Galten, Terri Barber, the Rev. Charles Wright, OSB, and Rev. T. Henry, TOR. Graduates Graduates have been accepted at universities including University of St. Andrews, UCLA, UC Berkeley, University of Glasgow, Purdue University, University of Edinburgh, Catholic University of America, Rochester Institute of Technology, Franciscan University of Steubenville, Virginia Tech, George Mason University, University of Dallas, Thomas Aquinas College, Christendom College, Merrimack College, and Cebu Doctors' University in the Philippines.

This Constitution, which would come into effect following Scotland's transition to independence, would set out the rights of citizens of an independent Scotland, and define the powers and responsibilities of government and parliament.  Historical background  The 2002 paper represents the culmination of many years' work. The essential elements of the Constitutional Policy were first adopted at the SNP's National Conference in 1977. The original drafting committee was convened by the late Dr Robert McIntyre, assisted by Professor Neil MacCormick, Dr Allan Macartney, Peter Chiene, Kenneth Fee, Isobel Lindsay and Barbara Park. The spirit of the original proposal has been retained in subsequent revisions, including a substantial review in 1990–1991.  Aims and principles  The SNP Draft Constitution declares itself to be necessary \\"to protect the rights of every Scottish citizen and to place restrictions on what politicians can and can't do\\". The draft \\"envisages an inclusive Scotland that embraces its geographic and cultural diversity, where its citizens are free from discrimination on any grounds in the exercise of their constitutional rights\\". The intention is to \\"give voice to the Scottish people and provide the means for us to take control of the decisions affecting our lives\\".  Article One: Constitution and People  Article One, entitled \\"Constitution and People\\" sets out some of the foundations of the Scottish State, including: (1) The right of the people of Scotland to self-determination and national sovereignty. (2) A declaration of Scotland's territorial claims to the mainland and islands of Scotland, and to Scotland's offshore (oil and gas) resources. (3) A declaration of constitutional supremacy: the Constitution is the supreme law and any other legislation which is incompatible with the Constitution will therefore be null and void. (4) An inclusive definition of citizenship, with reserved rights of residency for non-citizens resident in Scotland at the time of independence. Voting is from age 16. Note that there is no preamble or declaration of principles, and no mention of Scotland's flag, anthem, or capital.  Article Two: Head of State and Executive  Article Two sets out the arrangement for the Head of State and the Executive: (1) The Queen (Her Grace Queen Elizabeth I of Scots) would be retained as Head of State, with the title of \\"Queen of Scots\\". The Union of 1603 – a personal union between the Scots Crown and that of England – would thereby be maintained, even though the Union of 1707 – a governmental union of two States and two Parliaments – would be dissolved. (2) The Constitution for Scotland states that the monarch would hold title under the law of Scotland, so presumably the Parliament of Scotland could, at some future time, alter the law of succession in such a way that this personal union is dissolved. A Scottish Parliament would also be able, if it so desired at some future time, to remove the religious proscriptions which ban Roman Catholics from inheriting the Crown under the Act of Settlement. (3) Executive powers are vested in the Head of State, who is expected and required to act on the advice of the Prime Minister and Ministers. The Prime Minister is to be elected by Parliament, and Ministers are to be confirmed by Parliament. The government as a whole is accountable to Parliament by means of a motion of confidence, in accordance with the rules of the parliamentary system. (4) When the Queen is not present in Scotland, the elected Presiding Officer (i.e. Speaker) of Parliament would act as Head of State. The SNP is committed to holding a referendum on the future of the monarchy within the first term of a post-independence Parliament, but no explicit provision for this is made in the proposed Constitution.  Article Three: The Legislature  Article Three makes provision for a Parliament of Scotland, which will possess legislative (law making) power, as well as being responsible for debating policies and holding the Executive to account. The Constitution makes a number of breaks from British constitutional practice which were seen as radical in the 1970s but are, according to the SNP's Policy Paper, now accepted as part of Scottish political life: (1) The Parliament of Scotland will be unicameral, in keeping with the tradition of the old Scottish Parliament before 1707 and that of the Devolved Scottish Parliament today. (2) The Parliament will be elected by proportional representation. The SNP favours the Single Transferable Vote system, but the exact electoral system used will be determined by ordinary legislation. (3) Parliament elected for four-year fixed terms. Early dissolution is permitted only if a government enjoying parliamentary support cannot be formed: the Prime Minister cannot dissolve Parliament at will. Parliament may also extend its term of office, in times of war, for up to one year. (4) To compensate for the lack of a second chamber, a minority veto procedure (whereby two-fifths of the members of Parliament can delay a bill for up to a year, subject to the right of the majority to refer the bill to the people in a referendum) is included. This is intended to prevent rash legislation by a Parliamentary majority. (5) A stronger committee system will also be instituted, with pre-legislative scrutiny of legislation in parliamentary committees, although the Constitution is sparse on detail. (6) Parliament would have control over declarations of war and the ratification of treaties. Treaties which amend the Constitution (e.g. treaties of European integration) must be passed by a three-fifths majority in Parliament and ratified by a national referendum.  Article Four: Local Government  Article Four recognises and guarantees the independence of elected local Councils, which are also to be elected by proportional representation. The Islands authorities (Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles) also have certain guaranteed privileges which may not be removed by ordinary legislation. Note: the constitutionally guaranteed status of local Councils was not included in the 1977 document, but has been included in the 2002 version.  Article Five: The Judiciary  The Constitution recognises the independence of the judiciary: (1) Judges are to be appointed by the Head of State on the advice of an independent appointments commission, consisting of the Lord Advocate, the Presiding Officer of Parliament, a Senator of the College of Justice and two impartial members elected by Parliament. (2) Judges may only be removed from office, for misconduct, by a two-thirds majority vote of Parliament.  Article Six: Fundamental Rights and Liberties  The Constitution entrenches a number of fundamental rights and liberties, including freedom of speech, religion, assembly, movement, privacy, fair trial, due process etc. These are based on the European Convention on Human Rights. Social and economic rights, such as entitlements to public housing, unemployment benefit, pensions, public healthcare, and education, are included, but there is no protection for trial by jury and no rule preventing double jeopardy. The rights and liberties guaranteed in the Constitution may be waived during a State of Emergency. A State of Emergency must be approved by a three-fifths majority of the members of Parliament within two weeks, and may continue for up to three months, after which it must be renewed by Parliament.  Article Seven: Amendments  The Constitution may be amended by a three-fifths majority vote of Parliament, subject to approval by a majority of the people in a referendum.  Other noteworthy features  (1) The SNP draft Constitution is noticeably shorter than most modern (post-1945 and post-1989) European Constitutions, at around 6000 words. (2) The relationships between the Executive and the Parliament are not clearly defined, particularly with regard to the election of a Prime Minister and the procedure for votes of confidence. This leaves scope for the regulation of these matters by law, standing orders of Parliament, or, in the absence of such provision, by existing parliamentary custom. (3) In contrast to contemporary European practice, the SNP's Constitution for Scotland does not clearly distinguish between the respective roles of the Head of State and the Executive (compare with the Constitutions of Spain or Sweden, where such a distinction is explicitly made). (4) The Constitution does specify the size of Parliament, only that it must be at least four times the size of the Executive (the number of Ministers is limited to one-fifth of the members of Parliament). (5) The qualifications for membership of Parliament, and any incompatibilities between membership of Parliament and other public offices, are unspecified. These matters are subject to determination by Parliament, in accordance with the usual legislative process. (6) There is no mention in the Constitution for an Auditor-General or an Ombudsman, although both institutions currently exist in Scotland under Statute law. There is provision for Freedom of Information, but no reference to the Scottish Information Commissioner.

In 1981, Greg is a senior in high school while Jenny is only fifteen) #Economic backgrounds (they come from different economic backgrounds; Jenny is working-class while Greg comes from a rich family in Pine Valley) #Ex-girlfriend (Greg's ex-girlfriend, Liza Colby, refuses to allow Greg and Jenny to be happy together and schemes to displace Jenny at all costs) #Parents (Greg's mother, Enid Nelson, is a snob who thinks that Jenny is not good enough for her son) Storyline Greg and Jenny build slowly on their romance due to the four obstacles. In 1982, Liza almost succeeds in winning Greg back, but Jenny returns from vacation and his infatuation with Jenny grows even stronger. Liza rigs the Miss Junior Pine Valley contest so that she will win instead of Jenny; this does not deter Greg, who eventually tells Jenny that he loves her and wants to marry her. Jenny eventually finds out that her father, Ray Gardner (Gil Rodgers), who she thought was in prison for kidnapping is in fact in prison for rape. Liza finds out about this, and threatens to tell Greg unless Jenny withdraws herself from his life. Jenny runs away to New York City, followed by her friend Jesse Hubbard (Darnell Williams), who has been falsely accused of attempted rape by Liza, who hates him for his friendship with Jenny. Jesse saves Jenny from being forced into making a pornographic movie, and the two stand up for each other against the odds in the big city. Their summer in New York is considered one of the greatest storylines in the history of All My Children. Trying to forget Jenny, Greg begins to date Amanda (Amanda Bearse), Liza's longtime best friend who occasionally participated in Liza's scheming but is generally a much kinder person. Amanda realizes Greg is still in love with Jenny and discovers her current whereabouts which Liza persuades her to keep a secret from him. Ultimately, Amanda cannot play Lizaesque games and tells Greg where he can find Jenny. Jenny and Greg are reunited, as are Jesse and his love, Angie Baxter (Debbi Morgan). Greg suffers a fall in 1983 and is paralyzed from the waist down. He wants the best for Jenny, so he breaks up with her romantically and encourages her to go to New York and pursue modeling. Jenny goes to the big city and eventually is engaged to another model, Tony Barclay (Brent Barrett), even though she still loves Greg. When Greg regains the use of his legs in 1984, he goes to see Jenny so that he can salvage what they had together. They reconcile and Jenny breaks her engagement to Tony. Shortly thereafter, Greg and Jenny are married. Tony is angry that Greg has come back into Jenny's life, so he plots to kill him. Tad Martin (Michael E. Knight), Jenny's biological brother, schedules a day of fun for Greg and Jenny at Willow Lake, just outside town. Tony wires Greg's jet ski to explode, but at the last minute, Jenny gets on the jet ski instead and she ends up being the victim. She dies at Pine Valley Hospital at the age of 20,In the May 20, 2008 episode of All My Children, Jenny's dates of birth and death are firmly established as January 20, 1964 and August 13, 1984, respectively. with Greg at her side.Although ABC preempted most of its daytime line-up in early August 1984 to accommodate its coverage of the Summer Olympics, Jenny's injury and death was considered to be such a compelling storyline that the network chose to air the episodes without preemption. A few weeks later, Greg thinks that he has seen Jenny again, but it turns out to be a girl named Sheila (played by Cynthia Sullivan) who has been hired by Jenny's former modeling agent Olga Svenson as a publicity stunt. Greg becomes involved with Sheila, but the audience balks at their quick and contrived romance in the wake of Jenny's untimely death. In a late December 1984 scene (the last appearance of Sheila), Greg and Sheila are shown having sex beneath a thermal blanket on the floor of Sheila's apartment. In a rather graphic scene for daytime, Greg is shown thrusting back and forth on top of Sheila, and moaning, \\"Jenny, Jenny,\\" while the camera pans to Sheila's shocked face. Sheila's landlord Myrtle Fargate later tells Greg that Sheila has left town because she realizes he never loved her; he was only trying to use her to repress his grief over losing Jenny. Two years later in 1986, Greg leaves Pine Valley for Washington, and in 1994, Jenny returns as a ghost (seemingly accompanied by the ghost of a deceased Jesse), to help Tad escape the twister, in which the Martin house is destroyed. Tad does indeed escape. The ghosts subsequently return to Heaven. However, it is revealed in early 2008 that Jesse did not die, but rather that he was kidnapped and that his abductors faked his death. After Jesse returns to Pine Valley and is revealed to be alive, he and his former wife, Angie, plan an extravagant wedding (since their marriage was dissolved when Jesse was declared dead). One of the invited wedding guests is Greg. Before the wedding (on May 20, 2008), they visit Jenny's grave and remember the good times spent with her. While alone, and with tears in his eyes, Greg says that he never stopped loving her. He places a single red rose at her tombstone and walks away with his friends. Greg later gets shot at the wedding but survives. Greg appeared on Hayley Vaughan Santos' documentary about Pine Valley on January 5, 2010 and spoke of his love for Jenny. Reception and impact The Museum of Broadcast Communications summarized the impact of Agnes Nixon's Greg and Jenny love story: The museum cites Nixon as \\"queen\\" of contemporary soap opera and notes that she is best known and most honored for introducing social issues into soap operas. Greg and Jenny are considered to be one of the couple's that made up the core stories of All My Children for a few years. Columnist Lisa L. from TV Fan Online published an article about what makes supercouples, and used Greg and Jenny as a prime example. Soap Opera Digest took notice to the pairing back in the 1980s and still credits them today as one of soap opera's greatest love stories. Actress Kim Delaney's decision to exit the show All My Children at the height of her popularity affected fans. Delaney's character was given what is considered \\"daytime drama's highest honor\\" when her character was killed off so that no other actress could be cast in the role. Penn State School of Theatre commented on the Greg and Jenny story when mentioning actor Laurence Lau. The university stated, \\"Over the years Lau has appeared in guest starring roles in prime time television series, including Law & Order, Frasier, Diagnosis Murder, Brimstone, Martial Law, and a recurring role on the hit series JAG. Lau has also had long-term contract roles on the daytime series One Life to Live, Another World, and All My Children, where he will always be remembered as one half of All My Children's most beloved high school super couple Greg and Jenny.\\" In 2008, About.com noted the \\"lasting memory\\" of the couple: See also *List of supercouples References Further reading * * Nelson, Greg and Jenny Category:Soap opera supercouples Nelson, Greg and Jenny Nelson, Greg and Jenny ","title":"Greg Nelson and Jenny Gardner"},{"id":"10736678","text":"Street-level sign for Mars 2112 near Times Square Mars 2112 (pronounced \\"Mars twenty-one twelve\\") was one of many tourist-targeted restaurants in the Times Square district of New York City, based on future space travel and accommodations.

It was first published in paperback by Ballantine Books as the thirty-third volume of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in August, 1971. It has been reprinted a number of times since, and gathered together with Walton's other Mabinogion novels by Overlook Press as the omnibus The Mabinogion Tetralogy in 2002. The novel has also been published in translation in several European languages. The other three novels in the series are The Island of the Mighty (1936), The Song of Rhiannon (1972), and Prince of Annwn (1974). The novel is a retelling of the story of the Second Branch of the Mabinogion, Branwen Ferch Llŷr (Branwen, Daughter of Llŷr). Plot summary Britain is ruled by the children of Llyr and Penarddun, the giant King Bran and his siblings Branwen and Manawyddan, together with their younger half-brothers Nissyen and Evnissyen, the offspring of Penarddun and Euroswydd. Branwen is given in marriage to Matholuch, king of Ireland. Angry that he was not consulted, Evnissyen, a tragic and haunted figure, insults Matholuch by mutilating his horses. Bran placates the Irish king by compensating him with new horses and treasure, including a magical cauldron which can restore the dead to life. Back in Ireland, Matholuch and Branwen have a son, Gwern, but Evnissyen's insult continues to rankle the Irish and Branwen is banished to the kitchen and beaten every day. Finally she gets a message to Bran, who responds by making war on Matholuch. His army sails across the Irish Sea, but Bran is so huge he wades across. The fearful Matholuch offers peace and agrees to step aside as king of Ireland in favor of Gwern. Matholwch builds a house big enough to entertain Bran. His followers, unrepentant, conceal themselves in the house inside a hanging hundred bags, supposedly containing flour. Evnissyen, suspecting treachery, reconnoitres the hall and kills the hidden warriors by crushing their heads inside the bags. Later, at the feast, the angry Evnissyen throws Gwern into the fire, precipitating a battle. The fighting goes against Bran's forces, as the Irish use the magic cauldron to revive their dead. Evnissyen hides among the corpses to have himself thrown in the cauldron, which destroys it, although the effort costs him his life and comes too late for the combatants, almost all of whom are now dead. Only Branwen and seven of Bran's followers survive, notably Manawyddan and Pryderi, prince of Dyved. Bran himself is mortally wounded. Bran instructs his mourning companions to cut off his head and take it back to Britain. Branwen dies on their return, grief-struck from the ruin caused on her account. Bran's head, magically preserved, continues to live for a time, comforting and entertaining his adherents in a series of enchanted feasts before burial. Of all the children of Llyr only Manawyddan remains.

Holtzman, 414 U.S. 1321 (1973), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States involving the Constitution's War Powers Clause. The Court reversed a ruling by Justice William O. Douglas ordering the military to stop bombing Cambodia.  Background  On April 29, 1970, President Richard Nixon ordered the Cambodian Campaign, a secret military invasion lacking congressional approval.David Jeremiah Barron & Marty Lederman, The Commander in Chief at the Lowest Ebb - A Constitutional History, 121 Harv. L. Rev. 941 (2008). Congress responded by passing the Cooper–Church Amendment, which defunded the invasion. Assistant Attorney General William Rehnquist wrote an Office of Legal Counsel memorandum advising that the Constitution's Commander in Chief clause should authorize President Nixon’s campaign anyway,Memorandum from William H. Rehnquist, Assistant Att’y Gen., Office of Legal Counsel, to Charles Colson, Special Counsel to the President 20 (May 22, 1970). and Rehnquist testified as to such before the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs.Congress, the President, and the War Powers: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on National Security, Policy and Scientific Developments of the H. Comm. on Foreign Affairs, 91st Cong. 216 (1970). President Nixon then began Operation Freedom Deal, an extensive bombing campaign over most of Cambodia. In June 1973, Congress voted to discontinue funding of all combat activities in Cambodia.http://law.jrank.org/pages/13562/Schlesinger-v-Holtzman.html President Nixon vetoed the bill, which Congress narrowly failed to override.Louis Fisher, Unchecked Presidential Wars, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1637 (2000). Congress and the President then agreed to the compromise Case–Church Amendment, which would end all bombing on August 15, 1973. Brooklyn Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman voted against the compromise, then sued Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger to immediately stop the bombings.Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 484 F.2d 1307 (2d Cir. 1973). On July 25, U.S. District Judge Orrin Grimmell Judd granted summary judgment for Congresswoman Holtzman and issued a permanent injunction ordering the military to refrain “from participating in any way in military activities in or over Cambodia or releasing any bombs which may fall in Cambodia.”Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 361 F. Supp. 553 (E.D.N.Y. 1973). Judge Judd gave the military until Friday, July 27, before his order would come into effect. On July 27, a unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a stay of Judge Judd’s order until the next scheduled sitting of the court.Eugene R. Fidell, Why Did the Cambodia Bombing Continue?, 13 GREEN BAG 2D 321 (2010). Supreme Court Congresswoman Holtzman next applied to Justice Thurgood Marshall, the Circuit Justice assigned to oversee the Second Circuit, to vacate the stay. Justice Marshall declined to order the military to stop bombing, writing \\"the proper response to an arguably illegal action is not lawlessness by judges charged with interpreting and enforcing the laws. Down that road lies tyranny and repression.\\"Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 414 U.S. 1304 (1973) (Marshall, J., in chambers). The Court was in recess for the summer but the Congresswoman reapplied, this time to outspoken war critic Justice William O. Douglas.Moses, James L.. 1996. “William O. Douglas and the Vietnam War: Civil Liberties, Presidential Authority, and the \\"Political Question\\"”. Presidential Studies Quarterly 26 (4). [Wiley, Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress]: 1019–33. Justice Douglas met with the Congresswoman’s ACLU lawyers at his home in Goose Prairie, Washington and promised them a hearing the next day. On Friday, August 3, 1973, Justice Douglas held a hearing in the Yakima federal courthouse, where he dismissed the Government’s argument that he was causing a “constitutional confrontation” by saying, “we live in a world of confrontations. That’s what the whole system is about.” That night, Justice Douglas ordered the military to stop bombing, reasoning “denial of the application before me would catapult our airmen as well as Cambodian peasants into the death zone.”Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 414 U.S. 1316 (1973) (Douglas, J., in chambers). The U.S. military ignored the new Supreme Court order. Six hours later the eight other justices unanimously overturned Douglas’s ruling, after reconvening by telephone for a special term.Schlesinger v. Holtzman, 414 U.S. 1321, 1322 (1973) (Douglas, J., dissenting in chambers). The Court said it cannot decide a political question; the U. S. Constitution vests military matters in the Executive and Legislature.  Subsequent developments  On August 6, the military accidentally bombed Neak Leung, killing at least 137 villagers. The Second Circuit heard argument of the appeal on Wednesday, August 8, and later that day, Circuit Judge William Hughes Mulligan joined by Circuit Judge William H. Timbers, reversed Judge Judd’s order and dismissed Congresswoman Holtzman's lawsuit. Circuit Judge James L. Oakes dissented, citing Federalist No. 69. On August 15, all direct U.S. military involvement in Indochina ended. The substantive case never reached the Supreme Court. Congress next passed the War Powers Resolution, which requires the President to receive congressional approval for all new hostilities after sixty days. President Nixon vetoed the resolution, which Congress overwhelmingly overrode on November 7, 1973. = Significance = This case is significant because it challenges the legality of being able to operate the military on a \\"neutral\\" site. This case emphasizes the proper role of the judiciary to refrain from deciding political questions that are for the President and Congress to decide. Congress has declared war only 11 times and in only five wars: three times in 19th century wars, twice in World War One, and six times in World War Two, although the United States has had over 240 imperfect wars which were not declared, and these date back to President George Washington.

It was essentially a single-seat version of the B.E.2. Intended for use as a long-range reconnaissance and bombing aircraft, the B.E.12 was pressed into service as a fighter, in which role it proved disastrously inadequate, mainly due to its very poor manoeuvrability. Development The B.E.12 was essentially a B.E.2c with the front (observer's) cockpit replaced by a large fuel tank, and the 90 hp RAF 1 engine of the standard B.E.2c replaced by the new 150 hp RAF 4. Aviation historians once considered the type a failed attempt to create a fighter aircraft based on the B.E.2 – that was improvised and rushed into service to meet the Fokker threat. Many writers perpetuate this view or something like it. J.M. Bruce, on the other hand, has pointed out that this is simplistic at best and doesn't fit historically.Bruce 1968, V. 2 p.20. The prototype (a modified B.E.2c airframe fitted with the more powerful 150 hp (112 kW) RAF 4a air-cooled V12 engine) was already in the process of conversion in June 1915, while the Fokker scourge cannot be said to have started before the first victory by a Fokker E.I on 1 August, when Max Immelmann shot down a British aircraft that was bombing Douai aerodrome. At the time the B.E.12 was conceived the necessity for an aeroplane to defend itself was by no means as clear as it became later. The idea of dispensing with defensive armament altogether and replacing the observer's seat with extra fuel capacity and/or bombload was typified by several contemporary designs, such as the bomber versions of the Avro 504, and Sopwith 1½ Strutter. In any case the B.E.12 cannot have been produced specifically as an \\"answer\\" to the Fokker. In mid-1915 there was no way for a British single-seat tractor aircraft to carry a forward-firing armament as the Vickers-Challenger \\"interrupter\\" gear did not exist until December and was not available in numbers until the following March. The latest Royal Aircraft Factory single- seat fighter of the time, the F.E.8, was a nimble little pusher – proving if nothing else that its designers were very well aware of the basic requirements of a successful fighter. Nor was the B.E.12 \\"rushed\\" into service as would have been relatively easy as it was a straightforward conversion of a type in production. Trials with the prototype continued through late 1915 and seem to have been mainly concerned with the development of the new RAF 4 engine, especially the design of a satisfactory air scoop. Cooling of the rear cylinders of the RAF 4, an air-cooled V12 and later the engine of the R.E.8, was always rather dubious. The type was also tested as a bomber. It was May 1916 (when the \\"Fokker scourge\\", as a period of German air superiority was over) that it was decided to fit a synchronised Vickers gun to the type, armament trials had already been undertaken with upward-firing Lewis guns, similar to those used by the night fighter version of the B.E.2c. The B.E.12a variant flew for the first time in February 1916 and had the modified wings of the B.E.2e. It was rather more manoeuvrable than the B.E.12 but was otherwise little improved. The B.E.12b used the B.E.2c airframe but had the 200 hp Hispano-Suiza engine. It was intended as a night fighter and carried wing mounted Lewis guns in place of the synchronised Vickers. Apparently it had a good performance but the engine was more urgently needed for the S.E.5a and very few B.E.12b fighters went into service with home defence squadrons. Some of those built may never have received engines. Operational Service The first B.E.12 squadron, No. 19 did not reach France until 1 August 1916. It was followed by the only other squadron to fly the type in France, No. 21, on the 25th. As might have been expected, the new type had all the inherent stability of the B.E.2c and when pressed into service as a fighter proved quite useless, especially in the face of the new German Halberstadt and Albatros fighters coming into service. It continued to be employed as a bomber but since an effective defensive gun could not be mounted it was too vulnerable and was finally withdrawn from all front line duties in France in March 1917. By the time the B.E.12a became available in numbers the B.E.12 had already proved to be unsatisfactory and this variant was never used operationally in France. Several Home defence squadrons flew B.E.12s, along with examples of the B.E.12a and B.E.12b variants. Its stability and range were obvious advantages in an aircraft that had to fly at night but its rate of climb was inadequate when called on to intercept the improved German airships of 1916/17, not to mention the aeroplane raiders that replaced them. The Zeppelin L.48 was shot down by a Home Defence B.E.12 on 17 June 1917 but otherwise there are few recorded successes of the type in this role.Bruce 1982, p. 395. In the Middle East theatre and in Macedonia, the B.E.12 and B.E.12a proved more useful – although typically as long range reconnaissance aircraft rather than as fighters. An exception to this rule was the machine of Captain Gilbert Ware Murlis Green of No. 17 Squadron who shot down several enemy aircraft to become the only B.E.12 ace. The B.E.12b served only with Home Defence squadrons; deliveries began in late 1917, but due to the more urgent need of the S.E.5a squadrons for their Hispano-Suiza engines many were probably either never fitted with engines, or completed as B.E.12s. Reproductions No original BE12s are known to exist but The Vintage Aviator Ltd in New Zealand has built an airworthy reproduction which is flown from the firm's Hood Aerodrome, Masterton base.

The gameplay is similar to that of the Puzzle League series, but with a more traditional Tetris-like gameplay where pieces fall from the top of the screen. Pieces come in three colors: red, yellow, and blue. Pieces commonly have a star on one end, or occasionally, a star on two ends. The aim of the game is to clear blocks from the playing field, by matching stars from same-coloured blocks. Players are rewarded for creating combos (which are called 'links') of piece clearances. The game ends when someone's piece level reaches the top of the playfield and is not cleared after three seconds. The one player 'story' mode revolves around moving around an island and playing against opponents who gradually become harder, and consists of playing against 9 opponents (although this can be adjusted). There are also activities that involve the player concentrating on a specific task within a time limit. These include getting a high score, a high number of links, surviving for as long as possible, and clearing a field in a short time.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Starsweep on their November 1, 1997 issue as being the twenty-second most-successful arcade game of the year.

It has been reported on pistachio in Greece, Iran, Russia, and is frequently a problem in California pistachio orchards severely infested by hemipteran insects. In a 1989 survey in California, fruit with stigmatomycosis were found in 90% of samples collected from late June to mid-September and from all growing areas.  Symptoms  Stigmatomycosis is characterized by a wet, smelly, rancid, slimy kernel. Kernels with stigmatomycosis can be 1) small, dark green and partially developed with a brown funiculus, 2) well-developed, dark green and rancid, or 3) full-sized but abnormal, being white or light yellow and jelly- like, with a lobed appearance. In contrast, symptoms of kernel necrosis, which is caused by large hemipterans, are dry, punky, brown areas in the kernel. Sometimes, kernel necrosis and stigmatomycosis symptoms can be present in the same fruit.  Causal organisms  Stigmatomycosis is caused by the filamentous fungi Ashbya gossypii, Eremothecium coryli (syn. Nematospora coryli), and Aureobasidium pullulans. All of them belong to the phylum of ascomycetes  Disease cycle and epidemiology  The fungi causing stigmatomycosis are associated with hemipteran insects of the stinkbug families Pentatomidae and Coreidae. Hemipterans are common pests in pistachio orchards, and up to ten species have been found in California pistachio orchards. Three common stinkbug pests, Thyanta pallidovirens (Western red-shouldered stinkbug), Chlorochroa uhleri, Chlorochroa ligata, and a leaffooted bug, Leptoglossus clypealis (Coreidae), experimentally transmitted E. coryli, which caused typical symptoms of stigmatomycosis in pistachio kernels. Symptoms first appear in late June after pistachio shells have hardened, but the disease becomes frequent in July through September, a period that coincides with kernel development. Smaller hemipterans, such as Lygus and Calocoris, may carry but not transmit the pathogens because they are unable to puncture the firm fruit pericarp after the second part of May. Stigmatomycosis and kernel necrosis are worse in orchards irrigated by sprinklers than in those irrigated by drip, microjets, or flood. This suggests either greater humidity requirements for infection, more activity of hemipterans in sprinkler- irrigated orchards, or more abundant pathogen propagules.  Control  Fungicides do not control stigmatomycosis but insecticides reduce hemipteran vector populations and the incidence of stigmatomycosis.  References  * Themis J. Michailides.

It is based on the company's 5400 \\"Seaburg\\" workstation chipset. The primary difference between Skulltrail and Intel's current and past enthusiast chipsets is a dual CPU socket design that allows two processors to operate on the same motherboard. Therefore, Skulltrail can operate eight processing cores on one system. The platform supports two Core 2 Extreme QX9775 processors (commonly mistaken for the Core 2 Extreme QX9770, which is the LGA775 counterpart), which operate at 3.2 GHz. Skulltrail was one of the first platforms to support SLI on chipsets not designed by Nvidia. It achieves this by including two NVIDIA nForce 100 PCIe 1.1 switch (two x16 to one x16) chips. The implementation of SLI supports Quad SLI technology, which is achieved through the use of two dual-GPU graphics cards from NVIDIA, including the GeForce 9800 GX2. This gives a total of four graphics processors. Owners of Skulltrail systems can also make use of up to four ATI graphics cards using ATI CrossFireX technology, which made SkullTrail the only platform (other than Intel X58 and P55 Chipset) to support both SLI and CrossFire with public drivers at the time of release. The HP Firebird 803 also supported SLI on one (proprietary, MXM) motherboard at the time, but the drivers were special and only available for Firebird hardware. Public demonstrations Intel demonstrated Skulltrail at the Fall 2007 Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, USA, and at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Skulltrail has a front side bus rate of 400 MHz (1600 MHz QDR), and was demonstrated with two 45 nanometer High-K processors running at 3.2 GHz. During the IDF, a 4.0 GHz phase cooled Skulltrail system was demonstrated. Then on October 22nd, 2007, the two processors were demonstrated running at 4.4 GHz with water cooling. They were demonstrated again on October 31, 2007, this time running at 5.0 GHz, with phase change cooling. On April 18, 2008 Tom's Hardware, reporting from an Overclocking Enthusiast site, reported that an overclocked speed of 6.006 GHz was achieved on an 8-core Skulltrail setup.

This is in part due to the lack of support for multi-core computing with many popular game engines at the time, in addition to the extremely high price of the components involved. The use of FB-DIMMs due to the workstation chipset has also been pointed at as a major limiting factor for Skulltrail.Kinky Luxury: Intel Skulltrail Platform Review Intel Skulltrail Unleashed: Core 2 Extreme QX9775 × 2 although this limitation can be mitigated by purchasing specially designed Kingston HyperX FB-DIMMS that have a lower latency than generic FB- DIMMshttp://www.legitreviews.com/article/724/1/ The base Skulltrail platform consists of an Intel D5400XS mainboard which cost upwards of US$600 when it hit the market as a standalone part. Computers based on the Skulltrail platform also require high-output power supplies for both the CPU and graphics cards, along with a computer chassis capable of accommodating the motherboard, which is based on an Extended ATX form factor design. However, Atomic has reported that they can accommodate cheaper Xeon server microprocessors that fit in the LGA-771 socket, which is corroborated by Intel's official processor support list.Intel Processors and Boards Compatibility Tool Intel's Skulltrail D5400XS motherboard is made with two nForce chips. The Skulltrail D5400XS motherboard is now just one of the motherboards available, along with motherboards with X58 and P55 chipsets, that runs both nVidia's SLI and ATI's Crossfire platforms out of the box with public hardware drivers.

Published in 1926 by Editorial Latina, it is markedly autobiographical in nature. The original manuscripts were written in the 1920s and were drafted by Arlt in the mountains of Córdoba, in a time when his wife, Carmen, who suffered complications from tuberculosis, needed to move to the mountains to recover from her illness. Arlt invested a considerable amount of money in businesses that did not grow, and had to accompany his wife, so he began work on \\"Mad Toy'. Upon his return to Buenos Aires, Arlt tried to publish his novel in the “Los Nuevos” (The New”) collection of the publisher Claridad, but the editor of the collection, Elías Castelnuovo, did not like the book. It was then when chance brought him to Ricardo Güiraldes, who, after hearing readings of the book, encouraged Arlt to continue looking for a publisher, and gave him a job as a secretary. Plot summary The book is narrated in first person and is cleanly constructed. The apprenticeship of the protagonist, Silvio Astier, develops in four separate episodes. In the first, “The Band Of Thieves,” Silvio, influenced by reading melodramas, and, perhaps more, by his deplorable position in society, founds the “Club of the Gentlemen of Midnight” with two other adolescents, which is dedicated to petty theft in the neighborhood. After a failure, the club stops its activities. In the second, “Work and days,” Silvio, after moving neighborhoods, finds work at a bookstore and moves to the house of don Gaetano, the owner of the store. There he sees terrible scenes of meanness and suffers several humiliations. At the end he tries to burn the bookstore that he works in, but fails and then leaves his post. In the third, “Mad Toy,” Silvio tries to attend the School of Aviation as a mechanic’s apprentice. At first he is accepted, and the school directors are surprised at his brilliance, but later, suddenly, they expel him, because they say they do not need intelligent people, but brutes for work. Following this, Silvio lives through a strange adventure with a homosexual in a miserable hotel room. After leaving, he buys a revolver and tries to commit suicide, but he fails at this too. In the fourth part, “Judas Iscariote,” the protagonist, a little older, has become a door-to-door paper salesman, a job that seems as vile and humiliating as all of his previous employments. He meets one of his partners in the “Club of the Gentlemen of Midnight” who has become a detective and “regenerated” in the fight for life. Silvio becomes friends with Rengo, a marginal character, who works as a caretaker for cars in the fair of Flores. Certain intimacy seems to flourish between Silvio and Rengo. Rengo tells Silvio about his plan to steal from Vitri, the engineer’s, house, who is the boss of Rengo’s lover. Silvio accepts the job. Later, almost mechanically, Silvio asks himself, “But what if I betray him?” Later, Silvio goes to see Vitri, betrays Rengo, who is arrested. Silvio has one final conversation with Vitri, in which he communicates his desire to move to the south of the country. This dark tradition does not have precedents in Argentinean literature. Arlt follows, perhaps unknowingly, the steps of the Marquis de Sade, and of the Count Lautréamont. The structure of the first three episodes are homologous: Silvio’s attempt to affirm himself as an individual (through antisocial acts in the first two cases and through a suicide in the third), and then he fails miserably. In the fourth episode, this game of opposites and interrelations complicates itself- Silvio seems to find the possibility of a human relationship with Rengo, and then he betrays him- this is the only time when he doesn’t fail, when he commits an act that is socially good but individually evil. Bitterly, the book closes and the reader suspects that there is salvation neither for Silvio nor for the society in which he lives. The book doesn’t explain the social situation, nor the thoughts of its characters; all explanation is given through action, and through the telling of the facts. In the first episode, fiction penetrates reality; the adventure novels are, at the same time, material and motive of the occurrences; life of the characters mimics the life of other characters, those of fiction inside of fiction. Movie adaptations \\"Mad Toy\\" was adapted for cinema twice: by José María Paolantonio in 1984 and by Javier Torre in 1998. Referring to the 1984 version, Alicia Aisemberg wrote that the movie “tried to capture Arlt’s writing in film. Some of the resources used were silence and still shots, the use of voice-over to represent the monologue of Asier, and a production that passes through dirty and miserable spaces that show a filthy reality. With respect to the 1998 version, the critic of Clarín, Rafael Granado said that it was a respectful, sensitive adaptation, loyal to the original (except for minimal modifications), which shows the director's admiration for the writer.

It was formed in 1947, and placed into suspended animation on 20 February 2015. The Regiment was based at Albemarle Barracks in Northumberland. As of 2011, the regiment was equipped with the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS). They will be the first unit to deploy the new Fire Shadow loitering munition; training has already begun and they were planned to take it to Afghanistan in 2012. The regiment deployed Batteries on Op Herrick and fired the first GMLRS rounds in theatre. Under Army 2020, the regiment was disbanded and its GMRLS launchers transferred to the other RA regiments and the Territorial Army. The regimental flag was lowered on 20 February 2015. History A stick of soldiers from 39 Regiment Royal Artillery rush to get onto a Wessex helicopter during an exercise in Cyprus in which the regiment practiced operating in the infantry role 39 Regiment RA was formed with the re-designation of 2 Medium Regiment RA in 1947. It was originally equipped with BL 5.5 inch Medium Gun and was first stationed in the Middle East and Africa. The Regiment left the Middle East in 1948 after an Emergency Tour to Palestine, where it deployed to Ayrshire and was re-equipped with the M59 155 mm Long Tom Gun. It converted to a 155mm Self Propelled Regiment in 1955 and deployed to Cyprus to support operations against EOKA with batteries based in Episkopi, Dhekhlia, and Jophinou in 1958. In 1960 the Regiment moved to support the BAOR, and was based in Dempsey Barracks in Sennelager for the next 35 years. Here its role was one of three Nuclear Regiments, and was equipped with Honest John Rockets and towed M115 203 mm howitzer. 75 Battery was placed in suspended animation and was replaced by H Battery (Ramsay's Troop) Royal Artillery in 1967. The Regiment was caught up in the Coup d'état by Captain Gaddaffi in Libya in 1969, and the Regiment's 2IC was captured and held hostage, but later released unharmed. There was a further reorganisation with 39 Medium Regiment using the M109 Howitzer and M110 Self Propelled Guns in 1972, and 132 Bty RA and 176(Abu Klea)Bty RA joining H Battery. The Regiment completed four tours of Northern Ireland over the next seven years. The regiment was redesignated 39 Field Regiment with H Bty, 132 & 176 Btys in 1977. 43 Bty joined Regt. equipped with Blowpipe. On 15 Mar 1980 the regiment was granted Freedom of the City of Paderborn, Germany. It was redesignated 39 Heavy Regiment was joined by 56(Olpherts) Bty RA, 34(Seringapatam)Battery and 76(Maude's)Battery in 1982. H Battery was placed into suspended animation and 132 Battery together with 176 Battery departed for the Royal School of Artillery at Larkhill. In 1985 132 Battery and 176 Battery rejoined the Regiment with the M110 Self Propelled Gun role and 56 Battery converted to a special weapons battery, equipped with the M109 Self Propelled Guns. Then in 1989 39 Heavy Regiment took delivery of the Multiple Launch Rocket System MLRS, and was given a year to convert, complete training and become operational. However, within just three months the Regiment was deployed to Saudi Arabia as part of 1st Armoured Division on Operation Granby. In 1993 the Regiment was joined by 57 (Bhurtpore) Battery Royal Artillery, who were to be equipped with the Phoenix UAV, and deployed to Cyprus, as the British detachment in UNFICYP. This tour saw the Danish and Canadian Contingents leave, with only the Austrians and the British left. Argentina then sent a force to control Sector One, the Austrians were in charge of Sector Three and the British in charge of Sector Two. This was the first time that British and Argentine army units had met since the Falklands war in 1982. In 1995 39 Regiment left Dempsey Barracks, and moved to Albemarle Barracks in Northumberland. In 1996 the regiment deployed again to Cyprus in support of UNFICYP. The island experienced some of its highest tension along the buffer zone in 30 years, and two of the Regiments soldiers were shot and wounded by Turkish Troops. The regiment deployed to Northern Ireland in 1998. The Regiment supported MAFF, in the North-East of the UK, during the Foot and mouth outbreak. 57 Battery deployed to Kosovo to carry out UAV flights in 2001. In 2003 57 Battery moved to 32 Regt RA, which was reorganised as one of the Royal Artillery Surveillance and Target Acquisition Regiments with its focus on UAVs; 74 Bty (The Battle Axe Company) joined 39 Regiment. 39 Regiment completed several tours of Northern Ireland in that period, as the Urban Reinforcement Battalion. It continued to support operations in the province, until the end of Operation Banner in 2007. Soldiers of the Regiment also deployed to Kuwait and Iraq as part of Operation Telic. In 2004 35 Bty RA joined 39 Regiment after the disbandment of 22nd Regiment Royal Artillery. The Regiment was also equipped with GMLRS in 2004.

Billboard ranked it as the No. 82 song for 1972.Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1972 The song laments the death of Fat Freddie, a character in the film who is run over by a car. Like most of the music from the Super Fly album, \\"Freddie's Dead\\" appears in the film only in an instrumental arrangement, without any lyrics. The song's music is featured prominently in the film's opening sequence and also recurs at several other points. Because of this usage the song was subtitled \\"Theme from Superfly\\" on its single release (but not on the album). It is not to be confused with \\"Superfly\\", a different song and the second single released from the Super Fly album. The arrangement is driven by a strong bass line, wah wah guitars, and a melancholy string orchestration. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Rhythm & Blues Song but lost to \\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\\". \\"Freddie's Dead\\" was ruled ineligible for the Academy Award for Best Original Song because its lyrics are not sung in the film Super Fly.

Preservation of magnetic audiotape comprises techniques for handling, cleaning and storage of magnetic audiotapes in an archival repository. Multiple types of magnetic media exist but are mainly in the form of open reels or enclosed cassettes. Although digitization of materials on fragile magnetic media in library and information science is a common practice, there remains a need for conserving the actual physical magnetic tape and playback equipment as artifacts. Structure of magnetic tape The first magnetic tapes were manufactured by BASF in Germany in 1932. They were designed with iron carbonyl as the magnetic pigment mixed into the cellulose acetate carrier. Production soon moved to iron oxide coated onto cellulose acetate rolls cut into uniform strips wound onto plastic or metal hubs. Recordists began recording sound on magnetic media in the twenties in the form of magnetic wire. After World War II, the advantages of tape in terms of sturdiness and the ability to edit by cutting and splicing made tape preferable to wire as the magnetic medium of choice. Tape consists of a coating of a magnetic pigment, typically iron oxide (Fe2O3), on a long strip of polyester (polyethelyne terephthalate) base film. This base film has been used since the mid-sixties as a replacement for acetate bases film that was prone to chemical instability. Sticky-shed syndrome A new problem with chemical stability became notable in the mid- seventies when two significant tape manufacturers changed their dispersion formulations by introducing a polyurethane binder that, in time, turned hygroscopic and broke down as it absorbed water molecules into the long hydrocarbon molecular chains. The tape coatings became sticky and shed oxide onto all tape recorder parts in their path, including heads, guides, rollers, and capstans. This is commonly called sticky-shed syndrome. Although the problem was confined to two of the four major tape manufacturers (neither BASF nor 3M studio tapes suffer from the problem because neither manufacturer used the hygroscopic binder), the reputation of all magnetic tapes has been tainted by the defect. Information can be recovered from the \\"stick-shed\\" tapes by heating them at a very low temperature in order drive the water out of the binders.Hall, Stephanie A. “Preserving Sound Recordings”. Save Our Sounds: America’s Recorded Sound Heritage Project. 27 April 2005 , 9 April 2007. The baking method is a one-time solution to the problem because the binder remains unstable. Tapes that do not show the breakdown syndrome do not need any special treatment. Handling It is advised that open reels are handled by the center hub area or by the outer edges of the reel flanges, if necessary, and that the actual tape is not touched. If the outer flanges must be used, do not squeeze the edges of the reel flanges together, as it will damage the edges of the tape. If possible, handle by the center hub only.(1997, October 29). Preservation of Recorded Sound Materials. Retrieved April 9, 2007, from Music Division: National Library of Canada Web site: Similarly, it is recommended that cassettes be handled by the existing outer plastic case and that fingers not be placed anywhere inside the cassette mechanism.Library of Congress, (2006, December 11). Cylinder, Disc, and Tape care in a nutshell. Retrieved April 9, 2007, from The Library of Congress: Preservation Web site: Cleaning Magnetic tape must be kept clean in order to prevent scratching and deterioration. Dust on the surface of tape will cause friction between the tape and the tape heads on the playback equipment, which will scratch the oxide layer. The website for sound preservation hosted by the National Library of Canada classifies dirt in two classes: Foreign matter (fingerprints, dust) and alteration of the original state (chemical reactions caused due to grime and dirt deposited on the tape surface). In any event, the tapes must be properly cleaned. Recommended methods for removing dust on tapes include using a small vacuum with a hose or wipe with 3M Tape Cleaning Fabric. Care must be used when using a vacuum if a hose attachment is available. If the motor of the vacuum is powerful enough, it can demagnetize the tape and the recording will be compromised. Many of the professional companies for tape restoration recommend professional help for proper care, naturally, as they want business. They are generally correct to recommend this, as it is a delicate process that requires training if one plans to undertake serious chemical or physical repair. Vidipax, a professional tape restoration company, recommends using Pellon fabric or cloth as the safest and most efficient way to clean tapes. They warn against using solvents at all costs unless the tapes have already been submerged in water or another solvent (in the case of a flood). They also remind tape-owners or collections managers that baking tapes to reverse hydrolysis is rarely a permanent fix and permanently alters the make-up of the tape.Vidipax, (2007). Magnetic Tape Restoration. Retrieved August 2, 2008, from the Vidipax Web site: Storage As is the case with any collection, proper storage is extremely important. The general environment, including temperature and relative humidity is key. The proper levels vary depending on how long the materials need to be stored. The Library of Congress recommends that any tapes needing preservation for a minimum of 10 years should be stored between at 45-50% relative humidity (RH). Large fluctuations in either of these factors should be avoided at all costs. If the tapes need permanent preservation, they should be stored at at 20-30% relative humidity. In the case of magnetic tapes, contrary to traditional preservation storage rules for books and photographic film, colder is certainly not better. If the collections are stored below , the tape lubricant can separate from the base, ruining the recording. The most important thing is to keep conditions consistent once desirable conditions are achieved. The National Library of Canada recommends that one and a half rounds of a previously unused tape should be cut off, so as to remove any adhesive at the end, which could later be transferred to the tape or machinery. They also recommend not storing any paper labels in the box with reel-to-reel tapes to prevent chemical transfer from the paper and/or printing processes used on the paper to the tape. The Library of Congress recommends that tapes with water repellent plastic containers be stored vertically on edge, not flat, and that reel-to-reel boxes need not be separated, but should be stored vertically with bookends, so as not to fall. Also, it is always important to remember that these collections will be very heavy and should be shelved on strong, non-acidic shelving. Tapes should only be rewound just before the next play. When rewinding, if possible, use a slower archival wind technique. Although super-speed rewinders may seem convenient, they will warp and damage tapes over time. Professional media librarians at the National Library of Canada suggest that the best way to achieve an archival wind for reel-to-reel tapes is to remove the heads on the player and play backwards at normal play speed. However, the tape tension may need to be adjusted after removing the heads. Digitization Sometimes, a tape may be so fragile that the only long-term method for preservation is to transfer the media to a digital format. However, all of the above precautions still must be taken with collections in order to achieve a proper transfer. The materials must be in good enough condition to play in order to be digitized; therefore, one should not count on digitization as a safety net.

Byrne made his first appearance for the team during the 1998 National League and became a regular member of the starting fifteen until he left the panel after the 2003 championship. During that time he won one All-Ireland medal and one All-Star award. Byrne was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Byrne played with the Kilcormac-Killoughey club. In retirement from playing Byrne became involved in team management and coaching. After spending two seasons as manager of the Offaly under-21 team he became a selector under Ollie Baker with the Offaly senior team. Playing career =Club= At club level Byrne has enjoyed some success with Kilcormac-Killoughey, winning a county intermediate hurling championship medal in 2006. =Inter-county= Byrne first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Offaly senior hurling team. He made his debut in a National Hurling League game against Antrim in 1998. Later that year he made his championship debut against Meath before lining out in his first provincial decider. Kilkenny provided the opposition on that occasion, however, a 3-10 to 1-11 defeat was Byrne's lot on that occasion. This defeat prompted the Offaly manager, Babs Keating, to describe the team as \\"sheep in a heap\\", and he promptly resigned. It looked as if Offaly's championship hopes were in disarray, however, they overcame Antrim in the All-Ireland quarter-final and qualified to meet Clare in the semi- final. The first game ended in a draw and had to be replayed, however, the replay was ended early because of a time-keeping error by the referee Jimmy Cooney. Following a protest on the pitch of Croke Park by the Offaly supporters it was decided that Clare and Offaly would meet for a third time. Byrne's side won the third game and qualified to play Kilkenny in the final. On that day Brian Whelahan delivered one of his greatest-ever Offaly performances, scoring 1-6. Offaly reversed the Leinster final defeat by winning the All-Ireland final by 2-13 to 1-16. It was Byrne's first All- Ireland medal. He was later honoured with an All-Star award while he was also named Eircell Young Hurler of the Year. Offaly surrendered their All-Ireland crown the following year but returned to the All-Ireland decider again in 2000 in a repeat of the Leinster final. Kilkenny's D.J. Carey capitalised on an Offaly mistake after just six minutes to start a goal-fest for \\"the Cats\\". Carey scored 2–4 in all, sharing his second goal with Henry Shefflin who also scored a goal in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 5–15 to 1–14. The next two seasons saw Offaly exit the provincial championship at an early stage. Byrne was dropped as first-choice goalkeeper in 2003 and left the panel after the completion of the championship. =Inter- provincial= Byrne also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial series of games.

The regiment's tactical groups can direct air, rocket, and artillery support from other formations, services, or allies.  History  In 1939, the Regiment was formed as 4th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) at Helmieh, Egypt on 28 May 1939. The original Batteries were C Battery, F (Sphinx) Battery, and G Battery (Mercer's Troop), drawn from independent commands in India and equipped with the Ordnance QF 25 pounder. During the Battle of Sidi Rezegh in the Western Desert on 23 November 1941, Brigadier John Charles Campbell, who only a few months earlier had been commanding 4th RHA, won the Victoria Cross. After World War Two, in 1947, 4th Regiment RHA was based in Germany at Dorset Barracks in Kiel. By 1948, the regiment moved to Alma Barracks at Blackdown Camp and in 1951, the regiment moved to Barracks at Hohne. In 1961, the Regiment became 4th Regiment, Royal Artillery, with three batteries moving to 33rd Parachute Light Regiment Royal Artillery, which immediately became 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. 4th Regiment RA gained 29 (Corunna), 88 (Arracan) and 97 Battery (Lawson’s Company) as gun batteries and was posted to Hong Kong. In 1965, the Regiment deployed on operations to the Malayan Peninsula. It saw active service from February to April and during the confrontation with Indonesia in Borneo until November.

By 1991, The Regiment undertook an emergency tour of Northern Ireland as the Tyrone Roulement Battalion. In 1994, it deployed to Belfast, Northern Ireland. Equipped with the AS90 gun and returning to Osnabruck in 1997, batteries of the Regiment deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2004, parts of the regiment deployed to Iraq for Operation TELIC 5 where they were involved in the reconstruction of Basra. Two years later, the Regiment deployed on Operation TOSCA on peacekeeping duties as part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). In 2007, the Regiment began its conversion to the 105mm Light Gun and then deployed for Operation HERRICK 7 in Afghanistan and later in 2008 it moved from Osnabrück to Topcliffe.

They are currently based at Albemarle Barracks, Northumberland, England. The regiment was constituted in 1939 out of existing batteries. Two of the batteries have served continuously since the 1790s. Two others have served continuously since their formation in the period 1805-1811 during the Napoleonic wars. M Battery, by contrast, has served continuously since 1993. History =Formation= The basic organic unit of the Royal Artillery was, and is, the battery. Prior to May 1938, when grouped together they formed brigades, in the same way that infantry battalions or cavalry regiments were grouped together in brigades. At the outbreak of the First World War, a field artillery brigade of headquarters (four officers, 37 other ranks), three batteries (five and 193 each), and a brigade ammunition column (four and 154) had a total strength just under 800 so was broadly comparable to an infantry battalion (just over 1,000) or a cavalry regiment (about 550). Like an infantry battalion, an artillery brigade was usually commanded by a Lieutenant-Colonel. After May 1938, brigades were redesignated as regiments and on 27 August 1938, III Brigade Royal Horse Artillery at Abbassia, Egypt was redesignated as 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. Also in 1938, artillery brigades were reorganized from three six-gun batteries to two 12-gun batteries. Rather than disband existing batteries, they were instead linked in pairs. As a result, D and J Batteries formed D/J Battery on 11 May 1938 and M and P Batteries were linked as M/P Battery on the same date. This was the regiment's structure on formation but in the event the batteries were unlinked within months (in September 1939) and the regiment operated with four batteries. =Second World War= British Victory Parade in Berlin: Salute fired by guns of the 3rd Royal Horse Artillery on the arrival of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. By the outbreak of the Second World War, the regiment was still in Egypt and on 16 October 1939 was assigned to Headquarters Royal Artillery Group (Middle East Reserve) as an anti-tank regiment armed with 2 pounder guns. M Battery, however, was permanently attached to the Armoured Division (Egypt) (later the 7th Armoured Division, the \\"Desert Rats\\"). In March 1941, P Battery left the regiment to join 6th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery in the United Kingdom. In practice just the title was transferred; the personnel and equipment were distributed amongst D, J and M batteries making them up to eight-gun units. On 1 March 1941, the regiment joined M Battery in 7th Support Group and all three batteries were redesignated as anti-tank. The regiment took part in the final attempt to lift the Siege of Tobruk, Operation Crusader (18 November10 December)notably the Battle of Sidi Rezegh where Second Lieutenant George Ward Gunn (J Battery) earned the Victoria Cross for his bravery during an attack by 60 German Tanks. On 26 April 1954, J Battery was awarded the Honour Title \\"Sidi Rezegh\\" in recognition of this action. The regiment was rearmed with 25 pounders after Sidi Rezegh, and the batteries were redesignated as field artillery on 8 September 1942. The regiment left the 7th Support Group on 8 February 1942 (the day before it was reformed as the 7th Motor Brigade) and was assigned directly to the 7th Armoured Division; it remained with the division for the rest of the war. The regiment supported the 7th Armoured Division during the rest of the Western Desert Campaign taking part in the Battle of Gazala (26 June21 June 1942), the Defence of the El Alamein Line (127 July), the Battle of Alam el Halfa (30 August7 September), and the Battle of El Alamein (23 October4 November). It then took part in the Tunisia Campaign including the Battles of Medenine (6 March 1943), Mareth (1623 March), Akarit (6 and 7 April), Enfidaville (1929 April), and Tunis (512 May). The regiment was withdrawn to Libya to rest and refit thereby missing the Sicilian Campaign. It next took part in the Italian Campaign: the Salerno Landings (918 September 1943), the Capture of Naples (22 September1 October), and the Volturno Crossing (1215 October). It then returned to the United Kingdom, arriving on 4 January 1944. It continued to support 7th Armoured Division, as a follow up formation, following the Normandy Landings In 1945, the regiment led the Allied Victory parade in Berlin, and fired the Victory Salute. =Post War= After World War II the regiment served in the UK, West Germany, Aden, Egypt, Kenya, Hong Kong and Cyprus. In 1958, C Battery joined the regiment, and M Battery was placed in suspended animation. By 1975, M Battery was revived. In 1976, the regiment completed another tour of Northern Ireland, as part of Operation Banner and later in 1978, the regiment was placed in suspended animation with batteries became independent anti-tank batteries. By 1984, the regiment was reformed in Paderborn, Germany. M Battery was once again placed in suspended animation. The regiment also served in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. and in 1993, N Battery (The Eagle Troop) joined the regiment, and M Battery was amalgamated with Headquarters Battery to form M Headquarters Battery. Furthermore, in 1999, the regiment deployed with UNPROFOR to Bosnia In December 2000 D Battery deployed as part of NATO’s KFOR to Kosovo on Op Agricola. Under Army 2020, it will provide force support to the Adaptable Force. In 2013 it re-rolled from AS-90s to L118 Light Guns. From 1 March 2015, the 105th Regiment Royal Artillery will be paired with this regiment. Under Army 2020 Refine the Regiment will support one of the new STRIKE Brigades, utilising the L118 Light Gun.

He served four terms as mayor of Nagasaki from 1979 to 1995. He publicly made controversial statements about the responsibility of Japan and its then-reigning Emperor for World War II and survived a retaliatory assassination attempt in 1990.  Biography  = Early life = Motoshima was born on February 20, 1922 in Shinkamigotō, Nagasaki. During World War II the Japanese authorities suspected Motoshima of espionage because he was a descendant of Kakure Kirishitans and born out of wedlock. When he was twenty-one he was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army and became an artillery officer; he was stationed near Kumamoto and did not see combat before the war ended. Motoshima witnessed the aftermath of the atomic bombing of his hometown when he returned to Nagasaki about six weeks after it was bombed.Kyoto Journal Spring 1991 interview He was admitted to the Kyoto University Engineering Department, but due to World War II did not graduate until he was twenty-seven years old. Motoshima worked as a teacher before entering politics. = Political career = Motoshima served as a Nagasaki Prefectural Legislature representative for five terms (twenty years) before being elected mayor of Nagasaki. While mayor he worked as chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party Nagasaki Prefecture Committee. Following the mayor's controversial remarks and an attempt on his life, in the 1991 mayoral election the Communist Party did not run their own candidate and essentially supported Motoshima, who won re-election to a fourth term with additional cooperation from other progressive forces. However, facing much criticism, Motoshima lost the 1995 election to Liberal Democratic Party-endorsed opponent, Iccho Itoh, and retired from politics. = Controversy and assassination attempt = In late 1988 during his third mayoral term, news that the Shōwa Emperor was gravely ill and not expected to live long had put Japan into a somber mood. On December 7 Motoshima was asked in a city council meeting by a council member from the Communist Party his opinion of the Emperor's responsibility for World War II. He answered: The Liberal Democratic Party Prefectural Committee immediately demanded that he retract the statement, but Motoshima rejected the demand, saying he could not betray his conscience. In response, the Party Prefectural Committee removed him from the post of committee advisor, and many conservative organizations vilified the mayor. Furthermore, many extreme right-wing groups converged on Nagasaki and demonstrated in the streets with more than eighty speaker trucks calling out for divine retribution upon the mayor. On January 18, 1990, when police had relaxed their guard on the mayor, a member of the right-wing group Seikijuku shot Motoshima in the back, but he survived the assassination attempt. = Retirement = In 1998 Motoshima again attracted controversy by making statements such as, \\"It was a matter of course for atomic bombs to have been dropped on Japan, which had launched a war of aggression. Japan does not have the right to criticize the atomic bomb.\\" for Kyodo News's interview. He is also quoted as saying, conversely, that the bombing was \\"one of the two great crimes against humanity in the 20th Century, along with the Holocaust\\"Japanese Mayors Call A-Bomb Attacks a Crime\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, 16 March 1995, p1. Retrieved on 12 June 2014.\\" In 2002 Motoshima was awarded both the first Korea/Japan Peace and Fellowship Prize and the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. On October 31, 2014, he died at the age of 92.

The show was created in 1952 by Wisconsin showman Tommy Bartlett as a traveling group of entertainers, based in Chicago, Illinois. After changing its base of operations to Wisconsin Dells, the performers continued to tour, performing at World's Fairs and U.S.O. shows. According to the show's official website, over 20 million spectators have seen the show since its creation. The Wisconsin Dells show was performed between late May and early September on Lake Delton. In keeping with the tourist-centered economy of Wisconsin Dells, the show operates regardless of rain, and was generally canceled only when weather is dangerous, rather than simply inclement. Despite the fact that the show took place entirely on the lake, Bartlett himself apparently only waterskiied once, on his 70th birthday, 32 years after the show's creation. In 1978, Tommy Bartlett named Thomas Diehl president of Tommy Bartlett, Inc. and sold him a 25% stake in the company. Diehl is now the president, general manager, and co- owner of Tommy Bartlett, Inc. He had joined the Bartlett organization in 1967, at the recommendation of NFL quarterback Joe Namath. On September 16, 2020 the show announced it would permanently close due to financial losses from the COVID-19 pandemic. 2008: Suspension after Lake Delton draining On June 7, 2008, the Bartlett show closed when Lake Delton, the body of water where the show takes place, flooded after torrential rains, and two days later, breached the embankment surrounding it, draining the lake almost completely, in particular the area of the show's grandstand. The show reopened on Thursday, June 12, but without its famous water skiers. They, like Lake Delton, were gone for the rest of the 2008 season.Associated Press video via The Wisconsin State-Journal: \\"The show must go on\\" Even with the land show that was put in place, 2008 show numbers were down almost 90%. The show was improvised with a beached island and by pulling legends like \\"Sound Effects Guy\\" Wes Harrison out of retirement. Tommy Bartlett's Needs Help Another setback occurred the first week of July, 2008. Many of Tommy Bartlett's employees live in trailers on company premises, as most are college students there for summer employment. On Wednesday, July 8, a fire broke out in one of the trailers, damaging four mobile homes on the premises, and causing $100,000 worth of damage.

It currently serves in the armoured field artillery role, and is equipped with the AS90 self-propelled gun. The regiment is currently based at Larkhill Garrison, Larkhill. The Regiment completed its move from Assaye Barracks, Tidworth to Larkhill in June 2019. History =Formation= The regiment was formed as 5th Brigade Royal Horse Artillery in March 1901 and was renamed 1st Brigade Royal Horse Artillery in October 1906. It served in Iraq in 1920, returned to the Uk in 1923 and served in Egypt in 1931, before returning to the UK again in 1936.

(IWM NA20334) In 1939, 1 RHA was part of 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, and fought at Saint Valery. The Regiment was captured after severe fighting, but some batteries managed to escape after the Battle of Dunkirk. The Regiment reformed and was deployed to Northern Africa in late 1940. The Regiment then arrived with the Middle East Command in October 1940 and took a large part in Wavell's Campaign which opened on 9 December 1940. The most notable actions were those during the Siege of Tobruk and all the batteries fought during the fierce fighting just before El Alamein and then the First and Second Battles of El Alamein itself. 1 RHA then joined 10 Armd Division in Aleppo and spent the next year training all over Syria, Palestine and the Suez Canal Zone. 1 RHA then landed in Italy from Palestine in May 1944 at Taranto, and were in action south of Rome on 15 May 1944 and thereafter played a full part in the remainder of the Italian Campaign and finished the war in Italy. =Cold War= The regiment saw service as follows: 1 RHA was stationed in Palestine after the Second World War, during the period of terrorist activity that led to the creation of the State of Israel. 1 RHA returned to England as part of 6th Armoured Division at Salisbury Plain in 1951. in 1952 1 RHA moved to Münster in West Germany, where they remained until 1958 as part of the 20th Armoured Brigade of 6th Armoured Division.

When the Cold War ended in 1990, the Options for Change reforms were published, and the regiment ordered back to England within the next two years. Another change was during the Gulf War, all three batteries, A, B, and E amalgamated to form A/B/E Bty for Gulf service.

It stars Ana Belén and Georges Corraface. The film is an erotic drama, an exploration of female sexual desire. Highly controversial, La pasión turca continues Spanish director Aranda's fascination with the dark side of love. The film became one of Spain's highest-grossing films of the 90s and received twelve nominations to the Goya Awards in 1995. Plot Desideria 'Desi' Oliván, a well to do woman from Ávila, Spain will marry Ramiro, a handsome young man from a solid background and promising future. The couple settle into a placid comfortable life. Ramiro is an attentive but not very passionate husband and after five years of marriage, they begin to worry that they still do not have children. During Ramiro's birthday party, Desideria, her husband and two more couples, decide to travel together to Turkey. While the group is in Istanbul Desi is smitten by the handsome Turkish guide, Yaman. Unable to suppress her passion, Desi begins a passionate affair with Yaman. They have sex in the tour bus and from then on Desideria takes advantage of every opportunity during the trip to escape into the arms of her lover. For the first time in her life, she find sexual fulfillment. After two weeks, the trip is over. Yet, Yaman vows to love his Spanish worshiper forever and the two part ways. Upon her return home, Desi can hardly concentrate, her thoughts are with Yaman. Her calm marital life has nothing in common with the torrid passion she found with her Turkish lover. She tries to contact him, but fails on her efforts. After a regular trip to the doctor, she learns that she is pregnant. Yet, it is not her husband's child, he is sterile. Desi is adamant to keep the baby despite her husband's protest. Ramiro knows that he cannot be the father. She offers to divorce him, but Ramiro agrees to support the child and the couple decides to stay together. Desi's son does not live long; the baby dies of high fever and convulsions. After the funeral, grieve stricken, Desi flees for Istanbul looking to forget the drama she is leaving behind and to be reunited with her lover. Once in Turkey, she starts to search for Yaman, and she finds him in Capadocia. Yaman is happy to see her again and together they settle in his modest home in Istanbul. They renew their torrid affair and are happy for sometime. But problems soon arise. One day an older woman arrives at the house with two children on her charge. She is Yaman's mother and they are his children. Only then, Desi finds out that he has previously been married and had children; there have been many women in Yaman's life, before her. When Desi goes to the Spanish embassy to inquire about her immigration status in Turkey, Paulina, a woman from the embassy, offers her advice and friendship. She later warns Desi about Yaman. Paulina knows about him and his reputation is not good. However, Desi strongly dismisses the unrequited advice. Desi wants to have another baby after the one she lost, but once pregnant, Yaman, despite her protest, made her have an abortion. The procedure does not go well and Desi ends up unable to have further children. When he is not working as a tourist guide, Yaman sells Turkish carpets at the bazaar in a family business with his brother. Both of them decide to force Desi to work for them. Besides selling carpets, she would have to provide sexual favors for customers and other carpet dealers. Astonished about this new revelations, Desi, with Paulina's help, flees to Spain. Back in her country, Desi's friend, Laura and her husband pick her up at the airport in Madrid and take her to a hotel, but she is adamant about the choices she has made and refuses further help from her friends. To try to see what it feels to be with another man, Desi has sex with Ivan, a man she has just met, but her failure to feel the same she feels with Yaman, makes her go back to him in Turkey. Yaman is angry with her because she left and beats her. She does not care, wanting only to be with him. Yaman accepts her once again, but their relationship turns even darker. Now, Desi willingly accepts to participate in Yaman's dirty dealings and even has a sexual relationship behind his back, but Yaman maintains his sexual domination over her. Desi helps Yaman to make amends with another carpet dealer he has tried to deceive. After she sexually pleases the voyeuristic old man, he gives her a small gun as a gift. Returning home that night, Desi finds Yaman having sex with a couple, Desi can not tolerate him having sex with another man. Unashamed, he drags them to a bar where a belly dancer is performing. During the dance, Yaman flirts with Desi and the other woman and Desi shoots him between the legs. Yaman falls to the floor badly hurt, but allows Desi to escape. He orders her to flee but never to return. Desi, carrying her bags, leaves Istanbul for good. A part of her has died there. Cast Originally, Victoria Abril, Vicente Aranda's favorite actress, was going to star in the film, but she was unavailable, having gone to Hollywood to make Barry Levinson's Jimmy Hollywood. The role of Desi was offered to Spanish singer and actress Ana Belén, who is better known internationally as a singer; La pasión turca is considered by many as her best movie role. Vicente Aranda remembers, \\"I was very happy, Anna seemed to me the right actress to play the role.\\" Belén and Aranda became good friends during filming and both remembered it fondly. They would work together again in Libertarias (1995). Georges Corraface plays the role of Yaman, the handsome Turkish tourist guide, whose sexual powers made Deisdera falls madly in love with him Corraface is a French- Greek actor who has had an international career in film, most notably in Escape from L.A. and Christopher Columbus. He was very happy working for the first time in Spanish. The story and the character of Yaman attracted him, a man he describes as sadly unable to love and hold that feeling. He gets bored and needs to twist this feeling in a perverted way to keep the relationship alive.La Pasión Turca, DVD. Interview in the Program la Gran Ilusión Ramón Madaula, a Catalan actor, plays Ramiro, Desi's husband. Sílvia Munt, who won the Goya Award as best actress for her role in Alas de mariposa (1991), took the role of Laura, Desi's friend. Loles León had the small role of a Spanish embassy employée; she had worked for Pedro Almodóvar in Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! and for Vicente Aranda in El amante bilingüe (1993) and Libertarias (1996). *Ana Belén as Desideria *Georges Corraface as Yaman *Ramón Madaula as Ramiro *Sílvia Munt as Laura *Helio Pedregal as Arturo *Blanca Apilánez as Felisa *Francis Lorenzo as Marcelo *Loles León as Paulina Production In 1994, Andrés Vicente Gómez, a Spanish film producer, had the idea to adapt to the big screen the popular novel La Pasión Turca, written by Antonio Gala. The year before, Gomez had produced Aranda's movie El Amante Bilingüe, a film adaptation of a novel written by Juan Marsé. El Amante Bilingüe (1993) had been a critical and commercial disappointment; nevertheless, the producer and director were eager to make another film together. Gómez thought that if he had made a mistake with the previous film adaptation, he now was sure Aranda was the right director to adapt La Pasión Turca into a film. Gomez had to convince Gala, who originally wanted Mario Camús to direct the film.Cánovás Belchí, Joaquín (ed.), Miradas Sobre el Cine de Vicente Aranda, Murcia: Universidad de Murcia, 2000, p. 71 Aranda explained his reason to make La Pasión Turca: 'After making two risky films of little commercial success: El Amante Bilingü and Intruso (1993), I wanted to make a film that would find an audience, and it was like that.' In the process of adapting the novel to a feature film, there were disagreements between Gala and Aranda; the latter remembers: 'When Gala read the script he said that it was like a tree without leaves. That did stick to my mind, because to think that a telegram has leaves is asking for too much, and a film script is like that.' Further disagreements aroused when Aranda changed the end of the story. In the novel, Desideria commits suicide, while in the film, she leaves Istanbul for an unspecified destination. Aranda explained: 'Gala understood that the story could only have ended in suicide. On the other hand, I am against suicide, I can't help it. I argued that what it seemed to me indispensable, as thesis of the film, was that passion can destroy but it cannot be denied, and my solution eventually prevailed.Vicente Aranda, 2006 Declaración de Intenciones www.vicentearanda.es. I filmed two different endings and after several screenings, the producer decided to leave the one I had proposed. When the time came to release the film on DVD, I had the idea to include both endings. Now La Pasión Turca is often transmitted on television, showing the alternative ending.' La Pasión Turca began filming on May 16, 1994. It was filmed in Turkey (Istanbul and Capadocia) and in Spain (Madrid, Ávila, and Sigüenza) with a budget of 360 million pesetas, and premiered in Spain on December 16, 1994. Aranda remembers production in Istanbul fondly: 'The shooting in Istanbul was very pleasant for all. We were in a good hotel, everything was very cheap and we used to go shopping to that wonderful place that is the Great Bazaar...we were accused of using stereotypes. What was Turkey for us? Basically, belly dancers. In fact, something similar happens in Spain when foreign directors come here to make films. Showing Barcelona, they present a mule carrying pitchers led by an old man in black. I began to reflect in the unavoidable convenience to used stereotypes as synthesis of element within the narrative.' The character of Desideria Oliván was based on a real woman even though Gala vehemently denied this.La Pasión Turca, DVD. Interview in the program La Gran Ilusión She was a woman from a well-off family from Lleida, married, and during a holiday in Turkey, fell in love with a local man, leaving everything for him. It was revealed to the film crew, during shooting in the Grand Bazaar, that the real Desideria had a store there, selling carpets. In front of the store, she had a Spanish flag and a sign reading 'Catalan is spoken here'. Aranda recalled that out of courtesy, he tried to inform her that a film, slightly based on her life, was being made, but she declined any contact with them. The story shown, both in the book and in the film, is of course very different from the real story, and the real Desidera enjoyed a happy life with the Turkish man she married. Themes The film is an erotic drama, an exploration of female sexual desire, a theme that Vicente Aranda explored again with La mirada del otro (1998) but not as successfully. The destructive power of uncontrollable passion and sexual desire also appeared as a theme in Aranda's films: Amantes (1991), Intruso (1993) and Celos (1999). La pasión turca and other films In essence, La pasión turca is similar to Aranda's later film La mirada del otro (1998). Both films focus on an independent-minded woman's search for sexual fulfillment, which borders on obsession. Like Laura Morante in the latter film, Ana Belén here delivers a committed central performance. La pasión turca slightly resembles Shirley Valentine (1989), a play adapted into a film, in which a middle-aged, working class, housewife's life is transformed after a holiday abroad. Reception The film had its premiere in December 1994. 1,200,000 tickets were sold in Spain alone and the film made 625 million pesetas at the box office. Producer Andrés Vicente Gómez recalled the success of the film: \\"I think Vicente Aranda made a great movie, with the limitation force upon him with a melodramatic novel. He resolved those problems brilliantly. The actors were great, the story was intriguing and Vicente Aranda took advantage of the location and all the resources he was provided with. La pasión turca was a great success and I was very pleased. All the money I have lost with El amante bilingüe, I made back with this film.\\" Among critics, La pasión turca has had its fair share of outspoken critics and admirers. The film was highly controversial not only for its many erotic scenes but for having the director change the end of the film from how it was in the original novel. Awards and nominations * Two Goya Awards: Best Music Score (Jose Nieto) and Best Production Supervision (Jose Luis Escolar) (1995) * ADIRCAE Award – Best Actress (Ana Belén) 1995 * Saint Jordi Awards – Best supporting Actress Silvya Munt (1995) * Fotogramas de Plata: Best Actress (Ana Belén) 1995 * Twelve nominations to the Goya Awards: Best Film, Director, Lead Actress, Supporting Actress, Score, Cinematography, Make up, Production Design, Sound, Adapted Screenplay, Costume Design and Production Supervision The film was also entered into the 19th Moscow International Film Festival. Home media La pasión turca was released on Region 2 in a double DVD set. The film appears on disc 1 while all of the extras are on disc 2. Aside from a theatrical trailer, a TV spot, a gallery of deleted scenes (in Spanish only), photo gallery, filmographies, and making of (in Spanish only), there is also an alternate ending (also in Spanish only) which reinstates the original ending by Aranda reflecting the manner in which the book La pasión turca is based upon ends.

It was formed in 1939 as 5th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery before being redesignated in 1958. It currently serves in the Surveillance and Target Acquisition role and is equipped with radars and acoustic sound ranging equipment; it also provides Special Observation Post teams. British M107 Special Observer Badge, worn by Soldiers who have passed STA Patrol Training History =Formation and Second World War= The regiment was formed as 5th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery on 25 November 1939 at Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire and consisted of K Battery (the Riding Troop at St John's Wood) and G Battery (Mercers Troop) (from 4th RHA). CC Battery was formed for the regiment in December 1940. In 1940, the regiment formed part of the British Expeditionary Force in France. After being evacuated at Dunkirk it joined Home Forces in the United Kingdom before being assigned to the 8th Support Group, 8th Armoured Division. On 8 May 1942, it departed the United Kingdom to take part in the North African Campaign. It arrived in Egypt on 18 Julythe long sea journey being due to transiting via the Cape of Good Hope. 8th Armoured Division never operated as a complete formation and the regiment served with 23rd Armoured Brigade Group (Defence of the El Alamein Line and the Battle of Alam el Halfa) and 24th Armoured Brigade Group (Battle of El Alamein). On 1 December 1942, it joined 7th Armoured Division and remained with it for the rest of the war. It took part in the rest of the Western Desert Campaign, the Tunisian Campaign and, briefly, the Italian Campaign (9 September15 October 1943). It returned to the United Kingdom in January 1944 to prepare for the invasion of Europe. It fought in the North-West Europe Campaign from 8 July 1944 through to the end of the war. =Reorganisation= Because of the reorganisation of the Royal Horse Artillery in 1958, the regiment became the 5th Field Regiment RA. On 1 February 1958, C Battery moved to 3rd RHA and G Battery (Mercer's Troop) moved to 4th RHA. P Battery (The Dragon Troop) left 4th RHA and Q (Sanna's Post) Battery moved from 10th Field Artillery Regiment on 5 February 1958 to join K Battery and form the regiment. After a short period near Crickhowell, the regiment left the UK in September 1958 for a three-year tour of Hong Kong. After a tour equipped with 25 lb guns, the regiment returned to Salisbury Plain in Southern England in October 1961 as 5 Light Regiment RA. =The Sixties= During its stay at Perham Down, the regiment had many equipment changes. In 1961, K Battery had 5.5\\" guns, while P and Q Batteries were equipped with 25 pounders; then, in 1962, all batteries were allotted 4.2\\" mortars as well as other guns. In 1963, the regiment converted to 105mm Pack Howitzers and took part in exercises in Libya, Canada and Norway with this versatile new gun. In August/September 1964, the regiment moved to the British Army of the Rhine in Germany, reverted to its title of 5th Field Regiment RA, and was stationed in Gutersloh as a Close Support Regiment. Once again K Battery had 5.5\\" guns and P and Q Batteries 25 pounders, but these later gave way to the Abbot Self Propelled (SP) gun in 1966. The regiment returned to Southern England in 1969, this time to Bulford. =The Seventies= The next three years at Bulford were dominated by four emergency tours of Northern Ireland. The regiment was mostly operating in the Londonderry area and had three fatalities from terrorist actions. At this time, the regiment was equipped with the 105mm pack howitzer (towed by Land Rover) and served in the light airborne role. In 1972, the regiment moved to Hildesheim, Germany and re-equipped with M107 SP 175mm Guns and again changed its name to 5th Heavy Regiment RA. 18 Battery joined the regiment in February 1977 following the disbandment of 42 Regiment RA. =The Eighties= After 12 years at Tofrek Barracks in Hildesheim, the regiment moved to West Riding Barracks in Dortmund in 1984. 18 (Quebec 1759) Battery and Q (Sanna's Post) Battery (which was renamed as 74 Battery (the Battle-Axe Company)) left the regiment to join 32 Heavy Regiment RA. 73 (Sphinx) Locating Battery moved from 94 Locating Regiment to 5th Regiment in January 1985 and was renamed Q (Sanna's Post) Battery. During this period, the Gun Batteries both carried out operational tours of Northern Ireland. =The Nineties= After Operation Granby, the regiment converted from the M107 SP Gun to the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). On 1 April 1993, 73 (Sphinx) OP Battery became 4/73 (Sphinx) Special OP Battery. In late 1993, the regiment carried out a Regimental Arms Plot from Dortmund to Catterick in North Yorkshire. After nearly nine months of unsettled transit period working in Towthorpe Lines, Strensall, near York, the regiment moved into the former RAF Catterick Barracks, now renamed Marne Barracks. In October 1994, the regiment redeployed to Northern Ireland; this time to South Armagh as the Drumadd Roulement Battalion (DRB). On 10 June 1997, the regiment, less 4/73 Battery, deployed to Cyprus on Operation TOSCA. =Recent= Both K Battery and 4/73 Battery were involved in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and 1 Battery was deployed to Afghanistan for Operation Herrick 4. In 2009 the regiment became a Surveillance and Target Acquisition (STA) Regiment and re-equipped with radar equipment. According to a written answer, 5 RA will utilise the Bulldog armoured vehicle instead of the Warthog vehicle on operations. Current sub- units The batteries are as follows: *53 (Louisburg) Battery RA formed in 1740. Air Assault STA. *K (Hondeghem) Battery RA formed in 1809.

Located in the heart of Seminole County along the middle basin of the St. Johns, the lake encompasses an area of approximately 16,000 acres (65 km²), including open water and floodplain. It is named in honor of Brigadier General Thomas Jesup, an American military officer who served in the Second Seminole War. The lake boasts one of the longest free- standing bridges, part of the Seminole Expressway, which bisects the lake. The lake is home to a wide variety of species and is considered to support one of the state's densest populations of alligators. Drivers on the bridge across the lake are likely to see eagles (osprey and bald eagles) perched on the light posts watching for fish. During the 1960s, the toll of decades of abuse and neglect was very apparent. Wastewater discharged directly into the lake, stormwater discharges from surrounding communities, the construction of berms that segregated the lake from parts of its floodplain, and a causeway that reduced the lake's connection with the St. Johns River all took their toll on the ecosystem. The discharges resulted in significant algal growth, fish kills, and a thick layer of muck more than 9½ feet deep in some areas sitting on the bottom of the lake that now averages only six feet in depth. The berm construction aggravated this problem by limiting the lake's ability to cleanse itself. During the 1990s studies were conducted of water circulation patterns, storm-water runoff into the lake, the impacts of the State Road 46 bridge, sediments within the lake, and land management plans for adjacent public properties. With this data in hand, The Friends of Lake Jesup and the St. Johns River Water Management District staff worked closely with the Florida Department of Transportation and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to develop a plan for restoring the lake. The Friends and the District staff, working closely with the Florida Department of Transportation and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, began to determine the most environmentally sound and economically feasible methods of restoring the lake. Since that time the water district brought about around the lake into public ownership and has plans for acquiring an additional of floodplain around the lake as part of the restoration process and to ensure the health of the lake into the future. In the spring of 1996 a berm on the north side of the lake was removed, reuniting of floodplain with the lake to act as a natural filter. The removal of this berm also increases the lake's flood buffering capacity as well as provides habitat to a wide variety of life. In January 2008 the Army Corps of Engineers, the Florida Department of Transportation, and others contracted to have the State Road 46 bridge rebuilt. The re-opening of channel B and the removal of about a mile of causeway was designed to improve the flow of the St. Johns River into and out of the lake. Several other projects were also undertaken to improve the quality of the lake. The Friends of Lake Jesup was active in monitoring these projects and in bringing new areas of concern into focus. There are small businesses that operate lakeside restaurants, fish camps, and airboat tours in the vicinity of the lake.

History  14 Regiment Royal Artillery was formed in Woolwich in March 1900, with roots traced through the history of 28th Field Brigade, which saw action in virtually every major battle on the Western Front during the four years of World War I, and during World War II as part of the East Africa campaign. Of note, the regiment was heavily involved with 25 pounder guns in the successful Battle of Keren in Spring 1941. Renamed '14th Field Regiment Royal Artillery' in 1947, it has also served in India, Hong Kong, Korea, Aden and later in Northern Ireland. Following disbandment in 1971, 14th Field Regiment Royal Artillery was reformed at Larkhill in December 1984 as the Training Support Regiment for the Royal School of Artillery.

It serves in the field artillery role with 16 Air Assault Brigade, and is equipped with the L118 Light Gun. The regiment was constituted in 1961 out of existing batteries that have served continuously since the Napoleonic Wars.  History  The regiment was formed on 27 June 1961 with the re-designation of 33rd Parachute Light Regiment Royal Artillery as 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. The regiment first saw action in the middle-east in Kuwait in 1961 and then in Aden in 1963–65 where it was involved in fierce fighting in the Radfan mountains. The 1970s and 80’s saw the regiment involved in four Northern Ireland tours in the infantry role as well as a period where they briefly lost their airborne status and were arms-plotted to Germany until 1984 when they joined newly formed 5th Airborne Brigade and returned to Aldershot. In 1994 the regiment deployed to Cyprus as part of the UN mission to patrol the buffer-zone between Cypriot and Turkish forces. This was followed in 1996–97 with two battery deployments to Bosnia as part of the NATO mission and the Kosovo campaign of 1999. Since the formation of 16 Air Assault Brigade in 1999, 7 Para RHA has been involved in numerous overseas operations. The Sierra Leone campaign in summer 2000 was followed by Op Essential Harvest in Macedonia a year later. The regiment also sent a number of troops to Northern Ireland in 2001 who were at the forefront of the Holy Cross riots in that year while deployed with the 1st Battalion the Royal Irish Regiment. Two batteries deployed to the Kabul area of Afghanistan in early 2002. On the afternoon of 19 March 2003 7 RHA fired the first shots of the Iraq War by any coalition ground forces. The next day they crossed the border in support of the US I Marine Expeditionary Force. The regiment was instrumental in securing the strategic Rumalya oilfields and supporting the MEF in their move north to Nasiriyah.Lowry, p. 309U.S. Marines in Iraq, 2003, History and Museums Division, United States Marine Corps, 2006, anthology, page 109Marine Artillery in the Battle of An Nasiriyah, Field Artillery November–December 2003, Major Walker M.

The first of these saw the regiment play a key role in the break into Helmand province. This tour attracted much public attention and has often been described as the most intense combat fighting since the Korean War of the 1950s. The regiment returned to Helmand two years later and were again involved in heavy fighting – cumulating in the large scale operation to move a turbine from Kandahar along a heavily mined and fiercely defended road to the Kajaki Dam. 7 RHA's final deployment to Afghanistan saw the regiment's gun groups and Fire Support Teams deploy to central Helmand Province in order to provide offensive support to 16th Air Assault Brigade.

New Orleans, Louisiana has many historic ties to Haiti that date back to the Haitian Revolution. New York City, especially in Flatbush, East Flatbush and Springfield Gardens, has a thriving émigré community with the second largest population of Haitians of any state in the nation. There are large and active Haitian communities in Boston; Spring Valley (New York); New Jersey; Washington D.C.; Providence, Rhode Island; Georgia; Connecticut and Pennsylvania. There are also large Haitian communities in Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Paris, France; Havana, Cuba; San Juan, Puerto Rico and Kingston, Jamaica. Anténor Firmin was a 19th-century Haitian anthropologist, perhaps the first black anthropologist and an early writer of négritude, who influenced 20th century American anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits. Michaëlle Jean, the former Governor General of Canada and now Secretary-General of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, was a refugee from Haiti who came to Canada in 1968 at age 11. Haitian immigrants have constituted a very visible segment of American and Canadian society, dating back to before the independence of Haiti from France in 1804. Haiti's proximity to the United States, and its status as a free black republic in the years before the American Civil War, have contributed to this relationship. Many influential early American settlers and black freemen, including Jean Baptiste Point du Sable and W. E. B. Du Bois, were of Haitian origin. In modern times, large- scale emigration from Haiti is mostly because they have been steadily migrating in significant numbers to the United States since the late 1950s–early 1960s, soon after François Duvalier (\\"Papa Doc\\") became the strongman of Haiti. The political repression that characterized Duvalier's regime forced large numbers of Haitians to seek safer harbor in the United States. Sustained political oppression, economic hardship, and lack of opportunity continued to drive contingents of Haitian immigrants out of their homeland throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990sZéphir 1996, 2001; Catanese 1999. =Present status in the United States= Haitian immigration persists to the present day, as evidenced in the numerous reports of major news networks, such as those of CNN or the New York Times, about the boat people disembarking on the Florida shores as recently as October 2002. The combination of push and pull factors led Haitians to cross the Caribbean Sea, by plane or by boat, legally or illegally, in order to reach the shores of America, the perceived land of opportunity, to begin new lives. An examination of the records of the Census Bureau as well as those of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) allows for reasonable inferences about the size of the legal Haitian population currently residing in the United States. However, estimates provided by community leaders who offer assistance to the illegal population as well suggest that the actual number of the Haitian diaspora is higher than that recorded in government documents. In short, there is good reason to believe that the Haitian diaspora in the United States exceeds 850,000, and according to community leaders may be close to 1 million. That the Haitian community in the U.S. is one of the fastest-growing ethnic groups is reflected in its political gains. Florida boasts two Haitian- American state lawmakers, and another recently served as secretary of health under former Gov. Jeb Bush, who actively courted the community's votes. In Chicago, Kwame Raoul, the son of Haitian émigrés, now fills Sen. Barack Obama's former state Senate seat. Pierre-Richard Prosper, the son of Haitian doctors, served as U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes after he was nominated by President Bush in January 2001. He ended his term in 2005. Under heavy lobbying by the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus and some Republicans, Congress enacted the HOPE Act, and President Bush signed it. The act provides duty-free imports for some Haitian textiles. The Bush administration also spared Haiti some of the deep aid cuts that hit other Latin American nations. The Congressional Black Caucus has urged more economic aid for Haiti and criticized the lack of U.S. support for former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted in 2004 amid a violent uprising.Sawyer, J. (2004, March 7). Island offers a lesson for U.S. St. Louis Post-Dispatch, p. B1. Retrieved from http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/Belfast News Letter. (2004, March 1). Aristide flees as rebels close on Haitian capital. Belfast News Letter, p. 16. Retrieved from http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/ =New York City= New York City has the largest concentration of Haitians in the United States as well as the oldest established Haitian communities of the country. The conservative estimate of the documented Haitian population in the New York City Metropolitan Area, as recorded by INS is approximately 156,000. However, community leaders and directors of community centers, who come in constant contact with the undocumented population, strongly believe that the actual number is closer to 400,000. This number includes the non-immigrant (temporary visitors, students, temporary workers and trainees) and undocumented entrants, as well as the documented residents who do not fill out the census forms for a variety of reasons. Moreover, the New York City Haitian population represents a very heterogeneous group, reflecting the various strata of Haitian society. Members of the middle class started migrating during the U.S. occupation in the 1920s and 1930s; at the time they established their enclaves in Harlem, where they mingled with African Americans and other Caribbean immigrants who were contributing to the Harlem Renaissance. Significant waves followed exponentially during the Duvalier era that started in 1957 and ended in 1986 with the ousting of Baby Doc. These waves were more heterogeneous than previous ones, as no single class of Haitians was immune from the Duvaliers’ dictatorship. To date, cohorts of Haitians continue to come to New York, many being sent for by relatives already established in the city. Haitians reside in all the boroughs. Brooklyn The largest communities are found in Brooklyn where the legal population is placed at approximately 88,763, and in Queens where the number of Haitians is believed to be around 40,000. Members of the community who are of working-class background tend to establish their residence in Brooklyn, primarily in the neighborhoods of Flatbush, Crown Heights, East Flatbush, and Canarsie; many are apartment dwellers many homes in the area are duplexes and triplexes. Upper middle-class Haitians who choose to stay in Brooklyn own brownstone homes in the Park Slope area and single family homes in the Midwood section. Queens Generally speaking, Haitians themselves consider the majority of their compatriots living in Queens to be mostly middle class. Members of this group enjoy ownership of their homes or cooperative apartments in the neighborhoods of Cambria Heights, Queens Village, Springfield Gardens, and Jamaica. Less privileged Haitians settle in the working-class neighborhoods of Rosedale; generally members of the professional community live in the more affluent section of Holliswood, and some move to the adjacent counties of Nassau and Suffolk which are parts of Long Island. Manhattan In Manhattan, a small concentration of working-class Haitians (7%) congregates on the Upper West Side and Harlem. Some reside along Cathedral Parkway and in Washington Heights. Very few Haitians (less than 1%) establish their niches in the Bronx. Metropolitan area In this discussion, it is also important to recall that Haitians have established communities in the neighboring counties of Westchester and Rockland that are included in the Greater New York Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as in the city of Bridgeport, Connecticut. In fact, Spring Valley in Rockland County has a relatively large segment of Haitian residents, estimated at 23% of the population. In Westchester County the city of Mt. Vernon has a small but significant Haitian community. Visibility The number of Haitians in New York makes them a highly visible community. In neighborhoods with higher concentration of Haitians the community has managed to establish institutions and businesses such as community centers, churches, music shops, grocery stores, restaurants, bakeries, bars, beauty and barber shops, travel agencies, shipping companies, money transfer companies, and a hodgepodge of other enterprises. Those are found all along Flatbush, Church, and Nostrand Avenues, as well as along Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn; on Linden, Farmers and Francis Lewis Boulevards, and Jamaica and Hillside Avenues in Queens. They are easily recognizable since many display signs written both in English and Haitian Creole (sometimes in French), such as Yoyo Fritaille, Le Manoir, Le Viconte, Haiti Parcel & Cargo Inc., and Bakery Creole. On intensely hot days, passersby strolling along these avenues and boulevards have their nostrils filled with the aromas of fried meats and plantains, and their ears with rhythms of Sweet Micky, Kompa, Zin, T-Vice, CaRiMi, Tabou Combo, and Boukman Eksperyans, to name some of the most celebrated musical groups and bands. Animated conversations in Haitian Creole can be heard, as members of the community \\"hang out\\" in those shops and businesses to discuss home politics and news, exchange gossip, find out what goes on in the community, and keep alive their various traditions, be they culinary, intellectual, literary, or artistic. During the summer, some musicians perform a parading musical form called Rara in Central Park and Prospect Park. Culturally relevant teaching According to the 2014–2015 English Language Learner Demographic Report published by the NYC Department of Education, 3,031 English Language Learners (ELLs) in K–12 schools in New York City speak Haitian Creole, making it the sixth most common home language of ELLs citywide and the fifth most common home language of Brooklyn ELLs. Because of the large population of Haitian Creole-speaking students within NYC schools, various organizations have been established to respond to the needs of these students. For example, Flanbwayan and Gran Chimen Sant Kiltirèl, both located in Brooklyn, New York, aim to promote education and Haitian culture through advocacy, literacy projects, and cultural/artistic endeavors. Other educators have called for a culturally relevant pedagogy to better meet the needs of Haitian Creole-speaking ELLs. For instance, noting the intrinsic value of cultural background knowledge on reading comprehension, Kristen L. Oscarsson employed Haitian folktales with a group of 4th and 5th grade Haitian students in the U.S. as a method of improving their literacy rates. At the end of her 12-week study, most of her students' reading skills had increased at least one grade level, with some increasing two or two and a half grade levels.Oscarsson, Kristen L. Haitian Folktales as a Literacy Strategy for Elementary Haitian ESOL Students. Master of Science Thesis, Nova University, 1992. =Miami= The documented Haitian- American population of Miami-Dade County, Florida, based on government records, is approximately 100,000. However, when one factors in the attested underrepresentation of the Census data, as well as the number of undocumented immigrants, there is good reason to believe that community leaders and technocrats who work with the Haitian community are not wrong to place Haitian population at over 200,000. A large contingent of Haitians may be living in Miami undocumented. Haitian people seeking political asylum and/or economic opportunity have been steadily arriving in Florida shores since the early 1970s. Little Haiti Haitians have established themselves in the Edison/Little River area of Miami, which eventually came to be referred to as Little Haiti. Once they are able, some end up moving out of Little Haiti to the neighboring municipality of North Miami where a relatively large segment of Haitian immigrants of lower-middle-class background relocates. On the other hand, Miami is also experiencing another wave of Haitian immigration, this time coming from the Northeast United States (New York City and Boston), the Midwest (Chicago), and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. This particular group of Haitians is composed mostly of middle-class individuals who relocate to Florida due to the weather and its proximity to Haiti. These newer residents often live in the middle-class neighborhoods such as Miami Shores, North Miami Beach, El Portal, and Miami Gardens. Irrespective of the presence of middle- class Haitians, Miami is considered the city that received (and continues to receive) the largest segment of lower-class Haitians, consisting of poor peasants from andeyò (countryside) and urban dwellers. Many of these Haitians found new lives in the Edison/Little River section of Miami, one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city. Soon after, this area became known as Little Haiti, and is now one of the most recognizable Haitian communities in the United States. From north to south, Little Haiti extends from 84th Street to 36th Street; from west to east, it is ten blocks wide, stretching from 6th Ave, NW to 4th Ave, NE. It is crossed by two major north-south axes: Miami Avenue, and Second Avenue NE renamed Avenue Morrisseau-Leroy after the revered Haitian writer who championed the cause of (Haitian) Creole in literature, and who spent the later years of his life in Miami until his death in the late summer of 1998. The main thoroughfares that cross east/west are 36th, 54th, 62nd, and 79th Streets. Estimates of the population of Little Haiti vary from 40,000 to 55,000. Little Haiti is also considered one of the poorest areas of Miami-Dade County. The following figures were released by the Edison/Little River Neighborhood Planning Program (1994–96): The per capita income is $5,693, the median household income is $14,142, and close to half the population lives below poverty level. City government efforts are currently underway to revitalize the neighborhood, by creating long-term economic development, and improving housing and infrastructure. The City of Miami has established in Little Haiti a neighborhood service center (along with others throughout the metropolitan area), known as Neighborhood Enhancement Teams (NET) to address the social problems of the community. Delray Beach Delray Beach, Florida, has become the US town with the largest percentage Haitian population in the United States. More than just sheer numbers, the Haitian community also grew geographically, economically, and socially; extending itself while maintaining a relatively low profile in the community it has adopted as its own. This growth has paralleled the incredible economic turnaround of Delray Beach as a municipality. It represents the awakening of a community which for a long time has lived in the shadow of its larger neighbor in Miami. The impressive growth has also brought about some strains within the Haitian community and in the community's interactions with the other residents of Delray Beach. Ethnic visibility Most of the Haitian businesses in Little Haiti are found along the major arterials mentioned above; like those of New York, they are unmistakably Haitian with names such as Bèl Fouchèt, Piman Bouk, Les Cousins, Libreri Mapou, and Cayard Market. They include restaurants, grocery stores, dry cleaning establishments, tailor and shoe repair shops, shipping and money transfer companies, botanicas (shops that sell mostly religious/spiritual objects, including Vodou artifacts), among others. Little Haiti is the heart of the Haitian community of Miami. =Boston= Boston has attracted significant numbers of immigrants from Haiti for over 40 years. This arrival over time of Haitians in Boston corresponded to several waves of migration that have come to the United States from the Caribbean country since the 1950s. The largest of these migratory waves in the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s flowed into the metropolitan New York area. Since the late 1970s, the largest destination has expanded to include South Florida. Haitians have settled in sections within the Boston city limits and its surrounding area. The location and diffusion of the population has mirrored the growth of the community. Highly concentrated in the city at first, Boston's Haitians slowly expanded to neighboring municipalities and, most recently, to far-flung suburbs. There are, for example, significant numbers of the population in Brockton, Randolph, and Malden. The area of greatest Haitian concentration in Boston proper is in Mattapan, followed by Dorchester, Hyde Park and Roxbury. Blue Hill Avenue is an important Haitian thoroughfare. The street runs through Roxbury and Dorchester. Its last section, in Mattapan, is Boston's Haitian ‘downtown.’ There, the street is dotted with several Haitian businesses. Many Haitian churches and organizations have their headquarters along Blue Hill Avenue also. On the north bank of the Charles River, Haitians settled in Cambridge in the 1950s and 60s. The population in this area now numbers approximately 7,500. Although Haitians did not arrive in nearby Somerville until the early 1990s, the community there today is almost as large as the one in Cambridge. Currently, however, increasing costs of living in Cambridge and Somerville are beginning to drive out people of modest means. The result has been the relocation of many of these area's Haitians to the more affordable neighboring towns of Revere, Everett, and Lynn. Ethnic visibility In the mind of most Americans, Boston is a city of politics, and politics in Boston is dominated by its Irish population, particularly the legendary Kennedy family. In today's city, however, where the traditionally powerful white population has recently become a minority, another immigrant group — Haitians — has found itself in a position to play an important role in building institutions, starting enterprises and building broad political coalitions with other groups. The strong organizational basis of the community is evident from the broad array of public and private entities that serve it. To those who have followed the community's evolution, it unsurprising that Haitians in Boston are beginning to develop themselves into an emerging, local political force. A variety of entrepreneurial activities established in the Haitian population have been highly successful in the Boston area. Activities focusing on food services (catering and restaurants), money transfer, tax preparation, and financial management are among the most common, attracting interest and sustaining success. These enterprises cater to the needs of any recently arrived and rapidly growing population. Haitian entrepreneurs have established businesses through the Boston metro region. Mattapan to Dorchester, on both sides of Blue Hill Avenue, they are in greatest profusion. Many of the area's earliest immigrants from Haiti were skilled professionals who went on to become locally prominent lawyers, doctors, and educators. In increasing numbers, Haitian immigrants are working in the region's health care system, particularly as nurses. One community leader suggests that a visit to any nursing home in the Boston area would uncover the fact that 75% of those working there are Haitian. Other common areas of employment include office positions with the high-tech companies along Route 128, as well as positions as teachers in elementary and high schools. The Haitian community in Boston, now almost 50 years old, has adjusted to several waves of immigration, each bringing people with different socio-economic backgrounds, interests, and needs. Members of today's community include a variety of generations and individuals that have had radically different life experiences, ranging from a 70-year-old man who arrived in the late 1950s to a 10-year-old, third generation child who has never been to Haiti. Finding the common ground among such diverse members of the population is one issue in the community as is another one, dictated at least in part by geography. As Haitians spread throughout the metropolitan area, they are becoming somewhat economically segmented, with the blue-collar, lower-middle-class population in places like Mattapan or Somerville confronting quite different issues and challenges than the more white-collar, upper-middle-class families in places like Randolph on the outer fringes of the metropolitan area. =New Jersey= New Jersey is also home to the fourth largest population of Haitians in the United States after Florida, New York and the Boston area. There are several areas of New Jersey which the communities of Haitians live. The largest is in North Jersey where the population is visible around the Essex County cities of Irvington, Orange, East Orange, Newark concentrated in the area of Vailsburg. Other areas of North Jersey where a Haitian presence is visible are in Elizabeth, Bayonne, and Jersey City. There is also a growing population in the suburbs of Essex and Union County in West Orange, Maplewood, Roselle and Union. Other growing populations of the Haitian community can be seen in Central and South Jersey specifically in Asbury Park, Trenton, Willingboro and the Pleasantville/Atlantic City area. Ethnic visibility The visibility of Haitians living in New Jersey especially in North Jersey can be seen in the different businesses such as music shops, grocery stores, restaurants, bakeries, bars, beauty and barber shops, travel agencies, tax companies, shipping companies, money transfer companies, and a hodgepodge of other businesses, which display their allegiances to their native country. Those are found all along Main Street and Central Avenue in Orange and East Orange, along Springfield, Stuyvesant and Clinton Avenues in Irvington and along South Orange Avenue in Newark and East Orange. Haitian-American youth are especially visible at collegiate institutions, such as Rutgers University, Kean University and Montclair State University where a very active Haitian student organization is present on campus. =Philadelphia= Next to the NYC/New Jersey/Connecticut/Massachusetts area, Philadelphia has also become home to a growing number of Haitians. Like many other groups, the lower cost of living in Philadelphia has attracted many immigrants who entered the US through New York. There are large numbers of Haitians in North Philadelphia, Northeast, and some in other areas like Olney, East Mount Airy, Chestnut Hill, and West Philadelphia. The conservative number of Haitians in Philadelphia is 30,000. =Chicago= Illinois’ Haitian population of about 15,000 is much smaller than that of Haitian communities on the East Coast. Illinois’ Haitian community is widely dispersed, with small enclaves of Haitian professionals, middle and working-class people and poor, undocumented refugees scattered in small clusters in and around Chicago. There is no 'Little Haiti' neighborhood in Chicago, like in Miami, to act as a voting block. There are two elected Haitian-American official in the Chicago area, an alderman in Evanston, a suburb that straddles the city's north side where many Haitian immigrants have settled and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul. Lionel Jean-Baptiste, an attorney in private practice, was elected alderman in Evanston on April 3, 2001 becoming the first Haitian-American in the state to hold public office. Of the 8,000 residents in his ward, only about a hundred are Haitian and only about 30 of them registered voters, but that hasn't stopped Haitians throughout the region from claiming him as their own. Eighty percent of the financing for his campaign came from Haitian donors. Still, the community has had difficulty asserting itself. =Atlanta= Presently, there is already a sizable Haitian community in Atlanta. And it is, indeed, growing at a rapid pace. Unlike most other Haitian-American centers, though, Atlanta does not have a central neighborhood where it is located. The community, like the city, is spread out considerably over a large area. To a certain extent this diffusion of the Haitian population has been a hindrance to the community's ability to organize itself. At this moment, however, the tide seems to be turning, as a number of issues are galvanizing the community and bringing it closer together. Changes in the migration flows of Haitians to Atlanta, awareness of national-scale Haitian-American issues and the bicentennial of Haiti's independence in 2004, were all factors contributing toward the solidification of Atlanta's spread out Haitian population. Ethnic visibility The Haitian community is spread out over the large, greater metropolitan area of Atlanta. Because there is no single area within the metropolitan vastness where Haitians have settled, there is no specific Haitian commercial area. Haitians live, work and shop throughout the greater Atlanta area which now includes the surrounding Gwinnett, Cobb, Douglas, Dekalb, and Clayton counties. Within those counties, they live, work, and shop in such towns as Lawrenceville, Smyrna, Marietta, Decatur, Stone Mountain and Austell. One of the areas of Haitian businesses within this great urban sprawl is on Moreland Avenue in Atlanta proper, where two Haitian-owned businesses face each other in a small shopping center. A number of Haitian businesses are located in Marietta, but not within a close range of each other. In addition, many new Haitians from the Northeast and Florida are relocating to the middle- class area of Gwinnett County in Lawrenceville. This area has established itself as the center of Haitian economic development in the Atlanta metropolitan area with a family friendly culture and atmosphere with great schools, parks, and shops. =Detroit= Haitians in the Detroit area are not located in any single neighborhood or part of the city. The greatest concentration of Haitian families, however, is in Northwest Detroit, within an area bounded by Telegraph Road, the Southfield Freeway, 5 Mile Road and 8 Mile Road. Located within this general area is St. Gerard's, one of two Roman Catholic churches attended by Detroit's Haitians. Sacred Heart, the other, is located closer to downtown Detroit. Also not far from downtown, on Ferry Street in Detroit's museum district near Wayne State University, is another key institution of the Haitian community, the Espoir Center for Caribbean Arts and Culture. =Washington, D.C.= Haitians in the metropolitan Washington area are found in the city and in outlying areas in Virginia and Maryland. Although Washington's Haitians are scattered within the region, the single location with the heaviest concentration of Haitian-Americans is the suburban area of Silver Spring, Langley Park and Hyattsville, Maryland, home of the future ISU president Sebi. As evidence of this fact, not only are such Haitian institutions as Yon-Yon's catering business, but also one can occasional hear spoken Creole in shops and stores in this part of Montgomery County and in nearby Prince George's County. =Canada= In the 1950s, the Haitian population in Canada only numbered in the forties. The emigration of Haitians in more substantial numbers began with the bloody dictatorship of Francois Duvalier in the early 1960s. With most Haitians being able to speak French, Canada is a natural destination as French is one Canada's two official languages alongside English. The Haitian diaspora, including all emigrants and their immediate descendants, is estimated to number close to 165,000. Many chose Canada as their new home, specifically Quebec, for linguistic and religious reasons. In coming to Canada, professional Haitians often had to bypass a Duvalier law forbidding them to leave Haiti. They frequently were forced to flee Haiti with false documents and with no legal proof of identity. Upon arrival in Canada they would declare their status as political refugees. The trend of French-speaking Haitian immigrants to Canada was to settle in Quebec. By 1965, some 2,000 Haitians had arrived. The period covering the late 1960 through the 1970s saw a dramatic change in both the volume and background of Haitian immigrants. This was the beginning of the massive exodus in response to the Duvalier regime. Haitians were drawn to Canada because of its tolerant immigration laws – foreign visitors, arriving with only a tourist visas, could later apply for landed immigrant status while in Canada. Canada also held an Eden-like quality for the Haitians, an image painted by friends already in Quebec who sent reports home that employment was abundant and well- paid. From 1973 to 1976 an average of approximately 3,000 Haitians were admitted to Canada each year, with a peak of 4,750 in 1974. The settlement of Haitians in Canada by the end of the exodus was estimated to have reached 45,070, according to Citizenship and Immigration Canada. Michaëlle Jean, the former Governor General of Canada, is a Haitian immigrant who came to Canada with her family at the age of 11. Montreal Immigration from Haiti to Quebec started in 1963. Haitian settlement in Montreal increased about 40% between the late 1960s and the early 1970s, rising from 55.1% in 1968 to 92.9% in 1973. The early Haitian immigrants, those who came between 1960 and 1970, were usually from the Haitian elite. They came from a comfortable life in terms of their social and professional status. Most were doctors, academics, teachers and pursued careers in the liberal professions. The increase in settlement within Montreal coincided with an increase in the number of high school educated immigrants; the percentage of immigrants that finished the eleventh grade of high school increased alongside the growth of Haitian transplants in Montreal. People of Haitian descent are estimated to number close to 100,000 in the Greater Montreal area. Ottawa There are an estimated +20,000 persons of Haitian descent in the National Capital Region (including Ottawa and Gatineau). This community of Haitian-Canadians tends to be more bilingual. There was a Haitian-Canadian city councillor in Gatineau, QC: Mireille Apollon. She retired in 2018 after being elected twice. There is an annual Haitian music and culture festival, called Festival Haïti en fête, in the East-Ottawa suburb of Orléans, where a significant number of Haitian- Canadian families live. Cuba Haitian Creole and culture first entered Cuba with the arrival of Haitian immigrants at the start of the 19th century. Haiti was a French colony, and the final years of the 1791–1804 Haitian Revolution brought a wave of French settlers and their Haitian slaves to Cuba. They came mainly to the east, and especially Guantanamo, where the French later introduced sugar cultivation, constructed sugar refineries and developed coffee plantations. By 1804, some 30,000 French were living in Baracoa and Maisí, the furthest eastern municipalities of the province. Later, Haitians continued to come to Cuba to work as braceros (hand workers, from the Spanish word brazo, meaning \\"arm\\") in the fields cutting cane. Their living and working conditions were not much better than slavery. Although they planned to return to Haiti, most stayed on in Cuba. For years, many Haitians and their descendants in Cuba did not identify themselves as such or speak Creole. In the eastern part of the island, many Haitians suffered discrimination. But according to the Castro regime, since 1959, when he took over, this discrimination has stopped.\\"Haiti in Cuba\\", AfroCubanWeb Haitian Creole is the second most spoken language in Cuba, where over 300,000 Haitian immigrants speak it. It is recognized as a language in Cuba and a considerable number of Cubans speak it fluently. Most of these speakers have never been to Haiti and do not possess Haitian ancestry, but merely learned it in their communities. In addition to the eastern provinces, there are also communities in Ciego de Ávila and Camagüey provinces where the population still maintains Creole, their mother tongue. Classes in Creole are offered in Guantanamo, Matanzas and the City of Havana. In addition, there is a Haitian Creole radio station operating in Havana.Haiti in Cuba Brazil The year 2010 marked the beginning of Haitian immigration in Brazil. The arrival of the Haitians via Tabatinga, in the Amazon, began to be noticed in February 2010, soon after the earthquake, that shook violently Haiti, and in particular the capital, Port- au-Prince. The catastrophe has killed more than 150,000 people and left some 300,000 IDPs. The presence of Haitians in Brazil was quantitatively inexpressive until then. According to IBGE data, in 1940, 16 Haitians lived in Brazil; in 1950-21; in 1960-159; in 1970-90; in 1980-127; in 1991-1981; in 2000-15; and in 2010 - 36 people. With the presence in Haiti of the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of Haiti - MINUSTAH, led by Brazil since 2004, Haitians have come to see Brazil as a point of reference. After the earthquake of 2010, which triggered a great wave of emigration in Haiti, Brazil became one of the preferential destinations of migrants, given the difficulty of entry into countries of traditional emigration (United States, Canada, Dominican Republic, France, etc.). Currently, around 50 to 100 Haitians enter the country undocumented by the state of Acre. In 2015 and 2016, due to the political-economic crisis faced by Brazil, many Haitians are returning to Haiti, or going to other countries, such as Chile, Peru and the United States. According to the government of Acre, since December 2010, about 130,000 Haitians have entered the Peruvian border with the state. According to the delegate Carlos Frederico Portella Santos Ribeiro, of the Federal Police (PF), between January and September 2011, there were 6 thousand and, in 2012, 2,318 Haitians who entered without documents in Brazil. Haitians arrive in Brasiléia, Acre, by bus and are asked to look for the PF police station requesting refuge, filling out a questionnaire in their own language and being interviewed by police officers. The PF issues a preliminary protocol that makes them \\"asylum seekers\\", obtaining the same rights as Brazilian citizens, such as access to health and education. They can also get a work permit, passport and CPF, and are officially registered in the country. After registration in the PF, the documentation goes to the National Committee for Refugees (Conare) and the National Immigration Council (Cnig), which open a process to evaluate the granting of permanent residence on a humanitarian basis, valid for up to 5 years. Haitians are not considered refugees in Brazil. Under Brazilian law, the refuge can only be granted to anyone who proves to be suffering persecution in their country for ethnic, religious or political reasons. However, due to the humanitarian crisis provoked by the catastrophe of 2010, the Brazilian government opened an exception, granting them a distinct visa. In April 2013, the government of Acre decreed a social emergency in the municipalities of Epitaciolândia and Brasileia as a consequence of the arrival of undocumented immigrants in these places, mostly Haitians. For months, an emergency shelter for immigrants worked in Brasileia. In April 2014, due to the flooding of the Madeira River, this already overcrowded shelter had to be closed, leaving not only Haitians but also migrants from other countries, such as Senegal, Nigeria, the Dominican Republic and Bangladesh. The undocumented situation of immigrants is largely a consequence of bureaucratic demands imposed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the entry of foreigners into the country. Besides Haitians, migrants from other countries began to use the border between Assis Brasil and the Peruvian city of Iñapari as the gateway to Brazil. As a result of the closure of the Brasileia shelter, the Acre government moved the immigrants to Rio Branco for a new makeshift shelter. Since April 8 and 9, 2014, the massive arrival of Haitians to the city of São Paulo without warning, on buses chartered by the government of Acre, has attracted the attention of the press, civil society and various humanitarian organizations. Upon arriving in the city of São Paulo, many of them seek the Peace Mission, an NGO linked to the Pastoral Care of Migrants. Founded by Scalabrinian religious, the Peace Mission operates in the parish of Our Lady of Peace, in the neighborhood of Glicério. Since 1939 in activity, the Mission receives 110 immigrants daily and from 60 to 70 nationalities per year. 650 Haitians went through the Peace Mission between April 7 and May 11, 2014. The organization serves migrants (internal and external) and refugees from around the world since its foundation in 1939. Father Paolo Parise, coordinator of the Mission, emphasizes the need for Brazil to have a clear humanist migration law, replacing Law 6,815, dated August 19, 1980 (Alien Statute), a \\"legacy of time of dictatorship \\". According to him, the country lacks a de facto migration policy, and the State - not civil society organizations - should be the protagonist in actions in favor of migrants. Haitians leave their country and their families mainly in search of work. \\"We do not believe that there are opportunities on the island, in Brazil everything is easier and it is the only place that is receiving the Haitians with humanity, in other countries it is a hell. \\"says Kenny Michaud, who has been in São Paulo for five months. In general, immigrants work to maintain themselves and also need to send money to their families in Haiti. In 2012, Haitian emigrants sent their relatives the equivalent of 22 percent of Haiti's gross domestic product (GDP), according to CIA data. Before the earthquake of 2010, which destroyed the country's infrastructure and provoked the wave of emigration, the impact of remittances on GDP did not reach 16%. According to the World Bank, the value of international remittances to Haiti reached US $1.82 billion in 2012 (before the earthquake, it was less than US $1.3 billion). The Central Bank of Brazil says it does not have information on the amount remitted by individuals or legal entities there since 2010, but Haitians working in Brazil say they send an average of R $500 a month to family members Deaths In the spring of 2007 a sloop overcrowded with at least 160 passengers left 82 dead. Some of the deceased were eaten by sharks say the survivors. In May 2009, similarly, nine Haitian migrants were killed when a boat loaded with approximately 30 passengers capsized. 124 Haitian migrants were repatriated to Haiti after attempting to reach the United States. The U.S. coast guard reported that a boat was intercepted at the end of July 2009. Approximately 200 Haitian migrants were on board a ship which capsized on Tuesday July 28, 2009 killing at least 11. The U.S. Coast Guard rescued 113 survivors in the shallow waters off the Turks and Caicos Islands coastline. Reports say that migrants may pay up to $500 to brokers for an opportunity to travel in these boats. The vessel had launched about three days ago. The ship hit a reef as they steered away from a police vessel in an attempt to hide. The injured are being cared for in a Caribbean Islands hospital. Lt-Cdr Matthew Moorlag of the US Coast Guard reported that approximately over 100 are illegal immigrants.

Helicopter stunts On July 2, 2012, Hample attempted to catch a baseball dropped from a helicopter 1,000 feet above LeLacheur Park in Lowell, Massachusetts. Wearing catcher's gear that was donated by Rawlings, Hample caught a softball dropped from a height of 312 feet. He then caught baseballs dropped from heights of 562 feet and 822 feet before the Federal Aviation Administration called off the stunt due to strong winds.Hample tries to catch history in Lowell, Minorleaguebaseball.com The 822-foot catch was initially thought to be 762 feet, but a discrepancy in the altimeter settings, which was captured on video and discovered months later, added 60 feet to the altitude.

He played for Dundee, Heart of Midlothian, Tranmere Rovers, St Johnstone and Greenock Morton. Returning to Hearts as a coach, he was in charge of the first team between 2007 and 2008, partially alongside Anatoliy Korobochka. Playing career Frail began his career with Archie Knox's Dundee in 1985, gradually developing into a first-team player by the end of the decade. He helped the Dens Park side to victory in the inaugural Scottish Challenge Cup in 1990–91, however his progress was hindered by a serious knee ligament injury, causing him to miss almost an entire season., Frail joined Hearts in a £130,000 deal in March 1994 and his form during the 1994–95 season as a right wingback led to media speculation of a call-up to the Scottish national side. Injury continued to hinder him though and in an away match at Dundee United on 21 March 1995 he suffered similar knee ligament damage to that he sustained while with Dundee. He missed the entire 1995–96 season and upon his return to fitness found his previous role in the team taken by Gary Locke. Unable to maintain a permanent position in the team he filled-in as a defensive midfielder when required as well as deputising for Locke but left Edinburgh for Merseyside when Tranmere Rovers paid £90,000 for his services in January 1998. Following a familiar pattern, Frail's time with Tranmere was decimated by injuries and he made less than 30 total appearances during his two seasons with the club. He is best remembered for his involvement in a controversial incident in an FA Cup tie with Sunderland, when a bureaucratic mix-up resulted in him being substituted on for Clint Hill who, unbeknown to Frail, had just been sent-off for a second bookable offence. After several minutes of commotion another player left the field to ensure Tranmere didn't avoid their punishment. Frail returned to Scotland with St Johnstone in 2000, signed for a second time by his former Hearts manager Sandy Clark. After a single season in Perth he moved to Greenock side Morton. Coaching career While at Morton, Frail began to become involved in coaching, firstly under Peter Cormack then former teammate at Hearts Dave McPherson. He retired from his playing role at the end of the 2001–02 season and became a full-time assistant to Morton's third manager within the year, John McCormack. McCormack was sacked in 2004, and Frail and the rest of the coaching staff left with him. Later that year, after attending Hearts UEFA Cup tie with Sporting Braga, he was invited to join their coaching staff by then manager Craig Levein. Initially coach of the under-19 side, he was promoted to become assistant coach when John McGlynn left to manage Raith Rovers in 2006. Frail, along with sporting director Anatoly Korobochka, took temporary charge of Hearts' first team in March 2007 after the departure of Valdas Ivanauskas. It was confirmed in June 2007 that Frail and Korobochka would take charge of the Jambos for the 2007–08 season with Bulgarian Angel Chervenkov coming in as assistant, though it was left ambiguous which one of the pair had responsibility for team selection. After poor form, which saw Hearts drop to tenth in the SPL, Frail was promoted to caretaker manager in January 2008 as the club planned to appoint a new permanent manager. It was announced Frail will be replaced as manager at the end of the 2007/08 season. In April 2009, Frail was appointed a coach at Celtic, working with their reserve and youth teams. He left this position on 1 September 2015. After leaving Celtic, Frail worked with the Scotland U16 team and scouted for Bolton Wanderershttps://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-frail-08085431 before the Irish Football Association appointed him to be full-time manager of the Northern Ireland Under 19 and Under 17 teams in August 2016.https://www.irishfa.com/news/2016/august/stephen-frail-appointed- northern-ireland-under-19-and-under-17-manager Frail returned to Scotland in July 2020, becoming assistant manager at Dundee United.

The word senso is Italian for \\"sense,\\" \\"feeling,\\" or \\"lust.\\" The title refers to the delight Livia experiences while reflecting on her affair with a handsome lieutenant. Originally, Visconti had hoped to cast Ingrid Bergman and Marlon Brando in the lead roles. However, Bergman was then married to Italian director Roberto Rossellini, who would not allow her to work for other directors, and Brando was rejected by the producers, who considered Granger a bigger star at the time. It is also said that Brando refused the role after being informed that Bergman was not going to participate in the film. Both Franco Zeffirelli and Francesco Rosi, later accomplished film and theater directors in their own right, worked as Visconti's assistants on the picture. Plot Senso is set in Italy around 1866, the year the Italian-Austrian war of unification would see the Veneto and most of Friuli-Venezia Giulia united to Italy after the Seven Weeks' War between Austria on one side and Prussia and Italy on the other. The story opens in the La Fenice opera house in Venice during a performance of Il Trovatore. At the close of Manrico's rousing aria Di quella pira, the opera is interrupted by a boisterous protest by Italian Nationalists against the occupying Austrian troops present in the theater. Livia Serpieri, an Italian countess, unhappily married to a stuffy older aristocrat, witnesses this and tries to conceal the fact that her cousin Marquis Roberto Ussoni has organized the protest. During the commotion, she meets a dashing young Austrian Officer named Franz Mahler, and is instantly smitten with him. The two begin a secret love affair. Despite the fact that Franz was responsible for sending Roberto into exile for his radical behavior, Livia vainly pretends not to be aware of it. Although Franz is obviously using Livia for her money and social status, Livia throws herself into an affair of complete sexual abandon with Franz, giving away her money and not caring what society thinks about her. But soon, Franz begins failing to show up for their trysts and Livia becomes consumed by jealousy and paranoia. The war finally forces the lovers apart, with Livia's husband taking her away to their villa in the country in order to avoid the carnage. Late one night, Franz arrives on the estate, and slips into Livia's bedroom. He asks her for more money to bribe the army doctors into keeping him off the battlefield; Livia complies, giving away all of the money she was holding for Roberto, who intended to supply it to the partisans fighting the Austrians. Livia's betrayal leads to tragic consequences; the Austrians overwhelm the under-equipped Italians. Eventually, Livia is almost driven mad by the fact that she is unable to see Franz, but rejoices when a letter from him finally arrives. In the letter, Franz thanks Livia for the financial support that helped him stay away from the front. He advises Livia not to look for him, but she does not listen. As soon as possible, Livia, still grasping the letter, boards a carriage and hurries to Verona to find her lover. Once there, Livia makes her way to the apartment, which she herself has rented for Franz. What she finds is a drunken, self-loathing rogue (Franz), in the company of a young prostitute, openly mocking Livia for accepting his abuse. After forcing her to sit and drink with the prostitute, Franz brutally throws Livia out of his rooms. She finds herself in the streets, filled with drunken, amorous Austrian soldiers. Livia realizes that she still has Franz's letter, but nothing remains now except mutual self-destruction. Her sanity slipping, Livia heads to the headquarters of the Austrian Army, where she hands Franz's letter to a General, thereby convicting Franz of treason. Although the General sees that Livia is acting out of spite for being cuckolded, he is forced to comply and Franz is executed by firing squad. Livia, now insane, runs off into the night, crying out her lover's name. Cast *Alida Valli as Countess Livia Serpieri *Farley Granger as Lt. Franz Mahler *Massimo Girotti as Roberto Ussoni *Heinz Moog as Count Serpieri *Rina Morelli as Laura, the maid *Marcella Mariani as Clara, a prostitute *Christian Marquand as a Bohemian officer *Sergio Fantoni as Luca, a farmer Production The novella is written in the form of a private diary, narrated in first person by Countess Livia (she is from Trento, not Venice like in the film). At the present time she is courted on and off by a lawyer, Gino, whom she constantly rebuffs. Narration switches back and forth between this subplot and the main plot, which take place 16 years apart (1865). Visconti focused on the main plot, deleting the diary subplot and the character of Gino entirely. The film pushes Livia's story into the background and gives more detail to the war itself while introducing a new subplot about Livia's nationalist cousin, Roberto Ussoni, who leads a rebellion against the Austrians. In the film, Livia gives his money to her lover, leading to a dramatic massacre of the Italian partisans, an episode not in Boito's original story. Visconti strayed so far away from the original source, that at one point he thought of renaming the film Custoza, after the big battle that occurs during the climax, but was denied due to legal reasons. The character of Franz Mahler is named Remigio Ruz in the novella; Visconti changed the name as a tribute to Gustav Mahler, one of his favourite composers, whose music features in the later Death in Venice. There's also a thematic connection with the film's opening, set in an opera; the scene does not feature in Boito's novella, where the protagonists first meet at a swimming bath. A truncated English-language version, recut to 94 minutes, was released with the title The Wanton Countess and contains dialogue written by Tennessee Williams and Paul Bowles. Reception G.R. Aldo's cinematography for the film received the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists' award. Visconti was nominated for the Golden Lion award at the 15th Venice International Film Festival. Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars, listing it as one of his \\"Great Movies.\\" Home media A digitally restored version of the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection in February 2011. The release includes The Wanton Countess, the rarely seen English-language version of the film, the Making of “Senso,” a new documentary featuring Rotunno, assistant director Francesco Rosi, costume designer Piero Tosi, and Caterina D’Amico, daughter of screenwriter Suso Cecchi D’Amico and author of Life and Work of Luchino Visconti, Viva VERDI, a new documentary on Visconti, Senso, and opera, a visual essay by film scholar Peter Cowie, and Man of Three Worlds: Luchino Visconti, a 1966 BBC program exploring Visconti’s mastery of cinema, theater, and opera direction. There is also a booklet featuring an essay by filmmaker and author Mark Rappaport and an excerpt from Granger's autobiography, Include Me Out. 2002 remake Poster for the Tinto Brass film Tinto Brass re-adapted the original source material as Senso '45 (retitled Black Angel for the international release) in 2002 when he read the novella and found himself unsatisfied with Visconti's rather liberal adaptation. The film starred Anna Galiena as Livia and Gabriel Garko as her lover. The story of the film is much more faithful to Camillo Boito's work than the earlier adaptation in terms of tone and story, but the action was transported from the War of Unification to the end of World War II, with Remigio becoming a Nazi Lieutenant and Livia updated to being the wife of a high ranking Fascist official. Brass later explained that the change in time was made because he did not want to compete with Visconti's vision of Risorgimento-era Italy. Unlike the 1954 version, Senso '45 did not romanticize the affair between Livia and Remigio/Mahler (now named \\"Helmut Schultz\\" in the new adaptation). Rather, the film showed it as a clinical study of vanity and lust. The film won Italian cinema's \\"Silver Ribbon\\" Award for best costume design.

His painting, Walkabout-A Warrior's Spirit portrays a historical person, Billy Walkabout, a Cherokee full-blood who was the most highly decorated Indian veteran of the Vietnam War. One of his most famous paintings is Brothers Gone but Not Forgotten, an acrylic painting from 2000, which portrayed a grieving man in a wheelchair touching the Vietnam War Memorial and faint images of fallen comrades can be seen in man's reflection. In this painting, Talmadge painted the names of each of the 238 Native Americans who died in the Vietnam War. Davis' work was part of a traveling exhibit that was featured at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington DC. He exhibited and regularly won awards at the Cherokee Heritage Center, Tulsa Indian Festival, Wichita Indian Market, and the Southwest Classic Art Show.\\"In Memory of Cherokee Artist Talmadge Davis.\\" Cherokee Heritage Center. 7 Nov 2005 (retrieved 7 April 2009) Notes References * Conley, Robert. \\"The Dawes Commission and Redbird Smith.\\" The Cherokee Nation: A History.

It is mostly found in Rhône wine blends and in northeast Spain. Its wines are characterized by high alcohol and low acidity, with citrus and or herbaceous notes. Its vigor can lead to overproduction and flabbiness. However, if yields are controlled, it can contribute flavor and length to blends, particularly with Roussanne. Since the 1980s, it has been the fifth most widely planted white wine grape in France after Ugni blanc, Chardonnay, Semillon and Sauvignon blanc.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 334 Oxford University Press 2006 History Grenache blanc is thought to have originated as a mutation of the red version of Grenache in Spain. It then spread across the Pyrenees to France, finding a second home in the Rhône.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 113 Harcourt Books 2001 Wine regions Grenache blanc is an important variety in the French wine region of the Rhône Valley, often blended with Roussanne in wines and even being included in some red wines. It is a major component in the white wines of the Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Côtes du Rhône AOCs. Up to 10% Grenache blanc is permitted to be included in the red wines of the Côtes du Rhône Villages AOC. In the Rivesaltes AOC, the grape is used as a blending component in some of the regions vin doux naturel wines. Nearly half of all Grenache blanc plantings in France are located in the Roussillon region where the grape is often blended with Roussanne, Marsanne, Viognier and Rolle. In the upper Agly Valley, varietal terroir driven examples are starting to be produced. In white Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Grenache Blanc provides fruitiness and fatness to a blend that often includes Roussanne, Picpoul, Bourboulenc and Clairette blanche.J. Molesworth \\"The Best White Wine That You're Not Drinking \\" Wine Spectator, December 15, 2007 =Other old world regions= In Spain it is mostly found in the Spanish wine regions along the Pyrenees, particularly in Navarra and the Terra Alta region in Catalonia. It is also widely planted in the Priorat, Alella and Aragon. It is permitted in the white wines of Rioja but is not widely used due to the tendency of the must to oxidize easily.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 245 Mitchell Beazley 1986 In Australia the variety known as \\"White Grenache\\" was identified by ampelographer Paul Truel as Biancone in 1976. Winemaking Grenache blanc responds best to low fermentation temperatures which produces a fresh, dill-scented wine in its youth. The grape is fairly flexible in winemaking and can be exposed to malolactic fermentation, extended skin maceration, lees stirring as well as oak aging. In addition to being blended with Roussanne, Grenache blanc is sometimes blended with Muscat and made in a varietal style.

Bush served as the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 until 2000, when he resigned as governor following his election as the 43rd President of the United States. As governor, Bush successfully sponsored legislation for tort reform, increased education funding, set higher standards for schools, and reformed the criminal justice system. Bush also pioneered faith-based welfare programs and helped make Texas the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the US. 1994 With his father George H. W. Bush's election to the United States Presidency in 1988, speculation had arisen among Republicans that George W. Bush would enter the 1990 Texas gubernatorial election. This was offset by Bush's purchase of the Texas Rangers baseball team and personal concerns regarding his own record and profile after which Bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 election, even as his brother Jeb first sought the governorship of Florida. Winning the Republican primary easily, Bush faced incumbent Governor Ann Richards, a popular Democrat who was considered the easy favorite, given Bush's lack of political credentials. Bush was aided in his campaign by a close coterie of political advisers that included Karen Hughes, a former journalist who was his communications adviser; Joe Allbaugh, who became his campaign manager, and Karl Rove, a personal friend and political activist who is believed to have been a strong influence in encouraging Bush to enter the election. Bush's aides crafted a campaign strategy that attacked Governor Richards' record on law enforcement, her political appointments, and her support of liberal political causes. Bush developed a positive image and message with themes of \\"personal responsibility\\" and \\"moral leadership.\\" His campaign focused on issues such as education (seeking more accountability for schools over student performance), crime, deregulation of the economy, and tort reform. Following an impressive performance in the debates, Bush's popularity grew. He won with 54.1 percent against Richards' 45.9 percent.; 1998 As a popular governor, Bush won re-election in a landslide victory with nearly 69 percent of the vote. He won 49 percent of the Latino vote and 27 percent of the African American vote, becoming the first Texas governor to be elected for two consecutive terms since Dolph Briscoe was re-elected in 1974. Within a year, he had decided to seek the Republican nomination for the Presidency. Capital punishment policy Under his leadership, Texas executed 154 prisoners (including Karla Faye Tucker e Betty Lou Beets), more than any previous governor in modern American history; critics such as Helen Prejean argue that he failed to give serious consideration to clemency requests. During his tenure, Bush presided over more executions of death row inmates than any other Governor in the history of Texas so far, surpassed only by his successor Rick Perry (Governor from 2000-2015). The rate averages an execution in the state every nine days.\\"The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins, Bantam Press, London, 2006 p. 291 The only death penalty case among the 155 that came across George W. Bush's desk in his tenure as Texas Governor in which Governor Bush intervened and commuted the death sentence was that of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas. Fiscal policy Seeking to reduce high property taxes to benefit homeowners while increasing general education funding, Bush sought to create business taxes, but faced vigorous opposition from his own party and the private sector. Failing to obtain political consensus for his proposal, Bush used a budget surplus to push through a $2 billion tax-cut plan, which was the largest in Texas history and cemented Bush's credentials as a pro-business fiscal conservative. To pay for the tax cuts, he sought federal approval of a plan to privatize Texas' social services. Bush also helped make Texas the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the US.Koronowski, Ryan.

A mighty wind Texas Monthly, August 2011. Accessed: 24 September 2011.Swift Boats and Texas Wind Wind Sector, 28 July 2011. Accessed: 24 September 2011. In 1995 Bush made wind power a key facet of Texas' renewable energy policy. Under a 1999 Texas state law, electric retailers are obliged to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources (RPS).SB7 Law textTexas Legislature Online, May 1999. Accessed: 24 September 2011.Texas Renewable Portfolio Standard Texas State Energy Conservation Office. Accessed: 24 September 2011.Texas Renewable Portfolio Standard Pew Center on Global Climate Change. Accessed: 24 September 2011. This environmentally progressive legislation is a striking counterpoint to the energy policies of his presidency that favored the status quo. Social policy Bush also pioneered faith-based welfare programs by extending government funding and support for religious organizations providing social services such as education, alcohol and drug abuse prevention, and reduction of domestic violence. As governor, he reached out to religious leaders such as Kirbyjon Caldwell (who would later offer the official benediction at Bush's presidential inauguration). He signed a memorandum on April 17, 2000 proclaiming June 10 to be Jesus Day in Texas, a day where he \\"urge[d] all Texans to answer the call to serve those in need.\\" Although Bush was criticized for allegedly violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment (\\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\\"), his initiative was popular with most people across the state, especially religious and social conservatives. In the 1996 United States Presidential Election, Bush criticized Republican nominee Bob Dole for trying to bring Pro-choice advocates into the party. Education policy Bush supported local control of schools, higher educational standards, and an updated academic curriculum. Charter schools mired in financial scandals. There were protests against one test determining a child's promotion.http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/tslac/40078/tsl-40078.html Appointments Right after his re-election, Bush named insurance commissioner Elton Bomer, a Democrat from Anderson County in East Texas, as the new Texas Secretary of State. He also appointed Michael L. Williams to the Texas Railroad Commission in 1999 upon the resignation of Carole Keeton Strayhorn (who was then known as Carole Keeton Rylander at the time), who resigned following her election as Comptroller of Public Accounts in 1998. Williams became the first African American to serve in an executive statewide office, and easily won a special election in 2000 for an unexpired term and was re-elected to six-year terms in 2002 and 2008.

Synopsis  Doug Montgomery, beauty products tycoon, is discovered dead in his Saint-Andrews manor. His favorite son Brett, who gave up the running of the family company to pursue a career in gynecology is opposed to his twin brother Brad gaining complete control of the company. Criquette, fiancée of Brett is then the victim of an attempted murder, suffering a gunshot wound to the chest. Emerge Ashley, her previously unknown twin sister and Peter, a rebellious police officer with rather unorthodox methods. It is by taking on the identity of her twin sister at Doug's funeral that Ashley tries to discover the identity of Criquette's assailant. The reading of Doug's will ignites family rivalries, leaving the company in a precarious position. It is then discovered that Brad is married to Becky Walters, the president of a similar company and that they will have a black baby, Chris, despite Brad's sterility. On April 28, 2005 the town of Saint- Andrews is hit by an enormous earthquake. It is not until the second series commences on 30 January 2006 that we learn who perished in and who survived the earthquake. Saint-Andrews then welcomes the arrival of Brenda Montgomery, the triplet sister of Brad and Brett. The viewer learns of the survival of Becky and Brett, who was buried alive by his brother Brad, who pretends to have lost his arms to claim a large compensation payout from the insurance company. Brenda takes possession of Montgomery International but is blown up during the Christmas special, which was shown in April 2006, setting the manor on fire, where the majority of the cast are stuck.

A participant in the 1989 Revolution, he has started his political career as a member of the National Salvation Front (FSN), representing its successor, the Democratic Party (PD) to the Chamber of Deputies. Additionally, Canacheu is an activist supporting the official recognition of Aromanians as an ethnic minority, being a founding member of the Aromanian Community Association (, ACAR) and the Aromanian Cultural Society (Societatea Culturală Aromână; Aromanian: Sutsata Culturala Armâneascâ).  Biography  Born to an Aromanian family in Budești, Călăraşi County, Canacheu graduated from the Electro-Energetic High School in Bucharest, and worked as a technician between 1978 and 1989. Profile at the Chamber of Deputies site Between 1993 and 2000, he was head of the Administrative Board for a Bucharest-based private enterprise, SC Neico Grup SA. He was an active participant in the Bucharest protests that led to the fall of the Nicolae Ceauşescu Communist government (December 1989), Răzvan Brăileanu, \\"Disidenţă, revoluţie, GDS\\" (\\"Dissidence, Revolution, GDS\\"), interview with Radu Filipescu , in 22, January 2004 and took part in the establishment of the FSN during February 1990, serving as a member of the FSN- based administration (CFSN, later CPUN) in Sector 1 of the capital, and later as a member of the FSN Directory Council. In the 1990 election, Canacheu won a seat in the Constituent Assembly for Bucharest. In this capacity, he notably initiated a legislative project regarding parliamentary control over intelligence agencies (namely, Serviciul Român de Informaţii, SRI) and their archives. In the early 1990s, Canacheu was among a group of former revolutionaries who, citing concerns that granting revolutionary certificates and privileges had become an instrument of corruption, formed the non- governmental organization Asociaţia Revoluţionarilor fără Privilegii (the Association of Non-Privileged Revolutionaries); other members include Ion Caramitru, Dan Pavel, Victor Rebengiuc, and Radu Filipescu. Following the September 1991 Mineriad, he joined Petre Roman's FSN faction which became, in 1995, the Democratic Party, and was its Executive Director for Organizing during the 1992 legislative election. Canacheu was head of the Municipal Electoral Committee in Bucharest (1994-1996), and, in late 1996, headed the campaign in favor of Anton Vătăşescu for the office of Mayor of Bucharest (Vătăşescu had received support from Uniunea Social-Democrată, USD, an alliance between the PD and the Romanian Social Democratic Party). Between 1997 and 1999, he was a member of the PD's Directory Council, and, from 1999 to 2001, head of the PD's Sector 1 branch. A member of the PD's Municipal Organization, Canacheu became a member of the party's National Coordinating Council (2000-2002) and the Executive Secretary of its National Permanent Bureau (2002). He became a PD deputy for Bucharest following the 2000 legislative election, and won the same seat as part of the Justice and Truth alliance during the 2004 election. Serving on the Committee for Defense, Public Order and National Security, of which he was president, Canacheu was also deputy member of the Romanian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. In late 2006, he proposed changes in Romanian legislation regarding access to classified information, arguing in favor of unrestricted parliamentary access to the latter (amended by the National Liberal senator Norica Nicolai, the project was eventually passed). \\"Parlamentarii vor avea acces la informaţii clasificate\\" (\\"MPs Will Have Access to Classified Information\\"), at BBC Romanian edition, November 30, 2006 Costică Canacheu supports the view that the 26,500 Aromanians in Romania (of whom approx. 1,300 speak Aromanian as their mother tongue) should be recognized as a separate ethnicity, and has proposed changes in the Law on Minorities. \\"Aromânii cer din nou recunoaşterea ca minoritate naţională\\" (\\"Aromanians Ask Again for Recognition as a National Minority\\"), in Divers, Spring 2006 Iuliana Gătej, \\"Aromânii vor statut minoritar\\" (\\"Aromanians Ask for Minority Status\\") , in Cotidianul, December 9, 2006 He also called on the Romanian Television to initiate special broadcasts in Aromanian at a national level.

Development is coordinated by the Ebbsfleet Development Corporation. It is named after the valley of the Ebbsfleet River, which it straddles. Although a small part of the site in the east lies within the borough of Gravesham, Ebbsfleet Valley primarily sits in the borough of Dartford. Toponymy The name Ebbsfleet is an artificial creation of a seventeenth-century antiquarian, partly inspired by the name of Ebbsfleet in Thanet, to the east.Keith Briggs, The two Ebbsfleets in Kent. Journal of the English Place-Name Society 44, 5–9 Redevelopment Southeastern British Rail Class 395 High Speed EMU at Ebbsfleet International station in 2009 Much of the land is brownfield and was formerly used by industry; having been previously owned by the APCM, Blue Circle and most recently by Lafarge. The new community is planned to have a population of 40,000. Ebbsfleet International railway station was opened in November 2007 and provides services to Continental Europe on High Speed 1. Domestic services to St Pancras railway station in central London are operated by Southeastern. In March 2014, the British government announced its intention to construct a garden city at Ebbsfleet for up to 15,000 homes. In November 2015, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer attempted to kick start the project by injecting £300 million. Richard Rogers, a former government adviser on cities, said: \\"They shouldn’t be building down there. East London still has masses of brownfield land, so why are we building 15 miles out? This is not a sustainable option.\\" = Criticisms = The development is referred to as a garden city, intended to be sustainable with publicly owned infrastructure and facilities, with inhabitants working on the estates. This was said to be inspired by the Stockholm suburbs such as Hammarby where the design there is to have cycleways, and 1,500 self-build homes, houseboats and parkland. The planning committee chair, Derek Hunnisett, said \\"We are looking for a higher quality than the normal and what we are getting [so far] is the norm – standard off-the-peg stuff.\\". Despite Ebenezer Howard's vision for garden cities to be leafy, with ample plots and a lower density than other developments: \\"air and water, woods and churches... in gardens with pretty self contained cottages.. there should be an abundance of living room, playing room and living room\\" Ebbsfleet Garden City will not adhere to the same key design principles of a garden city. Ebbsfleet will be a much higher density housing development than an actual garden city of \\"30 persons per hectare\\". This already features multi-storey flats, and dense road layouts dominated by private parking and passageways for cars. The nearest house is less than 20 minutes walk to Ebbsfleet International station.Google Directions The current development already contradicts policy and academic papers written in recent times to inform the coalition government's 'blueprint'. \\"A strong landscape structure, that matures over time to create a leafy green character. Tree lined streets, green verges and planted front gardens\\". =London Paramount Entertainment Resort= In a contradictory move, in the following May, London Paramount Entertainment Resort were given permission to build a theme park on potential housing land on the adjoining Swanscombe Peninsula site, Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project status, allowing the developers to bypass local planning requirements and build a leisure complex that by 2019 may create employment for 27,000 people. Highways England consulted, in early 2017, about improvements to the A2 junctions in the area, citing a traffic increase of 200%. =Telecommunications= There will be a trial by BT of a fibre network in the Ebbsfleet valley, potentially offering the highest speed internet connection to home users in the United Kingdom, with the exception of Ashford in Kent. It has been confirmed they will be offering speeds of 100Mbit/s which will transfer TV, Broadband and Telephone via optical fibre. Businesses and residents of the area will be given a new telephone dialling code, 01987, though the small number of users who already have numbers allocated from the neighbouring codes (01322 or 01474) are able to retain them. The 01987 code was adopted in April 2008, in preference to the vacant 01321 code. Archaeology The Ebbsfleet River is of great historical importance in English history and prehistory, and much archaeological excavation has taken place here over the years. Quarrying here has revealed signs of extensive occupation some 100,000 years ago: flint knapping was carried out here, the remains of a straight-tusked elephant have been found. Distinctive pottery from the Neolithic age has been discovered; such pots give their name to an important sub-culture of the period.The Book of Gravesham, Sidney Harker, 1979, Barracuda Books Ltd British History Online: The Neolithic Age Belgic Britons, in the late Iron Age have left behind traces of their culture. Prior to the construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link in this area, archaeological work undertaken at Ebbsfleet found an Anglo-Saxon mill. The river, which is fed by eight natural springs at Springhead (), was held sacred by the Celts who settled in the area around 100 BC.Springhead: the temple complex They were followed by the Romans; their Watling Street passes through the site, and a villa has been excavated. Many of the local chalk quarries were started by the Romans, possibly for cement manufacture and flint. The quarries were later expanded, in line with the industrial revolution, by Joseph Parker and others. A large flooded quarry, Sawyer's Lake, can be found nearby. Transport Ebbsfleet International railway station is served by Southeastern High Speed and Eurostar services. Ebbsfleet is served by Arriva bus services 484 and 485. Civic identity The football team Gravesend and Northfleet FC changed their name to Ebbsfleet United F.C. in the summer of 2007. Another move to promote a sense of identity in the new town is a planned landmark, which when built will be high (twice as high as the Angel of the North) and is intended to be visible from road, rail and air.

Historically it was a peninsula on the southern coast of the Isle of Thanet, marking the eastern end of the Wantsum Channel that separated Thanet from the Kentish mainland. It is in the civil parish of Minster Since Pegwell Bay was a natural harbour on the part of the coast nearest to the Continent, Ebbsfleet is said to have been the site of three important arrivals in English history: Julius Caesar in 54BC built a 20 ha fort during his incursion; Hengist and Horsa in 449 AD, who led the English in their conquest of Britain; and Augustine of Canterbury in 597 AD, who converted much of England to Christianity. Ebbsfleet is the titular see of the Bishop of Ebbsfleet, an episcopal visitor for the Province of Canterbury. Geography Ebbsfleet Lane marks the line of the peninsula today. The Wantsum Channel silted up and was reclaimed in the 15th century; all that remains of it is the channel of the River Stour, which enters the sea by Richborough Power Station. There are a couple of houses and Ebbsfleet House at Stonelees, where Ebbsfleet Lane meets the Sandwich road, and Ebbsfleet Farm on the hill behind. History There are prehistoric, Iron Age, Roman, and Saxon settlement remains on the peninsula around Ebbsfleet Farm, which may have also been the landing stage for the Roman ferry across the channel to Richborough. Archaeologists suggest that Pegwell Bay was the site of both Roman invasions of Britain. Claudius landed his army at Richborough on the other side of the channel, to start his invasion of 43 AD, and it became a major port of Roman Britain. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle it is also the site of the landings made by the Saxons in the fifth century AD; an entry states that Hengist and Horsa, on the invitation of Vortigern, King of the Britons, landed in 449 at Eopwinesfleot, usually assumed to be Ebbsfleet.Keith Briggs, The two Ebbsfleets in Kent. Journal of the English Place-Name Society 44, 5–9 A ' is a creek and Eopwine is a Germanic personal name; the modern Ebbsfleet may have developed from Eoppa/Eobba, a short form of this name. There is the common sense possible alternative derivation from the Old English , to move away from (of West Germanic source) describing the twice daily phenomenon of all the water in the Wantsum channel 'moving away' from land at this outlet to the sea.https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ebb A third possibility is that Eopwines represents a corruption of the last three syllables of Portus Rutupinus, the Latin name of the ancient Wantsum Channel. The arrival of the Saxons is commemorated by a monument and replica longship up the coast at Cliffsend. The Battle of Wippedesfleot between the Britons and the English in 465 is thought to have taken place at Ebbsfleet. Bede wrote in his Ecclesiastical History: \\"On the east of Kent is the large Isle of Thanet containing, according to the English way of reckoning, 600 families, divided from the other land by the river Wantsum, which is about three furlongs over, and fordable only in two places, for both ends of it run into the sea. In this island landed the servant of our Lord, Augustine, and his companions, being, as is reported, nearly forty men. They had, by order of the blessed Pope Gregory, taken interpreters of the nation of the Franks.\\" This has been interpreted to mean Ebbsfleet was where Augustine landed. In 1884, St Augustine's Cross was erected on the lane between Cliffsend and Sevenscore to commemorate his first sermon in Kent.Date and text of the inscription. Energy Richborough Power Station to the south was operational from 1962 to 1996; the towers were demolished in 2012. The power lines are being reused for the Thanet Wind Farm in the sea off Broadstairs. Ebbsfleet Solar Farm is on the site of the former Richborough Power Station. It has a capacity of 4.9 MWp and became operational in 2011.Ebbsfleet Solar Farm The solar farm is part of a larger ongoing project, Richborough Energy Park. Archaeology The site of Julius Caesar's landing in Britain on 4 July 54 BC had been a source of dispute. It was assumed that a fort would have been built to protect the landing, and none had been found. On 29 November 2017, archaeologists from University of Leicester announced that during the excavation they had done at Ebbsfleet, fortifications had been found.

The city formally was incorporated in 1736. The city was burned by orders of the outgoing British Colony of Virginia colonial governor in 1776 during the second year of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), although it was soon rebuilt. The 19th century proved to be a time of numerous travails for both the city of Norfolk, and the region as whole. War, epidemics, fires, and economic depression reduced the development of the city. The city grew into the region's economic hub. By the late 19th century, the Norfolk and Western Railway with its line to the west established the community as a major coal ore exporting port and built a large trans-loading facility at Lambert's Point. It became the terminus for numerous other railroads, linking its ports to inland regions of Virginia and North Carolina, and at the turn of the 20th century, the coal mining regions of Appalachia were well connected to the port on the East Coast. Princess Anne and Norfolk counties would become leaders in truck farming, producing over half of all greens and potatoes consumed on the East Coast. Lynnhaven oysters also became a major export. The region's African Americans achieved full emancipation following the Civil War (1861–1865), after the initial Emancipation Proclamation by 16th President Abraham Lincoln in 1862–1863, supplemented later by the three post-war constitutional amendments during the Reconstruction era (1865–1877), only to be faced with severe discrimination through white legislators' later imposition by the 1890s of Jim Crow Laws. After Virginia passed a new post-war state constitution, African Americans were essentially disfranchised for more than 60 years until their leadership and activism won passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s. In 1907, it was host to the Jamestown Exposition commemorating the tercennary (300th anniversary) of the first English settlement at Jamestown on the James River, the only world's fair to ever be held in Virginia. As a result of its publicity and visits by high-ranking officials during the exposition (in which the Great White Fleet, of 26th President Theodore Roosevelt with the rebuilt United States Navy after the Spanish–American War of 1898 was launched from Hampton Roads harbor), it became the later location of the Norfolk Naval Station. Today, the city of Norfolk is a major American naval and world shipping hub, as well as the center of the Hampton Roads region, both on the southside and the peninsula to the north of the extensive harbor between the James and York Rivers, with the railroad terminus and ship construction port of Newport News from the 19th century on the west shore and Hampton on the south and east sides, dating back to its founding in the colonial era as Virginia's original port. Pre- colonial The first evidence of humans inhabiting Virginia is from 9,500 BC. In 1584, Sir Walter Raleigh led an expedition in search of a suitable place to establish a permanent English settlement in North America. By mid-July of that year, two of his ships had landed on Roanoke Island (now a part of Dare County). Arthur Barlowe, one of Raleigh's commanders, kept a journal which states the area was inhabited by a tribe of Native Americans called the Chesepian. According to Barlowe, the local Chesepians claimed that a nearby city called Skicoak was the Chesepians' greatest city. However, the exact location of Skicoak has remained undetermined. When Jamestown settlers arrived at Cape Henry (in present-day Virginia Beach) almost 23 years later in April 1607, they found no traces of Skicoak. According to William Strachey's The Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britanica (1612), the Chesepians had been wiped out by Chief Wahunsunacock (better known as Chief Powhatan), the head of the Virginia Peninsula-based Powhatan Confederacy in the intervening years. Colonial period (1607–1775) In 1607, the Governor for the Virginia Colony, Sir George Yeardley established four incorporations, termed \\"citties\\" for the developed portion of the colony. These citties were to form the basis for the government of the colony in the newly created House of Burgesses, with the southeastern portion of the Hampton Roads region falling under the Elizabeth Cittie incorporation. In 1622, Adam Thoroughgood (1604–1640) of King's Lynn, Norfolk, England, became one of the earliest Englishmen to settle in the area that was to become South Hampton Roads, when at the age of 18 he became an indentured servant to pay for passage to the Virginia Colony. After his period of contracted servitude was finished, he earned his freedom and soon became a leading citizen of the fledgling colony. Meanwhile, after years of continuing struggles at Jamestown, the now bankrupt Virginia Company had its royal charter revoked by King James I in 1624 and Virginia became a crown colony. Also at this time, the King granted of land to Thomas Willoughby, in what is now the Ocean View section of the city. The entire population of the Virginia colony was estimated to be 5,000 people at this time. In 1629, Thoroughgood was elected to the House of Burgesses for Elizabeth Cittie. Five years later, in 1634, the King had the colony reorganized under a system of 8 shires, with much of the Hampton Roads region becoming part of Elizabeth City Shire. In 1636, Thoroughgood was granted a large land holding along the Lynnhaven River for having persuaded 105 people to settle in the colony. Thoroughgood is also credited with suggesting the name of Norfolk, in honor of his birthplace. New Norfolk County was created when the South Hampton Roads portion of Elizabeth City Shire was partitioned off in that same year. Also during this reorganization, King James granted a further to Willoughby. This land would become the city of Norfolk in future. Shortly thereafter, in 1637, New Norfolk County was itself split into two counties, Upper Norfolk County and Lower Norfolk County. The modern city of Norfolk is located in Lower Norfolk. In 1649 the English couple William and Susannah Moseley migrated with their family to Lower Norfolk County. On the Eastern Branch Elizabeth River from Norfolk, they built a manor house with Dutch-style gambrel roof which later became known as Rolleston Hall. Rolleston Hall stood more than 200 years, until it burned down in the late 19th century. Rolleston Hall The Wise and Terry Letters: Gov. Wise Wants to Reoccupy His Old Home... In 1670, a royal decree directed the \\"building of storehouses to receive imported merchandise ... and tobacco for export\\" for each of the colony's 20 counties. This marked the beginning of Norfolk's importance as a port city, due to its natural deepwater channels. Soon after 1673, the \\"Half Moone\\" fort at the site of what is now Town Pointe Park. This fort was constructed due to feared attack by the Dutch, but this threat did not materialize. Norfolk quickly grew in size, and by 1682 a charter for the establishment of the \\"Towne of Lower Norfolk County\\" had been issued by Parliament. Norfolk was one of only three cities in the Virginia Colony to receive a royal charter, the other two being Jamestown and Williamsburg. The town initially encompassed a land area northeast of the point of the confluence of the Eastern and Southern Branches of the Elizabeth River (today the point is in downtown). In 1691, a final county subdivision took place when Lower Norfolk County was split to form Norfolk County (present day Norfolk, Chesapeake, and parts of Portsmouth) and Princess Anne County (present day Virginia Beach). Norfolk was incorporated in 1705 and re- chartered as a borough in 1736. In 1753, Lt. Governor Robert Dinwiddie presented the growing city of 4,000 with a long, 104 ounce silver mace. The mace was a symbol of royal authority and is currently displayed in the Chrysler Museum of Art. By 1775, Norfolk had developed into one of the most prosperous cities in Virginia. It was a major shipbuilding center and an important trans-shipment point for the export of goods such as tobacco, corn, cotton, and timber from Virginia and North Carolina, to the British Isles and beyond. In turn, goods from the West Indies such as rum and sugar, and finished manufactured products from England, were imported back through Norfolk and shipped to the rest of the lower colonies. Much of the West Indies and American colonial products that flowed through the harbor were by this time produced with the use of slave labor. Revolutionary War (1775–1783) Saint Paul's Episcopal Church Norfolk had been a strong base of Loyalist support throughout the start of the American Revolution. In the early summer of 1775, Lord Dunmore, the last Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia, tried to reestablish control of the colony from Norfolk. In November, a battle took place at Kemp's Landing which provided Dunmore and the loyalists a clear victory, but it was nonetheless clear by then that the war was escalating. The governor immediately issued Dunmore's Proclamation, which promised freedom to any rebel-owned slave who joined His Majesty's forces. At the end of November, Dunmore set up a stronghold in Norfolk,Virginia Gazette (Dixon & Hunter) (2 Dec 1775, page 3) via research.history.org- accessed 2008-01-03 demolishing some 30 houses in the course of its construction. A few days later, based on false intelligence received, Dunmore's 600 soldiers were defeated in the Battle of Great Bridge, where 102 of Dunmore's soldiers were killed or injured, compared with just one injured soldier for the patriots.Virginia Gazette (Pinkney) (13 December 1775, page 2), via research.history.org- accessed 2008-01-03 Dunmore and their loyalists fled Norfolk and boarded their ship, thus ending 168 years of British colonial rule in Virginia. Dunmore remained in the river off Norfolk with a small squadron of armed ships and on New Year's Day 1776, Lord Dunmore's ships began a bombardment that escalated into the Burning of Norfolk. British troops also went ashore to burn down all the waterfront buildings, and thus played right into the hands of their enemies. The rebels were quite happy to see a largely Loyalist city destroyed, happier still to be able to blame it on the British, and over the next two days they encouraged the spread of fires, while looting unburned houses.Guy, Louis L. jr. Norfolk's Worst Nightmare Norfolk Historical Society Courier, Spring 2001, accessed 2008-01-03 The Virginia Assembly found that of the 882 houses burned during those two days, only 19 had been set alight by the British. A further 416—in effect, all that remained standing—were destroyed in February 1776 to prevent the British from using them as cover if they returned.Eckenrode, H.J.The Revolution in Virginia (chap. III: The Struggle for Norfolk) Boston MA, Houghton Mifflin (1916), via newrivernotes.com- accessed 2008-01-03Virginia Auditor of Public Accounts: records of Commissioners to examine claims in Norfolk, 1777–1836. (Library of Virginia archives, ref. APA 235) Only Saint Paul's Episcopal Church survived the bombardment and subsequent fires, however the church was dented by a cannonball fired by the Liverpool. Antebellum: rebirth, fire, and disease (1783–1861) Market Square in Norfolk Joseph Jenkins Roberts, born and raised in Norfolk; first President of Liberia Four years after the Revolutionary War, a fire along the city's waterfront destroyed some 300 buildings and the city experienced a serious economic setback as a result. At the turn of the 19th century, Fort Norfolk was constructed by the Federal government to guard the harbor. During the 1820s the agricultural communities of South Hampton Roads experienced a prolonged recession, resulting in the emigration of families from the region to other areas of the South, especially the frontier areas being opened for settlement. From 1820 to 1830, there was a drop in overall population of about 15,000 in Norfolk County, despite the fact that other urban areas experienced significant population growth. Like other Southern states, Virginia struggled with slavery, especially as it became less important in the mixed agricultural economy that was replacing that of tobacco. Virginia considered ideas to either phase out slavery through law (see Thomas Jefferson Randolph's 1832 resolution) or to \\"repatriate\\" blacks by sending them to Africa to establish a colony at Liberia. The American Colonization Society (ACS), established in 1816, was the largest of groups founded for that purpose. Many emigrants from Virginia and North Carolina embarked for Africa from Norfolk. One such emigrant was Joseph Jenkins Roberts, a native of Norfolk who would go on to become the first president of Liberia. Active emigration through the ACS came to an end following the Civil War. By 1840, Norfolk's population was 10,920 for the borough proper (not including the rest of the county). With the concentration of population came more interest in education and culture. In 1841 an ambitious new school building was completed for Norfolk Academy, designed by Thomas U. Walter as a replica of the temple of Theseus in Athens. In 1845, Norfolk was incorporated as a city. By 1850 the city's population was approximately 14,000 persons, including 4,000 enslaved African Americans and 1,000 free blacks. Transportation improvements contributed to growth. In 1832 the steam ferry Gosport began service, linking Norfolk and Portsmouth. In 1851, the Commonwealth authorized the charter of an railroad connecting busy port of Norfolk and the growing industrial city of Petersburg. Completed in 1858, this important line was the predecessor of today's Norfolk Southern Railway. On June 7, 1855, the ship Benjamin Franklin detoured into Portsmouth for urgent repairs. The city's health officer inspected the ship, as was standard practice at the time, and suspected something was awry, despite assurances from the captain that ship was free of disease. The officer ordered that the ship be held at anchor in the harbor for 11 days. Afterwards, he returned to the ship and allowed it dock under the condition that the ship's hold not be broken. Within several days of the ship's docking, however, the first cases of yellow fever appeared in people whose homes were near the wharf. By July, the epidemic was in full outbreak and would eventually result in the deaths of over 3,000 people in the region, 2,000 of them in Norfolk. At its peak, the epidemic was claiming more than 100 lives a day in Norfolk alone.Norfolk from 1845–1887 :Neighborhood Histories : Neighborhood Services – City of Norfolk, VA The city's population did not reach that of the 1850 census again until after the Civil War. In 1856 the Sisters of Charity founded St. Vincent's Hospital, in part as a reaction to the previous year's epidemic. American Civil War In early 1861, Norfolk voters instructed their delegate to vote for ratification of the ordinance of secession. Soon thereafter, Virginia voted to secede from the Union. Richmond became the capital of the Confederacy, and the American Civil War began. When Virginia joined the Confederate States of America they demanded the surrender of all Federal property in their state, including the Norfolk Navy Yard (then called the Gosport Shipyard). Falling for an elaborate Confederate ruse orchestrated by civilian railroad builder, and future Confederate general, William Mahone, the Union shipyard commander Charles Stewart McCauley ordered the burning of the shipyard and the evacuation of its personal to Fort Monroe across Hampton Roads. The capture of the shipyard allowed a tremendous amount of war material to fall into Confederate hands including the remains of the burned and scuttled naval frigate USS Merrimac. In the spring of 1862, the remains of the USS Merrimac were rebuilt at Norfolk Navy Yard as an ironclad and renamed as the CSS Virginia. The Battle of Hampton Roads began on March 8. The battle would ultimately ended in a stalemate however, as neither navy was able to do significant damage to the other due to the heavy armor plating. Over the next several months, CSS Virginia tried in vain to engage the Monitor, but the USS Monitor was under strict orders not to fight unless absolutely necessary. On May 6, while the Union Army under General George B. McClellan was fighting the Peninsula Campaign, President Abraham Lincoln visited Fort Monroe across Hampton Roads. Recognizing the value of Norfolk, he decided on a plan to capture the city and thus eliminate the base for the CSS Virginia. On May 8, Union ships, including the USS Monitor and batteries on Fort Wool opened fire on the Confederate batteries on Sewell's Point. Only the approach of the CSS Virginia drove the Union ships back to the protection of Fort Monroe. At this point, Lincoln directed the invasion to be on Willoughby Spit, away from the Confederate batteries, the next day. On the morning of May 10, General John Wool landed 6,000 Union soldiers on Willoughby Spit. Within hours, the Union troops arrived at Norfolk. Mayor William Lamb surrendered the city without firing a shot. For the duration of the Civil War, the city was held under Martial law. Many private and public buildings were confiscated for federal use, including nearby plantations. Mayor Lamb did manage to successfully hide the city's colonial era silver mace underneath a fireplace hearth to avoid having it confiscated or melted down by union troops. Enslaved African Americans did not wait until the end of the war to be emancipated. With the arrival of Union troops, thousands of slaves escaped to Norfolk and Fort Monroe to claim their freedom. Even before the arrival of northern missionaries, African Americans began to set up schools for children and adults both. Reconstruction to the Jamestown Exposition (1865–1907) Logo for Jamestown Exposition in 1907 By 1870, the end of Reconstruction was at hand in Norfolk. Union occupation troops withdrew and Virginia was readmitted to the Union. During this time, African-Americans throughout Hampton Roads were elected to state and local offices. Gradually they were restricted from office and voting by the whites' paramilitary violence and intimidation, and increasingly discriminatory legislation, including Jim Crow Laws to control work, segregated public facilities and transportation, and other aspects of life. Most significantly, in 1902 Virginia joined other Southern states in creating a new constitution that effectively disfranchised all African Americans through creating new blocks to voter registration that were selectively and subjectively applied against them. White supremacists achieved their goal: from 1900 to 1904, estimated black voter turnout in the Presidential elections in Virginia dropped to zero.Richard H. Pildes, \\"Democracy, Anti-Democracy and the Canon\\", Constitutional Commentary, vol.17, 2000, p.12 accessed 10 Mar 2008 African Americans would not regain the ability to exercise suffrage and full civil rights until their activism in the Civil Rights Movement secured passage of federal legislation in the mid-1960s. Despite this severe restriction, many African Americans created families, churches, schools, community organizations and stable lives for themselves. Many became landowners and farmed small plots in the Norfolk area. The area's turn to mixed agriculture before the Civil War created a more favorable environment for small plots and mixed produce. Map of the city of Norfolk and Norfolk County, Virginia, 1895 In 1883, the first car of bituminous coal arrived from the Pocahontas fields over the Norfolk & Western Railway and by 1886 the tracks were extended right up to the coal piers at Lambert's Point to handle the increasing volume, creating one of the largest coal transshipment ports in the world. In 1894, classes began in the city's first public high school. That same year the new technology of the electric street railway was introduced to Norfolk and would, within ten years, link Norfolk with Sewell's Point, Ocean View, South Norfolk, Berkley, Pinner's Point (all of which were independent communities within Norfolk County at that time), and the neighboring City of Portsmouth. 1907 brought both the Virginian Railway and the Jamestown Exposition to Sewell's Point. The large Naval Review at the Exposition demonstrated the peninsula's favorable location, laying the groundwork for the world's largest naval base. Commemorating the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the exposition brought many prominent people including President Theodore Roosevelt, congressmen, senators, and diplomats from 21 countries. Henry Huttleston Rogers and Mark Twain also attended the expo. Many naval ships from different countries were present for the celebration. The area where the exposition took would become Naval Air Station Hampton Roads, later Naval Station Norfolk, ten years later in 1917, during the height of World War I. =Resort areas and transportation development= Resort areas in remote areas along the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean grew in the period after the civil war as Norfolk residents embraced the concept of the day trips to the beaches. Ocean View on the bay in Norfolk County was originally surveyed for lots before the war, but establishment of a long narrow gauge steam passenger railroad service between downtown Norfolk and Ocean View crossing what was then known as Tanner's Creek (later renamed Lafayette River) brought the masses. Originally named the Ocean View Railroad, it was later known as the Norfolk and Ocean View Railroad. A small steam locomotive named the General William B. Mahone hauled ever increasing volumes of passengers, primarily on the weekends. Similarly, the Norfolk & Virginia Beach Railway inaugurated rail service in 1883 http://www.npl.lib.va.us/history/history48.html to the rural community of Seatack located on the Atlantic Ocean in Princess Anne County. The oceanfront area at Seatack became the site of the area's first resort hotel. As attendance boomed, in both instances, the steam-powered services between downtown Norfolk and the beaches at Ocean View and Seatack were later replaced by electric-powered trolley cars. These in turn, were later replaced by highways and the automobile. Cottage Toll Road, later largely superseded by Tidewater Drive led to Ocean View. Leading from Norfolk to Seatack, where the resort strip became known as Virginia Beach, in 1922, the new hard-surfaced Virginia Beach Boulevard was a major factor in the growth of the Oceanfront town and adjacent portions of Princess Anne County. Ocean View gradually evolved into a streetcar suburb, and was annexed by Norfolk in 1923. Virginia Beach became an incorporated town in 1906, and an independent city of the second class in 1952, sharing courts and some constitutional officers with Princess Anne County. 11 years later, the city was politically consolidated with county (which was 100 times larger in land area)to form the modern City of Virginia Beach, now the City of Norfolk's neighbor to the east, part of a wave of political consolidations in the Hampton Roads region which took place between 1952 and 1976. Modern Era =Expansion through annexation (1906–1959)= The Norfolk Terminal Station which opened in 1912 Norfolk continued to grow in the first half of the 20th century as it expanded its borders through annexation. In 1906, the incorporated town of Berkley was annexed, stretching the city limits across the Elizabeth River. The town became a borough along with the neighborhoods of Beacon Light and Hardy Field. Lambert's Point, home of a railroad pier, and Huntersville were annexed into Norfolk five years later in 1911. In 1923, the city limits were expanded to include Sewell's Point, Willoughby Spit, the town of Campostella, and Ocean View, adding the naval base and miles of beach property fronting on Hampton Roads and Chesapeake Bay. The Norfolk Naval Base grew rapidly as a result of World War I and this created a housing shortage in the area. These newly incorporated areas grew rapidly along with the 1906-created Larchmont neighborhood, five miles (8 km) from downtown. Wards Corner, then just outside Norfolk, became the first non-downtown shopping district in the country. In 1930, Old Dominion University was established as the Norfolk Division of the College of William & Mary. ODU awarded its first bachelor's degrees in 1956 and became an independent institution in 1962. Five years later, Norfolk State University was founded as the Norfolk Unit of Virginia State University and became an independent institution in 1969. By 1950, Norfolk was the fifth fastest growing metropolitan area in the United States. As a result of the end of World War II, another housing shortage was created. In 1955, Tanners Creek was annexed and ownership of Broad Creek Village transferred to Housing Authority. Norfolk had officially become the largest city in state, with a population of 297,253. After a smaller annexation in 1959, and a 1988 land swap with Virginia Beach, the city assumed its current boundaries. =Highway developments= Hampton Roads Bridge TunnelWith the dawn of the Interstate Highway System, new highways opened and a series of bridges and tunnels opening over fifteen years would link Norfolk with the Peninsula, Portsmouth, and Virginia Beach. On November 1, 1957, the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel opened to traffic, connecting the Virginia Peninsula with the city, signed as State Route 168. The new two-lane toll bridge-tunnel connection became a portion of Interstate 64 by the end of 1957, connecting Norfolk westward with a limited access freeway. A second parallel tube was built in 1976, expanding the road to four lanes. The two-lane Midtown Tunnel was completed September 6, 1962. On December 1, 1967, the Virginia Beach-Norfolk Expressway (Interstate 264 and State Route 44), a long toll road leading from Baltic Avenue in Virginia Beach to Brambleton Avenue in Norfolk, opened to traffic at a cost of $34 million. In 1991, the new Downtown Tunnel/Berkley Bridge complex was completed, with a new system of multiple lanes of highway and interchanges connecting Downtown Norfolk and Interstate 464 with the Downtown Tunnel tubes. =Racial segregation in schools (1958–1960)= In 1954, the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision determined that racial segregation in public schools (and public accommodations) was unconstitutional. However, Virginia pursued a policy to avoid desegregation that came to be called Massive Resistance. Among the actions were new state laws, called the Stanley Plan, that prohibited state funding for integrated public schools, even as some school districts began to contemplate them. It was a few years after Brown until the policy was tested. Norfolk's private schools had been integrated four years before as the city chose to voluntarily comply with the Brown decision. However, a number of public school divisions (school districts) around the state had been reluctant to do so for fear of losing state funds. In 1958, Federal District Courts in Virginia ordered schools in Arlington County, Charlottesville, Norfolk, and Warren County, to desegregate. In the fall of 1958, a handful of public schools in three of these widespread areas opened for the first time on a racially integrated basis. In response, Virginia Governor J. Lindsay Almond Jr. ordered the schools to be closed, including six of the Norfolk Public Schools: Granby High School, Maury High School, Norview High School, Blair Junior High School, Northside Junior High School, and Norview Junior High School. In Norfolk, the state action had the impact of locking ten thousand children out of school, which raised outcry by the public to a high level. As some children attended makeshift schools in churches, etc., the citizens voted whether to reopen the public schools. The ballot made clear that the Commonwealth of Virginia would stop funding integrated schools. On January 19, 1959, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals declared the state law to be in conflict with Virginia's state constitution. The Court of Appeals ordered all public schools to be funded, whether integrated or not. Governor Almond capitulated about ten days later and asked the sitting General Assembly to rescind several \\"Massive Resistance\\" laws. On February 2, 1959, Norfolk's public schools were desegregated when 17 black children entered six previously all-white schools in Norfolk. Virginian-Pilot editor Lenoir Chambers editorialized against massive resistance, earning the Pulitzer Prize. =Decline and revitalization (1960 onward)= Historic Monticello Arcade As the traditional center of shipping and port activities in the Hampton Roads region, Norfolk's downtown waterfront historically played host to numerous port and shipping-related uses. With the advent of containerized shipping in the mid-20th century, the shipping uses located on Norfolk's downtown waterfront became obsolete as larger and more modern port facilities opened elsewhere in the region. In the second half of the century, Norfolk had a vibrant retail community in its suburbs. Norfolk was also the birthplace of Econo-Travel, now Econo Lodge, one of the nation's first discount motel chains. Similarly, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's Granby Street commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. Granby Street traditionally played the role as the premiere shopping and gathering spot in the Hampton Roads region and numerous department stores such as Smith & Welton (1898–1988), Rice's (1918–1985) and Ames and Brownley (1898–1973), hotels and theaters once lined its sidewalks. However, new suburban shopping developments promised more convenience and comfort to the population that had moved to the suburbs. Pembroke Mall in Virginia Beach, the region's first climate-controlled shopping mall, and JANAF Shopping Center in Norfolk's Military Circle area, were built in this era. Beginning in the 1970s, Norfolk worked towards reviving its urban core: Granby Street To compete with suburban shopping destinations, Norfolk city leaders tried to create a similar mall experience on Granby Street. The city rebranded its commercial core the \\"Granby Street Mall\\", closed Granby Street to through- traffic and created a pedestrian mall. The Granby Street Mall did not succeed and the mall endured hardship through the late 1970s and early 1980s. Waterfront developments Waterside Another focus was the waterfront and its decaying piers and warehouses. Norfolk, using Federal urban renewal funds, began large-scale demolitions downtown. This included slum housing that, in the mid-20th century, did not have indoor plumbing or access to running water. The former City Market, Norfolk Terminal Station (the Union railroad station) and The Monticello Hotel were also demolished. At the water's edge, nearly all of the obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished and replaced with a new boulevard, Waterside Drive. Among the buildings erected were the * Waterside Festival Marketplace, an indoor mall similar to Baltimore's Inner Harbor Pavilions * Waterfront Town Point Park, an esplanade park with wide open riverfront views * Norfolk Omni Hotel. On the inland side of Waterside Drive, the demolition of the warehouses and wharves made way for high rise buildings. Nauticus MacArthur Center In the mid 1990s, Norfolk again attempted to rejuvenate Granby Street, which continued to lag behind the waterfront in terms of revitalization. In late 1996, it was announced that a new downtown shopping mall would be built, in which Nordstrom would to open a store. The mall was named the MacArthur Center, in honor of the five-star World War II General whose tomb was located across the street from the proposed site. Nearly $100 million dollars in public funds was committed to infrastructure improvements and construction of parking garages to support the shopping mall. The MacArthur Center opened in March 1999 as a three-story enclosed shopping mall with an 18-screen stadium seating movie theater. Other developments The residential population of downtown continues to grow as commercial buildings are converted into residences and new residential developments are built.

Afrodisio Aguado) Fiesta al noroeste is a novel written by Ana Maria Matute and first published in 1952.  Summary  Dingo is a puppeteer who is travelling when he runs over a small child with his cart. He then goes to Artámila in order to find Juan Medinao, a prominent land-owner and childhood companion, and find the child's family. Juan is really rich, and when Dingo arrives a servant comes to get Juan. Then, there is a flashback of the childhood of Juan, when his father, aka Juan Padre, was abusive to him and had an affair with Salomé, a woman in the town. Salomé had Juan Padre's second child, Pablo Zacaro. Juan's mother died as a result of Juan Padre's actions towards her, and after her death, Juan Padre sent Juan away to boarding school because Juan reminds him of his mother. However, Juan wants to know his brother, so he returns home to Artámila. Then, the story returns to the present, where a priest and doctor have joined Juan and Dingo at the dead child's house. The doctor is always drunk (emborrachado). Then, Juan confesses to the priest that his whole life he has been prideful. The rest of the book is his confession (as a flashback). Although Juan was an awkward child with a large head, he and Dingo were friends. They became friends when they realized that both of their dads beat them. Pablo, on the other hand, was a stone-fox. Juan Padre was really rich, and when he died, he gave all his money and land to Juan. At one point, Dingo brings Juan to a puppet show in the town, and it scares Juan, but Dingo runs away with the puppet cart. Pablo feels every man should construct his own house, but Juan owns all the land and refuses to let Pablo build there. The servants unite around Pablo against Juan, and Pablo runs away. After Pablo runs away, Juan realizes that he wants everyone to know that they are brothers, so he asks Salome where Pablo went. Unfortunately, Salomé doesn't know, but Pablo returns to the town with a girlfriend Delia, a peasant woman. Juan goes to Delia's family and asks for her hand in marriage, but she doesn't want to marry him. However, her family forces her to marry Juan so that she won't have to work anymore. After this, Pablo hates Juan and never wants to be with him. He also rejects Delia. The flashback ends here and Juan's confession is over. The last chapter of the book is the dead child's funeral.  Themes  The main theme is pride. Juan's pride prohibited his happiness. At the end of the novel, Juan Medinao wanted to be with his brother, but because he told Pablo that he couldn't build a house on his land, their relationship is ruined. Pride also affected Pablo because he was too prideful to accept Delia after her marriage to Juan.

As the occasionally used common name goliath catfishes indicates, this genus includes some of the largest species of catfish, including the piraíba, B. filamentosum, which reaches up to the region of in length. Brachyplatystoma are found in the Amazon and Orinoco basins, and other tropical freshwater and brackish habitats in South America. Some species are migratory. These fish are important as food fish and, to some extent, aquarium fish. Taxonomy Brachyplatystoma originates from Greek brachys, platys, and stoma, which mean short, flat, and mouth respectively. This genus was described in 1862 by Pieter Bleeker. The type species is B. vaillantii. The subgenus Malacobagrus is applied to B. capapretum, B. filamentosum, B. rousseauxii, and the extinct species B. promagdalena, which only is known from fossil remains. Brachyplatystoma and its monotypic sister group Platynematichthys are the only genera in the tribe Brachyplatystomatini. These two genera are characterized by two synapomorphies; these include a gas bladder divided into an anterior portion and a triangular posterior portion, as well as a ventral crest under the cleithrum, the main bone supporting the pectoral fins. The genus Brachyplatystoma was previously not monophyletic; to correct this, the genera Merodontotus and Goslinia are now both included under Brachyplatysoma. Furthermore, a new species was described in 2005, which brings the species count to seven extant species. B. capapretum is sister to B. filamentosum. B. flavicans is not actually a species of Brachyplatystoma; this name is a commonly used synonym of Zungaro zungaro. Anatomy and appearance Brachyplatystoma all exhibit long maxillary barbels that extend past the dorsal fin in all species, but may even extend to the caudal fin. The caudal fin of adult Brachyplatystoma fish is moderately to deeply forked. Brachyplatystoma have specialized pelagic young with greatly elongated barbels and fin filaments, and strongly ornamented pectoral spines. This genus is characterized by two synapomorphies. One of these is modified jaw muscles. The other, more obvious trait, is only found in juveniles and subadults, in which the upper and lower rays of the caudal fin are extended into long filaments. B. vaillantii is the sister species to all other Brachyplatystoma, marked by differences in the skull, jaw, and other bones. The subgenus Malacobagrus is characterized by their derived lateral line, Weberian apparatus, a subquadrangular gill cover (as opposed to triangular in other species), and pectoral spine. As mentioned, one of the characteristics of this genus is caudal fin filaments on younger fish. In most of the species these filaments are lost in adulthood, though they are retained in B. tigrinum, B. juruense, and B. platynemum. Many Brachyplatystoma exhibit countershading, in which the dorsal surface is darker, and then fades to a lighter belly. In most species, this is consistent throughout life, though there are some exceptions. Juvenile B. capapretum and B. filamentosum exhibit dorsal and lateral spots which mostly disappear in the adult form. Juvenile B. juruense and B. tigrinum exhibit lateral spots that expand to form vertical stripes as the fish matures. B. capapretum, described in 2005, was previously misidentified as B. filamentosum. These two species are closely related. However, these species differ in premaxillary dentition, juvenile and adult coloration, and adult maxillary barbel length and caudal fin shape. These two species exhibit spotted juvenile stages, though in B. capapretum these spots are much larger than the eye, while in B. filamentosum these spots are about the same size as the eye. Also, the cross section of the caudal peduncle is rounded in these two species, as opposed to a deeper, thinner cross section in other Brachyplatystoma species. The adult B. capapretum has a very dark or even black dorsum (its species name is derived from Portuguese which means black cape), as opposed to the lighter dorsal surface of B. filamentosum. Brachyplatystoma includes some of the largest species of Amazonian catfish, including the Piraíba, B. filamentosum, which reaches up to about in length and in weight. Even the most modest species reach about . The other species range in size from about . B. filamentosum and B. rousseauxii have a mysterious \\"milk\\" gland at the anterior upper part of its pectoral fins. Its function is unknown, but in Colombia this fish is known as lechero, which means milkman. The world record recognized by IGFA for Brachyplatystoma filamentosum belongs to the Brazilian, Jorge Masullo de Aguiar with 155 kg. juvenile Brachyplatystoma sp Distribution and habitat Fish of this genus are found in the Amazon, Orinoco, and The Guyanas in South America. The genus does not occur west or north of the Andes or in the Venezuelan Coastal Range. These fish generally inhabit areas that have a soft substrate, such as mud or sand. The fossil catfish B. promagdalena has been found in Colombia in an area now drained by the Magdalena River, where Brachyplatystoma species are currently absent; during the Miocene, this area had been drained by the Amazon and Orinoco system. Ecology These fish are mainly piscivorous. Stomach contents of B. filamentosum have been claimed to sometimes contain monkeys and it may even prey on humans. Some of the species of Brachyplatystoma migrate long distances for reproduction. This is known in B. vaillantii, B. platynemum, and B. rousseauxii, but data about the migratory habits of other species are scant. This migration is associated with white-water rivers, as black water does not contain enough food for migrating Pimelodids. Maturation is timed to the increase in river level. Migration begins as the river level begins to rise with the coming of the rainy season. B. rousseauxii has the longest reproductive migration of any freshwater fish; from the mouth of the Amazon, migration may stretch , a trip which may last five to six months, before they spawn in the western tributaries of the Amazon. It is hypothesized that B. rousseauxii is homing, that is, it will return to the tributary in which it was born. Before spawning, the stomachs of these fish are empty, due to high digestive efficiency. The young are carried downstream until they reach estuaries. Juveniles and subadults are commonly found in these habitats. They may even live in brackish waters at this time. They will live in these estuaries and river mouths for about three years here before entering the lower reaches of the river. At this still immature stage, they may form groups or school. This is the first record of young, migratory fish in the Amazon basin. Relationship to humans Brachyplatystoma are important food fish. In the Amazon Basin, thousands of metric tons of fish from this genus are caught for both local consumption as well as exportation. These fish are usually caught with the use of longlines or drift nets. They are also captured by harpoon as well as ropes with large fish hooks at the end. B. filamentosum is a major fishery, and B. rousseauxii has become the most important species in the Amazon River basin. B. rousseauxii and B. vaillantii constitute a significant percentage of Amazonian food fish. Based on a review by IBAMA, B. vaillantii was by far the most caught fish by weight in the Brazilian Amazon in 1998, B. rousseauxii the fourth most caught and B. filamentosum the sixth (Semaprochilodus spp. second, Prochilodus nigricans third and Brycon spp. fifth).Araujo-Lima, C.A.R.M.; and M.L. Ruffino (2003). Migratory Fishes of the Brazilian Amazon. Pp. 233—302 in: Carolsfeld, J.; B. Harvey; C. Ross; and A. Baer (editors). Migratory Fishes of South America. The flesh of Brachyplatystoma is considered to be of excellent quality. Human activities are a concern in that they may disrupt these fishes. Dams may impede the migration of these fish both to and from their spawning sites. Gold prospecting may also frighten these large catfishes in the areas where they spawn. Deforestation can also affect the upriver spawning habitats. Because these fish may migrate back to their original tributary, overfishing in a certain area may reduce a whole genetic group. In some areas, catches have been diminishing due to overfishing. B. rousseauxii is known to be overfished, and this same situation may apply to other Brachyplatystoma. Catch rates of B. filamentosum have decreased drastically from 1977. Conversely, there have been recorded incidents where large B. filamentosum have preyed on humans. In one account documented on the television series River Monsters, a local fisherman was found having been swallowed head-first up to his waist by one of these catfish, though neither the fish nor the fisherman survived the encounter. In the aquarium Brachyplatystoma are generally uncommon in the fishkeeping trade. The large size of many of these fish prohibit them from being maintained in anything but the largest of aquaria, or in public aquariums. B. tigrinum is a highly prized fish in the fishkeeping hobby, and is one of the most expensive fish in this family. These fish should be kept in well- oxygenated aquarium with a high current. Due to their large size, the aquarium should also be spacious and any tankmates must be large enough not to be eaten. The aquarium should not be brightly lit, and hiding places should be available. Breeding is unreported in captivity. Due to the similarity between B. tigrinum and B. juruense, the latter is often known as the False Zebra Shovelnose or False Tigrinus (as B. tigrinum was previously known as Merodontotus tigrinus). Species There are currently seven recognized species in this genus (common name shown in second parentheses): *Subgenus Brachyplatystoma:  Brachyplatystoma juruense (Boulenger, 1898) (Zebra catfish, Juruense catfish, Gold Zebra Pim, False Tigrinus)  Brachyplatystoma platynemum Boulenger, 1898 (Slobbering catfish)  Brachyplatystoma tigrinum (Britski, 1981) (Tigerstriped catfish, Zebra shovelnose, Royal tiger shovelnose)  Brachyplatystoma vaillantii (Valenciennes, 1840) (Laulao catfish, Piramutaba) * Subgenus Malacobagrus  Brachyplatystoma capapretum Lundberg & Akama, 2005  Brachyplatystoma filamentosum (Lichtenstein, 1819) (Kumakuma, Piraíba, Filhote)  Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii (Castelnau, 1855) (Gilded Catfish, Dourada (litt. golden in Portuguese.

Tradition states that she was noble; she may have been related to the Roman Emperor.

Book of Saints, 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 17 August 2016. Wishing to escape a marriage arranged by Constans II and become a nun, she went to Rome. There she received the veil from Pope Liberius. Upon the death of her father, she returned to Constantinople and, renouncing any claim to the imperial crown, distributed her wealth to the poor. She then planned to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. However, a terrible storm shipwrecked her on the shores of Naples. Finding refuge on the tiny island of Megarides (the site of the present-day Castel dell'Ovo), the site of a small hermitage, Patricia died shortly after from disease. Veneration The monastery of Sante Patricia contained her relics. During the turbulent events of 1864, they were translated to the monastery of San Gregorio Armeno. Covered in wax, her relics were contained in an urn of gold, gems, and silver, and were placed in the monastery’s chapel. The monastery also preserves her blood.Urbs Sanguinum - Santa Patrizia Her blood, like that of Januarius, the other, more famous patron saint of Naples, is also said to liquefy periodically. The associated legend states that after Patricia died, a zealous man pulled out one of her teeth, causing the body to hemorrhage. Patricia's followers collected the blood and exposed it. It then liquefied.

It runs from Maryland Route 454 (MD 454) at the Maryland border in Marydel east to an intersection with DE 9 north of Little Creek. The route passes through rural areas of western Kent County before heading through Delaware's capital city, Dover, on Forrest Avenue and Division Street. East of Dover, the road passes through more rural areas. DE 8 intersects DE 44 in Pearsons Corner; DE 15, U.S. Route 13 Alternate (US 13 Alt.), and US 13 in Dover; and DE 1 at a partial interchange east of Dover. The road was built as a state highway west of Dover by 1924 and east of Dover by 1931. The DE 8 designation was given to the road by 1936. Route description DE 8 begins at the Maryland border in Marydel, where the road continues into the town of Marydel, Maryland as MD 454\\\\. From the state line, the route heads southeast on two-lane undivided Halltown Road, passing a few homes and businesses. The road leaves Marydel and curves northeast through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. In Pearsons Corner, DE 8 intersects the eastern terminus of DE 44, where it turns to the east past businesses and the name changes to Forrest Avenue upon crossing Pearsons Corner Road. From here, the route runs through more rural areas with some development. This area of Kent County is home to many Amish farms, homes, and businesses. DE 8 eastbound in the western part of Dover DE 8 crosses into the city of Dover, where it passes to the north of Dover High School before it widens from a two-lane road to a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The road runs past homes and businesses in the western part of Dover, intersecting Kenton Road and DE 15\\\\. The name changes to Forest Street upon crossing DE 15 and the route continues east onto West Division Street at the point Forest Street splits to the southeast to lead to Loockerman Street and downtown Dover. At this point, DE 8 narrows to a two-lane road. The route crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade and continues past a mix of homes and businesses to the north of downtown area. The road crosses US 13 Alt. and passes to the south of Wesley College before intersecting State Street, where the name becomes East Division Street. The route comes to a junction with Kings Highway SW north of the Delaware Governor's Mansion and the name changes to Kings Highway NE. DE 8 crosses the St. Jones River and Kings Highway NE splits to the north, with DE 8 once again becoming East Division Street. The road heads between businesses to the north and residential neighborhoods to the south, widening to four lanes. DE 8 intersects US 13 in a commercial area and continues through the residential eastern part of Dover as a two-lane road. The name changes to North Little Creek Road and the route heads through less dense areas of homes with some farmland. At the eastern edge of the city, the roadway features a partial interchange with the DE 1 toll road, providing access to northbound DE 1 and from southbound DE 1\\\\. After this interchange, the road leaves Dover and continues east through open agricultural areas, crossing the Little River. DE 8 reaches its eastern terminus at an intersection with DE 9 just north of the town of Little Creek. The section of the route between DE 1 east of Dover and DE 9 north of Little Creek is designated as a spur of the Delaware's Bayshore Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE 8 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 21,663 vehicles at the DE 15 intersection to a low of 858 vehicles at the Little Creek border near the eastern terminus. The portion of DE 8 between DE 44 and DE 15 is part of the National Highway System. History DE 8 eastbound past the eastern terminus of DE 44 in Pearsons Corner By 1920, what is now DE 8 existed as an unimproved county road. The route was completed as a state highway between the Maryland border in Marydel and Dover by 1924. By 1925, the road was proposed as a state highway between Dover and Little Creek. This state highway was completed by 1931. DE 8 was assigned to its current alignment between the Maryland border in Marydel and DE 9 north of Little Creek by 1936. On September 5, 2002, a partial interchange opened at the DE 1 toll road in Dover, utilizing existing emergency vehicle ramps. This interchange was included in the initial plans for the highway but was dropped due to low traffic volumes. As part of building the interchange, the Delaware Department of Transportation purchased development rights to adjacent land parcels in order to prevent additional development in the area of the interchange. In 2012, the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance pushed for the city of Dover to rename the Division Street portion of DE 8 to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard after civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. However, local merchants opposed the renaming. The Dover city council instead voted to rename Court Street, Duke of York Street, and William Penn Street near Delaware Legislative Hall to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

Description  Meesia triqueta grows in small tufts or cushions. The plants, often large, are acrocarpous and dioicous. In color they are dark-green to grass-green above, occasionally red- brown below due to dense rhizoids. The plant's stems are not branched or little branched, pale-brown to yellow-brown, closely foliate, and 2–14 cm high. Its leaves are decurrent, squarrose (spreading) when moist, triangular to ovate to lanceolate, somewhat crispate (contorted), 2–3½ mm long, and tristichous (in three obvious ranks). The leaf margins are sharply serrate or denticulate to the base or nearly so, plane or sometimes recurved in the middle of the leaf. The costa is relatively narrow (less than 1/5 the width of the leaf base), subpercurrent to percurrent, gradually tapering at distal end. The leaf's apex is acute to acuminate (sharply pointed). The lamina is unistratose throughout. The perigonia of Meesia triqueta' are terminal in discoid heads. The seta is straight and smooth, brown to yellow-brown, and very long (4–10 cm). The capsule is asymmetrical, somewhat pyriform, 2¾–5½ mm long including the neck; the hypophysis (neck) is long (comprising up to ½ of capsule length), moderately well-defined, not much wrinkled when dry; the urn is oblong to short-cylindric, arcuate and asymmetric, brown to yellow-brown, up to 4 mm long, and when dry, wrinkled but not regularly sulcate. The operculum is short-conic; the endostome cilia are often rather well-developed. The plant's spores are finely papillose. Meersia triquetra is easily recognized by its distinct three-ranked leaf arrangement and for being dioicous. It may be distinguished from M. uliginosa by its squarrose leaves; narrow costa relative to the size of the leaf base; serrate, planar leaf margins; and acute leaf tips. In contrast, M. uliginosa a wide (up to 1/3 of the leaf base) costa, entire, revolute leaf margins, and blunt apices. Other Meesia species also have blunt apices.  Distribution and habitat  This species has a circumboreal distribution: it is found in Northern Europe, northern Asia, Greenland, Canada, and the northern United States, Some discoveries have been reported from Oceania. These mosses occur in wetland sites, specifically, within wet woods in the wettest portions of what are called \\"extreme rich fens\\" (i.e., fens having surface waters with high pH and calcium concentrations). Montagnes describes this species as a \\"rich fen indicator of high fidelity.\\" Associates include Scorpidium spp. and Drepanocladus revolvens. The fire ecology of this plant is not known; however, fens rarely burn. Excess soot from a nearby fire, however, might negatively affect habitat quality. Fire return intervals in conifer bogs, a somewhat similar mire-type habitat, are estimated to be about once every 150–200 years. Fire does significant damage to peat, but the bog must be dry (as during a drought year) in order to burn; typically, bogs are not dry enough.  Conservation status and threats  U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region Sensitive Species. California Native Plant Society List 4.2 NatureServe California State Rank: S2.2; Global Rank: G5 Fens are delicate habitats susceptible to impacts from livestock grazing, hydrologic alteration, construction and continued use of roads, and peat mining.

Biography Queen Therese of Bavaria by Joseph Karl Stieler Therese was a daughter of Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, and Duchess Charlotte Georgine of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, eldest daughter of Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. In 1809, she was on the list of possible brides for Napoleon, but on 12 October 1810 married the Bavarian crown prince Ludwig. Their wedding was the occasion of the first ever Oktoberfest. She became queen in 1825. During the numerous love affairs of her husband, Therese suffered but tolerated the situation. She did not refrain, however, from demonstrating her disapproval in discreet ways; in 1831, she left town during one of his affairs, and she strictly rejected associating with the mistresses. Therese often assisted with the administration of the kingdom of Bavaria, especially when Ludwig was absent from Munich during his numerous journeys, and she did have some political influence and participated in political issues. She was very popular and was considered to embody an ideal image of queen, wife and mother. She was involved in a great number of charitable organizations for widows, orphans and the poor. She was the object of great sympathy during her husband's infidelity with Lola Montez, which caused him to abdicate in 1848. Children Therese and Ludwig had nine children: * Maximilian (1811–1864), who married Princess Marie of Prussia (1825–1889); King of Bavaria as Maximilian II from 1848 to 1864. * Mathilde Caroline (1813–1862), who married Ludwig III, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine (1806–1877). * Otto (1815–1867), who married Duchess Amalie of Oldenburg (1818–1875); King of Greece as Otto I from 1832 to 1862. * Theodelinde (1816–1817). * Luitpold (1821–1912), who married Archduchess Auguste of Austria (1825–1864); Prince Regent of Bavaria (1886–1912). * Adelgunde (1823–1914), who married Francis V, Duke of Modena (1819–1875). * Hildegard (1825–1864), who married Archduke Albert of Austria (1817–1895) Duke of Teschen. * Alexandra (1826–1875). * Adalbert (1828–1875), who married Infanta Amalia of Spain (1834–1905).

Motivation and statement of theorem If we have a holomorphic function f defined on the open unit disk \\\\mathbb{D}=\\\\\\\\{z:z<1\\\\\\\\}, it is reasonable to ask under what conditions we can extend this function to the boundary of the unit disk. To do this, we can look at what the function looks like on each circle inside the disk centered at 0, each with some radius r. This defines a new function: :\\\\begin{cases} f_{r}:S^{1}\\\\to \\\\Complex  f_{r}(e^{i\\\\theta})=f(re^{i\\\\theta}) \\\\end{cases} where :S^{1}:=\\\\\\\\{e^{i\\\\theta}:\\\\theta\\\\in[0,2\\\\pi]\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{z\\\\in \\\\Complex:z=1\\\\\\\\}, is the unit circle. Then it would be expected that the values of the extension of f onto the circle should be the limit of these functions, and so the question reduces to determining when f_{r} converges, and in what sense, as r\\\\to 1, and how well defined is this limit. In particular, if the L^p norms of these f_{r} are well behaved, we have an answer: :Theorem. Let f:\\\\mathbb{D}\\\\to\\\\Complex be a holomorphic function such that :: \\\\sup_{0 :where f_r are defined as above. Then f_{r} converges to some function f_{1}\\\\in L^{p}(S^{1}) pointwise almost everywhere and in L^{p} norm. That is, ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\left f_{r}(e^{i\\\\theta})-f_{1}(e^{i\\\\theta}) \\\\right  &\\\\to 0 && \\\\text{for almost every } \\\\theta\\\\in [0,2\\\\pi]  \\\\left \\\\ f_{r}-f_{1} \\\\right \\\\_{L^{p}(S^{1})} &\\\\to 0 \\\\end{align} Now, notice that this pointwise limit is a radial limit. That is, the limit being taken is along a straight line from the center of the disk to the boundary of the circle, and the statement above hence says that : f(re^{i\\\\theta})\\\\to f_{1}(e^{i\\\\theta}) \\\\qquad \\\\text{for almost every } \\\\theta. The natural question is, with this boundary function defined, will we converge pointwise to this function by taking a limit in any other way? That is, suppose instead of following a straight line to the boundary, we follow an arbitrary curve \\\\gamma:[0,1)\\\\to \\\\mathbb{D} converging to some point e^{i\\\\theta} on the boundary. Will f converge to f_{1}(e^{i\\\\theta})? (Note that the above theorem is just the special case of \\\\gamma(t)=te^{i\\\\theta}). It turns out that the curve \\\\gamma needs to be non- tangential, meaning that the curve does not approach its target on the boundary in a way that makes it tangent to the boundary of the circle. In other words, the range of \\\\gamma must be contained in a wedge emanating from the limit point. We summarize as follows: Definition. Let \\\\gamma:[0,1)\\\\to \\\\mathbb{D} be a continuous path such that \\\\lim olimits_{t\\\\to 1}\\\\gamma(t)=e^{i\\\\theta}\\\\in S^{1}. Define : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Gamma_{\\\\alpha}&=\\\\\\\\{z:\\\\arg z\\\\in [\\\\pi-\\\\alpha,\\\\pi+\\\\alpha]\\\\\\\\}  \\\\Gamma_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\theta) &=\\\\mathbb{D}\\\\cap e^{i\\\\theta}(\\\\Gamma_{\\\\alpha}+1) \\\\end{align} That is, \\\\Gamma_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\theta) is the wedge inside the disk with angle 2\\\\alpha whose axis passes between e^{i\\\\theta} and zero. We say that \\\\gamma converges non-tangentially to e^{i\\\\theta}, or that it is a non- tangential limit, if there exists 0<\\\\alpha<\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{2} such that \\\\gamma is contained in \\\\Gamma_{\\\\alpha} and \\\\lim olimits_{t\\\\to 1}\\\\gamma(t)=e^{i\\\\theta}. :Fatou's Theorem. Let f\\\\in H^{p}(\\\\mathbb{D}). Then for almost all \\\\theta\\\\in[0,2\\\\pi], ::\\\\lim_{t\\\\to 1}f(\\\\gamma(t))=f_{1}(e^{i\\\\theta}) :for every non-tangential limit \\\\gamma converging to e^{i\\\\theta}, where f_{1} is defined as above.

Eight Israeli civilians were killed in the attack and 55 additional people were injured. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, as did Islamic Jihad. The Afula bus suicide bombing was the first suicide bombing attack to be carried out by Palestinian militants against Israeli civilians in Israel, and was carried out in retaliation for the killing by a settler of 29 Muslims while they were at prayer in the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron on February 25.  Preparations for the attack  Opel Ascona C, similar to the 1987 Opel Ascona C used to carry out the attack The Afula bus suicide bombing attack was planned by Hamas chief bombmaker Yahya Ayyash, who began to plan suicide bombings within Israel in 1992. Ayyash rigged a 1987 Opel Ascona with seven gas cylinders, five anti-personnel hand grenades, and wrapped the bomb in a rucksack containing 1,100 carpenter nails. A caller to a Western news agency in Jerusalem said the car was carrying 385 pounds of explosives. The car, which had Israeli license plates that did not belong to it, had been stolen in Tel Aviv on March 23.  The attack  The memorial built at the site of the attack in memory of the victims of the attack Around 12:10 pm, during the Holocaust Memorial Day, a Palestinian suicide bomber drove a vehicle full of explosives into the division nine street in downtown Afula. Two nearby schools had just ended classes for the day, and young Jewish students streamed toward the approaching bus for home. The suicide bomber stopped his vehicle next to an Egged commuter bus line number 348 and detonated the explosives device as the bus was boarding passengers at the bus stop, which was crowded with people. Witnesses described a horrible scene. A firefighter who was the first on the scene said that the street was covered with oil, seared metal and nails. A 23-year-old survivor who had been reading a newspaper about the on-going Oslo peace negotiations saw \\"a big rolling fire.\\" He ran away, ripping off his burning clothes as he went. An ambulance driver reported that \\"people were charred, lacking limbs, lacking heads... .\\" Tree branches were ripped off and windows were shattered at a nearby kindergarten.

As a group of Israeli students boarded the bus, Zaqarna detonated the bomb.Katz, 106 Israeli media reports said that he had previously served time in prison and was on an Israeli army list of fugitive members of Hamas's extremist armed wing. Police said they found a banner denouncing the Oslo peace process, and a Koran, the Islamic holy book, near the debris of the car. Motivation Hamas publicly declared that the attack was one of 5 planned to retaliate for the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre in which the Hebron settler Baruch Goldstein machine-gunned 29 Muslims at prayer and wounded a further 125. Hamas, after conducting a second attack on April 13, the Hadera bus station suicide bombing, Hamas desisted from undertaking the other three it had planned, when Israel quickened its schedule for withdrawing its military from the Gaza Strip soon after.Robert Pape Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism, Random House 2005 pp.66-68 However, the Hebron attack may have been an excuse, not a reason. Hamas, whose charter calls for the destruction of Israel, opposed the Oslo peace talks, which were underway in Cairo at that time.

It runs from Maryland Route 287 (MD 287) at the Maryland border in Sandtown east to an interchange with DE 1 at the North Gate of Dover Air Force Base in the southeastern part of the city of Dover. The route passes through the towns of Camden and Wyoming along the way. From the Maryland border to Camden, it is a two-lane undivided road that passes through rural areas. DE 10 is a four-lane divided highway called Lebanon Road between U.S. Route 13 (US 13) in Camden and DE 1\\\\. DE 10 has one alternate route, DE 10 Alternate (DE 10 Alt.), which provides an alternate alignment between Willow Grove and Highland Acres, passing through Woodside and Rising Sun. What is now DE 10 between the Maryland border and Camden was constructed as a state highway in stages in the 1920s and early 1930s. The route was first designated by 1936 to follow its current alignment between the Maryland border and Camden and current Rising Sun Road to US 113 Alt. in Rising Sun. By 1969, DE 10 was rerouted to follow Lebanon Road, a road completed by 1966, to US 113 (now DE 1) at Dover Air Force Base. Lebanon Road was improved into a divided highway by 1981. Route description DE 10 westbound past DE 10 Alt. in Highland Acres DE 10 begins at the Maryland border west of Sandtown, where the road continues west into that state as MD 287\\\\. From the state line the route heads east on two-lane undivided Willow Grove Road through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. DE 10 passes through Sandtown, where it intersects Sandtown Road. The road curves northeast and runs through Petersburg before coming to an intersection with the western terminus of DE 10 Alt. DE 10 passes to the southeast of the community of Willow Grove and continues northeast. The route heads through rural areas with increasing residential development and intersects DE 15 at a roundabout before crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade. The road continues northeast into the town of Camden and passes homes along with some businesses, becoming Caesar Rodney Avenue at the South Street intersection. DE 10 forms the border between the town of Wyoming to the west and Camden to the east and curves north before turning east onto Camden Wyoming Avenue and fully entering Camden. The route continues through residential areas, passing north of the Camden Friends Meetinghouse and crossing US 13 Alt. in the center of town. On the eastern edge of Camden, the road comes to an intersection with US 13. Past the intersection with US 13, DE 10 becomes West Lebanon Road, a four-lane divided highway, and intersects Rising Sun Road. The road heads east-northeast and passes through areas of suburban residential development to the south of the city of Dover in Highland Acres. The route comes to an intersection with South State Street, where DE 10 Alt. returns to the route. DE 10 becomes East Lebanon Road and runs east through a mix of residential and commercial development, curving to the northeast. The road crosses the St. Jones River and reaches an interchange with access to and from the southbound direction the DE 1 freeway. DE 10 comes to its eastern terminus within this interchange at an intersection with Bay Road at the North Gate of Dover Air Force Base. Bay Road heads north to provide access to and from the northbound direction of DE 1. The portion of the route between the Maryland border and US 13 Alt. in Camden and between DE 10 Alt. and Gateway South Boulevard near Lebanon is part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE 10 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 23,644 vehicles at the eastern terminus at Bay Road to a low of 2,774 vehicles at the Sandtown Road intersection. None of DE 10 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920 what is now DE 10 existed as an unimproved county road. The portion of the current route through Camden, as well as the road between Camden and Rising Sun, was upgraded to a state highway by 1924. By 1925 the road was completed as a state highway between Willow Grove and Camden, while the portion between the Maryland border near Sandtown and Willow Grove was under proposal as a state highway. The portion of road west of Willow Grove became a state highway by 1931. DE 10 was assigned to run from the Maryland border near Sandtown to US 113 Alt. (South State Street) in Rising Sun by 1936, following its current alignment between the Maryland border and Camden and Rising Sun Road between Camden and Rising Sun. By 1964, the route was realigned to bypass Willow Grove to the southeast, with the former alignment now Willow Tree Circle. The Lebanon Road portion of DE 10 was constructed by 1966, connecting the route east of Camden to US 113 (Bay Road) at Dover Air Force Base. DE 10 was rerouted to follow Lebanon Road to US 113 by 1969. The Lebanon Road portion of the route between US 13 and US 113 was completely widened into a divided highway by 1981. In 1993, the DE 1 freeway was completed in the area of the eastern terminus, with an interchange to that road built that incorporated ramps to both DE 10 and the existing US 113, which merged with DE 1 at this point. The US 113 designation was removed from the area in 2004, leaving DE 10 terminating only with DE 1. On June 5, 2017, construction began for a roundabout at the junction with DE 15 west of Camden in order to improve safety at the intersection. The roundabout was completed by September 2017. There are plans to build a bypass of the section of DE 10 through Camden in order to improve safety and reduce congestion on the alignment through the town. The bypass is proposed to run to the south of Camden, running from DE 10 at the western end of Camden east to a roundabout with DE 10 and Rising Sun Road east of the town. Construction of the bypass is planned to begin in 2023 and be completed in 2025. Major intersections Delaware Route 10 Alternate Delaware Route 10 Alternate (DE 10 Alt.) is an alternate route of DE 10 between Willow Grove and Highland Acres. The route heads east from DE 10 on two-lane undivided Henry Cowgill Road, passing through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes and crossing Tidbury Creek. DE 10 Alt. reaches the town of Woodside and intersects DE 15, with that route becoming concurrent with DE 10 Alt. on Main Street. The road crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade and becomes lined with homes. At an intersection with US 13 Alt., DE 15 splits from DE 10 Alt. by heading south of US 13 Alt. DE 10 Alt. becomes Walnut Shade Road and leaves Woodside, coming to an intersection with US 13\\\\. Past this intersection the route passes to the south of Polytech High School and enters a mix of farms, woods, and residential development to the north of Woodside East, curving to the northeast and reaching an intersection with Peachtree Run before heading north-northeast. DE 10 Alt. reaches the community of Rising Sun, turning northeast onto Sorghum Mill Road at the Voshells Mill Star Hill Road/Rising Sun Road intersection before making a turn to the north onto South State Street. The route passes through woods, crossing Tidbury Creek, and runs through residential development before ending at another intersection with DE 10, with South State Street continuing north toward Dover. The portion of the route between Voshells Mill Star Hill Road/Rising Sun Road and South State Street/Sorghum Mill Road in Rising Sun is part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, a Delaware Byway.

Three bands of Utes comprise the Ute Indian Tribe: the Whiteriver Band, the Uncompahgre Band and the Uintah Band. The Tribe has a membership of more than three thousand individuals, with over half living on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. The Ute Indian Tribe operates its own tribal government and oversees approximately 1.3 million acres of trust land which contains significant oil and gas deposits. Historic bands The Northern Ute tribe, which was moved to the Uintah Ouray Reservation, is composed of a number of bands. The tribes at the reservation include the following groups: * Uintah tribe, which is larger than its historical band since the U.S. government classified the following bands as Uintah when they were relocated to the reservation: :* The San Pitch Utes of central Utah lived in the Sanpete Valley, Sevier River Valley, and along the San Pitch River. :* Uintah lived in northeastern Utah from Utah Lake to the Uintah Basin of the Tavaputs Plateau near the Grand-Colorado River-system. :* The Timpanogos lived in the Wasatch Range around Mount Timpanogos, along the southern and eastern shores of Utah Lake of the Utah Valley, and in Heber Valley, Uinta Basin and Sanpete Valley. :* The Seuvarits band was from the Moab area. * White River Utes :* The Yampa from the Yampa River Valley area and the Parianuche, who lived in the Colorado River valley (previously called the Grand River) of western Colorado and eastern Utah. The two bands are now called the White River Utes. The Sabuagana were of the same relative area as the Parianuche. * The Tabeguache, also called the Uncompahgre, lived in the Gunnison and Uncompahgre River valleys of Colorado and Utah. History Utes have lived in the Great Basin region for over 10,000 years. From 3000 BCE to around 500 BCE, they lived along the Gila River in Arizona. People of the Fremont culture lived to the north in western Colorado, but when drought struck in the 13th century, they joined the Utes in San Luis Valley, Colorado. Utes were one of the first tribes to obtain horses from escaped Spanish stock. Spanish explorers traveled through Ute land in 1776. They were followed by an ever-increasing number of non-Natives. The Colorado Gold Rush of the 1850s flooded Ute lands with prospectors. Mormons fought the Utes from the 1840s to 1870s. In the 1860s the US federal government created the Uintah Reservation. Utah Utes, including the Timpanogos or Timpanog tribe from Central Utah, settled there in 1864, and were joined in 1882 by eight bands of Northern Utes. The US government tried to force the Utes to farm, despite the lack of water and unfavorable growing conditions on their reservation. Irrigation projects of the early 20th century put water in non-tribal hands. Ute children were forced to attend Indian boarding schools in the 1880s and half of the Ute children at the Albuquerque Indian School died.Pritzker, 243 Government The Tribal Business Committee is the governing council of the Tribe and is located in Fort Duchesne, Utah. Reservation The Uinta and Ouray Indian Reservation is the second-largest Indian Reservation in the US – covering over of land. Tribal owned lands only cover approximately of surface land and of mineral-owned land within the reservation area. Founded in 1861, it is located in Carbon, Duchesne, Grand, Uintah, Utah, and Wasatch Counties in Utah. Raising stock and oil and gas leases are important revenue streams for the reservation. The tribe is a member of the Council of Energy Resource Tribes. Language The Ute language is a Proto-Numic language within the Uto-Aztecan language family.Pritzker, 242 The language is still widely spoken. In 1984, the tribe declared the Ute language to be the official language of their reservation, and the Ute Language, Culture and Traditions Committee provides language education materials.\\"Ute Language Policy.\\" Cultural Survival.

It runs from Maryland Route 314 (MD 314) at the Maryland border in Whiteleysburg east to an interchange with DE 1 near Frederica. The route follows a mostly rural alignment, passing through the towns of Felton and Frederica. DE 12 intersects U.S. Route 13 (US 13) in Felton and DE 15 east of Felton. What would become DE 12 was built as a state highway during the 1920s. DE 12 was designated between Felton and Frederica by 1936 and extended west to the Maryland border by 1938. The eastern terminus was moved to its current location in 1965 when US 113 (now DE 1) was routed to bypass Frederica. The DE 1 intersection became an interchange in 2011. Route description DE 12 eastbound past US 13 in Felton DE 12 begins at the Maryland border in the community of Whiteleysburg, with the road continuing west into that state as MD 314\\\\. From the state line, the route heads southeast on two-lane undivided Whiteleysburg Road briefly before turning northeast onto Whites Lane. A short distance later, DE 12 intersects Two State Road and becomes Burnite Mill Road. The road runs through farmland with some woods and homes, passing through the community of Hollandsville. The route intersects Sandtown Road before it curves east and enters the town of Felton. At this point, DE 12 becomes West Main Street and heads into residential areas, crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade. The road name changes to East Main Street and it comes to an intersection with US 13 on the eastern edge of Felton. Upon leaving Felton, the route becomes Midstate Road and continues through agricultural areas with some woods and homes, passing to the north of the geographic center of Delaware. DE 12 crosses DE 15 and comes to a junction with Andrews Lake Road, where the name changes to Johnnycake Landing Road. The road passes through more rural areas before intersecting Carpenter Bridge Road and entering the town of Frederica, where it becomes West Front Street and is lined with homes. In the eastern part of town, the route splits into the one- way pair of West David Street eastbound and West Front Street westbound. Upon crossing Market Street, the one-way pair becomes East David Street eastbound and East Front Street westbound. DE 12 turns north onto two-way Frederica Road and leaves Frederica, passing through marshland and crossing Spring Creek, a tributary of the Murderkill River. DE 12 continues to its eastern terminus at an interchange with DE 1. The section of the route between Frederica Road and DE 1 in Frederica is designated as part of the Delaware's Bayshore Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE 12 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 6,719 vehicles at the eastern border of Felton to a low of 1,244 vehicles at the Sandtown Road intersection. None of DE 12 is part of the National Highway System. History What is now DE 12 existed as an unimproved county road by 1920. By 1924, the route was completed as a state highway between Hollandsville and Frederica and was proposed as a state highway between the Maryland border in Whiteleysburg and Hollandsville and within Frederica. The entire road between Whiteleysburg and Frederica was built as a state highway a year later. DE 12 was designated to run from US 13 in Felton east to US 113 (Frederica Road) in Frederica by 1936. By 1938, DE 12 was extended west to the Maryland border in Whiteleysburg. In 1965, US 113 was moved to a bypass to the east of Frederica, and DE 12 was extended north on the former alignment of US 113 to end at that route a short distance north of Frederica. In November 2009, construction began for a grade-separated interchange at DE 1 (which had replaced US 113); the interchange was completed in June 2011.

Sex pheromones specifically focus on indicating females for breeding, attracting the opposite sex, and conveying information on species, age, sex and genotype. Non-volatile pheromones, or cuticular contact pheromones, are more closely related to social insects as they are usually detected by direct contact with chemoreceptors on the antennae or feet of insects. Insect sex pheromones have found uses in monitoring and trapping of pest insects. Evolution Sex pheromones have evolved in many species. The many types of pheromones (i.e. alarm, aggregation, defense, sexual attraction) all have a common cause acting as chemical cues to trigger a response. However, sex pheromones are particularly associated with signaling mating behaviors or dominance. The odors released can be seen as a favorable trait selected by either the male or female leading to attraction and copulation. Chemical signaling is also used to find genetically different mates and thus avoid inbreeding. Females are often selective when deciding to mate, and chemical communication ensures that they find a high-quality mate that satisfies their reproductive needs. =Sexual selection= Females of the tiger moth Utetheisa ornatrix choose males that produce more pheromones. Common crow butterfly male (Euploea core) with hair pencils everted to disperse sex pheromone. Odours may be a kind of male \\"ornament\\" selected for by female choice. They meet the criteria for such ornaments that Charles Darwin set out in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. After many years of study the importance of such chemical communication is becoming clear. Males usually compete for scarce females, which make adaptive choices based on male traits. The choice can benefit the female directly and/or genetically. In tiger moths (Utetheisa ornatrix), females choose the males that produce the most pheromone; an honest signal of the amount of protective alkaloids the male has, as well as an indicator of the size of female offspring (females fertilised by such males lay more eggs). Male cockroaches form dominance hierarchies based on pheromone \\"badges\\", while females use the same pheromone for male choice. In most species, pheromones are released by the non-limiting sex. Some female moths signal, but this is cheap and low risk; it means the male has to fly to her, taking a high risk. This mirrors communication with other sensory modalities, e.g. male frogs croak; male birds are usually colourful. Male long-range pheromone signals may be associated with patchy resources for the female. In some species both sexes signal. Males can sometimes attract other males instead, the sex pheromone acting as an aggregation pheromone. =External fertilization and chemical duets= It is likely that most externally fertilizing species (e.g. marine worms, sea urchins) coordinate their sexual behaviour (release of sperm and eggs) using pheromones. This coordination is very important because sperm are diluted easily, and are short-lived. Coordination therefore provides a selective advantage to both males and females: individuals that do not coordinate are unlikely to achieve fertilisation and hence to leave offspring. The main selective advantage of outcrossing is that it promotes the masking of deleterious recessive alleles, while inbreeding promotes their harmful expression. =In humans= No study has led to the isolation of true human sex pheromones. While humans are highly dependent upon visual cues, when in close proximity, smells also play a role in sociosexual behaviors. An inherent difficulty in studying human pheromones is the need for cleanliness and odorlessness in human participants. Signalling Sexual development in the freshwater alga Volvox is triggered by tiny concentrations of a glycoprotein pheromone. Different species use a wide variety of chemical substances to send sexual signals. The first to be described chemically was bombykol, the silkworm moth's sex pheromone, which is a complex alcohol, (E,Z)-10,12-hexadecadienol, discovered in 1959. It is detected in the antennae of the male moth by a pheromone-binding protein which carries the bombykol to a receptor bound to the membrane of a nerve cell. The chemicals used by other moths are species-specific. For example, the Eastern spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana female pheromones contain a 95:5 mix of E- and Z 11-tetradecenal aldehydes, while the sex pheromones of other species of spruce budworm contain acetates and alcohols. Sexual development in the freshwater green alga Volvox is initiated by a glycoprotein pheromone. It is one of the most potent known biological effector molecules, as it can trigger sexual development at a concentration as low as 10−16 moles per litre. Kirk and Kirk showed that sex-inducing pheromone production can be triggered experimentally in somatic cells by heat shock. Uses A pheromone trap in use to monitor insect pests Sex pheromones have found applications in pest monitoring and pest control. For monitoring, pheromone traps are used to attract and catch a sample of pest insects to determine whether control measures are needed. For control, much larger quantities of a sex pheromone are released to disrupt the mating of a pest species. This can be either by releasing enough pheromone to prevent males from finding females, effectively drowning out their signals, or by mass trapping, attracting and removing pests directly. For example, research on the control of the spruce bud moth (Zeiraphera canadensis) has focused on the use of the pheromone E-9-tetradecenyl-acetate, a chemical the spruce bud moth releases during mating.

She is venerated in both the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions. She is also known as Uṣṇīṣa Sitātapatrā. It is believed that Sitātapatrā is a powerful independent deity emanated by Gautama Buddha from his uṣṇīṣa. Whoever practices her mantra will be reborn in Amitābha's pure land of Sukhāvatī as well as gaining protection against supernatural danger and witchcraft. Name Her name is composed of sita (\\"white\\") and ātapatrā (\\"parasol\\" or \\"umbrella\\").The Wheel of Great Compassion by Lorne Ladner and Lama Zopa Rinpoche (Wisdom Publications, 2001) p. 28 Forms There are several different forms of Sitatapatra including: with one face and two arms; with three faces and six arms; with three faces and eight arms; with three faces and ten arms; with five faces and ten arms; and, with 1000 faces, 1000 arms and 1000 legs. Mantras The Śūraṅgama Mantra of the Śūraṅgama Sūtra is the most commonly practiced mantra invoking her. According to Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, the \\"Great White Umbrella\\" is a sādhanā for healing illness, dispelling interferences and spirit possession, quelling disasters, and bringing auspiciousness. To do practice in full requires a kriyātantra abhiṣeka of Sitātapatrā. Symbolism Sitatapatra Sitātapatrā is one of the most complex Vajrayana goddesses.The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs by Robert Beer (1999) p.23 According to Miranda Shaw in the Buddhist Goddesses of India, Sitātapatrā emerged from Buddha's uṣṇīṣa when he was in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven. The Buddha announced her role to \\"cut asunder completely all malignant demons, to cut asunder all the spells of others...to turn aside all enemies and dangers and hatred.\\" Sitātapatrā's benign and beautiful form belies her ferocity as she is a \\"fierce, terrifying goddess, garlanded by flames, a pulverizer of enemies and demons.\\" In the Mahayana Sitatapatra Sutra, she is called Aparājita \\"Undefeatable, Unconquerable\\" and is also identified as a form of goddess Tārā. In other sutras, she is regarded as a female counterpart to Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. Like him, Sitātapatrā manifests in many elaborate forms: having a thousand faces, arms and legs, or simply as a feminine deity of great beauty. Known foremost for her \\"white parasol\\" she is most frequently attributed with the \\"golden wheel\\". The auspiciousness of the turning of the dharma wheel is symbolic of Buddhism, both in its teachings and realizations.

Bartolo di Fredi (c. 1330 – 26 January 1410), also called Bartolo Battiloro, was an Italian painter, born in Siena, classified as a member of the Sienese School. Biography He had a large studio and was one of the most influential painters working in Siena and the surrounding towns in the second half of the fourteenth century. He registered in the Guild of that city in 1355; he had several children, who all died before him, with the exception of Andrea di Bartolo. He was the companion of Andrea Vanni from 1353, and helped decorate the Hall of Council at Siena, in 1361. From 1356 he worked in the Collegiata, or principal church, of San Gimignano, some 30 km from Siena, where he painted the entire side of the left aisle with a cycle of frescoes of Scenes from the Old Testament; the completed work was signed and dated in 1367. In 1366 the Council of the city of Gimignano ordered a painting, representing Two Monks of the Augustine Order to be placed in the Palazzo Pubblico, in order to commemorate the settlement of some disputes which had long existed between that order and the city. In the early part of 1367 he was employed, along with Giacomo di Mino, in the decoration of the Cathedral of Siena. In 1372 he rose to a position in the government of the city, and was sent to welcome the new Podestà on his approach to Siena. In 1381 he was himself made a member of the Council. In 1382 he executed the Descent from the Cross now in the Sacristy of San Francesco, Montalcino. The same church also possesses panels painted by him containing the Baptism of Christ, figures of SS. Peter, Paul, and Francis, and five scenes from the Life of St Philip of Montalcino. In 1389, Bartolo, assisted by Luca Thome, painted the altar-piece for the Shoemakers' Company, in the Cathedral of Siena, and continued from that year until his death to furnish altar-pieces for the cathedral and other churches of Siena, which have now all disappeared. His style is marked by the rejection of the concrete figures associated with Pietro Lorenzetti to instead favor flatter decorative otherworldly compositions in the manner of Simone Martini and Duccio. He combined a spirit of fantasy with anecdotal details. The Honolulu Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Louvre, the National Museum of Serbia, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Musée des beaux-arts de Chambéry, the Musée du Petit Palais, Avignon, the Museo Civico e Diocesano d'Arte Sacra of Montalcino, the church of San Francesco, Lucignano, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Fralin Museum of Art are among the public collections having paintings by Bartolo di Fredi.

It generalizes the concept of a string, by not forcing the letters to always be in a fixed order, but allowing certain reshufflings to take place. Traces were introduced by Pierre Cartier and Dominique Foata in 1969 to give a combinatorial proof of MacMahon's Master theorem. Traces are used in theories of concurrent computation, where commuting letters stand for portions of a job that can execute independently of one another, while non-commuting letters stand for locks, synchronization points or thread joins.Sándor & Crstici (2004) p.161 The trace monoid or free partially commutative monoid is a monoid of traces. In a nutshell, it is constructed as follows: sets of commuting letters are given by an independency relation. These induce an equivalence relation of equivalent strings; the elements of the equivalence classes are the traces. The equivalence relation then partitions up the free monoid (the set of all strings of finite length) into a set of equivalence classes; the result is still a monoid; it is a quotient monoid and is called the trace monoid. The trace monoid is universal, in that all dependency-homomorphic (see below) monoids are in fact isomorphic. Trace monoids are commonly used to model concurrent computation, forming the foundation for process calculi. They are the object of study in trace theory. The utility of trace monoids comes from the fact that they are isomorphic to the monoid of dependency graphs; thus allowing algebraic techniques to be applied to graphs, and vice versa. They are also isomorphic to history monoids, which model the history of computation of individual processes in the context of all scheduled processes on one or more computers. Trace Let \\\\Sigma^* denote the free monoid, that is, the set of all strings written in the alphabet \\\\Sigma. Here, the asterisk denotes, as usual, the Kleene star. An independency relation I on \\\\Sigma then induces a binary relation \\\\sim on \\\\Sigma^*, where u\\\\sim v if and only if there exist x,y\\\\in \\\\Sigma^*, and a pair (a,b)\\\\in I such that u=xaby and v=xbay. Here, u,v,x and y are understood to be strings (elements of \\\\Sigma^*), while a and b are letters (elements of \\\\Sigma). The trace is defined as the symmetric, reflexive and transitive closure of \\\\sim. The trace is thus an equivalence relation on \\\\Sigma^*, and is denoted by \\\\equiv_D. The subscript D on the equivalence simply denotes that the equivalence is obtained from the independency I induced by the dependency D. Clearly, different dependencies will give different equivalence relations. The transitive closure simply implies that u\\\\equiv v if and only if there exists a sequence of strings (w_0,w_1,\\\\cdots,w_n) such that u\\\\sim w_0 and v\\\\sim w_n and w_i\\\\sim w_{i+1} for all 0\\\\le i < n. The trace is stable under the monoid operation on \\\\Sigma^* (concatenation) and is therefore a congruence relation on \\\\Sigma^*. The trace monoid, commonly denoted as \\\\mathbb {M}(D), is defined as the quotient monoid :\\\\mathbb {M}(D) = \\\\Sigma^* / \\\\equiv_D. The homomorphism :\\\\phi_D:\\\\Sigma^*\\\\to \\\\mathbb {M}(D) is commonly referred to as the natural homomorphism or canonical homomorphism. That the terms natural or canonical are deserved follows from the fact that this morphism embodies a universal property, as discussed in a later section. Examples Consider the alphabet \\\\Sigma=\\\\\\\\{a,b,c\\\\\\\\}. A possible dependency relation is :\\\\begin{matrix} D &=& \\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\}\\\\times\\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\} \\\\quad \\\\cup \\\\quad \\\\\\\\{a,c\\\\\\\\}\\\\times\\\\\\\\{a,c\\\\\\\\}  &=& \\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\}^2 \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{a,c\\\\\\\\}^2  &=& \\\\\\\\{ (a,b),(b,a),(a,c),(c,a),(a,a),(b,b),(c,c)\\\\\\\\} \\\\end{matrix} The corresponding independency is :I_D=\\\\\\\\{(b,c)\\\\,,\\\\,(c,b)\\\\\\\\} Therefore, the letters b,c commute. Thus, for example, a trace equivalence class for the string abababbca would be :[abababbca]_D = \\\\\\\\{abababbca\\\\,,\\\\; abababcba\\\\,,\\\\; ababacbba \\\\\\\\} The equivalence class [abababbca]_D is an element of the trace monoid. Properties The cancellation property states that equivalence is maintained under right cancellation. That is, if w\\\\equiv v, then (w\\\\div a)\\\\equiv (v\\\\div a). Here, the notation w\\\\div a denotes right cancellation, the removal of the first occurrence of the letter a from the string w, starting from the right- hand side. Equivalence is also maintained by left-cancellation. Several corollaries follow: * Embedding: w \\\\equiv v if and only if xwy\\\\equiv xvy for strings x and y. Thus, the trace monoid is a syntactic monoid. * Independence: if ua\\\\equiv vb and a e b, then a is independent of b. That is, (a,b)\\\\in I_D. Furthermore, there exists a string w such that u\\\\equiv wb and v\\\\equiv wa. * Projection rule: equivalence is maintained under string projection, so that if w\\\\equiv v, then \\\\pi_\\\\Sigma(w)\\\\equiv \\\\pi_\\\\Sigma(v). A strong form of Levi's lemma holds for traces. Specifically, if uv\\\\equiv xy for strings u, v, x, y, then there exist strings z_1, z_2, z_3 and z_4 such that (w_2, w_3)\\\\in I_D for all letters w_2\\\\in\\\\Sigma and w_3\\\\in\\\\Sigma such that w_2 occurs in z_2 and w_3 occurs in z_3, and :u\\\\equiv z_1z_2,\\\\qquad v\\\\equiv z_3z_4, :x\\\\equiv z_1z_3,\\\\qquad y\\\\equiv z_2z_4.Proposition 2.2, Diekert and Métivier 1997. Universal property A dependency morphism (with respect to a dependency D) is a morphism :\\\\psi:\\\\Sigma^*\\\\to M to some monoid M, such that the \\"usual\\" trace properties hold, namely: :1. \\\\psi(w)=\\\\psi(\\\\varepsilon) implies that w=\\\\varepsilon :2. (a,b)\\\\in I_D implies that \\\\psi(ab)=\\\\psi(ba) :3. \\\\psi(ua)=\\\\psi(v) implies that \\\\psi(u)=\\\\psi(v\\\\div a) :4. \\\\psi(ua)=\\\\psi(vb) and a e b imply that (a,b)\\\\in I_D Dependency morphisms are universal, in the sense that for a given, fixed dependency D, if \\\\psi:\\\\Sigma^*\\\\to M is a dependency morphism to a monoid M, then M is isomorphic to the trace monoid \\\\mathbb{M}(D). In particular, the natural homomorphism is a dependency morphism. Normal forms There are two well-known normal forms for words in trace monoids. One is the lexicographic normal form, due to Anatolij V. Anisimov and Donald Knuth, and the other is the Foata normal form due to Pierre Cartier and Dominique Foata who studied the trace monoid for its combinatorics in the 1960s. Trace languages Just as a formal language can be regarded as a subset of \\\\Sigma^* the set of all possible strings, so then a trace language is defined as subset of \\\\mathbb{M}(D) all possible traces. A language L\\\\subseteq\\\\Sigma^* is a trace language, or is said to be consistent with dependency D if :L=\\\\bigcup [L]_D where :[L]_D=\\\\\\\\{[w]_D \\\\vert w\\\\in L \\\\\\\\} is the trace closure of a set of strings.

It is located on Mission Island in Thunder Bay, on the shore of Lake Superior. Thunder Bay GS was in operation from 1963 to 2018. It was the last coal fired station in Ontario. The plant was initially shut down in April 2014 as part of Ontario's phase out of coal-fired electricity generation, before being converted to run on advanced biomass (wood pellets) and recommissioned on February 9, 2015. Historic operations Thunder Bay GS began operation in 1963, with one 100 MW coal-fuelled generating unit. Two additional coal-fuelled units were added in the early 1980s, and in 1984 the original 100 MW unit was removed from service. This plant is connected to the power grid via 115 KV and 230 KV transmission lines. The station occupies on Mission Island, at the mouth of the Kaministiquia River delta on Thunder Bay. The plant's chimney is tall. The two coal-fuelled boilers provided a peak output of 326 MW fuelled by low- sulphur lignite coal from the Ravenscrag Formation in Southern Saskatchewan and low-sulphur sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River Basin in the United States. While operating as a coal plant, annual production was approximately 1.5 billion kilowatt-hours (KWh), enough energy to supply over 100,000 households for one year. Conversion from coal There were multiple announcements on the future of Thunder Bay GS over a 10-year period. The Ontario government initially proposed a conversion to natural gas in 2004 but subsequently cancelled that plan in 2006. Then, as part of the 2010 Long-Term Energy Plan, Ontario's Ministry of Energy announced that Thunder Bay GS would be converted from coal to natural gas by the end of 2014. This was part of the Ontario government's commitment to phase out all of its coal-burning power generation. On 1 November 2012, OPG announced that the Ontario Power Authority requested that the conversion to natural gas be suspended until the Ontario Power Authority could assess generating needs in northwestern Ontario. The next announcement on the generating station's fate was made in November 2013 when the Ministry of Energy announced that Thunder Bay GS would be converted to advanced biomass. Ontario’s Minister of Energy Bob Chiarelli outlined the broad terms of the conversion in a directive to the Ontario Power Authority dated 16 December 2013. Chiarelli noted that the station will have only one unit operating as a peaking plant and that OPG is only permitted to purchase 15,000 tonnes of fuel annually. It was estimated that the 15,000 tonnes of fuel will permit the single unit to operate at 2% of capacity. The generating station will have a five-year contract to produce electricity starting in January 2015. , the plant burns steam treated wood pellets (biocoal) from Arbaflame in Norway. On July 27, 2018 OPG and IESO announced the closure of Thunder Bay Generating Station due to having a leak in the boiler causing the station to be shut down since May. Estimated repair costs would be about $5 million and the contract expiration in 2020 was not intended to be renewed.

The detention centre established in 1868 has a long history; it became notorious during the Nazi era as one of the main sites of capital punishment, where about 3,000 inmates were executed. Famous inmates include East Germany's last communist leader Egon Krenz. History The prison was founded by resolution of the Prussian government under King William I and built until 1879 on the estates of the Plötzensee manor, named after nearby Plötzensee Lake (Plötze is the local German name of the common roach, cf. Płoć in Polish). The area divided by the Berlin-Spandau Ship Canal opened in 1859 was located at the outskirts of the Tegel forest northwest of the Berlin city limits in the Province of Brandenburg. The theologian Johann Hinrich Wichern had established the Evangelical Johannesstift borstal nearby, which in 1905 moved to Spandau–Hakenfelde. In 1915, the lands east of the canal with Plötzensee Lake were incorporated into Berlin (the present-day Wedding district), the remaining area around the prison walls became part of the Berlin Charlottenburg borough upon the 1920 Greater Berlin Act. Since 2004, it belongs to the Charlottenburg-Nord locality. The original name of what is today Haus 1 was Strafgefängnis Plötzensee, which also translates to Plötzensee Prison. Up to 1,400 inmates lived on premises of including a church and a Jewish prayer area, then the largest prison of the German Empire. After World War II, the buildings demolished by the bombing of Berlin were rebuilt and housed a youth detention center (Jugendstrafanstalt Berlin) for offenders between the ages of 14 and 21. When it in 1987 moved to a newly built annex on Friedrich-Olbricht-Damm in the west, Haus 1 of Plötzensee Prison again became a men's prison with capacity for 577 inmates. Upon the end of the Cold War and German reunification, the last communist East German leader Egon Krenz, convicted for manslaughter by Schießbefehl order at the Berlin Wall, from 2000 until 2003 served his sentence there. In 1983, a modern women's prison was built south of Friedrich-Olbricht-Damm on the Bundesautobahn 100 (Stadtring) highway, since 1998 it houses the JVA Charlottenburg for about 300 adult male prisoners, mainly drug addicts. One in three inmates of the prison is incarcerated for repeated public transport fare evasion.Schwarzfahrer hinter Gittern, die Tageszeitung, 2010Jeder Dritte in Plötzensee sitzt wegen Schwarzfahrens, Der Tagesspiegel, 2008 Plötzensee Memorial Exterior sign at Plötzensee Memorial, 1984 Plötzensee Memorial, 2005 During Imperial and Weimar Republic eras until 1933 there were 36 executions carried out in Plötzensee, all for murder and all by beheading with an axe according to the old German Strafgesetzbuch penal code. After the Nazi Machtergreifung, the prison housed both regular criminals and political prisoners. Plötzensee was one of eleven selected central execution sites established in 1936 throughout Germany by the order of Adolf Hitler and Reich Minister of Justice Franz Gürtner. Each was operated by a full-time executioner carrying out the rising numbers of death sentences, especially after the penal law was again tightened in World War II. By a 1943 agreement with the OKW they became also responsible for the execution of Wehrmacht members according to German military law. The convicts were beheaded by a stationary guillotine (Fallbeil), from 1942 also by hanging. During the Nazi regime, an official record of 2,891 people convicted by the Berlin Kammergericht, the notorious \\"People's Court\\" under Roland Freisler and several Sondergerichte, were executed in Plötzensee, initially with an axe in the prison's courtyard. From 1937 the convicts were beheaded with a guillotine brought from Bruchsal Prison and installed in a backyard work shed, a ground-level brick building near the prison walls, to where the victims had to walk from a nearby cell block. In 1942, a beam was assembled in the same room, serving as gallows for up to eight victims at one time. The bereaved were obliged to pay a fee of 1.5 Reichsmarks for each day the detainee had spent in prison plus an extra execution charge of 300 Reichsmarks. Executions of opponents of the Nazi regime Peter Buchholz; \\"OMGUS MILITARY TRIBUNAL - CASE THREE OMT-III-W-56 / Witness Peter Buchholz, former prison chaplain at the Berlin-Plötzensee Prison, who described prison conditions there. He stated that there were people executed there during his time for whom stay of execution papers were in processing, perhaps even reprieve action.\\" About half of those executed were Germans, most of whom were sentenced to death for acts of resistance against the Nazi regime, among them members of the Red Orchestra, the 20 July plot and the Kreisau Circle. 677 executed prisoners were from Czechoslovakia, among them many members of the Czech resistance to Nazi occupation from 1938-39 onwards. 253 death sentences were carried out against Poles, and 245 against French citizens. These people included both the members of resistance organizations and people who were deported to Germany for forced labour. About 300 were women. After execution, their bodies were released to Hermann Stieve, an anatomist at the medical college of what is now Humboldt University of Berlin. He and his students or assistants dissected them for research purposes. Stieve was especially interested in the effects of stress on the menstrual cycle, and wrote 230 papers based on this research, among them one that demonstrated that the rhythm method was not an effective method of preventing conception. After an RAF air raid in the night of 3 September 1943 irreparably damaged the guillotine and destroyed large parts of the prison buildings, State Secretary Curt Rothenberger in the Reich Ministry of Justice via telephone ordered the immediate execution of the Plötzensee condemned. About 250 people—six of them \\"erroneously\\"— waiting in rows of eight were hanged during the so-called Plötzensee Bloody Nights from 7 to 12 September. The last execution was carried out on 20 April 1945. The remaining inmates were liberated by the Red Army in the course of the Battle of Berlin five days later. Memorial wall covering the execution shed Today the execution shed is a memorial site operated by the Memorial to the German Resistance institution to commemorate those executed by the Nazis. Separated from the prison area, it was dedicated by the Senate of Berlin on 14 September 1952 in the remaining two rooms with its drain and the preserved gallows. The guillotine had been dismantled after the war and disappeared in the Soviet occupation zone. Onto the execution room a memorial wall was built \\"To the Victims of Hitler's Dictatorship of the Years 1933–1945\\". In 1963, the Catholic Diocese of Berlin erected its memorial for the victims about to the west in the commemorative church of Maria Regina Martyrum, the nearby Protestant Church of Plötzensee was inaugurated in 1970, featuring a Danse Macabre cycle (Plötzenseer Totentanz) by Alfred Hrdlicka.

One of about 30 around the United Kingdom, the building was used throughout its operational existence as the regional headquarters and control centre for the Royal Observer Corps's No. 20 Group YORK between 1961 and 1991. It has become an English Heritage Scheduled Monument and was opened in 2006 by English Heritage as a tourist attraction. During its Cold War operational period, the building could have supported 60 local volunteer members of the Royal Observer Corps, inclusive of a ten-man United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation scientific warning team. They would have collated details of nuclear bombs exploded within the UK and tracked radioactive fallout across the Yorkshire region, warning the public of its approach. This example of an ROC control building is the only one that is preserved in its operational condition. The others stand derelict or have either been demolished or sold. A few have been converted to other uses, like No. 16 Group Shrewsbury that is now a veterinary clinic, another is a recording studio, two are satellite and communications control centres, and one is a solicitor's file storage facility. The fully restored building contains air filtration and generating plant, kitchen and canteen, dormitories, radio and landline communication equipment and specialist 1980s computers and a fully equipped operations room with vertical illuminated perspex maps.

Williams spearheaded the city's initial land acquisition for what would become the Bartow Municipal Airport. In 1942 the US Government took over the site and later developed it into a training field for the U.S. Army Air Forces. Through World War II the field was used for pilot training. The base was ordered deactivated on 25 October 1945 and it closed by the end of the year. The airport was then returned to the City of Bartow by the General Services Administration (GSA). GSA required that the airport be used as an airport, and if not, that it be returned to the U.S. Government. In 1945–1950 a fixed-base operator (FBO) ran the airfield and flight line, while the large complex of support buildings that had been built by the Federal Government was used by industry and for storage. In 1946 about 32 former military barracks were converted into apartments for returning military veterans. In 1950 the U.S. Government exercised its reversal clause for the facility and again took control. The Department of Defense concurrently called for bids from civilian contractors to man and operate a primary pilot training school for U.S. Air Force student pilots. Renamed Bartow Air Base, the installation was a USAF primary flight training facility for the Air Training Command (ATC) from 1951 to 1960. USAF operations officially ended in 1961 and the facility was transferred to the city again by the GSA. Forty years after the deactivation of Bartow AB, a retired USAF T-37 was loaned to the city and the airport by the National Museum of the United States Air Force and placed on a permanent static display pylon as a memorial to the former U.S. Army Air Forces and U.S. Air Force presence at Bartow. The T-37 is near the former air base main gate, now the airport entrance, and The Museum Room in the airport's main terminal commemorates the airport's military heritage. From 1960 through 1967 the City of Bartow again managed the airport and the aviation facilities were again leased to a fixed-base operator. In 1964 the City requested authority from the Federal Aviation Administration to convert a large building area into an industrial park. The concept was approved and the industrial park opened. In July 1967 the City of Bartow established the Bartow Municipal Airport Development Authority, with five city commission members and an executive director. In 2019, Bartow Municipal Airport and Industrial Park was renamed to Bartow Executive Airport. The authority name was also changed to what is now known as the Bartow Airport Authority. The airport has been self-supporting since its inception. Using its aircraft refueling, storage facilities and Industrial Park for revenues, the Authority has maintained the facility as a public airport.

He is a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (1992), the Grammy Hall of Fame (1999, for the song \\"Soul Man\\"), the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame (1997), and he was a Grammy Award–winning (1967) and multiple Gold Record award-winning recording artist. Biography Sam & Dave were the most successful and critically acclaimed duo in soul music history, according to Rolling Stone magazine, and brought the sounds of the black gospel church to pop music with their string of call-and-response hit records. Primarily recorded at Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee, from 1965 through 1968, these songs included \\"Soul Man\\", \\"Hold On, I'm Coming\\", \\"I Thank You\\", and other Southern soul classics. Other than Aretha Franklin, no other soul act during Sam & Dave's hitmaking Stax years (1966–1968) had more consistent R&B; chart success, which included 10 consecutive top 20 singles and 3 consecutive top 10 LPs.Rob Bowman, liner notes from the CD An Anthology of Sam & Dave: The Stax Years, p. 1. \\"Soul Man\\" has been recognized as one of the best or most influential songs of the past 50 years by many organizations, including the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Rolling Stone Magazine, and RIAA Songs of the Century. \\"Soul Man\\" was used as the soundtrack and title for both a 1986 film and a 1997–1998 television series. Nicknamed \\"Double Dynamite\\" for their energetic and sweaty, gospel-infused performances, Sam & Dave were also considered by critics to be one of the greatest live performing acts of the 1960s. The duo has been cited as a musical influence by numerous artists, including Bruce Springsteen, Michael Jackson, Phil Collins, and Stevie Winwood. The Blues Brothers, which helped create a major resurgence of popular interest in soul, R&B;, and blues music in the 1980s, was heavily influenced by Sam & Dave; their biggest hit was their top 20 cover of \\"Soul Man\\", and their act and stage show was patterned after Sam & Dave's. Early years (1958–1964) The seventh of ten children, Prater was born in Ocilla, Georgia, where he grew up singing gospel music in the church choir, and was a veteran of the gospel group the Sensational Hummingbirds, in which he sang with his older brother, J. T. Prater. Dave Prater met his future partner, Sam Moore, in the King of Hearts Club in Miami in 1961, signing to Roulette Records shortly thereafter. Sam & Dave released six singles for Roulette, including two songs that Prater co-wrote with Moore. Prater was typically featured as the lead vocalist on these records, with Moore typically singing harmony and alternate verses. Stax years (1965–1968) They were signed in late 1964 by Jerry Wexler to Atlantic Records, with an agreement that allowed them to record in Memphis with Stax Records. Their first two singles failed to chart, but the duo's November 1965 single, \\"You Don't Know Like I Know,\\" started a series of ten straight top twenty Billboard R&B; hits, including \\"Hold On, I'm Comin'\\" (1966), \\"You Got Me Hummin'\\" (1966), \\"When Something Is Wrong with My Baby\\" (1967), \\"Soul Man\\" (1967), and \\"I Thank You\\" (1968). Starting with \\"Hold On, I'm Comin'\\", Moore was typically given the lead vocal (first verse and lead voice in chorus) on most of their recordings. Prater sang the tenor lead first verse on their only ballad to become a hit single, \\"When Something Is Wrong with My Baby\\", demonstrating an impressive vocal range in the upper register. All of their biggest hits were written and produced by Isaac Hayes and David Porter, who worked as songwriters for Stax. Sam & Dave's Stax records also benefited greatly from the backing of the Stax house band, Booker T. & the M.G.'s, and the Stax horn section, the Mar-Keys. These highly regarded musicians co-wrote (often without credit) and contributed greatly to the recordings. Sam & Dave's Stax recordings through 1967 were engineered by Stax founder and co-owner Jim Stewart, who created the \\"Memphis sound\\" at Stax by recording sessions essentially live in a single take. The combination of all of these respected talents contributed to the unique sound and commercial success of Sam & Dave's Stax recordings. Atlantic years, solo career, and back with Sam and Dave (1968–1981) Stax and Atlantic severed their distribution agreement in 1968, and as a result Sam & Dave became Atlantic recording artists and were no longer able to work with Hayes, Porter and the Stax musicians. The records made by Atlantic did not have the same sound and feel as the Stax recordings, and most only placed in the lower ends of the music charts if at all. The ending of their association with the Stax record label and their frequently volatile relationship contributed to the break-up of the duo in June 1970. After the break-up with Sam, Prater went back to their early Miami label, Alston Records, where he recorded one single, \\"Keep My Fingers Crossed\\" backed with \\"Love Business\\" (Alston A-4596), and also performed sporadically over the next year. Sam & Dave reunited in August 1971 and performed throughout most of the decade through 1981. They enjoyed a brief resurgence in popularity due to the Blues Brothers's 1979 recording of \\"Soul Man\\". Sam & Dave also recorded \\"Come On, Come Over\\", which appeared on the debut LP of jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius. Dave also appeared in the Paul Simon movie One Trick Pony as part of Sam & Dave. Their last performance together was on December 31, 1981, at the Old Waldorf in San Francisco. The New Sam and Dave Revue (1982–1988) In 1982, Prater started touring with Sam Daniels. This duo was also billed as Sam & Dave. They performed together until Prater's death in 1988. Moore attempted to legally block Prater from using the group's name without his participation and permission, but was generally unsuccessful in stopping the act from performing. The Daniels–Prater incarnation of Sam & Dave played as many as 100 shows per year, including gigs in Europe, Japan and Canada. In 1985, Prater and Daniels released a medley of Sam & Dave hits newly recorded in the Netherlands, which peaked at number 92 on the R&B; chart and was credited to \\"Sam & Dave\\". Moore made the label recall the single for using the \\"Sam & Dave\\" name without permission, and the record was relabelled and reissued under the name of \\"The New Sam & Dave Revue\\". Prater's last performance with Daniels was on April 3, 1988, at a Stax Reunion show at the Atlanta Civic Center, which also featured Isaac Hayes, Eddie Floyd, and Rufus and Carla Thomas. Six days later, on April 9, 1988, Prater died in a car crash in Sycamore, Georgia, while driving to his mother's house. Prater summed up his thoughts on his career for Gerri Hirshey, who quoted him in her book Nowhere to Run (1984, Southbank Publishing): Personal life Prater was married to Annie Belle Henderson from March 1962 to November 1969 and had five children with her.

Biography Born at Saint-Paulien, near Le Puy-en-Velay in southern France, Galien entered the Dominican Order at Le Puy. He studied philosophy and theology at the Dominican institution in Avignon with such success that he was sent to Bordeaux as professor of philosophy as early as 1726. From the year 1745 on he held the chair of theology at Avignon, and from 1747 the chair of philosophy. He seems to have resigned his professorship in 1751 to devote his energies entirely to the study of meteorology and physics. Galien died in 1762 in the Dominican monastery at Le Puy, or, according to other accounts, in 1782 at Avignon. Publications He published Lettres théologiques touchant l'état de pure nature, la distinction du naturel et du sur-naturel, et les autres matières qui en sont de conséquences (Avignon, 1745); also the Explication physique des effets de l'électricité (Avignon, 1747). But Galien's most important contribution was a booklet that he issued anonymously in 1755 at Avignon under the title \\"Mémoire touchant la nature et la formation de la grêle et des autres météores qui y ont rapport, avec une conséquence ultérieure de la possibilité de naviger [sic] dans l'air à la hauteur de la région de la grêle. Amusement physique et géométrique\\". The second edition of this booklet, this time with the name of its author, appeared as early as 1757. The change in its title renders it easy to discern what made the monograph so interesting. It was now called: \\"L'art de naviguer dans les airs, amusement physique et géométrique, précédé d'un mémoire sur la formation de la grêle.\\" The airship After propounding his theory regarding hailstorms, Galien calculates how large an airship would have to be in order to transport an entire army with its equipment to Africa. His scheme was to construct a gigantic cubic vessel of good, strong canvas of double thickness plastered with wax and tar, covered with leather and reinforced in places with ropes and rigging; its edge was to be 1,000 toises (roughly 2,000 m), and each surface 1,000,000 sq. toises (approximately 4,000,000 m²) in area. In both length and breadth it would be larger than the city of Avignon, and would resemble a fair-sized mountain. It would carry 54 times as much weight as did Noah's Ark, and be capable of transporting an army with its artillery and provisions for a year. The air being lighter at the summit of a mountain than at the level of the sea, by filling this vessel with the mountain air, it must displace, being on the ground, a mass of air of greater weight than that with which it was filledplus the weight of the craft and its cargo. This vessel would have to float in the atmospheric level of the \\"hail belt\\", as the atmosphere there is a thousand times lighter than water, while in the strata above this, into which the top of the cube would extend, the air is two thousand times lighter than water. For the scientific principles of his proposal Galien relied on Francesco de Lana, S.J. and perhaps also on Gaspar Schott. His chief claim to importance lies in the fact that the Montgolfier brothers were acquainted with him, or at least his booklet. His birthplace was very near to theirs and like Galien, the Montgolfiers began with meteorological observations; moreover, the elder of the brothers made a first ascension at Avignon in 1782. In aeronautical works Galien is, for the most part, unfairly treated; as the writers assume that his scheme was meant seriously, contrary to his statement given on the title page.

The school was founded in 1926 and follows in the tradition of the Presentation Sisters, founded by Nano Nagle, and currently educates approximately 1000 girls from grades 7–12. St Rita's is a member of the Catholic Secondary Schoolgirls' Sports Association. The school's motto is Latin, Virtute Non Verbis, which translates to English as Actions Not Words. History St Rita's College was founded by two Presentation Sisters, Sister Alice Kennedy and Sister Mary Madden, and was established as a kindergarten through to senior school on 27 September 1926. The initial enrolment consisted of 16 students with kindergarten - grade 3 being co-educational and grade 4 - senior girls only. Boarders were accepted from all grades. By 1960 the primary school grades of St Rita's had been transferred to St Agatha's Primary School on the adjacent site. By 1970 St Rita's College no longer offered a boarding facility to its students. School buildings * Nano Nagle Centre: Completed in 2011, the Nagle Centre houses the College's Information Technology network and support centre, main reception, eight modern teaching rooms, a large function room with panoramic views across the bay and northern suburbs, as well as the two-level Resource Centre. The Resource Centre has been designed to cater for whole class, small group and individual working modes and connects to three other buildings, allowing easy access. * Acqua Rosa Centre: In 2003, the Acqua Rosa Centre was completed – a 25 m x 25 m x 2 m heated pool. Not only is this building state of the art, but it is also aesthetically pleasing. The foyer houses the stained glass windows depicting St Rita's life as well as the structured glass windows that depict the logo and emblem of each House. The pool itself is inlaid with a stain glass rose. In the beautiful landscaped gardens rests one of the blocks from the old pool. * Eirene Centre: Construction of the Eirene Centre with its multi-purpose hall, Art classrooms, Film and TV classrooms and function room was completed in 2000. This building also housed a 120,000 litre tank to store storm water from the extensive roof. This water is being used to irrigate the grounds. * Kennedy Centre: Built in 1938, the Kennedy centre is named after one of the founding sisters of the school and the school's first principal, Sr Alice Kennedy, the centre contains multi-purpose classrooms. * Sr Elvera Sesta Science Centre: Constructed during the 1970s, the science centre was originally named after Nano Nagle, and housed 4 science laboratories. In 2011, coinciding with the construction of the new Nano Nagle Centre, the science building had an additional 2 laboratories added to the top floor and was renamed after former Principal, Sr Elvera Sesta PBVM, herself a science graduate of the University of Queensland. * Presentation Centre: Built in 1995, the Presentation Centre houses the school's Pantry, Computer Laboratories, and Hospitality Rooms. * Sacred Heart Centre: Built in 1964, the Sacred Heart centre contains the school's student reception as well as 10 multi-purpose classrooms and a state of the art Physics laboratory. * Stanley Hall: Built in the late 1880s, and originally the only building on the school's grounds, it was once used to accommodate the 14 sisters that lived at the school in the Presentation Convent. During 2009 the school's sisters chose to move to a more convenient residence, handing stewardship of the heritage listed building to the College management. In 2013 the building was extensively renovated as the senior administration and teaching staff hub. * Trinity Centre: Constructed in the early 1980s the Trinity centre houses the college's auditoriums, concert hall, music room, band room and drama rooms. The centre takes its name from the Father, Son and Holy Spirit - the Trinity.

It runs roughly parallel to U.S. Route 12 and the right-of-way of the South Shore line, along the NIPSCO easement. Other names by which the trail, or parts of it, are popularly known include \\"Hancock/Calumet Trail\\", \\"Jack Stevens Trail\\" and \\"Snowmobile Trail #17\\". The trail runs for about from Mineral Springs Road in Dune Acres, Indiana, near Cowles Bog, to a point by the county line of Porter County and LaPorte County, very close to the parking lot entrance of a local sand dune landmark, Mount Baldy. The surface is of crushed limestone and is frequently used by cyclists and joggers in the warmer months, and skiers in the winter. Deer and other wildlife are often seen along the trail, which loosely connects with other bicycle/multi-use trails in northwestern Indiana in a loose arc from near the Illinois state line to near the Michigan state line, bringing trail users in proximity to Indiana Dunes National Park and Indiana Dunes State Park. The Calumet Trail is managed by the Porter County Parks Department. The trail was constructed in 1976, and is the first dedicated bicycle trail in Indiana. At that time, the trail was paved with asphalt blacktop for its entire length. However, the wetlands the trail passes through deteriorated the pavement, and the trail was unusable by the late 1990s. In 2001, the trail was repaired, and the crumbling pavement was replaced with crushed limestone, and the iconic covered bridge over Brown Ditch was constructed. After years of being vandalized, the covered bridge was removed in September of 2012.

Beginning in childhood or adolescence, people with this condition experience bouts of sustained muscle tensing (myotonia) that prevent muscles from relaxing normally. Myotonia causes muscle stiffness, often painful, that worsens after exercise and may be aggravated by eating potassium-rich foods such as bananas and potatoes. Stiffness occurs in skeletal muscles throughout the body. Potassium-aggravated myotonia ranges in severity from mild episodes of muscle stiffness to severe, disabling disease with frequent attacks. Potassium-aggravated myotonia may, in some cases, also cause paradoxical myotonia, in which myotonia becomes more severe at the time of movement instead of after movement has ceased. Unlike some other forms of myotonia, potassium-aggravated myotonia is not associated with episodes of muscle weakness. Mutations in the SCN4A gene cause potassium-aggravated myotonia. The SCN4A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for the normal function of skeletal muscle cells. For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles contract and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of positively charged ions, including sodium, into skeletal muscle cells. The SCN4A protein forms channels that control the flow of sodium ions into these cells. Mutations in the SCN4A gene alter the usual structure and function of sodium channels. The altered channels cannot properly regulate ion flow, increasing the movement of sodium ions into skeletal muscle cells. The influx of extra sodium ions triggers prolonged muscle contractions, which are the hallmark of myotonia. Potassium-aggravated myotonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In some cases, an affected person inherits a mutation in the SCN4A gene from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.

The bones become fragile and deformed over time as a result. Orthopedic pathology, also known as bone pathology is a subspecialty of surgical pathology which deals with the diagnosis and feature of many bone diseases, specifically studying the cause and effects of disorders of the musculoskeletal system. It uses gross and microscopic findings along with the findings of in vivo radiological studies, and occasionally, specimen radiographs to diagnose diseases of the bones. Causes and Effects Orthopaedic disorders may be congenital and there may be hereditary and environmental factors that can affect the normal functioning of the bones, joints, or muscles. Other causes of bone diseases include severe impacts/injuries and weakness in bones/bone loss. Many patients who are diagnosed with bone diseases have no risk factors. However, there are risks including chronic disorders, disease, exposure to radiation and heredity factors. A direct cause of the formation of bone tumours has not been identified yet, however there are possible origins such as injuries to the bone, treatment from radiation and genetics. The effects of bone disorders will vary with disease. The effects can occur physically, mentally and financially as well as impact the individuals quality of life. Orthopaedic disorders can drastically affect an individual's functional ability. Individuals who have suffered from bone diseases can experience complications such as extreme pain, fractures, height loss and the ability to be mobile. They can also be more susceptible to other issues, for example, a Urinary tract infection (UTI) or Pneumonia. Many of these bone disorders could lead to declines in both mental and physical health. In addition to a physical impact, bone disorders can also give rise to psychological ramifications and reflect negatively on an individual's mindset, body image as well as self-esteem, which may result in the individual feeling helpless and yield fears of falling. To care for bone diseases and disorders is quite expensive. These costs can include both direct and indirect medical expenses as well as possible job loss or productivity loss for the patient. The chances of death vary enormously between the bone disorders due to the differing degree of severity, however many bone diseases do increase an individual's susceptibility to other complications. These disorders depend on multiple factors such as genetics and environmental factors, thus chances range between many individuals. Individuals are more susceptible to bone fractures as they age with a possibility of more major consequences. This is due to the continual loss of minerals in the bones such as Calcium as well as hormonal changes. Menopause results in mineral loss in bone for women and a slow decline of the production of sex hormones could lead to the development of bone disorders in men, mainly Osteoporosis. The elderly may be more susceptible due to medications they may be taking, worsening in vision as well as decreased ability to use muscle and bones to control balance. As a common bone disorder, osteoporosis affects a large section of the population, resulting in a reduced quality of life, ill health, a variety of diseases/disabilities and death as a possible consequence. Loss of bone minerals means a decline in bone mass, thus bones will be weaker in some areas resulting in individuals to be at risk of minor or major falls that could be detrimental. It is known that exercise can allow for stronger bones in order to slow down bone loss in individuals as muscle mass can be built to support and reduce the risks of bone disease. Weight and balance training, Aerobic exercise and walking are examples of exercises that can maintain an individual's bone mass. In addition rotational movements in which the bone can be pulled with the muscle are seen to be beneficial. Nutrition and smoking is also very important in the development and prevention of bone diseases. = Symptoms = Symptoms that patients may experience when bone disorders form can include bone deformities, hip pain, overgrowing of bone in an individual's skull which can result in headaches and a loss of hearing, pain and numbness in arm or legs if the spine is affected and an overall weakness in the body particularly in the hip and knee joints. = Treatments = Individuals that are diagnosed with bone disorders need to pay attention to secondary causes as medications and the presence of other disorders can also have major effects. Drugs that can prevent bone loss are called antiresorptives. They can slow the degradation of the skeletal system and decrease the risk of subsequent bone injuries fractures. They can help in repairing the individual's bone strength. In addition to antiresorptives, anabolic therapy can also promote the build up of bones and prevent prospective risks. There are also drugs that can deteriorate bone mass. Glucocorticoid is produced naturally by the body itself in the form of cortisol, however it is known that high levels of this hormone both naturally and synthetically can result in a decreased ability for the body to form bone cells, instead amplifying the breaking down of bone minerals. This impacts the bone loss in an individual's body. Other medications that can affect the production of bone cells and enhance bone loss and fractures include breast cancer and prostate cancer drugs, anti-seizure drugs, blood pressure medication, heartburn drugs and diuretics. There are also medical conditions such as neurological disorders, malabsorption, sex hormone deficiency, diabetes, kidney disease and hyperthyroidism that can influence bone disorders. Types of Disorders By classifying and understanding the different types of bone diseases, orthopaedic pathologists are able to identify the causes and effects. = Bone Cancer/Tumours = The two most common forms of bone cancer are Ewing's sarcoma and osteosarcoma. They are highly aggressive pediatric tumours. Ewing sarcoma form in bones or soft tissue, whereas osteosarcoma makes weakened bones at the end of longer ones. There are multiple other bone cancers that are more rare: Chondrosarcoma is identified mainly through the production of cartilage from the cells. Depending on the type of chondrosarcoma, it ranges from a slow growth which is able to be removed, to a rapid growth and uncontrollable spread to other parts of the body, known as metastasis. A Chordoma is another type of cancer that slowly grows into nearby bones and many soft tissues in the spine, ranging from the base of the skull to the tailbone. Chordomas have around a 40% metastasis rate and mainly spread to the lungs. (rare cases) soft-tissue sarcoma causes: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) is a form of soft tissue cancer, which mainly targets the arms and legs. It is undifferentiated as under a microscope, the tumour cells appear different to the body cells in which it develops, and is characterised as pleomorphic because it takes many different forms and sizes. Fibrosarcoma occurs in the fibrous cells that join muscles to bones, most commonly in the arms, legs and pelvis Sarcoma of Paget’s disease of the bone occurs in people that already have Paget’s disease, mainly aged above 70. It is very aggressive and difficult to control Common orthopaedic diseases include; arthritis, back/foot/hand/knee/neck/shoulder pains, osteoporosis, Paget’s disease of the bone and soft-tissue injuries. =Non-neoplastic disorders= Bone diseases include non-neoplastic disorders, which are diseases that are not caused by abnormal growths such as cancer. These consist of genetic diseases, osteoporosis, infections of the bone, and Paget's disease of bone. = Neuromotor Impairments = Neuromotor impairments refer to the conditions that are established at or before birth in the affected person, regarding damage or unnatural behaviors of the brain and spinal chord, or more generally, the Nervous system. The transmission of specific signals through Neurons by the brain to all parts of the body is hindered by neuromotor impairments, generally causing a range of problems regarding motion and movement of all parts of the body. Common effects are loss of limb functionality, urinary control, and the spinal alignment. two examples of neuromotor impairments are Cerebral palsy and Spina bifida. = Degenerative Diseases = Degenerative diseases are classified due to their nature of destroying Motor neurons, responsible for the movement of all muscle groups within the body. Common examples of degenerative diseases are Parkinson's disease and Muscular Dystrophy. = Musculoskeletal Disorders = Musculoskeletal disorders (or MSDs) are disorders that directly alter the movement and capabilities of the musculoskeletal system or movement of the body. This includes parts such as the muscles, nerves, ligaments, tendons, nerves, etc. These disorders or diseases include Carpal tunnel syndrome, Tendonitis, tedndon/muscle/ligament strains and sprains, Spinal disc herniation, and more. Identification Techniques The results from identification techniques help orthopaedic pathologists diagnose the disease. Commonly used techniques include; Arthrography, blood tests and bone scans, Computed Tomography (CT scans) and intrathecal contrast enhanced CT scans, Doppler ultrasonography, Flexibility/range of motion tests, Radiographs (x-rays) and x-ray Absorptiometry, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), muscle tests, physical examinations by observation and Lab studies. During a Biopsy, depending on the type and location of the tumour, an orthopaedic pathologist will examine the tissue sample removed from the patient and interpret the cells, tissues, and organs to diagnose disease Image guided biopsies include radiographs (x-rays) and computed tomographies (CT scans). These diagnostic techniques are very common imaging techniques which can detect many injuries and fractures to the bone as well as tumours. There is no definite evidence which states that small amounts of Radiation from these techniques can cause cancer. These imaging techniques can be used for the diagnosis of bone cancers and tumours, in order to identify the size and location of the tumour. A biopsy may be necessary to confirm the presence of a bone tumour. Fine-needle aspiration is conducted, where a sample of tissue is taken from the tumorous area using a thin needle. It can then be examined under a microscope and analysed by an orthopaedic pathologist. The age of the patient and the location of the tumour are very important considerations in the diagnosis of bone tumours. Orthopaedic Pathology: Pets The field of orthopaedic pathology stretches to household pets, mainly in cats and dogs, due to their susceptibility to orthopaedic impairments. Some common orthopaedic conditions in pets are; Joint problems, fractured (broken bones), Older musculoskeletal injuries, Ruptured ligament, Anterior cruciate ligament injury, Dislocation of the patella and Arthritis. = Arthritis = Arthritis in pets (and humans) occurs when a joint is inflamed due to the deterioration of lubricants and soft tissue surrounding major joints such as the hips, knees, shoulder and elbows.  Common forms of arthritis  Osteoarthritis / Degenerative Joint Disease: This is the most common type of arthritis and is a continuous decay of cartilage, caused by friction within the joints through movement. Septic arthritis / Inflammatory Joint Disease: Septic arthritis is brought upon by infection or an inherited compromised immune system and is seen in the build up of fluid within the joints and an inflammation of cartilage. Rheumatoid arthritis / Polyarthritis: Polyarthritis is the result of the body's immune system attacking a joint, causing damage to cartilage and tissue.  Diagnosis of arthritis  A physical test is conducted for signs of the following: Crepitus (grinding/cracking/grating/crunching etc. of joints), rough/deformed bones, Discomfort associated to swelling or tenderness, or Muscle atrophy (Decrease in muscle size). If required, the following tests may be used; Radiograph (x-ray) with the animal under Anesthesia and if necessary, a Radiocontrast agent (contrast dye) may be used in the joints before undergoing the test. Force plate analysis, where a pressure plate on the floor reads the distribution of weight by the dog/cat to detect a favouring of one limb over the others. Joint fluid aspiration, which is the physical removal of fluid around joints to confirm either degenerative or inflammatory arthritis References Category:Anatomical pathology ","title":"Orthopedic pathology"},{"id":"10739482","text":"Archibald Austin (August 11, 1772 – October 16, 1837) was a nineteenth-century politician and lawyer from Virginia. Biography Born near Buckingham Courthouse, Austin studied law and was admitted to the bar, commencing practice in Buckingham County, Virginia. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1815 to 1817 and was elected a Democratic-Republican to the United States House of Representatives in 1816, serving from 1817 to 1819. He was not a candidate in 1818. Afterwards, he resumed practicing law and was a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket in 1832 and 1836. Austin returned to the House of Delegates in 1835, serving again until 1837. He died near Buckingham on October 16, 1837, and was interred in the family cemetery with his wife Grace, on his estate. His law office was built on the family plantation. His legal papers were sold in the early part of 20th century to the College of William and Mary, the collection is housed in the Swem Library. Many court records burned up in 1869 during the courthouse fire, Austin's files are invaluable for research in court records of the period. References *Early Buckingham County, VA Legal Papers.

Biography McWilliams was born in 1904 to a poor pioneer family in Hitchcock, Oklahoma. In his earlier days McWilliams was well known for using an American-flag-draped covered Conestoga wagon for publicizing his rallies and speeches, as well as for drawing attention to his cause. Most of his early rallies were impromptu street presentations that at times ended violently, as one did on July 4, 1940 in New York City. A crowd which had supported McWilliams turned ugly when McWilliams began to disparage Jews, Communists and businessmen for the world's problems, and McWilliams was arrested. McWilliams used the arrest to further his cause through newspaper reports of his speech and the violence that resulted. In 1939, he led a group called Christian Mobilizers that splintered from the Christian Front founded by Charles Coughlin. McWilliams supported an escalation on the violence against Jews and communists and also supported cooperation with the German American Bund. In 1940, he ran for Congress as a Republican in the 18th Congressional District of New York, which is around the Yorkville section of Manhattan. After losing by a large margin, he ran for Congress under the American Destiny Party, a political organization he'd founded and based on the Nazi Party. McWilliams was disqualified from the ballot after failing to gather enough signatures. In 1944, McWilliams was identified as the main defendant in the government prosecution of 30 suspected conspirators and sympathizers under the Smith Act. The 30 were widely varied, including the anti-Capitalist Fascist Lawrence Dennis. After seven months U.S. District Court Judge Edward C. Eicher died of a heart attack, causing a mistrial.\\"Trial's End,\\" Time Magazine, December 11, 1944. After the war ended, the government chose not to pursue the case. After World War II, he briefly worked on the campaign of North Carolina Democratic Senator Robert Rice Reynolds, who had been a fascist sympathizer. McWilliams died in 1996.
