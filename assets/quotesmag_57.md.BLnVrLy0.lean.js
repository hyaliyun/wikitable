The border defence soldiers of the Coastal Brigade had the task of observing shipping movements on the Baltic Sea and identifying escape attempts. By means of a fixed telescope with high magnification, the four-man crew could observe a wide area up to 12 nautical miles from the observation platform. At night the vicinity could be illuminated with a searchlight on the roof of the tower. The basic equipment on the observation deck included a radio station, a stand-by generator and heating. Below the windows were sealable embrasures for weapons. The guards recorded every apparently suspicious movement. The radio equipment was part of the border reporting network, so border patrol vessels and land-based units could be alerted immediately. The Baltic Sea border tower dominated the landscape of the Baltic Sea coast. Soldiers of the Border Brigade patrolled the beach, and were supported as needed by mobile searchlights and fully equipped service vehicles.  Society  Using this boat a family with 2 children escaped over the Baltic A society prevented the planned demolition of the tower in 1990 and, on their own initiative, restored the building and the technical facilities. In 1991 the border tower was declared a historic monument and it is included in the list of heritage monuments in K√ºhlungsborn. The tower is accessible using an internal steel ladder.  Documented escape attempts  Information boards around the tower describe various successful escape attempts as well as those prevented by the border guards. One of the most famous escapees was Peter D√∂bler, who swam across the Baltic Sea in 1969, reaching the island of Fehmarn 40 km away after about 25 hours. In the exhibition room next to the watchtower are several items used for escapes, such as the inflatable boat that took a family with two children. Some of the soldiers' issued equipment are also displayed. The impact of the former Baltic Sea frontier on local residents is described. = Gallery = File:K√ºhlungsborn_Ostseegrenzturm,_Beispiel_eines_Grenzsoldaten.jpgThe border troops looked like this.

The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1988. Overview Yamanaka Castle overlooks the strategic T≈çkaid≈ç highway halfway of western slope of Hakone Pass. The T≈çkaid≈ç highway was the main route between Kyoto and the Kanto region of Japan. The castle has a long and narrow structure, consisting of two lines of connected enclosures extending west and south of the second bailey, which is located just below the inner bailey. These enclosures are protected by deep, wet and dry moats. History The late H≈çj≈ç clan was based at Odawara Castle in far western Sagami Province and only a few kilometers from the border with Suruga Province ruled by the Imagawa clan. The H≈çj≈ç and Imagawa maintained an alliance; however, after the fall of the Imagawa clan, Suruga was occupied by the Takeda clan of Kai Province and the H≈çj≈ç territories were threatened. This threat did not diminish after the Takeda clan was destroyed by an alliance between Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, both of whom were at odds against the H≈çj≈ç. Yamanaka Castle was built by H≈çj≈ç Ujiyasu in the Eiroku era (1558‚Äì1577) to guard against this threat. Despite the growing tension between the H≈çj≈ç and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, only a modest attempt was made to strength the defenses of the castle. When the Toyotomi armies attacked Odawara in 1590, Hideyoshi ordered Toyotomi Hidetsugu and Tokugawa Ieyasu to reduce Yamanaka Castle as quickly as possible, as it lie directly in his line of communications between the front lines and Osaka. In March, the two commanders attacked Yamanaka castle with 50,000 soldiers. In response, H≈çj≈ç Ujikatsu resisted with only 4,000 troops. Despite the disparity in numbers, the Toyotomi forces took heavy losses, including one general, Hitotsuyanagi Naosue; however, the castle fell in only a half day of combat and most of its defenders were killed. Yamanaka Castle was not rebuilt during the Edo period, and the site reverted to forest. All that remains are fragmentary portions of its moats and earthworks. In 2006, the site of Yamanaka Castle was listed as one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation, primarily due to its historical significance.

Trained by Meiko Satomura, Okuda started her career in the Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling promotion in 2006, where she originally worked under her real name and later under the ring name . In 2009, Okuda quit Sendai Girls' and affiliated herself with Team Makehen under the new ring name . After returning from a year-long hiatus due to a knee injury in March 2012, Okuda became a freelancer and began working for promotions such as Apache Pro-Wrestling Army, Universal Woman's Pro Wrestling Reina and World Woman Pro-Wrestling Diana under her real name. Professional wrestling career =Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling (2005‚Äì2009)= Okuda first became interested in professional wrestling, when her elementary school class made a field trip to an All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) event, where she met Taka Michinoku. After deciding to become a professional wrestler herself, Okuda contemplated entering Michinoku's Kaientai Dojo wrestling school, before opting to instead train at a dojo, which concentrated entirely on training female, or joshi, wrestlers. On October 2, 2005, Okuda took part in an audition held by Meiko Satomura, and, after passing it, was admitted to the first training class of Satomura's new Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling promotion, and began training under her in Sendai the following December. Sendai Girls' held its first event on July 9, 2006, during which the promotion's first four trainees all made their debuts against joshi veterans. While the other three trainees were all defeated in their matches in five to six minutes, Okuda's debut match with Mayumi Ozaki lasted fifteen minutes, but, in the end, also ended in the trainee suffering a defeat. During the rest of the year, Okuda also suffered defeats against Chikayo Nagashima, Devil Masami and Hiroyo Matsumoto, before gaining her first win on January 10, 2007, by defeating fellow trainee Sachiko Kanari. On April 8, Okuda entered the Battlefield War Tournament, again defeating Sachiko Kanari in her first round match. On May 6, she was eliminated from the tournament in the second round by Ayako Hamada, who would go on to win the entire tournament. On July 14, Okuda accompanied Meiko Satomura to an Oz Academy event, where she, after a match, confronted Satomura's opponent Aja Kong and eventually accepted her challenge for a match between the two. On August 16, Okuda made her in-ring debut for the promotion, unsuccessfully challenging Kong for the Oz Academy Openweight Championship. On August 26, Okuda made her debut for the JWP Joshi Puroresu promotion, teaming with Ayana Mizumura and Meiko Satomura in a six-woman tag team match, where they defeated Arisa Nakajima, Kaori Ohki and Tsubasa Kuragaki. In September 2007, all five Sendai Girls' trainees were given new ring names as a sign of their progress. Sendai Girls' co-founder Jinsei Shinzaki, remembering past wrestlers like Jaguar Yokota and Lioness Asuka, decided that Okuda should be given the name of an animal and, as a result, she was renamed Tyrannosaurus Okuda. In her first match under the new name on September 8, Okuda teamed with Meiko Satomura in a losing effort against the team of Ayako Hamada and Ayako Sato. Under her new name, Okuda started an interpromotional storyline rivalry with JWP's top junior wrestler, Arisa Nakajima. One early notable match in the rivalry saw Okuda and Nakajima team up with their respective mentors, Meiko Satomura and Azumi Hyuga, in a tag team match at a Sendai Girls' event on October 5, which was won by the JWP duo. In the finish of the match, Hyuga legitimately broke Satomura's orbital bone with a running knee strike, which left her sidelined from in-ring action for over a year. As a result, Satomura positioned Okuda, her top student, as the new face of Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling. On November 18, Okuda defeated Arisa Nakajima in the main event of a Sendai Girls' event to win the JWP Junior and Princess of Pro-Wrestling (POP) Championships. Okuda made her first defense of the titles on December 9, defeating Kaori Ohki at a JWP event. On December 29, Okuda defeated Hiroyo Matsumoto in the main event of a Sendai Girls' event to make her second successful title defense. Two days later, Okuda appeared at JWP's 5th Junior All Star event, teaming with Aoi Kizuki and Aya Yuki in a six-woman tag team main event, where they were defeated by Arisa Nakajima, Hanako Kobayashi and Hiroyo Matsumoto. On February 23, 2008, Okuda main evented another Sendai Girls' event, losing to Aja Kong in a rematch of their Oz Academy encounter. On March 15, Okuda made her third successful defense of the JWP Junior and POP Championships, defeating Aya Yuki. On April 20, Okuda entered Sendai Girls' first Jaja Uma tournament, defeating Ito Dojo representative Hanako Kobayashi in her first round match, and followed that up by defeating freelancer Kana in her second round match on May 23. On June 8, Okuda returned to JWP, losing the JWP Junior and POP Championships back to Arisa Nakajima in her fourth defense. On June 27, Okuda was eliminated from the Jaja Uma tournament in the semifinals by Ibuki representative Hiroyo Matsumoto. In the finish of the match, Okuda was dropped on her head and neck with a backdrop driver and knocked unconscious. After being taken to a hospital, she was diagnosed with a concussion and a rotator cuff tear on her left shoulder, for which she underwent surgery in November. Before making her return to the ring, Okuda suddenly announced on January 25, 2009, that she was quitting Sendai Girls', relocating to Tokyo and turning freelancer. =Freelancing (2009‚Äìpresent)= On February 20, 2009, Okuda made an appearance at a Team Makehen event, announcing that she had joined the independent group, as a member of which her independent bookings were handled by its founder Tomohiko Hashimoto. Okuda's jump to the group led to the dissolution of a working relationship between Sendai Girls' and Team Makehen; Io Shirai, Mio Shirai and Mika Mizunuma made regular appearances for Sendai Girls' in 2008, but were no longer booked by the promotion after the jump in 2009. Okuda collaborated with the Ringstars professional wrestling magazine to start a contest for its readers to come up with a new ring name for her. On April 25, Okuda wrestled her first match in ten months at a Team Makehen event, where she, now working under the ring name Basara, teamed with Mikado to defeat Bambi and Mio Shirai in a tag team match. However, just two months later, Team Makehen went inactive as president Tomohiko Hashimoto resigned from his position after being arrested on charges of blackmail. On July 18, Okuda suffered another concussion and canceled all of her scheduled appearances for the rest of the year. In December, Team Makehen was dissolved, making Basara a true freelancer. Basara finally returned to the ring on April 29, 2010, at a Vader Time independent event. On June 5, she returned to the ring with Hiroyo Matsumoto, losing to her at a NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling event. On July 4, Basara made her debut for Pro Wrestling Wave, when she and Bambi defeated Misaki Ohata and Moeka Haruhi for the TLW World Young Women's Tag Team Championship. On August 5, Basara made a special appearance for All Japan Pro Wrestling, defeating Kyusei Ninja Ranmaru in a singles match. Two days later, Basara returned to JWP, wrestling in a match, where she was defeated by Leon. On September 26, Basara, Leon and Misaki Ohata formed the Shishi no Ana stable, with Basara now scheduled to become a regular member of the JWP roster. On October 31, Basara wrestled at a Yuzuki Aikawa produced Yuzupon Matsuri event, facing American Hailey Hatred. The match had to be ended abruptly, when Basara suffered a knee injury and was unable to continue. Okuda underwent surgery on April 8, 2011, and was sidelined from in-ring action for the entire year. She was originally scheduled to make her return at a Happy Hour!! event on December 18, but the return had to be postponed, when the event was canceled. On March 7, 2012, Okuda announced that she would wrestle her return match on March 25 at an event held by the Apache Pro-Wrestling Army promotion. On March 25, Basara was defeated by Taka Michinoku in her return match. On April 22, Basara made her debut for Universal Woman's Pro Wrestling Reina at Reina 31, wrestling Saya to a ten-minute time limit draw and then challenging the promotion's founder, Yumiko Hotta, to a match. Seven days later at Reina 32, Basara was defeated by Hotta. Following the match, Hotta suggested that Basara turn a new leaf in her career and return to competing under her real name. On May 13 at Reina.33, Okuda, now once again working under her real name, teamed with Saya in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto. Following the folding of Reina, most of the promotion's roster remained together to form the new Reina X World promotion, but Okuda chose to follow Yumiko Hotta out and on May 22, the two, along with Saya, made their debut as a unit for the World Woman Pro-Wrestling Diana promotion, interrupting a main event battle royal and starting an invasion storyline with the promotion. On June 25, Okuda was again sidelined, after suffering yet another knee injury while training. Okuda underwent two knee surgeries, first in August 2012 and the second in April 2013. On May 24, 2015, Okuda returned to the ring, wrestling her first match in nearly three years at an event co-produced by Apache Pro-Wrestling Army and Doutonbori Pro Wrestling, where she, Hasegawa and Mede Tiger Mask defeated Mister Furyu, Mister UO and Super Delfin. Having passed what she called her \\"test match\\", Okuda wrestled her proper comeback match on July 17 at Sano Damashii's big Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan event, where she, Hi69 and Yosuke Enomoto defeated Hasegawa, Mika Iida and Tomohiko Hashimoto in a six-person intergender tag team match.

It relates a day‚Äôs activities of General James F. Hollingsworth during the Vietnam War. It first appeared in the British newspaper The Sunday Times. Nicholas Tomalin (30 October 1931 ‚Äì 17 October 1973) was an English investigative reporter and foreign correspondent who wrote for various London newspapers. He died while reporting the 1973 Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur War. Tomalin wrote \\"The General Goes Zapping Charlie Cong\\" for the weekly London paper The Sunday Times, which ran the story on 5 June 1966. General James Francis Hollingsworth (24 March 1918 ‚Äì 2 March 2010) was born in Sanger, Texas on a family farm. He graduated from Texas A&M; in 1940 and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army. A decorated and battle hardened World War II veteran, Hollingsworth was a forty- eight year old Brigadier General when Tomalin wrote this Sunday Times article. Historical context 1966 saw a period of escalation (i.e. increased U.S. involvement in the ground war) initiated by President Lyndon B. Johnson. This escalation was carried out in an attempt to halt the U.S. and South Vietnamese \\"losing trend\\" that had prevailed in prior months. The escalation was carried out in accordance with Phase Two of General William Westmoreland‚Äôs three- point victory plan. The escalation marked a significant shift in U.S. strategy (defensive to offensive), and provoked a matching escalation on the part of the North Vietnamese, trapping the two combatants in a perpetuating cycle of escalation. A key region wherein this escalation strategy was employed was the Iron Triangle, a 120 square mile area located roughly twenty-five miles north of Saigon, precisely the region that Hollingsworth describes to Tomalin at the outset of the article. Route 13 is a major thoroughfare running from Saigon, through the Iron Triangle, to the Cambodian border. It is a landmark that General Hollingsworth refers to specifically early in Tomalin‚Äôs article. The divisional office at Ki-Na (where Tomalin begins the narrative) is situated twenty miles north of Saigon, meaning that it was just to the south (or on the southern edge) of the Iron Triangle. The Iron Triangle was an insurgent stronghold during this period, where the Viet Minh maintained an elaborate tunnel system and logistic outposts. The strength of insurgent forces in this region posed a particularly palpable threat to the U.S. Forces and U.S.- backed South Vietnamese government due to the region‚Äôs close proximity to Saigon. The U.S. Army 1st Infantry Division (A.K.A. \\"The Big Red One\\", in which Hollingsworth was a general) carried out operations throughout this area during the period 1965-1970. These missions employed typical counterinsurgency tactics that were being fine- tuned in many countries engaged in civil and revolutionary wars during this era. Some major offensive missions undertaken (or participated in) by the 1st Infantry Division during this period were Operation Attleboro, Operation Cedar Falls, and Operation Junction City. Operation Attleboro was carried out in November 1966, the same year that Tomalin reported on General Hollingsworth. Of particular importance to these operations were Search and Destroy tactics, with forces inserted, seeking out and destroy the enemy, and then quickly withdraw. This allowed a smaller number of troops to secure and occupy a comparatively larger geographic area. The civilian casualties that could result was one factor contributing to international dissent and protest regarding the conflict, and also proved to be a significant obstacle to the pacification of the region. Against this background, the mission described by Tomalin was evidently a search and destroy mission, carried out in the southern part of the Iron Triangle in 1966, which General Hollingsworth participated in actively. The General uses an M16 (AR-15) carbine (rifle), flies in a Bell Iroquois UH-1B helicopter, which carries two M60 7.62√ó51mm calibre machine guns; all of these items were typical standard- issue equipment. On the whole, it seems that Tomalin witnessed a fairly representative Search and Destroy mission, a quotidian undertaking for General Hollingsworth.  Story summary  The story starts out describing how General Hollingsworth eliminates his enemies nonchalantly and is not bothered by their deaths. After pinning two medals on the Colonel's doctor for his outstanding efforts, Hollingsworth displays a map showing their next target. He states that the next mission is to free Routes 13 and 16 of any Viet Cong. Hollingsworth notes that these two roads were initially used to carry supplies up from Saigon to Phuoc Vinh. After the General motivates his team, he tells them all that they are going to \\"zap\\" all of the enemies so that no more remain. Once in his helicopter, he tells the pilots that it hasn‚Äôt been a very productive day for his unit; Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie Companies were unsuccessful in killing any enemies after finding a possible Viet Cong headquarters. When Hollingsworth learns that there has been some sniper activity in the area, he orders the pilots to take him to Battalion HQ, despite the pilots‚Äô hesitation. Once he arrives, Hollingsworth asks the soldiers if they have killed any Congs yet. After hearing that they have not, he is infuriated and demands that they start killing as soon as possible. Back in the helicopter, Hollingsworth sees the white smoke and then witnesses the air strike that is supposedly going to eliminate all enemy targets. He says that he wasn‚Äôt sure if the snipers were in this location, but if they weren‚Äôt, he was going to \\"zap\\" the whole forest if he had to. After the pilot points out two VC running in the bushes, General Hollingsworth grabs his M16 off of the rack and leans out of the helicopter, ready to shoot the two soldiers. A smoke canister is dropped and a white vapor covers the scene. Hollingsworth circles the area five times to secure the enemies killing. These attempts were unsuccessful after the narrator admits that he just saw the running figures in the bushes. The chopper is flown low into the ground and the Lieutenant grabs the runner. General Hollingworth assures himself that the man they captured was in fact a Cong, and then they land at a base camp. An ambulance quickly arrives to administer health care to this victim. Hollingsworth discovers that this man's objective was to mine at Route 16 and fire at enemy helicopters. The General compliments himself back and forth and says that he will attack whomever he has to in order to succeed. He then states that nothing is better than \\"killin‚Äô Cong\\". Literary elements =Opening and theme= \\"The General Goes Zapping Charlie Cong\\" opens with two brief, one- sentence paragraphs. These statements set the scene and establish the dual objective of the piece: first, to provide a brief, action- packed profile of a particularly martial general (the first sentence), and second, to investigate the causes of the tremendous civilian casualties resulting from the war. The first sentence says, in part, that the General \\"‚Ä¶took off in his personal helicopter and killed more Vietnamese than all the troops he commanded.\\" (Wolfe, 197). Although there is much violence and bloodshed during the course of Tomalin's afternoon with the General, the narrative does not explicitly say that the General killed anyone on this day‚Äîalthough as much can be assumed. The second brief paragraph relates a rumored statistic of civilian casualties: \\"‚Ä¶more than four injured civilians for every wounded Viet Cong‚Äîunavoidable in this kind of war.\\" (Wolfe, 197) This initially raises the running theme of the tremendous civilian casualties that are a consequence of the indiscriminate violence resulting from helicopter- based search and destroy missions. =Tone and narration= For the subject matter portrayed, the tone of \\"The General Goes Zapping Charlie Cong\\" is remarkably light. Tomalin's phrasing seems mostly descriptive, rather than evaluative or normative, allowing the reader to evaluate the situation (characters, events) described for him- or herself (and enabling Tomalin to provide a more impartial account). Tomalin's tone conveys a sense of action and adventure, but does not give the impression that the primary focus of the piece is the issue of civilian casualties. Tomalin's narration style is unobtrusive‚Äîpresumably in another attempt to provide \\"hard\\", objective coverage, he rarely interjects his own voice. He switches to first- person point of view occasionally (\\"I point at a paddy field full of peasants less than half a mile away.\\" (200), \\"A shower of spent cartridge cases leaps from the General‚Äôs carbine to drop, lukewarm, on my arm.\\" (200)) for a number of plausible reasons- perhaps to provide a realistic sense of perspective. The entire piece is written from Tomalin's perspective, although most of it is in the third- person, recounting the General's actions rather than Tomalin's internal experience. Tomalin only interjects his voice as an investigative reporter into the dialogue on a few occasions, and every time he does, his goal is to reinforce the theme of civilian casualties‚Äî for example, Tomalin asks \\"But General, how do you know those aren‚Äôt just frightened peasants?\\" (200). This technique creates a sense of narrative distance that helps Tomalin's account of the facts seem balanced and disinterested. Also, by employing a relatively light tone, Tomalin seems to express something about the nature of the mission; it is a combat mission, but the soldiers fighting from the air have a tremendous technological advantage over their enemies, and as such run a much smaller risk when entering into combat. Tomalin's relatively light tone (as well as the General's) conveys this sense of detachment from the battle. =Plot structure and setting= The plot of \\"The General Goes Zapping Charlie Cong\\" is very simple (and necessarily so given its length). The exposition can be considered to be everything from the opening sentence to the point when they take off in the General's helicopter. This section introduces the General, the theme of civilian casualties, and the day's mission and purpose. The rising action is the trip to Battalion HQ and the episode with the napalm strike. The climax comes during the episode involving the young Viet Cong who the General captures. This section is particularly relevant to the theme because, in this instance, the General captures, rather than kills the enemy‚Äîalthough it is a close call for the young Viet Cong. The denouement is the final section of the work, after medics treat the injured Viet Cong, when Tomalin is debriefing with the General. Hollingsworth relates his justification for his \\"shoot first, ask questions later\\" approach, and expresses his delight at having a journalist witness the events of the day. The setting, aside from the broader historical context discussed earlier (see History and Background) is the interior of the General's personal helicopter. Other than several brief scenes in various regional bases, the events of the story unfold inside the helicopter. =Characters= The only \\"round\\" (i.e. developed) character is the General. This conveys the sense that \\"The General Goes Zapping Charlie Cong\\" is a character profile of the General, even though the central issue of the piece is civilian casualties. Tomalin's physical description depicts the General as typical ‚Äî\\"‚Ä¶reminiscent of every movie general you have seen.\\" (198). Tomalin pays special attention to the General's mannerisms and colloquialisms. For instance, one of the General's lines is, \\"There‚Äôs nothing alive in there[‚Ä¶] or they‚Äôd be skedadling. Yes there is, by golly.\\" (201) An important aspect of the General's character is his certainty and justification for fighting in such an indiscriminate manner. The General relies on his battle- hardened instincts to determine if a potential threat is posed to himself or his men. His long military career and high rank make this explanation viable. However, it seems fair to wonder (in spite of the General's certainty), whether any civilians were injured or killed in these blind, airborne attacks, and also, whether the General behaved differently due to Tomalin's presence and observation. The other military personnel mentioned are utterly \\"flat\\" (i.e. undeveloped) characters. A few names are mentioned, but no additional details. After the General, the two most developed characters are the young Viet Cong insurgent who the General captures, and Tomalin, neither of whom can really be considered \\"round\\".  Effects and criticism  There is very little criticism about Tomalin's work. This story was included in Thomas Wolfe's collection of short articles known as The New Journalism. This collection covered an assortment of subject matters and served as a vehicle for this new type of journalism to flourish. Tomalin's work received notoriety after being published in this collection. The impact on English society, according to Wolfe, was effective because it gave them a sense of emotion for the Vietnam war. The English saw how the Congs were being murdered and \\"zapped\\" across the board and felt a sense of sorrow for the Vietnamese civilians that were being mistaken for soldiers. Wolfe also notes how Tomalin's piece created somewhat of an attraction of the war. One typically does not enjoy the act of war. \\"The General Goes Zapping Charlie Cong\\" spiked British people's interest and encouraged Sunday Times readers to follow the proceeding of the war.

Home media Robot Chicken DC Comics Special was released on DVD and Blu-ray, on July 9, 2013. Sources and influences The logo for the Robot Chicken DC Comics Special is a modification of that for the Super Powers Collection. The opening sequence of the special parodies that of the Challenge of the Super Friends albeit with the Legion of Doom substituted with Robot Chicken original characters Chicken, Mad Scientist, Nerd, Humping Robot, Composite Santa, Gummy Bear, the Unicorn, and Bitch Puddin'. Most of the figures used for the special are from the Mego World's Greatest Superheroes!, Mattel DC Universe Classics, and EMCE Toys/Mattel DC Retro Action Superheroes toylines. Brainiac and Lex Luthor would see both DC Universe Classics and DC Retro Action Superheroes versions (though, of course, the DC Retro Action Superheroes Brainiac figure was an original piece). The graphic for the \\"Real Characters from the DC Universe\\" is very similar to the Challenge of the Super Friends title graphic. The Hall of Justice is from the Super Powers Collection but is white rather than yellow to be in line with its appearance in Super Friends. The use of Mister Freeze, Captain Cold, Icicle, and Chillblaine as a group of cold-themed villains is an ongoing theme from DC Comics seeing previous versions including a team-up by Captain Cold, Icicle, and Minister Blizzard in Justice League of America #139 (February 1977), the Cold Warriors in Justice League Adventures #12 (December 2002), the Ice Pack in Super Friends #16 (August 2009), and Icicle, Icicle Jr, Mr. Freeze, Captain Cold, and Killer Frost in Young Justice \\"Terrors\\".

It is located in Patuakhali District. History =Origins= During the building of the school the founder of Barisal Government Brojmohon College, the late Brojmohon Dutt (first powerful Mufence of Patuakhali Mohakumar Magistrate), father of late Awshini Kumer Dutt, Nobin Chandra, Shen father of Congress leader Shotindronath Shen, Umesh Chandra Dash, father of leader Hiralal Dashgupta (who is the former owner of the present building of Shonali Bank), local lawyers, barristers and many other people played a very important role. In 1876 Akhwy Kumar De gave a place where they built a hut and first started a school named 'Patuakhali Entrance School' under the supervision of Magistrate Rosh Ranjan Pal as the headmaster of the school near the present district post office. The present school hostel and playground had previously been used for cultivation. In 1887 former SDO Mr. Foez Uddin Hossain took a lease on the property for the school and built an eight-room, single storied building with the help of the government and money from local villagers. In 1887 on the day of Moharani Victoria‚Äôs Golden Jubilee Festival they moved their school to the building from their old hut. On that day they named the school as ‚ÄòPatuakhali High English School‚Äô as the part of their school memorandum. =Move to present location= In 1912 the Indian government took over fifteen bigha of land near the school and handed it over to the Ministry of Education to make it a government school. When the education ministry gave an order to the acting committee to leave the school under government supervision the school committee disagreed, thinking that if they did do it then this school would lose the goodwill that it had. They took a lease under one taka tax and built the present school building. In the period of India, this school earned fame as the idol school in a very short period of time. As a result, in 1917 they got a donation from Calcutta University. At that time Pondikul Shiromoni Borda Kandoshen was the principal of the school. In 1931 the most brilliant student of the school Nobochandra Banarji took charge as principal, a position he kept for about 24 years. In his time Bongo Shardul A. K. Fazlul huq and former education minister Sir M. Azizul Huq came for a visit. In 1945 they started giving scholarship in every year of 5 taka per month to the student who gained the top score in the examination of high primary in every Union to study in the school. =Nationalization= In 1952 this school enlisted in Uplift Scheme. In 1962 it got enlisted in Maltire Tarol Scheme. On 15 November 1968, the school was nationalized and renamed as ‚ÄòPatuakhali Govt Jubilee High school‚Äô at the government level. Present day In January 2013, the school observed its 125th anniversary. Former alumni hold higher positions of Bangladesh, including Minister Shahjahan Mia, Justice Mohammed Nizamul Huq and Additional Deputy Attorney General MK Rahman.

As of October 2012, Indian Mujahideen, a terrorist group based in India, is suspected to be behind the attacks. The explosions occurred at locations within a radius of 1 km in Jangli Maharaj Road: in front of Balgandharva Auditorium, opposite to KFC restaurant near Garware Bridge, Dena Bank branch at Jangli Maharaj Road, and in front of a McDonald's restaurant. A fifth live bomb found on JM Road was later defused. The bombs left one injured. All blasts occurred between 7:27 pm and 8:15 pm. The bombings took place on the evening when the new Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde was scheduled to visit the Tilak Smarak Ranga Mandir, a play theatre in the city, for an award ceremony. Victims Dayanand Bhaurao Patil (age 34), a local tailor, was the only one who was injured. The bomb went off while he was handling the bag. Patil, with minor injuries on his face and stomach, was admitted to Sasoon Hospital and was later interrogated by the police as a suspect. Patil was carrying the explosives in a cake box with sticky material, two detonators and a pencil cell. According to his initial statement, Patil, on his way home, had stopped at Balgandharva Auditorium to listen to the speeches at the protest against corruption organised by India Against Corruption with his bag containing his lunchbox besides him. When he stood up to leave, he claimed that he must have picked up the wrong bag. After walking for some time, when he realised this and opened the bag, it exploded. Speculations The Police Commissioner of Pune suggested that given the low intensity of the blast and extent of damage, the attacks were rather a mischief than a terrorist attack. However, given the sophisticated circuitry used in the devices, central agencies suspected the role of an terrorist organisation. It was also speculated that the bombings may have been carried out to avenge the murder of Indian Mujahideen commander Qateel Siddiqui or to avenge a central government recommendation that the ban on SIMI be extended for a few more years. Qateel Siddiqui, named in 2010 Pune bombings, 2010 Jama Masjid attack and 2005 Indian Institute of Science shooting, was murdered at Pune's Yerwada Jail in June 2012. Few days ago, the Pune police had received a letter saying Qateel's death would be avenged. Investigations The Anti- Terrorism Squad of the Maharashtra Police promptly started investigation of the blasts. Eyewitnesses reported that the bombs were placed in a garbage can and a cycle carrier. The blasts were of such low intensity that members of India Against Corruption who were sitting for an andolan nearby did not know of the blast till the bomb disposal squad arrived. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the National Security Guards (NSG) were alerted following the blasts and NIA teams were dispatched to Pune and Mumbai. Ammonium nitrate was found to have been used as explosives, with 9 volts batteries as triggers. A total of seven IEDs were used in the blasts. Initially, the bomb disposal squad experts suggested that the moist weather may have reduced the intensity of the blasts. However, upon further investigation, it was found that while the bombs had been constructed to cause maximum damage and take many lives, a design flaw had prevented them from fully exploding. There were no individual suspects even on 2 August, primarily due to the fact that the CCTV cameras near the blast sites were non-functional. However, the use of bicycles and triggers suggested the possible involvement of Indian Mujahideen. The Pune Police was criticised for mishandling the evidence at the crime scene. Photographs showed cops lifting the bicycle used for the blasts with their bare hands, contaminating the fingerprints on the cycle. Gloves were not used by many cops while searching the crime scene. Policemen were seen searching for evidence with bullet proof vests, when they should have been using bomb suits and explosive trace detectors. By 3 August, based on the leads obtained from the owner of a cycle shop that had sold the bikes, the investigators were looking for two suspects aged between 25 and 30 who spoke Hindi and Gujarati,. While inspecting CCTV footage, investigators found a man, closely resembling Yasin Bhatkal, Indian Mujahideen (IM) operative, coming on a bicycle and parking it opposite the Sai Service petrol pump. = Arrests = As of 27 December 2012, a total of eight suspected Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorists have been arrested. The arrestees are: * Langde Irfan ‚Äì allegedly an expert in computer and brother-in-law of one of the Pune blast accused, Asad Khan, * Asad Khan ‚Äì allegedly a recruiter, motivator and ideologue of IM, * Imran Khan * Syed Firoze ‚Äì one of the planters * Sayed Maqbool alias Zuber, a history- sheeter, accused of making the IEDs used in the blasts. * Sayyed Arif alias Kashif Biyabani ‚Äì identified potential recruits for IM * Munib Iqbal Memon ‚Äì purchased the SIM cards for phones used in the blasts * Farooq Bagwan ‚Äì purchased the SIM cards for phones used in the blasts Delhi Police said that many of the arrestees confessed of their involvement in the blasts.

The school credited him with writing or coauthoring fifteen books and over one hundred other publications during his 30-year career with the school. Arguably, his most notable publication was Energy Future: the Report of the Energy Project, which he co-authored with Daniel Yergin in 1979. Following his retirement from Harvard, he moved to Houston, Texas, where he taught at Rice University for four years. After that, he published the first volume of his memoir entitled,\\"Starting from Arkansas: Four Continents, Four Countries,Four Kids.\\" Early years Stobaugh was raised in the small town of McGehee, Arkansas. His parents were Robert B. Stobaugh, Sr. and Helen Paris Stobaugh, who owned a laundry. He also had an older half-brother and a younger full brother. Robert entered school at the age of four, then later skipped a grade.Prewitt, Taylor. \\"Robert B. Stobaugh. Encyclopedia of Arkansas. 2017, Accessed February 28, 2017. At the age of 15, he enrolled in Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering in 1947. His first job as a chemical engineer was at the Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso) Refinery in Baton Rouge. He soon transferred to Creole Petroleum Corporation, which was then an Esso subsidiary, Then, he joined Caltex Petroleum Corporation, a joint venture of Standard Oil of California (now known as Chevron Corporation) and Texaco. He was first assigned to Caltex headquarters in New York City. This led to an assignment in Bahrain followed by a move to London He then joined Monsanto in the Houston area. While with Monsanto, Stobaugh realized that top managers typically had earned technical degrees, but had little training in business administration and economics. He corrected this deficiency in his own training by enrolling in a night school curriculum at the University of Houston. Academic career Stobaugh resigned from Monsanto and enrolled in the Harvard Doctor of Business Administration {DBA} program in 1965. He earned a doctorate in 1968 and became a tenured professor in 1971. In that same year, he led an HBS research team studying the relationship of overseas investment by American businesses and the U.S. economy. The team concluded that the effect was positive. Stobaugh testified before a congressional committee against legislation proposed to restrict such investment. In 1983 he was named as Charles Edward Wilson Professor of Business Administration, teaching courses in general management, energy, international business, and production.Harvard Business School Bulletin. \\"Update: Four Professors to Retire.\\" June 1996. In 1972, before the Arab oil embargo occurred, HBS Dean, Lawrence E. Fouraker, asked Stobaugh to organize a venture at HBS called the Energy Project.

Harvard Business Review. \\"Back to the Future.\\" December 2008. Retrieved August 2, 2012. In 1979, Stobaugh and a colleague, Daniel Yergin, co-authored Energy Future: the Report of the Energy Project at the Harvard Business School, which became a New York Times bestseller. This book was based on the premise that the United States should transition from a policy of unrestricted reliance on imported oil to a more diverse variety of energy resource, and presented the pros and cons of various energy alternatives. Stobaugh was later quoted as saying, ‚ÄúOur goal was to produce a plain English book that would provide a framework for thinking about the energy future.... We wanted to relate not only to academics, but also to the general public and people in the political world who were making key decisions.‚Äù The book received widespread publicity even outside academia and became a best seller. Its findings were briefed to President Jimmy Carter, and triggered major energy policy initiatives by the Carter Administration.

It gained university status in June 2012. History Jinnah Sindh Medical University, formerly known as Sindh Medical College, started on April 7, 1973 after approval of a committee constituted by the Government of Sindh. Approximately 200 students were admitted to their first year of a MBBS in 1973. Khawaja Moin Ahmed was appointed as the first principal of the college. The college initially began working in the pediatrics ward of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, which had been army barracks since 1865 and was given to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre in 1959. It started with only three departments: anatomy (including histology), physiology, and biochemistry. In later years, a new academic block was constructed to for departments of pathology, pharmacology, forensic medicine, and community medicine. It also has new museums, laboratories and administration block. Affiliations The university is fully accredited by the Higher Education Commission and the University Grants Commission (Pakistan). The University is also associated with other medical institutions such as the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, the National Institute of Child Health and the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases.National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases Merger In 2003, Sindh Medical College became a part of the Dow University of Health Sciences.

Mauritania is a country in Africa, bordering Algeria, Mali, Senegal, and the Western Sahara (currently controlled by Morocco). Officially, 100% of the country's citizens are Muslim, although there is a small community of Christians, mainly of foreign nationality. The two largest Sufi Muslim tariqas in Mauritania are Tijaniyyah and Qadiriyya. Because of the ethnic and tribal divisions in the country, religion is seen by the government as essential for national unity. There are around 4,500 Roman Catholics in the country of foreign origin. There are also a few adherents of Judaism working in the country. History It was trade with Muslim merchants that brought Islam into the region, in the 8th century. The Almoravid dynasty rose to power in the western Maghreb during the 11th century, and prosletyzed Islam throughout the region. Members of the Gadala Berbers brought back the theologian Abdallah ibn Yasin from Mecca in 1035, where they traveled for the hajj, to expunge the paganism still prevalent in Mauritania. Although Islam had existed in the region prior to the Almoravids, Almoravid rule accelerated the spread of Islam and removed animist influences on local Islamic practices. Ibn Yasin's strict interpretation of Islam alienated many of the Berbers, and the theologian was expelled. Undaunted, he accumulated a devoted following of loyal believers and an army, the foundation of the Almoravid dynasty. ibn Yasin's military expansion converted tribe members of the Gadala, Lemtuma, and Messufa Berbers of the region to Islam. The capture of Sijilmasa and Aoudaghost, important cities in the Trans-Saharan trade, allowed them to dominate the trade routes of the Sahara. The Almoravids converted the Berbers inhabiting modern-day Mauritania to the Maliki school of Sunni Islam, which remains dominant in Mauritania to this day. ibn Yasin was succeeded by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, a chieftain of the Lamtuna Berbers. Fighting between the Lemtuma and Messufa led ibn Umar to declare a holy war against the Ghana Empire to unify the tribes against a common enemy. The war, which lasted for fourteen years, spread Islam to the members of the Soninke people, founders of Ghana. The political influence of the Almoravids waned as the dynasty declined, but Islamic adherence was firmly cemented in the country. The political influence of the Kunta tribe between the 16th and 18th centuries bolstered the popularity of Qadiri Sufism in the region. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, declaration of jihads by Muslim theologians pushed for the establishment of Islamic governance in West Africa. In the 17th century, Nasir al-Din led a jihad in Mauritania, drawing support from Berbers frustrated with the corruption of the region's Arab rulers. The French colonial empire expanded into Mauritania by the 19th century. The West African jihads were brought to an end, following crackdowns by British and French colonists. In an effort to thwart militarism and threats of rebellion, French colonial administrators encouraged the influence of zaqiya, the religious tribes of Mauritania, over hassan, Mauritania's warrior tribes. =Post-independence = The country declared its independence in 1960 and established itself as an Islamic Republic. Independence brought Moktar Ould Daddah into power, who promoted Islam during his rule. A military coup d'√©tat ousted Daddah in 1978. Colonel Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla, one of the participants of the coup, became head of the government in 1980, and implemented Sharia law. Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, successor of Ould Haidalla, reversed some of these changes, but was ousted in a military coup in 2005. Political Islam, or Islamism, was introduced in the region during the 1970s. The instability that followed the coup that deposed Daddah invited elements of the Muslim Brotherhood, Wahabbism, and Tablighi Jamaat. The Islamists united as a political party in the 1980s, but were politically repressed starting in 1994. Government pressure on Islamist organizations continued throughout the 2000s. Funding by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies supported the establishment of Islamic schools, centers, and charities around the country, but were largely shut down by the government in 2003. In 2005, Islamists were arrested and accused of terrorism. Of the original eighty arrested, eighteen remained in prison by 2006. =Islam= Islam is by far the largest and most influential religion in the country, and has been since the 10th century. According to government census, 100% of the country's citizens are Muslim. Like much of North Africa, Mauritanians follow the Maliki school of Islam. Islam is the state religion, and sharia is used as the basis of judicial decisions. The five member High Council of Islam determines the compatibility of secular laws with Islamic laws. Government restrictions on religion In Mauritania, religious and secular NGOs are granted tax exemption. Based on the sharia stance on apostasy, the government forbids converting Muslims to competing religions. The publication of religious materials that are not Islamic is restricted. Religious education is considered mandatory, but only makes up a small portion of the public school curriculum. According to the Pew Research Center, although social conflict caused by religious hostilities is ranked Low in Mauritania, the amount of government restriction on the practice of religion is ranked High. Mauritania is the twelfth most religiously restrictive country in the world, ranked between Indonesia and Pakistan.  Literature  * Muriel Devey, ¬´ Terre d'islam ¬ª, in La Mauritanie, √âd.

It is a dynamic functional power that contains all of natural law, and is both sustentative and generative, organizing matter according to Platonic Ideas, that is, archetypes that lie beyond the physical realm coming from the Mind of God or Deity, the ground of Being.  Background  The role of nature was one faced by philosophers in the Age of Reason or Enlightenment. The prevailing view was either that of the Church of a personal deity intervening in his creation, producing miracles, or an ancient pantheism (atheism relative to theism) ‚Äì deity pervading all things and existing in all things. However, the \\"ideas of an all-embracing providential care of the world and of one universal vital force capable of organizing the world from within.\\" presented difficulties for philosophers of a spiritual as well as materialistic bent.  Cambridge Platonists  The Cartesian idea of nature as mechanical, and Hobbes' materialistic views were countered by the English philosopher, Ralph Cudworth (1617‚Äì1689), who, in his True intellectual system of the universe (1678), addressing the tension between theism and atheism, took both the Stoic idea of Divine Reason poured into the world, and the Platonic idea of the world soul (anima mundi) to posit a power that was polaric ‚Äì \\"either as a ruling but separate mind or as an informing vital principle ‚Äì either nous hypercosmios or nous enkosmios. Cudworth was a member of the Cambridge Platonists, a group of English seventeenth-century thinkers associated with the University of Cambridge who were stimulated by Plato's teachings but also were aware or and influenced by Descartes, Hobbes, Bacon, Boyle and Spinoza. The other important philosopher of this group was Henry More (1614‚Äì1687). More held that spiritual substance or mind controlled inert matter. Out of his correspondence with Descartes, he developed the idea that everything, whether material or non, had extension, an example of the latter being space, which is infinite (Newton) and which then is correlative to the idea of God (set out in his Enchiridion metaphysicum 1667). In developing this idea, More also introduced a causal agent between God and substance, or Nature in his Hylarchic Principle, derived from Plato's anima mundi or world soul, and the Stoic's pneuma, which encapsulates the laws of nature, both for inert and vital nature, and involves a sympathetic resonance between soul (psyche) and soma.  Cudworth's idea of 'the Plastick Life of Nature'  Like More, Cudworth put forward the idea of 'the Plastick Life of Nature', a formative principle that contains both substance and the laws of motion, as well as a nisus or direction that accounts for design and goal in the natural world. He was stimulated by the Cartesian idea of the mind as self-consciousness to see God as consciousness. He first analysed four forms of atheism from ancient times to present, and showed that all misunderstood the principle of life and knowledge, which involved unsentient activity and self-consciousness. :It is in connection with the refutation of hylozoic atheism that he brings forward the celebrated hypothesis, which he held in common with More, of a plastic nature,‚Äîa substance intermediate between matter and spirit,‚Äîa power which prosecutes certain ends but not freely or intelligently,‚Äîan instrument by which laws are able to act without the immediate agency of God... All of the atheistic approaches posted nature as unconscious, which for Cudworth was ontologically unsupportable, as a principle that was supposed to be the ultimate source of life and meaning could only be itself self-conscious and knowledgeable, that is, rational, otherwise creation or nature degenerates into inert matter set in motion by random external forces (Coleridge's 'chance whirlings of unproductive particles'). Cudworth saw nature as a vegetative power endowed with plastic (forming) and spermatic (generative) forces, but one with Mind, or a self-conscious knowledge. This idea would later emerge in the Romantic period in German science as Blumenbach's Bildungstreib (generative power) and the Lebenskraft (or Bildungskraft). :...the life of the universe splits into two principles ‚Äì the one transcendent and intellectual (¬´ an animalish, sentient and intellectual nature, or a conscious soul and mind, that presided over the whole world ¬ª), the other immanent and devoid of perception (¬´ a certain plastic nature, or spermatic principle which was properly the fate of all things ¬ª) The essence of atheism for Cudworth was the view that matter was self-active and self-sufficient, whereas for Cudworth the plastic power was unsentient and under the direct control of the universal Mind or Logos. For him atheism, whether mechanical or material could not solve the \\"phenomenon of nature.\\" Henry More argued that atheism made each substance independent and self-acting such that it 'deified' matter. Cudworth argued that materialism/mechanism reduced \\"substance to a corporeal entity, its activity to causal determinism, and each single thing to fleeting appearances in a system dominated by material necessity.\\" Cudworth had the idea of a general plastic nature of the world, containing natural laws to keep all of nature, inert and vital in orderly motion, and particular plastic natures in particular entities, which serve as 'Inward Principles' of growth and motion, but ascribes it to the Platonic tradition: :The Platonists seem to affirm both these together, namely that there is a Plastick Nature lodged in all particular Souls of Animals, Brutes, and Men, and also that there is a Plastick or Spermatick Principle of the whole Universe distinct from the Higher Mundane Soul, though subordinate to it.(Cudworth, TIS, p. 165) Further, Cudsworth's plastic principle was also a functional polarity. As he wrote: :The Seminary Reason or Plastick Nature of the Universe opposing the Parts to one another and making them severally Indigent, produces by that means War and Contention. And therefore though it be One, yet notwithstanding it consists of Different and Contrary things. For there being Hostility in its Parts, it is nevertheless Friendly and Agreeable in the Whole; after the same manner as in a Dramatick Poem, Clashings and Contentions are reconciled into one Harmony. And therefore the Seminary or Plastick Nature of the World, may fitly be resembled to the Harmony of Disagreeing things. As another historian notes in conclusion, \\"Cudworth‚Äôs theory of plastic natures is offered as an alternative to the interpretation of all of nature as either governed by blind chance, or, on his understanding of the Malebranchean view, as micro-managed by God.\\"  Plastic Principle and mind  Cudworth's plastic principle also involves a theory of mind that is active, that is, God or the Supreme Mind is \\"the spermatic reason\\" which gives rise to individual mind and reason. Human mind can also create, and has access to spiritual or super-sensible 'Ideas' in the Platonic sense. Cudworth challenged Hobbesian determinism in arguing that will is not distinct from reason, but a power to act that is internal, and therefore, the voluntary will function involves self-determination, not external compulsion, though we have the power to act either in accordance with God's will or not. Cudworth's 'hegemonikon' (taken from Stoicism) is a function within the soul that combines the higher functions of the soul (voluntary will and reason) on the one hand with the lower animal functions (instinct), and also constitutes the whole person, thus bridging the Cartesian dualism of body and soul or psyche and soma. This idea provided the basis for a concept of self-awareness and identity of an individual that is self- directed and autonomous, an idea that anticipates John Locke.  Influence on Locke  Locke examined how man came to knowledge via stimulus (rather than seeing ideas as inherent), which approach led to his idea of the 'thinking' mind, which is both receptive and pro-active. The first involves receiving sensations ('simple ideas') and the second by reflection ‚Äì \\"observation of its own inner operations\\" (inner sense which leads to complex ideas), with the second activity acting upon the first. Thought is set in motion by outer stimuli which 'simple ideas' are taken up by the mind's self-activity, an \\"active power\\" such that the outer world can only be real-ized as action (natural cause) by the activity of consciousness. Locke also took the issue of life as lying not in substance but in the capacity of the self for consciousness, to be able to organize (associate) disparate events, that is to participate life by means of the sense experiences, which have the capacity to produce every kind of experience in consciousness. These ideas of Locke were taken over by Fichte and influenced German Romantic science and medicine. (See Romantic medicine and Brunonian system of medicine). Thomas Reid and his \\"Common Sense\\" philosophy, was also influenced by Cudworth, taking his influence into the Scottish Enlightenment. Berkeley later developed the idea of a plastic life principle with his idea of an 'aether' or 'aetherial medium' that causes 'vibrations' that animate all living beings. For Berkeley, it is the very nature of this medium that generates the 'attractions' of entities to each other. :The refraction of light is also thought to proceed from the different density and elastic force of this √¶thereal medium in different places. The vibrations of this medium, alternately concurring with or obstructing the motions of the rays of light, are supposed to produce the fits of easy reflection and transmission. Light by the vibrations of this medium is thought to communicate heat to bodies. Animal motion and sensation are also accounted for by the vibrating motions of this √¶thereal medium, propagated through the solid capillaments of the nerves. In a word, all the phenomena and properties of bodies that were before attributed to attraction, upon later thoughts seem ascribed to this √¶ther, together with the various attractions themselves. (Berkeley V 107‚Äì8) Berkeley meant this 'aether' to supplant Newton's gravity as the cause of motion (neither seeing the polarity involved between two forces, as Cudworth had in his plastic principle). However, in Berkeley's conception, aether is both the movement of spirit and the motion of nature. Both Cudworth's views and those of Berkeley were taken up by Coleridge in his metaphor of the eolian harp in his 'Effusion XXXV' as one commentator noted: \\"what we see in the first manuscript is the articulation of Cudworth‚Äôs principle of plastic nature, which is then transformed in the published version into a Berkeleyan expression of the causal agency of motion performed by God‚Äôs immanent activity.\\" Cudworth's idea of the plastic principle and that of mind will also be taken up in a new way in the idea of emergent evolution.

The role of Internet as an unregulated medicine market is the main reasons behind this phenomenon, especially the effectiveness of ‚Äúspam‚Äù as a tool for advertising and promoting these products. Websites and social media are new powerful instruments that organized criminal groups could exploit to conduct their illicit businesses. The spread of this emerging threat worldwide poses a very high risk for the health and safety of unaware consumers. Definition On 29 May 2017, the World Health Assembly hosted by the World Health Organization agreed to have ‚ÄúSubstandard and Falsified (SF) medical products‚Äù as the term to be used in all future documentation on the subject of substandard, spurious, falsified, falsely-labelled and counterfeit (SSFFC) medical products.For more information see also WHO website: http://www.who.int/medicines/regulation/ssffc/en/ Under this definition, a counterfeit medicine is a falsified pharmaceutical product. The term \\"counterfeit\\" is avoided as this is connected to intellectual property rights rather than public health. The meaning associated with ‚Äúcounterfeit medicines‚Äù incorporates various cases that are ascribable to the intentional replication of a product, or product parts, without permission. Role of the Internet The Internet has radically changed the approach towards commerce, drastically modifying also buyers‚Äô attitudes towards the purchase of goods in general. Research has demonstrated that using a computer to fill a prescription online and using online chat groups to learn about health topics are strong independent predictors of prescription drug importation from foreign countries by United States consumers. * Cheap prices are often the primary reason behind consumers‚Äô purchase decisions; * Nonetheless, in the specific case of medicines the level of anonymity granted by the Internet is another driving motive pushing consumers to prefer online consumers (i.e. those people suffering from diseases considered as taboos, such as sexual or psychological illnesses); * Practical convenience is another good reason: pharmaceuticals are delivered directly at consumers‚Äô place; * Consumers can also find online a wider range of products, not always authorized in their own countries (illegal medicines). If on the one side the Internet created new opportunities for consumers, on the other it also represents a new powerful instrument that organized criminals could exploit to conduct their illicit businesses. With the Internet criminals have found an emerging marketplace that could possibly be exploited in many different ways to take advantage of the almost unlimited possibilities offered by cyberspace.For more in-depth information on the role of Internet in counterfeiting see UNICRI (2007), Counterfeiting: a global spread a global threat, chapter 5, p.89, available online at: http://counterfeiting.unicri.it/report2008.php In recent years counterfeiters have been exploiting the Internet as an important channel to offer counterfeit medicines both at the wholesale and at the retail level, often creating an independent distribution process which directly targets distributors and final users. At the wholesale, counterfeiter can exploit distributors‚Äô constant search for low costs products to maximize the profit. For what concerns the retail level, counterfeiters deceive consumers both with low prices and by sending a constant stream of spam messages to their e-mail inboxes. It is clear that the development of new communication technologies and the possibility of exploiting the massive Internet market, has unwillingly favored illegal activities. E-pharmacies Browsing through the Internet, it is easy to hit on online pharmacies that operate according to the regulations and with transparency. For them, criminals are harsh unscrupulous competitors who advertise fake drugs and put at risk the reputation of all online pharmacies which operate honestly. However, the Internet nowadays plays a significant role in the worldwide diffusion of counterfeit pharmaceutical products. To support the business of legal online pharmacies, some institutions (for instance in the U.S.) developed an accreditation system for both online pharmacies connected with territorial ones and for those only operating through the Internet. Main limits concerning these systems are: the official seals of these institutions, to be posted on pharmacies website as a warrantee, can be roughly imitated; these institutions operate at the national level and, due to the different domestic laws of the countries, it is difficult for any of them to provide customers with reliable information concerning the quality of pharmaceuticals available online. An overview of the various typologies of illicit e-pharmacies is now presented, basically focused on rogue and fake e-pharmacies.See also AIFA-EDQM (2011), \\"Counterfeit Medical Products and Similar Crimes. Risk Communication\\" Rogue e-pharmacies are those that not adhere to accepted standards of medicine and/or pharmacy practice, including standards of safety, thus violating regulations, and those that engage in fraudulent and deceptive business practices. They sell counterfeit pharmaceuticals through ad hoc designed websites which pretend authenticity and often contain features which aim to imitate legitimate ones. The impact of illicit e-pharmacies should not be underestimated: sewage epidemiology showed that >60% of the consumed sildenafil in the Netherlands was obtained from illegal sources. The consumers still seem unable to grasp the risks associated with this particular issue. This happens also because the issue of online sales of counterfeit medicines does not seem to receive due attention by the media. On the other side, through fake e-pharmacies cyber criminals do not really sell medicines, but only use them as baits to defraud online buyers, as in the case of ID theft and credit card cloning. The scheme implies a spider- web composed of numerous websites aiming to attract victims. The goal is to infect the computers of the latter with a virus to steal valuable data. Both types of deceptive e-pharmacies - rogue and fake ones - are often efficiently promoted by spam messages, which work even better during times of health crisis, when people go into frenzy over certain types of medicines and when there is a surge of cyber criminals seeking to cash in on the pandemic. Deceiving strategies and tools used by criminals The exploitation of the Internet by criminals caused the spread of uncontrolled and unverified pieces of information and products. Internet search engines, for instance, unwillingly contribute to keep illegal e-pharmacies in business. The struggle against rogue and fake online pharmacies requires combined efforts at different levels. Besides the already mentioned ‚Äúattractive factors‚Äù. such as lower prices and anonymity, counterfeiters also use a variety of deceiving methods that are based on the fact that the potential buyers will never have the possibility to verify the authenticity of what is presented in the fake website. One of these elements is the logos of genuine online pharmacies, or the approval seal of controlling authorities. Moreover, to reassure potential consumers very often it is requested a medical prescription, as a requisite to purchase the online medicines. Thanks to these strategies, the phenomenon of counterfeit medicines sold online is more and more increasing. According to the EAASMEAASM (2011), When is a medicine not a medicine?, online at http://www.eaasm.eu/ (European Alliance for Access to safe Medicines) 6 times out of 10, medicines bought online turned to be fakes. International cooperation With the launch of Operation PangeaINTERPOL, http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Pharmaceutical-crime/Operations/Operation- Pangea in 2008, for the first time illegal online pharmacies were targeted at the international level. In particular, the operation targeted three main components used by illegal websites: the ISP (Internet Service Provider), the payment systems and the delivery service. Along the years the operation gained notable momentum as the number of the participating countries rose from 10 to more than 80 in 2011. The four operations Pangea carried out between 2008 and 2011 led to always increasing number of arrests and seizures all around the world. In 2011 Pangea IV was the largest operation of its kind, involving 165 agencies and leading to the seizure of 2.4 million illicit and counterfeit pills originating from 43 countries; the shutting down of 13,500 websites and the inspection of 45,000 packages. Due to the almost unlimited possibilities offered by cyberspace, purchasing pharmaceuticals over the Internet is easy while, on the contrary, tracing the various phases within the distribution chain can be difficult. It is for this reason that cooperation among different law enforcement agencies in different countries becomes essential. Role of spam Another interesting element to be analyzed is the role of spamming, to present how criminals are able to increase the possibility of success of their deceiving actions by reaching a greater number of potential victims and advertise their products. The term spam is used to describe the abuse of electronic messaging systems in order to indiscriminately send unsolicited bulk messages. The term unsolicited refers to the fact that the message is sent without a verifiable permission granted by the recipient. A message is considered bulk when it is sent as part of a larger collection of messages, all of which have an identical content. Spam is a problem of consent, rather than content. This is a significant element to take into consideration, as attempts to regulate contents of e-mail messages risk to contribute undermining the freedom of speech instead of efficiently fighting the phenomenon of spamming. 92% to 96% of e-mails received by most organizations are spam.FIRSTBROOK P. (2007), \\"Benchmarking Anti-spam Effectiveness\\", Gartner, September 18th, Securing the Network from Spam, Malware and other Threats. A Strategic Overview Featuring Gartner Content, 3rd issue, Clearswift, available online: http://www.clearswift.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/3674/Clearswift_issue3.pdf Spam volumes around the world reach about 250 billion messages a day, that is to say almost 40 spam e-mail messages a day for each woman, man and child in the world.\\"Spam, a lot\\", The New York Times, published 13 January 2011. Article available here: https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/opinion/14fri4.html?_r=1&ref;=spamelectronicmail As it is a cheap and anonymous way to promote products on the Internet and since it also allows reaching a large number of people all over the world, spamming represents a very powerful advertising instrument. It is therefore one of the favorite ways used by organized crime to advertise their illegal activities and illicit products. Online trade of counterfeit pharmaceuticals does not escape the rule and medicines are by all means among the most spammed online products. In particular, in some cases it is particular easy for spammers to take advantage of consumers‚Äô weaknesses. Some of the steps taken by organized criminals to make their operation effective are now presented. * Once spammers have decided the product they want to illicit advertise ‚Äì i.e. the medicine or a series of medicines ‚Äì their next step is to reach an agreement with a website dealing with that type of medicines. The lists with e-mail addresses to be used as spam recipients are commonly sold between crackers and spammers. Such lists contain million of e-mail addresses, most of which are verified and known to be working. * To avoid anti-spam filters, based on a list of ‚Äúdirty words‚Äù, the junk e-mails dealing with medicines could simply just contain an image. Since the filters are also designed to protect from certain types of images, the spammers have learnt how to create pictures which do not come out as jpeg files or similar thus being able to elude filters once again. * As last step, the spammer only requires a software designed to send bulk e-mails (i.e. Dark Mailer) In the past years several companies settled a series of actions against spammers. The various ‚Äújoint actions‚Äù put in place are an important sign of the determination of the private sector to stop the misuse of the Internet for illegal purposes, nevertheless there are thousand of other smaller companies dealing with spamming on a daily basis that are unable to dispose of such amount of technological, financial and human resources to get engaged in such a fight. Involvement of organized crime The interest of organized crime towards the illicit trafficking of counterfeit medicines is clearly demonstrated by figures.For more information on organized crime involvement in counterfeiting activities see also UNICRI (2007), Counterfeiting: a global spread a global threat, chapter 6, p. 103 For instance, a pill of ecstasy costs between ‚Ç¨0.20 and ‚Ç¨0.30 and it is generally sold at ‚Ç¨5. A Viagra pill costs around ‚Ç¨0.15 and it is sold via an illicit website at around 8 to ‚Ç¨10. A kilo of counterfeit Viagra pills (1,700 units) costs ‚Ç¨255 and the retail value is from 13,600 to ‚Ç¨17,000. Organized crime is very much involved in the activity of many rogue and fake e-pharmacies all over the Internet, also through the spamming activity. Spamming is usually part of a wider criminal scheme: spam is a powerful advertising tool therefore organized criminals use it in order to expand their market. In this regard organized crime could rather be seen as a veritable illicit enterprise in which spammers hold the role of a sort of an advertising department. Criminal operations over the Internet are clearly facilitated by the fact that it is indeed easy to register a domain name and to set up a website in a country, to create a back office in another one and to install an online shop in a third country, especially if one considers that many criminal groups operating at the transnational level already have established alliances and operate in several countries. Once the online shop is operational, it could as well easily direct payments to a fourth country and eventually invest the profits in a tax haven. Moreover, very often, in order to further confuse investigators, money is transferred between a chain of bank accounts, creating a smoke-screen which makes investigations more difficult.

The film features Shahid Kapoor and Ileana D'Cruz in the lead roles, and was released on 20 September 2013 to a mixed to positive response from critics. It is loosely based on 1989's movie Guru starring Mithun, Sridevi, Shakti Kapoor in which Mithun also pretends to be police inspector and accidentally catches the criminals of a specific gang on different occasions whereas in reality he doesn't get selected for the police job due to a corrupt police officer played by Yunus Parvez. Plot Savitri Rao (Padmini Kolhapure), a widow, hopes that her only son, Vishwas (Shahid Kapoor) will grow up to be a brave Inspector. But Vishwas wants to become an actor. Dressed as a Police Inspector for a photo shoot, he meets social worker Kajal (Ileana D'Cruz) during a car chase. Kajal mistakes him as an inspector and thanks him for helping her catch the goons, while Vishwas plays along. He is mistakenly published in the newspaper as an Inspector, which Savitri sees. She arrives in Mumbai to see her dream come true, and circumstances lead Vishwas to carry on his lie not only to Kajal, but also to his mother. While shooting for a film, Vishwas's mother comes to know that he is not an inspector. She faints and is admitted in the hospital, where the doctor tells him that she needs to be operated and the amount required is 1 million. He agrees to work for Gundappa (Saurabh Shukla) (the boss of the goons Vishwas and Kajal caught) for money where he needs to bring a CD for them. While escaping after getting the CD he is caught by police and accidentally shoots two police officers. Since he is now a murderer, he is left with no choice but to join Gundappa's gang. Meanwhile, Kajal, who is under the impression that Vishwas has gone bad, along with some men plans to save him from doing any crime. So they go to the gangs den purposely and tells the foolish Gundappa that she came to marry Vishwas. Hence, creating a confusion so that Gundappa leaves Vishwas. On the other hand, Joint Commissioner (Darshan Jariwala) (who was also kidnapped) tells Savitri that Vishwas is actually not doing any crime but is working for the police. Kajal learns this from Savitri later and goes to apologise to Vishwas for misunderstanding him. Not knowing that they are being watched on CCTV, she apologises to Vishwas and leaks details of his plans. Somehow, Vishwas and his mates are able to flee. But his mother and Kajal are held by Napoleon (Mukesh Tiwari) (the ultimate Don, boss of Gundappa). After fighting the goons, Vishwas hands over Napoleon (who is revealed to be his own father) to the police and tells everyone that he will become a police officer as they are real life heroes. He did all the filmy actions as a fake police officer and now wants to be a real police man and do his duty for his country. His mother's dream is finally fulfilled.

Other than the casting and genre, the makers refused to divulge further details. In early August 2012, it was confirmed by director Rajkumar Santoshi that he had been offered the film along with actor Arpit Sharma and that he had been in talks for the previous six months. Soon after, when asked, Kapoor confirmed he had not yet signed on for the film, but was on the verge of doing so. It was also reported at the time that actress Diana Penty had been signed on as the female lead, though Ileana D'Cruz later replaced her. Actress Padmini Kolhapure has been signed on to play the role of Kapoor's mother in the film. It was later revealed that newcomer Deepika Kamainah will play an important role alongside Shahid Kapoor and Ileana D'Cruz. Music The songs were composed by Pritam, with lyrics penned by Irshad Kamil and Amitabh Bhattacharya. The first song, \\"Tu Mere Agal Bagal Hai\\", was released on 26 July.

Another Version of the song was sung by Shefali Alvares and Nakash Aziz but it was not included in the official jukebox. Songs are arranged by Vishal S. The film score was composed by Raju Singh. Filming The film was expected to begin shooting in November 2012 after Kapoor completed Maneesh Sharma's next project for Yash Raj Films, but the actor opted out of that film due to other commitments. Shahid Kapoor announced via Twitter that filming began on 2 November 2012. The film was expected to be completed by February 2013 but due to delay issues it was completed in March 2013. Critical response =India= Taran Adarsh gave the film 3.5/5 and wrote, \\"Phata Poster Nikhla Hero brings back memories of old-fashioned comic entertainers. There's not much of a plot here, but you go with the flow without making much effort. You laugh, celebrate the silly gags and by the time the story reaches its conclusion, you realize that the film has won you over with its unfussy plot and basic characters, who don't have a serious bone in their body. On the whole, Phata Poster Nikhla Hero is an entertainer all the way. If you relished Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani from the team of Taurani and Santoshi, chances are you will also lap up this vibrant, kaleidoscopic, light-hearted entertainer.\\" Madureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India gave the film 3.5 and felt, \\"The first half offers loads of cackles, chuckles, witticisms and spoofy scenes. Post-interval the comedy collapses for a bit with forced OTT drama, khaali-peeli action, and too many song breaks, but makes a comeback with delightfully funny moments. This one's worth it for the 'howlarity' of it all. And Shahid in his element. Note: You may not like this film if you don't have a taste for silly humour & mindless gags!\\" Faheem Ruhani of India Today gave the film 3 and judged, \\"Santoshi as writer, director and the dialogue writer is in good form. He would have been terrific if could have captured your interest in the same way as he did in the first half of the film. Still, the film is worth more than a few laughs. More because of the way the director spoofs Bollywood's tried and tested conventions and the jokes he cracks at the expense of an industry he is only too familiar with.\\" Rummana Ahmed of Yahoo! Movies awarded the film 3 stars and summarised, \\"Phata Poster Nikhla Hero will entertain if you are willing to overlook its little indulgences.\\" References External links * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 action comedy films Category:Films directed by Rajkumar Santoshi Category:Films featuring songs by Pritam Category:Indian films Category:Fictional portrayals of the Maharashtra Police Category:Films featuring an item number Category:Indian action comedy films Category:2010s Hindi-language films Category:2013 comedy films ","title":"Phata Poster Nikhla Hero"},{"id":"36607271","text":"The Blackburn-Walker biplane was a pioneer aeroplane built in Great Britain in 1909 by Harold BlackburnHarold Blackburn was unrelated to aviation pioneer Robert Blackburn.

It is not known whether it actually flew.Philip Jarrett, Lost and Found, The Aeroplane, June 2011, p. 50. Development The Blackburn-Walker biplane was a tailless three-bay tandem pusher craft with a canard elevator and the engine in front of its two occupants, which was designed and built by Harold Blackburn and Albert Walker in 1909. The placement of the engine ahead of the wing leading edge was unusual, with a long driveshaft passing between the two occupants to the two-bladed pusher propeller. The flywheel was extensively drilled for lightness. A precarious step below the engine allowed access to the crank handle and radiator. Lateral control was provided by twin narrow- chord rudders between the upper and lower planes. The Blackburn-Walker biplane in its modified configuration with increased wing area.

Given that Handley Page supplied components to the nascent aviation industry the latter seems more likely. It would appear that the original configuration was not successful as by 1910 the machine sported large leading-edge extensions on both upper and lower wings to provide increased lift.

In 1823 he accompanied Sir Charles Stuart de Rothesay on a diplomatic mission to Portugal and Brazil. Many of the drawings he made on the journey were shown at the British Institution in 1828. He became an associate in of the Royal Academy in 1837, and a full academician in 1845.

It provides an optional sound server and a documented application programming interface to access either the server or the audio and MIDI hardware in a uniform way. sndio is designed to work for desktop applications, but pays special attention to synchronization mechanisms and reliability required by music applications. Features The audio and MIDI server is the main component of sndio. It aims to fill the gap between programs requirements and the bare hardware as exposed by operating system device drivers. This includes: * perform re-sampling and format conversions; for instance to allow a program that requires 44.1 kHz sample frequency to use a device that supports 48 kHz only. * mix and route the sound of multiple programs; this allows multiple programs to use the audio device concurrently. * split an audio device into sub-devices, for instance allowing one program to use the front speakers and another program to use the rear speakers as they were independent simple stereo devices. * allow one program to record what other programs play. * control the volume. * route audio and MIDI data through the network; this allows programs running on one computer to use the sound card of another computer. * route MIDI data between programs, allowing one program to send MIDI data to another program as it was a hardware MIDI port. For instance for a MIDI sequencer to control a soft synthesizer. * start, stop and relocate synchronously a group of audio programs allowing multiple small programs to work together. This can be controlled through standard MIDI Machine Control (MMC) protocol, for instance from within a MIDI sequencer. * expose the sound card clock as MIDI timecode (MTC), allowing MIDI programs (e.g. sequencers) or MIDI hardware to be synchronized to audio streams. The last few points are hooks in the sound server aiming to improve interoperability between audio and MIDI programs. The use of standard MIDI protocols for volume and synchronization control enables interoperability with MIDI software or hardware connected to a computer.

As of 1999 it had a population of 3,448. History Falisolle was one of the possessions which were ceded around 650 CE to the monastery of Fosses by Itta, the widow of the Mayor of the Pepin of Landen Palace. The locality remained in the hands of the group until the end of the Ancien R√©gime and designated a dependency of Li√®ge. The advowson rights belonged to the lord of Morialm√©. This advow protected and defended the community, especially religious institutions, which in turn provided the advow with a portion of their property or estate rights. In 1219 CE, Arnold of Morialm√© consolidated his privileges in Falisolle, Vitrival and Auvelais-le-Voisin in his position as advow; At the time representing one- third of the fees paid if he was called upon to collect. A 15th century record states that the Falisolle advow also benefited from the assize's taille, although he did not have a judicial role. Of those who lived in Falisolle, the Count retained right of tax and property, municipal duties and horse charges. During the creation of new bishoprics in 1559, Falisolle remained part of Liege.

The album was released on August 28, 2012 through Good Fight Entertainment and E1 Music. One Wing has been described by the band as being their \\"weirdest\\" release to date. The album debuted at number 85 on the Billboard 200, their highest position so far. Writing and recording One Wing was recorded with Matt Goldman‚Äîwho has produced all of The Chariot's albums to date‚Äîat his studio in Atlanta, Georgia. Vocalist Josh Scogin said his friendship with Goldman and Goldman's long-standing history with the band factored into their decision to work with him again. Scogin also said, \\"The producer should be there to help us with our ideas, so with Goldman, he always has good ideas but is also always totally down with us doing weird, goofy stuff that may or may not be a good idea.\\" The recording process began in May 2012, and the group attempted to get Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan to participate to some degree by sending him a message over Twitter, although Corgan did not end up participating. The Chariot scheduled time to record One Wing for three weeks, followed by one week of mixing. Scogin said this is the ideal amount of time to record as too much time causes the band to over-think things, but too little time will cause the band to \\"start to agree to anything.\\" One Wing marks the first Chariot album not to feature longtime bassist Jon Kindler since The Fiancee in 2007. The bass on the album is performed by both guitarists, Stephen Harrison and Brandon Henderson. The band continued on as a four-piece; their live performance set-up involved the six- string guitarists utilizing bass amps and octave pedals in addition to their regular equipment. Release One Wing was co-released in the US on August 28, 2012 through Good Fight Entertainment, who previously released The Chariot's last album Long Live in 2010, and major label E1 Music. The Chariot also signed a deal with Season of Mist to distribute the album throughout Europe on September 21, 2012. The song \\"In\\" was available for online streaming on August 16, 2012.

Life Han China in the 190s. Gao You served in the administration of Cao Cao's territory, which later became the Kingdom of Wei. Gao You was born in Zhuo Commandery Zhu≈çj√πn; present-day Zhuozhou, Hebei). around 168. He studied with one of the area's pre√´minent scholars at the time, Lu Zhi. Lu was known for his work with texts concerning Chinese rituals and for his assistance in compiling the History of the Eastern Han D≈çngguƒÅn H√†nj√¨). His other students included Liu Bei, the future king of Shu, and Gongsun Zan, another regional warlord of the era.. Gao's schooling was interrupted by the Yellow Turban Rebellion in 184. Gao was working in Xuchang in the Capital Construction Office in 205 when he received his first post as magistrate of Puyang in the Eastern Commandery D≈çngj√πn). This was about south of the location of the present county-level city of Puyang in Henan. He later held some other mid-level appointments under Cao Cao, who ruled northern China in the name of the Han emperor until his death in 220. Gao died in 212. Works Gao's work dates mostly to the Jian'an Era (196‚Äì220) of the Xian Emperor, the last emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty. Gao wrote commentaries on the Spring and Autumn Annals ordered by L√º Buwei; the Classics of Filial Piety. and of Mountains and Seas; the Huainanzi; The Strategies of the Warring States;. Discourse Weighed in the Balance; and the collected works of the philosopher Mencius.. Gao began his Notes on the Huainanzi Hu√°in√°nzi Zh√π). while studying under Lu and then completed his full commentary in 212. The Huainanzi had become important by his time because it was used to \\"verify\\" or \\"test\\" the genuineness of editions and commentaries of other classics. Charles Le Blanc argues that the phrasing of Gao's preface to his edition of the Huainanzi indicates that still had notes from his former teacher to consult; he also argues that Gao's commentary presumably incorporates the highlights of the otherwise lost work by Lu's own teacher Ma Rong. By the time he finished his work on the Huainanzi, Gao had also already completed his notes on the Classic of Filial Piety and the collected works of Mencius. The latter is now lost. Gao wrote his commentary on Master L√º's Spring and Autumn Annals next, presumably under the influence of Lu's own work on that text. Most of his preface consists of a biography of its chief editor, the Qin chancellor L√º Buwei. This account mostly repeats the biography of L√º found in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian. He defends the work's importance‚Äîequating it to Liu An's Huainanzi, Yang Xiong's Model Sayings, and the collected works of Xun Kuang and Mencius‚Äîby reference to its inclusion in the official bibliographies compiled by Liu Xiang and Liu Xin. Gao's commentary on the Strategies of the Warring States appears to have been its first. It is now lost, except for the parts that were included in the later Song-era commentary by Yao Hong. Legacy Current editions of the Huainanzi derive in part from copies of Gao's commentaries on it. He commented on all 21 chapters of the original text, but only 13 survive in full. Although the authenticity and completeness of the eight chapters now taken from Xu Shen's alleged commentary are both questioned, Gao's chapters are thought to represent survivals of a genuine copy of the original text. The sinologist Victor Mair considers Gao You responsible for the current organization of the Strategies of the Warring States. Gao's commentaries on the Huainanzi and Master L√º's Spring and Autumn Annals include numerous asides on the pronunciation of certain characters, particularly in his local dialect. His notes on the Huainanzi also includes material on the peculiarities of the usual dialect in the former area of Chu. Baxter and Sagart have used some of these notes in their reconstruction of the pronunciation of old Chinese. Gao's note that his copy of Master L√º's Spring and Autumn Annals, which he considered in \\"poor condition\\", consisted of 173,054 characters is significant to scholarship concerning that text, since it makes his edition about a third longer than any currently existing.

Executive producer, Richard Jasek, revealed the storyline during a July 2012 interview, stating that the consequences would last for the rest of the year. It was later announced that the storyline would focus on two major causes of road fatalities and injuries among young Australian drivers ‚Äì distraction and the overloading of cars. In the \\"Ramsay Street crash\\" it is peer pressure that decides the character's fate. The cast and crew filmed the crash scenes over two nights at a driver training centre in Melbourne. Planning for the shoot began six weeks beforehand and multiple cameras were used to catch the various angles of the crash. A promotional trailer for the storyline was released on 27 July. The plot saw the teenage characters; Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith), Chris Pappas (James Mason), Ed Lee (Sebastian Gregory), Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) heading to a concert in the city, initially unaware that Sophie Ramsay (Kaiya Jones) has hidden herself in the boot of the car. After discovering Sophie, Chris reluctantly agrees to let her come with them. An argument breaks out, distracting Chris and eventually causing him to lose control of the overloaded car. Andrew is knocked unconscious and Sophie is thrown from the car, while passing Doctor Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) suffers a career-ending injury to his hand. Later developments saw Chris being sued by Sophie's uncle and Andrew diagnosed with epilepsy. Reception for the \\"Ramsay Street crash\\" was positive, with one critic calling it the most dramatic storyline of the year. Plot On his birthday, Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) receives two cheques for the sale of a mobile app that he helped create along with Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) and Ed Lee (Sebastian Gregory). Andrew attempts to tell Natasha that he sold the app without her knowledge, but decides to wait until the following day. Natasha, Chris Pappas (James Mason) and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) give Andrew tickets to see The Jezabels in the city that night. Sophie Ramsay (Kaiya Jones) also plans to attend the concert, but her uncle, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), forbids her from going because she has not done her homework. Andrew and his friends meet outside in Ramsay Street to put their belongings in Chris' car and Andrew expresses his unhappiness that Ed is coming along. While the group talk, Sophie sneaks out of her house and gets into the boot of Chris' car unseen. During the journey, a phone begins ringing, but the group cannot work out whose it is. Ed believes the ringing is coming from the boot, so Chris pulls over to the side of the road. The group discover Sophie in the boot and try and work out what to do with her. Summer suggests that Chris takes her home, while Ed offers to call a taxi and go back with her. Andrew, desperate not to miss the concert, asks Chris to take her in the car, despite knowing that there is not a spare seatbelt. Chris reluctantly agrees and Sophie sits on Summer's lap. Summer asks what time The Jezabels are on stage and Andrew mentions that he wrote it down on his ticket, which is in his wallet inside Summer's bag. As Summer searches for the ticket, she finds the two cheques inside and asks Andrew about them. He tries to get his wallet back, but Summer discovers the cheques are worth $25,000 and Natasha realises he has sold the app. An argument breaks out between Natasha and Andrew, which Summer and Ed join in on. Ed asks Andrew how he sold the app without Natasha's signature and they all realise that he forged it. Chris struggles to stay focused and asks everyone to calm down, while Natasha wants him to stop the car. She then decides to call the police and Andrew reaches back to stop her, but jostles Chris' arm causing him to lose control of the car. It runs off the road and hits an embankment, before flipping over and coming to a rest upside down. Natasha pulls Ed from the wreckage, while Chris helps a shocked Summer out and then returns to check an unconscious Andrew. On his way home, Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) drives past the crash site and is flagged down by Natasha. He calls an ambulance and begins assessing everyone. Rhys tells Chris to keep the others warm and awake. While he is helping Andrew, Rhys cuts his hand on the wreckage. Sophie lies unseen and unconscious in the grass, a few yards from the car. After the ambulances take the others to the hospital, Rhys and a police officer hear a phone ringing and go looking for it. Rhys then finds Sophie and she is rushed to the hospital, where Paul and her sister, Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), are waiting. Natasha, Summer and Chris are treated for minor injuries, while Andrew recovers from a serious head injury. Ed has fractured his collarbone and Sophie has a fractured pelvis and internal injuries. Rhys hand is treated by Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) and he tells his girlfriend, Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata), that their trip to Japan is off. Ed wakes up with Natasha by his side and they share their first kiss. Sophie's heart stops, but Karl manages to stabilise her. He then tells Kate and Paul to prepare themselves for the worst. Chris has his driver's license suspended and Paul later announces that he is suing him. Natasha and Summer state that they blame Andrew for the crash and he is ostracised from the group. Chris attends court where he is given a fine and told that his license will be suspended for six months. He goes to visit Sophie and tells Paul that he will not be pushed around by him, before breaking down at her bedside. Karl realises that Summer has been traumatised by the crash and helps her out by encouraging her to get in another car. He later tells a devastated Rhys that he has suffered severe nerve damage to his hand, as a result of the cut, and there is only a five per cent chance of a full recovery. Andrew suffers from headaches, dizziness and blackouts following the crash. He eventually seeks help and is diagnosed with epilepsy, which he keeps a secret from his friends and family. A few days after she wakes up, Paul sends Sophie to a rehab clinic in Sydney. Andrew purchases some medication online to control his epilepsy symptoms, which Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) advises him against taking. Chris is asked by his lawyer to collect witness statements from everyone involved in the crash, but Andrew refuses to give him one. However, Paul is forced to call off the lawsuit when Andrew admits that the crash was his fault. He makes up with Chris, while Summer and Natasha initially keep their distance. Sophie returns from rehab and is able to walk with the help of crutches, but she struggles to be around her friends. She later admits to Chris that she blames herself for the accident, but he states that it was not her fault. Months later, Chris suffers flashbacks to the crash, causing him to admit that he is struggling to get back behind the wheel. Production =Announcement and conception= The executive producer of Neighbours, Richard Jasek, teased the crash storyline during a July 2012 interview with Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly. Jasek stated that the show had \\"a dramatic storyline coming up\\", which would have consequences that last for the rest of the year. He told Kilkelly, \\"All I can say is 'the gang shouldn't have gone out that night‚Ä¶'\\" A writer for Channel 5's Neighbours website later revealed that the storyline would highlight \\"two of the major causes of road fatalities and injuries among young Australian drivers ‚Äì distraction and overloading cars.\\" Jasek told the writer that when the team were plotting the story, they were surprised to learn how common it is for younger drivers to be persuaded into allowing more passengers in the car than legally allowed and how easily they are distracted. In the show's storyline it is peer pressure that decides the character's fate. Jasek explained \\"Ironically the character who is driving is the most responsible of all our teens but succumbs to pressure to allow one too many passengers. It is one of those decisions that at the time seems quite harmless because they're not traveling very far but like real life situations, distance has nothing to do with it.\\" =Filming= Jasek revealed to TV Week's Jackie Brygel that planning for the \\"dramatic\\" episodes began six weeks before the crash scenes were filmed. The shoot took sixteen hours to complete and the scenes were filmed over two nights at Melbourne's METEC Driver Training Centre. James Mason (Chris Pappas) told Brygel that the crew put in a lot of time and effort into getting the scenes right. He revealed that when scenes are usually filmed on location, two cameras are used, but for the crash storyline the crew used five to six cameras at the same time to capture the different angles. He called the shoot \\"fantastic\\" and later explained to Inside Soap's Sarah Ellis, \\"It looked like a movie set, with lots of emergency vehicles, and it was shot at night so the place was lit up like a Christmas tree. We used two identical cars, since we had to virtually destroy one of them.\\" A stunt performer who specialises in car crash scenes also worked on the shoot. Jordy Lucas (Summer Hoyland) commented that being off-site was \\"pretty exciting\\" because the cast film everything but the street scenes at the show's Nunawading studio. Jordan Smith (Andrew Robinson) added that filming the scenes affected the cast members, saying \\"It made us all stop and think. I think we all drove home pretty slowly that night!\\" Development James Mason plays Chris Pappas, the driver of the car. To celebrate Andrew Robinson's birthday, the Ramsay Street teens decide to attend a concert in the city. Andrew, Natasha (Valentina Novakovic), Summer and Ed (Sebastian Gregory) get into Chris' car earlier in the evening, unaware that Sophie Ramsay (Kaiya Jones) is hiding in the boot, having rebelled against her uncle's decision to forbid her from attending the concert. Halfway into the journey, the group hear a mysterious ringing coming from the back of the car and when Chris pulls over he discovers Sophie hiding in the boot with her phone. Andrew just wants to get to the concert, so he persuades Chris to let Sophie sit on Summer's lap. Chris \\"reluctantly agrees\\" knowing that she will not have a seat belt on. Mason revealed \\"Chris really is a pretty sensible, straightforward kind of guy who knows the rules - his morals are good. The last things he wants to do is jeopardise anyone's safety by doing something silly. But he gets talked into overloading the car by letting Sophie get in with them. He wants to please his friends and make sure everyone's happy - and it doesn't help that the whole group use a bit of peer pressure to convince him. The others just don't see any danger in what they're doing.\\" Shortly after restarting their journey, a heated argument breaks out between Natasha and Andrew when she learns he has sold their gambling app without her permission. Summer and Ed join in with the argument and there is a lot of shouting. Lucas explained \\"Summer's aware they've overloaded the car, so she wants to keep calm. She can sense Chris is getting stressed by all the yelling, so she's very tense.\\" As Chris tries to concentrate on the road, Andrew accidentally bumps his arm and he suddenly loses control of the car, which swerves, hits an embankment and flips over before coming to a stop. Sophie is critically injured after being thrown from the vehicle, while Andrew has a serious head injury and Ed is also in a bad way. Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) comes across the scene and puts his own life at risk to start \\"frantic\\" rescue efforts. He cuts his hand in the process, but refuses to get it looked when the emergency services arrive. Rhys eventually finds Sophie and when she reaches the hospital, she is rushed into surgery. A writer for Soap World commented that \\"a terrified\\" Natasha is worried Ed will not wake up, before she can tell him she loves him. Mason stated that Chris is wracked with guilt and worried for his friends. Things become worse for him when Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) arrives at the hospital and, after learning his son and niece are in a serious condition, threatens to sue him. Mason revealed that Paul is angry and wants someone to pay for what happened, while Dennis explained \\"Yes, it's typical Paul - someone has to pay and he decides that Chris should take all of the blame before he knows the full story.\\" Chris is questioned by the police about the accident. Summer and Natasha later admit that they blame Andrew for the crash and he is slowly pushed out of the group. Sophie's condition starts to improve, but she faces \\"a long recovery\\" and is sent away to Sydney to receive treatment. The hand injury Rhys sustained forces him to cancel an impending trip to Japan. His girlfriend, Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) persuades him to have his injured hand examined and he has to undergo minor surgery. Rhys later has some tests performed on his hand and is told that he only has a five per cent chance of a full recovery. Barber revealed \\"He is devastated - becoming a surgeon is the most important thing to him and he has no plan B. This is a guy who manipulated himself into the surgical programme, it means that much to him.\\" The crash also affects on Andrew's future when he is diagnosed with epilepsy. Andrew begins displaying \\"worrying neurological symptoms\\" including; dizziness, severe headaches and black outs. Smith told Brygel \\"To start with Andrew just ignores the symptoms. He blames them on the crash. He doesn't want to delve into things. But there comes a point where he can't ignore the symptoms anymore.\\" Despite being urged to tell his family and friends about the diagnosis, Andrew tries to deal with it by himself. When Ed eventually wakes up, Natasha \\"wastes no time\\" in telling him how she really feels about him and they share a kiss. All About Soap's Claire Crick asked \\"Could this tragedy finally being them together properly?\\" Birdy. Promotion and broadcast On 27 July 2012, Neighbours released a promotional trailer featuring the six teen characters for the car crash storyline. Birdy's version of \\"People Help the People\\" accompanied the trailer and the tagline read \\"Soon their lives change...forever.\\" A few days later, Neighbours producers released pictures showing the characters in the aftermath of the accident and filming of the car crash scenes. The storyline began airing from 20 August in Australia and from 17 September in the UK. Reception Jovita O'Shaughnessy received an Australian Director's Guild nomination for Best Direction in a TV Drama Serial for Episode 6472, which featured the aftermath of the crash. Brygel proclaimed that the Ramsay Street crash was \\"undoubtedly the most dramatic and shocking Neighbours storyline of the year so far\\". Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap named the storyline \\"Nightmare on Ramsay Street\\" and called the crash \\"terrifying\\". Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton stated \\"I really enjoyed Neighbours this past week. The crash and the aftermath made for some really strong storytelling and I'm surprised at how prominent Chris has been in the storyline.\\" Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly branded the crash one of the soap's \\"biggest episodes of the year\\". A reporter from the Sunday Mercury said \\"What do we think might happen to a car overloaded with teenagers? It crashes, of course, and Sophie is badly injured.\\" Carena Crawford from All About Soap commented \\"Wow, Neighbours was more than a little bit dramatic today with the big car crash putting Sophie's life in danger ‚Äì will she survive?\\" The writer went on to say that the accident would have \\"far-reaching consequences for everybody\\" and tried to work out who was to blame, before adding \\"Whoever's fault it is, we can't wait to see what happens next!\\" A reporter for the TVTimes stated \\"With more road accidents in this patch of Oz than anywhere else in the world, Sophie is asking for trouble when she piles into Chris's car, which is already overloaded with teenagers thanks to Andrew egging him on.\\" Dianne Butler, writing for news.com.au, thought the police did \\"a half-baked investigation into the car crash\\", enabling Paul to sue Chris. The storyline was included in the Inside Soap Yearbook 2013 as one of \\"The best bits of September\\". It was also named \\"Crash of the month\\". The crash was nominated for Best Storyline in Digital Spy's end of year reader poll for 2012, it received 5.5% of the vote.

The Tequila is produced at Tres Agaves' distillery in the town of Amatit√°n located in Jalisco, Mexico. Tres Agaves Tequilas are made from 100% Blue Agave by a family-owned distillery. Tres Agaves Products Inc. produces three varieties of Tequila: Blanco, Reposado and A√±ejo. Additionally, the company offers four alcohol-free mixer products: Tres Agaves Organic Margarita Mix, Tres Agaves Organic Strawberry Margarita Mix, Tres Agaves Cocktail-Ready Agave Nectar, and Tres Agaves Organic Bloody Mary Mix.Tres Agaves Official Products Page History = The Early Days = Tres Agaves Products LLC. was founded in 2008, at CEO and Founder Barry Augus' dining room table. Along with a small team, Barry wrote the first business plan and the original bottle design. The operation was initially funded by Barry's family inheritance, allowing him and his team to purchase their first Tequila bottle mold. The company started by selling cocktail-ready agave nectar out of Barry's minivan, hand delivering every order. In 2010, the company's first case of Tequila shipped to the US from Mexico and sold just a week later.Tres Agaves Official History Page Their three Tequila varieties were originally crafted at the El Llano distillery ( NOM: 1109) in Jalisco, which began production in 1900.\\"Tequila Academy\\" Online Video Series by Tres Agaves and Portal A Interactive - A Video Adventure into Tequila Launches Tres Agaves' Public Distillery Tours to Mexico Tequila.net NOM Database = 2012 to 2016: Partnership with Trinchero Family Estates = In late 2012, Tres Agaves entered into a sales and marketing partnership with Trinchero Family Estates. The venture made sense both in a business and a cultural sense. The joint venture allowed Trinchero to enter into the spirits business and gave Tres Agaves the ability to focus on product development while Trinchero brought Tres Agaves into more markets through its robust sales and distribution network. Of great importance was the cultural importance of family in both organizations, with Trinchero being the second largest family owned winery in the world, and family and friends having enabled Barry to start and grow his business. = 2016 to Today: The Tres Agaves Distillery = In 2016, Tres Agaves purchased land from the Partida family, Barry having known and worked with David Partida for the last 20 years. The purchase allowed Tres Agaves to control its own destiny, by building a home to bring in complete control of its Tequila production operations and become a cultural site for the company and industry. Located on a plot of land in Amatit√°n, a town minutes outside of the town of Tequila, the Tres Agaves distillery has state-of-the-art production facilities, including a 22-ton autoclave, a four- stage roller mill and stainless steel fermentation tanks. In addition to these, the distillery has traditional production methods on site, including a tahona wheel and a stone horno.  Iliana Partida - Maestra Tequilera  In 2018, Tres Agaves appointed Iliana Partida as master distiller - or Maestra Tequilera - of its new distillery. A member of the Partida family, Iliana was taught by her father to produce Tequila, a tradition of the Partida's spanning four generations. In taking this role, Iliana becomes one of the very few women to be a master distillery in the Tequila industry. In fact, according to the New York Times, there are only 12 other Maestra Tequileras in Mexico at this time.  Going Organic  Tres Agaves has maintained a strong commitment to making the freshest, best tasting Tequila and margaritas. This commitment began with the first bottle of agave syrup, choosing to make it organic, and continued through the entire line of organic cocktail mixers. With the construction of the new distillery, Tres Agaves is able to honor its commitment to organic products and has fully transitioned to producing organic Tequila. This move enhances the flavor by enriching the terroir of Tres Agaves Tequila and matches the growth of consumer preference for organic products in the US. Tres Agaves commits to sustainable growing practices in the Tequila Valley in addition to local and community development and employment.  Product details  = Tequila flavor and aging = Tres Agaves is characterized by a smooth finish, with no harsh \\"burn\\". Unlike more mass- produced Tequilas, however, Tres Agaves actively strives to bring out the strong agave flavors in its products, enabling the true essence of the spirit to shine through - both in its Tequila and its cocktail mixers. By only selecting agaves grown in the Tequila Valley, Tres Agaves Tequila highlights the terroir of its plants: herb and citrus notes. The Blanco is unaged so that the spirit is agave-forward and reflecting the strong terroir of the Tequilla Valley agaves. The Reposado is aged for a minimum of 8 months, producing a delicate balance between the herbaceous and citrus notes of the agaves and the spice and smoother palette stemming from the barrels. The A√±ejo has hints of fruit and herbs like rosemary, but most strongly reflects the smoky sweetness of caramel and butterscotch flavors imparted by the varietal's 18 months in barrel. All Tres Agaves Tequila is distilled only twice to not lose the natural agave flavor, an effect of numerous distillations. = Cocktail Mixes = Beginning with the first organic margarita mix on the market, Tres Agaves has strived to create natural, organic cocktail mixes, giving home cocktail enthusiasts the right tools to make bar-quality drinks at home. Tres Agaves Margarita Mix is made with four simple ingredients, lime juice, agave nectar, water, and vitamin C, and balances the fresh, tart lime flavor with the sweetness of the agave nectar. The Agave Nectar is made with just agave syrup and water, can be substituted wherever a sweetener may be used, and is made to fully dissolve into cold beverages. The Strawberry Margarita Mix can be used with Tequila for margaritas or with vodka to make a delicious strawberry daiquiri. Tres Agaves Bloody Mary Mix is made with a proprietary spice blend and can be used to make a Bloody Mary or a Bloody Maria. Critical reviews Tres Agaves' Tequilas have been evaluated by numerous spirits ratings competitions including the Ultimate Spirits Challenge, the Beverage Testing Institute, TheFiftyBest.com, the International Spirits Challenge and others. Their A√±ejo variety was awarded the Chairman's Trophy at the 2010 Ultimate Spirits Challenge with a score of 97/100. 2010 Ultimate Spirits Challenge Official Results References External links *Tres Agaves Products Inc.

The statue was sculpted prior to the Second World War and was hidden in a quarry during the war years. Other locations were suggested for the statue, including Parliament Square, but it was unveiled opposite the House of Lords in 1947. Description The statue stands high and is made of Portland stone. It is located south of The Lady Chapel, Westminster Abbey and opposite the House of Lords. It is a Grade II listed structure, having become so on 5 February 1970. History The statue on its plinth, with Westminster Abbey in the background It was announced in March 1937 by the Lord Mayor of London that William Reid Dick had been selected as the sculptor of a statue of George V. Giles Gilbert Scott was selected to design the architecture of the plinth. A location in Abingdon Street opposite the House of Lords was announced in October 1937. The construction was organised by the King George V National Memorial Committee. The original design proved controversial and resulted in some criticism: it was to feature an ornate Gothic canopy which critics described as \\"dwarfing\\" the statue itself. Following a public consultation this feature was removed from later designs. The Amenities groups of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords opposed the citing of the statue facing the House of Lords as they were concerned it would lead to the demolition of No. 6 and 7 Old Palace Yard and houses in a nearby street. A model of the statue was exhibited in the Member's tea room of the House of Commons. The Royal Fine Art Commission suggested that the statue should be located in Parliament Square instead of opposite the House of Lords. The construction of the statue took place on Portland prior to the Second World War, but the danger of bringing the statue to London prevented the erection of it until after the war. The carving of the statue actually took place in the Portland quarry from which the stone was produced, and during the war years it was placed inside one of the quarry's tunnels on the Island in order to prevent it from potential damage due to German bombing raids. Following the war it was moved to the Tate Gallery while the statue's site was prepared for it. The statue was placed in the original proposed spot opposite the House of Lords, which required the demolition of No. 5 Old Palace Yard. It was unveiled by King George VI, on 22 October 1947 and was attended by Queen Elizabeth, Queen Mary, and Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. In 1968, the symbol of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament was drawn on the side of the plinth, provoking the question of its removal to be raised by Dudley Smith MP in the House of the Commons.

Biography  Elkus came from a family with a background in music and commerce and received early music training from his mother, Bertha Kahn Elkus. His father, also Albert Elkus, was a business owner and Mayor of Sacramento. He then went on to study with Hugo Mansfeld in Sacramento and San Francisco. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, earning the BLitt and MLitt in 1906 and 1907. While attending the university he gave many public piano recitals throughout the Bay area and northern California, most notably with the Saturday Club of Sacramento. After completing academic studies at UC Berkeley, he went to Berlin to study music theory and composition with Hugo Kaun. He then returned to the Bay area and continued his studies with Oscar Weil. From 1912-14 he went abroad again; in Paris he studied piano with Harold Bauer, in Berlin, he studied piano and composition with Josef Lh√©vinne and Georg Schumann, and in Vienna he studied composition with Carl Prohaska and conducting with Franz Schalk. Professional career On returning to the United States in 1915, Elkus taught at the Jenkins School of Music in Oakland. From 1916-1928 he conducted several choral societies in San Francisco and Sacramento. He was the head of the Theory Department at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music from 1923-5, then again from 1930-37, and finally returned there as the director from 1951-1957. He also taught at Dominican College and Mills College. Elkus had an extensive association with the music department at UC Berkeley, lasting from 1931 to 1959. He became the conductor of the University Symphony Orchestra in 1934. He was chairman there from 1937-1951 and brought in distinguished musicians such as Randall Thompson, Ernest Bloch, Roger Sessions, Arthur Bliss, Manfred Bukofzer, and the Griller Quartet. In 1959 UC Berkeley conferred on Elkus the honorary degree Doctor of Laws. He continued to teach at the Conservatory and give lectures at the University until his death. In honor of Elkus, UC Berkeley annually bestows the Albert Elkus Award to four or five outstanding students from the class that Elkus taught most often, Music 27: Introduction to Music (for non-music majors).  Works  Elkus was prolific as a composer, writing in a post-Brahmsian style, tending towards conservatism but with an emphasis on chromatic harmonics tinged with a dash of Impressionism. He revered Beethoven and remained firmly entrenched in the music of the Romantics. He also had a great love of the music of the Baroque and Renaissance eras, and took a vigorous part in furthering the music of his own time. His 1917 piece Impression from a Greek Tragedy won the Juilliard Award in 1935 and found its way into many orchestra repertoires. He virtually stopped composing once he became chair of the UC Berkeley music department. He was performed by symphonies around the world, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, and London. Elkus was one of the editors of Oscar Weil Letters and Papers (1923), with Flora Arnstein and Stewart Young.

Life  Born in San Francisco, the son of Albert Elkus, he studied composition at University of California, Berkeley (BA 1953) with Charles Cushing and William Denny, at Stanford University (MA 1957) with Ernst Bacon and Leonard Ratner, and at Mills College (1957) with Darius Milhaud. From 1957 to 1973 he taught at Lehigh University and conducted the university band, the Marching 97. In 1979, he became the director of music and chair of humanities at Cape Cod Academy. He was appointed Lecturer in Music and Director of Bands at University of California, Davis in 1993, retiring in 2003. Elkus founded Overland Music Distributors in 1984. They published books and music by varying composers including Elinor Armer, Cushing, and Ali Akbar Khan. He now serves as editorial consultant to Subito Music Corporation, its successor. Elkus has been a guest conductor with concert bands and wind ensembles throughout the USA. In 2002, he was presented with the Edwin Franko Goldman Memorial Citation of the American Bandmasters Association in recognition of his contribution to bands and band music in America.  Works  Elkus has focused on expanding the repertory for concert band; numerous compositions and arrangements for this ensemble have been published and recorded. Elkus has composed over a dozen works for the stage, in addition to incidental music for plays and numbers for musical revues. His two best known are conceived for performance by children: Tom Sawyer (1953) and Treasure Island (1961). In Tom Sawyer, Elkus uses much of Mark Twain‚Äôs original dialogue. The composer‚Äôs intent in this musical adaptation was, like Twain‚Äôs, to ‚Äúremind adults of what they once were and how they thought and felt‚Äù. The musical style is essentially tonal, evoking the work‚Äôs period setting through galops and marches; instrumental interludes are highly programmatic, and choral ensembles make use of original onomatopoeic devices. The music of Treasure Island is more adventurous; colorful hornpipes are used, but the language is richly chromatic and there is considerable rhythmic intensity. Through his editorial work, Elkus has focused on the music of Charles Ives. He is an editor of the Charles Ives Society‚Äôs critical editions of the complete works and has transcribed works of Ives for the U.S. Marine Band. In 1974 he authored the monograph Charles Ives and the American Band Tradition.

The 1st XV currently plays in London NW3 following promotion from Herts/Middlesex1 at the end of the 2019-20 season. History The club was formed in 1970 by their first chairman, Peter Baines. The club formed as an open rugby club with many players joining from the old Electrical Apparatus Company (EAC) rugby club which played off New Barnes Avenue. Initially the club used changing rooms at Westminster Lodge and a rented pitch situated just above the hypocaust in Verulamium Park. The North Western PH (now a block of flats) on the corner of Prospect Road and Holywell Hill provided a club room and meals on match days. In 1976 the club acquired the short term lease from St Albans School for a pitch and clubhouse off Belmont Hill. 1983 saw the club move to their current ground at Boggymead Springs, off Oaklands Lane, at Smallford, obtained on a long term lease from Hertfordshire CC. The clubhouse was officially opened by the England scrum half, Dickie Jeeps, in October that year. Other sports St Albans RFC also hosts Ultimate Frisbee with St Alban Ultimate and recently the Hertfordshire Cheetahs American football team who play in the BAFA National Leagues Division 2 East.

It records the glass making and glass art which started in Glassboro in 1779. The museum was founded in 1979 and its mission is to educate and preserve the heritage of glass manufacturing and glass blowing in South Jersey. Early history In 1779, members of the Stanger family, all glass blowers, left Alloway Township, New Jersey and the Wistar glassworks. Soloman Stanger had found clay, quality sands and adequate Oak wood for the glass furnaces, along with a ready market across the river at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This was near Carpenter‚Äôs Landing close to the narrow Mantua Creek. He purchased 200 acres of land there. The Stangers were German immigrants who had worked in Salem County, New Jersey and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania glass works and were ready to start their own business.Henry Charlton Beck: More Forgotten Towns of Southern New Jersey, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, N.J., 1963, pp. 299-301. See also: Who We Are . Their timing due to the American Revolution was unfortunate because the Stanger Glass Works closed in late 1781 primarily due to inflation of the new American Revolutionary War money, high costs of transportation and being unable to pay off their debts. Post American Revolution Colonels Thomas Heston and Thomas Carpenter purchased the glass blowing equipment in 1786. The Heston- Carpenter Glass Works became financially successful and upon the death of the partners was sold. Over time the once Stanger Glass works later became the Olive Works, the Temperanceville Glass Works, the Harmony Glass Works (by mid 1830), the Whitney Brothers Glass Works in 1838, the Owens Bottle Company by 1922, and finally the Owens Illinois Glass Company circa 1926. The Whitney Brothers Glass work was bought in 1838 by Thomas Whitney the eldest son of Ebenezer Whitney who settled in Glassboro in 1805 due to an accident at sea. Over the next seventy five years the company flourished and at one point had over a thousand workers and thousands of acres of land. Glassboro was once the United States best equipped and extensive glass producing area of the country with the largest variety of colors and styles.Borough of Glassboro: History - The Past . Retrieved August 1, 2012. By the 1930s, plastics had begun to replace glass in the domestic markets. The age of mass production of glass and glass blowing was ending.Cummings, K. 2002. A History of Glassforming. University of Pennsylvania Press Museum On September 23, 1979, the Heritage Glass Museum was founded as a 501c(3) non-profit organization. The current location is at 25 High Street in Glassboro, which is a former Glassboro Title & Trust Company bank building that failed in 1931 due to the Depression. In its last function before the museum was founded, it was the Glassboro Public Library from 1963 to 1979. The land was once part of the original Stanger Glass Works. The Museum has exhibits of historic glass, bottles and animal glass art figurines. It has an extensive library on glass blowing and education. It also loans out items for display at other museums and institutions of learning.

Design and development The aircraft design incorporates a pilot in prone position, retractable tricycle landing gear, folding wings, ballistic recovery parachute system, and electric propulsion motors that rotate to allow limited thrust vectoring. The thrust vectoring is intended to be used in conjunction with Fowler flaps to meet the Part 103's requirement of less than 27.6 MPH stall speed. The target price for the aircraft is approximately $20,000USD. The EMG-5 started construction before March 2012. Flight tests were anticipated to commence in Corning, California in early 2013. The designer of the EMG-5 had based its development under the assumption that the batteries were considered part of the fuel with regard to the FAR 103 regulations and thus not included in the aircraft's maximum empty weight of 254 pounds (115 kg). As the development of the EMG-5 progressed Tangent Aircraft was spending money on research and development at an alarming rate and felt that it was very necessary to get a definitive interpretation from the FAA to ensure that their investment would not be in vain. Unfortunately, the FAA responded that \\"... the weight of [the] batteries must be included when determining the empty weight of the ultralight vehicle and that empty weight must not exceed 254 pounds.\\" As a result, Tangent Aircraft significantly slowed development of the EMG-5 and began developing the EMG-6.

S. University, Vadodara, Gujarat. This 3 day gala, usually held in the month of September, attracts an annual crowd of 22,000 students from Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Started in 2001, Paramarsh is now in its 18 th consecutive year with the distinction of being one of the biggest of its kind in the entire West zone.  Introduction  The logo for Paramarsh The word Paramarsh has its roots in the Sanskrit language, meaning ‚ÄòSupreme Thought‚Äô. The 3-day long festival aims at improving soft skills among students for excellence in the corporate world. Conducted and managed by the budding engineers of M. S. University, Paramarsh is a non-profit organization that intends to inculcate the 7 commandments of corporate excellence: ‚ÄòLeadership‚Äô, ‚ÄòTeam Spirit‚Äô, ‚ÄòSportsmanship‚Äô, ‚ÄòCreativity‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Spirit of Adventure‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe art of Oration‚Äô and the ‚ÄòScience of Deduction‚Äô.  History  The dawn of the new millennium brought about a change in the hiring strategy of companies. The recruiters now focused not only on technical knowledge but also emphasized communication skills, confidence, spontaneous thinking and the capability of working under pressure. An absence of this aptitude would affect the odds of recruitment. Working towards the amelioration of these prowesses, Paramarsh was started by a group of students as an intra-college event with just one event focusing on group discussion. Today, Paramarsh stands prodigious with 18 events under 7 categories which comprise a wide range of events focusing on various soft skills basically required in the corporate and industrial sector. Through the years, Paramarsh has evolved and thrived, surpassing its previous edition by miles. And over this time period, there have been some significant events that have only contributed to the growing popularity of this festival. 2007 saw a guest performance by Gaurav Dagaonkar, the IIM-A graduate of ‚ÄòCollege Days‚Äô fame. In 2008, Ankit Fadia, the bestselling author of ‚ÄòFASTER: 100 ways of improving your digital life‚Äô and subsequent YouTube and MTV shows like ‚ÄòWhat The Hack‚Äô, came to Gujarat for the very first time to conduct a workshop on ‚ÄòEthical hacking‚Äô.

In 2014, the band ‚ÄòAeon of Darkness‚Äô won the battle of bands.  Sanidhya  From 2012, Paramarsh with a clear vision to raise awareness amongst the society stepped forward through ‚ÄòSanidhya-Awareness for Society‚Äô. Sanidhya has taken up the baton of bringing the society in the proximity of several subjects of life that have either been forgotten or are unrealized so far. One of the several such subjects is a Group Discussion. It is one of the most important aspects for the college students to clinch a job. Many students face problems in their Placement Interviews, predominantly due to the lack of Interpersonal skills. Group Discussion forms the crux of the selection criteria, be it B-schools or campus interviews, wherein the students lack in presenting themselves mainly because they have never faced anything similar in their regular academics. But unfortunately, the school students aren‚Äôt even aware of this form of oratory skill. In order to fill this gap, Paramarsh organized an event called ‚ÄòSpeak To Win‚Äô as a part of SANIDHYA, which strived to inculcate this requisite speaking skill in the school students. The seminar explained the importance of presentation skills and group discussion to nearly 2000 students from 10 different schools including English and Gujarati medium- viz. Reliance School, Baroda High School, Zenith School, Ambe Vidyalaya, Tejas Vidyalaya, Jeevan Sadhna, St. Kabir, Maharani School, Bright School (Ambalal Park) and Bright School (V.I.P Complex). In 2013, Paramarsh organized a career counselling session ‚ÄòMy Career, My Choice‚Äô that provided the school students with an opportunity to seek guidance from teachers of various departments having years of experience so as to help them make the right career choice. With colleges offering numerous courses, it is truly confusing to make a choice. But for a student, choosing a career path that is far from ones‚Äô interest and ability can cause dissatisfaction in the long run. Hence choosing the correct career is essential and it was with this in mind that Paramarsh, under the banner of Sanidhya, organized this session. In 2014, we delved deeper into the pitfalls of the recruitment process and conducted a free workshop ‚ÄòClimbing the Corporate Ladder‚Äô wherein corporate trainers provided guidance so as to develop the verbal ability and interview skills of the participants via SWOT analysis and to improve their public speaking skills. On World Environment Day, Paramarsh under the banner of Sanidhya decided to adopt the side dividers of the Akota-Dandia Bridge and plant saplings along the stretch. It was a small initiative to spread awareness on the growing disregard towards the environment and taking a small but firm step towards changing it. The campaign was graced by the honourable Deputy Mayor Mrs Seemaben Mohile. The same year we also conducted an interactive seminar titled ‚ÄòBANKING SIMPLIFIED‚Äô familiarizing the school students with the concept of banking and the frauds related to net banking. They were informed about the workings of an ATM and the whole concept of a credit and debit card. Easy money transactions, the operational plan of bank accounts and new banking technologies were some of the other topics that were discussed. In a rapidly changing world driven by money and technology, it is more than necessary to teach students about the moolah monarchy. The radicalized world today demands a financially informed youth and this session aimed to provide a rudimentary foundation towards the same. The school students at the threshold of adulthood need a basic understanding of the bank system so that they form a part of a competent citizenry. With this in mind, Paramarsh organized this seminar in over 10 schools in Vadodara. In 2015, A donation drive was conducted called \\"Winter on Wheels\\". It was a drive for collecting and donating blankets and warm clothing for northern Indian regions- Jammu Kashmir and more. In 2016, conducted Adios Addiction - Our no tobacco campaign. To achieve something great, such as making our college the first tobacco-free college in the state of Gujarat; it doesn't require a huge step. Rather, it requires an assemblage of small conjoint steps.  Spark  Spark is the souvenir of Paramarsh and forms an integral part of the event. Over the years this booklet-cum-advertorial has managed to capture through words the soul of Paramarsh. Every passing edition has radicalized Paramarsh and each new editor has brought a novel nuance to the event.  Organization  Paramarsh is a non-profit, student-run organization which started back in 2001. It includes students from all the fields of engineering who run this event without any assistance of professionals or event management companies.

Similar to short stories, character sketches in journalism became popular among 1960s writers and in this era focused on providing a realistic ‚Äúpicture of a type of person,‚ÄùWolfe, Tom; Johnson, E. W. (1973). The New Journalism. Harper & Row. . P.80. but differed in that sketches did not tell stories of particular individuals. Often, sketches served as warm-ups to an actual story, with light tone, mild mood and focus on a single aspect of the character type, ‚Äúusually in details of status life,\\" such as social or economic status. Summary ::\\"Clothing IS important. Especially if you‚Äôve got braces and bony fingers and a bump the size of a goddam coconut on your head. And especially if you‚Äôre fourteen. Because‚Äîask anyone. Fourteen is shit.‚ÄùWolfe, Tom; Johnson, E. W. (1973). The New Journalism. Harper & Row. . P.84. Told in third-person point of view, limited to the protagonist, Gear is about a mid- to late-1960s 14-year-old boy named Ronnie. Ronnie wants to be cool and accepted because he is often made fun of by his peers. The kids call him ‚ÄúRailroad Tracks‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrooklyn Bridge‚Äù for the metal braces in his mouth. He is sketched as funky looking: skinny with acne; curly, balding hair; ‚Äúbent fingers;‚Äù and ‚Äúa face that looks like the end of a watermelon.‚ÄùGoldstein, Richard; The Village Voice (1969). Greenwich Village, N.Y. P.81. Rpt. in The New Journalism. At home, he feels unwanted and as though his parents take him for granted. Ronnie lives in vain to become more like those who are popular ‚Äì those the tone implies he thinks are more desirable and attractive to the world. He buys a pair of bell-bottom pants and has his mother tailor the cuffs to look cool. Thinking the new pants will make him more of a man, he heads out with the assumption that life will be better. The style of clothing Ronnie selects is typical of the style of a 1960s mod, as he is called by the narrator. Narrative analysis Although the setting is not specified, one can assume that it is somewhere in the northeastern United States, probably New York City, as the boy‚Äôs nickname is ‚ÄúBrooklyn Bridge‚Äù and his pants were priced in dollars. It is stated in the story that Ronnie takes the bus to Fordham Road, a well known street in the Bronx, hometown of Goldstein. Several literary elements are used to progress the sketch, the most important being symbolism, subtext, point of view, tone and mood. The narrator speaks from a limited, third-person point of view, but is able to illuminate the scene with powerful symbols. The tone is juvenile and impressionable, as Ronnie imagines himself in the likeness of Brian Jones, a popular, attractive icon of the 1960s hipster, and guitarist for the Rolling Stones, moving like him in the mirror and putting an unlit cigarette in his mouth and a handkerchief in his pants to look cool and feel macho. Silas Marner is a book Ronnie is reading that is about a weaver, Silas, who is framed for murder by his best friend, William, after stealing from a church and getting arrested. He is then forced to leave his home town to avoid false punishment. William marries the woman with whom Silas was in a relationship. Silas works and saves up everything he earns only to have it stolen by a man named Dunstan. He is lonely and desperate for better fortune and through his lack of inclusion, feels his life is meaningless. When he takes in a child who's drug-using mother died in the snow, his life begins to change. He raises the child, who grows up to become well-respected. The child is discovered to be the illegitimate child of Dunstan's brother. Through saving the child's life and raising her to become successful, Silas is rewarded with a powerful sense of purpose in life. Silas Marner is symbolic of Ronnie‚Äôs desire to feel more wanted by others - to feel he has a purpose in life; a mission. Ironically, however, he discards the book under his bed in exchange for watching his turtle eat lettuce, a futile exchange of activity that avails little purpose. Looking into the mirror, he again compares himself to Brian Jones. He puts the bell-bottom pants on - his mother gave him money to buy them the day before as a result of a fight in which he cursed her - and fastens his ‚Äúboss black boots,‚ÄùWolfe, Tom; Johnson, E. W. (1973). The New Journalism. Harper & Row. . P.81. \\"boss\\" being slang for \\"cool.\\" His outfit is symbolic of his desire to become more accepted and have a purpose people appreciate, like Brian Jones and the cool ‚ÄúReign of Terror‚ÄùWolfe, Tom; Johnson, E. W. (1973). The New Journalism. Harper & Row. . P.82. kids at the park who get high on glue and smoke cigarettes. They sometimes let him have the model cars with which the glue is included. Again, symbolism reappears as he takes the pants off immediately after thinking about these kids, as if doing so made the outfit subliminally less appealing - like he feels these kids are not really who he wants to be. Upon taking off the pants and hanging them on the wall, he re-engages his childlike innocence with a fistful of Oreo cookies, a glass of milk and cartoons on TV. As the sketch clomes to an end, he puts the clothes back on, symbolizing his new machismo confidence. Then he puts an old, unlit cigarette - symbolizing his desire to look cool, but reservations of 'walking the line' - in between his lips and goes out with the assumption his peers will now admire him and he will soon be \\"getting laid.\\" References Category:The Village Voice ","title":"Gear (Village Voice)"},{"id":"36608183","text":"Andrew Hayward (born 22 June 1985) is a New Zealand field hockey player.

Henry Brewis was born near Alnwick, Northumberland in 1932. He was one of the old style farmers, locally well known, and spent much of his life farming a mixed arable and livestock business at Hartburn, near Morpeth, Northumberland. He began his artistic work of drawings, sketches, cartoons etc. in the 1970s and these together with his writings became very popular, and featured regularly in the farming magazines, particularly the West Cumberland Farmers Journal, regional NFU journals and Livestock Farming. His book, Funnywayt'mekalivin' was a great success at the 1983 Smithfield Show with Henry Brewis in great demand to sign copies of the book. He eventually sold his property on a lease-back arrangement so that he could spend more time on his side-line which by now had developed into a not so small local industry with the addition of greetings cards, decorated beer mugs and Tee shirts etc., audio tapes and prints of his cartoons. He had by this time even converted a byre into a studio. Henry Brewis died in 2000 leaving three children and two grandchildren.

Mission and activities As part of the Executive Secretariat, located in State Department's headquarters in Washington, D.C., the Operations Center provides senior policy makers with alerts and briefings on world events affecting U.S. interests abroad. The organization's mission is to get the right information to the right people at the right time. To do so, the Operations Center is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. In addition to day-to-day operations, when a crisis arises, the Operations Center may set up a task force to address logistics and, in conjunction with the Consular Affairs bureau, assists U.S. citizens in need. In response to the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, as with many other crises, the Operations Center convened a task force to assist in coordinating humanitarian response, informing domestic and foreign officials, and aiding American citizens. History and activities The Operations Center was inaugurated in 1961 at the instruction of President John F. Kennedy. When the President could not reach anyone at State in the midst of a political crisis, he realized the importance of maintaining a crisis response center. At its inception, only one watch officer manned the Operations Center supplied with a GI-issue bunk bed, a water pitcher, and a telephone. Since then, the Operations Center has grown with the needs of the Secretary of State and the expanding U.S. diplomatic presence around the world. The Operations Center is made up of two parts: The Watch and Crisis Management Support. The Watch The Operations Center handles approximately 340,000 calls annually. It is manned by Watchstanders who work in shifts to provide coverage around the clock. At any moment, one of the State Department's top leaders might call in requesting information on breaking news stories. These incoming calls overlap with the near constant intake of press and cable traffic. Watchstanders receive and process this information as a team. As Watchstanders receive information, they assess its importance and reach out to embassies and consulates overseas, as well as country desk officers at headquarters, to contextualize the information. The most relevant items are shared with senior officials through daily written and oral briefs. Crisis Management and Strategy Officers in Crisis Management and Strategy (CMS) analyze information with an eye towards anticipating future hot spots around the world. By preparing for crises before they arise, CMS helps embassies and consulates abroad adjust their security protocols for any natural disaster or potential source of conflict. When a crisis does happen, CMS oversees tasks forces, managing coordination within the State Department and between interagency actors. In the Media: Reflecting on 50 Years of Service The Operations Center recently celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton marked this occasion by sharing some of her memorable interactions with the Operations Center. In one instance, she called asking to speak with an ambassador visiting Washington. A few minutes later, a Watch Officer connected her. Only later did she learn that the Ambassador did not have his cell phone with him. The Operations Center officers had called the Ambassador‚Äôs temporary residence and learned that the concierge had recommended three restaurants, but did not know which one he had chosen. Within minutes, while Secretary Clinton remained on the line, the officers dialed the restaurants, circulated a picture of the Ambassador, and requested that the waitstaff scan the premise for his party. A Watch Officer connected the Secretary with the Ambassador so quickly she was not initially aware of the exhaustive search process. As Secretary Clinton stated later on, ‚ÄúThat is perseverance!‚Äù Secretary Clinton also highlighted the office's role in rescuing a downed American pilot in Libya, a story which illustrates the international reach of the Operation Center's reputation. A Libyan man who had received an education grant from the U.S. government found the pilot and called the Operations Center. The Watch Officer then called the U.S. Department of Defense, who promptly arranged his rescue. These stories highlight how the Operations Center supports the State Department's goal of serving American citizens and safeguarding U.S. interests abroad.

Their firm employed more than 40,000 people. They were quick to seize new opportunities created by wars, political events, and the opening of new markets, such as corn, cotton, silk, opium and fruit. Scio House was named after the family's birthplace, the Greek city and island of Chios. Mary Ann Chadwell describes driving \\"with Mrs Peter Ralli's children to Putney to see the grounds of Mrs E.

He later painted landscapes in a highly Romantic style reminiscent of P. C. Skovgaard's. Especially his Italian landscapes demonstrate his deep appreciation of his subjects. His works are always well composed and clearly proportioned with a good sense of relationship between the foreground and the background while the colouring is faithful to the local tones. His works are often of a highly aesthetic quality, true to the tradition of the Danish Golden Age. One of the reasons Brendstrup is not widely recognized in Denmark is that he spent long periods abroad, often in Portugal and Italy. Furthermore, some of the landscapes he painted in and around Naples and the Italian town of Olevano were not acquired by museums in Denmark, and are now privately owned. He exhibited regularly at Charlottenborg from 1835 to 1882, not only foreign landscapes but also Danish scenes, particularly from the north of Zealand. In 2012 the first ever major exhibition on Brendstrup and his work was jointly organised by Fuglsang Art Museum and Ribe Art Museum, and a book issued on this occasion with the most updated research on the artist.

Navajo Tribe, 471 U.S. 195 (1985), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that an Indian tribe is not required to obtain the approval of the Secretary of the Interior in order to impose taxes on non-tribal persons or entities doing business on a reservation. Background Map of Navajo reservation =History= The Navajo Tribe is an Indian (Native American) tribe with a reservation occupying parts of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. In 1978, the tribal council passed two taxing ordinances.Wilkinson, Charles F. (1996), Home Dance, the Hopi, and Black Mesa Coal: Conquest and Endurance in the American Southwest, 1996 BYU L. R. 449, Brigham Young Univ. The first was a tax of 3% on leaseholds (such as mineral rights) and the second was a 5% tax on business activity. The tribe forwarded the ordinances to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in the Department of the Interior for approval. The BIA informed the tribe that there was no law that required federal approval for a tribal tax.Kerr-McGee v. Navajo Tribe, . =Lower courts= Kerr-McGee held substantial mineral rights in the reservation and filed a lawsuit in the federal district court seeking an injunction to prohibit the tribe from collecting the tax. Kerr-McGee argued that any tax of non-Indians by a tribe required approval by the Secretary of the Interior and the district court agreed, granting the injunction. The tribe appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit overruled the district court, finding no federal statute or regulation required such approval. Kerr-McGee then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari and agreed to hear the case. Decision Chief Justice Warren Burger, author of the unanimous opinion =Arguments= Alvin H. Shrago argued the case for Kerr-McGee. Elizabeth Bernstein argued the case for the tribe. The United States argued the case on behalf of the tribe. Amicus curiae briefs were filed in support of Kerr-McGee by the Arizona Public Service Co., the Peabody Coal Co., the Phillips Petroleum Co., the Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District and Texaco, Inc.. Amicus curiae briefs were filed in support of the tribe by Association on American Indian Affairs and for the Shoshone Indian Tribe Reservation. Kerr-McGee argued that the Indian Reorganization ActIndian Reorganization Act of 1934, , . (IRA) required the Secretary of the Interior to approve any tribal taxes on non- Indians. They also argued that the Indian Mineral Leasing ActIndian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, , . (IMLA) required BIA approval for taxes. =Opinion of the Court= Chief Justice Burger delivered the unanimous opinion of the court. Burger noted that the IRA only required BIA approval of tribal constitutions and bylaws, not the power to tax. He noted that it would not affect the Navajo tribe in any case, since the tribe declined to accept the provisions of the IRA.Resnik, Judith (1989), Dependent Sovereigns: Indian Tribes, States, and the Federal Courts, 56 U. Chi. L. R. 671, Univ. of Chicago. Burger also took note that the tribal authority to tax had been recognized long before the IRA was enacted. The IMLA also did not require approval for taxes, merely requiring that the Secretary issue regulations on oil and gas leases, which he has done. The regulations do not require his approval for taxes by tribes. Burger noted that the policy of the federal government was to promote tribal self-government, and the power to tax is an inherent power of government. When a tribe executes a mineral rights lease it is acting in a commercial matter, and that does not prevent the tribe from exercising tribal sovereignty in enacting a tax. Since there is not a federal law prohibiting such a tax, the tribe is within its rights to enact one. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit was affirmed. Subsequent developments Kerr- McGee is one of a series of cases where the Supreme Court has ruled, based on tribal sovereignty, that tribes have the right to tax non-Indians.Allen, Mark (1989), Native American Control of Tribal Natural Resource Development in the Context of the Federal Trust and Tribal Self-Determination, 16 B.C. Envtl. Aff. L. Rev. 857, Boston College.Krakoff, Sarah (2004), A Narrative of Sovereignty: Illuminating the Paradox of the Domestic Dependent Nation, 83 Ore. L. R. 1109, Univ. of Oregon. These cases led to tribes renegotiating inequitable mineral leases, forming their own natural resources regulatory agencies, and tribal development companies.Stout, Jacob (2011), Tribal Self- Determination in Natural Resources: Management, Control, and Trust Responsibilities or the Lack Thereof in Navajo Nation v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 1547 (2009), 89 Neb. L. R. 538, Univ. of Nebraska. In the case of the Navajo tribe, which had a long history of uranium mining and radioactive contamination of both tribal members and its water sources by mining firms (including Kerr-McGee), it supported the outright ban on uranium mining.Newton, Nell Jessup (1992), Indian Claims in the Courts of the Conqueror , 41 Am. Univ. L. R. 753, American Univ. It has been used to support the right of tribes to control their natural resources, including exercising civil jurisdiction over non-Indians.Krakoff, Sarah (2001), Undoing Indian Law One Case at a Time: Judicial Minimalism and Tribal Sovereignty, 50 Am. Univ. L. R. 1177, American Univ. In recognition of the importance of the decision to the tribe, the tribal council declared that the date of the decision was a tribal holiday, known as \\"Navajo National Sovereignty Day.\\" See also * Uranium mining and the Navajo people * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 471 References External links * Category:1985 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court Category:Uranium mining on the Navajo Nation Category:United States Native American case law Category:Navajo history Category:Kerr-McGee ","title":"Kerr-McGee Corp. v.

Biography Lax was born in Sari√±ena, the son of Leonor de la Cueva and Gaspar Lax, a physician, and had two brothers and four sisters. Gonz√°lez Anc√≠n, Miguel & Towns, Otis.

Also during this period of time, all along with another friend, Lax fatally wounded another student by hitting his head. Gonz√°lez Anc√≠n, Miguel & Towns, Otis. (2017) p. 143, 359-360 He later moved to Paris, and there he taught in 1507‚Äì1508 at the Coll√®ge de Calvi and then at the Coll√®ge de Montaigu, where he was a student of John Mair (or Major) and simultaneously was a teacher himself. In Paris he was known as the \\"Prince of Sophists,\\" and his works and lessons were very praised. He taught in Paris until 1516, and then returned to Spain. Some researchers think there was an attempt by some of king Charles V's servants to appoint him University of Saragossa's High Master, just as they had tried to appoint Erasmus as High Chancellor of the same university during the same months. Gonz√°lez Anc√≠n, Miguel & Towns, Otis. (2017) p. 149,241-242 In the end this was not possible, and he was appointed as a teacher in the University of Huesca, that same year. There he taught until 1520, when he became University of Saragosa's High Master (similar to a dean), vice-chancellor and rector, and also was simultaneously one of the four Masters of Arts, a position very similar to Arts faculty's professor in other universities. There he had his brilliant nephew Michael Servetus as a student in the same university, who also became in 1525 one of the four Masters of Arts. During this period of time Lax, who had erasmian friends, permitted that Erasmus's works would be read and taught in the university. In 1527 apparently Lax attacked his nephew and colleague Michael Servetus in a violent brawl of which no other details are known, but that got Servetus expelled. The most probable causes of this clash is that Servetus would have started talking of his \\"heretic\\" theological ideas, or that Lax had silenced Servetus's probable collaboration in his work Quaestiones phyisicales, which just 11 days before had started to get in print.Gonz√°lez Anc√≠n, Miguel & Towns, Otis.

She took a break from her music career to start a family from 2002 to 2004. She is known to have diversity styles which is mostly pop as well as being famous for several ballad songs. She was one of four judges on The Voice of Vietnam Kids in 2013.  Family  Her full name is Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Hi·ªÅn Th·ª•c born on May 13, 1981. Her mother is a highschool teacher, she has an elder sister and brother, the brother passed away due to an accident at the age of 22 years old.  Career  = Debut = At the age of 8, she already got used to the stage performance. Being the youngest child and exposing her interested in singing, despite family difficulty, her parents still sent her to District 1's Children Culture House under the instruction of teacher Le Vinh Phuc. Thank to her crystal and innocent voice alongside the confidence of a little girl, she was chosen to be a member of Son Ca team, that later she often got chance to performance and became well liked among other children. At the age of 10, she was a little star as 3 years in a row (1990, 1991, 1992) she always won the top prize of solo performance at many national children song contests. She became a familiar face along with Ngoc Linh, Diem Quyen, Quang Vinh,... During her school time at Le Quy Don Highschool, she no longer participated in many singing activities as much as before. At the age of 16, she was the top graduate of Ho Chi Minh Music Institute (same class with My Tam and Pham Thanh Thao). She began professional career and used to cooperate with Ballad Song Center of Ho Chi Minh City. With the foundation from early age and impressive performing style, she was expected to be one of the top pop singers of Ho Chi Minh City. In 1999, she won gold medal and Best Performance Artist award of Asia's Voice contest in Shanghai. This was the based which let her quickly prove herself. She released the first CD Email Tinh Yeu as a collection of favorite songs such as Cau Chuyen Tinh Toi, Chiec La Dau Tien, Email Love...However, as her career was going upward, in 2002, she suddenly took a break due to personal issues. = 2004-2010 = During first day of the comeback, she struggled a lot to overcome the stereotype of being a single mom at that time, as well as her name had slowly faded due to many new faces coming in the 2000s. She began performing again at tearooms, bars, small shows yet got paid the same amount as new singers. In 2004, she officially came back with the album Vol. 2 - Kim however it wasn't impressive enough. The rock alternative song Mot Ngay Ta Xa Nhau of the album Kim was quite well liked later and it was still performed by her. The failure of this album encouraged her to produce more products. In next 2 years, a series of album based on five elements such as Bao (Thuy), Q (Tho), Hoa and Moc were released. In 2005, she released the single Dau Co Loi Lam which was composed by Ho Hoai Anh. This was her hit and it was charted in many music charts. Her name started to be mentioned again alongside the song rather than the curiosity of her personal life previously. With five elements project, she proved herself to be an enthusiastic singer with the acoustic album Moc which received many positive feedback from the audience and professionals. The album consisted ballad songs which won Golden Album award of December 2006 and another Golden Album award of 2007 and 1,000 copies was sold. Bearing simple and soft music, feminine voice without much technique, Moc marked her maturity in image and vocal emotion of hers. In 2007, she started the project named Diamond which was still the same style as Moc and new experience in remixing. Diamond included ballad songs from composers like Bao Chan, Ngoc Chau, Tran Thanh Son, Tang Nhat Tue, which was rated to be a well mix of art and entertainment. As worldmusic style was getting more familiar, all the songs were added folk music and mixed in ambient style to expand the depth of music space. However, the album didn't have any hit song like the previous ones. Her voice during this period of time was deeper rather than her old innocent voice previously. To be working on many projects alongside with more artistic albums, she still managed to released Vol. 7 Sunflower which included many songs which hadn't been officially released but used to be performed many times in music shows and stages. In May 2009, she released the album Portrait 17 which included least famous songs of late songwriter Trinh Cong Son. The name of album was from the portrait which was drawn by the late songwriter himself as a gift to Hien Thuc at the age of 17. She was motivated to produce Trinh's music when the song Con Tuoi Nao Cho Em in Moc album was highly complimented. Portrait 17 was also a gift for her mother who is a fan of Trinh Cong Son. The CD consisted pop, funk, semi-classical remixed songs rather than the basic style of Trinh Cong Son's song. Con Tuoi Nao Cho Em was directly taken from the previous album Moc, the album itself included 1/3 acoustic songs. With sweet and bright singing style and young spirit, she was well rated by the professionals and audience. The album won Golden Album award of June 2009. She used to be starred in two TV dramas O Tro Trong Nha Minh and Lay Vo Sai Gon and also a host of Bai Hat Viet show. She also stated that these weren't her profession so she didn't experience them much. = 2010-now = In 2010, ballad album Taurus targeted at young audience received Favorite Album award of Green Wave Award. This was the first time she appeared in the list of Top 10 Favorite Singers of Green Wave Award. Although she had been working for years and gained certain successes, she wasn't lucky enough as she kept failing at Potential Artist category since 2005. The hit Yeu Dau Theo Gio Bay of album Taurus marked her breakthrough comeback to pop music since 2000s. The song was made into single as well as remixed in R&B;, ballad, jazz and rock. From 2010 and furthermore, her name was tied with a series of pop songs such as Mo Mot Hanh Phuc, Nhu Van Con Day, Giac Mo Ngay Xua, Yeu Dau Theo Gio Bay, Dieu Em Lo So,... She doesn't pursue only one music genre as she wanted to achieve multi-genre singer. She was one of a few singers that could balance well between artistic and entertainment. People often considered her to be singing deep ballad songs. Her medium vocal was feminine, soft and she often adjusted her voice to fit any song. In 2011, she released the album Thien Su as being ordered from Viet Tan Studio, which consisted love songs of Trinh Cong Son after the sudden success of Portrait 17. Thien Su was the third album that she cooperated with famous producer and guitarist from Ha Noi - Thanh Phuong, like Moc and Diamond. Unlike Portrait 17 which was mostly ballad songs about love, country and human, in Thien Su there were many familiar yet more complicated songs filled with thoughts about love and oneself. A feminine version of Hien Thuc based on the raw guitar playing of Thanh Phuong, among there was pop remixes from the production of Huyen Trung. Early of 2012, she successfully performed the song Nhat Ky Cua Me from young composer Nguyen Van Chung. The music video which was portrayed by sand animation of Nguyen Van Chung himself and most lyrics was like from the diary of the mom-to-be until her kid grows up drew lots of attention and many views on social media, and gained sympathy from the listeners. The song was nominated for Song of The Year award at plenty of music awards, however it only received Favorite Song award of July of Bai Hat Yeu Thich 2012. Nhat Ky Cua Me gradually became a familiar song about family love in recent years of the audience. At the end of 2012, she released a pop album titled Free 3:15 pm inspired by her birth hour, this was a pop ballad album targeting at the mass audience which wasn't required more experiment and profession expectation. All the songs were composed by young composers who were also her close partners. 6/14 of the song of the album were hits which had been performed many times by her before being listed in the album. In April 2013, she released the album Tam Thang Nam including unique and modern remixes of ballad and folk songs. The album was inspired from the song To Tam which had been included in the album Tho previously, and another song Phan To Tam (Ho Tinh Tam) which was about the life of a singer. In June 2013, she was the coach of The Voice Kid Vietnam first season on VTV3 channel in cooperation with Cat Tien Sa Agency. One of her team members Phuong My Chi was a runner-up who is apparently a famous kid singer specialized in South folk songs. On March 1, 2014, she held first ever liveshow of her career after 25 years as this was a part of Dau Au concert produced by VTV in cooperate with Thanh Nien Media. She was one of few singers who have been having a long time working but never had chance to hold own liveshow. Dau An Hien Thuc also witnessed a mass audience to compare with previous liveshows. Although the liveshow was limited in time due to be aired live on television which didn't portray her 25 years enough but the crew tried hard to bring the most concentrated symbols of her career through the presentation of many songs based on many genres. Besides music, the liveshow also brought lots of impression about her love and relationship with family, teachers, friends, colleagues and her members from The Voice Kid Vietnam.  Personal life  In 2002, when her career was going well, she suddenly announced to get married with Tuan Thang, the leader of famous Sai Gon Boys band in 90s after two-year relationship. Tuan Thang was also the manager and editor of her first CD. However, the wedding was cancelled. Also in the same year, she temporarily stopped working to give birth at the age of 21. This was the hard time for her family as his father suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. Her mother had to take care of the father as well as Hien Thuc and her sister who were both into the final stage of pregnancy. Gia Bao is the name of her daughter, she was allowed to visit the father's family but it ended as Hien Thuc said that \\"their care was not genuine, so I stopped letting her visit them, also not wanting her to ever meet them again\\". She was the first single mother singer in Vietnam. In 2005, thank to the encouragement from Phuong Thanh, she decided to join in an interview to officially reveal about her daughter. According to her, this event \\"opened a new chapter of my life\\". Apparently, she is still living with her daughter. She is a Christian and often records many Christian songs as well as performs at the church.  Controversy  = Music and image = Beside being resemble with K-pop Queen Lee Hyo-ri, she was suspected to plagiarism the song Only One of BoA which was released as \\"Yeu Dau Theo Gio Bay\\" in 2013. = Conflict with singer Thanh Thao = During first years of the comeback, besides personal life's issues, she faced lots of problems regarding songs' copyright. For instance, regarding two songs Co Don Minh Em and Khuc Tinh Sau with singer Thanh Thao. The conflict was officially clarified as her manager at that time - Trinh Tu Trung accused Thanh Thao for exclusively buying the copyright of two songs while Hien Thuc had finished recording them and about to release the album. This put her into financial crisis. However, according to the only statement from Thanh Thao in which she denied it, as she said that whether it was right or wrong, the composer of these songs - Phuong Uyen should be the one who clarified. When Hien Thuc announced the release of Co Don Minh Em also caused Thanh Thao some problems but she let it pass. Thanh Thao also stated that anyone can perform this song as long as they asked for permission, however Hien Thuc didn't. In 2009, Hien Thuc performed in liveshow of Han Thai Tu which was produced by Music Box Agency of Thanh Thao. However, their relationship was still not friendly. In 2011, Thanh Thao invited her to perform at the show Ngan Sao Hoi Tu and their relationship was better ever since. Moreover, Hien Thuc was also dragged into copyright issue with Thu Minh and Hoang Le Vi. Both of them was finally solved.

Ill-health of trees can be diagnosed, and early treatment, pruning or felling to prevent the spread may result in timber stocks and amenity trees being saved. Tree owners and Arborists/arboriculturists need to be aware of the risk posed by hazardous trees. Construction projects sometimes avoidably damage trees. Sources of tree damage The causes of tree damage and abnormalities can conveniently be divided into either biotic (from living sources) or abiotic (from non-living sources).Strouts, R. G. and Winter, T. G., Diagnosis of ill-health in trees, Research for Amenity Trees No. 2 1994 Biotic sources include insects (e.g. that bore into the tree), mammals (e.g. deer that rub bark off), fungi, birds, nematodes, bacteria and viroids.Wiseman, P. Eric, Integrated Pest Management Tactics, Continuing Education Unit, International Arboricultural Society Vol 17, Unit 1, February 2008 Abiotic sources include lightning, vehicles impacts, construction activities, drought, waterlogging, frost, winds, chemicals in the soil and air and soil nutrient deficiencies. Construction activities can involve any of a number of damage types, including grade changes or compaction that prevent aeration to roots, spills involving toxic chemicals such as cement or petroleum products, or severing of branches or roots. Trees with thinner bark such as birch and American sycamore are more sensitive to such damage. One of the most common naturally occurring hazards in large trees is weakness in the union between trunk and branch (or between co-dominant substems). 'V'-shaped unions may create weakness and increase failure risk; in some situations this can be reduced by tree cabling, which limits how far the union can flex in strong winds or other loads.. Any of these damage sources and the natural ageing of trees may result in trees or parts of them failing prematurely. The term \\"hazard trees\\" is commonly used by arborists/arboriculturists, and industry groups such as power line operators, for trees that, due to disease or other factors, are more susceptible to falling in windstorms, or having parts of the tree fall. Damage may also disfigure amenity trees, create unacceptable risks to people, reduce the safe useful life of trees or reduce the value of commercial timber. Trees can withstand large amounts of some types of damage and survive, but even small amounts of other traumas can result in death, disfiguration or hazards. Established trees will normally not tolerate any appreciable disturbance of the root system.Schoeneweiss, D. F., Prevention and treatment of construction damage. Journal of Arborculture 8: 169 Without arboricultural advice, lay people and construction professionals may not be aware how easily or indirectly a tree can be killed. =Decay studies= Fallen logs of white spruce and trembling aspen at various stages of decomposition were sampled from undisturbed and 1, 14, and 28-year-old post-fire and post-harvest sites in northern Alberta, and studied for differences in the associated microfungus communities (Lumley et al. 2001).Lumley, T.C.; Gignac, L.D.; Currah, R.S. 2001. Microfungus communities of white spruce and trembling aspen logs at different stages of decay in disturbed and undisturbed sites in the boreal mixedwood region of Alberta. Can. J. Bot. 79:76‚Äì92. Wood samples were plated directly onto each of 6 different media and from these fungal species were identified and enumerated over a 24-month period. Approximately 10 000 isolates were obtained, representing 292 species of filamentous microfungi, including 41 ascomycetes, 29 zygomycetes, and 222 mitosporic fungi. The most commonly isolated species were Trichoderma viride, Rhinocladiella atrovirens, Penicillium pinophilum and Mortierella ramanniana. Cluster analysis and ordination of microfungus communities in logs showed that the tree species of the log had the greatest influence on the species composition of communities. Fungus community composition was also correlated with the stage of decomposition. Species richness was highest in logs from undisturbed sites, and lowest in logs from the most recently disturbed sites. Species diversity (Shannon-Weaver) was only slightly higher at undisturbed sites than at disturbed sites. The most significant environmental factor was log moisture, which increased proportionately with stage of decomposition and was significantly correlated with climatic factors. Wounds inflicted on residual trees during partial cutting often provide portals for decay fungi. Affected trees are prone to blowdown and breakage at the wound site, and even if they survive to rotation age their value is reduced by staining and decay in the wood. The influence of temperature on microbial diversity in wounds in white and black spruces was investigated by Dumas and McLaughlin (2003).Dumas, M.T.; McLaughlin, J.A. 2003. Microbes inhabiting Picea wounds and their antagonism to Haematostereum sanguinolentum p. 181‚Äì193 in Laflamme, G.; B√©rub√©, J.A.; Bussi√®res, G. (Eds.). Root and Butt Rots of Forest Trees.

Samples were taken from trees wounded during manual or feller-buncher partial cutting and skidding operations in the Black Sturgeon Forest, 120 km northeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario. The samples were taken from 76 trees in early October when the mean aerial temperature exceeded 0 ¬∞C and 23 trees in late October/early November when the mean aerial temperature was below 0 ¬∞C, to serve as the pre-freeze-up and post-freeze-up groups, respectively. The wounds were sampled and cultured. The number and ratio of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi on one-week-old wounds varied between pre- and post- freeze-up wounds, wound locations, and media. However, random samples of the different classes of microbes isolated from the 2 spruce species did not differ significantly, indicating no relationship between tree species and microbe. Wounds were more common on stems (94) than on roots (64) or butts (33). Wounds on roots averaged 2 and 3 times the area of those on stems and butts, respectively. More bacteria than fungi were isolated from the pre-freeze-up wounds than from the post-freeze-up wounds, while fungi were more plentiful than bacteria on the post freeze-up wounds. Tree risk assessment Callus growth on beech branch following fire (heat) damage Evaluating the danger a tree presents, whether by its state of health or by its situation, to people and/or property is called Tree Risk Assessment. Techniques have emerged based on Matheny & Clark's Evaluation of Hazard Trees in Urban Areas, Matheny, Nelda. P., Clark , James R, International Society of Arboriculture Books, 1994 matrix of three factors which contribute to the degree of risk namely (i) failure potential (ii) size of defective part and (iii) target rating (how often something or someone is present to be harmed or damaged). Subsequently, a Quantified Tree Risk Assessment (\\"QTRA\\") system has been developed by others that calculates the risk numerically with reference to cost implications of tree damage and published societal norms of acceptable, tolerable and unacceptable risk.Ellison, M. J. Quantified Tree Risk Assessment Used in the Management of Amenity Trees. Journal Arboric. International Society of Arboriculture, Savoy, Illinois. 31:2 57-65, 2005 The International Society of Abroriculture updated its approach in 2012 with a qualitative (words based) matrix known as Qualitative Tree Risk Assessment (\\"TRAQ\\")Many sources e.g. Qualitative Tree Risk Assessment, Smiley, Matheny and Lilly, Arborist News, February 2012 To comply with the tree owner's legal duty of care to occupiers, visitors, passers-by or neighbours, where regular observation or monitoring of the tree's condition is not possible, tree inspections should be carried out at appropriate intervals by a competent person and their risk reduction recommendations should be implementedPrinciples of Tree Hazard Assessment and Management, Lonsdale David, Research for Amenity Trees No. 7, 1999. Construction and tree protection Assessment of the damaging effect of construction activities on a tree can be based on three factors: severity, extent and duration. Fundamentally activity should avoid the crown of the tree and the volume of rooting required by the tree for ongoing vitality. Severity is related to the degree of intrusion into the rooting area and resultant root loss. Extent is related to a percentage of a factor such as canopy, roots or bark, and duration is based on the length of time that the activity interferes with the tree's normal functions. Thursday, October 1, 2020 Various organisations, such as the International Society of Arboriculture, the British Standards InstituteBS5837 (2012): Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction - Recommendations, British Standards Institute, 2012 and the Tree Industry Association (formerly the National Arborist Association), have long recognised the sensitivity of tree health to construction activities. The effects are important because they can result in monetary and/or amenity value losses due to tree damage and resultant remediation or replacement costs, and/or prosecution for violation of government ordinances (in the UK, planning laws, regulations and policies) or community- or subdivision restrictions. In the US, protocols for tree management prior to, during and after construction activities are well established, tested and refined. These basic steps are involved: * Review of the construction plans * Development of the related tree inventory * Application of standard construction tree management protocols * Assessment of potential for tree damage * Development of a tree protection plan (providing for pre-, concurrent, and post construction damage prevention and remediation steps) * Development of a remediation plan * Implementation of tree protection zones (TPZ) * Assessment of construction tree damage, post- construction * Implementation of the remediation plan In the UK, a similar protocol exists BS5837 (2012): Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction - Recommendations, British Standards Institute, 2012.

The house is a large two-storey house constructed of brick and ashlar with a stone slate roof. It is situated in parkland at the north end of Bedale, off the Leyburn road. History The estate in which Bedale Hall sits was purchased in 1638 by John Peirse from the family of Sir Richard Theakston. A manor house, later incorporated into the present building, was built around the 17th century on the site. Expansion of the building to create the current Palladian mansion was commenced in 1730 by Henry Peirse, primarily by infilling between the wings of the existing house. The hall then remained unchanged until about 1760, when a new wing was added to house a racing stud, together with gallops on nearby land. In 1777 the hall was again expanded by incorporating a nearby house into the structure. In the early 19th century the estate was inherited by Henry William De La Poer Beresford from an aunt, after which he appended the surname of Peirse to his own. His son, Henry Monson De La Poer Beresford-Peirse (1850‚Äì1926) succeeded his uncle as third baronet Beresford-Peirse in February 1873. The family occupied the hall until after the First World War, when it was leased to tenants before being requisitioned for military use during the Second World War. After being handed back in 1948 the hall stood empty for a while and was invaded by a dozen squatter families who caused a considerable amount of damage to the fabric. In 1951 the building was purchased for 4,000 pounds by Bedale Rural District Council, who demolished the stable wing as unsafe and made the main building fit for use as offices, which were occupied in 1952. The surrounding land was made into a public park. The Council then undertook a programme of improvement, the objective of which was the complete restoration of the Staircase Hall, Corridor and Saloon, (now called the Ballroom) with the help of a large grant from the Historic Buildings Council. The work was completed in 1961 and every detail of the Ballroom, except for the heaters and emergency exits, is now as it was originally completed in 1730. As well as providing office space the building was used for various community activities, which continued after it was taken over by the new Hambledon council in 1974. The hall is now operated as a charitable trust. Community use The hall is host to several community organizations, located in various parts of the building, including: * Bedale Library * Bedale Museum * Bedale and Villages children's centre * Bedale Town Council and Aiskew Parish Council * Tourist Information Centre There are also offices to rent to private commercial tenants. The hall can be rented for weddings and private occasions, and there are facilities available for meetings and conferences.

Two of these models were shipped to backers, labelled as development kits; the DK1 in mid 2013 and DK2 in mid-2014, intended to provide developers with a platform to develop content in time for the Rift's release. However, both were also purchased by many enthusiasts who wished to get an early preview of the technology. The Rift saw its commercial release in March 2016 with the Rift CV1, which was discontinued in March 2019 with the release of its successor, the Oculus Rift S. History =Initial prototypes= Through Meant to be Seen (MTBS)'s virtual reality and 3D discussion forums, Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus and longtime MTBS discussion forum moderator, developed the idea of creating a new head-mounted display that was both more effective than what was then on the market, and inexpensive for gamers. The first rough prototype was hacked together in 2011 by Palmer Luckey (then 18 years old) in his parents‚Äô garage in Long Beach, California. Coincidentally, John Carmack had been doing his own research and happened upon Luckey's developments as a fellow member of MTBS. After sampling an early prototype, Carmack favored Luckey's approach and just before the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Id Software announced that their future updated version of Doom 3, BFG Edition, would be compatible with head-mounted display units. In June 2012, during the E3 convention, Carmack introduced a duct taped head- mounted display based on Luckey's Oculus Rift prototype, which ran Carmack's own software. The unit featured a high speed IMU and a LCD, visible via dual lenses, that were positioned over the eyes to provide a 90 degrees horizontal and 110 degrees vertical stereoscopic 3D perspective.The Development Kit 1 = Development Kit 1 = Rear view and control box Two months after being formed as a company, Palmer's Oculus VR launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign on August 1 of 2012 for their virtual reality headset, named the Rift. The main purpose of the Kickstarter was to get an Oculus Rift prototype‚Äînow referred to as DK1 (Development Kit 1)‚Äîinto the hands of developers to begin integration of the device into their games. The DK1 was given as a reward to backers who pledged $300 or more on Kickstarter, and was later sold publicly for $300 on their website. These kits sold at a rate of 4‚Äì5 per minute for the first day, before slowing down throughout the week. The Rift DK1 was released on March 29, 2013, and uses a screen with a significantly lower pixel switching time than the original prototype, reducing latency and motion blur when turning one's head quickly. The pixel fill is also better, reducing the screen door effect and making individual pixels less noticeable. The LCD is brighter and the color depth is 24 bits per pixel. The 7-inch screen also makes the stereoscopic 3D no longer 100% overlapping, the left eye seeing extra area to the left and the right eye seeing extra area to the right, in which there is no 3D depth perception. The field of view (FOV) is more than 90 degrees horizontal (110 degrees diagonal), which is more than double the FOV of previous VR devices from other companies, and is the primary strength of the device. The resolution is 1280√ó800 (16:10 aspect ratio), which leads to an effective of 640√ó800 per eye (4:5 aspect ratio). However, since the device does not feature a 100% overlap between the eyes, the combined horizontal resolution is effectively greater than 640. The image for each eye is shown in the panel as a barrel distorted image that is then corrected by pincushion effect created by lenses in the headset, generating a spherical-mapped image for each eye. Initial prototypes used a Hillcrest Labs 3DoF head tracker that is normally 125 Hz, with a special firmware requested by John Carmack that makes it run at 250 Hz, tracker latency being vital due to the dependency of virtual reality's realism on response time. The latest version includes Oculus's new 1000 Hz Adjacent Reality Tracker, which aims to provide much lower latency tracking than almost any other tracker. It uses a combination of three-axis gyros, accelerometers, and magnetometers, which make it capable of absolute (relative to Earth) head orientation tracking without drift. The Development Kit 1 also included interchangeable lenses that aim to allow for simple dioptric correction. The entire source for the Rift DK1 was released to the public in September 2014, including the firmware, schematics, and mechanicals for the device. The firmware is released under a simplified BSD license, while the schematics and mechanicals are released under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. =HD and Crystal Cove prototypes= In June 2013, a prototype of the Rift that used a 1080p LCD panel was shown at Electronic Entertainment Expo. This step forwards to twice the number of pixels as DK1 significantly reduced the screen door effect and made objects in the virtual world more clear, especially at a distance. The poor resolution had been the main criticism of the DK1. This HD prototype is the only prototype of the Rift shown to the public which did not turn into a publicly available developer kit. In January 2014, an updated prototype codenamed \\"Crystal Cove\\" was unveiled at Consumer Electronics Show, which used a special low-persistence of vision OLED display as well as a new motion tracking system that utilized an external camera to track infrared dots located on the headset. The new motion tracking system would allow the system to detect actions such as leaning or crouching, which was claimed to help alleviate sickness experienced by users when the software did not respond to these actions. =Development Kit 2= The Development Kit 2 Oculus began shipping Development Kit 2 (DK2) in July 2014. This is a small refinement of the \\"Crystal Cove\\" prototype, featuring several key improvements over the first development kit, such as having a higher-resolution (960√ó1080 per eye) low-persistence OLED display, higher refresh rate, positional tracking, a detachable cable, and the omission of the need for the external control box. A teardown of DK2 revealed that it incorporates a modified Samsung Galaxy Note 3 smartphone display, including the front panel from the device itself. In February 2015, Oculus announced that over 100,000 DK2 units had been shipped up until that point. =Crescent Bay prototype= In September 2014, Oculus once again presented an updated version of the Rift, codenamed Crescent Bay. This version has a greater resolution than the DK2, a lower weight, built-in audio, and 360-degree tracking thanks to the presence of tracking LEDs in the back of the headset. Oculus has also licensed software library RealSpace3D, which is expected to provide the Rift with HRTF and reverb algorithms. During a panel at SXSW 2015, titled \\"Explore the Future of VR\\", it was publicly announced for the first time that the prototype uses two screens instead of one as previously thought. =First consumer version= Oculus Rift, sometimes referred to as \\"Consumer Version 1\\" or \\"CV1.\\" Oculus VR announced on May 6, 2015, that the consumer version of the Rift would ship in the first quarter of 2016, and on March 25, 2016 the first batch of headsets began shipping to consumers. The consumer version is an improved version of the Crescent Bay Prototype, featuring per-eye displays with a 1080√ó1200 resolution, running at 90 Hz, 360-degree positional tracking, integrated audio, a vastly increased positional tracking volume, and a heavy focus on consumer ergonomics and aesthetics. In March 2019, during the announcement of the Rift S, it was said that the Rift S would replace the original Rift. However, Oculus VR stated that they planned to support the CV1 with software updates for \\"the foreseeable future.\\" =Rift S= On May 21, 2019, Oculus began shipping a new VR headset known as Rift S. The Rift S has a 1,280 √ó1,440 LCD @ 80 Hz and slightly larger field of view than that of the CV1, but lacks mechanical IPD adjustment (IPD adjustment is software-only). The Rift S tracks the position of itself and its controllers in 3D space using a system known as Oculus Insight, which uses the 5 cameras on the HMD to track points in the environment and infrared LEDs on the controllers, information from accelerometers in both the HMD and controllers, and computer vision to predict what path the HMD and controllers are most likely to take. The Rift S uses a DisplayPort 1.2 port and one USB 3.0 port, as opposed to the HDMI and USB 3.0 port used on the Rift CV1. The Rift S targets the same price point (USD$399) and hardware requirements as the Rift CV1, and has now replaced the Rift CV1. Software =Runtime= The Oculus Rift runtime officially supports Microsoft Windows, macOS, and GNU/Linux. The installation package includes components such as the headset driver (which includes Oculus Display driver and controller drivers), Positional Tracking Sensor driver, Oculus Service, and Oculus Home Application. The runtime service implements a number of processing techniques intended to minimize latency and in addition improve the smoothness of VR applications under weaker hardware. These include direct mode, asynchronous timewarp, and asynchronous spacewarp. =Oculus Home= When the user puts on the Rift and no other content is being outputted to the headset, they are presented with Oculus Home. This is the default environment of the Rift, which presents them with a loft environment and a floating menu, allowing the user to launch VR applications they own, see if their friends are using the Rift, and purchase virtual reality content on the Oculus Home store from the headset. An update to the base software, called Core 2.0, introduced a more interactive default environment, allowing the user to navigate and customize it with imported 3D models. =Oculus Store= Oculus maintains a market place for applications for the headsets. The listings are curated to only allow applications that run smoothly on the recommended hardware. Most listings are also rated on their comfort level based on their likelihood of causing motion sickness or number of jump scares. However, developers do not have to use Oculus Home to distribute content for the Rift, this being entirely optional. The Store can be accessed from the VR-based Oculus Home, from its desktop app, or on the Oculus web site under the section \\"Experiences.\\"  Features  Listings on the registry include: * Age and content ratings * Comfort rating: \\"comfortable\\", \\"moderate\\", \\"intense\\" (assigned by Oculus) * User ratings and reviews: user can give a rating on a 5-star scale and write a review =SDK= Content for the Rift is developed using the Oculus PC SDK, a free proprietary SDK available for Microsoft Windows (OSX and Linux support is planned for the future). This is a feature complete SDK which handles for the developer the various aspects of making virtual reality content, such as the optical distortion and advanced rendering techniques. The Oculus SDK is directly integrated with the popular game engines Unity 5, Unreal Engine 4, and Cryengine. This allows for developers already familiar with these engines to create VR content with little to no VR- specific code. The Rift is an open platform, and thus developers do not need any approval or verification to develop, distribute, or sell content for it, and do not have to pay any licensing fees. The SDK, however, cannot be modified or reused for other purposes or hardware without permission. Content developed for the Development Kit 2 using SDK version 0.8 or above are compatible with the Rift; however, content developed for the Development Kit 1 or with older versions of the SDK will have to be recompiled using the latest SDK version to be compatible. On 21 December 2015, Oculus announced the release of their finalized Rift 1.0 SDK, combined with the start of shipping their final version of the Oculus Rift VR headset to developers. At Oculus's 3rd annual conference (Oculus Connect 3), it announced the new technology, called \\"Asynchronous Spacewarp (ASW)\\". This technology allows the Rift to compensate for the dropped frames. According to Oculus, ASW reduces the minimum specs of a PC to run the Rift without any judder.  System requirements  In May 2015, Oculus VR announced \\"recommended\\" hardware specifications for computers utilizing Oculus Rift, specifying a CPU equivalent to an Intel Core i5-4590, at least 8GB of RAM, at least an AMD Radeon R9 290 or Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 graphics card, an HDMI 1.3 output, three USB 3.0 ports, and one USB 2.0 port. Oculus VR stated that these requirements would remain in force for the life of the first consumer model. The company also stated that while upcoming discrete GPUs for laptops may be able to reach the required performance for Oculus Rift, systems that switch between integrated and discrete graphics may not handle output in a manner that supports the device. Oculus Rift only supports 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 or later; Oculus VR stated that the device would initially support Windows only in order to focus on \\"delivering a high[-]quality consumer-level VR experience\\"; support for Linux and macOS will be developed in the future. A hardware testing application is available, and Oculus VR has also certified and promoted specific models of pre-built computers that meet these recommendations, from vendors such as Asus, Alienware and Dell Inc., as being \\"Oculus Ready\\". On October 6, 2016, Oculus VR announced lessened hardware recommendations, now suggesting an Intel Core i3-6100 or AMD FX 4350 CPU, at least a GeForce GTX 960 or equivalent graphics card, two USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port, and Windows 8 or newer. The company stated that these lower requirements were enabled by the adoption of motion interpolation; on systems that cannot handle full 90 frames per second rendering, the drivers will allow software to render at 45 FPS instead, and generate frames based on differences between them to send to the headset to maintain its frame rate. Oculus promoted that these changes lowered the average hardware cost of a PC meeting these specifications to US$500 and would also enable certain laptops to run Oculus Rift. In June 2018, Oculus VR updated its recommended OS spec to Windows 10. While Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users would still be able to access the standard Rift experience, newer features and apps might require an upgrade to Windows 10. Applications =Gaming= Oculus has stated that the Rift is primarily a gaming device and that their main content focus is gaming. Existing games with a first-person or fixed-camera perspective can be ported to VR with some development effort. However, Oculus has stated that the best virtual reality experiences are those that are designed, from the beginning, for the Rift. A number of AAA games have added Rift support (and can be played with the Development Kit 2), including Project CARS, Elite: Dangerous, Euro Truck Simulator 2, and Dirt Rally, as well as a number of indie games such as AaAaAA!!! ‚Äì A Reckless Disregard for Gravity and Ether One. Fans and hobbyists have also modded support for the Rift into several popular titles which allow for extensive low-level modding, including Minecraft and Flight Simulator X. At the release event for the Rift in June 2015, Oculus announced 9 launch titles for the Rift, including EVE: Valkyrie by CCP and Edge of Nowhere by Insomniac Games. It also announced that it was working with other developers including Final Fantasy developer Square Enix, Rock Band developer Harmonix, and The Order: 1886 developer Ready at Dawn. In July 2015, Oculus revealed that it was fully funding more than 20 second party high production value games made exclusively for the Rift, one of these being Insomniac's Edge of Nowhere. In July 2017, Marvel announced in the Disney's D23 event that it will be bringing 12 superheroes of theirs to VR with an Oculus exclusive game called Powers United VR. =Non-gaming= Media Oculus is including Oculus Cinema as a free application, which allows the Rift to be used to view conventional movies and videos from inside a virtual cinema environment, giving the user the perception of viewing the content on a cinema-sized screen. Oculus Cinema will also have a networked mode, in which multiple users can watch the same video in the same virtual space, seeing each other as avatars and being able to interact and talk to one another while watching the video. The Rift also offers the opportunity to view new types of media that are impossible to view on regular monitors; 360¬∞ 3D videos and 'virtual reality movies' (an entirely new medium). Spherical videos (commonly called 360¬∞ videos) can be viewed simply by the user moving their head around, and the Rift opens up the possibility for stereoscopic spherical videos (commonly called 360¬∞ 3D videos). In September 2014, NextVR announced that they would be using a $200,000 camera rig to produce 360¬∞ 3D content for the Rift, including short films, as well as live streaming live events such as sports or concerts in 360¬∞ 3D. In July 2015, Oculus announced a deal with Canadian film company Felix & Paul Studios to produce 360¬∞ 3D videos for the Rift. The Rift also supports a new medium of entertainment experiences, which Oculus calls \\"virtual reality movies\\". Oculus has established Oculus Story Studio to develop this type of content for the Rift, a team which has multiple former employees from major VFX companies such as PIXAR and ILM. Oculus Story Studio showed off its first VR movie, Lost, at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, gaining positive reviews from attendees. The studio intends to have 5 VR shorts released with the Rift at launch, including Lost, Bullfighter, Henry, Dear Angelica, and Kabloom. Social A visitor at Mozilla Berlin Hackshibition trying an Oculus Rift virtual reality experience on Firefox Oculus believes that social applications will be the most popular virtual reality experiences in the long term. A number of social applications for the Rift are in development, and it is expected that there will be significant competition in the sector. In May 2015, AltspaceVR launched a public beta for DK2 owners to try out their social VR platform. AltspaceVR allows people to inhabit a shared virtual space with spatial voice communications, cast content from the Internet on virtual screens, and interact with objects (allowing activities such as playing chess or other board games). It also supports extra hardware like eye tracking and body tracking. In 2013, Philip Rosedale, the founder of Second Life, left Linden Lab to work on a new virtual world designed for the Rift, called High Fidelity, which will link thousands of user-hosted virtual environments together into a consistent virtual world. In May 2015, Linden Lab, the company behind Second Life, announced that they too were working on a new virtual world, codenamed Project Sansar, built for virtual reality headsets such as the Rift and Gear VR. Like Second Life, Sansar will be hosted on Linden's servers and lease virtual land to players, on which they can build and sell virtual items and services (which Linden will take a cut of). Linden Lab hoped to release Sansar by the end of 2016. Industrial and professional As well as the consumer uses, the Rift has attracted significant interest from industry and professional spheres for productivity enhancement, visualization, and advertising. A number of architecture firms have been experimenting with using the Rift for visualization and design. With the right software, the Rift allows architects to see exactly what their building will look like and get an understanding of the scale that is impossible on a traditional monitor. In early 2015, Audi started using Rift Developer Kit 2's at dealerships to help customers configure the car they are interested in, as well as to see what driving a race in the car would be like. The Norwegian Army has been experimenting with the Rift Development Kit 2 to allow for a greater situational awareness of armoured vehicle drivers and commanders. The use of Oculus Rift on an innovative virtual operator station assists the control of a teleoperated military mobile robot Tactical Robotic System (TAROS). Human operators can have intuitive control and mediate 3D view from stereovision cameras. Oculus Medium is a Painting Experience for Oculus Rift. Education A library workstation with an Oculus Rift. The Oculus Rift is increasingly used in universities and schools as an educational tool. The ability to provide an immersive, engaging environment can assist a diverse range of students for learning. In particular, there appears to be benefits to medical, health science and exercise students when utilising the Oculus Rift as a supplement for content provided in anatomy and physiology. There is also increasing use of the Oculus Rift within curricula in other fields such as marketing, architecture, clinical education., computer science and paramedics Television In October 2016, the television series Halcyon was released as a \\"virtual reality series\\", where some episodes are broadcast on conventional television. and some as VR content for Oculus Rift. It is a crime drama following the world's first \\"VR Crimes Unit\\" in 2048. Sports Fox Sports began producing content for the Oculus Rift and other virtual reality systems in fall 2016. Its initial content consisted mainly of Fox College Football coverage. Casinos Some online casinos have started using Oculus Rift to provide a unique online casino experience, allowing the user to play slots and experience the lobby of a casino through their VR headset. ZeniMax/Facebook lawsuits ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, which in turn owns Id Software, presented a lawsuit against Facebook, claiming the Oculus Rift was the product of intellectual property owned by ZeniMax, developed by John Carmack during his time working for Id Software. The jury ruled partially in favor of ZeniMax, finding the defendants did not steal trade secrets but had violated a non-disclosure agreement. Facebook and some of the Oculus corporate officers were ordered to pay a total of US$500 million. On March 10, 2017, it was revealed that Carmack was suing ZeniMax for US$22.7 million it owed him from their purchase of Id Software. Reception The Oculus Rift received generally positive reviews from gaming and tech websites. Wired gave 9 out of 10 stars to Oculus Rift and wrote, \\"The long-promised virtual reality headset is finally here, in a remarkably well- made and accessible device.\\" A review by Dan Stapleton of IGN says, \\"The Oculus Rift is the first headset available, and it does a fantastic job of not just displaying high-quality VR, but making it easy to use.\\" Many reviewers also wrote about the shortcomings of Rift, such as a hefty price tag ($599 in US) and the need of a powerful PC to run it. The Wall Street Journal wrote, \\"The first totally immersive home virtual reality rig is a pricey, awkward, isolating‚Äîand occasionally brilliant‚Äîglimpse of the future of computing.\\" The Verge said, \\"Virtual Reality: 8/10. Virtual reality is always almost here.\\" References External links * * Category:American inventions Category:Facebook acquisitions Category:Kickstarter-funded products Category:Products introduced in 2016 Category:Virtual reality headsets Category:Wearable devices ","title":"Oculus Rift"},{"id":"36608877","text":"Mark Andrew Lollo (born March 31, 1982) is a former American professional baseball umpire who resides in New Lexington, OH.2010-2012 Minor League Umpires StevetheUmp.com.Retrieved August 1, 2012.

It comprises the dialects in most of Norrland, except those of G√§strikland and southern H√§lsingland, where Svealand Swedish is spoken. Local dialects from H√§rjedalen and northwest J√§mtland (specifically Frostviken in Str√∂msund Municipality), which traditionally are counted as variants of the Norwegian dialect of Tr√∏ndersk, are also excluded, while J√§mtland dialects and other dialects of the region are considered to be true Norrland dialects.Nationalencyklopedin, Norrl√§ndska m√•l The border between Norrland dialects and Svealand Swedish runs through H√§lsingland, such that the northern H√§lsingland dialects are regarded as Norrland dialects and the southern ones as Svealand Swedish; an alternative delineation follows the southern border of Medelpad. The old northern border of the Swedish language in coastal Norrbotten largely followed the eastern and northern borders of Lower and Upper Kalix parishes in modern Kalix Municipality. From there, a vaguely defined linguistic border ran through Lappmarken from the northernmost point of Upper Kalix parish in an arc to the south of Porjus, then followed the Lule River to the border with Norway.  History  Norrland dialects arose from the combined influence of the Old West Norse spoken in Tr√∏ndelag to the west and the Old East Norse spoken to the south. The westerly influences were notably strong in the centuries leading up to the Viking Era. The shift to East Norse progressed through the Middle Ages. As Norrland gradually came to be more and more under Central Swedish influence in the Modern Era, many of the older West Norse characteristics disappeared. The strong West Norse influences can still be seen today in the toponymy of Norrland in placenames ending in -√•nger (, \\"harbour\\"). Parish names such Sk√∂n and Indal (both in Sundsvall Municipality) have West Nordic origins. The dialect of Norrbotten displays less West Nordic influence than other more westerly dialects. The greatest West Nordic/Norwegian, or perhaps least East Nordic/Swedish, influence is found in Jamtlandic.  Characteristics  As with other regiolects, it is difficult to clearly define a unique set of characteristics for the Norrland dialects. The distribution of different features of the dialect have differing boundaries (called isoglosses), which are described in the following summary of phenomena regarded as typical of Norrland dialects. =Vowel balance= Words that were \\"long-spelled\\" (i.e., where the syllable contained a long vowel and consonant or a short vowel followed by a long consonant or consonant cluster) in Old Swedish developed weakened or dropped end-vowels. Examples of words with weakened end-vowels are kast√§ (Standard , \\"to throw\\") and back√§ (Standard , \\"sloping ground\\"). In dialects such as those of J√§mtland and V√§sterbotten, where the end-vowels are dropped, these words become kaast and baack. Words that were \\"short-spelled\\" (i.e., where the syllable consisted of a short vowel and short consonant) have, however, conserved the original end-vowel length. Examples include tala (\\"to speak\\") and komma (\\"to come\\"). Vowel balance is also an important distinctive feature in the East Norwegian dialects. End-vowel development in words has been dependent on the stem-syllable length since the time of Old Swedish, known as \\"vowel balance\\". The dialect of Medelpad is the southernmost of the coastal dialects which has vowel balance. In the H√§lsing dialect, the endings are as in Standard Swedish: kasta, springa etc. Vowel balance is particularly evident in the definite plural of nouns: Standard Swedish h√§starna (\\"the horses\\") is in certain northern dialects h√§sta, while dagarna (\\"the days\\") is dagana. All Sami languages, particularly East Sami, have had similar systems of vowel balance since long before any Nordic languages were spoken in north Scandinavia. One theory that it put forward is that vowel balance emerged in the northern Nordic dialects as a result of the scandinavisation of the Sami people in the area, particularly the South Sami, from about 1300 to 1600.Jurij Kuzmenko, \\"Den nordiska vokalbalansens h√§rkomst\\", Svenska spr√•kets historia =Smoothing= Words that were originally \\"short-spelled\\" have often undergone a process of assimilation of the stem-vowel and ending. Examples include f√§r√§ (Standard Swedish: fara, either \\"to travel\\" or \\"danger\\") and vuku (Standard Swedish: vecka, \\"week\\") (Jamtlandic), firi (Standard Swedish: farit, \\"have travelled\\") and skyri (Standard Swedish: skurit, \\"have cut\\") (V√§sterbotten). The phenomenon, known as \\"smoothing\\", is found predominantly in the dialects from upper Dalarna and Tr√∏ndelag northward. =A and \\"thick L\\"= The Old Swedish a before the consonant cluster r√∞ has been preserved, while r√∞ itself became a retroflex flap, often referred to as a \\"thick L\\", sometimes represented as a capital \\"L\\" to differentiate it from the Standard Swedish rd cluster. Examples of the \\"thick L\\" include svaL (Standard Swedish: gr√§ssv√•l, \\"sod\\") and aL (Standard Swedish: √•rder, \\"plough\\"). The phenomenon is shared with the Dalecarlian dialects and Norwegian and the Swedish dialects in Ostrobothnia. =Fronted sj-sound= In northern Norrland, the \\"sj-sound\\" is pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge (located between the upper front teeth and the hard palate). That is a postalveolar consonant, represented variously as [ Ç] or [ É], and is sometimes merged with the \\"tj-sound\\" ([…ï]), a voiceless alveolo-palatal sibilant. In Central Sweden and southern Norrland, the \\"middle sj-sound\\" is commonly used, described as a voiceless coarticulated palatoalveolar and velarIPA-publikationen The international phonetic alphabet (2005) fricative with rounded lips and a relatively closed mouth, represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet as […ßf].Rosenquist (2007), p. 33 The broad \\"rs-sound\\" (e.g., as in f√∂rs√∂ka or urs√§kta), a voiceless retroflex sibilant, is used by many speakers in Central Sweden and southern Norrland for the fronted sj-sound, with considerable variation between individuals. The \\"back sj-sound\\" ([…ßx]) is used in southern Sweden.Rosenquist (2007), p. 33 In Finland Swedish and in English, where the distinction between the \\"sj-sound\\" and \\"tj-sound\\" is either lost or nonexistent, the fronted sj-sound is used. Examples of the sound in English include the hushing \\"sh\\" ([ É]) in she, and the cluster [t É], as in chicken. =Articles preceding proper nouns= Proper nouns in the argument position are preceded by an article, just like the weak forms of personal pronouns. For example: ja tala me a Lisa/n Erik ig√•r. That is found in dialects such as those of Medelpad, √Öngermanland, and V√§sterbotten and is uncharacteristic for Germanic languages, but similar to that of Romance languages, among others.Anders Holmberg och G√∂rel Sandstr√∂m, Vad √§r det f√∂r s√§rskilt med nordsvenska nominalfraser , Dialektsyntaktiska studier av den nordiska nominalfrasen, 2003 =Palatalisation= The consonants ‚ü®g‚ü©, ‚ü®k‚ü©, and ‚ü®sk‚ü© are pronounced as Standard Swedish ‚ü®j‚ü©, ‚ü®tj‚ü©, and ‚ü®sj‚ü© before front vowels. For example: skojin (Standard Swedish: skogen, \\"the forest\\") and ryddjin (Standard Swedish: ryggen, \\"the back\\"). That is known as palatalisation. The southern limit of the phenomenon runs through Uppland, V√§stmanland, and V√§rmland. It is also found in Ostrobothnia and in a number of dialects in Norway. =Loss of -er ending= In the present tense of strong verbs, the ending -er is lost. Norrland dialects speakers would say han bit as opposed to the Standard Swedish han biter (\\"he bites\\") and han spring as opposed to han springer (\\"he runs\\"). That is another characteristic shared with the Dalecarlian dialects as well as a number of Norwegian dialects. =End stress= The primary stress of compound words is often placed on the ending. For example: n√§vert√°k and kaffep√°nna. That is characteristic of most Norrland dialects and is found also in Uppland and S√∂dert√∂rn. =Adjective‚Äìnoun compounds= Compound words with adjectival prefixes are more common in Norrland dialects than in Standard Swedish. For instance, a Norrland dialect speaker may say l√•ngh√•re (literally, \\"long-hair\\"), as opposed to the Standard det l√•nga h√•ret (literally, \\"the long hair\\"), and grannv√§re (\\"nice-weather\\"), as opposed to det granna v√§dret (\\"the nice weather\\"). The phenomenon is also found in colloquial Svealand Swedish as well as in Finland Swedish.  Subdivisions  Just as it is difficult to precisely define unique linguistic traits for Norrland dialects, it is also difficult to split the group geographically into various subdialects; different traits are found in different areas. Nevertheless, the mediaeval parishes have played a large role in the subdivision of the Norrland dialects. Even those parishes that were organised later in the 1600s, such as Upper Kalix parish and Burtr√§sk parish, have strong dialectal features. The Swedish language came to Lappmark in the 18th and 19th centuries as ethnic Swedes began to settle the area. They came from many different regions, and some even spoke Finnish or a Sami language natively. This resulted in a blending of both dialects and languages. Most of the Lappmark dialects thus lack such archaic features as the dative case and diphthongs that the dialects of the coastal parishes have retained. Nevertheless, the differences between the various Lappmark dialects can be considerable, depending on the heritage of those who settled in a given area. A notable amount of Sami loanwords have found their way into the dialects of Lappmark and the areas just to the south. For instance, the Siberian jay is locally called koxik as opposed to the Standard Swedish lavskrika. Below is a list of common subdialectal divisions of Norrland dialects. = Kalix dialects = These dialects, known in Swedish as kalixm√•l, are spoken in the medieval Kalix parishes (present-day Kalix and √ñverkalix municipalities). Like other dialects in Norrbotten, the Kalix dialects retain numerous archaic features. Many Old Norse diphthongs have been preserved, as well as archaic consonant clusters such as sj, stj and lj. The dative case is also retained, including following a preposition. Additionally, verbs at least partially retain their old plural forms. The Kalix dialect is further subdivided into * Upper Kalix dialect (√ñverkalixm√•l) * Lower Kalix dialect (Nederkalixm√•l) One difference between these two local variants is that the old consonant clusters mb, nd, and ng have been retained in Upper Kalix, but not in Lower Kalix. For example, the Standard Swedish kam (\\"comb\\" or \\"crest\\") is kemb in Upper Kalix, but kap in Lower Kalix. Furthermore, the Upper Kalix dialect has more influences from Sami languages and Me√§nkieli than other local dialects. = Lule√• dialects = The Lule√• dialects (Swedish: lulem√•l) are spoken in and around the mediaeval parish of Lule√• (present-day Boden and Lule√• municipalities). They are also spoken in the easternmost parts of Lule lappmark up to near Vuollerim. These dialects may be further subdivided as follows * Lower Lule√• dialect (in Lower Lule√• parish) * Upper Lule√• dialect (in Upper Lule√• parish) * R√•ne√• dialect (in R√•ne√• parish) The Lule√• dialects are known for, among other things, a rich inventory of diphthongs. The Old Norse ai, au, and √∂y are preserved, as well as ei (e.g., stein for Standard Swedish sten, meaning \\"stone\\"), eo (e.g., heok for Standard Swedish h√∂k, meaning hawk), and oi (e.g., hoi for Standard Swedish h√∂, meaning \\"hay\\"). These dialects also have a number of vowels that differ from Standard Swedish. For example, Standard Swedish i becomes √∂i (r√∂is instead of Standard ris, meaning \\"rice\\"), while Standard u becomes eo or eu (heos instead of Standard hus, meaning \\"house\\"). = Pite√• dialects = The Pite√• dialects (Swedish: pitem√•l) are spoken in the area of the mediaeval Pite√• parish (present-day Pite√• and √Ñlvsbyn municipalities) as well as in the southernmost parts of Jokkmokk Municipality and in northern Arvidsjaur Municipality in Pite lappmark. These dialects also preserve a number of archaic features, such as conserved diphthongs in words like g√∂uk (Standard Swedish: g√∂k, \\"cuckoo bird\\") and stein (Standard Swedish: sten, \\"stone\\"). The consonant clusters mb, nd, and ng are often retained, for example in kamb (Standard Swedish: kam, \\"comb\\"). Unique to the Pite√• dialects is that Old Swedish long \\"a\\" (modern \\"√•\\") has become short \\"a\\" before \\"n\\", but nowhere else. Thus, lan (Standard Swedish: l√•n\\", \\"loan\\"), but b√•t (Standard Swedish: b√•t, \\"boat\\"). = Settler dialects = The so-called \\"settler dialects\\" (Swedish: nybyggarm√•l) comprise all the Swedish dialects in Lappland; Karl-Hampus Dahlstedt geographically defines this dialect to those inland parts of Norrbotten where the Swedish dialects do not fit in with any of the relatively more clearly defined dialects of the coastal regions, due to the patchwork ancestry of the Swedish- speaking settlers that populated the area. One typical \\"settler dialect\\" is found in Arjeplog, which arose from a blending of Standard Swedish with the Pite√• and Ume√• dialects. There is also Sami influence on these dialects, such as the absence of the \\"thick L\\", which is generally typical of Norrland dialects. Another area in which a \\"settler dialect\\" is spoken is Malmf√§lten. = North Westrobothnian = North Westrobothnian (Swedish: nordv√§sterbottniska m√•l) is spoken in the northern parts of V√§sterbotten, primarily the mediaeval Skellefte√• parish (including Norsj√∂), together with a part of Pite lappmark (Mal√• and Arvidsjaur). Just like the coastal dialects of Norrbotten, North Westrobothnian preserves numerous archaic features. The dative case is still used, not only after prepositions but also after certain adjectives and verbs. Old Norse diphthongs have been preserved in many local dialects, but have developed in different, unique ways. For instance, Standard Swedish √∂ra (\\"ear\\") can be √∂√∂yr, √§√§yr, or aajr in various local dialects of North Westrobothnian. = South Westrobothnian = South Westrobothnian (Swedish: sydv√§sterbottniska m√•l) is spoken along the Ume River from Ume√• to T√§rna and Sorsele, including Bygde√• and Holm√∂n. A dialect is spoken in Lycksele lappmark which is highly reminiscent of dialects spoken in Ume√•, V√§nn√§s, and Degerfors (Vindeln). These influences become less apparent approaching the Norwegian border, but are still strong as far as T√§rna, where an old Ume√• substratum is evident. The local dialect of Sorsele is influenced by North Westrobothnian as well. South Westrobothnian also preserves archaic diphthongs, for instance in bein (Standard Swedish: ben, \\"leg\\") and √∂√∂ys (Standard Swedish: √∂sa, \\"to scoop\\"). This is a characteristic that distinguishes South Westrobothnian from the Nordmaling and Bjurholm variants of the √Öngermanland dialect to the south as well as a shared feature with North Westrobothnian. One difference between South and North Westrobothnian is that in South Westrobothnian, a \\"g\\" is often inserted between the old diphthong \\"au\\" and a following an \\"r\\" or \\"thick L\\". For example, South Westrobothnian √¥ger is aur in North Westrobothnian (Standard Swedish: √∂r, \\"gravelly ground\\"). = Transitional dialects between √Öngermanland and V√§sterbotten = These dialects, intermediate between South Westrobothnian and the √Öngermanland dialect, are spoken in Nordmaling and Bjurholm as well as √ñrtr√§sk. These dialects are similar to the dialect of nolaskogs, such as in the change of Old Norse hv- to gv- (gvit as opposed to Standard Swedish vit, meaning \\"white\\"). = √Öngermanland dialects = The √Öngermanland dialects (Standard Swedish: √•ngermanl√§ndska m√•l) are spoken in √Öngermanland (with the exception of Nordmaling and Bjurholm) and √Ösele lappmark. The dialects of √Ösele and Vilhelmina have largely retained their √Öngermanland character while still developing into their own. One exception is Fredrika parish, which developed a speech closer to Standard Swedish as a result of lying near major immigration routes from √Öngermanland. The dialect of Dikan√§s in Vilhelmina municipality is a transitional dialect between √Öngermanland and the dialects of Lycksele lappmark. The √Öngermanland dialects may be further subdivided as follows: *Dialects of √Ösele lappmark Vilhelmina dialect *Nolaskogs dialect *Dialects of √Ödalen = Medelpad = The Medelpad dialects (Swedish: medelpadsm√•l) are spoken in Medelpad, with the exception of the westernmost parish of Haver√∂, where the Hogdal dialects are spoken. In comparison to other Norrland dialects, the Medelpad dialects are relatively uniform. The most important outer isogloss is the one with the H√§lsing dialects to the south, which defines the limits of the \\"vowel balance\\" characteristic of Norrland dialects. One characteristic that distinguishes the Medelpad dialects (for example, Indal‚ÄìLiden) from other nearby dialects is the pronunciation of both short and long i and y as the same, the so-called \\"Viby I\\". In Borgsj√∂ and Torp, y is pronounced as i, while √∂ is pronounced closer to e. This trait is also found in the H√§lsing dialects and in parts of H√§rjedalen. Other traits are shared with the √Öngermanl√§nd dialects, like the \\"thick n\\" sound after long vowels in words such as van (\\"experienced\\", \\"habituated to\\") and m√•ne (\\"moon\\"). In the northernmost pars of Medelpad, the dialects show notable Jamtlandic influence. A characteristic typical for dialects of coastal Medelpad is short u in place of standard √∂. = J√§mtland = The Jamtlandic dialects (Swedish: j√§mtm√•l, j√§mtska) comprise the dialects of J√§mtland, with the exception of upper Frostviken, where the so-called Lid dialect (Lidm√•let) is spoken. These dialects are to a greater extent than other Norrland dialects caught between easterly (i.e., Swedish) and westerly (i.e., Norwegian) linguistic influences. Centuries-old cultural and linguistic (and later political) ties to Norway mean that many westerly linguistic traits that have long since disappeared in the coastal dialects are preserved in Jamtlandic. For example, the vowel u in words such as bu (Standard Swedish: bod, \\"hut\\"; cf. Norwegian: bu) and ku (Standard Swedish: ko, \\"cow\\"; cf. Norwegian: ku). Jamtlandic, like other Norrland dialects, also retains the archaic diphthongs of Old Norse. = Hogdal dialects = These dialects are spoken in Haver√∂ and Ytterhogdal. = H√§lsing dialects = The commonly accepted isogloss between Norrland dialects and Svealand Swedish runs through H√§lsingland. This area, however, is a typical transition region. From A Svealand standpoint, there are reasons to define the isogloss as coinciding with the southern border of H√§lsingland (through √ñdm√•rden). From a Norrland standpoint, there are alternative reasons to define it as coinciding with the southern border of Medelpad, which would fit with the southern limit of vowel balance. Included in the H√§lsing dialects are the Hassela dialect (Swedish: hasselam√•l) and the Forsa dialect (Swedish: forsam√•l).  Today  In Norrland, modern society has grown increasingly more fluid and interconnected, genuine local dialects are on the decline, like in many other parts of the world. Nevertheless, there often remains an unmistakable local character of the language, both among those who speak the pure dialect and among those who speak the regional standardised language. Aside from characteristic peculiarities in intonation, there are certain grammatical traits that seem likely to survive: the infinitive m√•sta (Standard Swedish: m√•ste), present tense forms such as han g√• (Standard Swedish: han g√•r, \\"he goes\\") and han ropa (Standard Swedish: han ropar, \\"he calls\\"), and the uninflected predicative in a statement such as dom √§ tr√∂tt (Standard Swedish: de √§r tr√∂tta, \\"they are tired\\").  Documentation and preservation  Nearly every small community traditionally has its own distinct dialect, and larger towns have had, for obvious reasons, greater linguistic influence. How well-documented various dialects are today is largely dependent on the work of a host of local enthusiasts, as well as some academic research in the area of Nordic languages, such as the series \\"Svenska Landsm√•l och svenskt folkliv\\" (\\"Swedish Dialects and Folk Traditions\\"), by professor J. A. Lundell at Uppsala universitet, where the Swedish Dialect Alphabet was used beginning in 1910 for the writing of various local dialects of Swedish. In many areas, the genuine dialects are nearly extinct, but a few others have achieved near-official status. One such example is Jamtlandic, which is taught in a relatively well developed written language to schoolchildren as has a wide variety of literature both in written and audio format.

He attended primary school in his hometown, then went on to Trujillo, where he attended secondary school at Colegio Seminario San Carlos y San Marcelo (1941‚Äì1945). In 1946 he entered the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, where he studied law and economics.

Due to his political activities, he was imprisoned for three months at El Front√≥n. He was the founder and president of the National Front of Democratic Youth (1955), which led to the candidacy of architect Fernando Belaunde Terry for the presidency in the 1956 general elections, in which he came in second place. This political grouping gave rise shortly afterwards to the Popular Action party, whose first Ordinary National Congress was held in 1957, at which Alva was elected a member of the Plenary. In 1958, his party commissioned him to draft the new Electoral Law, which was presented to the Senate. He was then appointed Secretary of Electoral Affairs (1959) and Assistant Secretary General (1961). During the 1962 general elections, and in his capacity as his party's representative, he denounced the alleged irregularities in the process, contributing to its annulment by the Armed Forces.

The station is also a terminus for the Lille Syd Line which connects Roskilde to N√¶stved by way of K√∏ge, and the Nordvest Line to Kalundborg. Completed in 1847, it is the oldest railway station in Denmark still in use. It was listed in 1964. History Roskilde station in 1849 with the loggia still intact Roskilde railway station was built as part of the Copenhagen- Roskilde Line, Denmark's first railway line, which was completed for the Zealand Railway Company (Det Sj√¶llandske Jernbaneselskab) by British engineering company William Redford. It was long thought that the construction company also designed the station in Roskilde but it has later been established that the architect was J.F. Meyer, a Dane. A target from Roskilde Shooting Society, depicting a scene from the loggia The design of the station is believed to have been inspired by Villa Borghese in Rome. Facing the city centre, the front of the original station building is symmetrical with two short rectangular towers with flat roofs flanking the main entrance. A loggia in front of the main entrance, now removed, was topped by a balcony in front of a restaurant. Roskilde station was inaugurated in connection with the opening of the railway line on 26 June 1847. Copenhagen Central Station has been moved twice since then, the current building being from 1911, making Roskilde station the oldest station building in the country though both the building and platforms have been expanded several times over the years. The station saw a major refurbishment from 1998 to 2002. The facade was brought back to its original colouring, the roof and tunnels were renovated, elevators and automatic doors were installed, and the arrival hall received new paving and furnishings.

Biography Born in Marseille on 24 June 1767, the son of Jacques-Joseph Eyri√®s, a \\"lieutenant de fr√©gates du roi\\" (\\"lieutenant of the king's frigates\\"), and Jeanne-Fran√ßoise Deluy (1748‚Äì1826). He moved to Le Havre in 1772 when his father was promoted to \\"commandant de la Marine\\" (\\"commander of the Navy\\"), and went to study at the College of Juilly. Eyri√®s began to travel to England, Germany, Sweden and Denmark to learn their languages and study botany and mineralogy, and through it grew to love geography and travel. Returning to Le Havre, he began working in the armaments trade, including commercial expeditions to various parts of the world, while taking care of a natural history museum there. In 1794 he went to Paris to deliver his father, who had been detained as a suspect in the new Republic, moving there the following year to devote himself to his studies, where he attended lectures by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu and Georges Cuvier, and started collecting old travel books. He was given a mission in 1804‚Äì1805 by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord and Napoleon to travel to Germany and rally the French emigrants there, chosen for his knowledge of the country and language and his discretion. He used the opportunity to continue his collection, but turned down the title \\"conseiller d‚Äô√âtat\\" (\\"councillor of the State\\") to keep his independence, allowing him to devote himself entirely to geography and botany, and return to Paris to settle. As a speaker of nine languages, he translated many articles and books from German, English and Scandinavian languages into French, mostly on travel and geography, but also including Fantasmagoriana from a selection of German ghost stories, which he published anonymously in 1812. From that year he became one of the drafters of the Biographie Universelle under editor Joseph Fran√ßois Michaud, writing many articles for it up until his death. His quality as a translator and extensive scientific knowledge earned him the friendship and admiration of many respected scientists, notably including Alexander von Humboldt and Conrad Malte-Brun, the latter of whom he joined in 1819 to continue the publication of Nouvelles Annales des Voyages, de la G√©ographie et de l‚ÄôHistoire, a journal dedicated to the advancement of the earth sciences. In 1821 he became one of the 217 founding members of the world's first geographical society, the Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie, remaining one of the most active and on its central committee until his death; he was named honorary president, a prestigious title given to the likes of Pierre-Simon Laplace, Georges Cuvier, Alexander von Humboldt and Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand. He was a recognised geographer, and Jules Dumont d'Urville named a mountain \\"Eyri√®s\\" after him near Humboldt Bay during his voyage on the Astrolabe. He was admitted to the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1839, and was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1844. Graville Priory in Le Havre, where Eyri√®s was buried in 1846.Eyri√®s suffered a stroke in 1844, rendering him incapable of further work, and died on 13 June 1846 at the house of his brother Alexandre Eyri√®s, the mayor of Graville near Le Havre, and was buried in the cemetery of Graville Priory, with an inscription on his tombstone after Edme Fran√ßois Jomard. He left a library of about 20,000 volumes collected throughout his life, which reflect his interest in rare and old works on travel and geography, and included almost everything written on Normandy, Le Havre and Provence, with rare maps from the German and Scandinavian countries, some of which are not even in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. Many of these books, and some of his manuscripts, remain as of 2006 in the municipal library of Le Havre, and a street \\"Rue Jean Baptiste Eyries\\" was named after him in the city. Eyri√®s was remembered by his contemporaries for his erudition, selfless dedication, prodigious memory, critical thinking and modesty, and Pierre Larousse wrote of him: \\"Many people still remember seeing a little old man in antiquated clothes, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and reading along the waterfront: that was Eyri√®s, who worked to fill his vast memory and his rich library at the same time.\\" Bibliography =As author= *Biographie Universelle, contributor, 1812 ff. *Abr√©g√© des Voyages Modernes Depuis 1780 Jusqu'√† Nos Jours, 14 volumes, 1822‚Äì1824 *Bibliomappe, ou Livre-cartes, textes analytiques, tableaux et cartes indiquant graduellement la g√©ographie naturelle, les divisions g√©ographiques, politiques, civiles, etc., les noms g√©ographiques, historiques de tous les √¢ges et de toutes les parties de l'univers, avec l'indication chronologique des d√©couvertes des navigateurs, des changements survenus dans la circonscription des √âtats, leurs d√©nominations, etc., with Jacques-Charles Bailleul and Pierre Claude Fran√ßois Daunou, 2 volumes, 1824‚Äì1826 *Abr√©g√© de g√©ographie moderne, ou Description historique, politique, civile et naturelle des empires, royaumes, √©tats et leurs colonies, avec celle des mers et des √Æles de toutes les parties du monde, with John Pinkerton and Charles Athanase Walckenaer, 2 volumes, 1827 *Recherches sur la population du globe terrestre, 1833 *Voyage pittoresque en Asie et en Afrique, r√©sum√© g√©n√©ral des voyages anciens et modernes, 1839 *L'Univers, histoire et description de tous les peuples : Danemark, 1846 *Dictionnaire de g√©ographie ancienne et moderne, with E.

It is located just off High Street, it is the parish church for the parish of Beighton and a Grade II* listed building. Although the original church dated from the 12th century there is no remaining trace of this original structure, although there are some later Medieval parts (see below). It is dedicated to Mary, the mother of Jesus. The present minister is Mike Healey. History and architecture Beighton was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 but there was no reference to any church in the settlement. It is believed that St. Mary‚Äôs dates from the year c.1150, this is based on the discovery of a disintegrating late Norman semi-circular chancel arch which was unearthed during late 19th century repair work. The first documented mention of the church is in an undated deed written during the reign of Edward I (1272-1307). At that time the church was dedicated to Saint Radegund who originated in Thuringia, there is no date for the change of dedication to St Mary and as late as 1557 there was a mention of \\"the churche yard of V(ir)gyn Radegond at Beghton\\". The tower arch is thought to be the oldest part of the present building and may date to the 13th century, while the north aisle dates from the 15th century, there was probably once a chantry chapel at its east end. There was a period of rebuilding and alteration towards the end of the 14th century that saw the addition of a pointed chancel arch and nave arcades. There was further restoration in 1773 but by the 1860s the church was in a dilapidated state and the newly appointed minister the Reverend George Antrobus employed the Chesterfield architect Samuel Rollinson (1827-1891) to oversee an extensive programme of reconstruction and renovation which took place between October 1867 and December 1868. The work included taking down the walls of the chancel and the south aisle and rebuilding them on the original footprint, the Clerestory windows to the nave were removed, and a gallery at the west end of the church was taken down. Bench pews replaced the box pews allowing for the capacity of the church to be increased to 291.\\"Listed Buildings In Sheffield\\", Barbara A. West, Hallamshire Press , Page 88, Gives historical details. The north door or Devil's door, was blocked up at one time and then later re-opened. The devil‚Äôs door was left ajar during baptisms to release any evil spirits in the child. On the north side of the chancel are two gravestones, one of these refers to the Jermyns, a wealthy family who owned property in Beighton, Hackenthorpe and Eckington. There is a Hagioscope or squint cut into the wall between the chancel and the nave, this enabled worshippers to see the priest‚Äôs actions indirectly. Two brasses on the south wall of the nave mark the resting places of William Jessoppe, vicar of Beighton, who died in 1667 and M. Robert Jessoppe of Waterthorp Gent who died in 1753. The rood was designed by Ninian Comper. Gives architectural details. In December 2006, Ed Dennison Archaeological Services Ltd were commissioned by the church council to conduct archaeological observations during internal refurbishment of the church and the replacement of the external drainage system. The result of this observation found no evidence of any remaining features connected with the original medieval church. The most noteworthy feature uncovered was the rediscovery of an early stone floor, last recorded in 1816 and buried in the 1867 restoration. The floor is thought to date from the early 16th century.

It was founded in 1965 as a chain. Originally, the hotel chain consisted of a hotel each in Berlin, Erfurt, Jena and Magdeburg, two hotels in Chemnitz (then Karl-Marx-Stadt) and five hotels in Leipzig. 5-star hotels were exclusively for guests from non- socialist states, 4-star hotels were mainly for guests from Comecon countries, for example, Park Inn Berlin (then Stadt Berlin) was built for Soviet people. There were also some 3-star hotels in smaller towns, such as \\"Hotel Elephant\\" in Weimar. Practically all luxury hotels in East Germany were part of the Interhotel chain, notable exceptions being hotel \\"Neptun\\" in Warnem√ºnde and Cecilienhof castle in Potsdam. The Verband Deutscher Konsumgenossenschaften (VDK), the union of consumer co-operatives in the GDR also ran hotels, mainly 4 star and three star hotels such as the Konsum Erholungsheim in Oberhof, which is still part of what remains of the co-operative movement in Germany. After German reunification, most of the hotels were still run by Interhotel AG. In 1991, some hotels were sold to the Klingbeil group, and in December 2006 some were sold to the Blackstone Group. The Interhotel hotels were under the control of the East German state security service, the Stasi, under the Tourist Department.

A dual Olympian and two time bronze medal winner at World Championships, he has set and holds world records in indoor rowing with times set on the Concept 2 rowing machine. Education Loch began his rowing at the King's School in Sydney and was in the stroke seat of the school's 2001 First VIII which won 28 races from 28 starts including the AAGPS Head of the River. This crew also contained future Australian senior national rowers Nicholas Hudson and Matt Ryan, and went on to win the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at the 2001 Henley Royal Regatta. Loch studied and rowed at Princeton University from which he graduated in 2006. Club and state rowing Domestically Loch enjoyed great success as a member of the New South Wales King's Cup crew. Loch was a member of the crew in 2008 which defeated holders, Victoria, by just 0.21 seconds in a win that saw New South Wales start their own winning streak from 2008 to 2014 inclusive. Loch recorded six wins in this event from 2008 to 2013. His senior club in Sydney was the UTS Haberfield Rowing Club. International representative rowing Loch made his Australian team debut at the 2007 World Rowing Championships in Munich, Germany. Competing in the Men's Coxless Four, his crew placed 12th.

It is the parish church of Gilsland, but is almost a mile from the village and may have been intended as much for the use of visitors to the nearby Gilsland Spa hotel as for the village. It is noteworthy in that the founder, G.G. Mounsey, a local landowner and first elected mayor of Carlisle, published a detailed summary of his reasons for building the church and thus threw into relief some of the reasoning behind Victorian church building and restoration.Mounsey, G.G. c1865. Gillesland: a brief Historical and Statistical Notice of its Locality and Mineral Waters; Printed at the ‚ÄúExpress‚Äù Office, by John Irving Lonsdale, CarlisleGillesland online www.laverocks.co.uk/mounsey/gillesland.htm Services at St Mary Magdalene's are conventionally Anglican in character, with an emphasis on informality. History The church was started in 1851 but not consecrated until Oct 3rd 1854. It was built, at a cost of ¬£800, and partly endowed by George Gill Mounsey of Rockcliffe, Carlisle who also erected the nearby Gilsland Spa Hotel in 1860. He employed the same architect, Mr. James Stewart of Carlisle for both of these buildings. A new parish of Gilsland was created for the church, derived from the parish of Lanercost. It is 18,240 acres in area, stretching some 13 miles north of the village to the borders of Kielder Forest and south to the A69. To the east the parish abuts Greenhead parish in the diocese of Newcastle and in the west the parish of Nether Denton. George Mounsey sets the founding of the church in a wider historical context in his book. He points out how, after the destruction of nearby Lanercost Priory by Henry VIII, no provision was made to replace the ministry provided by the monks to the surrounding area and suggests that there was a decline in moral standards as a consequence. Mounsey provides evidence that priests assigned to the parish found it difficult to support themselves from the scanty tithes available and that his foundation and endowment of St Mary Magdalene's was an attempt to rectify the situation. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built of rough stone to a simple layout in Early English style. It has a large porch on the south side of the nave and the corbels supporting the arch of the doorway have carvings of the heads of Bishop Waldegrave and Queen Victoria. Two other heads adorn the east wall, one of which appears to represent St Mary Magdalene. There is a small belfry containing one bell made by J Blaylock in 1852, bearing the Latin inscription \\"Soli Deo Laus Hominibus Pax\\" (Peace to men, praise to God alone). The stained glass window behind the altar and the two windows in the west wall were made by Scott of Carlisle. The window above the altar depicts St Mary Magdalene, to whom this church is dedicated. She is shown holding a white lily, her emblem. The two west windows show St Peter and St Paul. All three originally formed panels of one large west window in Rockcliffe church and were brought from there by George Mounsey when the Rockcliffe window was being altered. The Mary Magdalene panel was shorter than the aperture it was fitted into and the extra length had to be filled with plain glass. =Interior= The stone pulpit and font are contemporary with the church. In the Chancel is the two-manual organ by Harrison and Harrison of Durham, which was installed in 1901 at a cost of ¬£172. The carved oak choir stalls together with the prayer desk near the font were made by Mr. James Wilson, a local joiner who lived in Mumps Hall in the village. He also carved the oak chancel screen, the top of which was removed in 1958 and now forms the front of the altar.Bird, W.G. 1913. Gilsland and Neighbourhood; Gregg, Gilsland The oak reredos and panelling are in memory of George Mounsey, founder of the church. A brass plaque in his commemoration can be found on the panelling to the right of the organ. There is a second plaque, nearer the organ, in memory of the former organist and choir master, W.R. Wright, son of the vicar Adam Wright mentioned on the lectern.

In a racing career lasting from August 1959 until October 1960, the filly ran nine times and won four races. As a two-year-old she proved herself capable of competing against the leading French colts by winning the Prix de la Salamandre at Longchamp and being narrowly beaten in the Grand Crit√©rium. In the following year she was sent to Britain where she won the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket and Oaks at Epsom. She was then retired to stud at the end of her three-year-old season, and had some success as a broodmare. Background Never Too Late was a small chestnut filly bred by her owner Mrs Howell E. (Dorothy) Jackson's Bull Run Stud. Never Too Late's dam, Gloria Nicky was the top-rated British two-year-old filly of 1954, when her wins included the Cheveley Park Stakes. She was a half sister to Libra, a mare who produced the St Leger Stakes winners Ribocco and Ribero. Gloria Nicky was pregnant with her first foal (Never Too Late) when she was sold to Mrs Jackson for ¬£30,000 in 1956. Never Too Late was from the second crop of foals sired by The Derby winner Never Say Die. The filly was sent to be trained in France by Etienne Pollet. When racing in Britain, the filly was known as Never Too Late II. Racing career Never Too Late began her racing career in August 1959 when she finished fifth in a maiden race at Deauville-La Touques Racecourse before winning a similar event at Longchamp. In September she was stepped up markedly in class to contest the Prix de la Salamandre. The race at Longchamp was open to both colts and fillies and attracted a field which included the Prix Morny winner Pharamond. Never Too Late won the 1400m event, beating Pharamond into second. A month later, Never Too Late was again matched against colts in the Grand Crit√©rium over 1600m. On this occasion she finished second, beaten a short neck to Angers, a colt who started favourite for the 1961 Epsom Derby. Never Too Late began her three-year-old season in the Prix Imprudence at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse, which she won impressively by four lengths from Paola. The filly was then sent to England to contest the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile. Ridden by Roger Poincelet she started 8/11 favourite against thirteen opponents. She took the lead a furlong from the finish and won easily by two lengths from Lady In Trouble and Running Blue. Never Too Late returned to Britain a month later and started 6/5 favourite. The finish of the race was rough and controversial. Poincelet held the favourite up towards the back of the field, and struggled to obtain a clear run before making his challenge on the outside in the straight. As she moved up to the French-trained leader Paimpont, Never Too Late hung to the left and blocked the run of a third French filly, Imberline. Never Too Late caught Paimpont in the closing strides and won by a head, with Imberline an apparently unlucky third. After the race, Poincelet alleged that some of the British jockeys had deliberately hampered his progress on three separate occasions, while Etienne Pollet claimed that the filly would have won by six lengths with a clear run. In September, Never Too Late ran in the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp. Racing on soft ground, she did not reproduce her earlier form and finished unplaced behind Leghinka. On her final appearance, Never Too Late was sent to England for a third time to contest the Champion Stakes at Newmarket. She finished second to the Italian filly Marguerite Vernaut. Retirement Never Too Late returned to America to become a broodmare. The best of her offspring was Without Fear, a colt sired by Baldric, who won the Prix Herod and became a leading sire in Australia. Her female-line descendants include the VRC Oaks winner Lovelorn. Assessment and honours Never Too Late was given a Timeform rating of 130 in 1959, when she was the highest rated two-year-old filly in Europe. She was rated 128 in 1960. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Never Too Late a \\"superior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks. Pedigree Never Too Late was inbred 4x4 to Blenheim, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

He is a dual Olympian and Olympic silver medal winner from Melbourne, Australia. Club and state career Born in Melbourne, Booth was educated at Deepdene Primary School and learnt to row at Scotch College in Melbourne. He studied medicine at Melbourne University. Booth's senior club rowing was from the Melbourne University Boat Club. On nine consecutive occasions from 2011 to 2019 Booth was seated in the Victorian men's eight who contested the King's Cup at Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships.Guerin Foster Aust Rowing History In those crews he saw two King's Cup victories in 2015 & 2016 (both with Booth at stroke) and six second places. International representative rowing Booth made his Australian representative debut in 2010 when selected in the Australian men's U23 eight to contest the World Rowing U23 Championships in Brest, Bulgaria. That crew finished in ninth place. That same year he was picked in a senior Australian coxless four who placed seventh at the 2010 World Rowing Championships in Lake Karapiro. In 2011 Booth secured a seat in the Australian men's senior eight. They raced at the World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne before contesting the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, Slovenia and finishing in fourth place. In the 2012 Olympic year Booth held his seat in the eight rowing at two World Rowing Cups in the Olympic lead up. He rowed in the six seat of the men's eight at the 2012 Summer Olympics to a sixth placing. After appearing in the event, he was expelled from the Australian team as a result of an incident in which he broke windows at two small businesses in the Surrey town of Egham while drunk. Having apologised and paid damages to the owner of the damaged properties, he was released without charge by British police. Booth continued to row at the highest Australian level from the first year of the new Olympiad. He was selected in a coxless four for the 2013 World Rowing Cup I in Sydney and then in 2014 at the World Rowing Cup I he raced in both the Australian eight and in a coxless four. However, in neither of those years did he represent at a World Championship. In 2015 he was back in the Australian senior eight for the World Rowing Cup III and then for the 2015 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette where the eight finished in ninth place. In 2016 along with Josh Dunkley-Smith, Will Lockwood and Alexander Hill, Booth was selected in the Australian men's coxless four to compete at Rio 2016. They won their heat and semi-final and took the silver medal in the final behind Great Britain.Booth at World Rowing In their second regatta of the 2018 international season and in an Australian selection eight racing as the Georgina Hope Rinehart National Training Centre, in honour of Rowing Australia patron, Gina Rinehart, Booth won the 2018 Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The fourth Australian men's eight to ever do so. The following week at the World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne, Booth rowed in the Australian eight to silver medal in a thrilling 0.14 second finish behind Germany. The stage was set for the close competition that played out at the 2018 World Championships in Plovdiv. In their heat the Australian eight finished 5/100ths of a second behind the US and then in the final, Germany dominated and took gold but 2/10ths of a second separated 2nd through to 4th and the Australians took silver, a bowball ahead of Great Britain with the US out of the medals. Booth rowed at seven and came home with a silver world championship medal. In 2019, Booth was again selected in the Australian men's sweep squad for the international representative season. In an effort to qualify the men's pair for the 2020 Olympics, different combinations were tried. At the World Rowing Cup II in Poznan and rowing behind the dual world champion Alex Hill, Booth won a gold medal in the Australian men's coxless pair. For the WRC III in Rotterdam, Booth was back in the Australian eight which rowed to 6th place. Booth was then selected to race in the Australian men's eight at the 2019 World Rowing Championships in Linz, Austria.2019 WRC entry list The eight were looking for a top five finish at the 2019 World Championships to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics.2019 World C'ship selections The eight placed second in their heat and fourth in the final and qualified for Tokyo 2020.

Lister made his first state crew for New South Wales in 2005 in the youth eight which contested the Noel Wilkinson Trophy at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships.2005 Interstate Regatta - Australian Rowing History He was again in New South Wales youth eights in 2006 and 2007, steering both those crews to victory.2007 Interstate Regatta - Australian Rowing History Following the retirement of fellow SUBC coxswain Marty Rabjohns in 2008, Lister stepped into the stern of the New South Wales men's senior eight to contest the King's Cup at the annual Interstate Regatta. He enjoyed a sustained period of New South Wales dominance in this event and coxed six successive NSW eights to King's Cup victories from 2009 to 2014. Lister also coxed the 2015 New South Wales King's Cup eight to a second place - their first loss in the event in eight years.2015 Interstate Regatta In SUBC colours Lister coxed crews contesting national titles at the Australian Rowing Championships on a number of occasions. In 2006 he steered the SUBC lightweight eight competing for that national title 2006 Austn C'ships and in 2007 a composite New South Wales crew in that same event.2007 Austn C'ships In 2009 he coxed SUBC crews contesting the coxed four championship and the open women's eight event.2009 Austn C'ships - all results In 2006 he coxed a composite SUBC/Uni of Queensland/UTS crew to victory as the champion Australian coxed four.2006 Austn C'ships That crew contained the Winklevoss twins who at the time were rowing with the UTS Haberfield Rowing Club. In 2008 he again won an Australian championship coxed four title, this time in an all Sydney University crew.2008 Austn C'ships International representative rowing In 2004 Lister made his Australian representative debut at the Junior World Rowing Championships in Banyoles, Spain, in the coxed four which placed sixth. In 2007, Lister was one of seven athletes from Sydney University Boat Club selected to the Australian U23 men's eight. The crew was coached by SUBC coach Phil Bourguignon and won a bronze medal at the 2007 U23 World Rowing Championships in Strathclyde, Scotland. In 2008, Lister coxed the Australian U23 eight to seventh place at the U23 World Championships in Brandenburg, Germany. Upon Rabjohns' retirement Lister took the ropes of the national men's senior eight. He steered the eight to a seventh placing at the 2009 World Rowing Championships in Poznan, Poland. In 2010, Lister won his first senior world championship medal, a bronze, in the men's eight at the 2010 World Rowing Championships on Lake Karapiro, New Zealand. At the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, Slovenia, with Lister on the rudder the Australian men's eight placed 4th and qualified that boat for the London Olympics. At the 2012 London Olympics, Lister coxed the Australian men's eight to a sixth placing in a thrilling final where all boats finished within a length at the line. Coaching Lister was the Director of Rowing at Scotch College, Adelaide and led the program to wins in the first VIII for Schoolboys and Schoolgirls at the 2015 South Australian Head of the River. It was the first time in the school's history this has occurred.

As an artist, she is best known for co-founding the collaborative performance art group The Feminist Art Workers in 1976 with Candace Compton, Cheri Gaulke, and Laurel Klick. After studying photography in Denmark and attending San Francisco Art Institute, Angelo moved to Los Angeles in 1975 in order to enroll in the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman‚Äôs Building. She took an active part in refurbishing the old three-story structure on North Spring Street near Chinatown that housed the Woman‚Äôs Building and making it suitable for learning and practicing art. Career =Feminist Art Workers= Shortly after enrolling in the FSW, Angelo immersed herself in performance art and in 1976 she co-founded Feminist Art Workers with Cheri Gaulke, Laurel Klick, and Candace Compton (later replaced by Vanalyne Green). In an attempt to mobilize the strategies of feminist education in the field of performance art, the Feminist Art Workers used performance to create an empowering network for women in and outside of Los Angeles. In 1978, FAW created Traffic in Women: A Feminist Vehicle (1978), performed at various sites between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Prior to embarking on this project, the group conducted research on the subject of prostitution and the actual traffic in women between these two cities. In 1980, FAW embarked on an even more ambitious project, Bill of Rights, which the group performed from 1980 to 1982 in 15 states that have not passed the Equal Rights Amendment at the time. This project emerged on the heels of major demonstration in Washington, D.C., which took place in 1978 when 100,000 marched the streets demanding equal rights. It was just one of many efforts, initiated by feminists across the nation, to ensure the ratification of ERA by 1982. =Video art= In 1976, Angelo and Compton directed Nun and Deviant, considered by many to be the key text of the feminist video art. By taking on the roles of a nun (Angelo) and a deviant (Compton), the two artists reflected on ‚Äúprototypical or actual lesbian models.‚Äù At this time, Angelo‚Äôs experiments in performance art coincided with her involvement with local video production. Thus, during the same year, Angelo, Annette Hunt, Candace Compton, and Jerri Allyn established the Los Angeles Women‚Äôs Video Center, located at the Woman‚Äôs Building. LWVC supported the work of prominent feminist video-makers such as Cheri Gaulke, Suzanne Lacy, and Vanalyne Green. During the first decade of its existence, some 350 videotapes were produced. =Collaborative work= In 1979, Angelo took part in An Oral Herstory of Lesbianism, initiated by Terry Wolverton and performed at the Woman‚Äôs Building. Apart from Angelo, the event involved many other participants in LA performance art scene: Cheri Gaulke, Jerri Allyn, Leslie Belt, Chutney Gunderson, Brook Hallock, Sue Maberry, Louise Moore, Arlene Raven, Catherine Stifter, Cheryl Swannack, and Christine Wong. At the time, Wolverton was involved with the Lesbian Art Project at the Woman‚Äôs Building and she proposed to create Herstory in an effort to ‚Äúchronicle the lives of lesbians.‚Äù The project opened with ten workshops devoted to teaching performance skills and techniques as well as to exploring issues of lesbianism. During the same year, Angelo and Leslie Labowitz initiated the Incest Awareness Project, a collaboration between Ariadne: A Social Art Network and the Women's Resources Program of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center (of which Angelo was a member). The project attracted a large number of feminist artists including Leslie Belt, Jerri Allyn, Paula Lumbard, Bia Lowe, Terry Wolverton, Tyaga, Chris Wong, and many others. As a part of her involvement in the project, Angelo produced and exhibited Equal Time/Equal Space, an interactive multi-monitor video work. Committed to shedding light on violence against women, her project invited open dialogue on the subject of incest at the time when it was not publicly discussed. In 1981, Angelo co-founded another performance group, Sisters of Survival (SOS) that focused on anti-nuclear issues. The group formed after the dissolution of Feminist Art Workers, when two former FAW members, Gaulke and Angelo, decided to join forces with members of another LA-based group, The Waitresses. The original lineup included Angelo, Gaulke, Jerri Allyn, Anne Gauldin, and Sue Maberry. As a part of their performance, the members of SOS ‚Äúdressed in nun‚Äôs habits of all colors of the rainbow to represent an image of ‚Äòglobal sisterhood.‚Äô‚Äù =Current work= After leaving Sisters of Survival and ending her association with the Woman‚Äôs Building, Angelo decided to continue her education and obtain a PhD in organizational psychology from the California School of Professional Psychology in Los Angeles. Currently, she lives in the Bay Area and provides organization development services as a part of Angelo + Garnets consulting firm. Bibliography * Cottingham, Laura.

Using the CTB, one could write an application that would seamlessly work over AppleTalk, a modem or any variety of other connections. Developers could also write plug-in communications modules known as \\"Tools\\", allowing any CTB-aware application to use that connection method. CTB was notoriously slow and buggy,Mark Anbinder, \\"IE To The Rescue\\", TidBITS, 13 January 1992 and received mixed support from developers.\\"Ingemar's Corner, 25 December 2002 Examples of applications using it for simple tasks were common, but many target uses, like terminal emulators, almost always ran faster when designed to target a single connection type and avoid the CTB. Description The CTB was based on a shared library concept in an era when the Mac OS did not include a shared library system. Instead, the CTB wrote its own driver manager layer, the Communications Resource Manager. The Resource Manager was responsible for installing and managing the various drivers, or \\"Tools\\" that provided various functions within the CTB system. There were three primary types of Tools, each with their own associated Manager: the Connection Manager handled the communications drivers that opened channels to remote services, the Terminal Manager managed Tools that implemented the character conversion and command string interpretation needed to support any sort of terminal emulator, and the File Transfer Manager did the same for any sort of file transfer protocol. Applications could use any, or all, of the Managers in the CTB. A typical terminal emulator would use all of them, connecting a Tool selected in the Connection Manager to another in the Terminal Manager, and then periodically using the File Transfer Manager on user request. Such was the case for common terminal emulators like VersaTerm and MacTerminal.Mark Anbinder, \\"TelePort Capabilities\\", TidBITS, 23 September 1991 However, another application might use only one of these, say the Connection Manager to set up communications. QuickMail and Eudora are well- known examples.Adam Engst, \\"Shell Account Enhancements\\" , Internet Starter Kit for Macintosh, 1996, Chapter 14 Applications typically used the GUI elements supplied by the Managers to handle user interaction, but could also enumerate the tools on their own to provide a custom GUI. Perhaps the best known Tool was the Apple Modem Tool, which provided the serial communications drivers as well as a system for storing setup commands. When a connection was initiated using the Modem Tool, the link to the modem was opened, commands sent to it, and the link established by dialling. The Modem Tool was also indicative of the problems that the CTB had in general; it was slow and lacking in features, quickly became outdated as modem speeds improved, and saw little development effort or support. When a 1.5 version addressing some of the problems was released in 1993, even finding it proved difficult.Adam Engst, \\"Apple Modem Tool 1.5\\", TidBITS, 25 October 1993 A further update was needed to support higher speeds when 28kbit/s modems become common.\\"What is the maximum throughput of the Apple Modem Tool?\\", Apple Computer, 17 May 1996 Apple also produced the simple Serial Tool and AppleTalk Tools as additional connection methods, the TTY and VT102 Tools for terminal emulation, and the Text and XModem tools for file transfers.See various sections of Inside the Comm Toolbox Third party tools were common for supporting connections, including the TelePort modem which plugged into the Apple Desktop Bus and thus required custom drivers, Apple's own X.25 and ISDN tools, and a variety of other examples.

Early life He was the son of wealthy parents. He entered the priesthood at a young age and seemed destined for priesthood. Murder of Giovanni Montolesi He seduced a young woman who was engaged to Giovanni Montolesi, the son of a wealthy merchant. When Montolesi learned of the affair, he sought out Annunchiarico and reproached him for bringing shame to the priesthood and dishonor to his fianc√©e. Without a word, Annunchiarico drew a dagger from his belt and stabbed Montolesi in the heart. He later swore a blood-feud against the entire Montolesi family, declaring that the man whom he had murdered had insulted him and the entire Roman Catholic priesthood. Over the next few months he ambushed and murdered thirteen members of the Montolesi clan. Pursued by the authorities, he then fled with some friends into the mountains. Gang leader After thirteen years on the run he organized, in late 1816 and 1817, a confederation of robbers with a strength of 20,000 people. The name they used for themselves was Decisi, The Decided Ones of Jupiter the Thunderer. Their leader Ciro Annunchiarico claimed to be the earthly avatar of the ancient Roman god Jupiter. The area they laid claim to they called the Salentinian Republic. Charisma He seemed to have had an extraordinary if not mysterious power of charisma, as tens of thousands of hardened bandits readily obeyed him and acknowledged his bizarre claims. Further murders He is supposed to have killed between sixty and seventy men by his own hand. Execution On February 27th 1818 his last stronghold, between Tarent and Brindisi, was stormed by a force of German and Swiss mercenaries under the command of an Englishman, General Richard Church.

Early life The sixth son of Scottish nobleman and politician Thomas Cochrane, 8th Earl of Dundonald, by his second wife Jane Stuart, Cochrane was probably named for his father's brother Basil Cochrane (died 1788), at the time Governor of the Isle of Man and later a member of the Scottish Board of Customs. At the age of sixteen Basil was given a place in the East India Company in Madras. From 1783‚Äì5 he served as a revenue administrator in Nagapattinam, which had been seized from the Dutch in 1781. During his time there he was accused of having two locals, including one named Vaidyanada, beaten to death. After a trial in Madras in 1787, he was acquitted by a British jury. Nabob In 1792 Basil Cochrane took over supply contracts for the British navy in India from his brother John, who had held them since 1790.\\"Basil Cochrane and the Victualling of the Fleet in the East Indies, 1792‚Äì1806\\" in Sustaining the Fleet, 1793‚Äì1815: War, the British Navy and the Contractor State, Roger Knight and Martin Wilcox, 2010, Boydell Press, Woodbridge, p. 164 The demand for provisions was so great that Basil had flour mills and bakeries built at Calcutta and Madras to fulfill his contracts. He also financed \\"Cochrane's Canal\\" (now the Buckingham Canal) which improved navigation to Madras. The contract was rebid in 1803 and Cochrane again won the bid. In 1806 Cochrane handed over the contracts to the partnership of James Baker and James Balfour.

He built a large house at 12 Portman Square, where he was able to socialise with his brother Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone, his nephew Lord Cochrane, and others. In 1807 he financed the campaigns of his brothers Andrew and George in the notorious rotten borough of Grampound to place them in Parliament, perhaps to increase pressure on the government to settle his accounts. He purchased, with partner George Hunter, the Scottish estate of Auchterarder in 1808 and assumed the titles. After Cochrane's accounts were settled in 1819, he published several works criticising the Victualing Board's conduct towards him and calling for reforms in the process.

The company provides FDIC-insured checking accounts to US citizens and Permanent Residents through a partnership with BBVA USA and is part of the STAR network for surcharge-free access to around 55,000 ATMs. Since 2014, Simple has been part of the BBVA Group, one of the largest banks in Europe. History Simple's logo from 2011 to 2016. What was initially known as BankSimple was founded in 2009 in Brooklyn by former CTO Alex Payne, CEO Joshua Reich and CFO Shamir Karkal. The initial seed capital was provided by angel investor Jerry Neumann. In August 2011, the company raised $10 million from investors led by IA Ventures, Shasta Ventures and Dave McClure's fund 500 Startups. Later that month, the company moved its headquarters to Portland, where five of the company's 17 employees already resided. The company launched in the summer of 2012 as a limited beta. By January 2013, the company had 20,000 customers and had processed more than $200 million in transactions. By July 2013, its customers had increased to 40,000 and total transaction values increased to greater than $1 billion. At year's end in 2013, Simple reported processing on average around 13 debit transactions per minute with an overall customer balance of $64 million. On February 20, 2014, Simple announced it had been acquired by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA). Paying through its US subsidiary BBVA Compass., BBVA acquired Simple for $117 million or about $1200 per customer. BBVA was also part of the initial venture funding; it originally became interested in Simple in 2011 when a co-founder of Simple criticized the technology of banks and their approach to customer service. On May 14, 2018, co-founder Reich announced his plans to step down as the company's CEO. In February of 2020, Simple announced that its automated, round up savings feature had saved customers 1.2 million dollars in less than 4 months since the feature was introduced. Business model In contrast with traditional consumer banks, Simple has no physical branches. Instead, account-holders are issued Visa debit cards and have access to an online banking system accessible through Simple.com or mobile apps for Android or iOS. Simple earns revenue by collecting interest on customer deposits and through the collection of interchange fees. Features *Simple mobile apps became available for iOS and Android in May 2011 and January 2013, respectively. *Checks up to $9,500 USD are deposited through Simple's smartphone apps, or for any amount by postal mail or express courier. This amount that a customer is eligible to deposit at one time varies based upon length of time with the account has been open and number of checks previously deposited. All deposits are subject to a hold, regardless of customer status. *A bill pay service prints checks and mails them to specified recipients. Previously, Simple did not provide blank checks for customers, nor did it honor checks printed by a third party. However, in February 2018, a limited beta program was rolled out to specific customers which gave customers the ability to request free books of 25 checks via mail, with no fees associated with ordering or banking (i.e. returned checks or NSF fees). This program is currently in beta phase and is gradually being rolled out to users throughout the first half of 2018. Simple‚Äôs ‚ÄúBill Pay‚Äù service was shut down on July 9, 2019. *Simple's online banking interface integrates hashtag searching, memos and location-based information for users' transaction history. *Using the Goals feature, account holders are able to schedule automatic savings on a daily basis. *Using the Expenses feature, account holders are able to schedule automatic goal allocations for the purposes of paying bills.

She is the 2012 Olympic Champion in the Women's Sabre Individual Fencing. Kim is the first South Korean woman to win an Olympic gold medal in fencing and the second South Korean female fencer to win any Olympic medal after Nam Hyun-hee, who won silver in 2008. She is also the second South Korean fencer to win a gold medal at the Summer Olympics, following male foil fencer Kim Young-ho. Biography Kim began fencing at age 13 as a foil fencer, but converted to sabre in high school at age 16 in 2004. Although she first became a member of the South Korean national fencing team at the age of 18 in 2006, Kim was often overshadowed by fellow sabre fencers Kim Hye-lim, Lee Shin-mi and Kim Keum-hwa, omitted from the final national squad before becoming a fixture in the 2011 season. Kim began to garner international attention at the 2011 Summer Universiade where she won the bronze medal in the women's individual sabre fencing. In the semifinals, Kim lost to two-time European champion and eventual gold medalist Olha Kharlan of Ukraine 15-10. She accumulated another bronze medal in the women's team sabre as a member of Team South Korea. Kim finished the 2011 season as her first full-time member of the national team, and her FIE ranking rose from 174 to 11. In February 2012, Kim reached the semifinals at the Orl√©ans Grand Prix, her first international tournament of the 2012 season. Next month, Kim reached her first individual sabre final at the Antalya World Cup in Turkey. In May 2012, Kim became a semi-finalist at the Bologna World Cup in Italy and the Tianjin Grand Prix in China in a row. Her success in these tournaments increased her FIE ranking to 5th before the start of the 2012 Olympics. =2012 Olympics= Kim competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London capturing the gold medal in the women's individual sabre event. This was South Korea's second Olympic gold medal in fencing, Kim Young-ho having won the men's foil Gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Kim reached the final when she defeated two-time Olympic individual sabre champion Mariel Zagunis 15‚Äì13 in the semifinal match. Largely regarded as the underdog by both competitors and her teammates, she came back from a 12‚Äì5 deficit against Zagunis to advance into the finals. Kim beat Russia's Sofya Velikaya, the reigning world champion, 15‚Äì9 in the gold medal match. Kim asserted her dominance early in the contest, with her opponent having little say in the outcome of the first period with an 8‚Äì5 triumph for Kim. Velikaya struggled to recover from the setback and the second period followed in much the same way as the first as Kim won 7‚Äì4 to win the gold medal.

They follow the Rule of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis. Foundation Jos√© Mar√≠a Amig√≥ y Ferrer was born in Massamagrell (Valencia - Spain) on October 17, 1854. As a student at the Theological Seminary, he would volunteer at various hospitals. In 1874, he joined a Capuchin monastery located in the city of Bayonne, with the name of Fray Luis de Masamagrell.Religious Tertiary Capuchins He was ordained in March 1879 at the friary of Montehano de Escalante in Santander, Spain. In 1885 he founded a religious institute of women, called the Capuchin Tertiary Sisters of the Holy Family. This was followed in 1889 by the friars. The friars were founded by Bishop , O.F.M. Cap., (1854 - 1934) on April 12,1889, in Massamagrell, in the Province of Valencia, Spain. Amig√≥, a Capuchin friar, had a ministry of service to the prisons. In the course of this work, he frequently found boys, even pre-teenagers, locked up as prisoners, due to the poverty of their families. He wanted to give these boys the support they needed to break out of this cycle of poverty. To this end, Amig√≥ established the friars to provide institutions of care and training for poor boys. The first group of 19 novices for the new institute made their first religious profession on June 24, 1890. They established several reform schools and orphanages. Early in their history, the friars developed a particular program of education for their schools, which they term \\"Amigonian Pedagogy\\". It is based on the Gospels, having as its principal models the images of the Good Shepherd, the lost sheep and the Good Samaritan. Its goal is \\"the re-education, rehabilitation, correction and reform of children and youth who, for diverse factors, have come into conflict with themselves and with society.Religiosos Amigonianos \\"¬øQu√© hacemos?\\" Spirituality The friars follow a spirituality based in the vision of St. Francis of Assisi, given to them by their founder, a Capuchin Friar Minor. They also model themselves on the role of Our Lady of Sorrows, who stood at the foot of the Cross, sharing her son's agony and love for the world. She is a model to the friars of the generosity, mercy, strength and tenderness needed in the mission of serving their charges.Religiosos Amigonianos: \\"Nuestra espiritualidad\\" Apostolate The friars run a children's home in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.\\"Between Two Worlds\\", Bayer Magazine There is also a group of laypeople who support and work with the Amigonian Friars and Religious Sisters. Young people are organized to help in the mission of the institute into Amigonian Youth. Together all these various fruits of the work of Amig√≥ form the \\"Amigonian Family\\".Religiosos Amigonianos \\"Nosotros-Familia\\" Martyrs During the Spanish Civil War, the institutions of the friars throughout Spain were closed by various militias associated with the Second Spanish Republic. Many of the friars were arrested, and 19 were executed in various locations throughout the country during the summer of 1936. They are honored as martyrs for the Catholic faith and have been declared venerable by the Catholic Church.Religiosos Amigianos: \\"M√°rtires\\" Presence The friars today serve on four continents, and in the Philippines. In Spain, they run about 20 institutions of education and social service. Outside of Spain there is one community each in Ivory Coast and Poland, with another two communities in Germany.

Career In 2011, he played in British Darts Organisation (BDO) tournament World Masters where he beat Scott Mitchell 3 legs to 0 and Paul Hogan whom he beat by 3 legs to 1 before losing in the last 24 to Andrew Gilding of England. He lost in the last 64 of the 2011 UK Open after falling to Michael van Gerwen 9 legs to 2, after beating Stephen Hardy and Tony Ayres. In 2012, Howson won a PDC tour card on the first day of Q School. His best result of 2012 was reaching the quarter-finals of the sixth UK Open Qualifier where he lost 6‚Äì2 to Ian White. Howson again lost in the last 64 of the UK Open, in a 2‚Äì9 defeat to Andy Hamilton. He was ranked world number 69 going into 2013. Howson played in all eight of the UK Open Qualifiers with his best results being two last 32 defeats to qualify for the event itself where he lost in the last 64 for the third successive year this time 9‚Äì2 to Matt Padgett. The rest of the year proved to be disappointing for Howson as he failed to qualify for any European Tour events and could not advance beyond the last 64 in the 14 Players Championships he competed in. He begun 2014 89th in the world, well outside the top 64 who kept their PDC places and Howson therefore entered Q School to win his place back. He lost in the last 32 on the third day but couldn't advance beyond the last 256 in any of the other days to fall short of earning a new tour card. Howson now had PDPA Associate Member status which allowed him entry into all UK Open and European Tour qualifiers as well as the Challenge Tour. Howson failed to qualify for the UK Open for the first time, but made the most out of an appearance at the final Players Championship of the year with wins over Mark Dudbridge, Terry Jenkins, Keegan Brown and Christian Kist to reach his second career PDC quarter-final, where he lost 6‚Äì4 against Simon Whitlock. Howson played in all 16 Challenge Tour events in 2015, with his best result being a quarter-final exit in the sixth tournament. He played in 12 of them in 2016, but couldn't get past the last 64 once.

It has been jointly developed by the Research and Development Establishment (R&DE;), and IdeaForge, a Mumbai- based private firm.  Design and development  The Netra is a lightweight UAV, constructed of carbon fiber composites, that uses quadcopters to provide lift and control giving a VTOL capability. It has no moving parts other than the rotors, motors and transmissions, and hence it requires very low maintenance. The use of carbon-fibre has resulted in a light weight of , which makes the Netra very portable. A backpack case allows operators to carry the system to field locations to serve as the base station. It also contains the power supply, military-grade controller, hand-held operator console and the communication systems. = Capabilities = Netra can be launched from a small clearing, and it can fly up to a distance of 2.5 km from its take-off point. The operational altitude of the UAV is 200 m. With an on-board wireless transmitter, it can carry out surveillance in an area of 1.5 km Line of Sight (LOS) at the height of 300 m, for 30 minutes on a single battery charge. It has a high resolution CCD camera with a pan/tilt and zoom to facilitate wider surveillance and can also carry a thermal camera for night operations. The zoom-in camera can identify human activity up to 500 m away, and can send live video feed of objects within a radius of 5 km. The images are sent through a local wireless network to laptops for monitoring. Flight and navigation is independent of user-input, and is controlled by an on-board auto-pilot with the help of anti-collision sensors. The user interface offers waypoint navigation, in which the user specifies the location of the target and the UAV automatically flies to that location. A built-in fail-safe allows it to return to base if there is loss of communication with the controller or if the battery is low in power. The UAV cannot yet operate in rain and further research is being done to make it operable in all weather conditions. = Trials = 10 prototypes were made during the development stage by DRDO and they were put under tests like the temperature tests (from -10 ¬∞C to 55 ¬∞C) and high-altitude tests. After the successful trials, the UAV was cleared for production and induction. The development stage has been completed and Ideaforge is responsible for the production. The company has manufacturing capacity of 10 units per month. The base price of the UAV is ‚Çπ15-20 lakh (1.5-2 million), which can increase on purchase of additional components like a thermal camera. = Further development = Ideaforge is also working on a more advanced version of Netra, which will have an increased flight time from the present 30-minute per battery charge.  Operations  Netra has done well in the Indian market, with several central and state armed police forces procuring it, and more police units interested in its capability. With the civilian use of UAVs gaining popularity in India, ideaForge has given about 200 demonstrations to prospective buyers. The drone is designed to be used in hostage situations, border infiltration monitoring, law enforcement operations, search and rescue operations, disaster management and aerial photography. It can also be used in naxal-affected districts, in border locations across India for surveillance, and for anti-terrorist and counter- insurgency operations in dense forested areas, where it can use its camera payloads to track human activity. It can also operate in urban quarters, in situations similar to that of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. It was deployed by the local law enforcement during a political rally in Chandigarh. Gujarat Police purchased two systems at a unit price of ‚Çπ55 lakh from IdeaForge. In July 2013 during the 136th Jagannath Rath Yatra, Ahmedabad became the first Indian city to use UAVs for crowd management. Three Netra UAVs were used in Uttarakhand by the NDRF for locating people during the 2013 North India floods. It was Netra's first deployment in a disaster rescue operation. They were used in Badrinath and Kedarnath, where real-time monitoring of their video feed helped locate hundreds of survivors with precision. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police also deployed the UAV on 24 June in remote locations like Kedarnath, Bhairav Chatti and Jungle Chatti to spot survivors. = Operators = *Defence Research and Development Organisation - 10 units *Border Security Force (BSF) *Indo-Tibetan Border Police *Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) - 12 units *Mumbai Police *Maharashtra Police *Gujarat Police - 2 units *NDRF - 1 *Indian Army, Indian Navy and several other state police and central paramilitary forces have shown interest in the UAV.

Biography Pflanzer-Baltin became General of Cavalry from October 1912 and he served on the general staff, but in 1914 he was unattached, due to precarious health. It was only in the autumn of that year, when Romania appeared to be turning against the Central Powers, that he was charged with the defense of Transylvania. When the Russians crossed the Carpathians, and there was immediate danger of their eruption into the Hungarian plains, Pflanzer-Baltin, with an improvised division, threw himself on them, and conducted a defense with a series of offensive movements. He was promoted to Colonel-General in 1916. After fighting with varying success in the southern part of Eastern Galicia and in the Bukovina the 7th Army under his command was driven back by Aleksei Brusilov's offensive in June 1916, whereupon he was relieved of his command. Pflanzer-Baltin became General Inspector of the infantry in 1917 and subsequently Supreme Commander of Austro-Hungarian infantry in Albania. In the summer of 1918, the Austro-Hungarian front in Albania yielded before the attack of the Entente army.

The castle consists of a restored 15th century four storey tower house with attached outbuildings to the rear and a separate ruined 15th tower, the \\"New Tower\\". It is situated on Church Hill in the village of Crayke. History There is documentary evidence that a castle was built on the existing site soon after the Norman Conquest. The building is reportedly attributed to Bishop Hugh Pudsey. These early records do not give much detail, though the foundations of the current buildings are alleged to be from the earlier construction. The present building was constructed around 1450 for Robert Neville, Bishop of Durham on land which had belonged to the See of Durham since Saxon times. It is situated on the highest point in the Parish at an elevation of 379 feet. Up to the time of James I the castle was surrounded by a deer park. In 1647 the House of Commons decreed that the castle should not have a garrison and be dismantled. During the Civil War the castle was slighted by the Parliamentarians during the siege of York and it was then sold in 1648 to Sir William Allanson, a former Mayor and MP of York. Allanson‚Äôs son Charles repaired and restored the main building to the condition it remains in to this day. Around 1667 the manor was restored to the See of Durham to be leased out as a farmhouse to various people until Bishop William van Mildert was allowed by Parliament to sell it into private hands in 1827. The castle has been the subject of various surveys, including one by Canon Raine for a report for the Victorian Associated Architectural Societies. It was temporarily requisitioned as a Land Army barracks in the Second World War. The building was listed as Grade I in 1952. The castle was once the property of Kevin Hollinrake, Member of Parliament for the constituency of Thirsk and Malton since 2015. Layout The current layout is made of two separate and self-contained buildings. Only the southernmost building is habitable. The entire site, including grounds, covers about 6 acres. A survey in 2005 found evidence of a monastic complex that preceded the post Norman Conquest buildings that occupied the site in a traditional Motte and Bailey layout. There is also evidence for a gatehouse on the site. =Main building= The structure is made of four storeys and is rectangular measuring 70 ft 9ins by 28 ft 4ins. Each storey is defined by a band of stonework. Each storey has narrow square headed windows and at roof level is a band of crenelation. Entrance used to be via a staircase to the first storey on the north east side, but this has been removed and the modern building is now accessed at ground level on the south side. There is a vaulted under-croft to the attached building to the rear, which was a 19th-century addition as kitchens. To the rear of these kitchens are foundations to the old hall. =\\"The New Tower\\"= This building lies to the north east of the main building and was three storeys high. The current ruin is only two storeys. It was arranged in an 'L' shape with the maximum length and width around 49 feet. The ground level is built into the hill so that the upper level opens on to the summit. The height of the remaining walls is about 20 feet.

He first came to India in the 1850s and published scholarly work on the Sindhi and other western subcontinental languages. Thereafter, he was sought and sent to and the Punjab region (British India) to study and translate the Sikh scriptures by Christian missionaries aiming to understand Sikhs and thereby aid their conversion. He authored the first Sindhi grammar entitled Sindhi Alphabet and Grammar. He also published Grammar of Pashto, or language of the Afghans, compared with the Iranian and North Indian idioms. One of his notable and controversial works was based on an 8-year study of the Sikh scriptures, where he philologically analyzed and translated a significant portion of the Guru Granth Sahib into English in the 1870s.The Adi Granth, Ernest Trumpp (1877), WH Allen & Co., London; Notes: In this 876 pages publication, Trumpp's translation starts at page 156, while philological notes on the language of the Sikh scripture start at page 140 Many in the Sikh community regarded his introductory remarks to his translation as \\"extremely offensive\\". According to the Indologist Mark Juergensmeyer, setting aside Ernest Trumpp's nasty remarks, he was a German linguistic and his years of scholarship, translations, as well as field notes and discussions with Sikhs at the Golden Temple remain valuable reference works for contemporary scholars. Biography Trumpp was born on 13 March 1828 at Ilsfeld in Wurtemberg Province (now Baden-W√ºrttemberg) in Germany. He became the Regius Professor of Oriental Languages at the University of Munich and member of Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences. Around 1854 he arrived in India as a missionary sponsored by the Ecclesiastical Mission Society to study the languages of India and to prepare grammars and glossaries for use by Christian missionaries. There he was initially stationed at the Karachi mission, where he learnt the Sindhi language. Later, he was stationed at Peshawar, where he studied the Pashto language. He went back to Germany in 1860. In the 1870s, he was subsequently recommended by Robert Needham Cust and sought by the Secretary of State for India of the British government to return to India, and work on translations of Sikh scripture in Lahore (Punjab). He published a number of works related to Sindhi and Punjabi languages and texts throughout the 1870s. He died in 1885. Work While at Karachi, he translated the Common Prayer Book into the Persian language in 1858. In 1866 he edited and published Shah Jo Risalo, a poetic compendium of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. He published the first Sindhi grammar entitled Sindhi Alphabet and Grammar in 1872. He published Grammar of the Pushtoo, or language of the Afghans, compared with the Iranian and North Indian idioms in 1873, and translated most of the sacred books of the Sikh Adi Granth in 1870. After he returned to W√ºrttemberg in 1876, he dedicated most of his energies to translation. By 1876 he translated the Japji Sahib, So Purkh, Sohila, So Darh, Majh, the Ragas (Siri, Gauri and Asa), Sloks of Kabir, Shaikh Farid, and Guru Tegh Bahadur, and Savaiyyas of the Bhatts. =Sikh scriptures= Robert Needham Cust, a British colonial administrator and linguist, suggested Court of Directors of the British East India Company on 12 August 1857 that India office in London should make arrangements for translation of Adi Granth into English language. Later, Robert Needham recommended Ernest Trumpp to the British government as best qualified to translate the Sikh scripture and historic literature. In 1869, Trumpp was sought by the India office of the British government to work in Punjab to translate the Sikh scriptures into English. Trumpp enthusiastically started studying and translating them in 1870. However, after his initial effort, he stated that they were not worth translating in full, because \\"the same few ideas, he thought, being endlessly repeated\\". He found that the Sikh granthis who recited the text in the early 1870s lacked comprehension and its sense of meaning. He stated that \\"Sikhs had lost all learning\\" and the granthis were misleading. Even for Sikhs the language of the Guru Granth Sahib is considered archaic and hard to understand without an interpreter. According to Tony Ballantyne, Ernest Trumpp's insensitive approach such as treating the Sikh scripture as a mere book and blowing cigar smoke over its pages while studying the text, did not endear him to the Sikh granthis who worshipped it as an embodiment of the Guru. Trumpp, after eight years of study and research of the Sikh scriptures, published his translation and field notes. In the Introduction section, he described the Sikh scripture as \\"incoherent and shallow in the extreme, and couched at the same time in dark and perplexing language, in order to cover these defects. It is for us Occidentals a most painful and almost stupefying task, to read only a single Rag\\". Trumpp criticized Adi Granth to be lacking systematic unity, according to Arvind Pal Singh Mandair ‚Äì a Sikhism scholar.\\"Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed\\", by Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, p. 87 Trumpp said that Sikhism was \\"a reform movement in spirit\\", but \\"completely failed to achieve anything of real religious significance\\". He concluded that the most Sikhs do not understand what their scripture's verses mean and any metaphysical speculations therein. The Sikh intelligentsia he met during his years of study, stated Trumpp, only had a \\"partial understanding\\" of their own scripture. Most Sikhs neither observe the rahit-nama ‚Äì the Sikh code of conduct, nor were the popular notions of the Sikhs guided by the teachings in the Adi Granth. It was more of a military brotherhood with a martial spirit, inspired by a \\"deep fanatical hatred\\" for the Muslims given the Sikh sense of their history and identity. According to the Sikh historian Trilochan Singh, Trumpp's colonial era study and remarks were \\"extremely vulgar attacks\\" on Sikhism that did not appreciate the Sikh history, culture and religion and it reflected the arrogance of scientific-analytical method. His criticism reflected the bias of his missionary agenda, which assumed that ancient Christian scriptures were coherent, had the right answers, and that all other religions must be held in contempt. Trumpp's introduction to his translations of Adi Granth reveal that he had a contempt for the scripture and its theology, states the Sikhism scholar J. S. Grewal. According to Indologist Mark Juergensmeyer, setting aside Ernest Trumpp's nasty remarks, he was a linguist and his years of scholarship, translations, as well as field notes and discussions with Sikhs at the Golden Temple remain valuable reference works for contemporary scholars. =Other Sikh texts= In the course of his research, it seems he had discovered the first known manuscript of the Puratan Janamsakhis (also spelt Janam-sakhi), the earliest known biography of Guru Nanak, at the India office Library, London. Trumpp found these manuscripts among the manuscripts forwarded to him from the India office's Library in 1872 with a note saying \\"in hope that some of them may be useful in the project entrusted to you.\\" He translated Puratan and Bala Janamsakhis, the lives of the later [Sikh] gurus, including an account of their teachings.

She made her debut on March 19, 2011, working for Sakura's Ice Ribbon promotion, losing to Mochi Miyagi. Just two days later Narumiya wrestled at her first major Ice Ribbon event, Ice Ribbon March 2011, where she, Riho and Tamako faced Hikari Minami, Kurumi and Tsukushi in a six-woman elimination tag team match. Narumiya was eliminated from the match by Minami, after which her team was defeated, when Tsukushi pinned Riho. On April 20, Narumiya picked up her first win on April 20, defeating Miyako Matsumoto. Narumiya then teamed with Matsumoto at her second major event, Golden Ribbon 2011 on May 5, where the two defeated Hamuko Hoshi and Mochi Miyagi, with Narumiya pinning Hoshi for the win. Narumiya's following months consisted mainly of losses, with her picking up her only wins against fellow newcomer Dorami Nagano. During June, Narumiya formed the N3 stable with Meari Naito and Neko Nitta, who debuted around the same time as her.

Prior to the match, Narumiya entered a storyline, where she was coaxed into giving up the guillotine leg drop finisher by the defending champion, Tsukasa Fujimoto, who claimed she could not defeat her without the move. Narumiya had earlier claimed that the move had caused her spinal cord injury a year earlier. On December 31, Narumiya failed in her title challenge against Fujimoto.

On February 3, the 310th day of their reign, Narumiya and Sera became the longest-reigning champions in the history of the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. Their reign of 356 days ended on March 21, when they were defeated by Shishunki (Mio Shirai and Tsukushi) in their tenth title defense.

The app has also been removed from the U.K. iOS App Store but is still available on the U.S., Canadian and Australian App Stores. Gameplay 275x275px In Pocket Planes, players assume the role of an airline CEO. Starting with a few airports and small planes, players transport small amounts of cargo and passengers short distances. As they slowly gain profit from their flights, they then build more airports, buy better planes, and expand their airline internationally. A formula determines how much profit will be earned from a flight, depending on the distance, speed and the weight of the plane used on the route. Filling a plane with items or people going to the same destination will net a 25% bonus on each item. Players can also complete events that involve flying special items and people to a designated destination. After completing these events, players are awarded Bux, which are used to buy planes and purchase other perks such as upgrades and the ability to speed up flights. Shutdown for Android On 24 September 2015, the company that ported the game to Android, Mobage, shut down their game servers for Pocket Planes and other NimbleBit games including Pocket Frogs and Tiny Tower, and subsequently removed these downloads from the Google Play Store.

The main building was sited on the eastbound platform, with the goods shed at the west end of that platform. The original signal box was placed just opposite this platform, but a second signal box was opened in 1942 to control and monitor some new loop lines and sidings which created to the west of the station itself.

It was awarded by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) to living soldiers who had performed with exceptional valor in battle. Airmen, especially fighter pilots defending Japan against enemy bombers, were most likely to win the award. Eighty-nine Buk≈çsh≈ç were awarded during the eight months it was actively awarded. Background The Order of the Golden Kite had served for decades as an auspicious military award of the Japanese armed forces, and was the only Japanese order that was solely awarded to the military (the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Sacred Treasure could also be awarded to civilians). However, the process by which Order of the Golden Kite was awarded was very lengthy: it was indeed awarded to military men who had died in service, while the remainder were normally awarded only after the end of a war, for services throughout the conflict. As the Second World War dragged on, it became apparent that there was a need to promote morale among active army units by rewarding acts of valor more readily. To this end, the IJA suggested the Buk≈çch≈çsh≈ç as an alternate decoration for living recipients who had shown the highest valor in combat, to be awarded much more quickly by division commanders in the field. Emperor Hirohito established the award on 7 December 1944, the third anniversary of the attacks on Hong Kong and Pearl Harbor, which had signaled the start of the broader Pacific War. Award The Buk≈çsh≈ç (as it was popularly known) was presented in two classes, called A and B, or First and Second. Loosely resembling the Iron Cross 1st Class, the Buk≈çsh≈ç was a pin back badge, cast in iron or steel, featuring two shields (in gilt for A-Class, bronzed for B-Class) forming a cross, with a gilt banner at the center bearing the two kanji characters \\"Buk≈ç\\" (Military Merit). The reverse side (again in gilt for A-Class, bronzed for B-Class) bore the six kanji characters in two columns \\"Rikugun/Buk≈çch≈çsh≈ç\\" (Army/Badge for Military Merit). Both classes were the same size: high and wide. The Buk≈çsh≈ç was allowed to be given retroactively to soldiers who had distinguished themselves as far back as 1941 or perhaps 1940. In practice, the award was given disproportionately to fighter pilots flying against the American Boeing B-29 Superfortresses bombing the Japanese homeland. The first three men to win the award were Toru Shinomiya, Masao Itagaki and Matsumi Nakano‚Äîpilots flying the Kawasaki Ki-61 Hien fighter known by the Allies as the \\"Tony\\". On 3 December 1944, the three men were successful in very risky aerial ramming attacks. Another pilot, Masao Itagaki, successfully rammed B-29s on two occasions to earn two Buk≈çsh≈ç. Unusually, the IJA awarded the Buk≈çsh≈ç to at least one aviator of the Imperial Japanese Navy, for valiant action in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19‚Äì20 June 1944.

It is one of the best-known and most widely cited examples of the genre in Spanish.  The story  Origin The type of micronarrative or microfiction of which \\"El emigrante\\" is a famous example has precursors in the 1980s and 1990s with the work of Jacques Sternberg and Philippe Delerm, but perhaps has been brought back to life through the influence of Facebook and Twitter. However, one should not consider micronarrative exclusively as a (post)modern form of literature. Micronarrative is better understood as one of many (re)configurations in the fragmentary writing continuum. In fact, microtexts are as old as literature itself. Old manifestations of brevity in writing include, to name but a few examples, Sumerian and Egyptian instructions and Greek epigrams and aphorisms. The author explains that the story came from the little sign he kept seeing when leaving buses or airplanes, saying ¬øOlvida usted algo? (Did you forget anything?). That made him think of all the things he would like to remember but could not, and the other things he would prefer to forget. Thinking of these things became a private game for him, whenever he saw the sign. He was given a grant by the Mexican Foundation for Literature that included obligatory attendance at a workshop on micro-stories and, without thinking much, wrote the story down. He added ¬°Ojal√°! (If only!) to the text of the sign to create the story. Later, when taking his book of short stories to the publisher, it struck him that the micro-story summarized all the others, so he added it at the beginning. He had no idea it would become so widely known. In fact, it had already been submitted to a magazine and rejected. Publication and reception \\"El emigrante\\" appeared in Lomel√≠'s second book, Ella sigue de viaje, published in March 2005. The story may be seen as a summary of the feelings of the characters in the other stories in the book, whether they have left behind love, loneliness or violence. Another story in this book won the Edmundo Valad√©s Latin American Short Story Prize. The book itself won the prestigious San Luis Potos√≠ national short story award. \\"El emigrante\\", and others in the microfiction genre such as the classic work by Guatemalan writer Augusto Monterroso, \\"El dinosaurio\\", present questions that provoke thought and intellectual development. \\"El emigrante\\" has become one of the most celebrated and frequently cited of microfiction stories. It is wrongly considered as the shortest story in the Spanish language. A much shorter story, included in La mitad del diablo (2006) is Juan Pedro Aparicio's \\"Luis XIV\\", whose whole text includes a single word: \\"Yo\\". Nonetheless, \\"El emigrante\\" has brought widespread recognition to the author, who has since moved on to writing a full-length novel, at the opposite end of the extreme. The story inspired ¬øOlvida usted algo? ‚Äì ¬°Ojal√°!, an installation by the artist Susana Rodr√≠guez, which opened in August 2009 at the Casa del Lago in Mexico City. Rodr√≠guez's work explores the idea of a building that perhaps has been destroyed during a storm, but where traces remain of the time when it was inhabited. The outdoor installation is constructed of bricks, concrete, ceramic tiles and a wooden door. The work is ambiguous, leaving it to the viewer to interpret whether the building was destroyed, is in the process of being built, or is complete. The artist has said she addresses the dialectic between construction and destruction as an event that helps us understand and accept the transformation of life as inevitable.

Directed by John Lavin, the film follows the cross-country journey of identical twins Gary and Larry Lane to deliver to Dolly Parton a screenplay they wrote, which includes a role for her. Hollywood to Dollywood has won 24 film festival awards and includes 17 Parton songs, two of which were previously unreleased. The film had a one-week theatrical release in New York beginning August 31, 2012, followed a week later in Los Angeles. Synopsis Twin brothers Gary and Larry Lane, originally from Goldsboro, N.C., have written a screenplay entitled Full Circle with a role specifically for their idol, Dolly Parton. Unsuccessful in their efforts to bring the screenplay to the singer-actress's attention, the brothers travel in an RV from Los Angeles, where they reside, to Dollywood, Parton's theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Their plan is to hand the screenplay to Parton, whom they had met a few times briefly, at one of her scheduled appearances during Dollywood's 25th anniversary celebration. Hollywood to Dollywood follows the brothers' travels in the RV they nicknamed Jolene, after one of Parton's hit songs. Also on board Jolene as the main driver is Michael Bowen, Gary Lane's partner. Bowen hopes to present Parton with a birdhouse he handcrafted, a replica of her Tennessee home. During the five-day journey of 2,200 miles along Interstate 40, the Lanes revise their screenplay, endure a tornado, meet everyday Americans, and talk about their experiences growing up gay in North Carolina. The 2010 Nashville flood nearly derails their plans to get to Dollywood in time to meet Parton. The documentary also explores the Lane twins' concerns about their Southern hometown's potential reaction to the film (and to the brothers' homosexuality) and their desire for acceptance from their Southern Baptist mother. Hollywood to Dollywood includes appearances from several of the Lane twins' friends, including actors Leslie Jordan, Chad Allen, Beth Grant and Ann Walker and Oscar-winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black. Cast *Gary Lane as himself *Larry Lane as himself *Michael Bowen as himself *Dolly Parton as herself *Leslie Jordan as himself *Chad Allen as himself *Dustin Lance Black as himself *Beth Grant as herself *Ann Walker as herself *Manouschka Guerrier as herself Parton's involvement After viewing the film, Parton granted the Lane twins the use of some of her songs for the film as well as the DVD and Blu-ray versions. Parton's music, including hits such as I Will Always Love You, Coat of Many Colors, and Jolene and two previously unreleased songs Celebrate the Dreamer in You and The Sky is Not the Limit, serve as a backdrop throughout the film. The brothers helped pay for the rights to Parton's music with prize money earned on the reality TV program Wipeout. Parton also gave permission to use her likeness in the film's poster and in the film's promotion. She gave the filmmakers footage shot at Dollywood and during the opening of her Trinkets and Treasures store in Nashville. Parton appears in the film as well, in news clips and in footage shot for the documentary. During a press conference Parton said she appreciated that she was \\"an inspiration (to the Lanes) and someone they kind of leaned on.\\" She said she was \\"proud\\" to be a part of their documentary. The Lane twins donate 10 percent of each DVD and Blu-ray sale to the Imagination Library, an organization administered by Parton's Dollywood Foundation. The Imagination Library provides free books each month to young children enrolled in the program. Accolades The Lanes submitted their film to festivals whose timing would coincide with Parton's tour dates. During 2011 and 2012, Hollywood to Dollywood played at 60 film festivals in the U.S., Canada, Scotland, and Australia. The New York Times review of the film said, \\"The optimism and good humor of John Lavin's crude, endearing documentary...are so unquenchable that its disturbing underlying theme ‚Äî growing up gay in the South is no picnic ‚Äî is partly obscured by its openheartedness.\\" The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Hollywood to Dollywood overcomes its thematic limitations with an endearing, casual charm that only the most curmudgeonly could fully resist.\\" The Village Voice said the film is \\"as much a road movie as it is a subtle screed on civil rights.\\" On her TV program, Rosie O'Donnell called Hollywood to Dollywood \\"a beautiful movie.\\" In a review on the website AfterElton.com, Brent Hartinger wrote that \\"the movie's terrific ‚Äî a true crowd-pleaser all the way.\\" Hartinger added that \\"easily the most interesting thing about the movie is its look at American Southern culture, particularly as it applies to gays.\\" The blog DVDTalk said the film is \\"thoroughly enjoyable,\\" \\"a hybrid of carefree road trip and probing examination of the Southern American LGBT community.\\" Hollywood to Dollywood has won 24 film festivals awards including Best Documentary, Audience Favorite at the Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival (2012); Best Documentary, NYC Downtown Feature Film Festival (2012); Audience Choice Award, Best Documentary, Out on Film Festival, Atlanta (2012); and two awards at the 8th Annual ReelHeART International Film Festival in Toronto (2011), including the prestigious 'Founder's Award (Best of the Fest) and First Place, Feature Documentary Award.

Goldsmith, first published in 1968 in New York Magazine, about a destroyed one-named actress, Viva, who is drugged out and couldn't pay her phone bill. Barbara Goldsmith is an American author, journalist, and philanthropist. Her La Dolce Viva made known the sadder side of Andy Warhol‚Äôs entourage through Viva, a high on drugs ‚Äúsuperstar.‚Äù Summary La Dolce Viva is an interview story with \\"superstar\\" Viva, who is one of the many actresses in Andy Warhol's movies. Viva was headlined as 'The Last of Andy Warhol's \\"superstars\\", as Warhol would film them and declare them \\"superstars\\". Along with being an actress, Viva is a model who influences the fashion trends of the time. Viva's modeling and acting career was launched with the help of Warhol and his many friends. Being in Warhol's inner circle made Viva a good choice for this interview. Viva grew up in a very Catholic home surrounded by figures of the Virgin Mary, Bibles, and pictures of First Communion. At home, religious values were imposed upon Viva from her family. Viva lived with the nuns until she was twenty years old. Once Viva turned twenty, she left the religious ways of her family and the Catholic Church and she started to explore what is now her derogatory lifestyle of sleeping around with multiple partners. The book details Viva's experience with sex, drug, and love in Warhol's factory. Along with sleeping with a different guy almost every night, Viva also was turned on to drugs by Timothy Leary. Viva started doing drugs out of curiosity but quickly became addicted and could not stop. The environment of Andy Warhol and his inner circle did not help her addiction to these drugs due to the fact that everyone else was using them as well. Once Viva became tired of drugs and sex, she decided to return home to her parents and asked to be put into a mental institution. Once viva say the institution, she became scared and begged her mother to take her home. When Viva returned home, she realized that she missed the lifestyle that she had with Warhol and decided to go back to New York with her sister. Viva started out back in New York with her sister but that quickly ended when she realized her dependency upon Warhol and she decided to leave her sister and move back into Warhol's inner circle. Her promiscuous ways and drug use led Viva to become very dependent upon men. Even though in the interview Viva tries to portray herself as an independent woman, she greatly depends on Andy Warhol to not only help pay her rent and electricity bill but to help her keep up with her lifestyle of drug use and fitting in with the crowd. Having to have Andy Warhol pay for everything Viva needed clearly shows just how dependent she was on someone else. =Tone= In La Dolce Viva the tone is honest, shocking to some, and nonchalant. Her lifestyle, especially her promiscuity, was not accepted in this period in time. Throughout Goldsmith's representation of tone and mood, it is somewhat negative as they scrimmage through her apartment junk, talk about her rough life, and the need for sex and drugs. =Setting= La Dolce Viva takes place mostly in Warhol's new loft studio which has been named 'The Factory', which was full of his helpers and hangers-on. Some parts of the interview took place in Viva's East 83rd Street brownstone floor-through apartment which is scattered with the mixture of clean and dirty clothes, underwear, dishes in the sink, food on the counter and stacks of old magazines and papers. Along with Andy Warhol's apartment and Viva's apartment, La Dolce Viva also takes place in Max's Kansas City, a restaurant where the models, actresses, and Warhol were treated like celebrities. =Characterization= Viva's character is introduced to readers as an actress in Andy Warhol's movies and later, readers find out that she is a model who influences the fashion industry. Goldsmith uses questions that lead to showing Viva's promiscuous side and her dependency on a male figure. Viva is quoted saying \\"I slept with him for security reasons\\" during the interview and Goldsmith included this quote because it showed Viva's constant need for a man. Her disorganization and unreliability contributed to the end of her modeling aspirations. Describing Viva's messy apartment and how the dust filled your nose as you walked in and you could hardly see through the filthy windows, helps readers see how Viva lived a cluttered and messy lifestyle. The way that Viva presented herself during the interview with an outfit that did not match and hair that looked unwashed for days showed just how little she cared about her appearance. Effects and Criticism La Dolce Viva revealed the seedier side of Andy Warhol's entourage through Viva. ‚ÄúI had never seen anything like it,‚Äù Tom Wolfe wrote of accompanying nude photos from Diane Arbus. According to contemporary New York Times review of the book, La Dolce Viva gave an insight to Warhol's relationship to other people. But the articles appearance in the New York hurt the magazine (\\"The Nude Photos that Nearly Destroyed New York\\"), and New Yorks editor, Clay Felker, was aware of the commercial risk he ran in publishing the piece. Some reviewers of La Dolce Viva were generally hesitant to read this piece, but then read the entire work.

Sneed sought revenge for the sake of his honor and his home, which resulted in the deaths of seven men within the year. Background The Sneeds were a wealthy family of cattle ranchers who lived in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. By 1911, the Sneeds had been married for over ten years and had two daughters. In October 1911, after his wife informed him that she had been involved in a relationship with Boyce and wanted a divorce, Sneed had her placed in an asylum. (A diagnosis of \\"moral insanity\\" was a common practice for adulterous women at the time.) However, in the month following her incarceration, Boyce \\"rescued\\" her, and the two fled to Winnipeg, Canada. Sneed's response to his wife's \\"kidnapping\\" by Boyce triggered a \\"bizarre series of events that symbolized the tenacity of frontier justice in west Texas in the early twentieth century.\\" Initially, Sneed informed the police and succeeded in having Boyce and Mrs. Sneed arrested. She was released into the custody of her father, Tom Snyder, who owned a ranch in New Mexico Territory, but she later returned to Fort Worth to be with her husband. Sneed hoped to see Boyce sent to prison on charges of kidnapping. However, after the charges were dropped, he decided to take the law into his own hands. The feud The first death in the conflict occurred on January 13, 1912, when John B. Sneed killed Albert Boyce, Sr., who was a banker and a former manager of the XIT Ranch. Boyce was unarmed, and Sneed shot him in the back while they were standing inside the lobby of Fort Worth's Metropolitan Hotel. During the ensuing trial, Sneed alleged that Boyce, Sr. had assisted his son in \\"breaking up [his] home.\\" The trial was sensationalized by newspapers as \\"the greatest legal battle ever fought in Texas Courts.\\" Sneed's well-paid legal team managed to secure a mistrial. After the mistrial was announced, an angry mob attacked the courthouse, but was repulsed. An article written by Thomas H. Thompson for The New Handbook of Texas states: \\"Four men were killed outside the courthouse, and women fought with hatpins in the courthouse halls and even in the courtroom.\\" ;More violence On March 6, 1912, Sneed's father, Joseph, was shot in the back and killed by a tenant farmer, R. O. Hillard, as he was walking down a street in Georgetown, Texas. According to Bartee Haile, a Texas historian, immediately after shooting the elder Sneed, Hillard committed suicide. In his pocket was found a letter that said; \\"My mind has failed me. J.T. Sneed is the cause of it. I am going to take revenge this way and then go to the asylum.\\" Sneed thought the Boyce family had something to do with his father's death. When Boyce, Jr. returned to Amarillo, Texas later that year, Sneed was waiting in disguise. On September 14, 1912, Sneed attacked Boyce in front of the Polk Street Methodist Church, shooting him three times with a shotgun. Boyce was killed before he could defend himself. Sneed then walked to the courthouse and surrendered to the Potter County sheriff. One of the witnesses who watched as Sneed surrendered was the young school teacher Georgia O'Keeffe. On the day after Boyce's death, friends and relatives of both factions began assembling in Amarillo. It seemed as though more bloodshed would ensue, but the would-be combatants dispersed after Sneed posted bail. ;Trials Sneed was retried for killing Boyce, Sr. before also being tried for killing the latter's son. He was acquitted both times, with the juries declaring the shootings justifiable homicides. Sneed became somewhat of a folk hero among Texans, but newspaper reporters from outside of the state regarded the shootings as cold-blooded murder. When reporters demanded a reason for the acquittal in the murder of Al Boyce, Jr., the jury foreman, James D. Crane, responded by saying; \\"The best answer is because this is Texas. We believe [that] in Texas a man has the right and the obligation to safeguard the honor of his home, even if he must kill the person responsible.\\" Aftermath After the trials, the Sneeds moved to Paducah, Texas, where they owned a ranch and a cotton farm. Mr. Sneed was also involved in land speculation. In October 1922, he was found guilty in a federal court of having bribed a juror who had been involved in one of his land deals. Sneed was sentenced to two years at Leavenworth, Kansas, by Judge James C. Wilson. While in prison, Sneed's son-in-law, Wood Barton, was killed by a grocer, C. B. Berry, over a $28 debt. Although arrested, Berry was eventually acquitted. After Sneed was released from prison, he sought revenge for his daughter. During two separate encounters in the streets of Paducah, separated by several months, Sneed and Berry shot each other numerous times. None of the wounds were fatal, though. In early 1924, in yet another instance of frontier justice, both men were acquitted of having shot the other. The Sneeds left Paducah and moved to Dallas, where they invested in an oilfield ‚Äì they remained in Dallas for the next thirty years. Sneed died of cancer on April 22, 1960; Lena died six years later, on March 6, 1966. They are interred side by side at Hillcrest Cemetery in Dallas.

Unhappy about being subjected to his investigation, the prominent citizens of the town launch a campaign to discredit him, employing a couple of devils. One of them is instructed to enter the magistrate's body \\"through the most suitable orifice, the anus,\\" transforming him into a rogue, a debauchee, a hypocrite and a black marketeer. Due to a misunderstanding, the devil Barlocca enters the body of Pizzocca Gann√†ssa, Alfonso's elderly and ungainly housekeeper, who is transformed into a delectable, busty lady (the 'boobs' of the title). Led astray by this beauty, the magistrate is dragged into court, but the she-devil allows him to be acquitted. Nonetheless he is condemned to become a galley slave in a subsequent trial.'

Tacitus offers a hostile portrait of Capito in his Annales, describing him as a \\"man stained with much wickedness\\",Tacitus, Annales, XI.6 and as having \\"a heart eager for the worst wickedness\\".Tacitus, Annales, XVI.21 Career Tacitus first mentions Capito following the trial and suicide of Valerius Asiaticus in AD 47, when he and Publius Suillius Rufus were subsequently threatened with the Lex Cincia for accepting payments in return for serving as a legal advocate. However, both men managed to extract leniency from emperor Claudius, and he amended the law to permit a fee to be paid to an advocate of up to ten thousand sesterces.Tacitus, Annales, XI.6-7 After this incident he became the governor of Cilicia; the year of his tenure is not known. But he had returned to Rome by the year 57, for in that year the subjects of Cilicia, represented by the senator Thrasea Paetus, accused him of extortion. Captio lost this lawsuit; his penalties included being stripped of his senatorial rank.Tacitus, Annales, XIII.33.3; XVI.21 Capito had regained his senatorial rank by the year 62, when he reappears in Tacitus' work, with the help of his father-in-law the praetorian prefect Ofonius Tigellinus.Tacitus, Annales, XIV.48 In that year he accused the praetor Antistius Sosianus of an act of treason, specifically writing and reciting scurrilous verses about the emperor Nero at a banquet hosted by Marcus Ostorius Scapula. Tacitus notes that this was the first occasion that anyone had been prosecuted for treason under Nero. Although Scapula claimed to have not heard the verses in question, a number of witnesses testified Sosianus had done so. Quintus Junius Marullus, the consul- elect, proposed that Sosianus should be deprived of his praetorship and executed; but once again Thrasea Paetus intervened against Capito, and convinced the Senate to pass a milder verdict of banishment to a desolate island.Tacitus, Annales, XIV.48-49 These successes of Thrasea Paetus earned him the displeasure of both the emperor and Capito. Four years later, he assisted Titus Clodius Eprius Marcellus in the prosecution Thrasea Paetus; Nero coerced the Senate to find him guilty, which led to Thrasea Paetus' suicide.Tacitus, Annales, XVI.21-35 His life afterwards is a blank. It is uncertain whether Capito survived the turmoil of the Year of Four Emperors.

It specialized in publishing high-quality book prints and illustrated albums. History The Altenberg Publishing was founded by Herman Altenberg, born in 1848. Altenberg, together with Maurice Robitschki led the Warsaw bookstore with small painting gallery in the years 1872‚Äì1879. They were the first in Poland to sell color reproductions of paintings. Altenberg moved to Lw√≥w (now Lviv) in 1880, where he purchased the bookstore with a book rental. The same year, he commissioned painter Micha≈Ç Elwiro Andriolli to produce a series of illustrations for his edition of Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz.Originally, some illustrations to the popular Pan Tadeusz were produced by painter Juliusz Kossak, but they were lost, before they could be published. The epic poem by Mickiewicz was originally published by Altenberg in monthly brochures and then published in full in 1882 (second edition in a smaller format was adopted in 1921). He had designed the book as a refined album with vignettes and 24 full-page illustrations, including ornamental initials and interludes ‚Äì which brought the number of illustrations to a total of 58 drawings. Illustration to Pan Tadeusz commissioned by Altenberg Publishing in 1882 from Micha≈Ç Elwiro Andriolli Although exclusively released as Altenberg's limited edition, prints by Andriolli have not been well received by the critics due to preconceived notions about the poem itself. Herman Altenberg besides other classics of Polish literature published also the Fables (Bajeczki) by J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski with illustrations by Andriolli, as well as Mohorta by Wincenty Pol with illustrations by Juliusz Kossak. Altenberg was the initiator of a new series called the Polish Classics Library (1882‚Äì1909) in which Jan Kochanowski and Stanis≈Çaw Trembecki were published, and, the Amateur Theatres Library series. He first introduced in Galicia the system of selling books through agents. After Herman Altenberg's death in 1885 the company was successfully run by his wife, Zuzanna (Susan) n√©e Eber (1851‚Äì1921) together with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Ba≈Çz. They had published such classics as the Songs of the Legions by J√≥zef Wybicki (author of Poland's national anthem) with illustrations by Kossak as well as Ballady i romanse (Ballads and Romances) collection of widely popular poems by Mickiewicz edited by Ludwik Finkel with illustrations by Andriolli. In 1894, they released the actual illustrated catalog of the books published by Altenberg Publishing for the purpose of sales and promotion. In 1896, the Altenberg Publishing issued a poetic drama Dziady by Mickiewicz, considered one of the great works of European Romanticism. It was the first deluxe edition of Dziady (Forefathers' Eve) illustrated with engravings by Czes≈Çaw Borys Jankowski, and edited by Wilhelm Bruchnalski.Ewa B. T≈Çuczek, Renata M. ZajƒÖc, Lwowskie ksiƒÖ≈ºki i czasopisma. Bibliofilstwo i kolekcjonerstwo. \\"Konspekt\\", Krak√≥w. Retrieved September 9, 2012. Within a few years, the Altenberg Publishing run by Zuzanna, received a license to operate bookstores in several different cities including Krynica, Brody, Drohobycz, Jaros≈Çaw, Rawa Ruska, and Sambor. Zuzanna Altenberg led the company until 1897, when her son Alfred took over the family business. Family ownership In 1897 the company was taken over by Alfred Altenberg (born in 1877), the son of Herman Altenberg. Aside from the fine art reproductions, it published books on art and literature including K. Ch≈Çƒôdowski, P. Chmielowski, and W. Feldman. As part of a new series of great writers, Alfred Altenberg published also the collections of works by Jan Kasprowicz, Maria Konopnicka, Juliusz S≈Çowacki and more poetry by Mickiewicz. The new series included the Historical Library, the Library of Drama, and the popular-science Wiedza i ≈ªycie. The periodicals included Lamus and satirical Szczutka weekly. Many publications were fitted with high quality hard covers, best paper, carefully selected fonts, formats and illustrations. In 1907 the company was inherited by Alfred's brother, Maurycy Altenberg who was unable to maintain it. It was saved from bankruptcy in 1912 by the eminent Polish historian and geographer Jan Pawlikowski helped by his own father and a group of concerned publishers, who set it up as a joint venture. In the years 1911‚Äì1913 the company was transformed into the H. Altenberg, Seyfarth G, E, Wende & Co. It went on to publish the Ksiƒôga ubogich (Book of the Impoverished) by Jan Kasprowicz and the Polish Portraits of the 16th to the 19th centuries (Portrety polskie) by Maryia Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, edited by Jerzy Mycielski. The company also published the Grze≈õ magazine for children. In 1920 the publishing house sold its bookstore. Soon later, it published (for the first time in full) the epic poem Kr√≥l Duch (The Spirit King) by Juliusz S≈Çowacki among other things. After Alfred's death in 1924, the company was run by his wife Jadwiga for the next decade. In 1934 the Altenberg Publishing was liquidated.

Erected in 1907, it was dedicated to the officers, non-commissioned officers and enlisted men of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers who fought and died in the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902). Construction Funded by public subscription, the arch was designed by John Howard Pentland and built by Henry Laverty and Sons. Thomas Drew consulted on the design and construction. The proportions of the structure are said to be modelled on the Arch of Titus in Rome. It is approximately wide and high.A plaque alongside the arch reads: \\"The Arch was constructed of Irish granite with the inscriptions carried out in limestone by Laverty & Sons from Belfast. The Arch stands 32 feet 6 inches in height and 27 feet and 3 inches in width\\" The internal dimensions of the arch are 5.6 m high and approximately 3.7 m wide (18 by 12 ft). The main structure of the arch is granite, with the inscriptions carried out in limestone and a bronze adornment on the front of the arch. Dedication and reception The arch was commissioned to commemorate the four battalions (two regular and two militia) of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers that served in the Second Boer war. It lists the principal battles and locations at which the fusiliers fought: Hart's Hill, Ladysmith, Talana, Colenso, Tugela Heights, and Laing's Nek. The names of 222 dead are inscribed on the underside of the arch. The construction of the arch coincided with a time of political and social change in Ireland, and the colonial and imperial background to the dedication were anathema to a burgeoning nationalist movement ‚Äì who labelled the structure \\"Traitor's Gate\\". Though damaged in a cross-fire between the Irish Citizens Army and British troops during the 1916 Easter Rising, the arch remains \\"one of the few colonialist monuments in Dublin not blown up\\" in Ireland's post-independence history.

It works by using a TFO cookie (a TCP option), which is a cryptographic cookie stored on the client and set upon the initial connection with the server. When the client later reconnects, it sends the initial SYN packet along with the TFO cookie data to authenticate itself. If successful, the server may start sending data to the client even before the reception of the final ACK packet of the three-way handshake, thus skipping a round-trip delay and lowering the latency in the start of data transmission. The cookie is generated by applying a block cipher keyed on a key held secret by the server to the client's IP address, generating an authentication tag that is difficult for third parties to spoof, even if they can forge a source IP address or make two-way connections to the same server from other IP addresses. Although it uses cryptographic techniques to generate the cookie, TFO is not intended to provide more security than the three-way handshake it replaces, and does not give any form of cryptographic protection to the resulting TCP connection, or provide identity assurance about either endpoint. It also is not intended to be resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks. If such resistance is required, it may be used in combination with a cryptographic protocol such as TLS or IPsec.  History  The TFO proposal was originally presented in 2011 and was published as the experimental RFC 7413 in December 2014. TCP Fast Open shares the goal of bypassing the three-way handshake of TCP with an earlier proposal from 1994, called T/TCP (RFC 1644). In contrast to TCP Fast Open, T/TCP paid no attention to security, opening a path for vulnerabilities and failing to gain traction.  Characteristics  TFO implementations include the following: * IPv4 support for TFO was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel versions 3.6 (support for clients) and 3.7 (Dec 2012) (support for servers), and was turned on by default in kernel version 3.13 (Jan 2014). TFO support for IPv6 servers was merged in kernel version 3.16. * FreeBSD from version 10.3 (support for servers) and 12.0 (support for clients). * Mozilla Firefox from version 58. * Google Chrome and Chromium browsers have support for TFO on Linux, including Chrome OS and Android. * Exim mail transfer agent (MTA) from version 4.88. * Unbound DNS Resolver from version 1.5.10 * BIND Domain Name System (DNS) from version 9.11.0. * Knot DNS from version 2.6.0 * Apple's iOS 9 and OS X 10.11 both support TCP Fast Open, but it is not enabled for individual connections by default. * Microsoft Edge supports TCP Fast Open since Windows 10 Preview build 14352. * PowerDNS Recursor supports TCP Fast Open from version 4.1. * dnsmasq will support TCP-fastopen (RFC-7413) in the upcoming version 2.81.

He was considered \\"one of America's premier internists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\\". Biography Edward Janeway was born near New Brunswick, New Jersey, August 31, 1841. He graduated from Rutgers College in 1860, receiving the degree of B.A. and M.A. from that institution. In 1864 he was graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, receiving the degree of M.D. While in the medical school in the years 1862 and 1863, he was made acting medical cadet in the United States Army hospitals at Newark, New Jersey. After graduation he worked at the Blackwell Island Smallpox Hospital before starting at Bellevue Hospital. In 1872, he became professor of pathology and practical anatomy in Bellevue Hospital Medical College. From 1868 to 1871 he was visiting physician to Charity Hospital. He later became visiting and consulting physician to other hospitals in the city, including Mount Sinai, St. Luke's, and the French Hospital. In 1874 he was vice-president of the New York Pathological Society. From 1875 till 1882, he was Health Commissioner of New York. In 1876 he was president of the New York Medical Journal Association; his principal contributions to medical literature appear in the medical journals of New York. He was one of the founders of the Association of American Physicians in 1886. Also in 1886, he assumed the post of Chair of Internal Medicine at the Bellevue Hospital Medical College; he continued in that role until 1892. When the College merged with the New York University School of Medicine in 1898, he became its clinical director. He was president of the Academy of Medicine in 1897 and 1898 and a trustee from 1899 until 1903. Later in life, the degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him, by Rutgers in 1898, by Columbia in 1904, and by Princeton in 1907. He died in Summit, New Jersey, on February 10, 1911. He is most famously known for describing non-tender lesions on the palms or soles of individuals with endocarditis; these physical exam findings were later called Janeway lesions in his honor. His son, Theodore Caldwell Janeway was the first full-time professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. His grandson Charles Alderson Janeway was an eminent American pediatrician, medical professor, and clinical researcher. Another grandson, Edward G. Janeway, was President of the Vermont Senate.

John Harrison Clark or Changa-Changa (c. 1860‚Äì1927) effectively ruled much of what is today southern Zambia from the early 1890s to 1902. He arrived alone from South Africa in about 1887, reputedly as an outlaw, and assembled and trained a private army of Senga natives that he used to drive off various bands of slave-raiders. He took control of a swathe of territory on the north bank of the Zambezi river called Mashukulumbwe, became known as Chief \\"Changa-Changa\\" and, through a series of treaties with local chiefs, gained mineral and labour concessions covering much of the region. Starting in 1897, Clark attempted to secure protection for his holdings from the British South Africa Company. The Company took little notice of him. A local chief, Chintanda, complained to the Company in 1899 that Clark had secured his concessions while passing himself off as a Company official and had been collecting hut tax for at least two years under this pretence. The Company resolved to remove him from power, and did so in 1902. Clark then farmed for about two decades, with some success, and moved in the late 1910s to Broken Hill. There he became a prominent local figure, and a partner in the first licensed brewery in Northern Rhodesia. Remaining in Broken Hill for the rest of his life, he died there in 1927. Early life The alt=A red flag with the British Union Jack in the canton. Not much is known about John Harrison Clark's early life. The son of a man \\"in the hardware business\\" (according to a military officer who knew him, Major G R Deare), he was born in Port Elizabeth, Cape Colony around 1860, and engaged for a time in the Cape Mounted Riflemen during the 1880s. A tall, physically strong man, he wore a large black moustache and was regarded as a fine shot and a capable hunter. Harrison Clark left South Africa in 1887, but it is unclear why; according to a story that may be apocryphal, he fled the country as an outlaw soon after his revolver fired‚Äîby accident, so the story goes‚Äîand killed a man. Whatever the truth, he travelled to Mozambique, then a Portuguese territory, where he made his way upriver along the Zambezi until he reached Feira, a long-abandoned Portuguese settlement at the confluence of the Zambezi and Luangwa Rivers, in what is today southern Zambia. Feira was founded by missionaries from Portugal in about 1720, but by 1887 it was a ghost town. Its last inhabitants had fled amid a native rising about half a century before, and since then it had been deserted. David Livingstone, who visited Feira in 1856, described it as utterly ruined at that time, but still conspicuous by the ramshackle monastery buildings on the site. When Clark arrived about three decades later, the Portuguese still maintained a boma (fort) called Zumbo on the opposite bank of the Luangwa, but the surrounding country, then called Mashukulumbwe, was largely wild, and out of the control of any government. Harrison Clark settled at Feira, initially alone. According to a letter he wrote in 1897, he flew the British Merchant Navy's Red Ensign flag over his house.Letter from Clark to Earl Grey (October 1897), included in Rise to power Slave-raiding was rife in Mashukulumbwe, with gangs of Arab, Portuguese and mixed Chikunda-Portuguese ethnicity competing for the capture of local Baila and Batonga people for use as slaves. Clark, who became known to the locals as \\"Changa-Changa\\", raised and trained an \\"army\\" from among the Senga people, and issued these men a vague uniform. How he became a chief is equivocal‚ÄîDeare asserted that Clark arrived in Mashukulumbwe \\"on the very day the chief died ... [and] was finally made chief of the tribe\\". According to a story told by an acquaintance, Harry Rangeley, and partly corroborated by Alexander Scott in the Central African Post in 1949, he became chief by virtue of winning a battle. Rangeley's version has him defeating a rival chief; Scott has Clark coming to the rescue of a Baila village under attack by Portuguese slavers, \\"liberat[ing] the slaves\\" and thereupon being proclaimed chief by the grateful villagers. As chief, Clark secured his authority with his army of Senga warriors, defined and collected \\"taxes\\" and oversaw the activities of foreign traders in the area. Locals paid tribute in the form of cattle, and overseas merchants had to obtain a \\"trading licence\\" from Harrison Clark before they could operate in his territory. Where a trader was harvesting ivory to sell overseas, Clark levied every other tusk as an \\"export tax\\". As well as regulating local trade, Clark encouraged the people to make paths between their villages, and repeatedly defended them against the various slave-raiding gangs. As his Senga troops expanded, he conferred various grandiose titles on himself, including \\"King of the Senga\\" and \\"Chief of the Mashukulumbwe\\". All of this caused considerable annoyance to the Portuguese at Zumbo, though the boma coexisted with Clark's settlement for the most part. The most prominent trans-river clash came when Clark demonstrated the strength of his army by overpowering the fort's garrison, pulling down the Portuguese flag and running up the Union Jack in its place. He then returned to Feira, leaving the British flag flying over Zumbo. His point made, he made no attempt to stop the Portuguese garrison from returning.; The Portuguese arrested Clark at one point, according to one story, but released him after the native troopers refused to guard him, saying he was \\"too great a man to be arrested\\". A similar tale has Harrison Clark being captured in Mozambique and deported to Feira under guard by two Portuguese soldiers; these men found the journey so harrowing that Clark ended up escorting them back. According to one of Clark's indigenous followers, he once put an intruding Chikunda force to flight simply by bellowing at the enemy leader to \\"voetsek you bloody nigger\\". Clark consolidated his chieftainship by marrying a daughter of Mpuka, the chief of the Chikunda people; according to Deare this was just one of \\"the usual assortment of wives\\". In 1895 he relocated north to the confluence of the Lukasashi and Lunsemfwa Rivers, where he established his own village. He named the settlement \\"Algoa\\" after the Portuguese name for Port Elizabeth, and lived in a small stone fort he built. Writing in 1954, the historian W V Brelsford described Clark's sphere of influence from Algoa as \\"the Luano Valley and the uplands as far westwards as the Kafue and southwards to Feira\\". Contact with the British South Africa Company Earl Grey, the British South Africa Company administrator who Clark asked to honour his holdings in 1897.alt=A Victorian- looking, balding moustachioed gentleman. The British South Africa Company (BSAC), established by Cecil Rhodes in 1889, was designed to occupy and develop the area immediately north of the Transvaal, with the ultimate goal of aiding Rhodes's dream of a Cape to Cairo railway through British territory. Having a firm hold over Matabeleland, Mashonaland and Barotseland by 1894, the Company began officially calling its domain \\"Rhodesia\\" in 1895. The BSAC sought to further expand its influence north of the Zambezi, and to that end regularly sent expeditions into what was dubbed North-Eastern Rhodesia to negotiate concessions with local rulers and found settlements. In 1896, Major Deare led one such expedition north from the main seat of Company administration, Fort Salisbury, to meet with the Ngoni chief Mpezeni, who ruled to the east of Harrison Clark. One day, to Deare's surprise, a small group of warriors approached his party from the west, carrying a letter. This message, written in English and signed \\"Changa-Changa, Chief of the Mashukulumbwe\\"‚Äîthe name John Harrison Clark was given in the body of the letter‚Äîsaid that its author had heard of a white man being entertained recently by Mpezeni, and wished to provide the same hospitality at Algoa. \\"Really, wonders never cease!\\" Deare recalled. \\"I had heard of this man on the Zambezi and had known him well many years ago in the Cape Colony ... We had both lived in the same town for years. I learnt his story later.\\" It is unclear whether Deare took up Clark's invitation to Algoa. Harrison Clark subsequently sought protection from the British South Africa Company. He negotiated concessions with two neighbouring chiefs, Chintanda and Chapugira, each of whom signed over the mining and labour rights for his respective territory in return for a specified fee whenever Clark wished to use them.Documents included in In August 1897, Clark wrote to the Company administrator in Salisbury, Earl Grey, requesting that the Company honour these holdings, enclosing copies of the concessions he had secured. Also providing a cursory description of gold mining prospects in the region, Clark criticised the actions of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Warton, who was in the vicinity representing the North Charterland Exploration Company, a BSAC subsidiary. \\"Mashukulumbwe can be occupied without fighting,\\" he wrote. \\"I am on friendly terms with all the natives, and, if necessary, can raise a force of three to seven thousand to operate on Mfisini [Mpezeni] or Mashukulumbwe. Colonel Warton's Administration of this country has been a mistake; the country is rich in alluvial and reef gold.\\"Letter from Clark to Earl Grey (August 1897), included in The Company took little notice of Clark, but he continued in the same vein, acquiring similar concessions from the chiefs Chetentaunga, Luvimbie, Sinkermeronga and Mubruma over the following two years.Documents included in Clark wrote to the Company again on 12 April 1899, once more attaching copies of his concessions, with an offer to supply the BSAC settlements in Southern Rhodesia with contract labourers taken from among his neighbouring chiefs' populations. He said he had permission from all of the chiefs involved to do so. He requested as his fee ¬£1 per man, and said that he had agreed a monthly wage of 10 shillings for each worker plus food, accommodation and fuel. Having split his concessions into two sections to draw labour from, Clark proposed to provide Salisbury with workers from his eastern concessions, and Bulawayo with those from the west. The chiefs had agreed to provide workers on contracts lasting six months, but Clark wrote that he could attempt to supply labour all year round if the Company wished.Letter from Clark to Milton (April 1899), included in Decline and fall On 14 April 1899, Chief Chintanda gave a BSAC commissioner at Mazoe, Southern Rhodesia a statement in which, among other things, he asserted that Clark had been claiming to be a Company official and had been collecting tariffs such as hut tax under that pretence for at least two years. Clark's labour and mining concessions, Chintanda said, had been agreed under the impression that he represented the BSAC. Chintanda furthermore claimed that Clark was a prolific womaniser who had once raped a pregnant woman. \\"Whenever Clark sees a girl he fancies he takes her as his mistress for a few days, and when tired of her sends her home,\\" Chintanda said. \\"The fathers and husbands of these girls are constantly complaining to me about Clark's actions, but I can do nothing as Clark is a white man, and professed to be representing the government.\\" The chief asked the Company to send a genuine representative.Statement from Catino Francisco Lubino Chintanda (April 1899), included in Alfred Milner, the British High Commissioner for Southern Africaalt=A portrait photograph of a moustachioed gentleman Chintanda's affidavit caused the BSAC to become concerned about Clark's continued authority in North-Eastern Rhodesia and to begin investigating him more thoroughly. The situation was complicated when, after a month's perusal, the Company's lawyers resolved that the courts in Salisbury and Bulawayo held no jurisdiction outside Southern Rhodesia and therefore could not hear any case brought against Clark.Telegram detailing legal counsel (May 1899), included in On 4 July 1899, Arthur Lawley, the Company's administrator in Matabeleland, wrote to Cape Town to report the situation to the resident High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Alfred Milner. Lawley briefly summarised the charges against Clark and requested permission to hold a court north of the Zambezi under the supervision of one of three chiefs friendly to the Company.Letter from Lawley to Milner (July 1899), included in Milner replied on 17 August that he could not legally sanction this, and that Lawley should pursue the matter further only when authority extended over Clark's area.Letter from Milner to Lawley (August 1899), included in On 24 August 1899, Sub-Inspector A M Harte-Barry of the British South Africa Police interviewed Chief Mubruma, who corroborated much of what Chintanda had said regarding Clark's claims to represent the Company. Mubruma said that Clark had visited the previous week and had told him to have his men ready for work south of the river within a month. When told that Clark had no connection with the BSAC, Mubruma said that he would not give Clark the workers, but would readily take part in the kind of scheme he had suggested if the Company wished. He made no comment relevant to Clark's alleged sexual misconduct.Letter from Harte-Barry (August 1899), included in The BSAC established two forts to the north-west of Algoa in 1900, then a boma at Feira in 1902, bringing Mashukulumbwe under Company control. Harrison Clark said that his concessions gave him authority over the area and demanded that the Company pay him for them. The BSAC said Clark's documents were illegal and refused to deal with him. It offered him compensation, the form of which differs by source; Brelsford and a man who knew Clark personally during the 1920s, Colonel N O Earl Spurr, say that he was given farms as compensation, while a 1920s business acquaintance, A M Bentley, writes that the Company promised grants of land and the right to reserve some mining claims. Clark reluctantly accepted the compensation when he realised that to challenge the BSAC he would have to travel a great distance, possibly to England, and invest heavily in a court case he would probably lose. Later life and death alt=A tree with very widely spread branches, viewed from across the street Clark became a successful farmer, experimenting with the growing of rubber, cotton and other plants previously absent from the area. His cotton plantation developed promisingly for a few years, but he abandoned it after heavy rain destroyed an entire crop around 1909. He remained on the farm until the late 1910s, when he either gave or sold it to Catholic missionaries, and moved to Broken Hill, one of the largest settlements in what had become Northern Rhodesia in 1911. Here he lived for the rest of his life. Retaining \\"Changa- Changa\\" as a nickname, he helped to develop various businesses and events, acted as a partner in the first licensed brewery in Northern Rhodesia (alongside Lester Blake-Jolly), and became \\"one of the pillars of society in the Broken Hill of those days\\", according to Spurr. He owned one of the first automobiles in Northern Rhodesia‚Äîa dark green Ford Model T. According to Brelsford, the elderly Harrison Clark remained highly respected among the indigenous people and was sometimes called upon to settle disputes. His last job was personnel manager at a local mine. He dedicated his final years to the writing of a book about his life, the manuscript for which was lost when his house burned down. Clark alleged that the BSAC orchestrated the fire to stop him from publishing unflattering information about the early days of Company rule. He died from heart disease in Broken Hill on 9 December 1927, aged about 67, and was buried in the Protestant section of the town cemetery. The modest savings he possessed at the time of his death were left to his sister in Port Elizabeth. According to M D D Newitt, Clark embodied much of the pioneering spirit of the time and was \\"an object of legend\\" to his fellow frontiersmen. \\"He had led a wild, tough life but it had not turned him either into a rascal or into an uncouth bush dweller,\\" Brelsford writes. \\"Changa-Changa\\" endured in the local vernacular as a word roughly meaning \\"boss\\", and was still in use in Zambia in the 1970s. Summarising Clark's life, Peter Duignan and Lewis Gann conclude that he \\"experienced in his own person the transition from bush feudalism to capitalism.\\" References ;Journal articles  ;Bibliography   Further reading * Category:Northern Rhodesia people Category:South African explorers Category:Settlers of Zambia Category:Traditional rulers in Zambia Category:1860 births Category:1927 deaths Category:Explorers of Africa Category:Micronational leaders Category:North-Eastern Rhodesia Category:People from Port Elizabeth Category:South African emigrants to Zambia Category:South African military personnel Category:South African people of English descent Category:White South African people Category:Zambian businesspeople Category:Zambian farmers Category:Zambian people of English descent Category:19th-century explorers Category:19th-century British politicians Category:20th-century British politicians ","title":"John Harrison Clark"},{"id":"36610464","text":"Carolena Jean Carstens Salceda (born January 18, 1996 in Winfield, Illinois, United States) is a taekwondo practitioner representing Panama.

Original main characters  Before the Cheers pilot, \\"Give Me a Ring Sometime\\", was finalized and then aired in 1982, the series originally consisted of four employees of Cheers, the bar, in the original script. There was neither Norm Peterson nor Cliff Clavin, regular customers of Cheers; later revisions added them as part of the series.Wendt 2009, pp. 112‚Äì114. = Sam Malone = Samuel \\"Mayday\\" MaloneBjorklund e-Book, p. 141. (Ted Danson) -- a bartender and owner of Cheers. Sam is also a ladies' man. Before the series began, he was a relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox when he became (and still is) a friend of Coach, but then he became alcoholic, which took a toll on his baseball career. He has had on-again, off-again relationships with Diane Chambers, his opposite, in the first five seasons (1982-1987). During the breaks in their relationship Sam has flings with many not-so-bright \\"sexy women\\", but generally doesn't pursue relationships and fails to seduce some intellectual women. After Diane leaves Boston, he pursues Rebecca Howe, largely unsuccessfully. In the end, he is still unmarried, recovering from sexual addiction with help from Dr. Robert Sutton's (Gilbert Lewis) group meetings, advised by Frasier, in the penultimate episode \\"The Guy Can't Help It\\" (1993). Sam Malone was originally written as a former football player, but the casting of Ted Danson led writers to change Sam into an ex-baseball player. = Diane Chambers = Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) -- a highly academic, sophisticated college student. In the pilot, Diane is abandoned by her fianc√© Sumner Sloan (Michael McGuire), for whom she'd worked as an assistant, as he returns to his ex-wife. Without a job, money, or man, she reluctantly becomes a cocktail waitress. Over time, she becomes a close friend of Coach. She has an on-and-off relationship with bartender Sam Malone. When not involved with Sam, Diane dates men who fit her upper-class ideals, such as Frasier Crane. Later in the fifth season, she leaves Boston behind for a writing career and in the eleventh and final season lives in Los Angeles. = Coach = Ernie \\"Coach\\" PantussoBjorklund e-Book, p. 265. (or Pantuso) (Nicholas Colasanto) -- a \\"senile\\" co-bartender, widower, and retired baseball coach. Coach was also a friend of Sam and a close friend of Diane. He had a daughter, Lisa. Coach was often easily tricked, particularly into situations that put the bar at stake. Nevertheless, he listened to people's problems and then helped to them with advice and analyses. In the fourth season, Coach died without explicit explanation while the actor Colasanto himself died of a heart attack in February 1985. = Carla Tortelli = Carla Maria Victoria Angelina Teresa Apollonia LozuponeBjorklund e-Book, p. 199. (Rhea Perlman) -- a \\"wisecracking, cynical\\" cocktail waitress, who abuses customers. At the series premiere, she was the mother of four children and divorced from Nick Tortelli (Dan Hedaya). She flirts with men, including ones who are not interested in her, and believes in superstitions, but secretly carries the torch for Sam. She is both highly fertile and matrimonially inept. Carla's last husband, Eddie LeBec, a washed-up ice hockey goalie whom she married during the run of the show, eventually died in an ice show accident involving a Zamboni. Carla later discovered that Eddie had cheated on her, committing bigamy with another woman whom he had gotten pregnant. Carla's sleazy first husband, Nick Tortelli (Dan Hedaya), also made appearances, variously challenging Carla with a custody battle or a legal scam stemming from their divorce. Carla's eight children, four of whom were born during the show's run, were notoriously ill- behaved, except for Ludlow, whose father was a prominent academician. Perlman's real-life pregnancies were written into the series as Carla's pregnancies.\\"Top 10 Pregnant Performers: Where Everybody Knows You're Pregnant (or Not).\\" Time. Web. 2 June 2012. = Norm Peterson = Hilary Norman Peterson (George Wendt) -- a bar regular and semi-unemployed accountant, whose common name \\"Norm\\" is often shouted whenever he enters the bar. Outside the bar, he frequently changes jobs and has a troubled marriage with (but is still in love with and married to) Vera, an unseen character. Later in the series, he becomes a house painter, especially for Rebecca's bar office. (Despite a few fleeting appearances and vocal cameos, Vera's body is seen in the fifth- season episode \\"Thanksgiving Orphans\\" (1986), but her face is covered with a pumpkin pie. Her body is played by Bernadette Birkett, the real-life wife of George Wendt.Wendt 2009, p. 1.) Originally, there was no Norm Peterson. Wendt auditioned for a minor role George for the pilot episode, who was Diane Chambers' first customer and had only one word in one line: \\"Beer!\\"Wendt 2009, p. 112. After he was cast as George, Wendt's role was rewritten into Norm.Wendt 2009, p. 113. = Cliff Clavin = Clifford C. Clavin, Jr.Bjorklund e-Book, p. 241. (John Ratzenberger) -- a know-it-all bar regular and postman. He mostly lives with his mother, Esther Clavin (Frances Sternhagen), in the family house (until its on-screen destruction in season 6) and then in a condo, although he first purchases the condo as a bachelor pad for himself. He is ridiculed by friends and enemies alike, including Norm and Carla, for his know-it-all attitude. Cliff is mostly hopeless with women. His longest relationship is with fellow postal worker Margaret O'Keefe (Annie Golden), which begins during Cheers' seventh season (1988‚Äì89). When Margaret becomes pregnant with another man's child in 1993's \\"Do Not Forsake Me O My Postman\\", Cliff stays by her side as the baby's stepfather before Margaret returns to the child's biological father. In \\"The Barstoolie\\" (1985) Cliff meets his father, Cliff Clavin Sr. (Dick O'Neill), who left Cliff and his mother years earlier when Cliff was still a child. Cliff later realizes that his father is a fraudster and a fugitive from justice, and will run off again. Cliff does not want to turn his father in; Cliff Sr. disappears, leaving his son devastated. Ratzenberger auditioned for the Norm Peterson role but, sensing he would not get the role, Ratzenberger pitched the idea of a bar \\"know-it- all\\".Wendt 2009, pp. 113-114. The producers loved the idea so the security guard Cliff Clavin was added for the pilot. However, the producers changed his occupation into a postal worker because they perceived postal workers as more knowledgeable than security guards.  Subsequent main characters  Woody Boyd replaced Coach, who died off-screen in the fourth season. Frasier Crane began as a recurring guest role and became a permanent character. Rebecca Howe replaced Diane Chambers, who left Boston for a writing career in 1987. Lilith Sternin started as a one-time character in the Season 4 episode, \\"Second Time Around\\" (1986), and became a recurring character in Season 5 (1986‚Äì87), and a regular character for Season 10 and the episodes that she appears in for Season 11 (1992‚Äì93). = Frasier Crane and Lilith Sternin = Frasier W. CraneBjorklund e-Book, p. 257. (Kelsey Grammer) and Lilith Sternin (formerly Sternin-Crane) (Bebe Neuwirth) -- married psychiatrists and bar regulars, although Lilith rarely orders drinks. Frasier starts out as Diane Chambers's love interest. When she jilts him at the wedding altar in Europe, he ends up frequently going to Cheers pub for drinks and becomes everybody's bar friend. His first date with Lilith in \\"Second Time Around\\" (1986), Lilith's only episode of the fourth season, does not go well because they constantly argue. In the fifth season, Frasier and Lilith meet again when they are scheduled for a psychological talk show. With help from Diane, Frasier becomes aroused by Lilith's makeover, especially with her hair down, for the talk show. Frasier and Lilith flirt with each other on the talk show. Although they later feel guilty, Frasier and Lilith overcome their guilt with more help from Diane and begin their relationship. They move in together, get married, and in the seventh season (1988-89) conceive a son Frederick, who is born in the following eighth season (1989-90). Their marriage is strained when Lilith has an affair with Dr. Louis Pascal (Peter Vogt). In the Cheers spin-off Frasier, Frasier divorces her, gives custody of Frederick to Lilith, and moves from Boston to Seattle. Lilith appears in the spin-off recurringly. = Woody Boyd = Woodrow Tiberius BoydBjorklund e-Book, p. 215. (Woody Harrelson) -- a co- bartender, commonly called \\"Woody\\". When he arrived from his Midwest hometown to Boston, Woody wanted to meet his pen pal Coach. However, he finds out that Coach already died, and is hired to work at the bar. Later, he dates Kelly Gaines (Jackie Swanson) and then marries her. At the end, they have a son and daughter as revealed in Frasier. = Rebecca Howe = Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) -- a \\"voluptuously beautiful\\" manager and occasional waitress. Initially, she starts out a strong independent woman, but after several romantic failures with (mainly) rich men, she becomes \\"more neurotic, insecure, and sexually frustrated\\". At the start, Sam attempts to seduce Rebecca without success, but, when her persona changes, he loses interest in her. In the series finale, she marries the plumber Don Santry (Tom Berenger). In Frasier, according to Sam, she divorces Don and then ends up visiting the bar without working there again. Recurring characters Each of the following characters of Cheers may or may not be particularly significant to the story of the series; each was introduced in one season and would appear in subsequent seasons ‚Äî unless introduced in season 11, which was the last season. However, even when a character appeared earlier, information is arranged based on a character's first appearance rather than an actor's, especially when a same actor portrays different characters. Moreover, uncredited appearances are disregarded. = Introduced in season 1 =  Sumner Sloan  Sumner Sloan (Michael McGuire) is a college English literature professor for whom Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) worked as a teaching assistant. Divorced, Sumner became engaged to Diane, whom he left to return to his ex-wife, Barbara, flying to Barbados on the flight Diane had booked for them both.Season 1, Episode 1: Give Me a Ring Sometime Sumner tried secretly to win Diane back while she was seriously dating Sam Malone (Ted Danson), that attempt which ultimately failed. Diane ultimately states that it wasn't because Sam read War and Peace, but that he read it for her.Season 2, Episode 5: Sumner's Return In \\"I Do, Adieu\\" (1987), where he last appears, Sumner returns after he heard the news about Sam and Diane's engagement. Sumner tells Diane that he sent one of her unfinished manuscripts to one of his colleagues, who later praises it. He warns her that writing both a novel and being a housewife to Sam simultaneously is impossible. Moreover, he warns her that choosing one would put an end to the other, either her marriage or her writing talents. Diane orders Sumner to leave the bar right away, but after talking with Sam, she decides to invest six months of her time into the endeavour of finishing the book, and they ultimately do not marry.Season 5, Episode 26: I Do, Adieu  Harry the Hat  Harry Anderson, before and after television sitcom Night Court (1984-92), portrayed Harry the Hat in early 1980s and 1993. Harry \\"the Hat\\" Gittes (Harry Anderson) is a con artist who first appeared in \\"Sam at Eleven\\" (1982). More often, Harry has been kicked out by Sam for his confidence tricks, while Harry tricks bar customers into giving him money. In \\"Pick a Con... Any Con\\" (1983), Sam Malone (Ted Danson) bails Harry out of jail because Sam and Coach (Nicholas Colasanto) want him to spite a hustler, George Wheeler (Reid Shelton), who has been taking away $8,000 worth of bar assets from Coach at card games of gin rummy. Then Harry suggests poker, which he assumes that George may not be good at conning, and prices Sam's requests for $5,000. Later, Harry ends up \\"losing\\" to George at poker games. However, as discovered, Harry's hand was four of a kind (four 3s), which would have beaten George's straight hand. As they later admit, Harry and George have been cheating players, including Sam, at poker to take away their money. Therefore, they play a serious but final game. When Coach scratches his nose, George indicates a gesture that his three Queens (three of a kind) would beat Harry's hand. This time, however, Harry's four 3s in his hand beats George's hand, so Harry takes all the money and then leaves the bar. Nevertheless, as it turns out, the whole events are Harry and Coach's doings to spite George, so Harry comes back after George leaves and then gives everyone back $8,000. In \\"Bar Wars VII: The Naked Prey\\" (1993), Harry \\"refuses\\" to help out the Cheers gang spite Gary (Robert Desiderio; previously Joel Polis), who has been taunting the Cheers gang with superiority, pranks, and competitions. He tells the gang that they are naturally \\"losers\\" and that topping Gary is impossible. He cons Gary by pretending to be a contractor with a fake name. Gary has his own pub, Gary's Olde Towne Tavern, demolished under Harry's \\"contract\\" for millions, but then Gary realizes that he was conned and that the money does not exist. Harry hides while Gary angrily exits the bar to chase after him. At the end, as discovered, Harry takes a stash of money from Cheers's cash register for the gang's requests on Gary.  Dave Richards  Fred Dryer's auditioning for Sam Malone inspired creation of Dave Richards. Dave Richards (Fred Dryer) is a sports commentator, friend of former baseball player Sam Malone (Ted Danson), and also divorced. In \\"Sam at Eleven\\" (1982), Dave wants to interview Sam only because, unbeknownst to Sam, none of high-profile celebrities at Dave's priorities were available. However, when one of the high-profile sports celebrities (John McEnroe) is finally available, Dave halts his interview with Sam, which puts an end to Sam's second chance of fame. In \\"Old Flames\\" (1983), Dave realizes that Sam and Diane are together and bets that their relationship will end in 24 hours, so he and Sam will do debauchery with women. Then Dave sets Sam up with another woman to put his relationship with Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) at stake. However, Sam cannot fling with that woman because he still thinks about Diane. After time expires, Dave fails to break them up because Sam and Diane are still together. In \\"Love Thy Neighbor\\" (1985), Dave is heard on the radio, where he interviews Sam about Diane. In \\"'I' on Sports\\" (1987), Dave offers Sam a job as Dave's substitute for covering sports on television, which Sam accepts. (Nevertheless, Sam's news career is short-lived.) Fred Dryer originally auditioned for Sam Malone, a supposedly football player. Because he was a football player, Dryer was considered for that role. However, the role was already given to Ted Danson.Balk, Quentin, and Ben Falk. Television's Strangest Moments: Extraordinary but True Tales from the History of Television. London: Robson‚ÄìChrysalis, 2005. 166. Google Books. Web. February 10, 2012.  Paul  Paul (Paul Vaughn) was bar customer who appears recurringly until \\"Manager Coach\\" (1983), an episode of the second season (1983-1984). He spends most of his time antagonising Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger). He is not to be confused with Paul Krapence (Paul Willson).  Alan  Alan (Alan Koss) was a bar patron who appears recurringly through the show's entire run. In his first appearance \\"Let Me Count the Ways\\" (1983), Alan informs waitress Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) that she has given him a wrong drink. Immediately, she breaks into tears, so Alan tries to cheer her up without avail by \\"accepting\\" and then drinking the wrong order. In \\"The Heart Is the Lonely Snipe Hunter\\" (1985), he is one of the boys who purposely abandon Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) at the fabricated snipe hunting game. In \\"Those Lips, Those Ice\\" (1988), when Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) assumes that her then-husband Eddie (Jay Thomas) is cheating on her with another woman, Alan advises Carla to tell Eddie how she feels inside by expressing not only her heart but also her soul, so they both \\"give unto\\" each other. Norm Peterson (George Wendt) reacts by calling him a \\"clown\\".  Andy Schroeder  Andy Schroeder (Derek McGrath) is an ex-convict. Andy first appears in \\"Diane's Perfect Date\\" (1983) as Diane Chambers's (Shelley Long) blind date, paid by Sam Malone (Ted Danson), who calls him \\"Andy-Andy\\" because he does not know and has not asked his surname, for $20. As discovered, he killed the waitress in an Italian restaurant, Via Milano, and was imprisoned. He rides a motorcycle. During the date, Diane and Sam find Andy's comments murderous. Andy later reappears in \\"Homicidal Ham\\" (1983) and then holds people hostage to commit robbery with a gun. Fortunately, Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) catches him after he drops the gun. As learned, Andy has no job because of his past; nevertheless, Andy learned acting in high school. Diane convinces Sam not to send him to the police and, instead, gives him a chance to do performance in Shakespearean play Othello. Andy then falls in love with Diane, but he becomes jealous and then murderous when he see Sam and Diane kissing. At the play, performed in the bar, Andy chokes Diane to near death until Sam rescues her, and Norm Peterson (George Wendt) and Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) grab hold of Andy. Later, he is sometimes called \\"Andy-Andy\\" by characters and real-life sources alike. In \\"Diane's Nightmare\\" (1985), Andy marries Cynthia (Nancy Cartwright), but the whole thing turns out to be Diane's dream. In \\"Do Not Forsake Me, O' My Postman\\" (1992), Andy returns to the bar with bomb detonator around his body and wants to see Diane. Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson) tells him that Diane no longer works as a waitress anymore, so Andy leaves.  Boggs  Boggs (Duncan Ross) is a chauffeur to Helen Chambers (Glynis Johns), mother of Diane (Shelley Long). In \\"Someone Single, Someone Blue\\" (1983), Boggs repeatedly asks Diane to be his wife to help her mother Helen keep her inheritance under the late Spencer Chambers's will. When the time expires and Diane is still single, Helen loses all the wealth. Fortunately, as he admits, Boggs embezzled a healthy proportion of the Chambers's money in the past and has money still remaining. He proposes to be Helen's husband, and Helen accepts. In \\"Rebound, Part One\\" (1984), after Diane's huge breakup from Sam Malone (Ted Danson), Boggs takes Diane back from psychiatric hospital to her apartment. He notifies her that Helen felt uncomfortable contacting Diane while Diane was in the ward.  Justice Harrison Fiedler  Justice Harrison Fiedler (Dean Dittman) is a justice of the peace. In his first episode, \\"Someone Single, Someone Blue\\" (1983), he performs Sam and Diane's (almost) wedding, which is halted by Diane's mother Helen, who is appalled by their bickering toward each other. In his second and last episode, \\"Bar Bet\\" (1985), her performs a faux wedding of Sam and Jacqueline Bisset (not to be confused with the actress Jacqueline Bisset), whom Sam obtained to avoid losing his bar to his friend Eddie Gordon (Michael Richards). = Introduced in season 2 =  Tom  Tom (Tom Babson), an aspiring lawyer who studies law and attempts to pass the bar exam. He is primarily involved in main stories that involve legality, like financial will and parental custody. Sometimes, his credited surname is either Sherry or Babson. In \\"Chambers vs. Malone\\" (1987), he is a defense attorney for Sam Malone's (Ted Danson) court case of \\"assaulting\\" Diane Chambers (Shelley Long). Although Sam testifies that there was no assault, Tom requests that Sam propose to Diane in front of the court, which Sam reluctantly does. Actor Babson appeared previously as an unnamed customer in \\"The Tortelli Tort\\" (1982) and Barney in \\"The Boys in the Bar\\" (1983). His last episode is \\"Airport V\\" (1988).  Nick and Loretta Tortelli  Jean Kasem (right) portrayed Loretta Tortelli. Nick and Loretta Tortelli (Dan Hedaya and Jean Kasem) are married couple currently living in Las Vegas. In previous season, Nick was referenced, mostly by his ex-wife Carla (Rhea Perlman); as discovered, he was a deadbeat father and disloyal husband when he cheated on Carla with another woman. In their first episode \\"Battle of the Exes\\" (1983), after Nick and Loretta's wedding, Nick comes into the bar and then begs Carla to be together with him, despite that he is married to Loretta. However, Carla turns him down in \\"favor\\" of Sam Malone (Ted Danson) (although, unbeknownst to him, Sam and Carla pretend to be together at the wedding to make Nick jealous), and then Nick and Loretta leave. In \\"An American Family\\" (1984), Loretta discovered that she will never be able to produce children. Therefore, Nick and Loretta attempt to retrieve custody of one of Carla's children - eldest son Anthony (Timothy Williams) - without avail. In \\"If Ever I Would Leave You\\" (1985), Loretta kicks Nick out for not supporting her decision to join the singing group, so he goes to Cheers to work as a janitor to prove himself as a better man to Carla. Three weeks later, Loretta comes to the bar and then begs him to be still her husband. At first he refuses, but he realizes his mistake, prompting him to dump Carla again. In \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\" (1986), Nick and Loretta enter the dance competition against Sam and Carla, but both are disqualified during the contest. Nick and Carla dance for one time, and subsequently win the competition. At the bar, Nick begs Carla to be together with him again behind Loretta's back, but Carla, in retaliation, cracks an egg on his forehead. Nick and Loretta appear in their own short-lived spin-off The Tortellis, which lasted from January to May 1987. In \\"Spellbound\\" (1987), Loretta leaves Nick because she figures that Nick is not faithful to her. She then goes to Cheers to seek help from Carla and Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) for independence, such as becoming a singer. Nick arrives at the bar to woo Diane, Loretta, and then Carla with violinist and dinner without success. Diane advises Nick to improve his marriage with Loretta, so he leaves the bar trying to go after Loretta. In \\"Loathe and Marriage\\" (1993), Nick and Loretta come to his daughter Sarafina's (Leah Remini) wedding with a retired police officer, located at the bar. Carla tries to throw him out, but Sarafina convinces her to let Nick stay. At the wedding reception, Loretta sings.  Lewis  Lewis (Sam Scarber), an African- American \\"large, athletic male\\" postal worker. In the episode \\"Cliff's Rocky Moment\\" (1984), Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) attempts to have Lewis brawl with Victor (Peter Iacangelo) without avail. In fact, both Lewis and Victor cannot stand Cliff because of his know-it-all behavior, and Lewis leaves, resolving not to help Cliff. In his second and final episode \\"I Call Your Name\\" (1984), Lewis is fired from his job for stealing fragrant samples from people's mail (unbeknownst to him, Cliff had reported him). Lewis wants to find out the identity of the person who reported him to physically attack him, but ultimately he decides not to do so, having already found another job. In the book The Sitcom Reader, Robert S. Brown called him a stereotype of African Americans.  Steve  Steve (Steve Giannelli), a bar patron. His first episode is \\"Norman's Conquest\\" (1984); his final is \\"One for the Road\\" (1993), the series finale. Actor Gianelli previously appeared as unnamed customer in \\"No Help Wanted\\" (1984).  Al  Al (Al Rosen) was an elderly male bar patron. Over the series until the actor's death in 1990, Al may be involved in dialogues, especially cold openings. He has a distinct, gravelly voice and often unexpectedly interjected with a comedic one-liner relevant to what the characters are discussing, often leaving them speechless momentarily. In his first credited episode \\"Fortune and Men's Weight\\" (1984), when Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) asks men who the all-time \\"bigwig\\" is, Al declares \\"Sinatra\\" as an answer, bemusing patrons. In \\"Cheers: The Motion Picture\\" (1987), Al gives Woody Boyd's (Woody Harrelson) father a philosophical phrase that convinces him to let Woody stay in Boston rather than take him back to his hometown. In \\"Bar Wars\\" (1988), he attends Gary's Olde Towne Tavern, the bar that is Cheers' rival. His last credited episode is \\"The Improbable Dream: Part 2\\" (season 8, episode 2; 1989). In the Frasier episode \\"Cheerful Goodbyes\\" (2002), Cliff mistakenly refers Phil as Al; Phil corrects him by saying that Al died \\"fourteen years\\" earlier, i.e. 1988, contradicting Al Rosen's death in 1990 and last credited appearance. = Introduced in season 3 =  Larry  Larry (Larry Harpel) is a bar patron. Larry's first episode is \\"Diane Meets Mom\\" (1984); his last is \\"One Last Fling\\" (1987). Actor Harpel previously appeared in the season premiere \\"Rebound\\" (1984) as an unnamed customer.  Tim  Tim (Tim Cunningham) is a bar patron. He is one of boys in \\"The Heart Is the Lonely Snipe Hunter\\" (1985) who abandon Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer), who has been playing a snipe hunting game in the woods.Bjorklund e-Book, pp. 304+ Actor Tim Cunningham previously appeared as Chuck in the first season and Greg in the second.

In \\"A Diminished Rebecca with a Suspended Cliff\\" (1992), he and his brother, posing as a postal inspector named Henderson, trick Cliff into believing that all postal employees must wear a new uniform. = Introduced in season 4 =  Beth Curtis  Beth Curtis (Amanda Wyss) is an old-time girlfriend of Woody Boyd's (Woody Harrelson) from Indiana. In \\"Woody Goes Belly Up\\" (1985), Beth and Woody are reunited. During high school, both Woody and Beth were overweight, a problem which seemed to become resolved once they were separated; however, after their reunion, they end up overeating and people unsuccessfully attempt to help them overcome it. Fortunately, Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) tells Beth that she and Woody substitute overeating for premarital sex due to religious backgrounds. Although Sam Malone (Ted Danson) and Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) take the couple to dinner to help them control their eating habits, Woody and Beth end up taking Frasier's psychological advice seriously and make plans to have sex. In her second and last episode \\"The Book of Samuel\\" (1986), Beth ends up engaged to her fianc√© Leonard Twilley (John Brace), much to Woody's disappointment. Beth confesses that she and Woody are two different people who are not meant for each other: Woody is adventurous, while she settles down into commitment.  Anthony and Annie Tortelli  Anthony Tortelli (Timothy Williams) is the eldest son of Nick (Dan Hedaya) and Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman), and Annie (Mandy Ingber) is his wife. In \\"The Groom Wore Clearasil\\" (1985), teenagers Anthony and Annie want to be married with his mother Carla's permission, but Carla refuses and tries to keep them apart without avail because she assumes that Anthony resembles his deadbeat father Nick. Suddenly, Annie's cousin Gabrielle (Sherilyn Fenn) walks into the bar, and Anthony becomes attracted to her, much to Annie's dismay. Anthony and Annie also appear as regular characters in the short-lived spin-off The Tortellis (1987) and live with Nick and his wife Loretta (Jean Kasem). After the spin-off ended, in two-part episode \\"Little Carla, Happy at Last\\" (1987), married Anthony and Annie were kicked out by Nick and then decide to live with Carla. At the bar, they meet pregnant Carla's new husband Eddie LeBec (Jay Thomas) and then openly disdain him for getting Carla pregnant. In \\"Tale of Two Cuties\\" (1988), Annie finds her husband Anthony lazy because he has no job. Therefore, she works as a temporary waitress and then tries to flirt with the bartender Sam Malone (Ted Danson) repeatedly without avail. To try and win her back, Anthony finds a job at a burger joint. At the end, he walks in the bar with his work uniform to prove himself to Annie, who becomes flattered and praises him. In \\"Slumber Party Massacred\\" (1988), Anthony impregnated Annie and then announces it to Carla at dinner. Outraged and horrified that the Annie is pregnant at such a young age (and at the prospect of becoming a grandmother), Carla kicks them out and neither are heard from ever again, destroying the couple's plans to live with Carla and Eddie after their baby arrived. Neither Anthony or Annie appeared in season eleven for Anthony's sister Serafina's (Leah Remini) wedding, but in Season 10's \\"Unplanned Parenthood\\", Gino (Josh Lozoff) mentions that Anthony is in prison.  Gary  Gary (rotatingly Joel Polis and Robert Desiderio) is a bartender and an owner of his own pub Gary's Olde Town Tavern. Often he challenges Sam Malone (Ted Danson) and other Cheers patrons in contests and then wins them in his appearances. Nevertheless, in his first episode \\"From Beer to Eternity\\" (1985), Diane Chambers's (Shelley Long) strike in bowling helps the Cheers team win the game. In his final episode \\"Bar Wars VII: The Naked Prey\\" (1993), Gary has his bar demolished by Harry the Hat (Harry Anderson), who uses fake name, for millions of dollars. However, Gary realizes that Harry is a fake when Harry's check bounced, leaving Gary without money and the bar.  Paul Krapence  Paul Krapence (Paul Willson) is a bar patron. His first episode is \\"Fools and Their Money\\" (1985), and his last is the series finale \\"One for the Road\\". More often he is excluded from the Cheers gang's activitiesBjorklund e-Book, p. 132. except some, which \\"he insisted\\".Bjorklund e-Book, p. 137. In \\"It's Lonely on the Top\\" (1993), Paul had sex with drunk Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) offscreen, which she regrets, while he becomes proud. However, Sam Malone (Ted Danson) orders him not to tell anyone about this for everyone's sake. Actor Paul Willson appeared previously in Cheers as Glen (although credited as \\"Gregg\\") in \\"Someone Single, Single Blue\\" (1983) and as Tom in \\"Little Sister, Don't Cha\\" (1983). As discovered in \\"The Show Where Sam Shows Up\\", an episode of the spin-off Frasier, Paul slept with Sam's fianc√©e Sheila (T√©a Leoni). However, Sam becomes angrier when he finds out about her and Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger), which ends Sam's relationship with her. Paul's only Frasier episode that he appears in is \\"Cheerful Goodbyes\\" (2002).  139th Street Quartet  139th Street Quartet is a barbershop quartet consisting of the 1st Tenor (Doug Anderson), the Bass (Jim Kline), and the Baritone (Peter Neushel), and a fourth member. The fourth member is 2nd Tenor (Larry F. Wright) in \\"Dark Imaginings\\" (1986) and a replacement portrayed by John Sherburn in \\"The Stork Brings a Crane\\" (1989). In the cold open of \\"Dark Imaginings\\", the Bass quits after one of quartet members chides him for costing them their chance to win a championship. Norm tries out the quartet to fulfill his lifelong dream only to then abandon it immediately. In \\"The Stork Brings a Crane\\", the quartet performs all day on Cheers's centennial anniversary party, much to bar patrons' annoyance, until Sam chokes one of them off-screen.  Phil  Phil (Philip Perlman) is a regular bar patron who appears throughout the series beginning in the fourth season. Perlman was the father of Cheers cast member Rhea Perlman.  Corinne  Corinne (Doris Grau), an elderly waitress, hired by Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson) in her first episode \\"Diane Chambers Day\\" (1986). As discovered, she also works as a waitress at Norm Peterson's (George Wendt) favorite restaurant, The Hungry Heifer. Her last episode is \\"Cheers: The Motion Picture\\" (1987). Portrayer Doris Grau was also a script supervisor of Cheers.Bjorklund e-Book, p. 282+. = Introduced in season 5 =  Esther Clavin  Frances Sternhagen Esther \\"Ma\\" Clavin (Frances Sternhagen) is the mother of Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger). Before her physical appearances, a lot is learnt about her, mainly through her son. As learned in \\"Sam Turns the Other Cheek\\" (1984), her husband Cliff Sr (Dick O'Neill) left her and their son behind. In the episode \\"Just Three Friends\\", when Cliff and Norm Peterson (George Wendt) make a prank call to her. It is first mentioned in the third season that Cliff lives with his her, for which the other barflies mocked him. In the episode \\"Coach in Love Part 2\\", Cliff's mother is heard in a voice- over. When she asked if she could stop by and meet the gang, Cliff whispered under his breath \\"When Hell freezes over\\". Regardless, Esther first appears in, \\"Money Dearest\\" (1986), and becomes engaged to a wealthy man Duncan Fitzgerald (Richard Erdman) upon Cliff's urging. Cliff tries to persuade Esther to break off the engagement when Esther makes Duncan donate half his fortune to charity, but Duncan dies hours later, leaving her heartbroken. Esther's appearances at the bar gives an insight into Cliff's know-it-all personality, as Esther spouts even more useless facts than Cliff; Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) remarks that, after meeting Esther, he sees Cliff as \\"almost heroically\\" well-adjusted. One of Esther's pastimes is making pretzels in unintentionally unusual shapes, which Cliff brings them into the bar in \\"Second Time Around\\" (1986). Patrons find them awful to taste, but is unable to tell him without hurting Esther's feelings. Therefore, Cliff brings them again in other episodes. In \\"The Last Angry Mailman\\" (1987), Esther sells their house only to have it bulldozed and then replaced by a convenience store. Since then, they live in an apartment together, which first appears in \\"My Fair Clavin\\" (1987). In \\"Look Before You Sleep\\" (1993), witnessed by Sam Malone (Ted Danson), Cliff and Esther argue over their lives together, including how dateless Cliff is, but then apologize, which stuns Sam. In her \\"Rebecca Gaines, Rebecca Loses\\" (1993), Cliff sends Esther to a senior center but then regrets it, despite her obvious pleasure about living there. Cliff eventually takes her back into the apartment, feeling guilty for dumping Esther in a home.  Vera Peterson  Vera Peterson (n√©e Kreitzer) (Bernadette Birkett) is the wife of Norm Peterson (George Wendt) Most of Vera's appearances were uncredited voiceovers, although her body is seen in the fifth season episode \\"Thanksgiving Orphans\\"; her face is covered by filling from a pie Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) threw at Norm. In the ninth season episode \\"It's A Wonderful Wife\\" her legs can be seen through the bar's front window as she sits crying on the steps after being fired from her job at Melville's as a hat-check girl. Birkett's only credited appearance is in Season 11's \\"Look Before You Sleep\\". Vera's background is briefly mentioned throughout the series: she and Norm were high school sweethearts, Vera was a cheerleader, and they married soon after graduating. In \\"Truce or Consequences\\" (1982), the two celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary (which they celebrate by going for pizza, so Norm can \\"get back here [the bar] by ten\\"), which means they married at some point in 1972. Vera's family, who also remain unseen, frequently descend upon the Peterson household. Vera's (much) younger sister, Donna, is the most frequent visitor, and usually stays for extended periods of time. Norm claims to dread these visits because, while he considers her more attractive than Vera, she relentlessly hits on him; he claims to have once walked in on Donna while she was naked and she tried to cover herself up with an emery board. In \\"One Hugs, The Other Doesn't\\" (1992), Norm mentions that Vera has nieces and nephews, which means Vera must have at least one brother or another sister. While generally tolerating Donna and Vera's other relatives, Norm shows a dislike to her parents: when Vera's mother stays with them, Norm was assigned to take her to visit Bunker Hill, but he instead locked her in the car and went to the bar like normal. A conversation at the bar revealed that Norm doesn't know if Vera's father is alive or not; when he calls her and asks, she refuses to speak to him for several days (and the issue is never clarified). Despite being the frequent butt of Norm's jokes, he professes a deep love for Vera. When they separate following Norm's inability to hold down a job, Norm slumps without her. When he learns that Vera is being wooed by former high school wrestling rival Wally Bodell (Walter Olkewicz) in \\"They Called Me Mayday\\" (1983), Norm challenged Wally to a wrestling match in order to win her back; when Vera learns of this, it leads to her reconciling with Norm. In \\"Love Thy Neighbour\\" (1985), Phyllis Henshaw (Miriam Flynn) visits the bar, voicing her suspicions that her husband Ron is having an affair with Vera. Norm is subsequently distraught at the thought of Vera cheating on him and the prospect of him leaving her; despite that, he refuses to have an affair with Phyllis out of spite, still feeling a certain loyalty to Vera. In \\"Feeble Attraction\\" (1990), Norm's secretary Doris (Cynthia Stevenson) reveals that she has developed feelings for Norm, which flusters him, although he is soon rid of the problem when he has to close the business down. In \\"Norm's Big Audit\\" (1993), when IRS agent Dot Carroll (Sharon Barr) offers to overlook Norm's tax evasion in exchange for sexual favours, Norm refuses to betray Vera (a decision that may have been influenced by his fear and disgust for Dot). In \\"The Two Faces of Norm\\" (1989), Norm scares his employee Rudi (Eric Allen Kramer) by using an alternate personality, harsh-hearted Anton Kreitzer, to scare them into shape. When asked by Frasier where he came up with the name Kreitzer, Norm reveals that it was Vera's maiden name.  Hugh  Hugh (Hugh Maguire) is a tall, balding (with a fringe of dark hair) bar patron wearing usually a beige or brown sport jacket and tie. His first episode is \\"Chambers vs. Malone\\" (1987), and his last is \\"Jumping Jerks\\" (1988). In the cold opening of \\"Chambers vs. Malone\\", Hugh sits with Pete and Mark at one table, forgetting who is the \\"designated driver\\" while intoxicated. Sam calls a taxicab company to take them home.  Pete  Pete (Peter Schreiner) is a friendly blonde man seen usually in casual clothing. His first episode is \\"Chambers vs. Malone\\" (1987), and his last is \\"One for the Road\\" (1993). In the cold opening of \\"Chambers vs. Malone\\", Pete sits with Hugh and Mark at one table, forgetting who is the \\"designated driver\\" while intoxicated. Sam calls a taxicab company to take them home.  Mark  Mark (Mark Arnott) is a man with a black hair wearing usually a suit. His first episode is \\"Chambers vs. Malone\\" (1987), and his last is \\"Indoor Fun with Sam and Robby\\" (1990). In the cold opening of \\"Chambers vs. Malone\\", Mark sits with Hugh and Pete at one table. Seeing them forget who is the \\"designated driver\\" while intoxicated, Hugh agrees with Sam calling them a taxicab ride home.  Eddie LeBec  Jay Thomas portrays Carla's second husband, Eddie LeBec In two-part episode \\"Never Love a Goalie\\" (1987), Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) meets the Boston Bruins ice hockey player, Guy \\"Eddie\\" LeBec (Jay Thomas), who has an endless winning streak and a French Canadian background, and then begins to date him. However, because of their relationship, Eddie's streak unfortunately comes to an end. Since both are superstitious, they end their relationship in order to avoid ruining Eddie's ability to play. They nevertheless reconcile shortly thereafter and promise to break up repeatedly before every game to avoid the \\"curse\\". In \\"Home Is the Sailor\\", Carla is revealed to be several months pregnant with Eddie's twins (incorporated by another of Perlman's pregnancies). In the two- part episode \\"Little Carla, Happy at Last\\", Carla and Eddie wed. She almost quits her waitressing job because Eddie said that he would take care of her financially. However, the Bruins released him from his contract due to his age and declining athletic performance, and he could not find another team. In \\"Airport V\\" (1988), Eddie ends up as a penguin mascot for a traveling ice show in another state. Later in the 1987‚Äì88 season, Carla gives birth to their twin boys, named Elvis and Jesse, after Carla's idol Elvis Presley and his stillborn twin brother. In \\"Death Takes a Holiday on Ice\\" (1989), Eddie is killed by an ice resurfacer when he saves the life of another member of the ice show. At the funeral, it was revealed that he had bigamously married another woman, Gloria (Anne De Salvo), and had twins with her as well. Carla changes her surname back to Tortelli to avoid being confused with the other \\"Mrs. LeBec\\". The demise of Jay Thomas's character Eddie LeBec has been claimed to stem from Thomas's comments \\"about\\" Perlman in a radio show. However, Thomas denied this and declared that he was referring only to the Carla character. Despite Ken Levine's praise of Thomas's acting and pairing of Eddie and Carla, Eddie was written out of the show because Perlman thought that the pairing would make her \\"not part of the people in the bar.\\" = Introduced in season 6 =  Joanne  Joanne (Catherine MacNeal) is a local newscaster. In \\"'I' on Sports\\" (1987), her short-time co-newsanchor Sam Malone (Ted Danson) flirts with her, but she resists and turns him down. In \\"Christmas Cheers\\" (1987), she reports a raging lunatic (presumably Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger)) throwing canned foods at the airplane. In her last episode \\"Where Nobody Knows Your Name\\" (1990), she reports that imprisoned millionaire Robin Colcord (Roger Rees) cheated on Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) with another woman. = Introduced in season 7 = Father Barry Father Barry (Eric Christmas), a priest, who usually gives advice about sexuality and spirituality. His first episode is \\"Swear to God\\" (1988), and his last is \\"Achilles Hill\\" (1991). In \\"Death Takes a Holiday on Ice\\" (1990), he officiates at Eddie LeBec's (Jay Thomas) funeral, where Eddie's bigamy is revealed when Eddie's second wife appears, shocking the invited guests, including Eddie's widow Carla and Father Barry. Mr. Sheridan Mr. Sheridan (Michael Currie) is corporate vice president for the Lilian Corporation, of which Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) is a minor executive. In \\"Adventures in Housesitting\\" (1989), he assigns her to babysit his doberman Sir Broundwin the Gallant, also called Buster, while he leaves for a business trip. During Rebecca's care, Buster runs away from Mr. Sheridan's manor, so Woody brings in another doberman Satan, a wrecking yard's dog resembling Buster, to conceal this negligence. Then Mr. Sheridan returns from the trip and pets Satan, fully unaware of the situation. Then Sam brings Buster, retrieved by a neighbor, through the backdoor to switch the dogs in the kitchen. To prevent Mr. Sheridan from entering the kitchen where the ruckus occurs, Rebecca distracts Mr. Sheridan by discussing a trophy-looking urn, which he reveals contains his late wife's ashes. Later at the Cheers bar, the bar regulars are unsure whether the dogs were successfully switched; Cliff says \\"Geronimo\\" as one of the Indian names that provokes the dog to attack him, confirming the dog to be Satan. In \\"For Real Men Only\\" (1989), Mr. Sheridan assigns Rebecca to manage a retirement party at the bar for an employee, Larry, also his brother-in-law. The party turns out depressing mainly because Larry is very dull to entertain. After failed efforts to enliven up the party, Rebecca jadedly allows newborn Frederick Crane's bris to take place at the same time. Consequently, the retirement party livens up, and Larry plans to marry a woman, pleasing Mr. Sheridan, who wants Larry out of the house. Maggie O'Keefe Margaret Catherine \\"Maggie\\" O'Keefe (Annie Golden) is a recurring love interest for Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) from the seventh season onward. Maggie first appears in \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" (season 7, episode 12) as a rookie postal carrier who is to be trained by Cliff. Maggie asks Cliff out, and he accepts. However, Maggie is later caught taking a postal vehicle to a motel and is fired. She then leaves Cliff to go to Canada to join the Canadian post office. She makes regular appearances thereafter, leading to her and Cliff's on-again, off-again relationship. Maggie reappears in season eleven episode \\"Do Not Forsake Me, O' My Postman\\" (her final appearance), informing Cliff that she is pregnant with Cliff's child. This forced Cliff to admit that he and Maggie never had sex, causing the other barflies to mock him. Cliff agrees to marry Maggie. Before they depart, she decides to call her child's real father, so Cliff would not worry anymore. She then tells Norm that the father is upset someone else will be raising his child and that he wants to marry her and Cliff is off the hook. However, as she leaves she tells Cliff they did have sex, twice, though Cliff was apparently inebriated and did not remember. Kelly Gaines Kelly Susan Boyd (n√©e Gaines) (Jackie Swanson) is a love interest (and later wife) for Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson) from the seventh season. She appeared in twenty-four episodes. Kelly and Woody first meet in the thirteenth episode of the seventh season. Woody and Sam Malone (Ted Danson) are bartending at a private party to celebrate Kelly's return from Europe. Kelly is a rich and sheltered girl, but Woody is able to open her eyes to new experiences, the first being a monster truck pull. Again in Kelly's third appearance in the nineteenth episode of the seventh season, Woody teaches her a lesson from his world. Instead of buying her an expensive gift for her birthday, he writes her a memorable song. Kelly and Woody marry in the tenth season's finale episode. The marriage, at the Gaines' mansion, is a fiasco: The minister dies; Kelly's flirtatious cousin Monika (Colleen Morris) teases Sam until her fanatically- jealous husband brandishes a sword; Rebecca Howe's (Kirstie Alley) petulance causes the French chef to quit, leaving her in charge of the food; Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) keeps getting pushed down the shaft in the dumbwaiter; Woody cannot keep his hands (and other things) off Kelly before the ceremony; and two attack dogs (cf. \\"The Lads\\" on Magnum, P.I.) menace everyone who dared exit the kitchen to the patio, until an infuriated Carla chases them inside, at which time they whimper like puppies and scamper away. To top it off, the dead body of the minister tips over and topples the wedding cake to the floor. Despite this, the wedding goes ahead. Kelly and Woody were expecting their first child when Cheers ended. In the sixteenth episode of the second season of Frasier, Sam visits and it is revealed that Kelly and Woody's first child was a baby boy. In the thirteenth episode of the sixth season, Woody visits Seattle and reveals that he and Kelly have had another child, a girl. Walter Gaines Walter Gaines (Richard Doyle) is Kelly's (Jackie Swanson) father and one of Rebecca Howe's (Kirstie Alley) corporate executives. Since his first episode \\"Golden Boyd\\" (1989), Walter usually disapproves of Kelly and Woody being together. Eventually, he accepts the relationship when they become married in \\"An Old Fashioned Wedding\\" (1992). In \\"Ill-Gotten Gaines\\" (1992), he has a brief affair with his married sister-in- law Katherine (Sondra Currie). In \\"Rebecca Gaines, Rebecca Loses\\" (1993), Walter asks Rebecca for a date at the bar, even after she gets drunk and then humiliates him at the party in the house. However, Rebecca turns him down because she identifies herself as a golddigger. Walter is divorced from Roxanne (Melendy Britt), who appears in \\"Woody Or Won't He\\" (1990). Walter's mother (Celeste Holm) accepts Woody as a husband for Kelly in the episode \\"No Rest for Woody\\" (1992). Ludlow Tortelli Ludlow Tortelli (Jarrett Lennon) is Carla Tortelli's (Rhea Perlman) youngest son. Nicknamed \\"Lud\\" by Carla, he is named for his absentee father ‚Äì the esteemed psychiatrist (and mentor of Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer)), Dr. Bennett Ludlow (James Karen) ‚Äì and is conceived in \\"Whodunit?\\" (season 3, episode 13). He first appears in the Season 7 episode \\"I Kid You Not\\", when his coach drops him off at Cheers after his T-ball game. After Carla asks him how the game went, it becomes clear Lud is much better suited for intellectual activities than sports (\\"They finally put me in after the kid with the cast on his leg and the two fat girls left\\"). Frasier and his wife Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth) take a shine to the bright and inquisitive youngster and offer to take him to an opera, to which Lud happily agrees. Excited at the opportunity to mentor Ludlow, the Cranes continue to invite him out to one high-minded activity after another, which eventually alienates Carla. Feeling bad for taking away her time with son, the Cranes invite her and Ludlow to dinner at a fancy restaurant. However, Ludlow dislikes the food and crawls under the table in protest. Frasier attempts to lure him out with psychology, but Ludlow responds by giving Frasier the \\"hot foot\\" treatment, effectively ending their mentorship. Carla lures Lud out from the table with the promise of taking him out for hamburgers but then orders him to apologize to Frasier for the incident, which Ludlow does. He is also mentioned (in name only) in season 6, episode 13 \\"Woody for Hire Meets Norman of the Apes\\" as Carla is describing the horrible things her kids did that day; apparently, Ludlow unplugged the freezer to see if frozen peas defrosted quicker than ice-cream. Ludlow appears briefly in two more episodes: \\"Unplanned Parenthood\\" (1991) and \\"Rich Man, Wood Man\\" (1992), the latter in which he sells chocolate candy. = Introduced in season 8 =  Robin Colcord  Robin Colcord (Roger Rees), was an English multi-millionaire industrialist, who spent most of his time on Cheers as a love interest for the gold-digging Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley). This led to his developing something of a rivalry with Sam Malone (Ted Danson), because of Sam's own romantic interest in Rebecca. In November 1989 Rees told a news agency Knight- Ridder Wire about the creation of the character: > They needed a fillip, to give them a boost, someone to drive Sam [Malone] > crazy. Robin's there to be dashing, sexy, irritating. He's not as charming > and nice as he appears to be at first sight. He's sort of the villain of the > piece. He's a megalomaniac millionaire. He's got an airline and a helicopter > fleet. It's very much Donald Trump. In January 1990, actor Rees said that he had not based \\"the character on anyone\\", despite \\"speculation that Colcord was a British version of Trump,\\" wrote Phil Kloer of Cox News Service. In season 8, Rebecca and Sam discovers that Robin was plotting a hostile takeover of the company for which Rebecca worked,Season 8, Episode 25: Cry Hard the Lilian Corporation, and had been secretly and illegally using Rebecca's access to the company's confidential information. Rebecca chooses to conceal Robin's activities for the sake of their relationship. However, Sam discovers that the company suspected Rebecca of being a willing corporate spy. To protect her, Sam reveals Robin's crimes. Amidst the ensuing scandal, Robin is arrested and briefly sent to prison as well as losing his business positions and money. In season 9, he and Rebecca plan to marry on his release, despite his new humble status. She chooses not to go through with this. He then reveals that he still had some of his fortune in a secret stash, but that he would go away if she still had not changed her mind. Believing this to be a bluff, she refuses yet again, and watches as he walks out of her life carrying a moneybelt which he had concealed in her desk. In his last appearance at \\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Bar\\", an episode of season 11, Robin claims to be a broke but humble vagabond and petty fugitive, asking to reunite with Rebecca. The episode ends with him and Rebecca attempting to hitchhike out of town, while Rebecca believes that this is a second test. = Introduced in season 9 =  Kevin McHale  Kevin McHale (himself) is a Boston Celtics player. In \\"Cheers Fouls Out\\" (1990), he plays for Cheers's basketball team against rival bar Gary's Olde Towne Tavern. McHale is told by Sam Malone (Ted Danson) that the game is a charity match; when he finds out that it is a lie, he tells Sam that he will play if they donate the winnings to charity. During one of the games, he is injured but quickly recovers. In \\"Where Have All the Floorboards Gone?\\" (1991), McHale is brought by Sam as a birthday present to Norm Peterson (George Wendt). Bar patrons, mostly Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger), feed McHale bar trivia including asking a question about the number of bolts in the floorboards in Boston Garden. McHale becomes obsessed with this question, and it severely affects his basketball performance. The gang try to undo the damage but to no avail; they break into a basketball stadium overnight and end up ruining the floor.  John Allen Hill  John Allen Hill (Keene Curtis) is a restaurateur who becomes the owner of Melville's, the seafood restaurant above Cheers, in season 9. He informs Sam that the deed for Melville's includes Cheers' bathrooms and pool room, and after some resistance Sam eventually capitulates and begins paying monthly rent to him, until Sam and Rebecca team up to purchase the rooms. Sam despises him due to his condescending and disdainful manner. Hill and Carla have a combative relationship that frequently turns sexual.  Henr√≠  Henr√≠ (Anthony Cistaro) is a French photographer who becomes friends with Kelly Gaines during her time abroad in Paris. Woody finds his frequent \\"jokes\\" about stealing Kelly away from him tiresome, and he does on one occasion attempt to trick Kelly into a supposed green card marriage. He is a lothario who is familiar with Sam's playboy reputation among stewardesses. = Introduced in season 10 =  Sarafina Tortelli  Sarafina Tortelli (Leah Remini) is the eldest daughter of Nick (Dan Hedaya) and Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman). She first appears, albeit briefly, in the episode \\"Unplanned Parenthood.\\" Sam Malone (Ted Danson) and Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) decide they should babysit Carla's kids in order to hone their parental skills. Arriving at Carla's house, Rebecca blows a whistle to line up all their kids (a la the Von Trapp family in The Sound of Music). Sarafina promptly informs them she is spending the night with her boyfriend and knocks the whistle into Rebecca's mouth, causing her to choke on it. She ends up staying against her will through dinner but warns Sam and Rebecca they better let her go as her boyfriend is a retired cop. Her second, and more prominent, appearance was in \\"Loathe and Marriage\\", where she weds her retired cop boyfriend, Pat McDougall (Dennis Cockrum). The ceremony is disrupted by the unexpected arrival of her deadbeat father Nick and his wife Loretta (Jean Kasem). Carla insists Nick leave but Sarafina objects, telling Carla she knows he's a terrible father but she still wants him there - she had always pictured her dad giving her away on her wedding day. Sarafina asks Carla how it made her feel that her own father missed her wedding. Carla admits it made her feel \\"pretty rotten\\" and, seeing Sarafina's point, relents and lets Nick stay. She is previously mentioned in \\"Woody for Hire Meets Norman of the Apes\\", as Carla is describing the horrible things her kids did that day. Apparently, Sarafina took a pair of hedge clippers to the shag carpet. = Introduced in season 11 = Characters appearing in only one season Each of the following characters of Cheers or real-life people portraying themselves, notable or not, appears in only one season.

Among pilots in his air group, the 70th Sentai, Yoshida downed the second-highest number of B-29s: six confirmed and one probable. He was awarded the Bukosho, the highest award given by the Imperial Japanese Army to soldiers who demonstrated (and survived) exceptionally valorous action in combat. Career In 1921, Yoshida was born in Hiroshima, the capital of Hiroshima Prefecture. In 1939, he enrolled as an officer candidate in the 55th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force Academy northwest of Tokyo. He completed his studies in March 1942 and was directed to the Akeno Fighter School to learn advanced fighter techniques. After this he was assigned to the 70th Sentai, flying the Nakajima Ki-44 Sh≈çki, called \\"Tojo\\" by the Allies of World War II. On 29 July 1944, American XX Bomber Command attacked Japanese military forces in Anshan, Manchuria, with 96 very heavy bombers. In August, Yoshida's air group moved to the Anshan area to provide air defense, flying the uprated Ki-44-II, with four larger 12.7 mm (.5 in) machine guns and a more powerful engine. On 8 September, 108 of the B-29s returned. The 70th Sentai rose to meet them and First Lieutenant Yoshida claimed one probable. American B-29 groups were next directed to bomb Japan itself, so to counter the attacks the 70th Sentai was transferred in November 1944 to Kashiwa, Chiba, northeast of Tokyo. The fighter pilots were given newer 20 mm Ho-5 cannon-equipped Nakajima Ki-84 machines, called \\"Frank\\" by the Allies. In February, Captain Yoshida was made the leader of 3rd Chutai; a position he held until the end of the war in August 1945. He brought to his squadron an aggressive determination to score against the B-29s; on 13 April and again on 15 April he shot down a B-29 in night actions. He scored against four more in the following six weeks‚Äîall at night. Yoshida was awarded the Bukosho, his citation mentioning the bravery of the September 1944 action in the obsolescent Ki-44. In the summer of 1945, Yoshida underwent testing to see if he was physically fit enough to fly the rocket-powered Mitsubishi J8M Sh≈´sui, Japan's copy of the German Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet. The war ended before he was able to fly one of these aircraft.

Much of the remaining land area is considered \\"open spaces,\\" while one dunam is classified as built-up areas. Israeli authorities are pressing the residents to leave. History Pottery shards at Zanuta indicate continuous settlement since the Iron Age, and archeologist Avi Ofer has proposed an identification of the site with Dana in the fifth group of Judean cities in the south Hebron hills.. Some of the ruins apparently dated to Byzantine period, but there was also signs of the recent destruction of a village.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 411. Byzantine pottery has been found in the village.Dauphin, 1998, p. 974 French explorer and amateur archaeologist Victor Gu√©rin passed through the area in 1863, and described its ruins, which were strewn over the summit and flanks of the hill. He found: > Numerous tumbled-down houses, of average size, that had mostly been built in > earlier times from regularly cut stones, nearly all of which enclosed a cave > drilled out of the rockface; cisterns lay around on all sides, and there was > a pool (birket) dug partially from the rock, and partially built from stone, > measuring 20 by 17 paces. There were also traces of an ancient mosque, > constructed, particularly in its corners, with magnificent masonry that had > no doubt been harvested from a Christian basilicaConder and Kitchener: > 'These ruins seem probably of Byzantine period, but there are remains of a > village probably destroyed in recent times.' p.411. ... Not to be overlooked > also were the remains of a small freestone structure, with all the > appearance of a sanctuary, perhaps a mausoleum dating back to the Roman > period. All that survives of it is a section of wall rising from the bedrock > and embellished with two pilastersConder and Kitchener corrected this later: > 'The wall of a building is standing in a line 15¬∞ west of north. It has five > pilasters, which stand on a podium or stylobate, and project 1 inch. Their > shafts are 17 inches broad. The total length of the wall is 23 feet.

Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 410 between which one > can see a vaulted niche touched off with elegant mouldings and probably > designed to house a small statue.Gu√©rin, 1869, p. 200 The place was also surveyed in 1874, and extensive ruins were found, including the remains of a \\"good-sized mosque.\\" Zanuta was a cave settlement of local peoples predating both the foundation of Israel (1948)Amira Hass, 'High Court to State: Explain Plan to Raze West Bank Bedouin Village,' Haaretz 11 September 2015. and Israel's occupation of the West Bank after the Six-Day War in 1967, and archaeological studies attest to continuous habitation at the site from the Byzantine to the Ottoman period, when it eventually dwindled to \\"a settlement of shepherds and fellahs living in the remains of the ancient structures and the residential caves alongside them,\\" of families that, according to Shuli Hartman, came to the caves from the nearby town of ad- Dhahiriya in the early 20th century. David Grossman writes it was a large cave settlement in the early 1800s. When the caves became uninhabitable in the 1980s, the villagers built stone houses with tin and plastic roofs to dwell in, and kept external pens and the caves as shelters for their sheep.ACRI,'Cancelling Demolition Orders in Area C Village (Khirbet Zanuta Petition),' at Association for Civil Rights in Israel,' July 22, 2012. Moves to demolish the village In 2007, Zanuta residents, assisted by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, filed a joint petition to the High Court of Justice asking that the Civil Administration provide them with a complete construction plan. As a result of the petition they received an interim order from the court. In 2011, an Israeli NGO Regavim, whose objective, according to Hass is 'to protect what it calls national (Jewish) land and to demolish Palestinian structures built without a permit,' revived the case, filing an amicus curiae request, at which the state of Israel then submitted a full reply to the Zanuta villagers' petition. As one of a dozen villages in the South Hebron Hills, Zanuta has been slated for demolition by the IDF, and the villagers are to be expelled from Area C of the West Bank to areas under Palestinian authority (Area A or Area B). The Israeli civil administration claims that the demolition order is related to the fact that it lies directly over an archeological site recognized under the British mandate, and therefore regularisation of their village structures is ruled out. Archeologist Avi Ofer, who did his doctoral research on the area, has expressed astonishment at the extent of the area -120 dunams (30 acres), - defined as the \\"Zanuta archaeology site\\" by the Civil Administration. In his view the real site covers half or less that size. To The Guardian one shepherd stated: \\"We have no choice but to be here, this is how we were raised and this is how we live,\\"... \\"The only thing we know how to do is raise sheep. We can only do that here.‚ÄùPalestinian villages face demolition to create IDF training ground, Phoebe Greenwood, 24 July 2012, The Guardian According to Amira Hass, while calling for the demolition of Palestinian villages, Israeli authorities have approved construction in Jewish settlements on more imposing archaeological sites, such as the settlement at Tel Rumeida in Hebron, or in Jerusalem itself. The state declared that the military were not obliged to find a solution for the villagers, and demands that they be moved out to ad- Dhahiriya. In response to petitions by the villagers, the High Court has ruled that the state had 30 days to find a solution to the impasse either by providing permits or making appropriate arrangements for the villagers. On 29 August 2012 the Israeli governing authority in the West Bank destroyed two cisterns, some used to catch rainfall, used by Khirbet Zanuta shepherds and farmers. Three others were destroyed at nearby Khirbet Anizat. Together they lost five sheepfolds, two tents, a tin shack and two improvised food storage sheds. According to Khirbet Zanuta residents one of the cisterns was hundreds of years old.Amira Hass, IDF razes Palestinian infrastructure in West Bank communities at Haaretz, 30 August 2012. Some of the cisterns were created with the assistance of a Polish NGO.Amira Hass, 'Polish NGO safeguards Palestinian water rights,' at Haaretz 8 December 2012.

The fire quickly spread through the entire vessel.

An attempt was made to move the ship, by slipping the anchor chains, but the heat drove the crew back from the other. Finally it was cut through from the outside and towed ashore at Sandridge (Port Melbourne) by two tugs, Lioness and Sophia, and left to burn. The tugs Sophia and Hercules later towed the ship to the beach between Sandridge and Williamstown where she continued to smolder (UID 152).

Key persons in the organisation are Venerable Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara and Dilanthe Withanage. The BBS is a break-away organisation from the right-wing nationalist Jathika Hela Urumaya organisation. Organization Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara and Dilanthe Withanage are the General Secretary and Chief Executive Officer of BBS respectively. Its headquarters are located at Sri Sambuddha Jayanthi Mandira in Colombo. Sri Sambuddha Jayanthi Mandira is owned by the Buddhist Cultural Centre, an organisation also founded by former leader Kirama Wimalajothi. The Buddhist Cultural Centre was opened by President Mahinda Rajapaksa on 15 May 2011. The BBS alongside Ravana Balaya, Sinhala Ravaya and Mahasohon Balakaya are among a new wave of organisations in Sri Lanka that push a \\"new brand\\" of Nationalism with a greater emphasis of religion with more militant tendencies to protect the motherland. The organisation attracts support from \\"hot blooded\\" Monks and lower middle class youth. History The BBS was founded by monks Kirama Wimalajothi and Galagoda Aththe Gnanasaara after they broke away from Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU). Gnanasara had been one of the JHU candidates in Colombo District at the 2004 parliamentary election. One of the earliest campaigns by BBS was in respect of Buddhist Sri Lankans working in the Middle East who, according to BBS, were prevented from practising their religion and punished harshly if found to be doing so. The BBS held its first national convention at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall on 28 July 2012. The convention passed five resolutions which, amongst other things, called for a ban on vasectomy and tubal ligation in government health facilities, replacement of the various legal systems used in the country with a single legal system, preferential treatment in university admission for students who attended Buddhism classes, use of monks in government schools to teach history and other classes, and the avoidance of any race- or religion-based solution for the country's ethnic problems. The BBS held a protest at the Bangladeshi High Commission in Colombo on 4 October 2012 against the anti-Buddhist riots in Bangladesh. Some of the protesters threw stones and bottles at the High Commission. On 14 October 2012 BBS stormed a house in Batakettara, Homagama, Piliyandala where it alleges a Christian pastor called Dinesh and others from an evangelical group called The Name of Lord Jesus were trying to convert Sinhalese Buddhists. The pastor was later released, but seven people were arrested on charges of abduction after complaints were made by the pastor's family. The following day BBS held a protest outside Piliyandala Police Station demanding that the seven arrested be released. The BBS held a protest rally in Badulla on 25 October 2012 against alleged conversion, vandalism of Buddhist sites and Islamic terrorism. They held a protest at the Department of Archeology on 29 November 2012 urging the authorities to protect archaeological sites in the Eastern Province. The BBS stormed Sri Lanka Law College in Hultsdorf, Colombo on 7 January 2013, alleging that exam results were being distorted in favour of Muslim students. The allegations were not true but the college was forced to delay new student registration by one week in order to investigate the allegations. The BBS stormed the Cinnamon Bay Hotel in Moragalla, Beruwala on 21 January 2013, alleging that the premises contained a \\"Buddha bar\\" (associating sacred symbols with such places as bars is considered sacrilege). Two hotel managers were arrested by the police for organising the \\"Buddha bar\\" event. President Mahinda Rajapaksa and government ministers met with the BBS on 27 January 2013 at Temple Trees, Colombo. After the meeting the President issued a statement which urged the BBS and other monks to avoid conflicts with other religious communities but this statement was only issued in English, not Sinhala which is the language of most BBS supporters. The opposition United National Party met with the BBS on 12 February 2013. The BBS organised a meeting in Maharagama, Colombo on 17 February 2013 which was attended by around 16,000 people including 1,300 monks. At the rally the BBS general secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara stated \\"This is a government created by Sinhala Buddhists and it must remain Sinhala Buddhist. This is a Sinhala country, Sinhala government. Democratic and pluralistic values are killing the Sinhala race\\". He also told the crowd at the rally that they \\"must become an unofficial civilian police force against Muslim extremism. These so-called democrats are destroying the Sinhala race\\". At the rally the BBS unveiled the \\"Maharagama Declaration\\", a ten-point resolution which, other than an end to halal certification, called for a ban on Sri Lankan women going to work in the Middle East; end of mosque building financed by the Middle East; and ban some contraceptives. In February 2013 former BBS leader Kirama Wimalajothi called for a ban on burqas in the country. The BBS has also campaigned against the abaya. The BBS met Lieutenant General Jagath Jayasuriya, Major General Shavendra Silva and others from the Sri Lanka Army in late February 2013 to discuss extremist Muslim groups that the BBS alleged were operating in the country. BBS also met with IGP N. K. Illangakoon from the police on 1 March 2013 to discuss the same issues. Meth Sevana, the BBS's cultural and training centre in Pilana, Wanchawala, Galle District, was officially opened on 9 March 2013 by chief guest Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, brother of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The BBS held a rally in Kandy on 17 March 2013 at which it announced that it would work to remove a 10th-century mosque at the Kuragala Buddhist monastery complex in Ratnapura District. At the rally BBS alleged that Muslim fundamentalists had taken over the site and destroyed Buddhist heritage. BBS general secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara accused the Muslim owned Fashion Bug and No Limit retail chains of converting its Buddhist Sinhalese employees to Islam. The BBS held a rally in Panadura on 24 March 2013 at which it called on the country to rally against Christian and Muslim extremists, insisting Sri Lanka was a Sinhala Buddhist country, not a multiracial or multi-religious country. At the rally BBS called for High Commissioner Ferial Ashraff to be recalled from Singapore for allegedly carrying out anti-Sinhala activities. At the rally BBS announced that a ringtone could be downloaded from Mobitel, the state-owned mobile phone operator, which would raise funds for BBS. This caused protests from Mobitel customers and the company was forced to apologise for causing \\"emotional distress\\". A nationwide protest by Muslims against the BBS and JHU was held on 25 March 2013. The protests were organised by the Muslim Rights Organization (MRO). A hartal was observed in the Eastern Province on the same day against the BBS's anti-Muslim stance. The Muslim owned Fashion Bug clothes shop in Pepiliyana, Colombo District was attacked on 28 March 2013 by a mob led by Buddhist monks. Some reports suggested that BBS was behind the attack. BBS denied any involvement and condemned the attack. On 31 March 2013 it was reported that the government was going to ban a number of groups including the BBS. Reacting to the reports, BBS general secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara described Minister of National Languages and Social Integration Vasudeva Nanayakkara as a disgrace and a peacenik, saying \\"Such ministers should be sent to Angoda once in three months, to have their heads examined\\". Nanayakkara denied the reports, saying that the government was not going to ban extremist groups like the BBS, it was only considering banning hate speech. In April 2013 a group of BBS members led by general secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara visited the US to raise awareness of the organisation and counter its negative image. In August 2014 Gnanasara Thera criticised the Government for allowing the Sri Lanka Thowheed Jamath (SLTJ) to carry out protests against Israel due to the ongoing Gaza war. The Thera noted that Israel supplied a range of armaments, including Kfir jets, Dvora and Shaldag class fast attack craft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, anti-missile systems for Mi-24 helicopter gunships as well as combat training. In 2014, Gnanasara Thera and the BBS signed a pact with Myanmar's Ashin Wirathu and the 969 Movement to build a Buddhist Alliance in order to protect the Buddha Sasana. They also invited all \\"peace loving people\\" from other religions, including Muslims and Christians. However Wirathu and the 696 Movement is accused of being key figures in Myanmar's anti-Muslim riots and massacres. The President of the Hindu Federation N. Arunakanth was also present and stated that they were in discussions with several Indian Hindu organisations as well. In 2019, Gnanasara Thera and the BBS joined the islandwide protests by various organisations and religious leaders led by the fasting protest of Athuraliye Rathana Thera against Muslim minister Rishad Bathiudeen and governors Azath Salley and M. L. A. M Hizbullah over their alleged ties to Islamists, demanding their resignations . On the same day All of Sri Lanka's Muslim ministers and their deputies resigned from their portfolios for a month and asked the allegations to be proven within that time. Until they return their ministries would be handled by the PM. However Gnanasara later criticised Rathana Thera for taking issues into his own hands which according to him swept the \\"main issues\\" under the carpet. He also noted that the protest should have been held earlier in the immediate aftermath of the 2019 Easter Bombings and doing it now could push the traditional Muslims into extremism.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/sri-lanka-muslim-ministers- quit-protest-threat- community-190603083758991.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/world/asia/sri- lanka-muslim-ministers-resign.html  Halal certification issue  ACJU halal logo In February 2013 the BBS started a campaign against the halal certifying system in the country. In Sri Lanka, halal certification is carried out by the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU), the group of Islamic clerics, to Sri Lanka. Certificates are only issued to businesses that request it, and the certificate is issued for a fee where the contributions are used by the ACJU to fund Islamic religious activities. The BBS initially threatened to take the ACJU to court. Later they threatened to launch a campaign of agitation against halal certification, stating \\"they [the Muslims] are trying to impose their ritualistic food products upon this country. The next plan is to bring about Sharia law. Already there is Muslim banking system in the country.\\" At the rally in Maharagama on 17 February 2013 the BBS announced that it was calling for the abolition of the halal certifying system, demanding that shops be cleared of halal meat by April. In late February 2013 the ACJU offered to hand over responsibility for halal certifying to the government but this was rejected by the BBS who called for the complete eradication halal certification in the country. The BBS slammed the ACJU as \\"arrogant, corrupt, thieving, underworld thugs\\". The government also refused to take over halal certification due to the pressure exerted by the BBS. The BBS stormed a meat inspection facility in Dematagoda run by Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) on 1 March 2013, alleging that young calves, pregnant cows and water buffaloes were being slaughtered at the premises. The slaughter of calves is illegal in Colombo. The BBS were incorrect ‚Äì the premises were being used by CMC officials to inspect meat prior to being distributed around the city. Meetings were held between the ACJU, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) and Buddhist clergy and a compromise was announced on 11 March 2013. The ACJU would stop adding the halal logo on products for local consumption but continue to use them for products being exported to Islamic countries where it is compulsory. This offer was also rejected on 12 March 2013 by the BBS who continued to demand \\"the eradication of the entire Halal process\\". The BBS went on to attack those responsible for the compromise. They accused Milinda Moragoda, a government minister, of \\"creating an unholy inter-religious alliance, and attempting to destroy our learned monks. These revered bhikkus are now in the grasp of infidels\\". They branded the Buddhist clergy as \\"pseudo Buddhist leaders who never stood against Muslim extremism and Christian fundamentalism.\\" They accused the CCC chairman Susantha Ratnayake of having a \\"Buddha bar\\" at a hotel he runs. The government pronounced on 13 March 2013 that the ACJU had no power to issue halal certificates and that a new way to certify halal products would need to be formulated. On 17 March 2013 the BBS declared victory in its battle against halal, saying it would not talk about halal in the future. 2014 anti-Muslim riots On Poson Poya (12 June 2014) Buddhist monk Ayagama Samitha and his driver were allegedly assaulted by Muslims in Dharga Town. A mob from Samitha's temple, together with the priest, stormed Aluthgama Police Station demanding that immediate action be taken. Three Muslims were arrested and remanded until 25 June 2014 by the courts. That evening a tense situation arose in Aluthgama as a group of Sinhalese Buddhists started protesting against the alleged assault. The protest turned violent and the mob started throwing stones at the police and attacking Muslim shops. Three people were arrested over the violence. On 15 June 2014 the BBS staged rallies in Aluthgama, Beruwala and Dharga Town in Kalutara District. Addressing a cheering crowd in Aluthgama, BBS leader Galagoda Aththe Gnanasaara threatened \\"In this country we still have a \\"Sinhala police\\"; we still have a \\"Sinhala army\\". After today if a single Marakkalaya [Muslim, in context used derogatorily] or some other paraya [alien, outcast, also a derogatory term] touches a single Sinhalese‚Ä¶..it will be their end.\\" After its rally the BBS drove into Dharga Town chanting anti-Muslim slogans. Reportedly local Muslim residents started throwing stones at the BBS convoy which resulted in violent clashes erupting between the two groups. Eyewitnesses reported Muslim homes and a mosque being stoned. Muslims were pulled off buses and assaulted whilst the Buddhist mob threw Molotov cocktails, burning and looting Muslim shops and homes. Muslim residents were forced to flee from their homes and seek shelter in mosques and community centres. There was rioting in Beruwala as well. At least four people were killed and 80 injured. Hundreds were made homeless following attacks on homes, shops, factories, mosques and a nursery. 10,000 people (8,000 Muslims and 2,000 Sinhalese) were displaced by the riots. The BBS was widely blamed for inciting the riots but it has denied responsibility. Attacks on media The BBS general secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara has accused the majority of the English language media in the country of \\"working on foreign agendas\\" and of being \\"kalu suddho\\" (traitors) to the Sinhala Buddhist cause. A BBC News crew filming the BBS rally at Maharagama on 17 February 2013 were surrounded by a mob of twenty young men who threatened them and verbally abused a Sri Lankan member of the crew, accusing him of being a \\"traitor\\", having \\"foreign parents\\" and working for a \\"foreign conspirator\\" who was \\"against Sri Lanka\\". The police seemed to be helping the crew by barricading the crew and ordering them not to leave. The mob threatened it would \\"be the end\\" of the crew if they returned to Maharagama. A reporter from the Muslim newspaper Navamini was also harassed at the rally by a mob who handed him over to the police who in turn detained the reporter for} hours. Criticism and controversies The BBS has received criticism from politicians, human rights groups, other Buddhist clergy and Muslims from Sri Lanka and abroad. Bodu Bala Sena has drawn criticism from notable representatives of every political party which represent the Sri Lankan parliament except Jathika Hela Urumaya, a Sinhala nationalist political party, for its ideology and actions. Some believe BBS is a front group for Western countries who wish to divide the Sri Lankan population in order to serve western interests. For example, Wimal Weerawansa, a Sri Lankan government minister, has asked that BBS challenge \\"the Norway agent in its organization\\" in response to BBS's challenge to him to prove BBS has received funds from a Norwegian NGO. Minister of National Languages and Social Integration Vasudeva Nanayakkara has described BBS as \\"an extremist group that comes up with provoking statements\\". Opposition MP and former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera has accused the BBS of being \\"a representation of ‚ÄòTaliban‚Äô terrorism‚Äô\\" and of spreading extremism and communal hatred against Muslims. Samaraweera has also alleged that the BBS is secretly funded by the Ministry of Defence. The BBS demanded a public apology for Samaraweera's comments, calling him bankrupt and accusing him of supporting separatists. Former ambassador Dayan Jayatilleka has described the BBS as an \\"ethno- religious fascist movement from the dark underside of Sinhala society\\". Vikramabahu Karunaratne, leader of the Nava Sama Samaja Party, has labelled the BBS as an extremist religious group. The International Crisis Group has stated that the BBS's attacks on the Muslim community will lead to an increase in Islamic fundamentalism in the country. The Islamic Human Rights Commission has accused the BBS of \\"spreading religious hatred\\" and urged the Sri Lankan government to take legal action against organisations which attack minority groups. The Asian Human Rights Commission has described the BBS as an \\"expression of the widespread lawlessness in the country\\", claiming that the government's failure to take action against groups such as the BBS demonstrated the government's connivance. Minority Rights Group International has accused BBS of being the main group behind the recent spate of attacks against Muslims in the country. In its 2012 human rights report, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office accused BBS of increasing \\"campaigns against religious minorities\\". The views of the BBS have been disowned by some of the mainstream Buddhist clergy. Anunayake Bellanwila Wimalaratana has stated that \\"The views of the Bodu Bala Sena are not the views of the entire Sangha community\\". Opposition provincial councillor and MRO president Mujeebur Rahuman has stated that the unfettered activities of the BBS will mean an \\"ethnic riot will start between Sinhalese and Muslims\\". The Eastern Provincial Council passed a motion unanimously on 20 February 2013 censuring the BBS for its anti-Muslim stance. Kalmunai Municipal Council passed a motion on 4 April 2013 against extremist groups including the BBS, urging crackdown on these groups. A group calling itself \\"Buddhists Questioning Bodu Bala Sena\\" staged a peaceful candle-lit vigil on 12 April 2013 outside the BBS's headquarters at Sri Sambuddha Jayanthi Mandira. The vigil was broken up by the police. In July 2014, Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara, the secretary general of the group, demanded that Pope Francis apologize to the Buddhists of Sri Lanka for various \\"atrocities committed by Christian colonial governments in South Asia\\" after it was announced that he would visit Sri Lanka in January 2015.Yahoo News by the Associated Press: Sri Lanka Buddhists want Pope Francis to apologize After Gnanasara made this demand, a group of Buddhists stormed a meeting at Centre for Society and Religion in Colombo. In doing so they disrupted a meeting over the search for people missing from the civil war and began hurling insults and threats to destroy the center. On 22 July 2014, Gnanasara denounced the 14th Dalai Lama after he called for the Buddhist monks in Myanmar and Sri Lanka to end violence towards Muslims in their countries. He asserted that they did not recognize the Dalai Lama as the leader of Buddhists worldwide and stated that the Dalai Lama was being fed false information from Muslim extremists.Al Jazeera: Sri Lanka hardline monk denounces Dalai Lama Bodu Bala Sena was accused and criticised by the critics and other political leaders for aggravating the violence between Muslims and Buddhists in the country which troubled the entire nation in recent times including the 2018 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka in Kandy.

The ranch is a significant example of an operating Montana ranch, and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its prominence in local history and its character as a ranching operation. History Thexton had been born in England in 1824, and emigrated to the United States in 1855 with his wife Nancy Redhead Thexton. They settled in Grant County, Wisconsin, where Thexton took up his trade as a blacksmith. George remained there until 1864, when he left his family in Wisconsin and went to seek his fortune in the Alder Gulch goldfields of Montana, taking his tools with him. Having seen an opportunity to establish a business in Montana, he returned to Wisconsin to fetch his wife and four children. By the time they had reached Montana in 1867 there were five children. Thexton opened a blacksmith shop in Virginia City. In 1871 he established the Star Livery stable. By the next year he was able to buy his first on the Madison from Charles Johnson. George continued to manage his businesses in Virginia City, building a stone house there in 1884. By 1888 his wife and his two oldest sons had died, and George moved to the ranch with his surviving son Thomas, his daughter Annie, and his niece Agnes Whalley. George Thexton lived on the ranch until his death in 1904. Thomas Thexton had helped his father and had operated a cartage business hauling freight around Madison County. Thomas concentrated on building up herds of shorthorn cattle and horse after he moved to the ranch. He married Mary Ann Foreman in 1899. In 1910 Thomas hired a carpenter to build a new house which was completed in 1912, and expanded the ranch to more than 500 acres. Thomas died in 1929 and his wife and sons operated the ranch. Tom Thexton moved into the original ranch log ranch house while his mother, sisters and brothers lived in the newer stone house. The ranch prospered during World War II. By 1977, when Don and Tom Thexton sold the ranch, it had expanded to comprise , with an additional of leased land. The log ranch house was torn down. The ranch continues as an active cattle ranch. Description The ranch headquarters is located on a bench along Blaine Spring Creek, near the Madison River about to the east. The chief structure is the 1910-1912 ranch house, built by Jake Bauer. The house is a two-story cast-in-place concrete building with a hipped pyramidal roof. Large stones have been cast into the walls. There are two enclosed porches. A one-story log bunkhouse is located behind the main house, with two rooms, one storage and the other a room for a hired hand. The two -story log barn is to the south of the bunkhouse. It is believed to have been built before 1912. A root cellar, also built before 1912 is to the north of the barn. The by log granary remains as well. A hay road runs from the barn, past the granary and down to a ford on Blaine Spring Creek, running in a coulee down to the hay fields in the stream valley. Present The original Thexton Ranch is part of the north unit of the Alton Ranch. The Thexton Ranch was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 12, 2006.

Spontaneous bruising of the earlobes is considered characteristic of this condition, but lesions can present anywhere on the body.  Description  = Levamisole = Levamisole, a levo rotatory isomer of imidazothiazole, was previously approved as an antihelminthic and immunomodulator. It experienced some usage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but was primarily used for the treatment of parasitic infections. It was withdrawn from the U.S. market in early 2000 because of adverse health events. However, it is still approved in the United States as an antihelminthic agent in veterinary medicine. = Levamisole toxicity in cocaine supply = Levamisole has become a common additive to illicit cocaine. It is thought to intensify the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù by releasing dopamine in the brain, acts as a bulking agent, and is a difficult adulterant to recognize. Potential risks of levamisole-laced cocaine include neutropenia, agranulocytosis, arthralgias, retiform purpura, skin necrosis, and fever. The skin necrosis associated with levamisole toxicity ranges from leukocytoclastic vasculitis to occlusive vasculopathy. Several cases of severe agranulocytosis associated with cocaine use have been reported since 2006. With the recently recognized dermal disease, the face and ears are commonly affected, especially the bilateral helices and cheeks. However, there have also been case reports of involvement of the abdomen, chest, lower buttocks and legs.  Diagnosis  = Initial case report = LINES was first described in a 54-year-old male with history of hypothyroidism who presented to an urgent care facility with bilateral axillary adenopathy and severe malaise. Incision and drainage of the nodes was performed and he was discharged home with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for presumed Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The patient subsequently developed a temperature of 37.5¬∞C, expressed rigors, and night sweats. He returned to the ED the next day and on further history admitted to 3 weeks of ‚Äúsnorting 6-8 lines of coke a day‚Äù and smoking marijuana every evening to ‚Äúcome down.‚Äù He was hospitalized and treated with cefepime, doxycycline, and fluconazole empirically. The next day erythematous painful papules appeared on his trunk, arms, face, and ears. Blood cultures were negative. There was prominent necrosis of the malar region, nose, and lips with complete sparing of the back. Skin biopsy revealed extensive small vessel thrombosis throughout the superficial and deep dermal plexuses with perivascular mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and a few neutrophils surrounding the vessels. ESR was elevated at 35 mm/hour; cardiolipin IgM was weakly positive at 16.3;C4 was decreased at 10 mg/dl; antinuclear antibodies were negative and p-ANCA was reactive. Coagulation studies were within normal limits. There was an elevated d-dimer of 17.54 mg/mL and platelets were slightly decreased. The patient‚Äôs urine drug screen was positive for cannabis but not cocaine. Treatment Methylprednisolone was started and wound care was initiated. Epidermal necrosis then evolved to myonecrosis extending from midthigh to the foot which necessitated below knee amputation of the right extremity. The patient also required allografts to his chest and abdomen and autografts to his face and left lower extremity.  History  In 2011 a team of physicians from University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine in Tampa, FL (under the attending service of John T. Sinnott, MD FACP) recognized an association of skin necrosis with use of levamisole adulterated cocaine. The mnemonic LINES (Levamisole-Induced NEcrosis Syndrome) was coined to name the syndrome because the name was descriptive, reminds one of a ‚Äúline‚Äù of cocaine, and is easily remembered. Thus it is self exemplifying.

While the children were having an outdoor teddy bear picnic, the attacker, 32-year-old Horrett Irving Campbell, leapt over a fence and began attacking the children and adults with a machete. Three children and four adults were injured in the attack. The attack Shortly after 15:00 on 8 July 1996, parents and teachers at St Luke's School were organising a teddy bear picnic to celebrate the end of the school term. A man described as being in his mid-30s with a slight build whom parents had seen hanging around the bushes prior to the attack, jumped over a fence surrounding the children's play area and pulled out a large machete. As parents attempted to distract and stop the attacker, he calmly began slashing the machete indiscriminately at the adults and children. Three children and four adults, most notably Lisa Potts, were injured in the attack. Potts was a 21-year-old teacher at the school who suffered cuts to her head, back, arms, and one of her arms was almost severed in the attack. A parent chased the man out of the area towards a housing area known as Villiers Flats. Police surrounded the area, and approximately two hours later took away a man who turned out to be someone other than the assailant. The following day, after hours of searching the area, police arrested 32-year-old Horrett Irving Campbell in connection with the attack. Perpetrator Campbell was a 32-year-old man who lived across from St Luke' School in the nearby flats. Neighbours reported that he was unemployed and spent much of his time fixing his Volvo. He had previously been arrested for appearing in public with a machete strapped to his leg, but was not considered to be dangerous. At his trial, psychiatrist James Collins testified that Campbell was a schizophrenic who believed that the children were talking about him, and that the parents of the children had given information to the police about him. Campbell was also under the delusion that performing this attack would help rid him of a ghost which had haunted him for years. On 7 March 1997, judge Justice Sedley sent Campbell to a mental hospital for an indefinite period. Aftermath Potts underwent several surgeries to repair the damage suffered in the attack, and received an initial award of ¬£49,000 by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel, which was increased on 10 November 2001 to ¬£68,000. An award from the panel to the children was eventually increased from ¬£750 to ¬£20,000 each. Potts received the George Medal from Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 for her actions in defending the children.

Mister Loveless went through many line-up changes, with Rob I. Miller (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Charlie Koliha (bass guitar) being the only members present through all incarnations. Mister Loveless was named one of the Top 20 Bay Area Bands of 2011 by San Francisco Bay Area modern rock radio station Live 105. The band performed alongside noteworthy acts such as Black Francis, The Wedding Present, Beach Fossils, and Thee Oh Sees. History =Formation= Miller and Koliha formed Mister Loveless in high school with several friends. Koliha taught Miller how to play guitar, and Miller began writing songs instantly. When high school friends left for college, Miller and Koliha recruited Ed Melendez to play drums.http://www.misterloveless.com/?p=589 Sean Gaffney began playing lead guitar based on a particularly intense performance he had given during a high school talent show. Melendez was eventually replaced with drummer Rachael Travers. The band is named after Miller's memorably-named sixth grade teacher. =Early Work= Mister Loveless self-released and self-distributed its debut album, My Share of Losing, in 2004. The Two Words EP, comprising re-recorded versions of songs that had been released on a San Francisco local bands compilation album, Rose Hill Volume I, was recorded at Different Fur Studios. The EP accompanied the launch of Mister Loveless' own label, Shady Glen Records. The music from Two Words found its way into various skateboarding and snowboarding films, including Corey Duffel's Strange Notes. Shortly after the release of Two Words, Mister Loveless returned to Different Fur studios with Duane Ramos to record ‚ÄúIn Wonder‚Äù, a nearly six-minute-long song the band wanted to do a unique release for. This was released as a 7\\" single, with \\"June\\" as the B-side and \\"No One Knows\\" as a free download included with the purchase of the record. \\"In Wonder\\" was used in the end credits of Transworld Skateboarding film Right Foot Forward. (9) This earned the band more support from the skateboarding community and landed it other placement opportunities with Transworld Surf, Transworld Snow, and Skullcandy Headphones. =Three Words EP= Following the success of \\"In Wonder\\" and Two Words, Mister Loveless recruited Nick Clark to play drums, who debuted with the band in July 2009. The band also began writing material for their Three Words EP. The Three Words EP was a turning point for the group. It was a follow-up to Two Words in a sense, because it elaborated on using the number of words in the titles of the songs as a concept. However, it also represented a stylistic shift in production and songwriting. The singles ‚ÄúThe Old Pain,\\" ‚ÄúFrom Burning Bridges‚Äù and ‚ÄúStrange and Futureless‚Äù all charted on Specialty Radio. The EP earned favorable reviews from SF Weekly, Performer Magazine, and various other online music publications. =Grow Up and 2012-2013= With four releases and a handful of tours behind it, Mister Loveless began writing and recording its first full-length album. The band recruited Duane M. Ramos, with whom it had already worked on Three Words, to engineer and produce the album. This time, however, it was recorded entirely in Mister Loveless‚Äôs home studio/rehearsal space, Shady Glen Studios, located in Miller‚Äôs family‚Äôs garage in Walnut Creek. Additional mixing and production for the track \\"Wild Summer\\" was done by Matt Wallace. The result was the eleven-track album Grow Up, which was released on September 11, 2012. The band recorded a cover of \\"Blue Christmas\\" with Meghan Elizabeth in December 2012.http://survivingthegoldenage.com/mister-loveless-blue-christmas/ Daniel Brown replaced Gaffney on lead guitar in early 2013. During 2013, Mister Loveless released music videos for their songs \\"Punk Like Me\\" and \\"Curfew.\\" The band performed live at MacWorld 2013, SXSW 2013,http://www.withguitars.com/mister-loveless-is-performing-at-sxsw/ and BFD 2013.http://activate.metroactive.com/2013/03/live-105s-bfd-2013-lineup- revealed/ In August 2013, fellow Bay Area band, The Bilinda Butchers remixed \\"Curfew.\\"http://www.soundsbetterwithreverb.com/shoegaze/mister-loveless/ =Disbandment= On September 19, 2013, it was announced that bass player Charlie Kolhia had decided to leave the band. Miller made the decision to end the band entirely, writing, \\"I can‚Äôt do Mister Loveless without Charlie. However, I would be lying if I said I hadn‚Äôt begun to feel as though I had outgrown Mister Loveless as well. This band has become like an old jacket. I love it but, it just doesn‚Äôt fit right anymore.\\" The group announced their break-up through their Facebook page and a post on their website. Musical Style Mister Loveless incorporated elements of late 1970s post-punk, pioneered by groups such as Joy Division, and late 1980s/early 1990s guitar- heavy rock music synonymous with bands like Pixies and Sonic Youth. The group used a collaborative approach to write its songs, while singer/guitarist Rob Miller wrote the lyrics and vocal melodies. The lyrical content in the band‚Äôs songs ranged from forever aging and remembering more youthful days to anxiety- ridden existential crises crippled by indecisiveness.

Biography =Early life= Born in 1880 in the region of Pyong Aang Nam- Do, Korea, Lim received 7‚Äì8 years of education before leaving school in 1900. Three years later, at the age of 23, Lim traveled to Oahu, Hawaii to work as a labourer. In Hawaii he worked on a plantation and educated himself in his spare time. It was during this period that Lim developed nationalistic sentiments. By 1904, Lim had moved to San Francisco where he began learning English formally. While a student, he met Ahn Chang-ho, a Korean independence activist and one of the early leaders of the Korean-American immigrant community in the United States. =Participation of the Korean Independence movement in the US= At the end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan invaded and colonized Korea. Horrified that their country's sovereignty was under threat, Lim, Ahn, and other like-minded Koreans formed a group which later became the New People's Association, a clandestine organization whose aim was to foster the independence and national strength of the Korean Empire, by promoting national feeling among Koreans and Korean-Americans living in America. The New People's Association also served as the unofficial Korean consulate in America while Korea was under Japanese rule. In November 1905, Korea was pressured into signing the Eulsa Treaty, which handed full control of the Korean peninsula to Japan. Following this, Lim and others formed a nationalist newspaper called Gong-lib Shinbo, of which Lim was chief administrator, to campaign for their country and to promote national pride. Japan viewed the activities of Lim's organisations with disfavour, but were unable to take any action on American soil. Lim was also a leader in Shinminhoe, a Korean-American immigrant community group (Ïã†ÎØºÌöå), and served as secretary for The Korea Daily News [ÎåÄÌïúÎß§ÏùºÏã†Î≥¥(Â§ßÈüìÊØèÊó•Áî≥Â†±)]. Korean Independence Movement In 1906, Ahn Chang-ho returned to Korea, bringing the New People's Association with him. Lim followed in 1907. They established bases in first in Pyongyang and Seoul, then nationwide. They supported education, industrialization, and military action for independence. :105-Man Incident  In 1910, Lim was implicated after an attempt was made to assassinate Masatake Terauchi, the Governor-General of Korea (Ch√¥sen S√¥toku). A young Korean man named An Myeong-Gun, was alleged to have attempted to shoot Terauchi at Suncheon Station. An was a cousin of An Jung-geun buddah, a Korean independence activist who assassinated It≈ç Hirobumi (‰ºäËó§ÂçöÊñá), the first Prime Minister of Japan and then-Japanese Resident-General of Korea in 1906. The event would later become known as the Suncheon Incident or the 105 Man Incidents. After the failed attempt, the Governor-General arrested over 700 Koreans. In 1912, 122 were tried, and 105 sentenced to imprisonment with hard labor. In the end, only six Koreans had their sentences imposed, and even they were amnestied in 1915. It has been claimed that the plot was fabricated by the Japanese authorities to weaken and discredit the Korean independence movement. Certainly, after the failed attempt to assassinate Terauchi, the New People's Association came under close scrutiny. After Lim and other key members of the New People's Association were captured, the organization was disbanded. March 1st Movement In February 1919, after two Korean independence fighters - Jung Shung Kyong and Lee Sung Hun ‚Äì were jailed, Lim and other members of the New People's Association set about planning a mass protest against Japanese occupation. The March 1st Movement, or Samil Movement, was one of the earliest public displays of Korean resistance during the Japanese occupation of Korea. On March 1, 1919, Lim's comrades began their four-week-long protest in Nampho, North Korea. The campaign was violent and many of the protesters were jailed, but there was a major shift in Japanese imperial policy towards Korea. Although Lim was not directly involved in the protest, he was recognized as one of its architects. Death and legacy In 1923, in order to continue the Korean Independence Movement, Lim and his fellow activists established another nationalist newspaper Shi Dae Ilbo. Lim retired in 1928 and the newspaper stopped publishing due to internal conflicts and pressure from the Japanese. Lim's dedication to the Korean Independence Movement had begun to take a toll on his health. He became distressed by Japan's stranglehold over his country, and the inability of the Korean Independence Movement to loosen it. He turned to alcohol as a way of coping with the pain and stress. On January 100, 1932, Lim died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Seodaemun, Seoul. In 1968, the Korean government officially recognized Lim's efforts for the Korean Independence Movement by awarding him with the Order of Merit for National Foundation in the grade of Dongnip Jang (ÎèÖÎ¶ΩÏû•; \\"Order of Independence\\"). In January 2007, Korea's Ministry of Patriots' and Veterans' Affairs, (South Korea) further recognized Lim's achievement by presenting him as an .

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator and Senate Majority Leader Ernest McFarland ran for re-election to a third term, but was defeated by the Republican nominee and future candidate for President of the United States, Barry Goldwater. Goldwater ran an aggressive campaign against the entrenched Democrat, accumulating over fifty thousand air-miles in his travels about the state, during which he delivered more than six hundred speeches. He defeated McFarland in the general election by a slim margin of 6,725 votes out of approximately 260,000 cast, which Goldwater attributed in part to the unpopularity of President Harry S. Truman and the backing of popular Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy. Goldwater also launched a get out the vote effort in the northern part of the state, knowing the margin of victory would be slim, and received support from Republican Party campaign organizations and several prominent party members. The election marked the end of the Senate career of Ernest McFarland, who was first elected in 1940 and had served as co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Navajo-Hopi Indian Administration in addition to Senate Majority Leader. He was later elected Governor of Arizona in 1954 and ran unsuccessfully for his former Senate seat in 1958. Candidates =Democratic= *Ernest McFarland, incumbent U.S. Senator =Republican= *Barry Goldwater, Phoenix City Councilman Campaign After becoming a member of the Phoenix City Council in 1949, Barry Goldwater assumed a position as campaign manager of fellow Republican John Howard Pyle's successful 1950 bid for Governor of Arizona. After Pyle's narrow victory in the 1950 election, Goldwater began exploring the possibility of running for higher office himself and won re-election to his seat on the Phoenix Council by a comfortable margin. Goldwater's interest compounded in 1951, the same year he won re- election to his council seat, when Illinois U.S. Senator Everett Dirksen visited Phoenix. Goldwater, while at a cocktail party for Dirksen, was approached by the Illinois Senator, who encouraged him to run for Incumbent Democratic Senator Ernest McFarland's seat. Goldwater said later that he had estimated his chances at winning the election to be fifteen-to-one. Nonetheless, Goldwater began conducting research on McFarland and studied the election returns of Howard Pyle's 1950 gubernatorial victory, leading him to re-estimate his chances to be fifty-fifty. Goldwater had been campaigning for several months before formally announcing his candidacy for McFarland's U.S. Senate seat on April 24, 1952. In his formal announcement, Goldwater cited six reasons for his entering the Senate race: his belief \\"that a life-long familiarity with the State of Arizona and its people and intensive study of the problems and needs of this region as a businessman and citizen qualifies me to represent efficiently our state in Washington,\\" his opposition to the expansion of the federal government and belief in states' rights, his opposition to the New Deal and Fair Deal programs, his belief that a U.S. Senator should not be \\"a mere rubber stamp for any administration,\\" and his opposition to the \\"present tragic trend toward the destruction of individual freedom.\\" The divisive race between Dwight Eisenhower and Robert A. Taft for the Republican nomination in the 1952 presidential race became cause for concern for state Republicans, Goldwater in particular. He confided to an associate of the Republican National Committee, Clarence Buddington Kelland, that he believed the Democrats were beginning to benefit from the \\"constant bickering\\" within the party. This, believed Goldwater, was the best-case scenario for the Democrats, including McFarland, who was hindered in his bid for re-election by the unpopularity of the Truman administration. Originally believing he could run a campaign on his own with relatively few resources, Goldwater hired a campaign manager in June 1952, Stephen Shadegg, who had previously worked on the campaign of Democratic U.S. Senator Carl Hayden. Goldwater also received financial and logistical help from the Republican National Committee and the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. Goldwater also received financial backing from prominent Republicans, including Sid Richardson and H. L. Hunt and easily defeated his sole opponent, Lester Kahl, in the Republican primary on September 8. Goldwater employed a general election strategy of focusing get out the vote efforts on the three northernmost counties of Arizona, inhabited primarily by the Navajo and Hopi Native American peoples. Feeling the margin would be close in the election results, Goldwater believed these efforts, especially efforts to organize a voter registration campaign in the northern counties, to be crucial for victory, writing to Everett Dirksen in May that \\"this might well be the margin of victory in this state.\\" Results On Election Day, November 4, 1952, Barry Goldwater defeated incumbent Ernest McFarland by a slim margin, winning by 6,725 out of approximately 260,000 votes cast, becoming the first Republican to win an Arizona U.S. Senate election since 1920. Goldwater, writing to Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, said of the results, \\"The election victory was not entirely a surprise, because we knew that McFarland, carrying the weight of Truman's mistakes around his neck, would have a difficult time winning, particularly in view of the fact that I had spent nearly all of my life campaigning for this job, whether I realized it or not.\\" See also *United States Senate elections, 1952 *List of United States Senators from Arizona *Electoral history of Barry Goldwater References Arizona 1952 Arizona ","title":"1952 United States Senate election in Arizona"},{"id":"36611677","text":"H√©ctor Tiz√≥n (October 21, 1929 ‚Äì July 30, 2012) was an Argentinian writer, journalist, lawyer, judge, politician, and diplomat.

He is the owner and director of Phnom Penh's Beehive Radio, which the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) described in 2012 as \\"one of Cambodia's few independent news outlets\\". He also acts as a political commentator for the station. Sonando has been imprisoned three times on charges related to his reporting: a 2003 arrest for \\"inciting riots\\", a 2005 arrest for defamation, and a 2012 arrest for insurrection. His twenty-year prison sentence for the latter was protested by human rights groups, and US President Barack Obama expressed concerns about the case in a meeting with Prime Minister Hun Sen. The sentence was overturned by an appeals court in March 2013, and Sonando was instead given a five-year suspended sentence on charges of causing civil unrest.  Biography  Mam Sonando was born on 13 February 1942 in a small district called Kampong Siem in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia. His father, Mam Soth, was a lawyer. His mother Eam Ouch was born in Battambang province. Sonando traveled to Paris in 1964 for school. He attended the Vaugirard State Technical College of Photography and Cinematography, in Paris, France, from 1969 to 1970. In 1973, he received a bachelor's degree with major in sociology and cinematography and audio visuals, at the Paris XV University. He left Cambodia again in 1975 to avoid the rule of the Khmer Rouge, remaining in France until 1993. That year, he returned to Cambodia and acquired a broadcasting license for a new station which he named Beehive Radio. He used the station to advertise a new political party, the Beehive Democratic Society Party, and stood in the 1998 parliamentary election. According to the Asia Times, his campaign only won him \\"a reputation as an eccentric, spouting Buddhist philosophy, pleas for democracy and a personal campaign for attention.\\" After failing to be elected, Sonando dissolved his party, but continued broadcasting on Beehive Radio as an independent journalist. Sonando is the owner and director of Beehive Radio. In 2012, Human Rights Watch described Beehive Radio as \\"a key platform for promotion of human rights and democracy in Cambodia\\". The station is one of the few to address controversial topics, including \\"Cambodian civil society, the fight against HIV/AIDS, maternal mortality and human trafficking, campaigns for women's rights and gender equality, political and economic transparency, equitable and sustainable development, labor rights, environmental protection, the rule of law, and electoral education and election monitoring.\\" It also carries programming by Radio Free Asia, Voice of America, the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, and Radio France Internationale. The station is funded by a combination of advertising and private donations. Some companies have declined to advertise with Beehive Radio due to its occasionally controversial reporting and political stances. Sonando also refuses to run advertisements for \\"vice\\" products, including cigarettes.  2003 arrest  In January 2003, riots broke out in Phnom Penh after a Cambodian newspaper incorrectly reported that a Thai actress had stated Angkor Wat properly belonged to Thailand. On 29 January, the Thai embassy was burned, and hundreds of Thai immigrants fled the country to avoid the violence. During the riots, a caller to Beehive Radio claimed incorrectly that Cambodian embassy officials were killed in Bangkok. On 31 January, Sonando was arrested and accused of \\"relaying false information\\", \\"inciting discrimination\\", and \\"inciting crime\\". He stated to reporters, \\"They blame me for broadcasting an opinion of a listener which turned out to be untrue. But if I have to go to jail to allow people to express their opinion I am happy.\\" Sonando was formally charged in court on 1 February; ten days later, he was released on bail. The charges never came to trial.  2005 arrest  Sonando was arrested again on 11 October 2005 after reporting on Prime Minister Hun Sen's treaty with Vietnam settling the two nations' border dispute; the report included a discussion with a French-based expert who criticized Hun Sen's concessions. Sonando was charged with \\"criminal defamation\\", \\"disseminating false information\\", and \\"incitement\\". On 3 November, he was denied bail. Sonando's arrest was criticized by the United Nations and the European Union. A coalition of 70 Cambodian civil society organizations also pushed for his release. CPJ condemned the arrest as part of a \\"broad crackdown on freedom of expression\\", and Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience. In late January 2006, Sonando was granted bail ahead of a visit by US Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill. Hun Sen described the release as a \\"gift\\" to the visitor. The charges against Sonando were dropped before the end of the month.  2012 arrest  Mam Sonando (center) in police custody. In mid-2012, Beehive Radio reported on an International Court of Justice complaint against Prime Minister Hun Sen blaming him for the 2010 Phnom Penh stampede, in which 347 people were killed. The report sparked a new series of disputes between Sonando and Hun Sen. On 26 June 2012, Hun Sen called for Sonando's arrest while Sonando was out of the country, accusing him of heading a separatist plot in Krati√© Province to break it away from the rest of the nation. From 15 to 17 May, the province had been the site of a protest against evictions for a new rubber plant that residents accused of \\"land grabbing\\". On the final day of the protests, soldiers opened fire on a crowd of families, killing a 14-year-old girl. Though Sonando returned during the 2012 ASEAN meeting, he was not arrested until 15 July, a few days after its end. Hun Sen accused Sonando of attempting to create a \\"state within a state\\", and Sonando was formally charged with \\"insurrection\\" and \\"inciting people to take up weapons against state\\". The charges carried a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. Secessionist charges were also brought against several community activists from the province. According to Ou Virak of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, Sonando was then imprisoned in a cell shared with 17 other people, leaving him \\"half a square meter [5 square feet] to sleep in\\". On 22 July, he was moved to a prison hospital on account of illness. Sonando's arrest quickly generated domestic and international criticism. A coalition of 22 Cambodian rights groups, known as the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee, called on the government to free Sonando \\"to save the country's reputation\\". Members of Beehive Radio and the Association of Democrats protested in front of Phnom Penh's royal palace on 23 July. CPJ called for Sonado's immediate release, stating that Hun Sen had \\"a well-worn history of leveling unsubstantiated anti-state charges against journalists to stifle criticism of the administration.\\" Human Rights Watch said that \\"Sonando's arrest on the heels of [US Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton's visit is a brazen signal that Hun Sen thinks that the US wants his cooperation on other matters so much that he isn't afraid to lower the boom on his critics\\". Amnesty International again named Sonando a prisoner of conscience, \\"held for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression\\". The International Federation for Human Rights and the World Organisation Against Torture issued a joint statement noting that they were \\"gravely concerned\\" about the charges and calling for Sonando's immediate release. Reporters Without Borders described the arrest as \\"like a parting slap to all those who attended last week's ASEAN summit in Phnom Penh. As soon the diplomats leave, the authorities arrest dissidents.\\" The Ireland-based NGO Front Line Defenders included him on the short list for its 2013 Human Rights Defender at Risk award. On 1 October 2012, Sonando was found guilty by a Phnom Penh court. He was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment and fined 10 million riel (US$2,500). In November, US President Barack Obama raised concerns about the case during a meeting with Hun Sen. French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault also called for Sonando to be released. An appeals court overturned Sonando's conviction on anti-state charges on 14 March 2013, finding that there had been no evidence to convict him. The court instead gave Sonando a five-year suspended sentence on charges that he had been involved in the Krati√© unrest. A crowd of hundreds of Sonando supporters gathered outside the courthouse to hear the verdict. Amnesty International called the ruling \\"a positive step for freedom of expression in the country\\", but added that \\"Mam Sonando should never have been imprisoned in the first place, and the convictions that stand appear baseless.\\" Sonando was released from prison on 15 March, the day after the ruling. Following his release, Sonando stated his intention to clear his name of the remaining charges. 2014 protest Beehive Radio protesters marching. In January 2014, Mam Sonando organized a mass demonstration, which demanded the government to expand his radio reach and open a TV station. The Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith denied the permission for the expansion but Mam Sonando told reporters the denial is unconstitutional. Protesters clashed with police on 28 January injuring at least 9 of the demonstrators. In response to the violence, Human Rights Watch calls for the United Nations to pressure the Cambodian government. Reporters Without Borders and Freedom House have also condemned the violence.  Personal life  Sonando is married to Den Phanara. He is a devout Buddhist who constructed a Buddhist temple beside his radio station, and is an avid fan of jazz. He is Soth Polin's brother-in-law.

While production and distribution of The Cluster's print edition is subsidized by Mercer's administration, the paper retains full editorial autonomy as a student publication under the University's bylaws, and receives no monetary subsidies for its digital products. Its staff is composed entirely of students, with the exception of a faculty advisor who serves in a consulting role. Origins Students started publishing The Cluster in 1920. The paper received its name from a book of hymns penned by Mercer University founder and prominent Baptist minister Jesse Mercer in 1810, entitled \\"Cluster of Spiritual Songs.\\" Former Cluster contributors include longtime Atlanta publisher Jack Tarver, former U.S. attorney general Griffin B. Bell, attorney and author Robert Steed, novelist and physician Ferrol Sams and Atlanta Journal-Constitution editor J. Reginald Murphy. For most of its history, The Cluster has been the only newspaper published by students of Mercer University. In 1971, a group of students began publishing \\"Mercer Today\\" as an alternative to The Cluster, but the operation folded in 1977. Controversies In October 2005, The Cluster ran an opinions piece and full-page advertisement in support of a pro-LGBT student organization's first annual \\"Coming Out Day\\". News of the event sparked a month-long dispute between University president R. Kirby Godsey and the Georgia Baptist Convention, eventually leading the religious group to sever its 170-year-old ties and multi-million dollar endowment to the University out of a concern that Mercer had, as a report by CNN put it, become \\"more liberal than its Southern Baptist roots\\". Since the split, Mercer has chosen to be no longer formally religiously affiliated. Present-day operations In 2011, The Cluster launched its online edition in an effort to broaden its reach to students and the surrounding community, appointing its first digital editor, Carl V. Lewis. In fall of 2011, the paper also added a new \\"Local\\" section in an additional push to broaden its geographic reach to the increasingly gentrified neighborhoods that compose the surrounding College Hill Corridor area. Despite its growing focus on its digital operations, The Cluster maintains an estimated print circulation of around 1,500 copies, which are distributed for free throughout the University's main campus as well as downtown Macon businesses, as well as an estimated 37,000 unique visitors online each month. In 2014, the Digital Library of Georgia, in coordination with Mercer's Tarver Library, took on an ambitious multi-year project to digitize every printed issue of The Cluster since its founding. As of July 2015, all issues of the newspapers from 1920 to 1970 are available for searching and viewing at http://mercercluster.galileo.usg.edu. In 2014, The Cluster's newsroom operations moved into the newly-constructed Center for Collaborative Journalism.

Cathy, Chick-fil-A's chief operating officer, related issues have arisen between the international fast food restaurant and LGBT people. This followed reports that Chick-fil-A's charitable endeavor, the S. Truett Cathy-operated WinShape Foundation, had donated millions of dollars to organizations seen by LGBT activists as hostile to LGBT rights. Activists called for protests and boycotts, while supporters of the restaurant chain, and opponents of same-sex marriage ate there in support of the restaurant. National political figures both for and against the actions spoke out and some business partners severed ties with the chain. The outcome of the initial controversy was mixed, as Chick-fil-A's sales rose twelve percent, to $4.6 billion, in the period immediately following the controversy; this was largely attributed to former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee's counter-boycott launched in support of the restaurant. However, the company's public image and standing with the LGBT community was damaged, with the chain facing criticism and condemnation from politicians and gay rights activists, as well as efforts by activists and political officials to ban the restaurant from college campuses, airports and elsewhere. Chick-fil-A released a statement in July 2012 stating, \\"Going forward, our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\\" In March 2014, tax filings for 2012 showed the group stopped funding all but one organization which had been previously criticized, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. In 2017, tax filings show that the number of groups supported by Chick-fil-A expanded to include The Salvation Army, which has been seen as counter to LGBTQ rights. In November 2019, Chick-fil-A announced that it was stopping its contributions to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and The Salvation Army. Chick-fil-A began funding Covenant House, a pro-LGBTQ charitable organization that concentrates on providing food and shelter to youth facing homelessness. History =Group contributions from opponents of LGBT causes= The WinShape Foundation, a charitable endeavor of Chick-fil-A founder S. Truett Cathy and his family, stated that it would not allow same-sex couples to participate in its marriage retreats. Chick-fil-A gave over $8 million to the WinShape Foundation in 2010. Equality Matters, an LGBT watchdog group, published reports of donations by WinShape to organizations that the watchdog group considers anti-gay, including $2 million in 2009, $1.9 million in 2010 and a total of $5 million since 2003, including grants to the Family Research Council and Georgia Family Council. WinShape contributed grants to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and Exodus International, an organization noted for supporting ex-gay conversion therapy. Protestors at a Memphis, Tennessee Chick-fil-A store on Same Sex Kiss DayThe Marriage and Family Foundation received $994,199 in 2009 and $1,188,380 in 2010. The Family Research Council, an organization listed as an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center in Winter 2010, Sources:  * received $1000. Sources:  In January 2011, the media reported that the American fast food restaurant chain Chick-fil-A was co-sponsoring a marriage conference along with the Pennsylvania Family Institute (PFI), an organization that had filed an amicus brief against striking down Proposition 8 in California (see Perry v. Brown). Sources:  * * The PFI lobbied against a state effort to ban discrimination in Pennsylvania on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Responding on its official company Facebook page, Chick-fil-A said that support of the PFI retreat had come from a local franchisee, stating \\"We have determined that one of our independent restaurant operators in Pennsylvania was asked to provide sandwiches to two Art of Marriage video seminars.\\" Tax filings for 2012 showed that Chick-fil-A created a new foundation, the Chick-fil-A Foundation, to provide grants to outside groups. It funded only one previously funded group, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Other filings for WinShape Foundation showed no funding for groups opposed to LGBT causes. =Statements by Dan Cathy= On June 16, 2012, while on the syndicated radio talk show, The Ken Coleman Show, Chick-fil-A president and chief operating officer (COO) Dan Cathy stated: The following month, on July 2, Biblical Recorder published an interview with Dan Cathy, who was asked about opposition to his company's \\"support of the traditional family.\\" He replied: \\"Well, guilty as charged.\\" Cathy continued: The day after the Supreme Court of the United States struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, Cathy tweeted, \\"Sad day for our nation; founding fathers would be ashamed of our gen. to abandon wisdom of the ages re: cornerstone of strong societies.\\" The tweet was subsequently deleted, but was archived by Topsy. In March 2014, Cathy said he regretted drawing his company into the controversy. \\"Chick-fil-A CEO seeks to get beyond gay marriage debate\\" , abpnews.com; accessed August 11, 2015. He told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution he has been working with Shane Windmeyer of Campus Pride since 2012. The article noted that WinShape and the Chick-fil-A Foundation had \\"dramatically\\" cut donations to groups opposed by same-sex marriage supporters. \\"Cathy Seeks to Put Gay Marriage Flap Behind Chick-fil-A\\" , myajc.com; accessed September 10, 2014 (subscription required) =Policy changes= In September 2012, The Civil Rights Agenda (TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A had \\"ceased donating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against LGBT civil rights\\". This change in policy was not confirmed by Chick-fil-A officials. Chick-fil-A officials did state in an internal document that they \\"will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation\\". In a letter from Chick-fil-A's Senior Director of Real Estate, the company states, \\"The WinShape Foundation is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas.\\" According to Focus on the Family website, CitizenLink.com: \\"Contrary to reports first made by the gay-activist group The Civil Rights Agenda (TCRA) on Tuesday and later picked up by mainstream media outlets, Chick-fil-A and its charitable- giving arm, the WinShape Foundation, did not agree to stop making donations to groups that support the biblical definition of marriage in exchange for being allowed to open a franchise in Chicago.\\" Former Arkansas Governor and FOX News commentator Mike Huckabee claimed on September 21, 2012 that he had \\"talked earlier today personally with Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick-fil-A about the new reports that Chick-fil-A had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same sex marriage. This is not true. The company continues to focus on the fair treatment of all of its customers and employees, but to end confusion gave me this statement.\\" The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on Huckabee's website but the company did not respond to requests for comment. Mike Huckabee: Chick-fil-A hasn't changed , politico.com; accessed September 14, 2014. In March 2014, new tax filings from 2012 showed that the company had stopped funding all but one organization which had been previously criticized by LGBT activists and supporters but, that group received just $25,390. The company created a new foundation, the Chick-fil-A Foundation, to fund outside groups. WinShape Foundation's 2012 tax filings showed funding only for its own programs, a Berry College scholarship fund, and Lars WinShape, a home for needy children in Brazil. In 2017, Chick-fil-A is warning all its franchisees against speaking out publicly or getting involved in anything that could blur the line between their private beliefs and their public roles as extensions of the Chick-fil-A brand, the company has said. In 2017, that message extended to politics, in part to keep the brand from being exploited by candidates. The company turned down several candidates who tried to use Chick-fil-A to bolster their campaigns, according to David Farmer, Chick-fil-A's vice president of menu strategy and development. \\"There are several candidates who would like to use us as a platform,\\" Farmer told Business Insider. \\"We are not engaging. Chick-fil-A is about food, and that's it. \\"The company still encourages its franchisees to get 'entrenched' in their communities...\\" Traditionally, that has meant getting involved in local churches. But although Chick-fil-A says its focus now ‚Äî both for local and corporate involvement and philanthropy ‚Äî is on youth and education causes, as of July 6, 2017, Chick-fil-A's associated foundation continued to donate over a million dollars a year to causes characterized as anti-gay. In an interview with Bisnow in 2019, Chick-fil-A President Tim Tassopoulos said the company will stop donating to charities with anti-LGBT views. The company will instead donate to charities focused on education, homelessness and hunger. These new organizations could include both faith-based and non-faith-based charities, but the company said none of the organizations have anti-LGBT positions. Controversy =United States government= On May 29, 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration's office of civil rights started an investigation on Buffalo Niagara International Airport and San Antonio International Airport for excluding Chick-fil-A from opening a restaurant in their airport because of the company's ‚Äúlong history of supporting and funding anti-LGBTQ organizations.‚Äù Citing \\"Federal requirements prohibit airport operators from excluding persons on the basis of religious creed from participating in airport activities that receive or benefit from FAA grant funding.\\" =Local government= After the publication of Cathy's interviews, Democrat Thomas Menino, the Mayor of Boston, stated that he would not allow the company to open franchises in the city \\"unless they open up their policies.\\" Menino subsequently wrote a letter to Dan Cathy, citing Cathy's earlier statement on The Ken Coleman Show, and responded: \\"We are indeed full of pride for our support of same sex marriage and our work to expand freedom for all people.\\" In Chicago, Democratic alderman Proco Joe Moreno announced his determination to block Chick-fil-A's bid to build a second store in the city: \\"They'd have to do a complete 180\\", Moreno said in outlining conditions under which he would retract the block. \\"They'd have to work with LGBT groups in terms of hiring, and there would have to be a public apology from [Cathy].\\" Moreno received backing from Chicago's Mayor, Rahm Emanuel: \\"Chick-fil-A values are not Chicago values\\", Emanuel said in a statement. \\"They disrespect our fellow neighbors and residents. This would be a bad investment, since it would be empty.\\" Also according to Moreno, Chick-fil-A included a statement of respect for all people regardless of sexual orientation in an internal document called Chick-fil-A: Who We Are. A document released by Chick-fil-A on September 20, 2012 did not mention any organizations opposed to same-sex marriage as being part of Chick-fil-A's donation base. WinShape Marriage will continue to be supported financially, with a stated focus on couple retreats to strengthen marriages. San Francisco soon followed suit on July 26, 2012 when mayor Democrat Edwin M. Lee tweeted, \\"Very disappointed #ChickFilA doesn't share San Francisco's values & strong commitment to equality for everyone.\\" Lee followed that tweet with \\"Closest #ChickFilA to San Francisco is 40 miles away & I strongly recommend that they not try to come any closer.\\" The proposed bans in Boston and Chicago drew criticism from some liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Kevin Drum of Mother Jones magazine said \\"[T]here's really no excuse for Emanuel's and Menino's actions... you don't hand out business licenses based on whether you agree with the political views of the executives. Not in America, anyway ... what makes this whole situation so weird is that Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy has always opposed gay marriage. He's a devout Southern Baptist, just like his father, who founded the company. The place is closed on Sundays, for crying out loud. There's just nothing new here.\\" UCLA law professor and blogger Eugene Volokh observed, \\"[D]enying a private business permits because of such speech by its owner is a blatant First Amendment violation.\\" Echoing those views were Glenn Greenwald of Salon, professor John Turley of The George Washington University Law School, Adam Schwartz, a senior attorney with the ACLU, and Michael C. Dorf, the Robert S. Stevens Professor of Law at Cornell University Law School. In March 2019, Texas‚Äô attorney general, Ken Paxton, opened an investigation after the city of San Antonio decided to reject the application for Chick-fil-A to open a store at San Antonio International Airport because of the company's stand on LGBT issues. Paxton said that the ban was \\"the opposite of tolerance\\" and a \\"discriminatory decision\\" based on the religious beliefs of the chain‚Äôs owners. It was not until mid-August 2019 that city officials agreed to release documents about its decision to exclude the company from the airport \\"based on the restaurant chain‚Äôs donations to religious ministries\\". On June 10, 2019, Texas governor Greg Abbott signed into law Senate Bill 1978, colloquially known as the \\"Save Chick-fil-A Bill\\", which forbids local governments from taking adverse steps against companies or individuals based on their religions beliefs. On September 5, a group of five individuals filed suit against the City of San Antonio citing this new law. =Backlash= Students at several colleges and universities launched efforts to ban or remove the company's restaurants from their campuses. On November 3, 2011, New York University's Student Senators Council voted 19 to 4 to retain the Chick-fil-A franchise on campus. This vote came before a petition with over 11,000 signatures opposing its presence on campus was sent to the student council. Christine Quinn, a lesbian politician and then-Speaker of the City Council who was seeking the nomination as Democratic candidate for the mayoralty in the next election, was outspoken in her opposition to keeping the Chick-fil-A franchise or allowing others, and wrote a letter to this effect to NYU President John Sexton on official letterhead, opening with the words, \\"I write as the Speaker of the NYC Council\\", urging NYU to evict a Chick-fil-A due to Cathy's opposition to same-sex marriage. Christine Quinn letter to NYU , nydailynews.com; accessed July 24, 2015.\\"Christine Quinn wants Chick-Fil-A to quit New York\\" , nydailynews.com; accessed July 24, 2015. On February 28, 2012, Northeastern University's Student Senate passed a resolution to cancel plans for a Chick-fil-A franchise on its campus, stating \\"the student body does not support bringing CFA [Chick-fil-A] to campus\\", and \\"Student concerns reflected CFA's history of donating to anti-gay organizations.\\" The vote was 31 to 5, with 8 abstaining. The restaurant chain was finalizing a contract to bring it to NU when students protested. Davidson College in North Carolina announced on August 13, 2012 that, in response to a petition which received 500 signatures, the school would stop serving Chick-fil-A on campus at the monthly \\"After Midnight\\" events. Other forms of protest occurred. Gay rights activists organized a \\"Kiss Off\\" to occur on August 3, an event where LGBT individuals would show affection in public, but it attracted smaller-than- hoped-for crowds. On August 15, 2012, a gunman attempted to enter the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Family Research Council, carrying 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches, a 9 mm handgun, and a box of ammunition. He shot a security guard in the left arm, and following his arrest he told police that he wanted to use the sandwiches to \\"make a statement against the people who work in that building ... and with their stance against gay rights and Chick- fil-A\\", and that he planned \\"to kill as many people as I could ... then smear a Chicken-fil-A [sic] sandwich on their face\\". Chick-fil-A announced their expansion to Canada in the city of Toronto. This caused a number of boycotts and backlash from Canadians due to the widespread support for LGBT rights in Canada. In August 2019, the Toronto Star ran an opinion piece, written by its National Columnist (staff), with the headline \\"Chick-fil-A is about to open in Toronto. I hope it fails\\". She said that comment was made because the company was operated by \\"someone who dislikes 'my lifestyle' as Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy would probably refer to my lesbianism\\". The store opened on 6 September 2019 on Yonge St. at Bloor St. in Toronto, with LGBTQ2 protesters in attendance, complaining about the company's \\"history of supporting anti-LGBTQ causes\\", according to the Toronto Star. At that time, the company confirmed its plan to open 14 others in the Greater Toronto Area over the subsequent five years. On November 18, 2019, it was reported that Chick-fil-A will stop donating to the Salvation Army and Fellowship of Christian Athletes, two Christian organizations that oppose same-sex marriage. =Corporate partners= In response to the July 2, 2012 interview, the Jim Henson Company, which had entered its Pajanimals in a kids' meal toy licensing arrangement in 2011, said that it would cease its business relationship with Chick-fil-A, and donate payment for the brand to Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Citing safety concerns, Chick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys. A spokeswoman stated the decision had been made on July 19 and was unrelated to the controversy. Curtis Wong. \\"Chick-Fil-A Recalling Jim Henson Kids' Meal Toys As Partnership Severed Over Anti-Gay Donations\\" , The Huffington Post, July 24, 2012. In August 2012, petitions with over 80,000 signatures were delivered to publisher HarperCollins demanding the publisher cut plans to include Berenstain Bears titles as part of a kids' meal promotion. Upon being presented with petitions demanding that Berenstain Bears be pulled from a Chick-fil-A promotion, HarperCollins issued a statement saying \\"We have a long history of diversity and inclusiveness and work tirelessly to protect the freedom of expression. It is not our practice to cancel a contract with an author, or any other party, for exercising their first amendment rights.\\" Goddard, Jacqui. \\"Gay rights come to Toy Town as Chick-fil-A battle continues\\" , telegraph.co.uk; accessed August 13, 2012. =Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day= In response to the controversy, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee initiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott of Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists. More than 600,000 people RSVPed on Facebook for Huckabee's appreciation event. On August 1, 2012, Chick-fil-A restaurants experienced a large show of public support across the nation with the company reporting record-breaking sales. A consulting firm projected that the average Chick-fil-A restaurant increased sales by 29.9 percent and had 367 more customers than a typical Wednesday. =Public polling= In August 2012, Rasmussen Reports published the results of a telephone survey indicating that 61 percent of likely voters held a favorable view of Chick-fil-A, while 13 percent indicated they would participate in a boycott. =Others= Other notable public figures came to Chick-fil-A's defense, including former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, former US Senator Rick Santorum, and Ann Coulter; while New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the American Civil Liberties Union publicly disagreed with Cathy's positions but defended his right to express them under the First Amendment. =Financial effect= Sales increased after the controversy. According to news coverage following the controversy: =October 2019 closure of UK location= On 18 October 2019, it was announced that Chick-fil-A's location at The Oracle, Reading in Reading, Berkshire, the first location in the United Kingdom, would close due to the Oracle not renewing their lease. The announcement had been preceded by severe criticism from LGBT rights activists in Reading and elsewhere in the UK.

It broadcasts on 105 FM. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) described it in 2012 as \\"one of Cambodia's few independent news outlets\\".  Programming  In 2012, Human Rights Watch described Beehive Radio as \\"a key platform for promotion of human rights and democracy in Cambodia\\". The station is one of the few to address controversial topics, including \\"Cambodian civil society, the fight against HIV/AIDS, maternal mortality and human trafficking, campaigns for women‚Äôs rights and gender equality, political and economic transparency, equitable and sustainable development, labor rights, environmental protection, the rule of law, and electoral education and election monitoring.\\" It also carries programming by Radio Free Asia, Voice of America, and the Cambodian Center for Human Rights.  History  In 1995, Mam Sonando, a French- Cambodian dual citizen, returned to Cambodia and acquired a broadcasting license for a new station that he named Beehive Radio. It began broadcasting on August 6, 1996. He used the station to advertise a new political party, the Beehive Democratic Society Party, and stood in the 1998 general election. According to the Asia Times, his campaign only won him \\"a reputation as an eccentric, spouting Buddhist philosophy, pleas for democracy and a personal campaign for attention.\\" After failing to be elected, Sonando dissolved his party, but continued broadcasting on Beehive Radio as an independent journalist. As of 2012, Sonando had been arrested three times on charges related to the station's broadcasts. In 2003, during the Phnom Penh riots, a caller to Beehive Radio claimed incorrectly that Cambodian embassy officials were killed in Bangkok. On 31 January, Sonando was arrested and accused of \\"relaying false information\\", \\"inciting discrimination\\", and \\"inciting crime\\". He stated to reporters, \\"They blame me for broadcasting an opinion of a listener which turned out to be untrue. But if I have to go to jail to allow people to express their opinion I am happy.\\" He was released on bail on 11 February and never brought to trial. Sonando was arrested again on 11 October 2005 after reporting on Prime Minister Hun Sen's treaty with Vietnam settling the two nations' border dispute; the report included a discussion with a French-based expert who criticized Hun Sen's concessions. Sonando was charged with \\"criminal defamation\\", \\"disseminating false information\\", and \\"incitement\\". In January 2006, the charges against him were dropped in what Prime Minister Hun Sen described as \\"a gift\\" to visiting US Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill. On 15 July 2012, he was arrested again and accused of involvement with protests against evictions for a new rubber plant in Krati√© Province. Authorities charged him with \\"insurrection\\" and \\"inciting people to take up weapons against state\\". The arrest quickly generated domestic and international criticism. A coalition of 22 Cambodian rights groups called the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee called on the government to free Sonando \\"to save the country's reputation\\". Members of Beehive Radio and the Association of Democrats protested in front of Phnom Penh's royal palace on 23 July. CPJ called for his immediate release, stating that Hun Sen had \\"a well-worn history of leveling unsubstantiated anti-state charges against journalists to stifle criticism of the administration.\\" Human Rights Watch said that \\"Sonando's arrest on the heels of [US Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton's visit is a brazen signal that Hun Sen thinks that the US wants his cooperation on other matters so much that he isn't afraid to lower the boom on his critics\\". Amnesty International named Sonando a prisoner of conscience, \\"held for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression\\".

The game was originally published in Newgrounds but was removed by Anna so that she could sell it elsewhere. Plot Touching on the 'frustrations' of transitioning, particularly taking estrogen, the game documents a six-month period in her treatment via a succession of mini-games that reflect on gender politics, identity, personal responsibility, white privilege, and personal development. While discussing the concept with the Penny Arcade Report, Anna Anthropy remarked, \\"This was a story about frustration‚Äîin what other form do people complain as much about being frustrated? A video game lets you set up goals for the player and make her fail to achieve them. A reader can‚Äôt fail a book. It‚Äôs an entirely different level of empathy that most people simply cannot comprehend, and so the game makes this particular empathetic frustration available for all to experience.\\" Reception After debuting at a Toronto-based art game convention between 21 and 23 February 2012, Dys4ia subsequently appeared on the social media website Newgrounds on 9 March 2012, and achieved a First Place 'Daily Feature'. Dys4ia received praise from various sources for its ability to communicate a challenging subject. The Guardians Will Freeman commented that Dys4ia offered 'a touching and witty insight into an experience many may never even consider in detail'. In response to the mechanics of Dys4ia, Freeman suggested that the game 'does much to prove the power of games to communicate complex concepts through playful interactions'. On the UK gaming blog Rock, Paper, Shotgun, journalist Adam Smith found the content 'uncomfortable' and inherently private, yet nevertheless 'informative and moving'. Regarding the absent artistic merits of Dys4ia, Smith remarked that the limited visuals were 'effective communicators of extreme discomfort' and that Liz Ryerson's soundtrack to the game deserved special mention due to how well it conveys a sense of listless frustration and extreme discomfort simultaneously.

Biography =Early years, 1497‚Äì1535= Dionisio Laurerio was born in Benevento in 1497.Entry from Biographical Dictionary of the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church He was from a little-known family with links to the Pedicini family, a local patrician family. Both of his parents were originally from Florence. He entered the Servite Order at a young age and was educated by his order. He obtained a doctorate in 1521. After he was ordained as a priest, he became a lector of philosophy, metaphysics, mathematics, and theology at the University of Perugia and the University of Bologna from 1526 to 1529, then at the Sapienza University of Rome. At a chapter of the Servite Order held in Cesena on 18 May 1528, he was elected procurator of the order. In 1534, Henry VIII of England made Laurerio his minister to Pope Clement VII, replacing Thomas Cranmer. Laurerio traveled to London to deal with urgent religious matters in the Kingdom of England. At that time, he developed a friendship with Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, the future Pope Paul III, who he probably already knew from Benevento, and who made Laurerio his theologian in sacris. Laurerio also developed friendships with humanist Jacopo Sannazzaro and Cardinals Reginald Pole and Jacopo Sadoleto. =Early years as Superior General of the Servite Order, 1535‚Äì39= Pope Paul III made Laurerio vicar general of the Servite Order on 22 January 1535. On 27 April 1535, at a chapter celebrated in Bologna, the Servite Order elected him to be its superior general. He resigned this post in May 1542. While he was superior general, the pope gave him the ability to found, visit, and reform any monasteries of his order. On 23 October 1536 the pope named him his nuncio to James V of Scotland, tasking him with reporting on the desirability of holding an ecumenical council, and also giving him the powers of a legate a latere to visit and reform institutions in the Kingdom of Scotland to prevent them from joining Henry VIII of England in breaking with Rome. Laurerio met James in Paris on 27 January 1537 and probably never actually visited Scotland. He convinced the king to support an ecumenical council but was unable to convince the cloistered of the Kingdom of France to agree. In autumn 1537 he was back in Rome where he participated in discussions on reforming the Apostolic Dataria. =Cardinal, 1539‚Äì42= Pope Paul III made him a cardinal priest in the consistory of 19 December 1539. He received the red hat on 22 December 1539, and the titular church of San Marcello al Corso on 28 January 1540. On 13 February 1540 he was elected Bishop of Urbino. He took possession of the see on 3 March 1540. In early August 1540 he accompanied the pope to Lucca to meet Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor to discuss convening an ecumenical council in Vicenza. In poor health, he then went to rest in convents in Pistoia, Prato, and then Florence for a few months. He also acted as nuncio to Cosimo de' Medici during this period. He also played a crucial role in restoring the baths of Bagni San Filippo. He also stopped in Urbino to begin the canonization process for the Servite Girolamo Ranuzzi, installing his relics in that city. On 27 August 1540 the pope tasked him and Cardinals Gasparo Contarini and Gian Pietro Carafa with studying proposals to reform the Apostolic Penitentiary; this commission met sporadically. In spring 1541, the pope despatched Cardinal Laurerio to Modena as pontifical inquisitor delegate for the process against writer Giovanni Bertario. Bertario had been excommunicated in absentia; together with Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, Cardinal Laurerio had this sentence reduced, ordering Bertario to recant his allegedly heretical statements. In the consistory of 27 May 1541 Cardinal Gasparo Contarini presented a proposal for reconciliation with the Protestants, supported by Cardinal Alvise Priuli. Cardinal Laurerio vehemently opposed this proposal. Resigning as superior general of the Servite Order in May 1542, he convoked a general chapter of the order in spring 1542, which saw him replaced by Agostino Bonucci. When, on 21 July 1542, Pope Paul III issued the papal bull Licet ab initio reorganizing the Roman Inquisition, Laurerio was named one of the six cardinal inquisitors of the reformed Inquisition. On 11 August 1542 the pope named him papal legate in Benevento and provisor of the Campagne and Maritime Province. He died in Rome on 17 September 1542 after a brief illness. He was buried in his titular church of San Marcello al Corso.

Plot  On a secluded island, Hwa and his girlfriend are killed by a chainsaw-wielding man covered in bandages. Later, three couples (Professor and Linda, Ken and Winnie, and Soldier and Be Be) travel to the same location by boat, planning on camping out on the island for three days. To ensure they are not disturbed, Soldier collects everyone's cell phones and hides them, though as he leaves the hiding spot someone takes the phones. That night, the sextet run into a group of four led by Boar, who claims to be a prophylactic salesman (in actually, he and his associates are smugglers looking for Hwa). Boar's henchmen, Pervert and Blowie, wander off to urinate, and accidentally pee on and set fire to a deformed boy they encounter. Pervert and Blowie run off, and the boy returns home, where he is tended to by his father, the bandaged man. In the afternoon of the next day, Pervert is captured by the boy and his father, who dismember him with a chainsaw. Blowie tells Boar that he thinks something has happened to Pervert, but is ignored. While Pervert goes to hang out with the couples, Boar and his wife Mi Mi are captured by the bandaged man, who takes them to his home. In attempt to barter for his freedom, Boar tries to teach the man's son how to \\"screw\\" Mi Mi, but she enrages the man into killing her when she knocks the boy away. Boar escapes the house, but triggers a tripwire on his way out, and is impaled by punji sticks. While going to wash dishes, Linda and Be Be find Boar's body, and the latter is captured by the bandaged man. After Linda tells the others what happened, Soldier goes off to find Be Be, eventually stumbling onto the killer's lair, where he is killed with his own knife. The next to die is Blowie, who goes off alone to find a cell phone he and Pervert had earlier lost. The killer gives chase to the other campers, but loses them, so he returns home, and decapitates Be Be when she rejects his son's advances. When a fight breaks out between the remaining campers, they become separated, and Winnie and Linda are captured. Professor and Ken find the killer's home by following his oblivious son, and rescue the girls by taking the son hostage. As the group is escaping, Professor triggers the reset punji sticks, and he and the son are killed by them. The next day, Ken and the two girls lure the killer into a trap they have set, a snare which swings him into tent spikes embedded in a tree. As the trio celebrate their victory, the killer's previously unseen wife appears, and slices Linda's neck open with her husband's dropped chainsaw. The wife chases Ken to a cliff, which he knocks her off of. With every member of the deranged family apparently dead, Ken and Winnie go back to their campsite, just as their boat arrives. After Ken and Winnie board the boat, the wife's hand shoots out of the water, and grabs the side of it.

A score of three out of five was given by Hysteria Lives!, which said that while the film may have had a clich√©d plot, it was still \\"a lot of dumb fun\\" with a formidable antagonist, nice cinematography, fast and frenetic action, and some genuinely tense moments. Monster Hunter criticized the film for its weak story, lack of characterization, disappointing bloodshed and bad actors, writing that \\"Other than the fact that this is a product of Hong Kong, The Deadly Camp is a fairly typical slasher movie, and while not the worst one you've ever seen, it's nowhere near what you'd call good.\\" So Good Reviews also responded negatively to the film, deadpanning that it had \\"crappy actors performing crappy characters under crappy direction\\" and extremely poor gore effects. Another critical review was given by Soiled Sinema, which said The Deadly Camp \\"doesn't demonstrate aptness in any category\\" and suffered from annoying characters and a nonsensical plot.

He previously played for the Toronto Blue Jays. Stroman is listed at , making him one of only six pitchers shorter than to make a start at the MLB level in the 21st century. Stroman attended Duke University, and played college baseball for the Duke Blue Devils. He made his MLB debut with the Blue Jays in 2014. In 2017, he was the World Baseball Classic MVP. After the regular season, he was awarded a 2017 Rawlings Gold Glove Award. The Blue Jays traded Stroman to the Mets in 2019. High school and college Marcus Earl Stroman was born in Medford, New York, on May 1, 1991. He attended Patchogue-Medford High School in Medford, and was drafted in the 18th round of the 2009 MLB draft (532nd overall) by the Washington Nationals. He opted not sign, and instead entered Duke University, where he played college baseball for the Duke Blue Devils baseball team. At Duke, Stroman compiled a career record of 15‚Äì13 in 48 appearances, and set the Duke record for career strikeouts (290 over 222 innings pitched). He was also a position player for Duke, making 97 appearances, mostly at second base and shortstop. In 2010 and 2011, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named a league all-star in 2010. On May 15, 2016, Stroman graduated from Duke University with a bachelor's degree in sociology. Professional career =Minor leagues= Billed by analysts as the most major league ready player available in the 2012 MLB draft, Stroman was drafted by the Jays 22nd overall, and became the first Duke player ever selected in the first round. After starting his professional career with the Low-A Vancouver Canadians, the Blue Jays promoted Stroman to the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats on August 1, 2012. Stroman was suspended for 50 games on August 28, 2012, for testing positive for methylhexanamine, a banned stimulant. Having completed his suspension, Stroman started and pitched five scoreless innings to get the win in the May 19, 2013 game for the Fisher Cats. On July 2, 2013, Stroman struck out 13 batters over 6 innings in a 3‚Äì1 loss to the New Britain Rock Cats. He was ranked as the number 3 prospect in the Blue Jays organization on July 26, 2013, when the revised Top 100 Prospects list was released. Stroman attended the Blue Jays' 2014 major league spring training camp, and was assigned to the minor league camp on March 19. He was the 2014 Opening Day starting pitcher for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. =Toronto Blue Jays= 2014‚Äì2015 Stroman was called up to the Blue Jays on May 3, 2014, after Brandon Morrow was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. At the time of his call-up, he was considered the organization's number two prospect. He earned his first MLB victory on May 6, pitching 1 innings in relief of Drew Hutchison. Stroman was optioned back to Triple-A Buffalo on May 18, and was recalled on May 30 to make his first Major League start the following day. He pitched six innings and surrendered only one earned run on five hits, striking out six and issuing no walks to earn the win over the Kansas City Royals. On August 9, Stroman pitched nine innings for the first time in his career, but came away with a no-decision as the Blue Jays defeated the Detroit Tigers 3‚Äì2 in extra innings. He would earn his first complete game and shutout on September 8, needing only 93 pitches to beat the Chicago Cubs, 8‚Äì0. Stroman yielded only three hits and at one point had retired 19 consecutive batters. On September 17, Stroman was suspended six games and fined an undisclosed amount for intentionally throwing at Caleb Joseph during a game against the Baltimore Orioles. Immediately following the announcement, he filed an appeal of the suspension. On September 21, Stroman dropped his appeal, and MLB reduced his suspension to five games. It was announced shortly afterward that upon his return from the suspension, he would be moved to the bullpen for the remainder of the season. Stroman pitched four innings in relief of Drew Hutchison's final start of the season on September 26, and earned his first career save. He did not appear in the final two games of the Blue Jays season, and finished 2014 with an 11‚Äì6 record, 3.65 ERA, 111 strikeouts, and a 1.17 WHIP in 130 innings pitched. Stroman in his 2015 debut On October 6, 2014, Stroman announced through his Twitter account that he would change his uniform number from 54 to 6 in honor of his grandmother. During 2015 spring training, Stroman suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. He underwent a successful surgery, performed by Dr. James Andrews, to repair his ACL. Stroman was placed on the 60-day disabled list on April 5. While rehabbing the injury, Stroman returned to Duke University to finish his degree, majoring in Sociology with a minor in Markets and Management Studies. On August 5, it was announced that Stroman would begin a rehab assignment later in the month. He threw off a mound for the first time since his injury on August 11, after receiving medical clearance the day prior. General Manager Alex Anthopoulos stated afterward that Stroman would be stretched out as a starter in his rehab. Stroman threw a 40-pitch simulated game on August 24, and a 51-pitch game on August 28. On September 2, he made his Class-A debut with the Lansing Lugnuts and pitched 4 innings, yielding no hits while walking one and striking out seven. He made his second and final rehab start on September 7, with the Buffalo Bisons. Manager John Gibbons confirmed on September 8 that Stroman would return as a starting pitcher, and make his 2015 debut against the New York Yankees on September 12. He was activated from the 60-day disabled list on September 11, and started the second game of a doubleheader the following day. Stroman would pitch five innings and earn the win, yielding three runs before being removed due to a rain delay. He would make three more starts and finish the 2015 regular season with a 4‚Äì0 record, 1.67 ERA, and 18 strikeouts in 27 innings pitched. Stroman played his first career postseason game in Game 2 of the 2015 American League Division Series against the Texas Rangers. He gave up three earned runs and struck out five, retiring 14 consecutive batters at one point. He pitched seven innings and received a no-decision in the loss. He started again in Game 5 of the same series, allowing six hits and two earned runs over six innings in an eventual 6‚Äì3 Blue Jays victory. 2016‚Äì2017 On March 23, 2016, Stroman was named the Opening Day starter for the Blue Jays. He pitched into the ninth inning, holding the Tampa Bay Rays to three runs on six hits, while striking out 5 in a 5‚Äì3 win. Stroman established a new career-high in strikeouts, with 9, in a 5‚Äì1 win over the Rays on May 1. He also set a Blue Jays franchise-record for strikeouts on a pitcher's birthday, surpassing David Price, Marc Rzepczynski, and Roy Halladay, who each had 8 strikeouts in starts on their birthdays. Stroman improved on his single-game strikeout record on August 1, when he struck out 13 Houston Astros batters in a no-decision. He finished the 2016 regular season with a 9‚Äì10 record, 4.37 ERA, and 166 strikeouts over a career-high 204 innings pitched. He had the highest ground ball percentage among major league pitchers (60.1%), and the lowest fly ball percentage (20.4%). On October 3, the Blue Jays announced that Stroman would start the Wild Card game against the Baltimore Orioles the following day. He pitched a full six innings, giving up just two earned runs and striking out six, as the Blue Jays won the game 5‚Äì2 in extra innings and advanced to the 2016 American League Division Series to play the Texas Rangers. Stroman was scheduled to start the fourth game of the ALDS against the Rangers, however the Blue Jays swept Texas and advanced to play the Cleveland Indians in the American League Championship Series. Stroman pitched 5 and yielded four earned runs in Game 3 of the ALCS, his lone start of the series. On February 14, 2017, it was announced that Stroman had won his arbitration case and would receive a $3.4 million salary for the 2017 season. In a 6‚Äì5 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on April 25, Stroman recorded the first hit of his career. His double to left field was the first ever pinch hit by a Blue Jays pitcher, and also the first extra-base pinch hit by an American League pitcher since Gary Peters in 1971. Stroman hit an opposite field home run off Julio Teher√°n in the Blue Jays 9‚Äì0 win over the Atlanta Braves on May 18, 2017. In doing so, Stroman became just the second Blue Jays pitcher to hit a home run, joining Mark Hendrickson, who did so on June 21, 2003. Stroman's home run followed Luke Maile's solo shot, making the batterymates the first to hit back-to-back home runs since 1970. He also became the first pitcher listed 5' 8\\" or shorter to hit a home run in the majors since Tom Phoebus of the Baltimore Orioles did so in 1968. On July 3, Stroman left a game against the New York Yankees after five innings when a blister developed on his right middle finger, though the injury did not cause him to miss a start. Stroman was hit on the right elbow by a line drive in Toronto's 7‚Äì2 win over the Baltimore Orioles on September 2, and was forced to leave the game, though he was once again able to make his next start. Stroman finished the 2017 season with 13 wins, 164 strikeouts, and a 3.09 ERA in 201 innings. By passing the 200-inning mark, he became the seventh Blue Jays pitcher in the prior 20 years to have consecutive 200-inning seasons. He again had the highest ground ball percentage among major league pitchers (62.1%), and the lowest fly ball percentage (19.7%). He gave up the longest home run of all major league pitchers in 2017, at 496 feet. On October 28, Stroman was named a finalist for the American League pitcher's Gold Glove Award, along with Alex Cobb and Chris Sale. Stroman won the award on November 7. The Toronto chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America unanimously voted Stroman the Blue Jays' Pitcher of the Year for 2017. 2018‚Äì2019 On February 15, 2018, Stroman announced through his Twitter account that he had lost his arbitration case and would make $6.5 million for the season instead of his requested salary of $6.9 million. Stroman struggled to start the 2018 season, going 0‚Äì5 with a 7.71 ERA before being placed on the 10-day disabled list due to right shoulder fatigue on May 11. On June 13, he made his High-A debut with the Dunedin Blue Jays and pitched 4 innings in a rehab start, surrendering two runs on one hit while walking four and striking out three. Stroman returned to Toronto's rotation on June 23, pitching five shutout innings against the Los Angeles Angels. Later in the season, Stroman was forced to leave starts on August 7 and 17 against the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees, respectively due to blisters in his pitching hand. He would return again on September 3 to start against the Tampa Bay Rays, however, blisters again forced him out of the game. Stroman would not return again in 2018 after this start, ending his 2018 season with a 4‚Äì9 record and a 5.54 ERA in 19 starts. On March 13, 2019, Stroman was announced as the Opening Day starter by Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo. On June 30, Stroman was named to the 2019 MLB All-Star Game, his first all-star nomination of his career. =New York Mets= On July 28, 2019, the Toronto Blue Jays traded Stroman (along with cash considerations) to the New York Mets for pitching prospects Anthony Kay and Simeon Woods Richardson. On November 15, 2019, Stroman announced via Twitter he was switching to number 0 for the 2020 season and also changed his Twitter handle to @STR0. Earlier in the offseason, he stated he wanted to give up No. 7 in honor of Jose Reyes.https://www.sny.tv/mets/news/mets-pitcher-marcus-stroman-announces-what- jersey-number-hell-be-wearing-in-2020/311888850 That offseason, he also hired Nikki Huffman as his personal trainer, away from the Toronto Blue Jays where she served as head trainer. He first met her in 2015 at Duke University where she helped him recover from a torn ACL ahead of schedule. Stroman missed the beginning of the 2020 season with a torn left calf muscle. On August 10, 2020, before his return, he announced he would opt out of the season, ending his Mets tenure. International career =World Baseball Classic= In December 2016, Stroman announced that he would play for Team USA at the 2017 World Baseball Classic. He made three starts for the team, and posted a 2.35 ERA in 15 total innings. In the final game, Stroman held Team Puerto Rico scoreless and without a hit through six innings, leading Team USA to an 8‚Äì0 victory and their first WBC championship. Following the game, Stroman was named the tournament's most valuable player (MVP). He was also named to the All-World Baseball Classic team. Pitching style Stroman on the MLB Network during the 2015 MLB postseason Stroman's repertoire includes six pitches: his four- seam fastball and two-seam fastball average and respectively. His off-speed pitches include a curveball at , a changeup at , a cutter at , and a slider at . He has relied more on his two-seam fastball (about 41-44%) since the 2015 season.

Lovecraft wrote him a fan letter after reading his \\"Lead Soldiers\\". Johnson repaid the complement by including Lovecraft as a character in \\"Far Below\\". Dorothy McIlwraith later described \\"Far Below\\" as \\"the best from Weird Tales\\". Later stories included \\"Lupa\\" and \\"The Strange Case of Monica Lilith\\". Johnson wrote stories of circus life for Blue Book. He also wrote for magazines such as Mystic, Short Stories, and The Magazine of Horror.Michael Ashley, Transformations: the Story of the Science- fiction Magazines In his guide book The Magic Park (Century Press, 1940) he wrote about the Golden Gate Park - this work was partly a guidebook and partly an unconventional creative work about the nature and what one might term the \\"enchanted topography\\" of the park. During World War II he served in the artillery in the 1952th Service Command Unit. After the war ended he remained in San Francisco, and turned to more mainstream fiction under contract to Blue Book - providing them with six long circus stories per year.

The ship operated within the Canadian Coast Guard Maritimes region. Matthew was primarily used to carry out hydrographic survey work primarily for the production of nautical charting products on the East and West Coasts, but could also be used for stock assessment using sonar. In 2016, the ship was taken out of service and put up for sale. Two years later a bid for $279,000 was accepted by the Canadian government and is currently in transition of new ownership. Description Matthew is of steel construction and is long with a beam of and a draught of . The ship has and a . The ship is powered by two Caterpillar 3508 geared diesel engines rated at driving two controllable pitch propellers and a bow thruster. This gives the ship a maximum speed of . The ship has a fuel capacity of giving the ship a range of at 12 knots and an endurance of 20 days. The ship is also equipped with two Caterpillar 3406 generators and one Caterpillar 3406 emergency generator. Matthew is equipped with four boats and has one HIAB seacrane capable of lifting . The ship has two laboratories both ; one for hydrographic purposes and one for combined hydrographic/drafting purposes. The research vessel is equipped with Sperry Marine Bridgemaster II navigational radar operating on the X-band. The ship has a complement of 14, with 6 officers and 8 crew. Matthew also has six additional berths. =Refits= During 2005 the vessel was equipped with an advanced, multi-beam echo-sounder. The transducers for this equipment are housed in a centerline pod which extends below the keel.Refit tender notice Suggested alterations to sonar were met with a lack of enthusiasm. Nonetheless, subsequent missions were able to be conducted with only minor delays, none of which were related to the new sonars. As a part of Canada's Economic Action Plan in 2009‚Äì2010, Matthew underwent a refit in Quebec City costing over $105,000, involving systems replacement, crane replacement, and reliability improvements. In May 2011 Matthew received a short refit. Matthew has minimal ice strengthening in its forward hull, and no strengthening of its rudders, shafting and propellers for operation in ice-covered waters. Construction and career Constructed by Versatile Pacific Shipyards Ltd. at their yard in North Vancouver, British Columbia with the yard number 511. Matthew was launched on 29 April 1990 and completed in September 1990. The ship was commissioned that year and named for John Cabot's ship from his second voyage to North America. The name came from a competition among high school students from Newfoundland and Labrador. The ship was based at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Nova Scotia and registered in Ottawa, Ontario. In 1998, Matthew was among the Canadian Coast Guard vessels assigned to the search for Swissair Flight 111, mapping the wreckage off the coast of Nova Scotia. The ship participated in the mapping of Placentia Bay, Newfoundland in co-operation with Natural Resources Canada and the Canadian Hydrographic Service in April 2004. The vessel was used for mapping the coastal sea floor and harbour entries, which allowed smaller craft to keep closer the shoreline rather than sail out in the heavier seas. The vessel spent much of its time updating nautical charts that had not been reviewed since the time of Captain James Cook. Matthew was also detailed to investigate sinkholes in Bras d‚ÄôOr Lake of Cape Breton Island. Matthew was decommissioned in 2016, renamed 2015-03 and was put up for auction. The former Coast Guard vessel was taken out of service due to a change in the way coastal mapping was to be performed by the government, with a switch towards \\"coastal parties, ship-based surveys and airborne hydrography.\\" The ship was put up for auction five times, receiving no bids.

It was coproduced by Soviet Union (where it was released as Krasnye kolokola, film pervyy ‚Äì Meksika v ogne), Italy (where is known as Messico in fiamme) and Mexico (where its title is Campanas rojas). It is the first of a two-part film centered on the life and career of John Reed, the revolutionary communist journalist that had already inspired Warren Beatty's Reds. This chapter focuses on Reed's reportage about 1915 Mexican revolution. It was followed by Red Bells II.

It consists of a large clay pot with a thin skin head stretched over the mouth, and fixed with cords. It is struck directly with fingers and palm, to produce bass and slap sounds.

Dallas) is an American singer, producer and songwriter. After signing with Latium Records in 2004, Blocker later formed independent label Blockerboy Music LLC on which he released the EP Alone, the album Love and Lust (in Japan) and the Billboard chart hit \\"Rock Ya Body\\". Early life Blocker was born and reared for a short time in Dallas, Texas by his mother, but later joined his father at age seven in Trinity Gardens ‚Äì a Northeast Houston, Texas neighborhood. He began singing and performing in church at a young age, and eventually chose the stage name ‚ÄúDallas‚Äù to acknowledge both the city in which he was born and his mother, a long-time Dallas, Texas resident. Musical Beginnings While acclimating to life in Houston, Blocker busied himself singing, learning to produce music and penning his own lyrics. While attending Kashmere High School and during college, Blocker was a member of a male R&B; group, which included Brian Angel of Day26. The group environment allowed Blocker to use his skills as a songwriter, producer and lead vocalist to amass the interest of new fans and local music industry executives. Career: Collaborations Blocker has collaborated with many noted musical artists throughout his career, including producer Bryan Michael Cox; lead vocalist of R&B; group H-Town the late Kevin ‚ÄúDino‚Äù Conner; rappers Bun B, Rick Ross, J-Dawg, Z-Ro, Slim Thug, Tum Tum, Lil Flip, Mike Jones, Paul Wall, and Trae; and several KBXX DJs. His work includes lead vocals, production and writing on \\"Get It Girl,\\" which is featured on the Bring It On: All or Nothing music soundtrack, and \\"After Da Club\\" with the late rapper Hawk. It was this smash hit that allowed Blocker to forge a relationship with Latium Records, which hosts artist Pitbull and formerly hosted artists Chamillionaire, Slim Thug, Frankie J, Natalie and Baby Bash. Career: Solo Efforts In 2008, Blocker took control of his music career by establishing his independent label Blockerboy Music LLC following a year under contract, and later, a voluntary release from Latium Records. With the release of Alone (EP) and the subsequent release of the Love & Lust album in Japan, Blocker soon headlined Japan's Save R&B; tour in September 2009 and opened for R&B; star Babyface at Houston's Arena Theater in August 2010. In 2010, Blocker's smash hit ‚ÄúRock Ya Body,‚Äù produced by Texas hit-making duo Beanz N Kornbread, debuted on Billboard‚Äôs Top 100 chart at #75 and was heard by more than two million listeners weekly with heavy radio play in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. The single spent 20 weeks on the Billboard charts. To accompany the single's wave of success, the ‚ÄúRock Ya Body‚Äù video, which was directed by Michael Kimbrew in association with TF Records, was also released in 2010, and featured Farrah Franklin (formerly of Destiny's Child), Montana Fishburne and Orlando Brown. In 2011, Blocker released the single ‚ÄúOut Da Club‚Äù featuring Diamond; soon after, the single's video‚Äîfeaturing Z-Ro and directed by JC Visuals in association with Blockerboy Music LLC‚Äîfollowed.
