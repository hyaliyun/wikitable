They were numbered 3600‚Äì3799 by CP and were used almost everywhere around the system. Construction history The order for these engines came around 1912 when CP wanted bigger locomotives for their mainline. Their current engines were wearing out and were too small for the loads that were being hauled. The Montreal Locomotive Works was the one who did the job. Modifications These locomotives were originally numbered 3800‚Äì3999. They were renumbered between 1920 and 1929 renumbered to the 3600 and 3700s. Most of the class were converted to oil-firing in the later years. In the 1920s onward Canadian Pacific saw an increasing need for larger locomotives. Most of this class were relocated to either CP's Ogden or Montreal shops for a short time while 65 were converted to Class P1n 2-8-2 renumbered 5200-5264 in 1946 a larger boiler was added as well as a trailing truck and a new cab. They could haul several more thousand pounds than the original 2-8-0's could. Many of this class were converted, although not all, as many survived as 2-8-0's until the end of steam on CP. Preservation Of the one hundred eighty-two locomotives that were built, only three remain in existence. 3512 still exists, although not in a heritage park. On January 1, 1947, 3512 was returning to Nelson when the rail barge tipped and the entire train fell into the water. The complete engine, with tender, caboose, and snowplow, still reside at the bottom of Slocan Lake. Engine 3651 was saved and is displayed in Lethbridge. 3716 was used on the British Columbia Museum Train for many years, also serving as a backup locomotive to the 2860 Royal Hudson.

It stars Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox as father-and-son coroners who experience supernatural phenomena while examining the body of an unidentified woman (played by Olwen Kelly). It is √òvredal's first English-language film. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2016, and was released on December 21, 2016, by IFC Midnight. It grossed $6 million at the box office. The critical consensus at Rotten Tomatoes calls it \\"a smart, suggestively creepy thriller\\".  Plot  The corpse of an unidentified young woman is found at the scene of a bloody multiple homicide. Sheriff Sheldon Burke finds no signs of forced entry, and Lieutenant Wade suggests that the victims were trying to escape. Emma visits her boyfriend, Austin Tilden, and his father, Tommy, a small town coroner. Tommy explains that coroners in the past used to tie bells to bodies to ensure they were dead, not comatose. Sheriff Burke arrives with the mysterious body of Jane Doe, and tells Tommy that he needs the cause of death by morning. Austin postpones his date with Emma to help Tommy, promising to meet her later that evening. Tommy and Austin perform the autopsy and quickly become confused. There are no external visible signs of trauma, but her wrist and ankle bones had been shattered. Her tongue has been crudely cut out, one of her molars is missing, her lungs are blackened as though she had suffered third degree burns, and her internal organs reveal numerous cuts and scarring. Jimsonweed, a paralyzing agent not native to the area, is found in her stomach. The condition of much of the body suggests that death had just occurred, while cloudiness of the corpse's eyes suggests she has been dead for several days. Other mysterious events occur. The radio spontaneously changes stations, frequently settling on the song \\"Open Up Your Heart (And Let the Sunshine In)\\", and Austin believes he sees people standing in the morgue's hallway. Investigating, he finds their cat, Stanley, mortally wounded. Tommy snaps Stanley‚Äôs neck to put him out of his misery before reluctantly incinerating the corpse. Continuing the autopsy, Tommy finds the woman's missing tooth wrapped in a piece of cloth in her stomach. The cloth has Roman numerals, letters, and an odd diagram. Similar symbols are found on the inside of her skin. The lights in the room suddenly explode. During the confusion, they realize other corpses in the morgue have gone missing. They decide to leave, but the elevator does not work and a fallen tree is blocking the exit door. An unseen figure bruises Tommy in the bathroom. They return to the autopsy room and again examine the corpse. When the door locks itself, Austin hacks it with an emergency axe. Through an opening, they see one of the missing corpses. Unable to get to the cremation furnace, they set the corpse ablaze in the exam room. The fire spreads rapidly; Tommy puts it out with an extinguisher but is disturbed to find the body has not burned. When the elevator turns back on, Tommy and Austin try to escape, but the doors will not close. Panicked, Tommy uses an axe against what he believes to be one of the animated corpses. When he and Austin exit the elevator, they discover he has killed Emma. Certain that Jane Doe's corpse has been preventing them from finding out the truth about her death, they return to the examination room. Tests determine that Jane Doe's brain tissue cells remain active, proving that she is somehow still alive. Further examination of the cloth determines that the markings refer to Leviticus 20:27, which condemns witches, and the year 1693, the date of the Salem witch trials. Tommy and Austin reason that in their attempt to punish a witch, the Salem authorities instead transformed an innocent woman into a witch, who now wants revenge. Tommy offers himself to the corpse as a sacrifice, hoping she will spare Austin. Tommy's ankles and wrists shatter, mimicking the corpse's wounds. As the wounds occur to Tommy, the corpse's own wounds begin to heal essentially ending her curse. The reason all of her torture was only visible on the interior of her body is because each time Jane heals, its from the outside in, indicating that this process has occurred enough times for her body to look externally pristine while her internal injuries have yet to be resolved. Tommy begs his son to kill him to end his misery. Austin reluctantly stabs his father in the chest with a knife. Believing he hears the sheriff outside, Austin tries to flee but realizes the voice is another hallucination. Startled by a vision of Tommy's corpse, Austin trips over the railing and falls to his death. The police arrive the next morning and are confused by another inexplicable crime scene. The corpse, showing no signs of trauma, is taken to Virginia Commonwealth University. During the ambulance ride, the radio plays \\"Open Up Your Heart (And Let the Sunshine In)\\", and the corpse's big toe twitches.  Cast  * Emile Hirsch as Austin Tilden * Brian Cox as Tommy Tilden * Ophelia Lovibond as Emma * Michael McElhatton as Sheriff Sheldon Burke * Olwen Kelly as Jane Doe * Jane Perry as Lieutenant Wade * Parker Sawyers as Trooper Cole * Mary Duddy as Irene Daniels * Mark Phoenix as Louis Tannis  Production  Coming off of the success of Trollhunter, √òvredal stated that he wanted to \\"prove something\\" specifically that he could do more than found footage style films. He stated, \\"It's just a very specific style that you need to get into specifically for that project.\\" The Conjuring proved to be a spark of inspiration for √òvredal, and he said, \\"it was such a classical horror movie that came at a time where all these movies had tried to do all kinds of different stuff and then suddenly it was like getting back to basics\\". After watching the film, √òvredal told his agency he wanted to \\"find a pure horror script\\", which resulted in being sent Autopsy. The script had previously appeared on the annual Black List. Martin Sheen was initially cast as Tommy but pulled out. Although there are some prosthetics used, the role of the corpse, for the most part, was played by actress Olwen Kelly. √òvredal felt that it was necessary to have an actress for the part to help connect the audience on a human level. On some level the decision was also a practical one as √òvredal believes that doing some of the close up scenes with a prosthetic would've been impossible. √òvredal said that Kelly had the most difficult role in the film, and he credited her with making everyone else comfortable on the set. Kelly was the first person interviewed for the role. √òvredal said they performed further interviews afterward, but he instantly knew she was right for the role. One of the reasons she was selected was her knowledge of yoga, which helped her control her body and breathing. Production in the UK began in London on March 30, 2015. The production filmed at Home Farm in Selling, Kent, which doubled as the exterior and kitchen of the Tilden family home.  Release  The Autopsy of Jane Doe premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2016. It was released in the US on December 21, 2016.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports an approval rating of 87% based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 7.02/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"The Autopsy of Jane Doe subverts the gruesome expectations triggered by its title to deliver a smart, suggestively creepy thriller that bolsters director Andr√© Ovredal's growing reputation.\\" Metacritic gave it a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Dennis Harvey of Variety called it a \\"taut, yet often slyly funny scarefest\\", though he said the climax is unfulfilling. Though he praised the acting, Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter called the film an \\"unsatisfactory compromise\\" of art-house and exploitation film. Richard Whittaker of The Austin Chronicle wrote that √òvredal \\"constructs a sinister claustrophobia\\", then \\"elegantly and disturbingly unwraps the enigma\\". Joe Lipsett of Bloody Disgusting rated it 5/5 stars and wrote, \\"√òvredal masterfully balances the requisite gore with some well-earned jump scares and a foreboding sense of doom.\\" Writing at Dread Central, Ari Drew described it as \\"mostly effective\\". Drew complimented the acting but criticized the film's exposition and scripting near the end. Writer Stephen King and comedian Michael Legge have both spoken in favor of the film.

It has 190-fold higher potency in transactivation assays of the ERŒ≤ relative to the ERŒ± and 93- (rat) and 180-fold (human) preference in binding affinity for the ERŒ≤ over the ERŒ±. In rodents, 8Œ≤-VE2 stimulates follicular growth and to a comparable extent as estradiol, whereas the highly ERŒ±-selective agonist 16Œ±-LE2 has no effect on ovarian follicle development, indicating that the ERŒ≤ and not the ERŒ± is involved in the effects of estrogen on ovarian follicles. In contrast, 16Œ±-LE2 stimulates uterine weight, whereas 8Œ≤-VE2 has no effect, indicating that the ERŒ± and not the ERŒ≤ is involved in the effects of estrogen on the uterus. Research has determined through experimental rodent studies with estradiol, 16Œ±-LE2, and 8Œ≤-VE2 that the positive, protective effects of estrogens on bone formation resorption and bone mineral density are mediated via the ERŒ±, whereas the ERŒ≤ does not appear to be involved. On the other hand, while both ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ are expressed in skeletal muscle, it was found that ERŒ≤ is the predominant ER subtype that is responsible for estrogen stimulation of skeletal muscle growth and regeneration. Moreover, similarly to testosterone, 8Œ≤-VE2 has anabolic effects in skeletal muscle and significantly increases muscle mass as well as produces muscle hypertrophy in rats. In contrast to testosterone however, 8Œ≤-VE2 shows no androgenic effects. The effects of 8Œ≤-VE2 and ERŒ≤ may be mediated, in part, by local stimulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-induced myogenic protein synthesis, as 8Œ≤-VE2 has been found to strongly induce expression of IGF-1 in the rat levator ani muscle.

Beyond human collaboration, advances in information and communications technologies, artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, and cyber physical systems have enabled cyber-supported collaboration in highly distributed organizations of people, robots, and autonomous systems. The fundamental premise of CCT is: Without effective augmented collaboration by cyber support, working in parallel to and in anticipation of human interactions, the potential of emerging activities such as e-Commerce, virtual manufacturing, telerobotics, remote surgery, building automation, smart grids, cyber-physical infrastructure, precision agriculture, and intelligent transportation systems cannot be fully and safely materialized. CCT addresses the challenges and emerging solutions of such cyber-collaborative systems, with emphasis on issues of computer-supported and communication-enabled integration, coordination and augmented collaboration. CCT is composed of eight design principles: (1) Collaboration Requirement Planning (CRP); (2) e-Work Parallelism (EWP); (3) Keep It Simple, System (KISS); (4) Conflict/Error Detection and Prevention (CEDP); (5) Fault Tolerance by Teaming (FTT); (6) Association/Dissociation (AD); (7) Dynamic Lines of Collaboration (DLOC); (8) Best Matching (BM).  Cyber-Supported Collaboration  = Levels = Collaboration is an essential means for effective design and control of e-Work. It enables all the entities involved in a decentralized system to share their resources, information, and responsibilities, such that mutual benefits are obtained and sustained. The level of collaboration, however, may vary from minimal information sharing, to fully collaborative networks. Often the terms ‚Äúcoordination‚Äù, ‚Äúcooperation‚Äù, and ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù are used interchangeably; but even though they are closely related, they do exhibit significant differences: * Coordination: Involves the use of communication and information exchange to reach mutual benefits among parties by working harmoniously. * Cooperation: Involves all the aspects of coordination as well as a resource-sharing dimension to support goal achievement. Cooperation commonly exhibits a division of labor component among all participants, and therefore the aggregated value is the result of adding the ‚Äúindividuals‚Äù parts. * Collaboration: Involves sharing of information, resources and responsibilities among all parties to jointly plan, implement, and assess the set of activities required to achieve a common goal, thus jointly creating added value. = Types = Collaboration may take place in one or a combination of the forms: * Mandatory collaboration: Two or more entities (e.g., agents; robots) must simultaneously process a task together. * Optional collaboration: One entity is sufficient for processing a task; however, another entity can contribute to processing the given task. * Concurrent collaboration: Two (or more) entities process certain portions of the same task, such that the overall task is completed in parallel.  CCT Design Principles  The following eight CCT principles have been defined, validated and implemented through cyber systems with algorithms, protocols, and multi- agent software systems in diverse industrial, production, supply and service installations, networks, and facilities. = Collaboration Requirement Planning (CRP) = CRP includes two phases for: (1) Detailed requirement planning of how, when, and with whom to collaborate (CRP-I) based on the objectives and available resources; (2) Real-time execution and revision of plans (CRP-II) to meet spatial and temporal challenges, changes, and constraints. Future extensions need to incorporate methods such as robust optimization, fuzzy logic, machine learning, and real-time optimization to further enable real-time changes and learning. The effective implementation of this principle requires both advanced and adaptive real-time planning in order for the cooperation and collaboration efforts to be fruitful and efficient. revision = e-Work Parallelism (EWP) = EWP implies that the activities and interactions in cyber and physical workspaces can and must be allowed to run in parallel. That is, systems cannot be constrained by sequential/linear tasks. The implications of the EWP principle span various human/software spaces and activities including human-human, human-computer, and machine- machine interactions. EWP defines the degree of parallelism as the level of resources/activity parallelism required to balance the tradeoff between the communication, transportation, and equipment costs, as well as the gained productivity. EWP also addresses the design and implementation of collaborative problem-solving, decision-support systems, and co-X tools, where ‚Äúco-‚Äù implies coordinated, cooperative, and/or collaborative support concepts such as co-design and co-plan. = Keep It Simple, System (KISS) = KISS focuses on the human-computer/-automation usability design principles. In addition to the need for human interaction with the emerging systems that are typically complex and not well understood (in terms of their internal mechanisms) by their human users, imagine the additional workload, confusion, and cost when those systems keep changing. KISS is a central principle for effective collaborative e-Work. This principle states that systems must be as complex as needed in their cyber sides, as long as the e-Work support system is enabled to work autonomously, in parallel to and supportive of humans, and subject to the humans‚Äô inputs and instructions. At the same time, for the users, the system must be the simplest to comprehend and operate, in order to minimize the need for repeated and costly human retraining. = Conflict/Error Detection and Prevention (CEDP) = CEDP enables dynamic diagnosis, prognosis, and resolution of conflicts between entities in a collaborative e-Work space. CEDP implies that the larger the rate of interactions, the larger the number of active collaborating parties and thus the rates of conflicts and errors. A conflict is defined as the inconsistencies between the goals, plans, tasks, and activities of two or more individuals. An error, on the other hand, refers to any input, output, or intermediate result which does not meet the predefined specifications, expectations, or comparison objectives of a system. Errors and conflicts are different but related. The key difference is that an error may involve only one individual, while for a conflict to occur, at least two individuals must be involved. An error may cause a conflict (or a series of conflicts) and vice versa. CEDP consists of a set of functions for detecting existing errors/conflict, classifying the observation as an error or a conflict, determining the exact point of error/conflict in the system, determining the type, magnitude, time, and cause of the out-of-control status, analyzing, predicting, and preventing propagation of the error/conflict, mitigating the negative effects of the error/conflict, and handling exceptions (constructive deviations from the process). = Fault Tolerance by Teaming (FTT) = FTT addresses fault- tolerant, feed-forward collaborative control of distributed processes. The goal of the FTT principle is to enable better efficiency and reliability from a network of weak agents (e.g., micro- and nano-sensors) rather than a single strong agent. FTT implies that an optimized team of collaborative agents generally yields better results compared to more powerful but individual agents. The latter may fail, and without backup, the system risks failure. The reliability and availability of system is improved through application of multiple redundant agents. Fault tolerance relates to the structure of a collaborative e-Work system. The combination of the FTT and CEDP principles extend into resilience by teaming frameworks that enable the formation, re- configuration, and operation of e-Work systems via ‚Äúdisruption-prone agents‚Äù that achieve higher resilience than an equivalent system of ‚Äúflaw-less/more reliable‚Äù agents. = Association/Dissociation (AD) = AD addresses dynamic variations in the formation, topology, size, and/or operations of collaborative systems such as enterprise alliances; self-organizing agent teams; sensor clusters; modular systems, and others. The AD principle analyzes the conditions and timing for individual/teams of agents to associate with or dissociate from a collaborative network. The AD decisions are made at different levels in the entire network, by individual agents, sub-networks or clusters of agents, or among multiple net-works. The analysis includes several phases, from creation and execution to dissolution and support. Some generic AD decisions include: When and why should to join a network? What are the benefits/costs of participating in a network? Why would an individual opt to remain in a network? What are the criteria to characterize and evaluate the performance of a network? The AD principle can be analyzed at the overall collaborative network level, at the individual/organization level, or at the sub-/multi-network level. The analysis may include various phases of the individual/organization/network lifecycle, from design to creation, activity, dissolution, and support. = Dynamic Lines of Collaboration (DLOC) = DLOC addresses the dynamic nature of collaborative networks, including emergency situations and the volatility of formal and informal communications between the individual and clustered agents. DLOC finds adjustments when networks evolve and undergo gradual changes over time. Specifically, successful realization of the previous design principles depends on the efficiency of the established lines of collaboration. The DLOC principle enables effective decision-making in complex and dynamic environments when they are being challenged or forced to change, sustainable information exchange and knowledge creation despite emergency/evolution, and optimal control of the emergent networks. An emergent network is a network that evolves through adding or removing nodes (e.g., agents) and/or links (e.g., interaction, communication, collaboration). Emergent networks are defined as evolutionary mechanisms of interaction which build upon the well-established theories of organizational learning and that are characterized by ad hoc decisions, effective improvisation, on-the-spot creation of contacts, and best-matching protocols for pairing system alerts with decisions, decision-makers, and the executors of the decisions. = Best Matching (BM) = BM implies that an e-Work system with a system with ‚Äúmismatched‚Äù individuals is always outperformed by an equivalent system with ‚Äúbest-matched‚Äù individuals. The growing complexity and dynamic behavior of systems along with competitive and globalized markets have gradually transformed traditional centralized systems into distributed networks of e-Work systems. These systems, regardless of context and application, have a property in common: They all involve certain types of interactions (collaborative, competitive, or both) among their distributed individuals‚Äîfrom clusters of sensors and machines to complex networks of computers, intelligent robots, humans, and enterprises. Having this common property, such systems may encounter common challenges in terms of suboptimal interactions and thus poor performance, caused by potential mismatch between individuals. BM provides the PRISM taxonomy of best matching [12], a set of concepts, models, and frameworks for systematic analysis, taxonomy, analogical and structural assessment of matching processes, specification, modeling, and real-time optimization of matching processes in distributed manufacturing, supply, and service networks.  Emerging Thrusts  = Collaborative Intelligence = Lean management, smart interactions with remote, global participants for set-up, development, and follow-up. = Service-Oriented Manufacturing = Manufacturing-as-a-service, effective integration and distribution of resources on the cloud. = Resilience = Handling uncertainty, preventing and recovering from errors and conflicts by effective teaming, enhancing manufacturing, supply, energy, and transportation infrastructure security. = Security and Information Assurance = Preventing and eliminating any conceivable errors, failures, and conflicts, and sustaining critical continuity of operations, assuring information and managing risks associated with the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information. = Integrated Factory Intelligence = Learning, adaptation, and evolution mechanisms, bio-inspired heterarchical control of distributed manufacturing networks and shop-floor devices. = Real-time Data-driven Predictive Technologies = Dynamic, adaptive, and data-driven analysis and decision-making methodologies.

Her family was a remarkable assembly. Her mother, Mabel, known as 'Beldy', Hardy made fabric genre scenes that were displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and Jeu de Paume in Paris. Mable was the daughter of Heywood Hardy, an English painter noted for his hunting scenes. Heywood's maternal grandfather was Sir William Beechey, a noted portrait artist, and father to no less than three painters. Daphne's sister Clarisse was also a painter. Her sister Cynthia was a dancer traveling with Alexander Sakharoff. Charles Maugham was also the brother of both the exiled British writer, W.

Life in England and France Daphne Maugham initially studied painting in Paris, attending the Academie Rason, directed by Nabis artists Paul S√©rusier and Maurice Denis. She then studied from 1918 to 1921 at the Accademie Notre-Dame des Champs with Cubist painter Andre Lhote. There she met the painter Mela Munter and Berthe Morisot. In 1914, she exhibited at the Galerie Druet of Paris, and in 1921, she was accepted at the Salon d‚ÄôAutomne. After this, she graduated in 1922 from the Slade School of Fine Art in London. Daphne's sister had begun dancing in Italy, and traveled to Turin in 1925 where she was performing at the Teatro Gualino, patronized by the industrialist Ricardo Gualino. This led to encounter with Felice Casorati, with whom he began taking classes. They would marry by 1931 and have one son, Francesco. Among the other women in Casorati's orbit were Paola Levi Montalicini, Giorgina Lattes and Nella Marchesini. In 1926, she exhibited at the Esposizione delle vedute of Turin organized by the Societ√† di Belle Arti Antonio Fontanesi. In 1928, she exhibited at the Promotrice of Turin. Over the next decade she would participate in numerous exhibitions, including at the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh, at the Quadriennali di Roma, and at the Biennale of Venice starting in 1928. With her husband, they fostered diverse intellectual salons in Turin, attended by Lionello Venturi, Giacomo Debenedetti, Carlo Levi, Mario Soldati, Giacomo Noventa, among others.Notes for exhibition of Solo Donna by Gianfranco Schialvino in the city of Bra in 2011, page 122.

Hobson's Pledge is a lobby group in New Zealand that was formed in late September 2016 to oppose alleged \\"MƒÅori favouritism\\". It is named after William Hobson, the first Governor-General of New Zealand and co- author of the Treaty of Waitangi. Background The group is led by former National Party and ACT leader Don Brash, who delivered the controversial Orewa Speech in 2004 on the allegation of MƒÅori privilege. Other key members include the legal academic David Round and the businessman Peter Shirtcliffe. Hobson's Pledge advocates abolishing the allocated MƒÅori seats in the New Zealand Parliament and the Waitangi Tribunal, eliminating affirmative action, and affirms that the MƒÅori tribes ceded sovereignty under the terms of the Treaty of Waitangi. Hobson's Pledge has been criticised by several prominent New Zealand personalities including broadcaster Willie Jackson and former Labour Party leader Andrew Little. Former Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei said of the campaign that it \\"failed in the old days and is going to fail now\\", referring to Brash's 2004 speech. Then-Prime Minister John Key likened the ideas of the group to tactics used by Donald Trump in his presidential campaign. In May 2018, Hobson's Pledge sponsored citizens-initiated local body referendums opposing the establishment of MƒÅori wards in Palmerston North, Western Bay of Plenty, Whakatane, Manawatu, and Kaikoura. Local councils in those districts had voted to establish MƒÅori wards. In response, Hobson's Pledge sponsored various individuals including Don Esslemont who organised citizen-initiated petitions opposing the MƒÅori wards. This took advantage of the Local Electoral Act 2001 that allows a referendum to be held on MƒÅori wards or constituencies if requested by a petition signed by 5% of the electors of a city, district, or council. As a result of these petitions, MƒÅori wards were rejected in local referendums held in Palmerston North (68.8%), Western Bay of Plenty (78.2%), Whakatane (56.4%), Manawatu (77%), and Kaikoura (55%) on 19 May 2018. In all five local referendums, the turnout was about 40%. The results were welcomed by Hobson's Pledge leader Don Brash and conservative broadcaster Mike Hosking. However, the results were met with dismay by WhakatƒÅne Mayor Tony Bonne, Labour MPs Willie Jackson and Tamati Coffey, former MƒÅori Party co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell, Bay of Plenty resident and activist Toni Boynton, and left-wing advocacy group ActionStation national director Laura O'Connell Rapira. ActionStation organised a petition calling on the Government to amend the Local Electoral Act's provisions on MƒÅori wards.

His works are frequently used as illustrations for articles and in books on the Danish colony. He was the brother of Peter von Scholten, Governor-General of the islands from 1827 to 1848. Biography Frederik von Scholten was born in Copenhagen, the son of Casimir Wilhelm von Scholten and Cathrine Elizabeth von Scholten (n√©e de Moldrup). The family moved to St. Thomas where his father served as governor. Frederik von Scholten was sent to the US to complete his schooling and from 1808 attended the Royal Naval Officers Academy in Copenhagen. He then travelled widely, first as a member of naval expeditions to the Mediterranean and the Danish West Indies in 1815 to 1817, then to France in 1818 and Iceland in 1820, then to Germany, Italy and France in 1821 to 1824 and finally in French service around the world on the naval ship La Favorite in 1829 to 1831. He visited the Danish West Indies again in 1833 and settled permanently as a customs inspector in Frederiksstad on St. Croix from 1834. In 1837, he visited Venezuela. Works Frederik von Scholten collected his drawings and watercolours in two sketch books with a total of 163 works from the period 1821-46. They are now part of the collection of the Danish Maritime Museum. He has also made a drawing of lieutenant H.A. Raupach (1833) and a plan drawing of Butlers Bay (watercolour, 1833, National Museum). Two other works, a water colour entitled View East from B√ºlowsminde (1834) and the Frederiksted, are now kept in the National Museum of Denmark.

After serving in the Army, he protested the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and with the American Civil Liberties Union, he sued an airport for his right to hand out copies of the U.S. Constitution in protest of Transportation Security Administration policies. On October 22, 2017, Stanton resigned from the Libertarian Party, citing concerns of white nationalism within his state affiliate. Army service Stanton joined the Army after the September 11 attacks in 2001. He served in the United States Army for six years, including a tour of duty in Iraq. His experiences with war helped shape his views on politics. He became an advocate for peace, and in 2012, after meeting Gary Johnson, he joined the Libertarian Party. Airport lawsuit In 2010 the Transportation Security Administration began to use full body scanners in their screening process for airline passengers. These scanners produced what looks like a nude image of the person being scanned. Opting out of these scanners required a new, more aggressive patdown. Stanton decided to protest these measures by handing out copies of the U.S. Constitution and other materials in the Fort Wayne International Airport. However, the airport's policy stated that he would have to stand in a specific place outside the terminal and would have to apply for a permit, to be approved by the executive director of the airport authority, at least seven days in advance in order to protest. As a result, Stanton and the American Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit against the Fort Wayne ‚Äì Allen County Airport Authority, claiming that this policy violates First Amendment rights to free speech. A federal judge ruled that airports were a nonpublic forum, meaning free speech could be limited for the general feeling of safety, stating that the Authority's right to amend constitutional free speech law \\"is related to the protection of its interests in maintaining a secure environment, reducing congestion, ensuring the free and orderly flow of pedestrian traffic.\\" The airport later changed its rules to allow free speech in more areas, and by 2013 the TSA had replaced the unpopular nude-image full body scanners with less-invasive scanners. 2016 Senatorial campaign In 2016 Stanton began his campaign for U.S. Senate as a Libertarian, taking part in the first ever Libertarian Party Senate primary in Florida. He defeated his opponent, attorney Augustus Sol Invictus, with 73.5% of the vote. Stanton then faced incumbent Senator Marco Rubio (R) and Congressman Patrick Murphy (D) in the general election. Stanton has said he hoped the Presidential campaign of Gary Johnson would bring more attention to his run for Senate. Stanton has polled at 10% and 9% in three-way polls conducted by Public Policy Polling in September 2016. According to Brian Doherty of Reason magazine, this could have placed Stanton in at least one televised debate. Stanton lost the election, finishing third with roughly 2% of the vote. Political positions Stanton will propose to cut taxes for companies with less than $500,000 in revenue completely, and work to reduce taxation for all businesses as much as possible. He supports the immediate decriminalization of all drugs, and the end of mandatory-minimum sentencing for drug-related offenses. Stanton advocates eliminating FICA taxes for all workers under the poverty line and believes direct charitable help to the poor should be encouraged, and that this can be done by instituting a dollar-for- dollar tax rebate for charitable donations. He advocates a complete and full audit of the Federal Reserve, and will oppose all efforts to provide weapons to foreign governments and insurgent groups. He has stated that he wants to help fix environmental problems in Florida by ending subsidies to the Big Sugar industry.

In this research, Olaniyan explored pop culture while trying to depict the state's \\"elite\\" cultural aspects. His research encompassed music, architecture, literature and political cartooning. Understanding how the State influences these practices helps in composing a cultural biography of the postcolonial African State. His larger goal was to resolve the social crisis through increased understanding.  Works  = \\"Uplift the Race!\\" = \\"Uplift the Race\\" is an in-depth look at films such as Coming to America and Do the Right Thing. This article discusses this idea of 'uplifting the race' and how the portrayal of this appears in films. The article begins with a quote from Eddie Murphy who basically says the white majority has created a system in which powerful black men feel the need to whisper 'white' in their own office. Olaniyan then discusses a quote from Michael Foucault that describes the situation Murphy talks about in his quote. Olaniyan quotes Paul Rabinow from \\"Representations Are Social Facts: Modernity and Post modernity in Anthropology\\" on the power of representation. Olaniyan states that Rabinow is saying \\"To be in control of (the means of) representation is therefore, to be in a position of power: that is, to be in control of the production, promotion, and circulation of subjectivities\\". Olaniyan finds it interesting that in popular opinion, both films failed do that. He discusses how Coming to America 'others' the African people. First, he discusses how the forest and house scenes support this exoticized idea of Africa. He suggests that the film shows Hollywood's idea of Africa's 'civilized' culture. He discusses the role of black women, claiming that they are the \\"scenery\\". He then discusses how Coming To America freezes African culture in a \\"one-dimensional frame\\" whereas Do the Right Thing gives its audience an unexpected and unapologetic view. Lee displays three- dimensional characters. In the end, Lee fails because he loses sight of the goal of 'uplifting the race'. Olanyian says that they both failed due to their representations of women. He felt that both failed to see the intersectionality of gender and race, therefore not uplifting the race.  Terms  *Racial Subjectification ‚Äì A state in which others see one individual as having no use. The subjectified individual is viewed as not having value to add to the lives of those around them, nor to society as a whole. Olanyian uses this term throughout \\"Uplift the Race!\\", when speaking about the subjectification of colored individuals. In that context, racial subjectification can be understood as the concept that people of color can be, and have been granted a status as equal subjects in society in relation to white Americans, but if they are seen as nothing more than just subjects, than they are without instrumental worth. This term is instrumental throughout Olanyian's discussion of the racial divide and the questioning of racial uplift. *Race/Racial Uplift ‚Äì A description of the responses of black leaders, activists and spokespersons to the racial discrimination marked by the assault on civil and political rights of African Americans. Many of these leaders feel a need to defend the good intent and honor of African Americans, while also countering negative black stereotypes. Olanyian mentions race uplift throughout \\"Uplift the Race\\" and questions why it is a favorable mode of response to racial subjectification. The author questions why race uplift is 'privileged' as a response to the unequal power relations in America. In Olanyian's discussion of Coming To America and Do The Right Thing, he presents the idea that racial uplift can actually lead to 'othering' of African Americans. *Othering ‚Äì Othering is defined by wordnik.com as \\"the process of perceiving or portraying someone or something as fundamentally different or alien.\\" It is an egocentric viewpoint in which a person sees themselves at the heart of society and the different or others to be less-important and less- connected to the group. This undermines social progress. Olanyian discusses othering, claiming that racial uplift others the African Americans it is trying to help by dividing them from their leaders. *Coevalness ‚Äì Multiple things of the same time, duration or age. The purpose of coevalness is to provide authenticity, acknowledgment that something does exist. *Appropriation ‚Äì Bell hooks states that appropriation violates another culture by creating a \\"fake\\" or a cheap imitation therefore always falling second to the original. Olaniyan says that appropriation denies the native \\"other\\" and denies coevalness in the sense that it establishes an authoritative idea (a \\"dominant gaze\\"). This poses the questions of whose ideas are dominant and therefore more important. Furthermore, whether this dominant idea provides a fair representation and whether the author's word dilutes the idea's authenticity. *Power of Representation ‚Äì This power comes from the ability to create one's own reality. Participation enables original constructions and better understanding of the result. Furthermore, participants can create their own reality. Controlling one's representation is a position of power. The power conferred by controlling representation is transformed into a metaphorical and symbolic domination.

Both Indonesian diversity and history add to complexity on defining and identifying what is Indonesian art. Visual art =Painting= Traditional Balinese painting depicting cockfighting Prehistoric cave paintings were discovered in numbers of sites in Indonesia. The notable ones are those in caves of Maros Regency in South Sulawesi, also in Sangkulirang- Mengkalihat karst formation in East Kutai and Berau Regency in East Kalimantan.

The art of painting is quite well-developed in Bali, where its people are famed for their artistry. The Balinese art paintings tradition started as classical Kamasan or Wayang style visual narrative, derived from East Javanese visual art discovered on East Javanese candi bas reliefs. Balinese painting tradition is notable for its highly vigorous yet refined intricate art which resembles baroque folk art with tropical themes. Ubud and Butuan in Bali are well known for their paintings. Numbers of painter artists have settled in Bali, which in turn developed the island into a world's artists enclave. Balinese painting is also a sought-after collection or souvenir for visitors in Bali. Modern Indonesian paintings were pioneered by Raden Saleh, a 19th-century Arab-Javanese painter renowned for his romantic-naturalistic work during Dutch East Indies period in Indonesia.

Between the 8th to 15th century, Javanese civilization has developed a refined stone sculpting art and architecture which was influenced by Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilization. The celebrated example is the temples of Borobudur and Prambanan. The Shailendra reign of Medang Mataram has produced multiple temples also with its refined sculpture of Hindu and Buddhist deities. Fine example includes the Buddhas image of Borobudur with its serene expression, Vairocana flanked by Padmapani and Vajrapani in Mendut temple, also Hindu pantheon of Shiva Mahadewa, Brahma, Vishnu, Ganesha, Durga, Agastya and Nandi in Prambanan temple compound. The Prajnaparamita of Java is a masterpiece of Javanese classical Hindu-Buddhist art, created in 13th century Singhasari, East Java. The art of wood carving is quite well-developed in Indonesia.

VCIC is aligned with the Golden Quadrilateral and is poised to play a critical role in driving India‚Äôs Act East Policy and Make in India campaign. The nearly 800-kilometer corridor links India with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asian economies that form the bedrock of global manufacturing economy. The corridor traverses nine districts of the state of Andhra Pradesh. VCIC intends to complement the ongoing efforts of the Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) to enhance industrial growth and create high quality jobs. VCIC supports Government of India (GOI)'s strategy to develop industrial corridors of international standards for expanding its manufacturing and services sectors, and creating modern urban centers connected by state-of-the-art infrastructure. GOI has selected the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as the lead partner for developing the ECEC, which will run from Kolkata to Kanyakumari, encompassing the four states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and West Bengal. Due to its vast scope, ECEC is being implemented in a phased manner, with VCIC as the first phase. The conceptualization and development of VCIC has received major support from ADB, which carried out analytical work determining the kind of infrastructure and institutional investments necessary to drive manufacturing- led growth in consultation with the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, GOI.  Background  While India has seen a rapid structural transformation and achieved strong economic growth for the past two decades, it must continue to create economic opportunities for its large labor force, which is increasing by about 12 million a year, to sustain economic growth and realize its demographic dividend. One pressing policy challenge is to create more productive and well-paying jobs in the manufacturing sector, which contributes about 16% to gross domestic product (GDP) and 12% to employment each year. By comparison, the manufacturing sectors of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Viet Nam account for nearly 25% or more of GDP.  VCIC as a Critical Component of India‚Äôs Coastal Corridor Development  VCIC‚Äôs long coastline and strategically located ports allow development of multiple international gateways to connect India with global value chains (GVCs) in Southeast and East Asia. VCIC aligns with the national objectives of expanding the domestic market and supports India‚Äôs port-led industrialization strategy (Sagar Mala initiative). While India‚Äôs trade with East and Southeast Asia has increased at a rapid pace in the past decade, the bulk of this trade is done through the ports on the country‚Äôs west coast. This is largely due to lack of efficient transport networks linking the production clusters in northern and central India to ports on the east coast, and insufficient container capacities at the ports to handle the volume of trade flowing to East and Southeast Asia.  VCIC Development Strategy  The strategy to develop VCIC is part of the plan to achieve accelerated development and regional industry agglomeration in the focus state. Regional industry agglomeration could be achieved by attracting companies in the value chain of other companies already based in the corridor, attracting particular industries that the corridor provides with geographical advantages, or building and maintaining advanced infrastructure to support industries.  Industrial Transformation in VCIC  The objective of industrial transformation is to increase the manufacturing sectors, improve labor productivity, and enhance international competitiveness. To achieve these objectives, it is necessary to identify the right set of industries for promotion. A detailed analysis identified these industries: pharmaceuticals, auto and auto components, textiles, metallurgy, chemicals and petrochemicals, food processing, and electronics. Besides identifying the right set of industries, connectivity infrastructure, logistics facilities, urban connectivity, and skilled manpower availability emerge as the key success factors from benchmarking globally successful industrial hubs. On the software side, regulations and their implementation mechanisms are critical for realizing the full economic potential of any industrial corridor.  Industrial Nodes in VCIC  Industrial nodes are an integral component of economic corridor development. When equipped with comprehensive infrastructure support and a business-friendly environment, nodes can serve as hubs geared to cradle industries. Through a node selection process, four industrial nodes were identified: # Visakhapatnam Node # Machilipatnam Node # Donakonda Node, and # Yerpedu-Srikalahasti Node  Infrastructure Development in VCIC  The node-based industrialization strategy targets to achieve regional and global competitiveness. Infrastructure development is one of the most important levers needed to attain this core objective. The focus has been on assessing the current state of infrastructure, both in terms of quantity and quality across categories, and identifying critical capacity gaps and other issues. GoAP in November 2017 introduced a legislative bill pertaining to the development of industrial corridors across the state. The bill established a new Andhra Pradesh Industrial Corridor Development Authority (APICDA) as the nodal body headquartered at the new state capital of Amaravati to implement the industrial corridor projects. The chief minister heads the new authority and the minister for industries minister is its member-secretary. An executive committee is to be constituted and a commissioner appointed as the nodal officer to manage the APICDA‚Äôs activities and oversee its functioning. The authority will look into development of nodes as part of the Visakhapatnam- Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC) and Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor (CBIC). Main functions of the board is to procure, acquire and have landholdings within the node. It will take up the planning, development, operation, maintenance, management and regulation of industrial corridors in the state. The authority will take up developing master plans in the nodes, facilitate investments. It may also raise funds from market, levy user charges directly or indirectly through any private sector participant. The authority will also have powers to float special purpose vehicles.  Institutions and Regulations in VCIC  Beyond investments in physical infrastructure, the regulatory framework needs to be changed to improve the investment climate and provide ease of logistics. This can be done by implementing technology; providing single window clearance; reducing burden of inspections for starting, operating and closing business; as well as easing logistical burden of industries by providing integrated check posts and bringing in uniformity on entry taxes and documentation. In July 2018, Andhra Pradesh, with a score of 98.42 per cent, topped the \\"ease of doing business\\" ranking among Indian states prepared by the World Bank and the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP). In the prior year, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana had jointly topped the same rankings. Parameters for the rankings include construction permit, labor regulation, environmental registration, access to information, land availability, and single window system. DIPP collaborates with the World Bank in conducting an annual reform exercise for all states and union territories under the Business Reform Action Plan.  Managing urbanization in VCIC  Industrialization and urbanization have generally proceeded together in developing economies. However, many new industrial locations in India failed to have planned urban developments including housing, and as a result, haphazard development has mushroomed around these locations. VCIC aims to synchronize industrialization and urbanization to prevent scattered industrialization and haphazard urban development by providing adequate physical and social infrastructure in urban centers to meet workers‚Äô quality- of-life needs. Model developments such as Sri City in Andhra Pradesh and the Dholera Special Investment Region in Gujarat offer a way forward in reconciling urbanization and industrial development.  VCIC to Promote Regional Integration  Most Asian economies ‚Äì particularly Southeast Asia and East Asia ‚Äì have grown by trading with their neighbors. By contrast, South Asia still lags behind in trading with its neighbors. In fact, South Asia has remained one of the least economically integrated regions in the world. In 2015, while intraregional trade of East Asia and ASEAN amounted to $2,837 billion and $564 billion, respectively, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries traded a merely $49 billion worth among each other. SAARC‚Äôs trade with other regions has also remained limited. For instance, SAARC exported about $177 billion to East Asia, which amounts to only a sixth of ASEAN‚Äôs exports to the same region. It is expected that the various economic corridors being developed in the region ‚Äì especially VCIC ‚Äì will make trade easier by expanding land and maritime routes, and open a floodgate of economic activity. Ultimately, VCIC will be interconnected and evolve into a sub-regional corridor. The establishment of a regional corridor would lead to the reduction of barriers at national boundaries to enable the seamless movement of people and goods at least cost.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) Support for VCIC  The ADB approved on 20 September 2016 (i) a $500 million multi-tranche financing facility (MFF), and (ii) a $125 million policy-based loan (PBL), both to India for the Visakhapatnam‚ÄìChennai Industrial Corridor Development Program (VCICDP). The MFF will support priority infrastructure investments in the VCIC, and the PBL will support policy reforms and institutional development in the state. Master planning for the identified industrial nodes is currently being undertaken. The master plan for two prioritized nodes was prepared with ADB support and completed in June 2018. The master plan estimates an investment requirement of more than $2.8 billion over the next 5 years. ADB further provides support to the state government‚Äôs interactions with potential investors and in identifying anchor investors across key sectors in the two nodes.

PC Gamer gave it 64/100, calling it \\"[a]n often frustrating game built around a clever idea\\", and argued that the darkening of unsolved rooms makes \\"exploration [become] an exercise in feeling around in the dark, unsure if you're about to plunge down a hole into another room entirely, losing all your progress in the current room.\\" On a positive note, it also said \\"[t]he core idea of powering up your character progressively is a solid one, and there are moments of real beauty in the stark-but-cute art style\\", though wrote the game was too flawed as a whole to take full advantage of these ideas.

It is colloquially referred to as ghost snake. It was found in a lime rock formation.  Description  la' indicates infralabial scales Madagascarophis lolo can be identified from other species in its genus by its gray, overall body color with black vertebral stripe and dorsal, alternating lighter gray splotches. It has 25 midbody scale rows, 189 ventral scales and 56 divided subcaudal scales. With the exception of M. fuchsi, it differs from all other Madagascarophis species by having extended contact of posterior infralabial scales. M. lolo can be distinguished from M. fuchsi by its slightly lower number of infralabial scales, with M. lolo having around 10 infralabial scales to the approximately 12‚Äì13 infralabial scales of M. fuchsi.  Behavior  Alike other species of Madagascarophis, M. lolo is nocturnal.  Habitat  Ankarana Reserve karst in Ankarana National Park, the park in which, Madagascophis lolo was first sighted and documented. Their habitat is variable, as they are terrestrial and semi-arboreal, but mainly are found on karst rock formations. Researchers propose that the rarity of M. lolo sightings could be due to their rough terrain habitat, as the karst rock formations are difficult to navigate, especially in the night, when M. lolo would be active.  Distribution  Madagascarophis lolo is probably endemic to karst areas of Analamerana and Ankarana of Madagascar.  Etymology  Madagascarophis lolo gets its specific name lolo from the Malagasy word for \\"ghost\\". There are two reasons for this name, namely, the pale gray color of the ghost snake, and the elusiveness of the species relative to other species in an area of Ankarana that is relatively well explored.

It is a ground orchid with a single, densely hairy leaf and one or two white or pale yellow flowers with maroon tips. Formerly much more widespread, it is now only known from about two thousand individual plants in five locations in the Riverina area and is classed as \\"Endangered\\". Description Caladenia arenaria is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single underground tuber which is replaced annually. In late autumn or early winter a linear to narrow lance-shaped leaf is produced which is long, wide and reddish at the base. One or (rarely) two pale yellow to creamy-white flowers are borne on a hairy spike up to high. The dorsal sepal, lateral sepals and petals are up to long, held horizontally or slightly drooping and tapering to dark reddish, thread-like ends. The labellum is egg-shaped to heart-shaped, about long and wide with teeth up to but decreasing in size towards the front of the labellum. There are four to six rows of calli, shaped like golf stick heads on the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from late August to November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia arenaria was first formally described by Robert FitzGerald in 1882 and the description was published in his book, Australian Orchids. The specific epithet (arenaria) is a Latin word meaning \\"sandy\\". Distribution and habitat Sand-hill spider orchid grows in sclerophyll forest and on sandhills, usually under cypress pine trees. Its range used to extend for from Deniliquin to Yass and Mudgee but is now only known from five locations between Urana and Narrandera. Conservation Caladenia arenaria is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act and under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. Five populations with a total of about two thousand individual plants are known. Weeds, grazing and hybridisation with other orchid species are the main threats to the survival of this species.

The SOCP deals with all aspects of the conservation of the Critically Endangered Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) and the 2017 newly identified species of orangutan, the Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis), including: a. the confiscation of illegal captive orangutans, their quarantine and reintroduction to form new wild populations, b. education and awareness raising, c. behavioral and ecological research on wild orangutans, d. surveys and monitoring of remaining wild orangutan populations and habitat, and e. habitat protection. Activities Built in 2001, the SOCP maintains the only centre in Sumatra that quarantines and cares for orangutans confiscated from the illegal pet trade. To date, the SOCP has rescued over 340 illegal pet orangutans of which more than 260 have been rehabilitated and reintroduced back to a life in the wild, 180 at its reintroduction centre next to the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park in Jambi province and an additional 88 since 2011 at its centre in the Jantho Pine Forest Nature Reserve in Aceh province.

Talekar was an Indian soldier on guard duty at the Ashok Listening Post. All seven soldiers on duty from the 17 Maratha Light Infantry battalion were killed. Talekar was beheaded and his severed head was carried across the line of control. Biography of Talekar Talekar was a resident of Kolgaon village in Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, India. He was the son of daily laborers and had studied till the 10th grade before joining the army. He was unmarried and 24 years old at the time of his death. According to natives of his village, the family of Talekar did not knew that he was beheaded. The army declined the Talekar's sister request to see his face. His last rites were performed at his village. Incident In the early hours of 27 February 2000, a guerilla attack led by Ilyas Kashmiri and twenty-five HuJI terrorists was launched at the Ashok Lightening Post, Nowshehra sector in the Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir, India. The attack was covered by heavy mortar and rocket fire from Pakistani soldiers, which were dressed in black uniform and reported to be from Special Services Group. The Indian post is surrounded on all three sides by the Pakistani posts and is said to be an unfavorable position. Bhausaheb Maruti Talekar was on guard duty, and other seven soldiers of the 17 Maratha Light Infantry were in the bunker at the time of incident. Ilyas Kashmiri slit Talekar's throat and thereafter other terrorists accompanying him opened fire inside bunker in which all seven soldiers were killed. The head of Talekar was taken across the Line of Control in Pakistan by the terrorists and was brandished as a trophy before the public. According to Indian Army, Talekar was the first casualty of the attack. A captured terrorist revealed that they had played football with the head of Talekar. Pakistan denied that its soldiers were involved in the incident. Aftermath =Ilyas Kashmiri= Pakistani media published the photographs of Ilyas Kasmiri carrying the severed head of Talekar.

Ilyas Kashmiri, was killed in a US drone attack in 2011. =The inquiry against the commanding officer= The commanding officer of the unit was Colonel Sandes. He had communicated to the superiors seeking permission to shift the Ashok listening post because of the possibility of a sneaking attack such as the one which happened on the 27 February 2000, but he was denied permission. He faced a court of inquiry after the incident which exonerated him, but his superiors had reported that colonel Sandes was unfit for commanding a unit. The colonel had to fight a legal battle to be eligible for promotion. Sandes was promoted to the rank of Brigadier in 2010. =Talekar's memory= The army took up the responsibility of the education of his sister after the incident. His family continues to receive a pension of 10,000 per month. A sum of 12 lakh rupees was given to Talekar's family as compensation. In his memory, a community hall was built in his village. His sister is pursuing the hope to start a school for special children in his memory. =Similar incidents= During the Kargil War, Captain Saurabh Kalia of the Indian Army was captured by the Pakistani soldiers and later his dead body was handed back. Indian security officials allege that Saurabh Kalia's dead body was badly mutilated when they received it.

The test focuses on language proficiency, not operational procedures. ICAO Requirements for Language Proficiency With the implementation of the ICAO language proficiency requirements in 2011, the international aeronautical community took a significant step towards improving safety in aviation. Now all air traffic controllers and pilots operating in internationally designated airspace and on international air routes have to demonstrate their proficiency in the language(s) they have for aeronautical communication.ICAO Doc 9835 Manual on the Implementation of ICAO Language Proficiency Requirements In order to maintain the operational standard, air traffic controllers and pilots must achieve at least level 4 according to ICAO‚Äôs language proficiency requirements. Their language proficiency is a licence endorsement without which air traffic control and pilot licences cannot be issued.ICAO Annex 1 - Personnel Licensing (see 1.2.9 Language Proficiency and Appendix A - Language Proficiency Rating Scale) ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for Language Proficiency Requirements (LPR) - requires organisations worldwide to ensure that the language proficiency tests they work with are reliable, effective and appropriate for the aviation industry. ELPAC is the first English Language Proficiency test to achieve full ICAO recognition since 2012.ICAO Recognized tests Background ELPAC was developed by EUROCONTROL, in partnership with the Zurich University of Applied Sciences/ZHAW and ENOVATE A.S. (Bergen, Norway). It is designed to help Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP), Aircraft Operators (AO), National Supervisory Authorities (NSA) and training organisations (TO) meet the ICAO language proficiency requirements. ELPAC test development began in November 2004 following extensive feasibility studies. In February 2005 a core development team, consisting of air traffic controllers and English language experts from six countries and EUROCONTROL, began designing the test specifications and items/tasks in accordance with the ICAO language proficiency requirements.Second ICAO Aviation Language Symposium (IALS-2) - paper 22 ELPAC test design and structureELPAC Information leaflet p.7 ELPAC tests English language proficiency at ICAO level 4. (operational) and level 5 (extended) Both standard ICAO phraseology and plain language are included in the test. Plain language proficiency is an essential component of radiotelephony communications, as it is not possible to develop standard phraseologies to cover every conceivable situation. There are currently two versions of ELPAC available, which were designed specifically to reflect the communicative functions of air traffic controllers and commercial pilots. There are two papers, and candidates are required to successfully complete both: *Listening Comprehension (also referred to as ELPAC Paper 1) *Oral Interaction (also referred to as ELPAC Paper 2) ELPAC Paper 1 is administered via the Internet and takes around 40 minutes to complete. ELPAC Paper 2 is administered by two ELPAC examiners, a language expert and an operational expert, and takes around 20 minutes to complete. ELPAC for air traffic controllers ELPAC Paper 1 (Listening Comprehension) tests the understanding of communications between pilots and controllers and between controllers and controllers in both routine and non-routine situations. The recordings are based on authentic material and range from short standard pilot transmissions to longer communications in which the controller deals with non-routine or unusual situations. ELPAC Paper 2 (Oral Interaction) assesses the controller‚Äôs proficiency through non-visual and visual communication in three tasks. This includes: *The correct use of standard ICAO phraseology *Switching between structured phrases, standard ICAO phraseology and plain English *Making an appropriate response to a pilot message *Resolving misunderstandings *Dealing effectively with the relationship between pilot and controller *Negotiating a developing unusual situation *Making a verbal report in English (on an unusual non-routine situation) *Producing extended speech in an aviation context. ELPAC for pilots ELPAC Paper 1 (Listening Comprehension) tests the understanding of communications between pilots and controllers in both routine and non-routine situations. The recordings are based on authentic material and range from short standard pilot transmissions to longer communications in which the pilot deals with non-routine or unusual situations. ELPAC Paper 2 (oral Interaction) assesses the pilot‚Äôs proficiency through a series of different tasks. This includes: *switching between structured phrases and plain English *making an appropriate report on an unusual ATC-related event *resolving misunderstandings *effectively managing the relationship between pilot and controller *negotiating meaning *producing extended speech in an aviation context * Online language proficiency test ( Level4, Level5, Level6 ) for pilots in english or german ELPAC Level 6 Test for air traffic controllers and pilots The ELPAC level 6 test is available after the first series of language proficiency tests has been completed for organisations wishing to test their staff at ICAO level 6, which is referred to as ELPAC Paper 3. ELPAC Paper 3 (level 6 test) assesses the air traffic controller‚Äôs or pilot‚Äôs proficiency at ICAO level 6, verifying through four tasks that the candidate is able to: *understand and avoid idiomatic English *recognise and avoid ambiguity *use clear and concise English *negotiate meaning *clarify potential misunderstandings These requirements are in accordance with the ICAO rating scale description of a level 6 speaker. The ELPAC level 6 test can be taken only after the candidate has demonstrated ICAO level 5 first in the regular ELPAC test. Access ELPAC is currently available to Air Navigation Service Providers, Aircraft Operators, CAAs and Training Organisations worldwide subject to a Licence AgreementELPAC Licence Agreement with EUROCONTROL. ELPAC Preparation EUROCONTROL provides a set of online sample tests that can be used by ELPAC test candidates to familiarise themselves with the ELPAC test format and task types. *ELPAC Paper 1 sample test for air traffic controllers *ELPAC Paper 1 sample test for pilots This will make candidates feel more confident; however, it is the level of English language proficiency that determines the result of the ELPAC test.

Ch√¢teau de Pignerolle Construction Constructed in 1776 for the director of the equestrian academy in Angers, Marcel Avril de Pignerolle. Built in a neo- classic style with a four column frontage, it is 25m by 17m and lies in a park of 80 hectares. History =1939‚Äì1940= On 1 September 1939 Germany invaded Poland. On 2 September, the 125th Polish Infantry Regiment was formed at Pignerolle before going to fight on the Moselle. The Chateau was requisitioned by the Polish government-in-exile. The Polish General Staff settled into the Chateau. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raczkiewicz became Polish President in Exile on 30 September 1939 and lived at the Chateau of Pignerolles from 2 December 1939. Shortly after the outbreak of war, the Polish cryptologists, including Marian Rejewski were evacuated to France, where they continued breaking Enigma-enciphered messages working with the French and British code breakers. The Polish Government in Exile were located in nearby Angers. The battle for France which began on 10 May 1940 with the invasion of the low countries concluded on 22 June 1940. At the time there were numerous Polish military units in France by June 1940, with Polish personnel in the country totaling 80,000 men. The staff from Pignerolle were amongst the 24,352 Polish personnel evacuated as part of Operation Ariel to Great Britain before the Chateau was captured on 19 June and was requisitioned by the Wehrmacht on 8 July. The Polish cryptologists and their support staff resumed work undercover a few months later in Vichy France until the end of 1942. =1942‚Äì1944= Following the St Nazaire Raid on 28 March 1942 the German Navy, the commander of the Kriegsmarine, Erich Raeder decided the risk to certain units of seaborne attack was high and decided to relocate the western command centre for U-boats to Pignerolle. The Chateau was chosen as it was far enough from the sea to be safe, whilst the radio communications in the area were good as the land was very flat. Construction began on a command bunker, the same plans were used for the late 1943 bunker Koralle located in Germany 30 km from Berlin, it is three contiguous bunkers, with its 3m thick roof it covers 1,500 sq m, being 34m by 56m in size. With ten other concrete constructions and thirty wooden barracks being completed by 600 Organisation Todt workers starting in April 1942 and finishing in May 1943. The part buried main command bunker had teletype communications as well as 16 aerial masts on its roof to transmit and receive enigma coded messages with submarines in the Atlantic. R√∂sing (left) awards G√ºnther Heydemann with the Knight's Cross in July 1943. In Jul 1942 Hans-Rudolf R√∂sing was appointed as FdU West (F√ºhrer der Unterseeboote West) Pignerolle became his headquarters. He was responsible for the eight flotillas of boats committed to the Battle of the Atlantic, and thus a great majority of the entire U-boat fleet until autumn 1944. In February 1943 he was promoted to Fregattenkapit√§n, and one month later to Kapit√§n zur See. On 30 January 1943 Doenitz was appointed Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine in place of Grossadmiral Raeder. He visited the Chateau on a number of occasions including August 1943. All communications with U-Boats in the Atlantic were routed from Berlin through the Pignerolle command and communications centre. The park was used by up to 1,000 German submariners for rest, relaxation and training purposes. In case of an air raid, the men could shelter in bunkers that were designed as two story above ground air raid shelters. A 133m tunnel was constructed from the Chateau to the command bunker. The bunkers around the Chateau do not conform to the standardized Regelbau system. The Chateau received submariner visitors from Italy and Japan during 1944. The Germans departed on 9 August 1944, setting fire to the equipment in the main bunker. There is little evidence of aerial attacks on Pigerolle, possible because of the importance of intercepting enigma coded messages to submarines that could be decoded. On average 31 boats operated in any one month and of those, 16‚Äì17 disappeared per month, in total, 371 U-Boats were lost in the Battle of the Atlantic almost all whilst commanded from Pignerolle. 1945-date The barracks were used firstly by US troops then as a repatriation center until in January 1946 it housed 1,000 displaced people whose homes had been destroyed during the war, they continued in use until 1964. Listed as a national monument in 1961. Ch√¢teau de Pignerolles The command bunker was taken over by the French government as a reserve nuclear fallout center for President Charles de Gaulle during the Cold War era, moving to the ownership of the French Government in 1964. It is still not accessible to the public although several of the other bunkers have been opened to public viewing on occasions. Acquired by Angers in 1971, the park, gardens and Chateau were restored over the next 20 years. From 1992 until it closed in 2015 the Chateau was a museum dedicated to European communications from prehistoric times until the 20th-century. The gardens remain open to the public and occasional events are held in the park.

It is a ground orchid which grows singly or in loose groups and has a single, hairy leaf and one or two white to greenish-white flowers on a wiry, hairy stalk. The total population is thought to be between 2,000 and 4,500 and it is classed as an \\"Endangered\\" species. Description Caladenia argocalla is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy, linear to narrow lance-shaped leaf. The leaf is erect, long, wide and dull green. The leaf appears in April or May but leaves or flowers do not appear every year, the number of flowering plants fluctuating from year to year. One or two unscented flowers are borne on a wiry, hairy spike high. The flowers are about in diameter and are white or greenish-white with a narrow stripe along the sepals and petals. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide, linear to elliptic in shape but narrows to a thin, thread-like end about wide. The lateral sepals are long, about wide, egg-shaped to lance-shaped in the lower part but taper to a long thin thread-like end. The petals are long, about wide and have a similar shape to the sepals. The labellum is egg-shaped to heart-shaped, erect near its base but curves forward, especially towards its end. There are ten to twelve white or purplish calli up to long along the edges of the labellum and six to eight rows of red or white golf-club shaped calli in the centre and extending almost to the tip of the labellum. The column is long and transparent with reddish stripes and other shapes as well as broad wings. Flowering occurs from September to October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia argocalla was first formally described by David L. Jones in 1991 and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The type specimen was collected near Kapunda. The specific epithet (argocalla) is derived from the Ancient Greek words argos meaning \\"white\\" and kallos meaning \\"beautiful\\" in reference to the common name. Distribution and habitat White beauty spider orchid grows on hills and slopes in forest, usually with sheoaks. It is only known from thirteen subpopulations in the hills north of Adelaide, including in the Spring Gully Conservation Park. Conservation The total size of the population of this species in 2006 was estimated to be between 2,000 and 4,500 individuals. The main threats to its survival are considered to be habitat degradation, weed invasion, lack of pollinators and grazing by native, domestic and feral animals. It is classified as \\"Endangered\\" under the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 and the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act.

She served in the Legislative Yuan from 1996 to 2002. Chu and Hsu Hsin-liang formed an independent ticket in the 2000 presidential election, finishing third. Early life, education and career Chu, born in 1950, is of Mainlander descent. She received a Ph.D. in art and archaeology from Princeton University in 1990 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \\"The Chung Yu (A.D. 151-230) tradition: a pivotal development in Sung calligraphy.\\" She was then a research fellow at the National Palace Museum. Political career Chu served two terms in the Legislative Yuan, winning the 1995 and 1998 elections. Throughout her legislative career, she was occasionally covered in local media as a New Party politician, but most often as an independent. Chu and Hsu Hsin-liang formed an independent ticket in the 2000 presidential election, won by Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu. Chu ran for the Hsinchu district seat in the legislative elections of 2001 with the endorsement of the Gender Sexuality Rights Association, but lost. =Political stances= Chu has worked to expand LGBT rights in Taiwan, and has advocated for rights of foreign spouses. Chu backed efforts to maintain an unbiased media, as well as cultural outreach initiatives. To this end, she supported a proposal by the Taiwan Media Watch Foundation to have government workers barred from working in the media, and has criticized political interference in the Public Television Service. In 2001, she expressed support for expanding the National Palace Museum to southern Taiwan, a project that was not completed until 2015. When the United States government announced that it would not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, Chu sought a meeting with the American Institute in Taiwan to argue for the ratification of the treaty. In 2004, she criticized the Chen Shui-bian administration for backing a NT$610.8 billion proposal to acquire American weapons, saying that the results of the Cross-Strait referendum showed that most Taiwanese did not approve of the action. Later career After leaving politics, Chu taught at Taipei National University of the Arts. In 2009, she returned to the National Palace Museum as assistant director of educational outreach, assuming the departmental head position the next year.

She is best known for the Jem and the Holograms comic with co-creator and artist Sophie Campbell, a modern re-imagining of the 1980s cartoon of the same name, the Eisner-nominated Marvel comic Hawkeye with artist Leonardo Romero, which stars Kate Bishop, and Captain Marvel featuring Carol Danvers with artist Carmen Carnero and colorist Tamra Bonvillain. Her other works include A-Force, West Coast Avengers, The Girl Who Would Be King, Jessica Jones and Mr and Mrs X among others. Career Thompson stated she had \\"been writing in some way shape or form for about as long as [she] can remember.\\" Thompson graduated from the Savannah College of Art and Design with a degree in Sequential Art. She got her start in the comics industry as staff writer for the website CBR, where she worked from 2009 to 2015 writing reviews and her column called She Has No Head!, centered around women in comics. In 2012 she launched a kickstarter campaign for her first novel, The Girl Who Would Be King. The crowdfund campaign reached $26,478, 330% of its original goal, and was released in September of that same year. The story involves two girls with extraordinary powers, one who uses them for good, one for bad, who are about to meet for the first time. In 2014 the novel was optioned for a movie adaptation by Logan Pictures. Thompson told io9, \\"We had a lot of interest in the book. I think we had at least half a dozen legitimate companies inquiring about the rights. We also had some more intimate interest from writers and smaller producers, a couple film agents also came calling.\\" At the 2014 New York Comic Con, IDW Publishing revealed it had got the comic book license for the '80s rock-n-roll adventure cartoon Jem and the Holograms. A month later, IDW revealed that they hired Thompson to write the first Jem and the Holograms comic with artist Sophie Campbell, a modern re-imagining of the series. She wrote the comic for two years, with the first issue released in March 2015 and the ongoing concluding with issue #26 on June 14, 2017. During the 2015 \\"Secret Wars\\" storyline, she co-wrote her first Marvel comic, a four issue tie-in series titled Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps with Kelly Sue DeConnick. In 2016, Thompson and Brenden Fletcher wrote a spin-off six-issue Power Rangers mini-series titled Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Pink for Boom! Studios. The mini was focused on the Pink Ranger. She also wrote the solo series of Kate Bishop, the second Hawkeye. It follows Bishop, who opens her own detective company on the west coast of the United States. For her work on Hawkeye she was nominated for an Eisner for best continuing series in 2018. It was cancelled by Marvel after 16 issues in 2018. In January 2018, Marvel Comics announced it had signed Thompson to an exclusive contract. That same month, the first issue of Rogue & Gambit was released, which was announced ahead of New York Comic Con 2017. It follows Rogue and Gambit, who reignite their relationship while investigating the disappearance of mutants at a vacation resort. Following the success of Rogue & Gambit, the two characters got married in X-Men Gold #30 in a surprise twist. Initially the wedding was for the X-Men Kitty Pryde and Colossus, but according to X-Men Gold writer Marc Guggenheim Marvel changed their plans. After the wedding issue was released, the planned ongoing called Mr. and Mrs. X, also written by Thompson, was revealed to be about Rogue and Gambit as a married couple. She also wrote a five-issue Nancy Drew comic, which followed the titular character as a 17-year-old who has to return to the home she‚Äôd left behind and solve a mystery that involves childhood friends and someone who‚Äôs out to end Nancy's crime-fighting career permanently with her death. It was published by Dynamite. Starting that July, Thompson took over Jessica Jones from Brian Michael Bendis. Jessica Jones was the first line of 'digital original'-only titles, which were primarily focused on Marvel characters who have their own television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They were 40-page sized issues released every month over the course of three months, and were later released as physical trade paperbacks. In October 2018, it was announced she also would write the new ongoing of Captain Marvel featuring Carol Danvers with artist Carmen Carnero and colorist Tamra Bonvillain, the first issue of which was released on January 9, 2019 and sold more than a hundred thousand copies, Thompson's first comic to reach this milestone. Starting in March 2019, Thompson also wrote a new five-issue Sabrina the Teenage Witch mini for Archie Comics, which concluded in September of that same year. The miniseries was met with critical acclaim and it won 2019's IGN People's Choice award. She was also co-writer of the X-Men storyline \\"X-Men: Disassembled\\". In June 2019, Thompson joined the Shots Fired project to raise money to combat gun violence. The comic will be published by Comicker Press, and is scheduled to be released later this year after a successful Kickstarter funding campaign. The proceeds from the book's sale are going to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and the Community Justice Reform Coalition. That same month, the team responsible for the Captain Marvel ongoing was added to the first issue of the all-female Marvel Fearless anthology. The four-issue mini-series explores various female superheroes, including Invisible Woman, Storm, Captain Marvel, Millie the Model and Jessica Jones. Every issue is created entirely by women, including variant covers, and the first issue was released on July 24. Thompson was one of the writers on a Spider-Man story called Amazing Spider-Man: Full Circle #1. The comic follows Peter Parker, who goes on a globe-hopping adventure. It was released on October 23, 2019. =Awards= For her work on Hawkeye, Thompson was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series in 2018. A year later, she was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best writer for her work on Nancy Drew (Dynamite); Hawkeye, Jessica Jones, Mr. & Mrs. X, Rogue & Gambit, Uncanny X-Men and West Coast Avengers (Marvel).

Specifically, it is a way to recover the spatial coordinates and the rotation of the scanner without the use of any other sensors, i.e, extrinsic information.

First, a priori knowledge of the scanning instruments, and second, on sensor data overlap employing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods. The term was coined in.Lehtola, V.

Per 1 October 2016, 26,404 persons in Denmark were of Lebanese origin. Most Lebanese in Denmark belong to various Christian denominations (Maronite, Greek Orthodox, Melkite Catholic, Protestant), but there is also a sizable number of Muslims (Sunni and Shi'a) and also some Druze. Demographics Lebanese origin in Denmark by sex, yearly fourth quarter 2008-2017 (Statistics Denmark).

Most of that income comprises earned income, with the remainder consisting of public transfers, investment income and second income. As of 2017, a total of 11,464 persons of Lebanese origin in Denmark received public benefits. Of these individuals, the government funds were primarily allocated toward disability pension (3,687), the Danish State Education Grant and Loan Scheme Authority (2,990 persons), social benefits (2,782 persons), net unemployment (743 persons), subsidized employment (464 persons), guidance and activities upgrading skills (334 persons), maternity benefits (245 persons), job-based sickness benefits (195 persons), persons receiving holiday benefits (19 persons), and early retirement pay (6 persons). Employment According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2014, Lebanon-born immigrants aged 30-64 in Denmark have an employment rate of approximately 31.9%. Lebanon-born individuals aged 16-64 also have a self- employment rate of around 17%. Education According to the Danish Institute for Local and Regional Government Research, in the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Lebanese pupils constituted 10% of the student population in Denmark. They obtained PISA scores of 421 in mathematics (Matematik), 428 in reading (L√¶sning), 401 in science (Naturfag), and 422 in problem-solving (Problem-l√∏sning). Of the most frequent countries of origin for students examined by the PISA, these were among the lowest scores in all categories. As of the 2015 PISA, Lebanese pupils represent 9% of Denmark‚Äôs student population. Their scores have decreased in each of the examined PISA categories except math, scoring 399 in science (399 when unadjusted for socioeconomic status), 404 in reading (405 unadjusted), and 434 in mathematics (434 unadjusted). These PISA scores are generally in the lower range of the most frequent countries of origin for students.

Constructed in 1916, it is a prominent landmark at the intersection of Boonah-Rathdowney Road and Railway Street on the northern entry to Boonah. During the first part of the twentieth century, it was one of the most modern butter factories in the Commonwealth, the largest butter factory in the Southern Hemisphere, had the second highest output of butter in Queensland and was a major supplier of dairy products to Brisbane. The former Boonah Butter Factory office, which is currently the premises of Flavours Cafe, is on the Local Heritage Register of the Scenic Rim Regional Council in acknowledgement of the site's historic, aesthetic and cultural significance. The Boonah Butter Factory is the sole surviving cream factory or butter factory in Boonah and is one of the most historic buildings in the region.Open Studios Boonah & Kalbar . Visit Scenic Rim. Scenic Rim Regional Council. Retrieved 16 October 2016. It has served as a studio and gallery space for local and international artists for over twenty years and has been identified by the Scenic Rim Regional Council as a developed attraction in the region. The former loading platform for the factory is a fruit and vegetable store. The factory was an essential industry in the region. It was a gauge for the progress of the district, responsible for the generation and supply of electrical power to Boonah and responsible for pumping water to tanks throughout the township to assist in fighting fires. It is the first of two dairy factories known to have been designed, in part, by Thomas Ramsay Hall of the architectural firm T.R. Hall and Phillips and is the only one to remain in situ. The second factory designed by T.R. Hall was constructed in 1936 for the South Coast Co-Operative Dairy Association in Southport and was demolished in 1972 to make way for the Australia Fair Shopping Centre. The Boonah Butter Factory is one of the four original factories managed by the Queensland Farmers Co-Operative Association, including those located at Grantham, Laidley and Booval. Boonah Butter Factory, 1959 History A load of cream cans bound for the Boonah Butter Factory, 1932 Boonah Butter Factory, 1932 Creameries had an important role in the establishment of the early dairy industry in the region and made a significant contribution to the prosperity and economic stability of Boonah which was one of the earliest areas settled by Europeans after the establishment of Brisbane. In conjunction with local cheese factories like the Trelawney Cheese Factory, which is listed on the Scenic Rim Regional Council Local Heritage Register as a rare example of early dairy technology, they were extremely beneficial to the district. The former office building is now a cafe The first creamery in Boonah was built by the Central Dairy Company in the vicinity of the current site of the Boonah Butter Factory around 1894. The factory was located across the railway tracks from the township on the hill behind the school ground with the seven and a half acre site 200‚Äì300 foot above Boonah offering panoramic views of the countryside. The factory was designed and managed by Samuel Dover who had experience in the industry. Milk from local dairy farmers was delivered to the factory, processed into cream and then transported via rail to the large factories in Brisbane for churning into butter. The residue from the separation of the milk was used as a food source for pigs, which were also an important agricultural industry in the region. By January 1895, the already successful creamery had been sold to the Lowood Creamery Company which was owned by Howes Bros. and Co. The Boonah Creamery was one of a number of factories in the district owned by the Lowood Creamery Company with other creameries located at Engelsberg, Milford, Rosevale and Anthony. Despite the success of the creameries, the local farmers wished to have greater control of their own dairy products and pricing. Rather than transport the cream to Brisbane for final processing where the vibration of the train journey could impact the quality, the farmers wished to churn butter in Boonah. There was also a strong desire to remove their reliance on privately owned factories and participate in the cooperative movement in the dairy industry that was gaining momentum in Queensland. To achieve this, a local butter factory operated as a cooperative venture was required. Despite growing dissatisfaction with the privately owned dairy enterprises, the early factories of the dairy industry encouraged a proactive approach from farmers to improve the yield and quality of the region's milk products. The agricultural and dairy success of the area was directly linked to the community's ability to lobby for land to be set aside for the Boonah Showgrounds in order to hold an Agricultural show to showcase the district's produce and reinforce community spirit. The designer and manager of the creamery, Samuel Dover, was the first secretary of the newly formed Fassifern and Dugandan Pastoral and Agricultural Show Society. The first Boonah Show was held in 1898. Site Rooftop, 2016 The first dedicated butter factory in Boonah was built by Samuel Dover in 1900 on property he owned in Church Street neighbouring the Roman Catholic Church. Known as the Fassifern Butter Factory and Ice Works, it was owned by Howes Bros. and employed seven men and collected milk from the various creameries in the area. The local farmers were dissatisfied with Howes Bros. and, after a series of meetings, decided to form a joint venture between the Boonah Farmers Co-Operative Dairy Co., which had been established in 1899, and the Queensland Farmers Co-Operative Association which had been founded in 1899 and was based at the Booval Butter Factory, also known as the Jacaranda Butter Factory. The Queensland Farmers Co- Operative put a proposal to the Boonah Farmers Co-Operative in June 1905 to guarantee to establish a cooperative butter factory in Boonah and, in November 1905, the Boonah Co-Operative opened a dedicated bank account to build the necessary funds to buy a site. In 1907 the two cooperatives merged and purchased the Fassifern Butter Factory and Ice Works from Howes Brothers. Samuel Dover remained in place as manager and, by 1909, the factory output was larger than any of the other factories controlled by the Queensland Farmers Co-Operative Association. Construction Within ten years the site on Church Street was considered too small and poorly positioned. The present site was selected and acquired for ¬£10, 603 on the northern entry to the township adjacent to the railway station and, in both June 1914 and March 1915, tenders were called for the new factory to be constructed. Plans and specifications were available for view at Harding Frew in Brisbane, the offices of John Kerr in Melbourne and, in 1915, the Booval Butter Factory in Ipswich. The factory was a modern brick building with concrete floors, a roof of Marseilles tiles and a railway siding and platform. The engineering drawings were prepared by the architect Robert Kerr of Melbourne, who was referred to as the 'father' of Victorian dairy industry and had been involved in the erection of approximately 400 butter factories in Australia including the first one in Victoria, from engineering drawings and designs created by Duncan Saxelby, the manager of the Queensland Farmers Cooperative Association. The supervising architect was George Thornhill Campbell-Wilson of Brisbane who was responsible for Hughesville, Eight Mile Plains. The building contractor was Mr. A. S. Jevnes. Samuel Dover continued in the role of manager. The new butter factory was fitted with state of the art equipment and was officially opened in July 1916 by the Queensland Governor, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams. During his visit to Boonah, the Governor also unveiled an Honour Board for local men who were serving overseas in World War One. In 1928 additions to the factory were made. During the early twentieth century the quality of dairy products from the region was well established. In 1931 salted butter from the Boonah Butter Factory was awarded the first prize at the London Dairy Show. By the 1930s, the factory had 900 suppliers and during a visit to Boonah in 1938 by the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Joseph Lyons, the prominence and quality of butter from the region was mentioned in speeches. Redesign Opening of the addition to the Boonah Butter Factory, 1933 In 1932 tenders were considered for extensive additions to the butter factory. Construction was to take place during the quieter winter months and the new buildings were designed to complement the existing structure. The only improvements made to the building already on the site were to relay the floors with tile and remove the pillars supporting the top floor so that the top floor could be supported with new steel joists. The Boonah Butter Factory was extended by Messers Stuart Bros. Ltd. of Brisbane following plans created by Thomas Ramsay Hall of the architectural firm of T. R. Hall and Phillips who were also responsible for the Brisbane City Hall, Southport Town Hall and the Boonah Shire Chambers (later demolished). In January 1933 the additions were officially opened by Mr. P. Pease, Minister of Lands. In 1947, plans for four self-contained two storey shops associated with the factory were approved. In April 1954, manufacture commenced on a new line of products at the butter factory with the introduction of butter milk powder. Closure The Boonah Butter Factory closed on 1 March 1974 due to declining production as a result of low prices for milk and shifting agricultural practices in the region. The last batch of butter came off the production line at Boonah at 10:45am. It was packed by Hartley Schumacher with George Kubler, Stan Schlieff, Roydon Kubler and Sel Schneider watching. Milk products from Boonah were subsequently transported to Booval for processing with the majority of employees also transferring to Booval. Booval had ceased operation by 2011 and was demolished by 2016. The Boonah Butter Factory is the only surviving major industrial site related to the dairy, timber and railway industries of Boonah from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The nearby Cossart's Mill at Dugandan was the largest supplier of butter boxes in Australia. Like the butter factory, the sawmill had been a dominant industry and employer in the area. The sawmill was recommended for heritage protection in 1998 as a rare surviving example of a major Queensland sawmill from the mid twentieth century. It was demolished around 2006. The greatest percentage of freight on the railway line were products from the combined output of the butter factory and sawmill. The Dugandan railway line was closed in 1964 and the tracks and associated infrastructure removed. The original location of the Boonah railway station is marked by a memorial adjacent to the Boonah Butter Factory site. The Boonah Butter Factory is now part of a network of extant historic or heritage listed butter factories in South East Queensland that have been re-purposed for cultural or community use including the Kingaroy Butter Factory, Nanango Butter Factory, The Downs Co-operative Dairy Association Limited Factory, Kingston Butter Factory and Grantham Butter Factory.

History  The church was founded in 1552 by Angelo di Poto, a clergyman, on a piece of land given by the municipality, and it was a Parish from 1615 to 1639. The present one was built between 1746 and 1757, in substitution of another Church which stood at the north-eastern corner of the crossing between via Santissimo Salvatore and via Trinit√†.Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare del Golfo, p. 33, Sarograf, Alcamo, 1982. In 1571 they founded the homonymous Confraternity, which was assigned the Church by the General Vicar; its brethren had to say the Liturgy of the Hours, three times a year, on Christmas, on Easter and Pentecost. It was existing until 1615, when the Church was elected a Parish and its brethren left it. They associated some benefits and revenues (such as the Church of Saint Michael the Archangel, the Church of Saint Catherine and the Church of Our Lady of the Chain) to this Church in order to have a certain financial autonomy.http://www.parrocchie.it/alcamo/sanpaolo/storia.htm On October 13, 1639, when there was the pastoral Visit of the new bishop of Mazara del Vallo (Don Giovanni Domenico Spinola), and he noticed that the new two parishes of Santissima Trinit√† and Saint Paul had financial difficulties, suppressed the parish of Santissima Trinit√†. This choice was due to the fact that the town was expanding along Corso 6 Aprile, towards the Saints Paul and Bartholomew's Church. In the Church only the night Congregation remained, but its members, noticing that their Church was going to ruin as time was passing by, decided to leave it and build a new one on the plain in front of it in 1746. The new Church was consecrated in 1757 and in 1771 it was embellished with stuccoes.  Description and works  The Church is with a nave, three altars and a small chapel. Inside it there are the following works: * The Most Holy Trinity: a painting, probable work of the 17th century, representing the Holy Trinity, on the high altar * Mary Help of Christians (Maria Santissima Ausiliatrice) with Saint Giovanni Bosco, a painting made in 1943 by the Franciscan Sisters of Mary in Rome *The Holy Heart of Jesus (Sacro Cuore di Ges√π), a painting made in 1943 by the Franciscan Sisters of Mary in Rome *Our Lady of Sorrows, a statue placed in a small chapel on the left.

They developed between the wars as a recreation and status symbol for rich businessmen. The first aviation of this form developed immediately before World War I, when 'sporting' gentlemen, i.e. those both rich and with ample leisure time, could indulge in private flying. For the first time this regarded flight as a means of safe and reliable transport, not merely an achievement in itself. Right from the outset, the speed of flight and its ability to make long distances manageable was recognised as an advantage. The idea of seasonal commuting between New York and Florida, previously done by train, was one goal. All aspects of aviation were spurred by World War I and there were many technical developments, particularly for engine reliability and the construction of larger, more robust aircraft, including seaplanes. Despite this, the time immediately after World War I was a recession in the aircraft industry, as the surplus market was flooded by ex-military machines and engines. Manufacturers sought any available market they could, including building a handful of specialised aircraft for the very rich. In a more buoyant climate, this minority market might have been less attractive. A typical air yacht of the early 1920s was the Kirkham Air Yacht, built to the order of Harold Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt intended it for transport between his business offices in New York and the family estate at Newport, Rhode Island. Like the contemporary Loening Flying Yacht, it included an enclosed passenger cabin for four with an open pilot's cockpit ahead. Both were of the most modern construction, as monoplanes with duralumin stressed-skin construction. A difference was that the Loening used a war-surplus Liberty engine whilst the Kirkham had the latest, and more powerful, British Napier Lion. Both were flying boats, able to land on any expanse of open water, which was available to the rich at both New York and their seaside country homes. The journey to Newport could be made in around two hours, three times faster than by train and still twice as fast as the journey by car today. As public airfields developed in this decade, later aircraft became amphibians, making them more flexible about their destinations. In 1927, Vanderbilt's Kirkham was destroyed in a hangar fire and he replaced it with a larger, six-seater Fokker. First the Fokker B.IIIC registered as NC149,. This design had been developed by Fokker as the B.3 military patrol aircraft, but failed to sell to the Dutch Navy and so had been converted with a passenger cabin and shipped to the US, meaning it was available to Vanderbilt at short notice. A crash in March 1928, or possibly a further hangar fire, destroyed Vanderbilt's Fokker and this was replaced by NC7887, an example of Fokker's new F.11 design. This was an amphibian design, making it much more flexible for travel inland. Flight in this 'Golden Age' period of aviation was developing rapidly in the US, and better airfield facilities were becoming available throughout the country. Even after the start of the Great Depression, these very-rich pilots were little affected and continued to order larger and larger custom-designed aircraft. Commercial land-based aircraft were also developing and many new owners, affluent but not super-rich, could afford a production-line aircraft when they could not afford a custom design. 'Production' in this pre-war era often meant only a handful of aircraft. Air yachts were owned by rich businessmen and were also found to be useful for purely business travel. These were mostly landplanes by now, rather than seaplanes. Belgian financier Alfred Loewenstein used a Fokker F.VII Trimotor for this purpose, but fell to his death from it in 1928. In time they gave rise to the wider use of executive aircraft.

Saunders, a militia captain. What little was left of Clinton disappeared during construction of the Clinton Lake in the 1960s; only an outbuilding that was converted into a museum remains. Fort Saunders, a solid log house of two stories, was probably constructed in or before May 1856, becoming a stronghold for southerners who settled the area. It contained port holes to allow its occupants to shoot at anyone attacking it. The house had considerable breastworks surrounding it. Situated along Washington Creek, this partisan fort was in a very hilly area. It was probably on top of a high ridge. James Saunders, according to Acting Gov. Daniel Woodson, kept a number of U.S. muskets for the defense of Douglas County inside his fortress home.Kenneth S. Davis, Kansas: A Bicentennial History (New York: W. W. Norton, Inc., 1976), p. 59.Edgar M. Ledyard, ‚ÄúAmerican Posts (Continued),‚Äù The Utah Historical Quarterly (January 1933), Vol. 6, No. 1, p. 33.O. P.

Y. Morgan, State Printer, 1902), Vol. VII, pp. 530, 532. In August 1856 the northern partisans began to move against the southern forts in the area. On August 5 free-state partisans took another southern stronghold at New Georgia. Many of the southern defenders who fled New Georgia's fort made their way to Fort Saunders. On August 12 Franklin's Fort, another area southern fort was taken in a pitched battle. On this same day Maj. David S. Hoyt, a partisan of the northern cause, made his way to the fort to learn all he could about the conditions there.Debra Goodrich Bisel and Michelle M. Martin, Kansas Forts and Bases: Sentinels on the Prairie (Charleston, S. C.: The History Press, 2013), p. 53. Hoyt had a discussion with Col. B. F. Treadwell, the fort's commander. It seems that men from the fort were committing depredations against the free- state settlers and some settlers were harassed. One source said appeals had been made to the U.S. Army to intervene to put an end to the depredations. Army leaders would not act unless requested by the territorial government, which refused to make such a request. Hoyt tried, but failed, to make an arrangement with Treadwell to have these problems ended. Hoyt and Treadwell were both Freemasons. Hoyt trusted Treadwell to ensure the safety of a fellow Mason. Hoyt was not harmed while at the fort, but on his return trip he was brutally murdered and his body was mutilated before it was buried in a shallow grave.Frank W. Blackmar, ed., Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc. (Chicago: Standard Pub. Co., 1912), Vol. I, p. 671. When Hoyt failed to return home and his body was found near Fort Saunders, his free-state comrades wanted revenge for Hoyt‚Äôs murder. On August 15 a group of possibly 400 to 500 men, led by James H. Lane, moved toward Fort Saunders. Pickets from Fort Saunders saw the approaching men and the entire command under Treadwell fled without firing a shot. Possibly a one man remained in the fort and, if so, he offered no resistance. Woodson claimed the muskets allotted for the defense of Douglas County at the fort were stolen by the northerners. The southerners left provisions, arms and ammunition. They even left a hot meal on the table. The free-state forcey took the supplies. It was said a number of items were found that had been stolen from various locations in the county. Before the northerners left they burned the building, which was never rebuilt.William E.

The firm was founded by Prussian immigrant Frederick Bromberg in Mobile in 1836, the oldest family owned and operated retail business in the United States url=http://jacksonville.com/tu- online/stories/070699/bus_bizAlaba.html title=Alabama jewelers just keep ticking work=Associated Press in Florida Times-Union date=July 6, 1999 accessdate=2016-11-03 }} and the oldest business firm operating in the state.  Mobile  Bromberg traveled to New York in 1832 after Napoleon's invasion made his village (Bromberg) a part of Poland. He worked as a silversmith and married Lisette Cunigarde Dorothea Beetz, a native of Hamburg. On the recommendation of acquaintances, the couple set off for the port of Mobile to start a new life together. They arrived on the packet boat Lewis Cass, he wasted no time setting up shop at the corner of Walter & St Michael streets. He started by stocking musical instruments, pianos and sheet music, gradually adding jewelry and gifts. He did well at first, but the panic of 1837, accompanied by a fire that destroyed his store two years later, forced Bromberg to start from scratch. At his second store, at 22 Dauphin Street, Bromberg added furniture, toys and antiques to his inventory. A yellow fever epidemic threatened the business again as most of the city was affected. Mrs Bromberg, weakened by the disease, was sent to Cambridge, Massachusetts for its more healthful climate while Frederick labored alone. She returned in 1840, and the business finally started to grow and prosper. Bromberg's sons, Frederick G. Bromberg and Charles, and his son-in-law Emil O. Zadek all joined the business, which was interrupted by the Civil War. When the elder Bromberg died in 1884, Charles and Zadek took over the business as partners. Over time, Charles became enamored of living in Bayou la Batre, where he had begun operating a resort, and Zadek took over daily operations of the Bromberg store.  Birmingham  Charles' son, Frederick W. Bromberg, grew up in the family business and in 1900 made the decision, with his wife, Virginia, to open a store in the rapidly growing city of Birmingham. He bought out an existing jeweler, Gluck and Black, and took over their space in Linn's Folly, the first home of the First National Bank of Birmingham. His sign read F. W. Bromberg, Jeweler. He relocated to the new Farley Building two blocks north when it was completed in 1902. In the next years his four children, William, Robert, Charles and Frank, all began working in the store. At their father's direction, they each served apprenticeships outside the company to gain expertise in different areas of the business. William spent time with the Whitehouse Brothers, a Cincinnati diamond manufacturer, and became a registered jeweler through the American Gem Society. Robert studied business at Harvard. Charles apprenticed in the New England silver industry, and Frank learned the furniture and accessory business in Chicago. Following World War I, F. W. Bromberg travelled to Germany and bought up significant inventories of precious objects from museums. The expanding business moved into a larger space at 218 20th Street North in 1920. The four young men formed a partnership with their father in 1926. Cemented in its position as Birmingham's premiere jewelry and gift shop, the business was able to survive the Depression. The store branched out into optical and hearing aids and home air conditioning. The Brombergs also opened the first authorized Eastman Kodak dealer in the South. F. W. Bromberg died unexpectedly at his summer residence in Cape Cod in 1939. Charles left to pursue other interests, but the other three brothers stayed with the firm, which prospered during World War II. After WWII ended construction began on a new retail location at 123 North 20th Street in Downtown Birmingham. This location is currently the corporate office for the company. The company is currently under the leadership of Frederick W. \\"Ricky\\" Bromberg. He is a part of the sixth generation of Brombergs to run the business.  New building  After the Drennon Department Store building at 123 20th Street North, at the intersection of 2nd Avenue burned in 1943, the Bromberg's negotiated to obtain the property for a grand new store. They hired J. Gordon Carr, the architect of Tiffany's 5th Avenue flagship store, to design the modern showcase. As soon as building materials were available following the war, Brice Building Company began work. The grand re-opening was held on July 22, 1946. Along with the new store, the brothers created a corporation, with Robert as president, William as vice-president, and Frank as secretary-treasurer.  Expansion  Robert and William both died in the 1950s, leaving Frank to head the company along with his son, Frank Jr., William's son Gene, and Robert's son-in-law, Paul M. Byrne. In 1959 the company opened a second location in Mountain Brook Village. In 1974, Bromberg's acquired the Underwood Jewelers Corporation of Jacksonville, Florida, creating a separate retail division for the company. In the decades to come the company opened stores in Montgomery, Huntsville, Tuscaloosa and Hoover which they eventually closed at varying times to concentrate on the Birmingham market. In 2002 the company opened another location at The Summit. On March 6, 2009 the company closed its downtown store, but renovated the building to keep it in use as the company's main office with active displays in the windows.

App. 3d 196, 238 Cal. Rptr. 82 (1987), is a legal case illustrative of when a defendant forfeits his right to self-defense, because his own uncharged culpable acts set in motion the conditions in which self-defense would be needed; he caused the condition of his own defense.Criminal Law - Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , Killing in Self-Defence, F Leverick, p123 This principle put forth by the court as to the underlying murder case was generalized to other kinds of cases.Robinson, Paul H., Causing the Conditions of One's Own Defense: A Study in the Limits of Theory in Criminal Law Doctrine (1985).

Generally, if one makes a felonious assault upon another... the original assailant cannot slay his adversary in self-defense unless he has first, in good faith, declined further combat, and has fairly notified him that he has abandoned the affray.

She writes under the pseudonym J. Goldenlane. Goldenlane is a popular fantasy author in Hungary. She had a strong influence on the Hungarian sci-fi and fantasy generation that started in the 2010s. Her writings have been published by Delta Vision since 2015. It has also published revised editions of six of her earlier novels. Her novels were formerly published by Beholder. Early life and education J√∫lia Goldman was born in Orosh√°za, Hungary. Her parents are archaeologists, and she was taught by them at the age of eight how to excavate a neolithic tomb. She attended local schools and graduated at J√≥zsef Attila Tudom√°nyegyetem (now called University of Szeged). She studied programming, but never held a job in this field. She also studied violin and martial arts. Personal life Goldman has worked as a mathematician and resides in Szeged. There she married and had three children with her husband before his death. Career After the fall of the Soviet Union, the field of fantasy and science fiction publishing in Hungary was stimulated by social and political changes. Capitalism stimulated experimentation and many new journals and, finally, online publishing ventures flourished. Goldman started writing short stories and novels, largely of the fantasy and science fiction genres. Writing under the pen name of J. Goldenlane, she sought out many publishing houses before Beholder finally published Isteni balh√© (2001). Because of being isolated by language, Hungarian authors had a tradition of publishing under anglicized names to appeal to English-speaking markets. In addition, Goldman chose to use an initial rather than her given name to gain sales in the male-dominated fantasy/adventure world, as has English writer J.K. Rowling of the Harry Potter series. In the following years Goldman published a series of novels with Beholder and short stories in a variety of journals. She has said that her style was influenced by Jen≈ë Rejt≈ë and Antal Szerb. In 2006 Goldman was described as \\"an outstanding new writer\\" by Hungarian editor P√©ter Tick.P√©ter Tick, \\"A Brief History of Hungarian Fantasy\\", trans. by Csilla Kleinheincz, Roham Magazine #3, 2006; posted at The World SF Blog, 23 March 2011 After 2005, Goldman withdrew for a period from writing and publishing to devote more time to her family. But she co-authored a cookbook with Di√°na Balogh. Goldenlane published again in 2015 with her post-apocalyptic novel Napnak f√©nye, released by Delta Vision. This house has also begun to publish revised editions of her older works, releasing six novels by 2016. It will continue to publish her future works. =Trivia= * Her first novel, Isteni balh√© was published thanks to a power shortage. The editor of the publisher was waiting for his computer to restart and happened to start reading her manuscript. He said that he could not stop reading it, he enjoyed it so much, and supported its being published. * After her husband's death, she started a Patreon page to finance her writing career, in addition to supporting her three children.

To get ahead, the friends must compete alongside their enemies and tackle challenges in the name of friendship. Format =Starting game= The show begins with an introduction from Defries, who then lets four contestant teams of two best friends (dressed in blue, pink, purple, and silver shirts) out of \\"The Mixer\\" (a large carousel- like contraption at the center of the platform on the set). Each pair of contestants explains why they are best friends before playing the first game of the show, Tube Strike. The conceit of Tube Strike is for the two best friends to navigate a large clear balloon to the opposite end of the playing area, use the balloon to knock down a target illuminated in the team's color, before returning to the center of the playing area to hit a red balloon (causing it to burst). The team who succeeds earns the \\"Hand of Friendship\\", an item that allows the team an advantage in the final round if they make it there. =Main games= Before the next challenge, Defries explains how the main game works: the eight contestants are randomly split into four groups of \\"frenemies\\" - pairs of contestants from different teams - by The Mixer, and then compete with one another in a challenge, typically a race to complete an objective. The group who performs the worst in the challenge or does not finish before the other groups will be put under \\"Lockdown\\", and prohibited from participating further. This continues for two more rounds, one with three pairs of frenemies, and one with two pairs. The last remaining pair is allowed to remove their teammates from Lockdown and will move on to the final round. The games played in these rounds are different from episode to episode. Before each game, Defries will comment on the pairs of frenemies generated by The Mixer and give his opinions on how each group might fare, and he gives a running commentary throughout the games. Main round games * Rip Off: The groups of frenemies must put on triangular costumes covered in smaller triangles, and work together to remove the smaller triangles from the suit. When they believe they are done, they must shout \\"Rip off!\\", where Defries will tell them if they have removed all the triangles or not. * You Cube: The groups of frenemies will work to complete a six-piece cubical puzzle, of which three pieces have already been given. The pieces are fairly unwieldy and prone to jamming, requiring the frenemies to work together to secure them. * In the Pipeline: Frenemies will work together to get a ball bearing through a clear pipe maze using a single magnet. Each group of frenemies is separated by a barrier, requiring them to pass the magnet to their partner to continue progress. * Pump Action: Frenemies use a bike pump to inflate hand-shaped balloons until they burst open, and then attach the air hose from their pump to the next balloon in their set. After four balloons (the last of which is more durable than the rest), the team is finished. * Gutted: Teams of frenemies will need to move a large gutter filled with large green and small orange balls in order to get the orange balls to a hole at the other end of the gutter. Four orange balls in the pocket of the gutter is the victory condition. * Push On Through: Teams of frenemies will attempt to push large multicolored pool noodles through a wall, one color of noodles corresponding to their pair, while attempting to put noodles from opposing pairs of frenemies back in the wall. The team with the fewest noodles pushed through the wall at the end of 60 seconds is the losing team. =Final round= The final round is a best-of-11 quiz comparable to the final from Get Your Own Back, featuring both teams represented by the final pair of frenemies reunited and competing with each other. The two teams are situated in mine carts with six hands of varying colors placed in the tracks their carts are on, with a 5x5 grid of the letters \\"KEEPYOURENEMIESCLOSEFINAL\\" separate from this railway. On each team's turn, one letter on the grid will be illuminated and Defries will read out a category. The team who is playing will have five seconds to come up and say two correct answers - items within that category that start with the illuminated letter. If the team succeeds, their opponent will move one space down the track (knocking down a hand on their track in the process), and the team themselves will move down one space if they fail to come up with the requisite answers in time. If the team who won Tube Strike is present in the final, they may use the Hand of Friendship as an automatic correct answer by calling out \\"Hand of Friendship\\". Whoever moves down six spaces and knocks over the final hand, the \\"clag barrier\\", is the loser, and the winning team gets to pull a lever that sends the losing team down the track. At the end of the track are chutes filled with \\"clag\\" (yellow/green gunge), which will be poured on the losing team as they pass under the chutes. The winning team receives silver hand-shaped medallions - one right, one left. Episodes There are 26 episodes & 2 series altogether.

She made numerous voyages between West Africa and the Caribbean carrying slaves, during which she several times successfully repelled attacks by French privateers. Will apparently foundered in a squall in July 1806, shortly before the passage of the Slave Trade Act 1807 abolished the slave trade for British subjects. Slave trading Captain James Locke received a letter of marque for Will on 4 July 1797. A database of slave voyages by Liverpool-based vessels shows Will, James Lake, master, sailing to the Bight of Biafra and the Gulf of Guinea islands.

In Jamaica, Crow lost 31 crew members‚Äî10 died, the Royal Navy pressed 15, and six deserted‚Äîforcing him to bring on 13 new crew members. Will left Jamaica on 14 February 1799 and arrived in Liverpool on 9 April, with a crew of 23, apparently having lost two more crew members en route.Blog Cannundrums: \\"George Cannon compared to Hugh Crow\\" (31 July 2009). Accessed 4 October 2016. For her second slaving voyage, Will left Liverpool on 25 July 1799, with a crew of 42. She again sailed to Bonny. Near Cape Palmas a French privateer schooner fired on Will, but sheered off on meeting resistance. Then after Will had been at Bonny for some three months gathering slaves, Hugh Crow's brother Will, captain of Charlotte, brought the intelligence that there were three French frigates in the area. Next day, three frigates and a schooner came up and anchored some four miles away. They then sent their boats to attack Will. However, the tide was at half-ebb and the boats did not push over the Barleur bank, which stood between them and their target. After a two-hour long-range exchange of fire, Will cut her cables and returned to Bonny. There the nine ships in the harbour organized themselves under the command of Captain Latham of Lottery and sallied forth, anchoring in a line about four miles from the French vessels, which after a week gave up and sailed away. On 2 February 1800, a French privateer attacked Will. Crow fought back, driving the privateer off, though not without suffering casualties and a great deal of damage. In the engagement, Will had three crewmen wounded, two slaves killed, and ten slaves wounded. Crow estimated that had the French vessel attacked once more he would have been forced to strike. Will arrived at Kingston on 7 March, with 405 slaves on board; he had embarked 442, for a loss rate of 8.4%. Crow had six crew members die and four desert. When she arrived, boats from eight warships arrived and pressed many of Wills crew. Then on 12 April, during a celebration in honour of Rodney's victory, the crew on board a nearby sloop fired a gun that was still loaded with a double-headed shot. The projectile hit Wills doctor, had been drinking coffee on the quarterdeck, killing him. Will left for Britain on 19 May. He arrived back at Liverpool on 15 July. Prior to leaving on his third slaving voyage, \\"Crowe\\" received a letter of marque on 28 August. Will sailed again on 6 November, but did not reach Bonny for almost 10 weeks. There she took on the captain and crew of Diana, which had wrecked.

Captain John Ferrier, of York, appointed Crow a senior captain of the convoy, and placed Will at the rear of the convoy as \\"whipper-in\\". Will encountered Hector, Blackie, master, of Liverpool, which was not part of the convoy but was in a sinking state. Hector capsized before Crow could get her crew off, but he was still able to save all but one man on her, a passenger who drowned as she capsized and went under. Will arrived back at Liverpool on 19 July, lost only two of her 42 crew members in the overall voyage. After his return to Liverpool, Crow received two pieces of silver. The merchants and underwriters of Liverpool gave him an engraved silver plate worth ¬£200 commemorating him on his feat of driving off three French frigates on 16 December 1799. Also, the Lloyd's underwriters gave him an engraved silver cup commemorating Crow's defeat of the French privater brig on 21 February 1800. Crow left on his fourth slaving voyage on Will on 11 November 1801. She was delayed for some time at Cape Palmas due to an absence of wind. After collecting a cargo of slaves at Bonny, Crow sailed for the Portuguese island of S√£o Tom√©) to resupply. There one of Wills officers fell overboard and was eaten by sharks before the crew could rescue him. Also, there Crow found the master (Wright), crew, and some slaves from the brig , which had wrecked on the coast of Africa. Crow took them aboard, including some 60 slaves. Disease broke out among the rescued men and after Crow landed them some time later at Barbados, most died. Crow then sailed on to Kingston. Crow and Will arrived at Kingston on 30 June 1802. He had embarked 327 slaves and landed 294, for a loss rate of 10.1%. Will and Crow arrived back at Liverpool on 23 October 1802, narrowly missing being shipwrecked on the coast of Wales. He had lost seven of his 35-man crew. Aspinal & Co. had Will repaired and laid up, and Crow moved to a new ship, Ceres. Captain John Brelsford received a letter of marque on 21 June 1804. That year he sailed to the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands, and then to Jamaica.Trans-Atlantic Salve Voyages Database: Will, Brelsford.

History Mercuryville was founded in 1874, after cinnabar, a mercury bearing ore, was discovered in eastern Sonoma County around 1870. Mercury is a dense liquid metal that can be used to separate gold from other less dense materials. The California Gold Rush, which had begun only 20 years earlier, increased the demand and price of mercury to $1 a pound‚Äîapproximately $20 in 2018 dollars‚Äîmaking extracting the ore profitable, and prompting a short-lived mercury rush in the 1870s. When the price of ore dropped within a few years, most mines were quickly abandoned. In its heyday, the town had eight bars that were notorious for fights, and a single church. Mercury was also mined in other areas of Sonoma County at the time, including mines near Guerneville. As per the name of the town, mercury was its primary economic engine and there were several mines in the area. The nearby Socrates Mine, about 5 miles west of Mercuryville, produced mercury bearing ores including: cinnabar, montroydite, edgarbaileyite, magnesite, and tiemannite. The mine also bore other minerals including chalcedony, opal, and pyrite. The area has considerable geothermal resources, with active fumaroles and hot springs. Located nearby is the Geysers, the world's largest geothermal energy generation facility that provides 725 megawatts of energy; it produces enough electricity to power the city of San Francisco. By 1963 the settlement of Mercuryville had diminished in population to a population of two, and the town then consisted of a gas station/store that doubled as a home for an elderly couple. By this time the nearby Geysers resort was rundown with a main pool and a few smaller gender segregated pools. By the mid-1960s the gas station had closed and Mercuryville had become a ghost town. One of the last remaining large mine buildings was burned in wildfires in the mid-1970s, although some concrete structures and metalwork from the mines remain.

The group was formed by Anna Murphy (vocals, hurdy-gurdy, flute), Merlin Sutter (drums) and Ivo Henzi (guitars and bass). Cellar Darling incorporates heavy metal, folk, classical, and progressive influences. Notably, the band uses a hurdy-gurdy, an old folk instrument and a traverse flute. The trio were previously part of the Swiss metal band Eluveitie. History =Formation= In May 2016 three longtime members of Eluveitie announced their departure from the band. Anna Murphy - female singer & hurdy-gurdy player, Ivo Henzi - guitarist, and Merlin Sutter - drummer parted ways with Eluveitie in a highly publicised split. The exact details of the split were not cited in the press, but wide speculation ensued among fans. In June 2016 the trio announced the creation of Cellar Darling. The band quickly began working on new music for their debut release. On 23 September 2016 Cellar Darling launched a single called \\"Challenge\\" along with the b-side track \\"Fire, Wind & Earth\\". The single was self released and the video was created and directed by the band themselves. The musical style of the initial release was a concrete departure from the folk metal genre of their previous band. Cellar Darling quickly gained recognition and played their first ever shows in December 2016 supporting Amorphis in Zurich, Switzerland and The Gentle Storm in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. =\\"This Is The Sound\\" and signing to Nuclear Blast= In January 2017 the trio announced their signing to a German independent metal label Nuclear Blast Records, and that their debut album would be released through the label the following summer. In May, it was announced that Cellar Darling's first album would be entitledThis Is the Sound and was to be released on 30 June 2017. A tracklist of the album was introduced. Cellar Darling released their second ever single called \\"Black Moon\\" on 19 May 2017, along with a music video. This was followed on 17 June 2017 with a third single, \\"Avalanche\\". Both videos were shot in Tenerife. The debut album was released on 30 June 2017 to widespread critical acclaim. The musical style of the debut release was a definite departure from folk metal, despite the use of the hurdy-gurdy. Cellar Darling remained true to their metal and rock roots and introduced elements of progressive metal into some of the songs on \\"This Is The Sound\\". Lyrically, the album focused on apocalyptic stories connecting around the motif of the end of the world. A perfect balance of darkness and light shines through the entire record, both lyrically and musically. Cellar Darling toured extensively all over the world in support of the album utilising services of a session bass player as well as some guest musicians (who appear on the album)for selected shows. The album charted in Switzerland, Germany and the UK. =\\"The Spell\\"= The second release was announced to be a concept album and was backed up by strong progressive metal rhetoric. On 2 November 2018 the first single was released. \\"Insomnia\\" was a definite step towards progressive metal and it was accompanied by a music video created by Costin Chioreanu. The band announced that the entire album will be accompanied by videos by Costin to better visualise the concept and the story behind \\"The Spell\\". Another single entitled \\"Death\\" followed. Cellar Darling's second album The Spell was released on 22 March 2019 on Nuclear Blast Records.https://www.sonicperspectives.com/album-reviews/cellar-darling- the-spell/ \\"The Spell\\" is a concept album telling a story of a girl who falls in love with Death and aims to join Death in eternal life. Musically the album combines elements of progressive metal, progressive rock and folk rock with audible influences by bands like Black Sabbath or Jethro Tull. The storytelling facet was further represented by an addition to the special edition digibook of an audiobook. A story of \\"The Spell\\" was presented in a form of a tale told by the singer Anna Murphy. The same story was later transcribed and released by the band as an actual limited edition book (print limited to 250 pieces). \\"The Spell\\" entered charts in Switzerland, Germany and the UK.

History The fortress was originally built in the Byzantine era. It was captured by the Knights Hospitaller on 20 September 1306, being their first possession on the island that would become their base. By 1408 it was in ruins, and was repaired under the Grand Masters Giovanni Battista Orsini (1467‚Äì76) and Pierre d'Aubusson (1476‚Äì1503) as a stronghold to protect the area, and particularly watch over the anchorages at the Charaki and Agia Agathi beaches nearby. After 1470, the Hospitallers abandoned all other fortifications on the island except for Feraklos, nearby Lindos, and the city of Rhodes, which in turn were further strengthened. A decree of 1474 prescribed that the Feraklos Castle was the place of refuge by the inhabitants of the villages of Malona, Salia, Katagros, Zinodotou, and Kaminari when there was danger. The fort was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1523 after a long siege, a few months after the capture of Rhodes. The Ottomans did not use the castle and it has since been abandoned. Layout The fortress has an irregular polygonal layout, with a wall perimeter of 680 m encompassing an area of 1,700 square meters. The northern and western portions date to Byzantine times, but the rest are additions or modifications by the Hospitallers. A single gate and two cylindrical towers survive in the southern portion of the walls, along with a cistern in the interior.

She was the first woman in Uganda to obtain a doctorate degree in architecture, and as of February 2019, the only one. Background and education She was born to Mrs Grace Nnaggenda, a fashion designer and Professor Francis Nnaggenda, the well-known sculptor and painter. Both parents resided at Mengo, in Kampala, Uganda's capital city. She attended Nakasero Primary School for her elementary schooling. For her O-Level studies, she went to Trinity College Nabbingo, in Wakiso District. She completed her A-Level education at Makerere High School, where she obtained her High School Diploma, in 1988. She credits her parents, especially her father, with encouraging her to channel her artistic talents into architecture. In the 1980s there were no architecture courses at Ugandan universities. Her father suggested that she applied for a scholarship. In 1989, she secured a scholarship to study in the former Soviet Union, and was admitted to the Kharkov State University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, in present-day Ukraine. In 1994, she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Architecture. The following year, the same university awarded her a Master of Science degree in the same subject. Later, she was admitted to the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, in Stockholm, Sweden, on scholarship from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. There she graduated with a Licentiate Degree in Urban Planning, in 2004. Four years later, she was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Urban Planning and the Environment, the first Ugandan woman to attain that academic achievement. Her studies at the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, involved periods of research in the \\"informal settlements\\" of Uganda and Kenya. She specializes in sustainable urban settlements and low-income housing schemes in developing countries. Career In 1995, following her master's degree, she returned to Uganda and was hired by Land Plan Group, an architectural firm, as an architectural intern. She also worked as a part-time lecturer in the Department of Architecture at Makerere University. In 2002, the university hired her on a full-time basis as an assistant lecturer. Upon graduation with her doctorate degree, she was promoted to full lecturer, in 2008. She has spoken out on the subject of affordable housing for the poor and urged the Ugandan government and Kampala City Council (the predecessor to Kampala Capital City Authority), which she accused of corruption and incompetence, to do better in order to avoid sprawling slums. Her research suggests that low-rise housing would be a better solution than single-storey detached dwellings for the very poor. It makes better use of land, is more likely to allow people to live within reach of jobs, and ultimately requires less expenditure on infrastructure. Her proposals could be part of an \\"enabling strategy\\" for low-cost housing using local people's ideas and craft skills, according to Professor Emeritus Dick Urban Vestbro of KTH.

Its mission statement said that it was \\"possible and desirable to preserve the Irish Language in those parts of the Country where it is spoken, with a view to its further extension and cultivation.\\" Hyde wrote that the formation of the society could truly be said to be the first attempt made to recruit the common people to the cause of the Irish language..

Initial Assault  When the Roman consuls Manius Manilius and Lucius Marcius Censorinus made their beachhead at Carthage, they deployed separately in two different locations; Manilius set up his camp on the isthmus leading up to the city, directly facing the citadel of Byrsa, while Censorinus made his encampment on the shore of Lake Tunis, opposite the western wall of Carthage. Manilius planned to fill the ditch facing the southern wall and from there scale it, while Censorinus intended to raise ladders to the western wall from the ground and the decks of the ships. Two initial assaults were enacted, with the consuls thinking the Carthaginians were without arms, but they were surprised to find the citizens re-armed and were subsequently repelled on both attempts. Fearing the approach of Hasdrubal the Boetharch, who was encamped on the other side of Lake Tunis, both consuls fortified their camps.Appian, Punica 97  Surprise Attack on Censorinus' Camp  After fortifying his camp, Censorinus dispatched his men to gather timber from the far side of Lake Tunis, intending to build new siege engines. The Carthaginian cavalry commander Himilco Phameas, seizing on this opportunity, raided the workers as they gathered timber, resulting in a loss of 500 men and a great deal of tools for constructing siege works. Nevertheless, Censorinus acquired sufficient timber to create siege engines and ladders, and he and Manilius launched another attack on the city in concert, which was again repulsed.Appian, Punica 97 Manilius decided against launching another assault on the walls from the isthmus, but Censorinus, having filled up parts of the lake to provide room, constructed two battering rams, one for his fleet and another supported by 6000 infantry. In the subsequent assault on the walls from Lake Tunis, Censorinus' troops managed to breach Carthage's wall before being driven off by the defenders, who hastily began repairing the breach. Fearing a second assault, the Carthaginians sallied from the unrepaired wall that evening and assaulted the camp on Lake Tunis, torching a great deal of the Roman siege engines.Appian, Punica 98 The next day, the Roman troops attempted to break through the gap in the wall, though Scipio Aemilianus, then serving as military tribune under Censorinus refused to enter and held his troops in reserve, instead spacing them at regular intervals along the wall. While Aemilianus' troops avoided the battle, the other troops were met by staunch resistance from the Carthaginians fighting back in the gap, and the Roman troops suffered heavy casualties as the defenders attacked from the broken wall.Appian, Punica 98  Roman Withdrawal and Fire Attack  Around 27 July - at the appearance of Sirius on the horizon at sunrise - Censorinus faced an epidemic in his ranks, having kept his troops on stagnant water with poor airflow from the sea over Carthage's walls. Accordingly, Censorinus relocated his camp to a site on the shore of the sea. The Carthaginians, noting the movement of the Roman fleet, constructed fire ships in their harbour and launched them along the coastline when the Roman fleet came into view. The resulting fire attack destroyed most of the Roman fleet, and substantially set back the Roman assault. Shortly afterwards, Censorinus returned to Rome to conduct elections, and the attacks on Manilius increased in intensity.Appian, Punica 99  See also  * Third Punic War * Punic Wars * Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)  References  *Appian of Alexandria, Roman History, \\"Punica\\" Category:149 BC Lake Tunis Lake Tunis Category:140s BC conflicts ","title":"Battle of Lake Tunis"},{"id":"51804413","text":"Fenimorea contracta is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Drilliidae.Bouchet, P.

Following the verdict Newcastle Falcons released the following statement: ‚ÄúNewcastle Falcons have welcomed the not-guilty verdict in the trial of Zach Kibirige. The club have been aware of the allegations hanging over Zach since his initial arrest (he faced charges of sexual assault). This has been an extremely stressful time for Zach, and his hugely promising rugby career has effectively been put on hold during this very difficult period. The club are satisfied that their faith in Zach has been borne out by the verdict in his trial. Zach remains an important member of the club‚Äôs playing staff and is available for all rugby and non-rugby-related duties. Newcastle Falcons will be making no further comment on this matter.‚Äù Playing career Club Career: Zach began his career playing junior rugby with his local club Darlington RFC and at Yarm school. He then joined Newcastle Falcons at age 12, and made his senior debut for the club at the age of 17, where he is recognised for his speed and attacking prowess. In December 2012, Zach signed his first professional contract with Newcastle Falcons, at age 18. International Career: Zach represented his country at Under 17, 18 and 20‚Äôs level. In summer 2015, Kibirige was called up to the England Sevens side for the Rugby European Sevens Grand Prix Series event in Lyon, France.

Perhaps as a result of this, membership in the 19th-century never reached 2,000. In about 1900, it was renamed as the National Society of Brushmakers, and was recognised by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) as the oldest union in the country.

While there were previous Iran or near-Iranian sources of scholarship of the religion in early periods, wide-ranging publications covering mostly western literature include Moojan Momens' 1981 The Babi and Baha'i Religions, 1844‚Äì1944: Some Contemporary Western Accounts, William Collins' 1992 Bibliography of English- language works on the B√°b√≠ and Bah√° º√≠ faiths, 1844‚Äì1985, and MacEoin's annotated bibliography borrowing heavily from Collins' work.

Mostly these works explicitly ignored newspaper accounts. =19th century= A wide variety of accounts, encounters and investigations began to circulate outside of Persia as events began to unfold from the Spring of 1844 with the Declaration of the B√°b. Initially viewed as an Iranian development and often through Christian missionary perspectives, the growth of religion would soon far transcend that limited perspective. * Diplomatic reports on B√°b√≠ activities begins January 8, 1845 concerning the fate of Mull√°  øAli-e BastƒÅmi.

Pakistan rejected that a strike took place, stating that Indian troops had not crossed the Line of Control but had only skirmished with Pakistani troops at the border, resulting in the deaths of two Pakistani soldiers and the wounding of nine. Pakistan rejected India's reports of any other casualties. Pakistani sources reported that at least 8 Indian soldiers were killed in the exchange, and one was captured. India confirmed that one of its soldiers was in Pakistani custody, but denied that it was linked to the incident or that any of its soldiers had been killed. The Indian operation was said to be in retaliation for a militant attack on the Indian army at Uri on 18 September in the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir that left 19 soldiers dead. In the succeeding days and months, India and Pakistan continued to exchange fire along the border in Kashmir, resulting in dozens of military and civilian casualties on both sides. Timeline =2016 ‚Äì initial strikes= On 29 September, eleven days after the Uri attack, the Indian army reported it conducted surgical strikes against suspected militants in Pakistani- administered Kashmir. Lt Gen Ranbir Singh, Indian Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), said that it had received \\"very credible and specific information\\" about \\"terrorist teams\\" who were preparing to \\"carry out infiltration and conduct terrorist strikes inside Jammu and Kashmir and in various metros in other states\\". The Indian action was meant to pre-empt their infiltration. Indian media reported variously that between 35 and 70 terrorists had been killed. Pakistan denied that such surgical strikes occurred. The Inter-Services Public Relations said that there had been only \\"cross border firing\\". But, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the \\"unprovoked and naked aggression of Indian forces\\", which he said resulted in the death of two Pakistani soldiers. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said that the UN Observer Group in Pakistani Kashmir did not directly observe any \\"firing across the Line of Control\\" relating to the incident.UN chief Ban Ki- moon offers to mediate between India, Pakistan , Hindustan Times, 1 October 2016. India snubs UN for saying didn‚Äôt ‚Äòobserve‚Äô LoC firing , The Indian Express, 2 October 2016. The Indian envoy at UN Syed Akbaruddin dismissed this statement, saying \\"facts on the ground do not change whether somebody acknowledges or not.\\" Analyst Sandeep Singh, writing in The Diplomat, said that the operation is better characterised as a cross-border raid because \\"surgical strikes\\" involve striking deep into the enemy territory and typically using air power. =2016 ‚Äì Post-strikes= On 1 October, Pakistan said its soldiers had come under fire in Bhimber and they responded to the attack.

He was educated at the Craigmount School in Edinburgh and at the University of Edinburgh, where he obtained a doctorate. Following graduation in 1876, he spent three years at Chambers's Encyclopaedia. Muirhead thereafter commenced a thirty-five year association (1879-1914) with the Baedeker publishing house, where he was the editor of the English and American editions of Baedeker's Handbook for Travellers, as well as writing separate guides based on Muirhead's own travels. Muirhead's guides based on his personal travels included guides to the United States, England and Canada.Gerald Fitzpatrick, Mostly untamed and only partly civilized. The Globe and Mail, 15 December 2007. Retrieved 2016-10-07. It was emphasized in the guides based on his own travels, such as the guides to the United States and Canada, that Muirhead had \\"personally visited the greater part of the districts described\\". For example, Muirhead spent three years travelling the United States, from 1890 to 1893, to obtain the information for his travel guide of that country. He also used his American travels to write A Land of Contrasts, published in 1898,Ford Madox Ford, The Good Soldier: A Tale of Passion (1915), p. 337. in addition to his work on the related Baedeker guidebook. Muirhead also translated poetry and wrote for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Muirhead's association with Baedeker, a company long established and based in Germany, ended with the outbreak of the First World War. He thereafter assisted his brother Findlay in the development of the Blue Guides. Both brothers had been longtime associates of Baedeker. In 1915, they acquired the rights to Murray's Handbooks for Travellers, which formed the basis for the development of the Blue Guides.

He found the atmosphere lacking and the minor characters distracting from the main plot line. Diane Selkirk for Apollo Movie Guide gave the film a score of 70/100, writing that \\"the movie does flow well and the story comes across clearly, but it just seems weaker than you'd expect.\\" She questioned the decision to not base any of the film's characters on actual people. She echoed The Movie Scene's sentiment that a documentary or theatrical film would be a better format to tell the story of the Port Chicago disaster.

The proscribed act has justification if the act had positive effects that outweigh its negative effects, or is not wrong or blameworthy. The proscribed act is excused if the defendant's violation was not entirely voluntary, such as if they acted under duress or under a false belief. Martin v. Ohio (1986) established that states may make justification an affirmative defense, placing the burden of proof on defendant. Patterson v. New York (1977) established that states may make excuses, such as involving mental state, an affirmative defense, rather than part of the mens rea element the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. \\"Conduct... may be either justified... or excused... A defense of justification is the product of society's determination that the actual existence of certain circumstances will operate to make proper and legal what otherwise would be criminal conduct. A defense of excuse, contrarily, does not make legal and proper conduct which ordinarily would result in criminal liability; instead, it openly recognizes the criminality of the conduct but excuses it because the actor believed that circumstances actually existed which would justify his conduct when in fact they did not. In short, had the facts been as he supposed them to be, the actor's conduct would have been justified rather than excused...\\"State v. Leidholm, Supreme Court of North Dakota, 334 N.W.2d 811 (1983), Justice VandeWalle An example is that breaking into someone's home during a fire in order to rescue a child inside, is justified. If the same act is done in the belief that there was a fire, when in fact there was no fire, then the act is excused if the false belief was reasonable. What is justified under a utilitarian perspective might be excused under a retributivist standpoint, and vice versa. The American Law Institute Model Penal Code expresses \\"skepticism that any fine line can be drawn states a fine line between justification and excuse can sensibly be drawn... To say someone's conduct is 'justified' ordinarily connotes that the conduct is thought to be right, or at least not undesirable; to say that someone's conduct is 'excused' ordinarily connotes that the conduct is thought to be undesirable but for some reason the actor is not to be blamed for it.\\" References Category:Criminal defenses ","title":"Justification and excuse"},{"id":"51804952","text":"Natasha ( / Nata≈°a) is a 2001 Yugoslav drama film directed by Ljubi≈°a Samard≈æiƒá.

Dhani is welcomed by Gandhar at the location, where he takes her around the school and introduces the students. Thoithoi, a student at the school and his Pupu(Grandfather) comes to Dhani to ask her if she can tutor Thoithoi since he is weak in academics as he could not attend school regularly. Dhani agrees to tutoring him. Over the course of time, Dhani starts feeling sympathy for Thoithoi and starts inquiring about his parents to Gandhar's wife. From her, she comes to know that Pupu is Thoithoi's maternal grandfather. Gandhar tells Dhani that Thoithoi's grandfather was working as an attendant in the Inspection bungalow. He had a daughter Memtombi, who was free-spirited. An officer who was posted at the place and lived at the bungalow, seduced Memtombi, but soon got transferred. When Memtombi's father learned about his daughter's pregnancy, he went to tell the officer about it but the officer didn't come. Instead, he sent a man for Memtombi, to whom she refused. Memtombi died while giving birth to Thoithoi. After learning about the story, Dhani is disturbed and asks Gandhar about the officer. She comes to know that he is Dinachandra from Elang Leikai, who happens to be her cousin Ekashini's husband. She goes to meet him. But at the time, Dinachandra was out of station for a training programme, and also for meeting his son who was studying in Delhi. So, Dhani tells Ekashini about what all happened, to which Ekashini initially denies and refuses to believe. Ekashini goes to meet Thoithoi but isn't able to meet him it as he was not at home at that time. Pishak tells Thoithoi that his mother came to meet him. During the second time, he meets Ekashini, where he thinks that she is his mother. She brings clothes and snacks for him. After a brief meeting, when Ekashini is about to leave, Thoithoi asks her not to leave and starts crying. Ekashini leaves but feels the pain of separation with Thoithoi, who addresses her as mother. The next day, Thoithoi waits for her mother by the roadside. Soon, Thoithoi falls ill. Ekashini comes to visit him. She takes Thoithoi to her residence and also consults a doctor. Pupu doesn't want his grandson to be kept there. Dhani asks Ekashini to send Thoithoi back, but also tells her to admit Thoithoi to a nearby school. Ekashini looks after Thoithoi with utmost care and the mother-son relationship grows really strong. Meanwhile, Dinachandra returns home and starts inquiring Ekashini about Thoithoi. Ekashini does not disclose the story but only tells him that she adopted him just because she likes him and there won't be any problem with it afterwards. When she tells Dinachandra that the child is from the village where Dhani is posted, her husband insists that he will call Dhani to send the child back. Ekashini plans to make Thoithoi play the role of Lord Krishna for a Ras Leela performance, so she takes Thoithoi to a nearby Hindu temple for learning the dance regularly. During one of these days, Pupu comes to take Thoithoi where he meets Dinachandra. Pupu clarfies to him that he has no intention of making his grandson get adopted by a person who doesn't even want to adopt his own child and that, he himself is enough for Thoithoi. Dinachandra goes to call Ekashini and Thoithoi. Pupu tells Ekashini that he is taking Thoithoi back, to which Ekashini expresses her anger towards her husband for allowing it. She refuses and takes Thoithoi back to the Hindu temple. The grandfather, on seeing the mother-son bond, cries and leaves. The film ends with Ekashini correcting a step of the Thoithoi's Krishna dance, showing her love for her son, her precious.

Hellwig, U.S. Tax Court: an Historical Analysis. Sternhagen was born on March 21, 1888 in Mount Vernon, New York, the youngest of five children. His parents were Herman Sr. (1845‚Äì1925), a German-American immigrant, and Christina Sternhagen, a native of New York. Sternhagen's siblings included Amelia (b. 1879), Louisa (b. 1882), Ella Cornelia (b. 1883) and Herman Jr. (b. 1885). Sternhagen lived in Mount Vernon with his family for the entirety of his adolescence. In 1908, at age 20, he started working as a clerk at 229th Street, Columbus Avenue as well as on 10th and 11th Avenue. He became a secretary at 425th Street on 4th Avenue in 1914 when he was 26. By 1918, at age 30, Sternhagen was working as a secretary on 0 North, Kith Avenue. He was drafted in World War I, where he served as 2nd Lieutenant of the Air Service Division stationed in Washington DC. He never saw combat, but served honorably from October 25, 1918 until he was honorably discharged on January 30, 1919. On his return from service, Sternhagen settled in his home at 6 North Street, 15th Avenue in Mount Vernon. After four years, he returned to Chicago, Illinois, where he began working as a Republican Tax lawyer for hire,\\"Newly Appointed Tax Board To Be Organized At Once\\", The Baltimore Sun (July 4, 1924), p. 6. working at 106th South La Salle Street in 1923. When President Coolidge, with the guidance of Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, passed the Revenue Act of 1924, cutting overall taxes and establishing the U.S. Board of Tax Appeals. Coolidge selected 12 initial members of the board, most of them fellow Republicans, one of them being Sternhagen. He was one of a group of seven members of the Board appointed \\"from the public\\".Harold Dubroff and Brant J. Hellwig, U.S. Tax Court: an Historical Analysis (2015). Following Coolidge's appointment and Congress's confirmation, he took the oath of office with his fellow board members in the office of Under Secretary Garrard B. Wilson on July 16, 1924. Three years into his service, Sternhagen met and married Gertrude Hussey (b. 1894, d. 1977), a socialite and former war nurse during World War I. They married on April 29, 1927 in Manhattan, New York and moved to Washington DC in 1928. Sternhagen sold his stock options and bought a house on O Street. On January 13, 1930, their only daughter, Frances \\"Frannie\\" Sternhagen, was born in DC. The family became involved in many different facets of local political relations, including a long-time friendship with future Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, and his family. Sternhagen continued to serve on the Board until, in 1942, when it was converted into the Tax Court of the United States, thus making Sternhagen an official federal judge, and one of only two of the original board members to continue on to the Tax Court. It was around this time that his health began to deteriorate and his mind began to fail. He officially retired from the Tax Court on June 1, 1946. Sternhagen died in 1954 in Washington DC at the age of 66.\\"In Memoriam\\", Bulletin (American Bar Association. Section of Taxation), Vol. 8, No. 1 (OCTOBER 1954), p. 2.

She has published more than twenty-five books and dozens of articles and has written two award-winning plays. A math education expert, she is particularly interested in the math achievement of young girls. Long coined the phrase \\"latchkey children\\" with her husband Thomas Long and wrote the bestselling \\"Handbook for Latchkey Children and Their Working Parents.\\" She is President and Founder of the not-for-profit: Equal Visibility Everywhere. During the 2016 Democratic Presidential Primary, Long served as the Volunteer Florida State Organizer for Hillary Clinton. She was an at-large Delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Long is an American feminist and contributor to the feminist movement in the United States.  Education  Long graduated in 1969 from the University of Illinois with a Bachelor of Science in Zoology and Chemistry. Subsequent to her undergraduate studies, Lynette went on to acquire a master's degree in Mathematics and Ph.D. in Educational and Counseling Psychology.  Equal Visibility Everywhere  Long is the founder and president of Equal Visibility Everywhere (EVE), a not-for-profit which focuses on researching the under-representation of women on our nation's symbols and icons: currency, stamps, statues, Google Doodles, monuments and memorials, street names, and national holidays. Long was the first person to bring national attention to the fact that there was not a single woman represented on our nation's paper currency. As a result of her ground-breaking work and the efforts of other feminist groups, the Treasury Department will feature women on United States paper currency.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-04-30/news/bs-ed-women-on- currency-20100430_1_currency-alberta-women-suffrage https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2010/04/23/AR2010042304816.html Her research has brought national attention to the fact that only nine of the one hundred statues in National Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol honor women. Long has been instrumental in securing authorization for a statue of Amelia Earhart in the United States Capitol. Long has focused awareness around the country on the general lack of female statuary which has led to an increase in the number of statues of women commissioned. Long is also spearheading an effort to increase the number of Florida State Historical Markers honoring women. At the time of her initial research in 2017, only six of the 950 markers in the State of Florida specifically honored women. Since 2017, Long has successfully applied for and found funding for numerous Florida State Historical Markers honoring women including, Miami Beach Preservationist Barbara Baer Capitman, Author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Aviatrix Amelia Earhart, Doctor Eleanor Galt Simmons, and Seminole Chief Betty Mae Tiger Jumper. Long is a frequent public speaker often discussing her research on the lack of symbolic representation of women and its psychological impact on women and girls.  Latchkey Children  Long is responsible for coining the term latchkey kid and bringing to national attention the hidden plight of latchkey children. A former elementary and middle school principal, Long noticed her students wearing house keys on chains around their necks. She interviewed these students and found that they were often lonely or afraid during the two or three hours they spent home alone after school. These initial conversations led to exhaustive research, hundreds of interviews with latchkey children, their parents, and former latchkey children. The culmination of her work was published in The Handbook for Latchkey Children and Their Working Parents (with Thomas J. Long) and On My Own: The Kids Self-Care Book as well as in dozens of articles. Long's research has been reported by every major news outlet and in hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles.  Media Personality  Long has appeared on hundreds of radio and television programs as a child development expert including, The Today Show, Good Morning America, The Phil Donahue Show, Geraldo, and The Merv Griffin Show. She was selected as the national spokesperson for Thomas J. Lipton and Company and Pets are Wonderful. Long was the host of ONE ON ONE WITH DR. LYNETTE LONG a call-in radio program in Okinawa, Japan. The program was hosted by the Armed Forces Network and was aimed at helping U.S. Service Members discuss problems related to the stress of overseas service.

In 1999, he began writing the long prose-poem he called N30. This was the code-name of the 1999 Seattle protests organised during the WTO negotiations. The protesters were demanding a global recognition of fair trade, trade unions and environmental legislation. Seven years later, in 2006, Mettes had written a poem, 60,000 words long. In 2005, Jeroen Mettes started the blog Po√´zienotities (Poetry Notes). An important part of that blog was Poet Alphabet, in which Mettes discussed‚Äîin alphabetical order‚Äîthe poetry he found in Verwjis Bookstore, in his hometown of The Hague. He started with the A (Anne van Amstel), and would end with the G (Goudeseune). As a poet, Jeroen Mettes debuted in the journal Parmentier. In his early twenties, he had already contributed prose to, among other magazines, Zoetermeer and Passionate. In 2006, Mettes joined the editorial staff of the magazine yang, while continuing to write for Parmentier. On September 21, 2006, he published an empty post on his blog.

Its distribution may be somewhat masked by the difficulty of distinguishing this species from Zelotes apricorum and Zelotes latreillei. Description Zelotes subterraneus is one of a group shiny, all-black Zelotes species which are difficult to identify, the females being extremely similar and the males only being readily identifiable by reference to the tip of the embolus on the palps. The overall picture is additionally complicated by the apparent hybridisation between the two species in some areas, but this is disputed with some authorities claiming apparent hybrid characteristics may be the result of natural variation. The length of the female's body is 5.8-9.2 mm, while the smaller male is 3.8-7.8 mm long. Habitat and ecology Zelotes subterraneus has only been found in two types of habitat in Great Britain, under stones on mountains in the north of the island and in coastal habitats, mainly shingle, in the south-east. There is a strong possibility that, within Britain, Z. subterraneus has been misidentified as the more widespread Z. apricorum so Z. subterraneus may eventually be found to occur more widely. Elsewhere in Europe habitats utilised include woodland, heathland, dry meadows, boggy areas, under stones and bark and in the litter layer, up to 1300 m above sea level. Adults of both sexes have been recorded in late spring/early summer and late summer/autumn. The white egg sac is attached to the underside of stones and guarded by the female. It is an active, nocturnal hunter, running down and catching a variety of terrestrial arthropods including other species of small spiders. Distribution Zelotes subterraneus has a Palearctic distribution. In Europe it is frequently recorded in the north, and has been recorded from Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. In Great Britain it is found in mountains of central and eastern Scotland and northern England and in coastal areas of the south east of England. It tends to be distributed to the north and east of Zelotes apicorum on the continent and this seems to be mirrored in their respective British distributions.

Its name was changed to Stratheden Hospital in 1948. It was a centre of excellence in Child and Family Psychiatry from the 1960s. In the 21st century, it caters for psychiatric health. It is managed by NHS Fife. History =Early history= The hospital opened as the Fife and Kinross District Asylum on 1 July 1866. The first chief physician was John Batty Tuke. The hospital was extended at a cost of ¬£20,000 in 1896. A further two new wings were added in 1905. Following the introduction of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947 the name of the hospital changed to Stratheden Hospital on 7 July 1948. =A leading Child and Family Psychiatry Department= 1960 saw the arrival of Dr Douglas Haldane, an energetic and recently appointed young consultant child psychiatrist. He had the novel idea of calling his department \\"Child and Family Psychiatry\\", a name that was to catch on elsewhere. His unit was located at 'Playfield House' and was opened in the grounds of the hospital. As the label implied, it catered for children, adolescents and their families.Haldane, J. D., McCluskey, U. & Peacey, M. 'A Residential facility for families in Scotland: developments in prospect and retrospect'. International Journal of Family Psychiatry, 1, 357-372, 1980 Eventually, in 1975, two purpose-built buildings were set aside for the in-patient care for whole family groups, along the lines of the Cassel Hospital, south of the border.Obituaries: Douglas Haldane BMJ 2012; 345 doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.e6616 (Published 05 October 2012) retrieved 26 December 2016 The other consultant child psychiatrist appointed to the hospital was Dr Simon Lindsay, who had been a trainee of the distinguished child analyst Melanie Klein. Lindsay was said to have been the only direct Kleinian in the whole of Scotland. =Recent developments= In September 2014 Mrs Chrys Muirhead won an Ombudsman case against NHS Fife for the \\"unreasonable treatment\\" of her son in Stratheden Hospital. Mr Muirhead had been resident in the hospital in February 2012, and Mrs Muirhead had raised a number of complaints with the Fife Health Board, Fife Council Social Work and Fife Police throughout 2012. There was a locked seclusion room being used in the old intensive psychiatric care unit or Ward 4 at Stratheden which had no toilet, light or water, and Mrs Muirhead's son was locked in this room overnight, in the dark, unobserved, for hours at a time, with a broken hand untreated. When he needed the toilet no nurses appeared and Mr Muirhead had to defecate on the floor of the cell, following which, when still no nurses appeared, he did a dirty protest in his distress at being neglected. Plans for a new intensive psychiatric care unit (IPCU) at Stratheden were approved in 2014 and construction began in 2015 with funds awarded by Scottish Government. On 6 July 2015 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon joined NHS Fife chief executive Paul Hawkins in a sod-cutting ceremony at Stratheden Hospital and said \\"The Scottish Government is investing over ¬£2 billion in Scotland‚Äôs health infrastructure over the spending review period, with this development being one of many that demonstrate the Scottish Government‚Äôs commitment to continually improving health services.‚Äù The extension cost ¬£4.4 million and includes a communal lounge, rooms for rehabilitative and therapeutic activities, access to an outdoor courtyard, private meeting rooms for visits from families or visitors, an IT suite and eight new patient en-suite rooms.

He was a member of the \\"Sausalito Six\\" group of San Francisco Bay Area painters. Family and education James Budd Dixon was born to a well-to-do family in San Francisco, California. In the 1920s, he studied art at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was an illustrator for several campus publications. He served in the Army Air Forces in World War II, after which he returned to studying art under the G.I. Bill, this time at the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA, now the San Francisco Art Institute). Among his classmates at CSFA were other emerging Bay Area Abstract Expressionists, including Richard Diebenkorn, John Hultberg, Frank Lobdell, Walter Kuhlman, and George Stillman. They became known as the \\"Sausalito Six\\" because most lived in the waterfront town of Sausalito just north of San Francisco (Dixon was one of those who did not, but he frequently met there with the others). Throughout his life, Dixon supported himself in various ways, including as a commercial artist and an art director. In 1950 he became an instructor at CSFA; among his students there were Sonia Gechtoff, Byron McClintock, and Robert S. Neuman. Art career Dixon was both a painter and a printmaker. In the 1930s, he painted in a Social Realist style, and it wasn't until his years as a student at CSFA that he developed his characteristic mature style, inspired by the early work of Jackson Pollock. These later paintings featured dramatic strokes of brilliant, harsh color laid on in heavy impasto, while his prints and drawings were energized by vigorous lines. One critic considered him the most adventurous colorist among the first wave of Abstract Expressionists to emerge from the Bay Area. In 1948 he collaborated with other members of the Sausalito Six to create a portfolio of 17 lithographs entitled Drawings that is considered a landmark in the history of Abstract Expressionist printmaking. From the 1940s onwards, Dixon exhibited regularly at galleries and museums on the West Coast and occasionally elsewhere. His output became more sporadic after 1960 as a drinking problem accelerated, and he died in San Francisco in 1967. He is buried in Golden Gate National Cemetery next to his wife, Peggy Dixon (1892-1977). Most of his work is in the collection of the Oakland Museum (California), but a few pieces are held by the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian American Art Museum, among other institutions. A small collection of papers, photographs, and slides of Dixon's work is held by the Archives of American Art.

Subjective effects include both stimulating experiences typically occurring during the beginning of a drinking episode as breath alcohol content (BAC) rises and sedative effects, which are more prevalent later in a drinking episode as BAC wanes. The combined influence of hedonic and aversive subjective experiences over the course of a drinking session are strong predictors of alcohol consumption and drinking consequences. There is also mounting evidence for consideration of SR as an endophenotype with some studies suggesting that it accounts for a significant proportion of genetic risk for the development of alcohol use disorder.  Theoretical models  = Low Level of Response Model = The Low Level of Response Model proposes that individuals who are less sensitive to the effects of alcohol are at greater risk for developing alcohol use disorder. One explanation for this phenomenon is that the experiences of elevated intoxication constitutes a feedback mechanism, which prompts drinking cessation. Low-level responders need to consume more alcohol than high responders to achieve a similar level of intoxication and experience the aversive effects of alcohol; consequently, these individuals must consume more alcohol to trigger the negative feedback loop. Escalating alcohol consumption may ultimately contribute to the development of tolerance, which further dampens sensitivity to alcohol's unpleasant effects. Notably, there is no population-level demarcation separating low from high responders and so level of response is arbitrarily defined (generally in terciles) within a given sample. Early studies compared SR in individuals (mostly males) with (FH+) and without (FH-) a history of alcohol dependence in order to demonstrate that individual differences in SR could be considered genetically-linked determinants of alcohol use disorder. Non-placebo controlled studies conducted by Schuckit and colleagues found that FH+ males experienced less of the aversive effects of alcohol as compared to FH- males matched on key demographic and body mass variables. Furthermore, FH+ young males and their fathers showed similar SR after reaching peak BAC, suggesting that SR is a heritable risk factor for the development of alcohol use disorder. Schuckit's placebo-controlled studies generally reported lower SR among FH+, as compared to FH-, subjects along declining BAC, with differences more evident among men than women. Additional studies found that FH+ subjects who experienced low- level of response were more than 4 times as likely to meet criteria for alcohol use disorder at 10-year follow-up as compared to FH- subjects who reported the same SR pattern. Subsequent follow-up studies conducted primarily by Schuckit's group established that low-level of response is a genetically- linked risk factor for alcohol use disorder, which is not better explained by robust confounding factors such as age of first drink, current alcohol use and impulsivity. A 1992 meta-analysis further buttressed the Low Level of Response Model by reporting that sons of alcoholics exhibited lower responses to alcohol on both the ascending and descending limbs of the BAC curve. Importantly, differences in SR by family history were significant only in the alcohol condition and not the placebo condition, suggesting that SRs observed in the alcohol condition could be attributed to the pharmacological effects of alcohol, rather than to a confounding factor. A 2011 meta-analysis revealed that FH+ individuals reported lower SR in comparison to FH- individuals across both limbs of intoxication, consistent with the Low Level of Response Model. These findings were more robust along the descending limb of the BAC curve where sedative effects of alcohol are more prevalent and among males who comprised the overwhelming majority of participants in early SR studies. Critics noted that studies supporting the Low Level of Response Model only accounted for the negatively valenced sedative effects of alcohol and that while decreased sensitivity to aversive effects of alcohol would likely lead to increased drinking frequency and severity, the subjective effects of alcohol are, in actuality, quite varied. For example, it is widely accepted that the rewarding properties of alcohol are reinforcing. Yet, according to the Low Level of Response Model, reduced sensitivity to these rewarding effects is an indicator of problematic drinking. To that end, critics have noted that in Schuckit's seminal SR study, FH+ males experienced more \\"energy\\" than FH- males along rising BAC, suggesting that heightened sensitivity to the stimulating effects of alcohol may convey risk for developing alcohol problems. Another study found that FH+ subjects reported experiencing less intoxication than FH- subjects in response to a placebo drink, indicating that alcohol expectancies may account for differences in risk more so than SR. That is, individuals at greatest risk for developing alcohol use disorder may expect alcohol to be more enjoyable and less aversive than low-risk individuals. = Differentiator Model = The Differentiator Model is based on the widely accepted notion that alcohol's effects are biphasic. That is, the stimulating effects of alcohol (i.e., euphoria, sociality, energy) are more prevalent as BAC rises (i.e., ascending limb), while alcohol's sedative effects (i.e., relaxation, nausea, headaches) are experienced most strongly as BAC falls (i.e., descending limb). The Differentiator Model proposes that individuals at greatest risk for developing alcohol use disorder (or those who already meet criteria for alcohol use disorder) are more sensitive to the stimulating effects of alcohol on the ascending limb of intoxication and less sensitive to the sedative effects on the descending limb. Additionally, the combination of heightened rewards and diminished consequences over the course of a drinking episode increases motivation to consume alcohol, leading to longer and more frequent drinking episodes. Repeated engagement in these risky drinking occasions may ultimately contribute to the development of alcohol use disorder. Support for the Differentiator Model is mixed, perhaps reflecting the paucity of studies designed to test the model itself or record SR over both limbs of intoxication. Both oral and intravenous alcohol administration studies reported that FH+ subjects experienced elevated sensitivity to stimulating effects of alcohol along rising BAC, without the corresponding attenuation of sedative effects as BAC fell. A study using an intravenous alcohol clamping method (participants were titrated to a BAC of .06 g/dl whereupon alcohol was infused to maintain a stable BAC for the duration of the study) reported that FH+ subjects experienced heightened stimulation on the ascending limb of intoxication, consistent with the Differentiator Model. However, FH+ subjects reported decreased stimulation during clamping, indicative of acute tolerance. Findings by King and colleagues, which are largely corroborated by a recent meta-analysis, suggest that the Differentiator Model best characterizes heavy drinkers at risk for developing alcohol use disorder. Specifically, over the course of several studies, heavy drinkers reported greater positive SR on the ascending limb of intoxication and lower negative SR on the descending limb, in relation to light drinkers. Increased sensitivity to alcohol's stimulating effects along rising BAC and muted sensitivity to alcohol's sedative effects along waning BAC were subsequently predictive of future increases in binge drinking, blackouts, hangovers and alcohol use disorder symptomatology.  Measurement  The Subjective High Assessment Scale (SHAS) captures sensations frequently associated with intoxication such as \\"clumsy,\\" \\"dizzy,\\" \\"drunk\\" and \\"high\\" and was administered extensively in early SR studies. The SHAS is typically administered as a visual analog scale, allowing subjects to rate the extent to which they experienced each symptom during a given experiment. Critics of the measure argue that it primarily captures the sedative effects of alcohol while omitting many of alcohol's stimulating properties. The Biphasic Effects of Alcohol Scale (BAES) assesses 7 stimulating (elated, energized, excited stimulated, talkative, up, vigorous) and 7 sedative (difficulty concentrating, down, heavy head, inactive, sedated, slow thoughts, sluggish) effects of alcohol along an 11-point scale. Studies supporting the Differentiator Model have almost universally used the BAES, rather than the SHAS, as a measure of SR. Critics of the BAES assert that it does not adequately capture positive sedative effects. The Subjective Effects of Alcohol Scale (SEAS) was published in 2013 to address this apparent limitation by referencing positive and negative stimulating and sedative effects; to date, this scale has not been widely used in alcohol challenge studies.  Genetic moderators  Most genetic studies in addiction research focus on the genetic determinants of diagnostic phenotypes such as alcohol use disorder. However, because the causes of alcohol use disorder are so numerous and varied, researchers have turned their attention to endophenotypes, or distinct, genetically-linked phenotypes associated with a broad disorder. Endophenotypes are especially useful in addictions research because they are more closely linked to genetic variations than the broad disorder. Therefore, investigators have explored the effects of genetic variation in the endogenous opioid system and the GABAergic system on SR. Alcohol activates endogenous opioid receptors, potentiating dopamine release which increases the rewarding effects of alcohol. To that end, the A118G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1), has garnered much interest as a potential moderator of SR. Numerous laboratory studies have demonstrated that G-allele carriers experience the stimulating, hedonic effects of alcohol more strongly than A homozygotes. However, a study of non-treatment seeking participants with alcohol dependence found that A homozygotes experienced more stimulation than G carriers, and a study of heavy drinkers reported no differences in SR between OPRM1 genotype. These mixed findings may stem from differences in alcohol use severity among samples, as the allostatic model of addiction contends that individuals shift from reward to relief drinking as alcohol use disorder progresses. Thus, it is possible that social drinkers and individuals with mild alcohol use disorder may experience the hedonic effects of alcohol as most salient while individuals with more severe alcohol use disorder may consume alcohol for its negative reinforcing properties (i.e., to reduce withdrawal symptoms). The use of retrospective, instead of real time, self- reports of SR as well as differences in ethnicities of samples may further contribute to discrepancies in studies exploring the effects of the OPRM1 gene and SR. Taken together, the literature pertaining to the expression of SR by OPRM1 genotype suggests that the A118G SNP of the OPRM1 gene is associated with enhanced sensitivity to the stimulating, but not sedative, effects of alcohol. Expression of the DAT1 dopamine transporter gene has also been shown to predict severity of alcohol use disorder symptoms with a recent study linking simultaneous carriers of the OPRM1 G-allele and DAT1 A10 allele homozygotes to pleasurable subjective effects along rising BAC. Alcohol researchers have also evaluated the role of gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors as moderators of SR. Most investigation has focused on genes coding for GABAA receptors, which are involved in dopamine release. Some studies have linked GABRA2 and GABRG1 genes to reductions in the experience of positive and negative subjective effects.  Clinical implications  Because SR is such a strong predictor of future alcohol consumption and problems, medication development has focused on drugs which either reduce the pleasant or increase the unpleasant effects of alcohol. Naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, is frequently prescribed to patients suffering from alcohol use disorder, with moderate effectiveness. Studies have demonstrated that naltrexone reduces the stimulating and heightens the aversive sedative effects of alcohol in individuals at-risk for alcohol use disorder, contributing to decreases in self-reported subjective high and liking of alcohol. Only one study has reported on the effects of naltrexone on SR in a sample of participants with alcohol dependence: naltrexone, in comparison to a placebo, attenuated subjective stimulation within 10 minutes of administration of a moderate dose of alcohol, but not thereafter. Laboratory studies have shown that OPRM1 genotype moderates the subjective effects of naltrexone in social and heavy drinkers, such that G carriers reported reduced sensitivity to the stimulating effects of alcohol. Moreover, a placebo-controlled study of heavy drinkers of East Asian descent demonstrated that G carriers experienced greater sensitivity to alcohol's aversive effects as compared to A homozygotes. There is limited evidence suggesting that quetiapine and varenicline increase the aversive effects of alcohol.

Primarily an enemy of Spider-Man, the organization exists within Marvel's main shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe. Created by writer David Michelinie and artist Todd McFarlane, it first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1, #298 (March 1988).  Publication history  The Life Foundation was introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1, #298-299 and went on to appear in The Amazing Spider-Man #320-321, The Amazing Spider-Man #324 and The Amazing Spider-Man #351-352, as well as the \\"Hero Killers\\" storyline that ran through The Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol. 1, #26, The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual Vol. 1, #12, Web of Spider-Man Annual Vol. 1, #8 and The New Warriors Annual Vol. 1, #2, and was subsequently featured in Venom: Lethal Protector #3-5 and Spider-Man: The Arachnis Project #1-6, and made its last appearance to date in a flashback sequence in Venom: Separation Anxiety #2.  Fictional organization history  A sophisticated and unscrupulous corporate survivalist group, the Life Foundation was founded in response to Cold War paranoia, and is dedicated to constructing doomsday-proof communities for both its own members and society's elite who can reserve a spot in these facilities for a minimum payment of $5,000,000. The Life Foundation hires Chance to steal European armaments being shipped to Manhattan, offering $25,000. Chance reports back to the Life Foundation after the heist, but is knocked out and taken prisoner by the group's leader Carlton Drake. Drake has Chance brought to his survivalist facility Sanctum Maximus in New Jersey, and orders that Chance be tortured into revealing how the mercenary's powered exoskeleton works to be mass- produced for the Life Foundation's benefit. Spider-Man discovers and releases Chance, and the two destroy the Life Foundation's base. Months later, the Life Foundation has the foreign client Chakane due to plotting to assassinate the king of Symkaria, planning to take up residence in the Life Foundation and guarded by mindless superhuman \\"Protectors\\". Silver Sable gets wind of their scheme, and acquires more information pertaining to their conspiracy by interrogating Chakane and Drake after Spider-Man and Paladin help break into the Life Foundation's new underground city built in New Jersey yet Drake's resources prevent any prosecution. Spider-Man and Solo afterward capture Toler Weil, Chakane's ally who the Life Foundation had hidden in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Afterwards, Drake has the Tri-Sentinel rebuilt and reprogrammed by the Life Foundation, which loses control of the machine when the directives originally given by Loki reassert over the new ones programmed into it by the Life Foundation. Spider-Man and Nova are able to obliterate the Tri-Sentinel using a piece of Antarctic vibranium, but lose a disc containing incriminating information about the Life Foundation's illegal activities while Drake has his men gather all the data and once again evade capture. The Life Foundation (led by Drake) subsequently appears as one of the corporations involved in the Sphinx's attempt at finding a way to lucratively duplicate the powers of captured superhumans, a plot foiled by Spider-Man and the New Warriors. Scream, Riot, Agony, Phage and Lasher) in Venom: Lethal Protector #4 (May 1993). Art by Ron Lim. Treece International's CEO Roland Treece later has the Life Foundation assist in dealing with Venom interfering with Treece's search for a lost stockpile of gold supposedly buried somewhere beneath a park in San Francisco. At their Mojave facility, Drake has the Life Foundation experiment with the Venom symbiote which extracts five additional symbiotes which bonded with their own mercenaries: Scream, Riot, Agony, Phage and Lasher. The Life Foundation's symbiote enforcers commit random acts of violence throughout San Francisco to test their capabilities, drawing Spider- Man's attention to follows back to the Life Foundation situated in the Mojave Desert. Spider-Man and Eddie Brock team-up to combat the symbiotes, seemingly killing the creatures and depowering their hosts, a development that prompts the Life Foundation (led by Drake) into abandoning and destroying the Mojave facility. Unknown to the Life Foundation, their five symbiote enforcers somehow survive the explosion and rebel against before fleeing to New York City. Setting up anew in Washington, D.C., the Life Foundation hires the Jury and the mercenary Spoiler to replace their symbiote warriors, and steals artifacts and other valuables to stockpile in their doomsday bunkers due to still believing in World War III. With Drake diagnosed with terminal cancer, the Life Foundation pose as a government branch and offer funding to Toshiro Mikashi, an entomology professor working on an arachnid-based cure for cancer and other ailments called the Arachnis Project. Mikashi eventually realizes who his backers really are and that they intend to exploit this work to create a new race of Homo Arachnis so the Life Foundation keeps Mikashi compliant by threatening his daughter Miho. When one of Mikashi's students stumbles upon the research, the Life Foundation has this student murdered, an act that draws the suspicions of Peter Parker (one of Mikashi's students) to Washington. After Mikashi reveals his involvement with the Life Foundation to Parker, the organization abducts the professor and his daughter, spurring Spider-Man into allowing himself to be captured by the Jury in order to discern the Mikashis' whereabouts. Mikashi reluctantly completes the Arachnis Project formula by using a sample of Spider-Man's DNA which is given to Treece who injects Drake with, intending for the serum to kill (as it was meant to be ingested) and thus allow Treece to usurp the Life Foundation. The concoction instead successfully transforms Drake into the Homo Arachnis which goes on rampage, devouring the Life Foundation's personnel while combating Spider-Man as well as Venom and the mutinying Jury. After Venom traps Drake and evacuates with everyone else in the installation, Mikashi sacrifices himself by sabotaging the Life Foundation's nuclear reactor in order to cause an explosion that will eliminate all of the Arachnis Project's traces. The blast is contained by the facility's shielding, preventing from affecting Washington. The unfazed spider creature afterward digs itself out of the base's remains and sheds its exoskeleton to reveal Drake with a youthful and healthy and swearing revenge on Spider-Man, the Jury, and Venom. At some point, the Life Foundation declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy and Mendel Stromm had raided one of their abandoned shelters to unearth and reactivate the Tri-Sentinel.

She was a durable sprinter who raced in five countries and won nine of her 36 races between April 1991 and November 1995. Competing mainly in minor races early in her career she won once in 1991 and three times in the following year. She was moved up in class as four-year-old and recorded major victories in both the Prix du Petit Couvert in France and the Premio Umbria in Italy. In the following year she showed her best form in autumn, producing a career-best performance to take the Haydock Sprint Cup in England and winning the Premio Chiusura in Italy. She was less successful as a six-year-old, but did add a second win in the Premio Chiusura before being retired from racing. As a broodmare she produced two minor winners from six foals. Background Lavinia Fontana was a chestnut mare with a small white star bred in Ireland by Denis Brosnan. She was owned during her racing career by the art dealer Cyril Humphris who named the filly was named after an Italian painter. She was initially sent into training with Con Collins at The Curragh in County Kildare. She was one of the best horses sired by Sharpo, a sprinter whose wins included three consecutive runnings of the William Hill Sprint Championship. His other offspring included College Chapel (winner of the Prix Maurice de Gheest), Penny Drops (Sandown Mile), Sharp Prod (Mo√´t & Chandon Rennen), Gorse (Holsten-Trophy), Port Lucaya (Premio Vittorio di Capua), Sharpical (Tote Gold Trophy) and Dark 'n Sharp (Red Rum Handicap Chase). Lavinia Fontana's dam Belle Origine was a Kentucky-bred mare who never raced, but was descended from Easy Lass, the dam of Coaltown and Wistful. Racing career =1991 & 1992: early career= In 1991 Lavinia Fontana finished unplaced in minor races at April and May at the Curragh Racecourse before contesting a maiden race over six furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 6 July. Ridden by P V Gilson she started the 5/4 favourite and won by a head from the Dermot Weld-trained Evocative. Lavinia Fontana spent 1992 in Ireland, running mainly in minor sprint races. After finishing unplaced in her first three starts she finished second in a handicap race over five furlongs at Tralee on 23 August and then recorded her first success of the year over the same course and distance three days later. She then ran three times in handicaps over six furlongs at the Curragh finishing third on 3 September, winning two weeks later before producing her best performance up to that time on 10 October when she won by eight lengths from Felsen on yielding ground. On her final appearance of the season the filly was moved up in class and distance for the Listed Garnet Stakes at Naas and finished second to the Jim Bolger-trained Nordic Pageant having briefly taken the lead in the final furlong. In October 1992 the filly was entered in the Goffs sale but was withdrawn before the auction. =1993: four-year-old season= Lavinia Fontana began her third season by finishing third in a minor stakes race at Leopardstown Racecourse in March and then showed improved form to finish second to Asema in the Athasi Stakes at the Curragh in April. In the following month she contested her first Group race and finished sixth of the fourteen runners behind College Chapel in the Greenlands Stakes at the Curragh. After a break of three months she returned to the track and finished unplaced behind the colt Bradawn Breever in handicaps at the Curragh on 21 August and 18 September. On 2 October in the Listed Waterford Testimonial Stakes she came out second best to Bradawn Breever, beaten a head after sustained struggle in the final furlong. The filly was sent overseas for the first time when she contested the Group Three Prix du Petit Couvert over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 24 October. Ridden by Frankie Dettori she took the lead 200 metres and won by two and a half lengths from the three-year-old filly Palacegate Episode with Zieten (winner of the Middle Park Stakes) a further two and a half lengths back in third. Lavinia Fontana was then sent to Italy for the Group Two Premio Umbria over 1200 metres at Capannelle Racecourse in Rome on 21 November. Racing on heavy ground and ridden by Alan Munro she took the lead approaching the last 200 metres and went clear of the field to win by two lengths from Branston Abby. =1994: five-year-old season= Before the start of the 1994 season Lavinia Fontana was transferred to England and joined the stable of John Dunlop at Arundel in West Sussex. On her first appearance for her new trainer she finished fourth to College Chapel in the Greenlands Stakes and then made a promising British debut when she finished second to the outstanding racemare Lochsong in the Temple Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse on 24 May. In July she started a 33/1 outsider for the July Cup at Newmarket Racecourse and finished last of the nine runners behind Owington before being sent to France for the Prix Maurice de Gheest and producing a much better effort on softer ground as she finished third behind Dolphin Street and Catrail. On 3 September Lavinia Fontana was one of eight horses to contest the Sprint Cup over six furlongs at Haydock Park and was ridden for the first time by Jason Weaver. In a race run in driving rain she started the 11/2 fourth choice in the betting behind Owington, Unblest (Champagne Stakes) and Zieten. The other four runners were Piccolo, Stack Rock (Hopeful Stakes), Blyton Lad (Rous Stakes) and Tabook. In a change of tactics the mare went to the front after two furlongs and set the pace before accelerating clear of the field in the final furlong. She won \\"comfortably\\" by three and a half lengths from Piccolo with the favourite Owington half a length away in third. Lavinia Fontana made four more appearances in the late autumn of 1994. In October she finished seventh to Lochsong in the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp and then ran unplaced behind Bigstone in the Prix de la For√™t over 1400 metres at the same track. On 9 November she was sent to Italy again for the Group Three Premio Chiusura over 1400 metres on heavy ground at the San Siro Racecourse in Milan. Ridden by Giovanni Forte she led from the start and won \\"very easily\\" by two and a quarter lengths from the four-year-old colt Taufan Black. The mare ended her season by attempting to repeat her 1993 success in the Premio Umbria but finished unplaced behind the Peter Chapple- Hyam-trained Thousla Rock. =1995: six-year-old season= As a six-year-old, Lavinia Fontana did not appear until June, when she finished second to Les Boyer in the Premio Emilio Turati over 1600 metres in Milan. She was then off the course until August when she finished sixth to Cherokee Rose in the Prix Maurice de Gheest and was then sent to Germany where she finished second to Hever Golf Rose in the Goldene Peitsche. In September she attempted to repeat her 1994 success in the Haydock Sprint Cup but finished last of the six runners behind Cherokee Rose and on 1 October she ran fifth behind Hever Golf Rose in the Prix de l'Abbaye. On 4 Milan the mare ran for the second time in the Premio Chiusura and was again partnered by Giovanni Forte. After tracking the leaders she took the lead 200 metres from the finish and stayed on well to win by half a length from Imprevedibile. On her final racecourse appearance Lavinia Fontana finished sixth behind Beat of Drums in the Premio Umbria on 19 November. Breeding record Lavinia Fontana was retired from racing to become a broodmare. She produced at least six foals and two minor winners between 1998 and 2007: *Oreana, a bay filly, foaled in 1998, sired by Anabaa. Won one race in England. *Esgrima, filly, 1999, by Sadler's Wells. Failed to win in two races. *La Tintoretta, bay filly, 2000, by Desert Prince. Won one race in Ireland. *Epitimos Proedros, bay colt, 2005, by Red Ransom. Unraced. *Crimson Mist, bay colt (later gelded), 2006, by Red Ransom. Failed to win in three races. *Rodrigo Fontana, colt (later gelded), 2007, by Red Ransom. Failed to win in two races.

Early life Antoine was born in Texas. Information on Antoine is scarce until his admission to Guadalupe College in Seguin, Texas, where he took sessions in algebra and Latin. Guadalupe College was one of the first African American schools of higher education situated in Southern Texas. In 1906, Antoine graduated from Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee and soon after married. Along with several school colleagues, Antoine opened a practice in Houston.http://classweb.uh.edu/cph/tobearfruit/resources_bios_antione.html Military Service In 1917, Dr. Antoine volunteered for service in France during World War I and reported to the Fort Des Moines Medical Officers Training Camp. After remaining in the camp for 38 days, Dr. Antoine transferred first to Camp Fuston, then Camp Logan. He was assigned to the 370th Infantry Regiment of the 93rd Division, which was composed mostly of African-American soldiers from the Illinois National Guard. Dr. Antoine was given the title First Lieutenant and got assigned to Depot Company K as a medical doctor. Fearing the threat of race riots coming from Camp Logan, Dr. Antoine and his unit were sent to France on the SS President Grant in 1918, and were handed to French command by order of General Pershing.http://memory.loc.gov:8081/ammem/today/jul15.html An assessment of the 370th's performance indicates that during the fall offensive of September 15, 1918, the division was able to fight off the enemy and keep steady. When the war ended, First Lieutenant Antoine assisted the transfer of injured troops to New York and Texas to ensure proper medical care. He was discharged on February 23, 1919. Career Antoine returned home and continued running his practice in Houston, Texas for the next 20 years. He practiced at the Houston Negro Hospital and was active in the Lone Star State Medical Dental, and Pharmaceutical Association, later becoming its vice-president in 1928. Death and legacy On August 17, 1939, Antoine died of heart disease and was mentioned in an obituary for the Chicago Defender. Funeral services were conducted in his residence at Houston. A street in Houston, Antoine Drive, was named after him in respect to his service to the Houston community, both as a soldier and physician. One of Houston's American Legion Posts was named in his honor. Personal life Antoine was married to 19-year-old Lottie Voliver in 1906 and moved in with her and her six-year-old nephew in Arkansas before returning to Texas. They had one daughter together named Mattie Louise, born 1925. Lottie died on October 5, 1927. Shortly before his death, Dr. Antoine married a woman named Zella.

Life Eduard Christian Scharlau Alberti was born in Friedrichstadt, at that time in the Duchy of Schleswig. He attended school in his hometown and then, between 1844 and Easter 1848, undertook a training in printing and book production (\\"Buchdruck\\"). He then returned to school, switching to a Gelehrtenschule (Pre-university academy) in nearby Husum. In 1850, in further pursuit of his academic objectives, he enrolled at the University of Kiel where, primarily under the supervision of Peter Wilhelm Forchhammer, he studied classical philology, passing his final exams in the first part of 1854. After this, till 1856 Alberti worked as a home tutor in Schwansen, employed by the family of the jurist-politician . At the same time he worked on his doctorate (PhD) which he received in July 1856. In 1857, after a lengthy stay in Copenhagen, he received his habilitation (higher academic qualification), still from Kiel University. At the same time he was working as an assistant at the university library, where in 1868 he was promoted to the position of \\"deputy custos\\".

He was born in Saint-P√®re-en- Retz and studied at the Missions Africains de Lyon seminary. He was ordained a priest in 1902. He briefly worked in Senegal before being sent to Dahomey. In 1903, he was named vicar of Abomey, and soon took on several other administrative roles in Porto-Novo. Aupiais was reassigned to Dakar from 1915 to 1918. At the end of World War I, he returned to Dahomey and served as director of mission schools. Aupiais was an important religious figure and helped advance the careers of Paul Hazoum√© and Sourou-Migan Apithy.Houngnikpo & Decalo 2013, p. 67 In 1925, Aupiais founded the journal La Reconnaissance Africaine, striving to publish ethnographic studies by Dahomeyans and popularize African culture abroad. He was a strident admirer of the indigenous culture and integrated traditional music, costumes and dances into religious celebrations. In 1926, he returned to Paris and sought to end forced labor in the colonies and joined the executive committee of the annual Louvain Missiology Week. Aupiais studied at the newly opened Institute of Ethnology in Paris from 1926 to 1928. That year, he became Provincial of the Lyon Province SMA, serving until 1931. Between 1929-1930 he produced two films, one a documentary on Catholic mission efforts in Dahomey, Le Dahomey Chr√©tien, the other an ethnographic film of traditional religious ceremonies, Le Dahomey religieux, which was censored in 1931. In 1938, he published Le Missionnaire, an overview of his colonial life and work in Africa. The following year, his ethnological work led to him being admitted to the Academy of Colonial Sciences. Although he lived in France during this period, he frequently travelled to Porto-Novo. On 18 October 1945, he was elected to serve as the first representative from Dahomey in the French Assembly, together with Apithy. However, he fell ill and died on 14 December 1945 in France, never joining parliament. He was succeeded by fellow missionary Pierre Bertho.

McGaw was a noted philanthropist who was particularly active in the Evanston, Illinois and Northwestern University area. He founded the American Hospital Supply Corporation, now a part of Baxter International. At the time of its founding, the AHSC was the largest medical supply company in the world. Biography =Early life= Foster G. McGaw was born in Hot Springs, North Carolina while his father, Francis A. McGaw, was on a missionary trip to the area for his occupation as a Presbyterian minister. His mother, Alice Millar, was a music teacher. The family spent much of McGaw‚Äôs formative years in Keokuk, Iowa where he attended grammar school and high school. At the age of 18, McGaw was approached by the owner of a surgical instrument company who offered him a job in Chicago. McGaw worked at this surgical instrument company for three years before enlisting in the United States Marine Corps in 1918. However, he soon returned to Chicago after one year to take a position at another medical supplies company as a salesman. After learning all about hospital supply buying trends and realizing that he was much more competent than his current employer, McGaw made the decision to leave the company and start his own enterprise. =Family and Children= McGaw‚Äôs first wife, Mary Harrison, died in 1919, shortly after he left the military. He married his second wife, Mary Wettling McGaw (n√©e Vail), in June 1949. Mary Wettling had a son and daughter from her previous marriage. James D. Vail would eventually join the family business and work for McGaw‚Äôs company, the American Hospital Supply Corporation. Jeanne Vail would eventually become the namesake of Northwestern University‚Äôs Vail Chapel. =Career= McGaw began the American Hospital Supply Corporation in 1922; it would then become the industry leader in medical supply manufacturing and distribution throughout the World War II era. Based in Evanston, nearly 2,500 locals worked for the company by the 1970s. At its peak, sales reached around $150 million and AHSC sold to 95% of American hospitals. In 1985, Baxter Travenol Laboratories, now Baxter International, purchased the company for $3.8 billion. =Death= McGaw died of illness on April 16, 1986, in Lake Forest, Illinois. He was 89 years old. To celebrate McGaw, his wife created a scholarship program for his company, the American Hospital Supply Corporation; the scholarships offered financial aid to employees at his company. Philanthropy and Legacy Inspired by his missionary father, McGaw strove to be an active member of his local community and engaged in philanthropic activities around the Chicago metropolitan area. When asked about the biggest factor that contributed to his company‚Äôs success, he cited their ‚Äúeffort to give more than we get.‚Äù McGaw's name lives on after his death: he is recognized for his work in hospital supply through the Foster G. McGaw prize, and is also remembered for his multiple donations to schools in Illinois, especially Northwestern University, where he was on the board of trustees. In addition to his activity at Northwestern University, McGaw was an active member of the Evanston community. He was a director of the Evanston Presbyterian home and funded the construction of the Evanston YMCA. =Foster G. McGaw Prize= The Foster G. McGaw Prize was created in 1986, by the Baxter Allegiance Foundation and the American Hospital Association, the Foster G. McGaw Prize recognizes hospitals that have marked themselves as exemplary by improving the health and well-being of everyone in their communities. The award is set in the belief that the relationship between communities and hospitals is, and should be, different than any other organization. The award honors hospitals that show a commitment to bettering the environment of both the hospital and the community. =McGaw Medical Center= Named after McGaw for his large donations and commitment to medicine and located in downtown Chicago, the McGaw Medical Center serves as a top-ranked institution at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Chartered in 1966, the McGaw Medical Center \\"is an Illinois not-for-profit corporation that sponsors, administers, and supports graduate medical education\\". The center links the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine to hospitals in Chicago and beyond and places students for their training. = McGaw Memorial Hall = In tribute to his father, Francis A. Mcgaw, Foster G. McGaw donated to the construction of McGaw Memorial Hall in 1953. It was built with the intent to hold the entire Northwestern student body, and had partitions, portable bleachers, and a removable basketball floor to allow for many different uses. At the time of construction, it was one of the largest auditoriums in the Chicago area. It lent its space to the North Shore Music Festival, and the Second Assembly of World Council of Churches, which showcased a convocation address by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1983 the hall underwent renovations to suit the growing university‚Äôs needs, and the interior spaces of the building are now named Welsh-Ryan Arena and the Ronald J. Chinnock Lobby to recognize large contributors to the remodel. = McGaw YMCA = The Evanston YMCA was founded in 1885 to ‚Äúpromote mental, moral, physical and social welfare‚Äù. After a major donation from the Foster McGaw family, the Evanston YMCA was renamed the McGaw YMCA and continues to serve roughly 20,000 people in the community each year. The McGaw YMCA works to remind members of their core values: caring, honesty, respect, and responsibility. They promote growth in spirit, mind, and body and work closely with the city of Evanston to strengthen the community.

Subjects of protests include anti-war sentiments, black student relations, and more.  Historical Key Events  = Student Power Marches and Student-Faculty Anti- War Protests = In the spring of 1967, Ellis Pines, a sophomore theater major, ran for president of the student government (student senate) on a \\"student power\\" platform. During the final days of the campaign, he held \\"bitch-ins\\" at the Rock, a centrally located student landmark, which led to two marches to the 619 Clark Street administration office. In response to the second march, two university leaders, Dean Payson Wild and Vice-president Franklin Kreml, came onto the steps of the building as Mr. Pines fielded questions from several hundred random (non-radical, non-organized) students while local TV stations recorded the event. The presence of the university officials gave some credibility to the campaign, and Mr. Pines narrowly won the election by 83 votes. Archival documents referenced seem to associate this protest with a Vietnam War teach-in that happened in the same month, indicating that \\"in April 1967, the first anti-war rally took place on the Northwestern campus in the form of a Vietnam teach-in.\\" Careful reading, however, shows that the events were concurrent but not connected. According to Ellis Pines himself, this demonstration, the first of its kind at the university, took place during his candidacy and was not directed against the Vietnam War. Rather it focused on \\"student life\\" issues, i.e. parietal hours, open occupancy in Evanston housing for African-American students, greater autonomy in pursuing a creative education, etc. A faculty member, the late political science instructor Edward W. \\"Ted\\" Gude, took Mr. Pines aside during the campaign and told him that he would have faculty support so long as he addressed campus but not international issues. Mr. Pines complied, and he said nothing about Vietnam during his campaign and brief tenure in office. The international pledge, however, was broken when the distinguished and popular Slavic Languages and Literature Professor Irwin Weil approached Mr. Pines about sending a supportive message to President Lyndon Johnson on behalf of Israel from the Student Senate on the eve of the Six Day War (June 1967). Professor Weil was concerned that academia's opposition to the Vietnam War would be misconstrued as general anti-war opposition to President Johnson should he need to use force in the Middle East situation. Although Mr. Pines agreed to Professor Weil's request in bringing the matter to the attention of the Student Senate, he also invited officers from Chicago's Arab nation consulates to participate in what became a rousing but polite debate with the Israel advocates. At a later time, Professor Gude did participate in a Vietnam teach-in. On April 27, 1967, a demonstration by the name \\"Gentle Thursday\\" took place outside Harris Hall in view of the weekly NROTC drill on Deering Meadow. It was described that \\"the gathering resembled a student carnival more than a protest by militants.\\" = Dow Chemical Company Demonstration = In early February 1968, students heard news of the Dow Chemical Company, the producer of the chemical weapon on napalm, recruiting on campus and began protesting. Starting at 60 and growing to 500 strong, the peaceful student demonstration on February 14, 1968 \\"articulated anti-war sentiment\\". A statement about the university's recruiting processes was released by the Director of Placement the day before the demonstration on February 13, 1968. It stated that \\"it is the policy of Northwestern University to help its students find employment. To that end, placement services are provided... Student groups have asked... 'Should the Dow Chemical Company be permitted to recruit at Northwestern?' My answer, in accordance with the policy I have stated, is yes.Northwestern University. Office of Placement. Statement Regarding the Recruitment of Employers by Northwestern University. Evanston: Frank S. Endicott, 1968. Print.\\" While the university ultimately did not change its decision to allow Dow on campus, Dean Roland J Hinz showed his support and concern for the cause saying that \\"It was a cracking good demonstration... [and] it may have an effect on university policy\\". = Black Student Sit-Ins (Apr. - Oct. 1968) = In May 1968, Northwestern's black students organized a sit-in in of the university Bursar's office to advocate for better race relations on campus. They hoped to persuade the administration to concede to their demands for increased admissions and financial aid, for black students, \\"In organizing the Black Student Sit-In of May, 1968, students occupying the university Bursar's office wanted the university to improve race relations on campus by persuading the administration to concede to their formal demands. Included in these demands were increased admissions and financial aid for black students, creation of an all-black dorm and student center, addition of a Black Studies curriculum, and desegregation of the university's real estate holdings in Evanston. These records combine official statements from the university administration, the student protestors, the negotiations between the two, policy statements and press coverage of the sit- in.\\" \\"lack of communication between students and administration lead to a sit in on may 3 and 4 by the university's black students. the students sat outside the bursar's office with a list of 15 demands and grievances about how they felt they fit into the NU community. They sat there until their concerns were heard\\" = Medical School Sit-In = Northwestern medical students conducted a Sit-In against compulsory draft of medical school students to the army in May 1970. The Sit-In protested medical troop participants being drafted as combat soldiers as part of national service, and called to attention disparity of socioeconomic status and black populations in the medical student community. = Protests on Vietnam = Students and faculty of Northwestern held demonstrations against American involvement in the Vietnamese war. The demonstrations took place from 1969 to 1973, raising tension between intervention supporters and strong opposers in the student and faculty populations. The administration was confronted with accounting for the free expression of all perspectives, and maintaining a neutral stance in lieu of controversy.  Contemporary Student Activism  = Black House Protests = Proposed changes to the Black House in 2015 sparked Black student unrest During the summer of 2015, Northwestern's Black community received an email summarizing the university's intentions to integrate the Black House with Multicultural Student Affairs. The email immediately sparked activism from both Black alumni and current students alike. Many felt that the lack of inclusion of the Black community on the decision was an infringement of the 1968 Agreement to improve the Black student experience from which the Black House was born. The university intended to move staff into the top floor of the house, and students responded asking to be involved in the decisions regarding changes to the space central to their experience. Listening sessions ensued, and according to Northwestern's Black Alumni Association, the community is now advocating the modernization of the space to make it not only a meeting space and resource center, but also the home of Northwestern's Black Student archives. = NU Divest = \\"After the June meeting, divestment leaders from Unshackle NU, NU Divest and Fossil Free NU, as well as Associated Student Government were under the impression that the University would drop two major components of the charter. One was that University President Morton Schapiro has to approve all voting members of the committee, and the other was that Chief Investment Officer Will McLean only has to forward recommendations of the committee to the Board of Trustees if he concurs. However, according to a copy of the charter obtained by The Daily, both components remained as of two weeks ago. \\" \\"Three divestment campaigns are currently pushing for changes to the University's investments: In early March, ASG Senate passed an Unshackle NU-sponsored resolution that calls on the University to divest from corporations the group says promote mass incarceration. Last February, after a tense five hours of debate, Senate narrowly passed a Northwestern Divest- sponsored resolution that called on the University to divest from six corporations the authors say violate Palestinians‚Äô human rights. As for coal divestment, Fossil Free NU has pushed the University to divest from fossil fuels since November 2014. In an online referendum held during ASG's presidential election in April 2015, almost three-quarters of voters said the University should divest from coal. Divestment movements at Northwestern date back decades: In the 1980s, student activists lobbied the University to divest from companies doing business in Apartheid-era South Africa. Later movements targeted corporations operating in Burma and Sudan, both of which activists said violated human rights.\\" = Athlete Unionization = In the winter of 2014 Cain Kolter, then two year starting quarterback for the Northwestern University football team, held a meeting with Head Coach Pat Fitzgerald to express concerns about how the NCAA rules and regulations put college athletes at a disadvantage in life. He spoke to Fitz about his concerns for healthcare after college athletes were done playing their sport and also for athletes being unfairly exploited. He partnered with Ramogi Huma, who played linebacker for UCLA in the late 1990s, to bring his case to the National Labor Relations Board. Using ideas that he got from the National College Players Association, which started as the Collegiate Athletes Coalition created by Huma in 1996, Colter came up with the College Athletes Players Association, which very closely resembled the National Football League Players Association and the National Basketball Association Players Association. When Huma reached out to Colter on the phone the first thing Colter told him was that he wanted to unionize Northwestern's football team. Although Colter's main concern was with longterm healthcare provisions for player, after talking with fellow athletes around the country other issues were brought to his attention such as the athlete stipend not being adequate enough to cover the total coast of attending college as an athlete, not having enough money to buy food, and not having scholarships that ensure four years of eligibility, meaning at the end of each season the head coach decides whether or not he wants to let you stay in the program and maintain your scholarship for another year. With all these things in mind Colter, partnered with Huma and Tim Waters, who headed the movement for the unionization of steelworkers, to create APU or All Players United.

The resulting explosion killed 34 people and injured 50 others, remaining one of the most deadly public transit disasters in Chicago history.  Crash  The collision occurred around 6:30pm on May 25, 1950. The accident happened at the intersection of 63rd and State Street, killing and injuring people in the two vehicles and the surrounding area. The streetcar was headed south on State Street but suddenly switched eastbound to avoid a flooded underpass. ‚ÄúApparently, the motorman of the streetcar was not paying attention, and went through that switch at total velocity, and hit the side of that truck with dire consequences,‚Äù said Craig Cleve, author of the book The Green Hornet Streetcar Disaster. The gasoline truck jackknifed after the collision and blocked State Street 200 feet north of 63rd Street. The driver of the truck, Mel Wilson, died in the cab of the truck while the conductor of the streetcar, William C. Lidell, survived.  Consequences  34 people died in the streetcar while 50 people, some on the streetcar and others in the surrounding area, were injured. According to the National Safety Council‚Äôs report two days after the crash, it was the largest death toll from a motor vehicle collision, surpassing the 29 people killed in a 1940 Texas train-truck collision. Some victims were identified immediately because of personal belongings whereas other victims were identified at the Cook County Morgue by friends and relatives in the days following the crash. In addition to the lives lost, nearby buildings and parked cars were consumed by the flames. Five buildings were completely destroyed on the east side of State Street between the 6239 and 6247 addresses. The total property damage was estimated to be around $150,000 (estimated to be $1,502,663.90 in 2016). William C. Liddell, the streetcar conductor, disappeared after the crash but was arrested the day after, charged with leaving the scene of the accident.  Aftermath  In 1955, the Chicago Transit Authority claimed it paid a total of $900,000 to families of the deceased. The accident was highly investigated, drawing conclusions as to what could prevent another such catastrophe. Among them were the addition of drainage systems for frequently flooded underpasses so operators would not have to detour, two yearly physical examinations of motormen and streetcar doors that could remain open in case of an emergency to allow for evacuation. However, in 1958 the CTA elected to stop using streetcars entirely. They were replaced by bus routes that still run today.

The home was designed and engineered by Nielsen, who began construction in 1964. Nielsen and his family resided in the home from its completion in 1966 until 1988.http://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property-Report/?propkey=65207461 Nielsen and his wife were immigrants from Denmark and the home is quintessentially representative of Mid-Century Modern architecture.http://riversideca.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&clip;_id=2587 As a representation of Mid-Century Modern Architecture, the home features ribbon windows, soffit lighting, built in units, a flat roof and multiple sputnik light fixtures. The most impressive feature of the home is the indoor swimming pool (hence the name \\"Nielsen Pool House\\"). The swimming pool room is atrium style and features expansive windows. The pool room is central to the design of the home with the bedrooms and bathrooms and living areas having direct access to the pool. The room is 2000 square feet, with the 15'x40' swimming pool located in the center. The ceiling over the pool is approximately 18' high and features retractable 10' foot sliding panels on tracks, which allow the roof to be opened to the sky. The back wall of the room consists of floor to ceiling windows and a sliding glass door which leads out to a wrap around deck and overlooks the lake on the 12th hole of the Victoria Country Club Golf course. According to Svend's son, Jack Nielsen, the enclosure of the swimming pool was not original to the home but was always a planned feature and was completed in approximately 1971. In addition to the architectural significance of the swimming pool room, the home is built onto a slope with the latter fourth of the foundation suspended by concrete pillars 20 feet above grade. The slope itself was tiered at the time of construction, featuring trees and plants that offered over 50 varieties of fruit and vegetables, including citrus and avocado, however, much of this was allowed to die due to lack of adequate irrigation. The living area of the home is essentially one story with an additional bedroom and three car garage as a walkout basement underneath the home built out from the slope. The interior of the home is listed on county records as 2,880 square feet, however, taped measurements come in at 3,342 square feet. The home features a large living room, family room, dining room, 6 bedrooms (including the walkout bedroom adjacent the garage) and four bathrooms. The area of the swimming pool room is not included in the home's living area. Nielsen Pool House - Front Svend Nielsen sold the home in 1988, whereupon it changed hands several times until being acquired in 1995. The home was in poor condition at this time and expansive renovations were done in 1980's-1990's style, including new windows, stucco, and interior finishes such as white and green ceramic tile. In 2015, the home was purchased by the Cloake family, who remodeled the home in a style consistent with its Mid Century Modern heritage. Renovations included new paint, landscape and interior finishes, including wood floors and natural slate. In some cases, the original home finishes were able to be salvaged, such as the original VAT in the dining room and original subway tile in all the restrooms (tile had been left under newer tile installed in 1995). As a result of their renovation efforts, the Cloake's were awarded a Renovation Award by the Old Riverside Foundation in 2016. The home was the first mid- century modern home to receive an award in the history of the old Riverside Foundation. On September 13, 2016, the Riverside City council voted unanimously to name the home a Riverside City Landmark (#134); The Nielsen Pool House due to its significance in being designed and built by Svend Nielsen as well as its representation of Mid Century Modern architecture.http://riversideca.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&clip;_id=2587 frameless 504x504px Swimming Pool Room Living Room References  * Category:Houses in Riverside County, California Category:Modernist architecture in California ","title":"Nielsen Pool House"},{"id":"51805945","text":"Susy Vaterlaus (born 26 July 1932) is a Swiss former swimmer.

Acknowledgment: Davide De Martin) DS Crucis is one of the brightest stars in the region of the NGC 4775 open cluster, better known as the Jewel Box Cluster, but its membership of the cluster is in doubt. The cluster is part of the larger Centaurus OB1 association and lies about 8,500 light years away. DS Crucis and NGC 4755 lie just to the south-east of Œ≤ Crucis, the lefthand star of the famous Southern Cross. Variability DS Crucis is a variable star with an amplitude of about 0.05 magnitudes. It was found to be variable from the photometry performed by the Hipparcos satellite. The variability type is unclear but it is assumed to be an Œ± Cygni variable. Properties DS Crucis is an A1 bright supergiant (luminosity class Ia), although it has also been classified as A2 Iabe. It is nearly 80,000 times the luminosity of the sun, partly due to its higher temperature of 9,000 K, and partly to being over a hundred times larger than the sun.

This list of birds of Tennessee includes species documented in the U.S. state of Tennessee and accepted by the Tennessee Bird Records Committee (TBRC) of the Tennessee Ornithological Society. As of February 2020, 423 species were on the official list. Of them, 41 are considered accidental, 30 are considered casual, and 13 are labeled provisional as defined below. Five species were introduced to North America, two are extinct, and three have been extirpated. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them.

The principles used for CO sensors (and other types of gas) are infrared gas sensors and chemical gas sensors. Carbon monoxide sensors are used to assess the CO amount during an Ministry of Transport test.http://www.cryptontechnology.com/files/290_295%20gas%20analysers%20manual.pdf In order to be used for such test it must be a pproved as suitable for use in the scheme. In the UK, a list of acceptable exhaust gas analysers for use within the MOT test is available via the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency website. Lambda coefficient measurement The presence of oxygen in the exhaust gases indicates that the combustion of the mixture was not perfect, resulting in contaminant gases. Thus measuring the proportion of oxygen in the exhaust gases of these engines can monitor and measure these emissions. This measurement is performed in the MOT test through Lambda coefficient measurement. The Lambda coefficient (Œª) is obtained from the relationship between air and gasoline involved in combustion of the mixture. It is a measure of the efficiency of the gasoline engine by measuring the percentage of oxygen in the exhaust. When gasoline engines operate with a stoichiometric mixture of 14.7: 1 the value of lambda (Œª) is \\"1\\". Mixing ratio = weight of fuel / weight of air :- Expressed as mass ratio: 14.7 kg of air per 1 kg. of fuel. :- Expressed as volume ratio: 10,000 liters of air per 1 liter of fuel. With this relationship theoretically a complete combustion of gasoline is achieved and greenhouse gas emissions would be minimal. The coefficient is defined as Lambda coefficient If Lambda > 1 = lean mixture, excess of air. If Lambda < 1 = rich mixture, excess of gasoline. *A lean mixture contains an excess of oxygen. The surplus oxygen will react with nitrogen to (oxides of nitrogen), if the temperature is high enough (around 1600¬∞C) for enough time to permit so. *A rich mixture contains a deficit of oxygen. This makes it impossible for all fuel to combust completely to carbon dioxide and water vapour. Hence, some fuel will remain as a hydrocarbon, or it will react only to carbon monoxide (CO). The carbon monoxide concentration in exhaust gases is closely related, and almost proportional to the air fuel ratio in the rich regions. It is, therefore, of great value when tuning an engine. *Carbon dioxide emitted is theoretically directly proportional to the fuel consumed at a given and constant air fuel ratio. Less carbon dioxide will be emitted per litre of fuel if Œª < 1, since some fuel won't be able to combust completely.  Types of sensors  =Chemical CO sensors= *Chemical CO gas sensors with sensitive layers based on polymer- or heteropolysiloxane have the principal advantage of a very low energy consumption, and can be reduced in size to fit into microelectronic-based systems. On the downside, short- and long term drift effects as well as a rather low overall lifetime are major obstacles when compared with the nondispersive infrared sensor measurement principle.Reliable CO Sensors Based with Silicon-based Polymers on Quartz Microbalance Transducers, R.

The key components are an infrared source, a light tube, an interference (wavelength) filter, and an infrared detector. The gas is pumped or diffuses into the light tube, and the electronics measures the absorption of the characteristic wavelength of light. Sensors are most often used for measuring carbon monoxide.Carbonate Based CO Sensors with High Performance, Th. Lang, H.-D. Wiemh√∂fer and W. G√∂pel, Conf.Proc.Eurosensors IX, Stockholm (S) (1995); Sensors and Actuators B, 34, 1996, 383‚Äì387. The best of these have sensitivities of 20‚Äì50 PPM. Most CO sensors are fully calibrated prior to shipping from the factory. Over time, the zero point of the sensor needs to be calibrated to maintain the long term stability of the sensor.

Typical sensors cost in the (US) $100 to $1000 range.

History Michael Davitt, circa. 1878 The school, which opened in 1984 would previously be known as 'the tech', would later be named Davitt College by then-principal Joe Langan because ‚Äúhe [Langan] did not like the term ‚Äòtech‚Äô with its derogatory connotations‚Äù. He had also introduced the school uniform, the first in any vocational school in Ireland as he stated 'was an indication of things to come.' Joe Langan died in July 2006 and in 2011 Davitt College named their new sports hall after him. The school is named after Michael Davitt, an Irish republican and agrarian campaigner who founded the Irish National Land League. He was also a labour leader, Home Rule politician and Member of Parliament (MP). He campaigned for Home Rule and was a close ally of Charles Stuart Parnell, the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, until the party split over Parnell's divorce and Davitt joined the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation. The school was run under authority by the VEC until July 2013 when it was replaced by the ETB. A student who attended Davitt College named Shane Gavin never missed a single day of school in a space of 13 years since he started primary school.

He emigrated to the United States early in his life, and before joining the Society of Jesuits was committed to volunteer work. Moylan, as a secular priest, worked with the Native Americans and fishermen on the Gasp√© Peninsula. When he was twenty- nine, on November 14, 1851 he joined the Society of Jesuits. After joining the Society, he was assigned to teach a course at Fordham University. After several other positions, including at St. Francis Xavier's, Moylan became the ninth president of Fordham in 1865.  St. John's College--Fordham University  Moylan made several additions to the college that helped advance it into the late-nineteenth-century world. \\"Some examples of these changes include napkins on the tables (1867), hot buns for the boarder in the afternoon (1868).\\" Alongside these changes, Moylan also decided to continue the goal of his predecessor, Edward Doucet; he wanted to expand Fordham's campus through the addition of a new building. He wrote a letter to the Department of Education in Albany describing the advantages of the new building for the taxpayers, began a novena, and raised the tuition. While the tuition increase did provide Moylan with some of the funds he desired, Albany rejected his proposal. He modified his goal, and decided to start with the building of a new wing.  Legacy  The new wing, Seniors' Hall, was finished in 1867. It was \\"a five-story building located to the east of the Administration Building for the college students that eventually contained dormitories, classrooms, study halls, reading rooms, a billiard room, and a gym complete with battling- net for baseball practice during the winter.\\" While Moylan's dream for the college was not completed, the Seniors' Hall forms a part of the large Dealy building currently a part of the Rose Hill campus.

Of eight crew members on board, only one survived. On 20 September 2001 the Polish Maritime Court (Izba Morska) ruled the disaster was caused in 70% by SY Bieszczady and in 30% by MV Lady Elena. The court explained SY Bieszczady was holding radar reflector which did not meet maritime safety standards and was not showing port and starboard lights. Nevertheless, the court stated MV Lady Elena did not notice Bieszczadys stern light about 10 minutes before the accident, although it should have done it. In the result of the collision seven sailors died. In June 2002 the Polish Appellate Maritime Court (Odwo≈Çawcza Izba Morska) set aside the judgement of September 2001 and sent case to be heard again.

History The term marketing engineering can be traced back to Lilien et al. in \\"The Age of Marketing Engineering\\" published in 1998; in this article the authors define marketing engineering as the use of computer decision models for making marketing decisions. Marketing managers typically use \\"conceptual marketing\\", that is they develop a mental model of the decision situation based on past experience, intuition and reasoning. That approach has its limitations though: experience is unique to every individual, there is no objective way of choosing between the best judgments of multiple individuals in such a situation and furthermore judgment can be influenced by the person position in the firm's hierarchy. In the same year Lilien G. L. and A. Rangaswamy published Marketing Engineering: Computer-Assisted Marketing Analysis and Planning, Fildes and VenturaThe Journal of Operational Research Society, Vol. 51, No. 7 (Jul., 2000), pp. 891‚Äì892 praised the book in their review, while noting that a fuller discussion of market share models and econometric models would have made the book better for teaching and that \\"conceptual marketing\\" should not be discarded in the presence of marketing engineering, but that both approaches should be used together. Leeflang and Wittink (2000)P.S.H. Leeflang, D. R. Wittink, Building models for marketing decisions: Past, present and future, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 2000 have identified five era of model building in marketing: # (1950-1965) The first era of application of operations research and management science to marketing # (1965-1970) Adaptation of models to fit marketing problems # (1970-1985) Emphasis on models that are an acceptable representation of reality and are easy to use # (1985-2000) Increase interest in marketing decision support systems, meta-analyses and studies of the generalizability of results # (2000- . ) Growth of new exchange systems (ex: e-commerce) and need for new modeling approaches How to build market models and how to develop a structured approach to marketing questions has been an issue of active discussion between researchers, L. Lilien and A. Rangaswamy (2001) have observed that while having data gives a competitive advantage, having too much data without the models and systems for working with it may turn out to be as bad as not having the data. Lodish (2001) Leonard M. Lodish, (2001) Building Marketing Models that Make Money. Interfaces 31(3_supplement):S45-S5 observed that the most complicated and elegant model will not necessarily be the one adopted in the firm, good models are the ones who capture the trade-offs of decision making, subjective estimates may be necessary to complete the model, risk needs to be taken into account, model complexity must be balanced versus ease of understanding, models should integrate tactical with strategic aspects. Migley (2002)David Migley, What to codify: marketing science or marketing engineering? Marketing theory 2002 identifies four purposes in codifying marketing knowledge: # To facilitate the progress of marketing as a science # To promote the discipline within its institutional and professional environments # To better educate and credential the potential manager # To provide competitive advantage to the firm Lilien et al.(2002)Lilien L.G., Rangaswamy A., van Bruggen Gerrit H.,Wierenga B., Bridging the marketing theory-practice gap with marketing engineering, Journal of Business Research 2002 define marketing engineering as \\"the systematic process of putting marketing data and knowledge to practical use through the planning, design, and construction of decision aids and marketing management support systems (MMSSs)\\". One the driving factors toward the development of marketing engineering are the use of high-powered personal computers connected to LANs and WANs, the exponential growth in the volume of data, the reengineering of marketing functions.

Ashton was a founder member of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, and was elected as its president in 1878. He also served as treasurer of the United Textile Factory Workers' Association, and secretary of the Oldham Trades and Labour Council. Ashton also took an interest in politics, and was twice selected as the Labour Party candidate for Oldham.

He emigrated to the United States as a glass engraver from London.Two sources cited, Merchants and Encyclopaedia Judaica list conflicting dates, 1793 and 1796 for Moss' arrival into America. Moss soon turned to other ventures after glass engraving proved insufficient to sustain a decent wage. He opened a dry goods store in 1807 and soon became a major importer, eventually owning a small merchant fleet. In 1823, he turned control of the business to his brothers and turned his attention to various civic enterprises. He was a founding member of the Musical Fund Society. He served as a steward of the Society of Sons of St. George a mutual-aid society for former Englishmen like himself and was a benefactor of the Philadelphia Orphan Asylum. In 1825, he acted as judge of engraved glass during the Franklin Institute's second exposition of American craftsmanship. .In 1828 he entered into politics by being elected to the Philadelphia City Council's lower house, the Common Council, on the Jacksonian Democratic Party ticket. It was in this capacity that he played a role in the establishment of the Wills Eye Hospital. Later in life he became a supporter of Isaac Leeser's American Jewish Publication Society. In 1840, in the wake of the Damascus Affair Moss led a protest committee from the city of Philadelphia.  Personal life  In his personal life, John Moss was an active member of the synagogue Congregation Mikveh Israel, and contributed heavily to its building fund of 1818. He married Rebecca Lyons on February 15, 1797. He had nine children with her. John Moss died at age 76 on April 5, 1847 and was buried in Mikveh Israel Cemetery in Philadelphia.  Lucien Moss  Of note amongst the descendants of John Moss is his grandson Lucien Moss. Lucien Moss was born in Philadelphia on May 25, 1831 and was educated in New Haven, Conn and in Philadelphia, PA. As a machinist for the Philadelphia based firm of Morris & Tawes, he supervised the construction of sugar mills in Puerto Rico. In 1878, he founded the firm of Wiler & Moss, a brass working company. After this, he retired to Philadelphia, and much like his grandfather, engaged in charitable work. He was member of the boards of both the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. After his death on April 19, 1895, he left his fortune to the Jewish Hospital Association of Philadelphia to found the Lucien Moss Home for Incurables of the Jewish Faith, which would later be known as MossRehab in the modern day.

The marina has been in operation since 1991 and is situated adjacent to Tangkrogen on the south side of the Port of Aarhus, It includes restaurants, cafes, a hotel and a number of sports clubs and sailing schools.  History  The background for the yacht harbor was the expansion of the Port of Aarhus in 1981‚Äì83. The construction of the new port facilities required storing a large amount of dirt which created a lagoon by Tangkrogen. Boat owners who was waiting for a spot at one of the marinas in Arhus, or who couldn't afford one, started storing their boats and ships in the lagoon. Eventually space became sparse and construction had reached a point where the lagoon would have to abandoned. Seeking the establishment of a real harbor, local sailors formed the organization Marselisborg Havneforening on 26 May 1982. The initial board consisted of 4 members elected by members of the organization with a fifth being appointed by Aarhus Municipality. The new organization contacted the city council and started negotiations. On 24 Nov 1982 the Aarhus city council voted to stop filling in the lagoon and establish a committee to establish a new yacht harbor. AFter lengthy discussions with al involved parties, on 30 April 1984 Marselisborg Havneforening presented their final proposal to the city council. the harbor was to be financed partly by selling spots at the berths. On 19 June 1985 the city council sent the proposal to the final public hearing and on 20 November 1985 a construction company began removing construction debris and excess earth. Almost 6 years later in June 1991, Marselisborg Yacht Harbour was inaugurated.  Ownership  Marselisborg Yacht Harbour is owned and operated by the self-owning foundation Fonden Marselisborg Havn. The foundation was established by Aarhus Municipality in 1987 for the purpose of operating the marina. The initial budget was 700.000 DKK with the rest to be covered by future operating income. The board consists of 5-7 members of which one is selected by Aarhus Municipality and the rest are elected by the place-owners in the harbor.

The satellite will provide high definition and ultra-high-definition television, very-small-aperture terminal (VSAT) communications, satellite news gathering relays, and other communications services, primarily to the Balkan Peninsula and Central/Western Europe.  Spacecraft  BulgariaSat-1 is based on an intermediate-power variant of the SSL 1300 satellite bus with a 15+ year design life. Coupled with the boost provided by its Falcon 9 launch vehicle, it carries enough fuel for more than 18 years of service. Power is supplied by two three-panel solar arrays delivering 10 kilowatts, while propulsion is provided by an R-4D-11 hypergolic rocket engine supplemented by an array of attitude control thrusters. The spacecraft is equipped with 30 Ku-band broadcasting-satellite service (BSS) transponders and 3 Ku-band fixed-satellite service (FSS) transponders. It will be parked in geostationary orbit at 1.9¬∞ East. BulgariaSat-1 is the first Bulgarian satellite to operate in geostationary orbit, and is the nation's second spacecraft after Bulgaria 1300 in 1981.  History  SSL (formerly Space Systems/Loral) was announced in September 2014 to be the selected manufacturer of BulgariaSat-1. In addition, the company has partnered with Bulgaria Sat to secure financing, insurance, and the Falcon 9 launch vehicle. The Export‚ÄìImport Bank of the United States has provided in export credit financing to Bulgaria Sat. The CEO of Bulgaria Sat, Maxim Zayakov, stated that the total cost of the BulgariaSat-1 project was . At the time of SSL's contract award, BulgariaSat-1 was scheduled to launch by the end of 2016. Delays within SpaceX, including the loss of two Falcon 9 rockets, pushed the launch back to 15 June 2017; additional delays resulting from pressure within SpaceX's launch schedule and the need to replace a valve in the Falcon 9 launch fairing pushed the launch to 23 June. SpaceX launched BulgariaSat-1 on 23 June 2017 from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A. The Falcon 9 first stage B1029 used to launch the spacecraft was previously flown for an Iridium NEXT mission in January 2017, only the second time that SpaceX had reflown a booster. This booster successfully landed on the SpaceX drone ship Of Course I Still Love You after completing its BulgariaSat-1 flight. In mid-July 2017, Bulgaria Sat stated that during its intensive preparations for commercial operations on the satellite, all systems of BulgariaSat-1 were functioning normally. By the time of launch, the satellite had been targeted to be operational in early August 2017 but this was pushed back to later in the year. Bulgaria Sat will use Ericsson equipment for the distribution of ultra- high-definition television to the Balkans region.  Bulgaria Sat  Bulgaria Sat, headquartered in Sofia, Bulgaria, is the country's only owner of its own satellite. The company provides satellite communications to broadcast, telecom, corporate and government customers. Bulgaria Sat is an affiliate of Bulsatcom, the largest provider of pay-TV services in Bulgaria.

Notable works include the development of Reaction Progress Kinetic Analysis (RPKA), analysis of non-linear effects of catalyst enantiopurity, biological homochirality and amino acid behavior. She was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2013. In 2020 she was elected to the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.  Biography  Blackmond was born on April 19, 1958 in Pittsburgh, PA, where she attended University of Pittsburgh and received her undergraduate and master's degree in Chemical Engineering. She received the Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1984. She became a professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh shortly after graduating and was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 1989. Blackmond remained in academia for 8 years before moving on to the Associate Director position at Merck & Co., Inc. Her main responsibility at the company was to set up a laboratory for research and development in the kinetics and catalysis of organic reactions. Blackmond is now a Professor of Chemistry at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. Her most current research applies the quantitative aspects of her chemical engineering background to the synthesis of complex organic molecules by catalytic routes, particularly asymmetric catalysis. She has one son, Daniel \\"Danny\\" Trevor Blackmond Bradley, who is a musician, comedian, actor and postman.  Areas of research  = Reaction Progress Kinetic Analysis = Blackmond has pioneered the methodology of Reaction Progress Kinetic Analysis (RPKA), which is used for rapid determination of concentration dependences of reactants. RPKA allows for in situ measurements to produce a number of rate equations that enable analysis of a reaction using a minimal number of experiments. The purpose for this type of analysis is to help understand what the driving force of a reaction might be and describe possible mechanistic pathways. This technique distinguishes rate processes occurring on the catalytic cycle from those occurring off the cycle. Notable applications of RPKA include asymmetric hydrogenation, asymmetric organocatalytic reactions, palladium catalyzed carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bond forming reactions, and transition-metal catalyzed competitive reactions. = Nonlinear effects of catalyst enantiopurity = Nonlinear effects describe the non-ideal relationship between enantiomeric excess (ee) of products of a reaction and the ee of the catalyst, a phenomenon first observed by Henri Kagan. Kagan developed mathematical models to describe this non-ideal behavior, MLn models. Blackmond has performed studies that have led to an understanding of reaction rate and its relationship to catalyst ee. Many proposed mathematical models have been tested in the Blackmond lab, which have helped determine possible mechanistic features of reactions, including the Soai reaction. The Soai reaction is of abiotic synthetic interest because it is an autocatalytic reaction, which rapidly produces a large amount of enantiopure products. Blackmond was the first to use Kagan's ML2 model to study the non-linear effects of this reaction. She was the first to conclude that a homochiral dimer was the active catalyst in promoting homochirality for the Soai reaction. = Biological homochirality and amino acid phase behavior = More recently, Blackmond has extended kinetic models to describe the origin of biological homochirality. She has shown solutions of mostly enantiopure amino acids can be produced from nearly racemic mixtures via solution-solid partitioning of the enantiomers. The discovery that eutectic mixtures could be manipulated, depending on the components of the mixture, allows for changes to the crystal structure and solubility of substances. Amino acids can solidify in two ways, as a mixture of D and L enantiomers or as a single enantiomers. Partitioning of molecules occurs between the liquid and solid phases, such that enantiopure amino acids will get \\"stuck\\" in either phase.

Biography Mar√≠a Josefa de la Sant√≠sima Trinidad Collado Romero was born in central Cimmarones (now the municipality Carlos Rojas) in Matanzas Province, which was formerly part of La Habana Province. She was part of an upper-class family. Early publications She began her career in journalism in 1913, though she encountered difficulties due to the machismo which was prevalent at the time. She published her first articles about women's rights in the magazine Protectora de la Mujer. In 1920 she was named publicity director of the Women's Club. In 1924, the president of the National Suffragist Party, Amalia Mall√©n, named Collado her vice president. Later, due to differences around the party's position with respect to President Gerardo Machado, Collado left to form her own Democratic Suffragist Party, of which she was the first president. Later she was editor of the women's page of the journal La Discusi√≥n. She also worked at La Noche as parliamentary reporter and reporter in the Presidential Palace. She contributed to the newspapers Heraldo Liberal and La Tarde, and to the magazine Bohemia. She wrote articles for El Diario de la Marina and for the journal Diez de Octubre, an organ of the Merchants' Association of the municipality Diez de Octubre. She worked at the RHC-Cadena Azul News and at 1010 News. She founded the newscast CMBY. In 1932 Collado founded and edited the magazine La Mujer, which was active until 1942. This made it the longest- running feminist publication of pre-Revolutionary Cuba. She contributed to various journals and magazines in Havana. She was twice awarded the Enrique Jos√© Varona prize, and also received √Ålvaro Reynoso and V√≠ctor Mu√±oz prizes. She worked on the newscasts Radio Continental, Patria Nueva (1917-1918), Cuba Nueva, and La Lucha, under the pseudonyms Orqu√≠dea, Margarita del Campo, and Margarita Silvestre. For much of her life Collado lived in Diez de Octubre, on Lacret Street between the streets San Francisco and Centuri√≥n. At her behest, the Grau government renamed Chaple Street for General Lacret, in honor of that distinguished mamb√≠. A monument to him was also erected on Lacret and V√≠a Blanca. Feminism Collado was known as a tenacious feminist. In the magazine Protectora de Mujeres she advocated the creation of laws for the protection of women, with numerous articles published in the national press and abroad. She fought vigorously for the equality of women, defending their right to vote. She participated actively in the Women's Club of Cuba. She worked hard in favor of rural working women. In 1922 she initiated the creation of the Women's Agricultural School, which later became the Rosal√≠a Abreu school. She fought for women's right to work in commerce. To this end she became a voluntary inspector, and was later the first person to be designated an official trade inspector. The conflict between Mar√≠a Collado (leader of the suffragists) and Pilar Morlon (leader of the feminists) was used by the conservative press to argue that women were still not ready to become citizens and vote. Parliamentary reporter Mar√≠a Collado worked as a parliamentary reporter for various radio stations and print media for the better part of the Republic's neocolonial period. In 1940, under the government of dictator Fulgencio Batista, Collado was banned from the group of reporters covering news at the Presidential Palace. Between 1944 and 1948, during the presidency of Ram√≥n Grau, the press spokesman at the Presidential Palace denied her accreditation. In her complaint she explained that the discrimination was due to \\"my being a woman, and perhaps a decent woman.\\" On another occasion, the Minister of Public Works invited reporters to visit specific sites in his sector, but when Mar√≠a Collado was about to take the vehicle to leave the ministry, he blocked her, saying, \\"This trip is not for women.\\" Once, an invitation was extended to journalists to cover a lunch session of the Senate, but Collado was excluded. The next day she asked for an explanation and the journalist Cab√∫s, director of Diario de Sesiones del Senado, told her that it had been a relaxing party which women could not attend, and that she should realize that women in journalism got in the way and were a disaster. She supported the Law of the Chair (), which forced businesses to let women sit. She also presented a request for businesses to close at noon for employees to have lunch. She advised many women starting in journalism before the creation of the Manuel M√°rquez Sterling school. Her magazine La Mujer (Havana) helped to prepare many young female journalists of the 1930s. Collado won the Varona and V√≠ctor Mu√±oz journalism prizes. At the end of the Cuban Revolution, Mar√≠a Collado had retired from journalism, but she still joined the ranks of the Federation of Cuban Women (; FMC), founded in 1960 as part of the Communist Party of Cuba, where she witnessed the full incorporation of women into society which she had struggled for all her life. Death She died as a resident of the municipality Diez de Octubre in the second half of the 1960s.

In Mage Wars Arena players take the role of powerful and experienced mages fighting in a gladiator style arena duel. Despite being a card game, Mage Wars Arena has several significant mechanics in common with tactical miniatures games, such as movement and range, as well as having a game length more typical of tactical miniatures games.  Gameplay / Playing Mage Wars Arena  The game starts with each player controlling a mage who has a book full of spells. The object of the game is to increase the enemy mage's damage until it is equal to or greater than their life. The game is divided into rounds, and each round is divided into two stages: the Ready Stage and the Action Stage. The ready stage is the \\"bookkeeping\\" stage, and includes phases for things like gaining mana and planning your spells for the round. Players can only plan two spells from their spellbook to be able to cast each round. During the Action Stage, players take turns using creatures (such as their mage) to do an action. There are many things that actions can be used for, such as moving, attacking, guarding, or casting a spell. In addition to their normal action, mages have a special action called a quickcast action, which they can use only for casting certain kinds of spells. The quickcast action can be used directly before or after a creature's action, or in a quickcast phase, which occurs at the beginning and end of the action stage.  Spells  All cards in the game are spells until they have resolved. All spells have a mana cost and an action cost. Mana is the magical energy used to cast spells. Mages gain mana equal to their channeling stat every round. An action is what a creature does during its \\"turn\\" during the action stage. There are two types of actions: quick and full. A creature can move before using a quick action, but they cannot move before using a full action. Spells can either cost a full action or a quick action in addition to their mana cost. Spells also have a spell point cost that must be paid before the game in order to include them in your spellbook. Every Mage in Mage Wars Arena has 120 points to spend on spellboook construction before play. There are six types of spells: Creature, Conjuration, Enchantment, Equipment, Attack and Incantation. Creatures are beings that can use actions, conjurations are constructs and (usually) inanimate forms, enchantments are cast face down and can be \\"revealed\\" by flipping them face up later for delayed effects which can surprise the opponent. Equipments are things like weapons and armor and clothing which a mage can wear. Attack spells are spells which trigger a particular ranged attack, and incantations provide a variety of temporary magical effects. Both attack spells and incantations are discarded after use.  Mage Wars Core Game Components  = Game Board = The arena is a grid of 12 squares, with each mage starting in opposite corners. These squares are used gauge distance between objects, and to determine the range of various actions. Range is measured orthogonally(horizontally and vertically) and never diagonally. Vision between objects can be blocked by walls. = Spellbook = Each Mage must have a spellbook, which is a card binder that holds all the spell cards they can cast during the game. The Mage Wars Arena core set comes with two spellbook binders. Additional spellbook binders can be purchased for games involving more than two players and many expansions come with two spellbook binders. However, the binders are not strictly necessary to play the game. = Mage Status Board = Each player uses a Mage Status Board to keep track of his mage‚Äôs current Channeling, Damage, Life, and Mana. = Dice =  Attack Dice  Attack dice are rolled during an attack to see how much damage is scored. They are also used to roll for various effects such as healing. Each die has the sides (0,0,1,1*,2,2*) where * sides have a white starburst which signifies armour-ignoring critical damage.  12-Sided Die  The 12-sided die (1d12) is used to check for special game effects, such as: *Certain attacks require a 1d12 roll to determine if a special effect or condition occurs (such as stun, daze, etc.); *When a creature tries to avoid an attack with a defense, it rolls the d12 to see if it is successful; *Some conditions require a 1d12 roll to see if it can be removed or escaped; *Any random movement or direction is determined by the roll of 1d12 and the compass rose printed on the game board. = Markers =  Action Markers  Each player gets a set of action markers. Action markers are colored on one side, and white on the other. The colored side is different for each player. The core set comes with only two colors of action markers. Each creature in the game receives an action marker. Action markers are used to record when a creature takes an action each turn. The different colors are used to show which player controls each creature. At the start of each game turn, all action markers start face up (colored side up), showing that the creatures are ready to act. After a creature acts, the action marker is turned face down (white side up) to show they are finished for the turn.  Quick Spell Action Marker  As a powerful spell-caster, Mages can cast a quick spell each turn, in addition to his normal actions. The Quick Spell Action Marker is used to show whether a Mage has cast his Quick Spell or not each turn. It is used the same way as the regular Action Markers.  Damage Markers  Damage Markers are used to record damage on creatures and objects. When an object or creature receives damage equal to or greater than its life it is destroyed (removed from the game board and placed in the discard pile).  Mana Markers  Some objects in the game, such as a conjuration spawnpoint can actually channel and store their own mana. Mana markers are used to record how much mana these objects have stored.  Guard Markers  Guard markers are placed on creatures that are ‚Äïguarding.‚Äñ Guarding allows a creature to protect its zone from intruders.  Ready Markers  A Ready Marker is placed on a creature if it has a defense. A defense is an ability to avoid an attack, such as using a shield to block or dodging. Most defenses can only be used once per game turn‚Äîthe Ready Marker is flipped over when the defense has been used for the turn. In addition to defenses, some objects in the game may call for a ready marker to keep track of whether it has been used during a turn. All ready markers are flipped over to the ready side during the reset markers phase.  Condition Markers  These markers represent various conditions creatures and objects can receive. For example, if a creature is stunned by a lightning bolt, a stun marker is placed on the creature. If a creature becomes corroded by acid, place one or more corrode condition markers on the creature.  Initiative Marker  The initiative marker is used to keep track of which player has the initiative that turn. The player with the initiative gets to acts first during the action stage of the game turn (see game turn below). Each turn the initiative marker is passed to the next player clockwise. = Reference Sheets = The Reference Sheet shows a detailed turn order guide and valuable information to refer to during the game. = Glossary = An in-depth alphabetical glossary is included which describes all the traits, conditions, and other game terms. = Sideboard = The Mage Wars base set comes with a variety of additional spells you can use to customize each of the included Mages. A complete list of spells is enclosed in each sideboard so that you can reassemble the spellbooks to their original state at any time.  Mages  In the core set, the following Mages are available to play: * Beastmaster of Straywood * Priestess of Asyra * Warlock of the Arraxian Crown * Wizard of Sortilege In order of publication, the expansions introduced: * Forcemaster versus Warlord * Conquest of Kumanjaro (alternate Beastmaster and alternate Priest) * Druid versus Necromancer * Forged in Fire (alternate Warlock and alternate Warlord) *Paladin versus Siren  Schools of Magic in the Realm of Mage Wars  Spells belong to various schools of magic. There are 10 Schools of Magic in total: 6 major and 4 minor elemental schools. Each school is based on a different variety or type of magic, with a unique flavour and feel. The 6 major schools are: *Holy *Nature *Dark *Mind *Arcane *War The 4 minor schools of elemental magic are: *Fire *Earth *Air *Water  The Realm of Mage Wars  Expansions =Core Spell Tome= The Core Spell Tome Expansion features the most important spells of the original game. If there are not as many copies as a player is allowed to have in his spellbook, or another player wants to have access to the same cards, this expansion provides additional cards. =Core Spell Tome 2= The Core Spell Tome 2 expansion contains 110 cards that feature additional copies of the more powerful spells in the Mage Wars base game, including higher level spells and legendary creatures. Of the 110 cards, more than seventy spells are not found in the first Core Spell Tome. =Mage Wars: Forcemaster vs. Warlord= This was the first two-mage expansion set for Mage Wars, focusing on two schools of magic not emphasized in the core set: the Mind School and the War School. It introduces two brand new mages to the game, the Forcemaster and the Warlord. =Mage Wars: Conquest of Kumanjaro= This new expansion features a modified Beastmaster (Female), and a Priest (Male Priestess). This pack is unique because it has a backstory. The Johktari Beastmastress is trying to protect her jungle from the invading nation of Westlock. The expansion includes cards to enhance all the mages, but primarily builds the nature and holy schools. =Mage Wars: Druid vs. Necromancer= This expansion features two new mages, the Druid trained in the Nature and Water School and the Necromancer trained in the Dark School. This set also features 216 spell cards along with 2 Mage spellbooks tailored to both Mages. =Mage Wars: Forged in Fire= This expansion features a modified Warlock (Female) and a modified Warlord (Dwarf). Like Conquest of Kumanjaro, this is a smaller \\"spell tome\\" expansion adding new cards and special abilities for these existing mage types, and filling out the war, earth, dark and fire schools. The new Warlord's recommended spell book requires some cards from the Forcemaster vs. Warlord expansion. =Mage Wars: Paladin vs Siren= This expansion features two new mages, the Siren trained in the Mind and Water School and the Paladin trained in the Holy and War School. This set also features 216 spell cards along with 2 Mage spellbooks tailored to both Mages.  Artwork  Cover artwork was created by Craig J. Spearing.

In some ways, that's a shame: The second season had a tight arc that both deployed some fantastic storytelling and demonstrated the show's myriad abilities.

Penske Media Corporation: Los Angeles, July 21, 2016. Liz Shannon Miller of Indiewire gave the season an \\"A\\", saying: \\"Many Season 3 episodes are definable in simple terms [...] they actually function as stand-alone on a level that you honestly don't see too often...this leads to some jaw-dropping installments, which iris in on character on levels that range from hilarious to heartbreaking.\\"Liz Shannon Miller. \\"Review: 'BoJack Horseman' Season 3, Episode by Episode, Stays Beautiful‚ÄîBut Never Apologizes For Going Dark\\" Indiewire. Penske Media Corporation: Los Angeles, July 13, 2016. The fourth episode, \\"Fish Out of Water,\\" received critical acclaim and has largely been considered the highlight of the season. Bojack's production designer Lisa Hanawalt talked about the episode in an interview with Vox, stating: \\"I'm so delighted with what we were able to do [...] everyone [on the show] knew it was our Fantasia.Caroline Framke. \\"How BoJack Horseman's gorgeous underwater episode came together, explained by the show's creative team.\\" Vox. Vox Media: Washington, D.C., August 1, 2016.

Time, Inc.: New York, November 22, 2016. Jesse David Fox of Vulture.com also called this episode one of the best of 2016, saying the episode \\"plays out as if the iconic Looney Tunes director Chuck Jones were tasked with doing a Charlie Chaplin‚Äìinspired Fantasia segment [...] tonally and formally inventive, silly and bittersweet, visually and sonically beautiful: It's a much-watch, and the best part is, you don't have to have watched a single other episode of the series to love it.\\"Jesse David Fox. \\"This BoJack Horseman Episode Is a Must-Watch, Even If You've Never Seen the Show.\\" Vulture. New York Media: New York, July 22, 2016. Les Chappell of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A\\", stating: \\"This episode is nothing short of a masterpiece, a culmination of both BoJack Horseman's unique animation style and its views on isolation and connection. Taken as part of the whole it could very well be the best episode that the show has ever done, and taken on its own it's a hauntingly beautiful story of being a stranger in a strange land. It finds the lowest possible geographic point to take its main character, and from that place it ascends to the highest point the series has ever reached.\\"Les Chappell. \\"BoJack Horseman goes underwater and hits its high-water mark in a tour de force episode.\\" The A.V. Club. Onion, Inc.: Chicago, July 28, 2016. This season's look at depression was also praised. Show creator Raphael Bob- Waksberg, in an interview with HuffPost, explained that for the series, \\"It was never our top priority to be the voice of depression [...] [Bojack Horseman is not] trying to capture this thing [depression] as much as it is trying to capture this character and what he is.\\"Maxwell Strachan. \\"'Bojack Horseman' Didn't Want To Be 'The Voice of Depression'.\\" HuffPost. Verizon Communications: New York, July 23, 2016. Regardless, Maxwell Strachan of HuffPost considers this season, and the show as a whole, to be one of the very few shows that accurately depicts the mental illness, saying \\"Outside of a handful of series, depictions of depression in Hollywood have historically felt one-dimensional, as if writers Googled 'depression' and decided it meant 'sad.' In BoJack, we finally have a fully formed character that deals with depression in all its forms, too. We see BoJack suffocating as he grapples with the idea that he will never reach his own definition of greatness, that it is too late to turn his life around, that his best days are behind him and his worst ones ahead. It's not pretty, but it can be soothing to see someone who relates, even if that someone is a drunk horse with a temper.\\" Strachan further explains: \\"For a brief moment, it feels as if BoJack has finally had a revelation that could last‚Äïthat he will stop his self-destructive ways, learn to prioritize the people he cares about and beat his depression forever. But soon enough, BoJack is back in the pit of despair, hating himself and hurting the people around him. It's a sad, familiar cycle. It's also what makes the show so good. 'BoJack Horseman' doesn't excuse bad behavior. But it certainly can help those who are struggling with the depression that can cause that bad behavior to feel less alone.\\" References Category:2016 American television seasons Category:BoJack Horseman seasons ","title":"BoJack Horseman (season 3)"},{"id":"51806963","text":"Cara Cilano is currently the Chair Professor of English at Michigan State University< and also a published author of articles and books, being largely collected by libraries worldwide.

He is also the director of that institution's Center for Crime, Community and Law, and a professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health. Education and career Fagan received his B.A. from New York University in 1968, and his M.A. and Ph.D. from State University of New York at Buffalo in 1971 and 1975, respectively. Work Fagan researches multiple topics in the fields of criminal law and social policy, including capital punishment and racial profiling. For example, he is an outspoken critic of stop-and-frisk in New York City, and his research on the practice was a major factor in Shira Scheindlin's decision to strike it down as unconstitutional in 2013. This research includes a 2012 report he authored which found that about 95,000 NYPD stops under this program violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures, because police did not cite reasonable suspicion for conducting the stops in their forms. His research has also found that police stops are most effective in reducing crime when they are based on objectively suspicious behavior, which also reduces the chance that an innocent person will be detained. In 2016, he and Joscha Legewie co-authored a study that found that in the United States, police killings of blacks were higher in cities with more racial polarization, especially when the city has two ethnic groups of equal population. They also found that this effect can be reduced by hiring more black police officers. Honors, awards, and positions In 2000, Fagan received the Bruce Smith Sr. Award from the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences. From 2002 to 2005 he received the Investigator Award in Health Policy Research from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and was named a Soros Senior Justice Fellow by the Open Society Foundations from 2005 to 2006. He served on the Committee on Law and Justice of the National Academy of Sciences from 2000 to 2006. He served on the MacArthur Foundation's Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice from 1996 to 2006. He is a fellow of the American Society of Criminology. Editorial activities Fagan serves on the editorial boards of several criminology and law journals. He is a former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency.

Leidholm, Supreme Court of North Dakota, 334 N.W.2d 811 (1983) An objective standard of reasonableness requires the finder of fact to view the circumstances from the standpoint of a hypothetical reasonable person, absent the unique particular physical and psychological characteristics of the defendant. A subjective standard of reasonableness asks whether the circumstances would produce an honest and reasonable belief in a person having the particular mental and physical characteristics of the defendant, such as their personal knowledge and personal history, when the same circumstances might not produce the same in a general reasonable person. A case differentiating the standards is State v. Leidholm (1983). People v.

It was recorded at two sessions in 1954, originally released on two ten-inch LPs, and re-released in 1960 on a twelve-inch LP on the Contemporary label.Contemporary Records discography accessed September 29, 2016 Background The first session (The Three) features Manne on drums, Rogers on trumpet, and Giuffre on clarinet, tenor and baritone sax. The second session (The Two) features Manne on drums and Russ Freeman on piano. The musicians had long experience playing alongside each other in various contexts, and when the album was recorded were performing together in the popular West Coast group Shorty Rogers and His Giants. During live appearances, they often performed free improvisations, or unusual renditions of popular songs, as a trio or as a duo. The sessions forming this record follow the same experimental approach, combining some original compositions and some re-interpretations of jazz standards, exploring different musical forms (including some reminding of European classical music), pursuing interplay and counterpoint, and researching new sound textures, as was often the case in Manne's work. The album contains perhaps the earliest recorded examples of free jazz and free improvisation. Reception The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states: \\"Although these selections were not influential, they rank second in chronological order (behind Lennie Tristano's performances of 1949) among free jazz records.

Svend was a warrior and crusader who participated in numerous wars and raids with the Danish king. Contemporary historian Saxo Grammaticus mentions him as belonging to the inner circle of Valdemar I and Absalon. Svend may be best known for granting the Cistercian order large gifts of land which resulted in the founding of √òm Abbey by Moss√∏. It is known Svend was ordained bishop no later than 1166. Svend allowed Niels of Aarhus to be buried in Aarhus' St. Nicolai Cathedral after reports of miracles around the body and in connection with the burial. In the 1160s sources mention Svend with Absalon and Prince Buris in connection with the conquest of Wolgast. When R√ºgen was conquered in 1169 he received the surrender with Absalon and when the heathen relics was carried out of the city he stood on top of them. In the 1170s he participated in the conquest of Stettin and during the rebellion in Sk√•ne Svend begged Valdemar to be merciful. Apart from the last occurrence Svend is primarily described and seen as a warrior. he primary sources concerning Svend's relation to √òm Abbey comes from √òmbogen, the records kept by the Cistercian monks at the abbey. Characteristic for the book is that Svend is described very favorably, likely as a result of his many generous gifts to the abbey over the years. The abbey had previously been situated in Sminge, Veng and on Kalv√∏ in Skanderborg lake, founded on land donated by Bishop Eskil. Svend successively gifted the abbey large numbers of books and amounts of land and from at least 1183 Svend had a will benefiting the abbey. When Svend died most of the land owned by √òm Abbey had been gifted by Svend. The many large gifts to the abbey became a heated subject in the years hence. There's evidence that Svend not only gifted lands owned by himself but also lands of the Diocese of Aarhus. The bishop Tyge I (1261~1272) was involved in a long and heated feud with the abbey over the rights to the lands. Svend's wills and letters were used extensively as evidence. Svend I died in √òstrup, possibly Alb√¶k, in 1191 and was buried in √òm Abbey.

The GF&A; Railway bought the Carrabelle, Tallahassee and Georgia Railroad in 1906, which ran from Tallahassee south to Carrabelle. The Georgia, Florida and Alabama Railway, which extended from Richland, Georgia to Carrabelle, Florida at its greatest extent, became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1927. Seaboard Air Line would become part of CSX Transportation by 1986. GF&A; track north of Bainbridge is now part of the Georgia Southwestern Railroad.

Traditionally known as the place in which the kings of Thomond were installed, most notably the O'Briens, the site itself consists of numerous monuments, including a mound, standing stone, fulacht fiadh and a bullaun stone. A complex of vocal importance for the county and indeed the whole island, located in the monument-rich area of Dangan, Magh Adhair is a site of epitome cultural and historical significance.  History  The site has not been excavated nor dated as of 2016, so the era in which the complex was first in use is mere speculation, though the mound is likely to have been built anywhere from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age due to the nature of the monuments. It is likely the site has been in use over various phases, in continuation for at least 1,500 years. It has been suggested by Irish antiquarians, most notably John O'Donovan and T. J. Westropp, that the name \\"Magh Adhair\\" originally signified a very large area, perhaps the entire \\"Cl√°r\\", or plain, from which County Clare receives its name from. They believed this area steadily shrunk until it referred to only the field in which the monument stands, along with an adjacent area known as \\"Moyross/Moyree Park\\".James Frost The History and Topography of the County of Clare \\"Ree\\" usually stems from the word \\"r√≠\\" meaning a king, though in this instance may be open to interpretation. The earliest references to the site are mentioned in the Irish Annals - as seen in the Annals of the Four Masters - A.D. 981. Maelseacchlainn, the son of Domhnall plundered Dal gCais and prostrated the Bile of Magh Adhair, having dug at it with its roots out of the ground. A.D. 1051. The Tree of Magh Adhair was prostrated by Hugh O'Conor. A \\"Bile\\" usually signifies an Irish tree of some religious or otherwise otherworldly significance, and it is evident from these excerpts that the cutting of such a tree was a serious offense. It is stated in the Lecan records that Amhalghaidh Mac Fiachrach raised the mound of Magh Adhair as a tomb for himself, and so that his progeny would conduct fairs around his mound, and his heirs inaugurated on it. Indeed, fair gatherings or \\"irachts\\" were noted to have taken place as late as the 19th century, the last known fair to have been in 1838, but possibly to have been still conducted as late as the Great Famine. It is said in both Frost's History and Topography of the County of Clare and O'Donovan & O'Curry's ordnance survey letters of 1839, that the mound received its name from a chieftain of the Fir Bolg, Adhair, the son of Umor and brother of Aengus, the latter of which was reputedly responsible for building the cliff-fort of Dun Aengus on the Aran Islands.John O'Donovan & Eugene O'Curry The Antiquities of County Clare, According to the Book of Invasions and later mythological traditions, the Fir Bolg were driven into Connaught after being defeated by the Tuatha D√© Danann - Clare, being west of the Shannon, was deemed part of Connaught at this time, and therefore the residence of a Fir Bolg colony. Once Clare was colonised by the Gaelic Milesians, sometime between the late Iron Age and the coming of Christianity in the 5th Century, (it has been suggested sometime circa 100AD) the site was continually used by the people that would eventually become known as the Dal gCais Multiple references to the site are also mentioned in the Caithreim Thoirdhealbhaigh, an account of the conflict between the Anglo-Norman insurgents and Gaelic nobility of Thomond in the 13th and 14th centuries, as seen in the following: > His chiefs assembled around Dermot, the son of Donogh, who was son of Brian > Roe O'Brien at Moy Eyre to invest him with the chieftainship, and the tower- > like hero was solemnly inaugurated. It was Loghlin, the son of Cumee, who > first installed him and the states (tribes) unanimously consented. As the > bad of Dermot said on the occasion:- > Let us give the title of King, > (which will be of much fame > To the land which has chosen him) > To the valorous griffin > The son of the fair-formed Donogh > Of the sealed secrets > Generous heir of generous Blood* > The puissant Donogh of fortresses. > He is kind to the church, > He is head over all, > The heart of the territories, > A tree under blossom. > Dermot of Dun Mor > The mild, lively, fierce, > Received the hostages > Through his wisdom and sword > His gracious smile and pomp > He exhibits with grace > And since he has commenced his career > His fame has spread afar > Momonia of Bards > Is his principality > Proclaim we him King > Of his tribes with great joy.Caithreim Thoirdhealbhaigh, Irish Texts > Society edition *Blood refers to the U√≠ mBloid sept of Thomond, an umbrella term used for much of the tribes of east Clare, especially those of the Slieve Aughty and Slieve Bearnagh mountains. The site, though having a predominantly O'Brien connection, has traditionally been in the territory of the O'Hehirs, who were later ousted by the MacNamaras.P. W. White History of Clare and the Dalcassian Clans The mound has also been named \\"Cregnakeeroge\\" - A \\"Ciar√≥g\\" usually signifies an insect, specifically a beetle.  Features  The mound itself is of an irregular ovular shape, much degraded by the presence of cattle. Surrounded by a fosse, there is a bridging point to the central flat platform at the western side of the mound. Adjacent to this, to the west, is a satellite mound or cairn, notably stonier and smaller in its dimensions than the central structure, the latter of which is made largely of soil. To the north of the mound lies a bullaun stone, containing two depressions which fill with water fed by rainfall. North and west of this are a series of enclosures and what is described as the site of a battle taking place in 877 AD, according to the ordnance survey map. Bordering the entire site to the west is the Hell river, and past that again, a standing stone, referred to as a \\"ligaun\\". The central site is situated at the base of an amphitheatre of low hills, prone to flooding from the river. To the east of the site is a turlough and fulacht fiadh. The area in which the site is located is renowned for one rich in the presence of ringforts, the largest of which being the nearby triple-ringed fort of Cahercalla.

The friary was accidentally burned in 1536 and was rebuilt by Brian Ballach O'Rourke. In 1590 Richard Bingham stabled his horses at Creevelea during his pursuit of Brian O'Rourke, who had sheltered survivors of the Spanish Armada. Dissolved c. 1598. Sir Tadhg O'Rourke (d. 1605), last King of West Br√©ifne and Thaddeus Francis O'Rourke (d. 1735), Bishop of Killala are buried here. Another house was built for the friars in 1618 and Creevelea was reoccupied by friars in 1642. The Franciscans were driven out by the Cromwellian Army in the 1650s. After the Restoration, the abbey remained in use until 1837. Buildings The remains consist of the church (nave, chancel, transept and choir), chapter house, cloister and domestic buildings. The bell-tower was converted to living quarters in the 17th century. At one point in its history the church was covered with a thatched roof. Carved in the cloister is an image of Saint Francis of Assisi preaching to birds. Archaeological Preservation The site is preserved as a national monument.

Today, the line runs from the Clearwater Subdivision in Sulphur Springs, Florida north to a point just north of Brooksville, a distance of 49.1 miles. Historically, the Brooksville Subdivision was owned and operated by CSX predecessor, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. Under Seaboard ownership, the Brooksville Subdivision continued north as far as Waldo, where it intercepted the Seaboard Air Line main line (which is now CSX's S Line).Seaboard Air Line Railroad South Florida Division Timetable (1940) Currently, the Brooksville Subdivision notably serves a Florida Crushed Stone Company facility in Brooksville along with a Cemex facility.CSX Brooksville SubCSX Jacksonville Division Timetable History =Sulphur Springs to Brooksville= The line from Brooksville south to Fivay Junction (near the present-day intersection of US 41 and SR 52) was originally built by the Brooksville and Hudson Railroad in 1902. The Brooksville and Hudson Railroad was a logging railroad owned by the Aripeka Sawmills Inc. In 1907, the Brooksville and Hudson Railroad was bought by the Tampa Northern Railroad. The Tampa Northern then built track from Tampa to Fivay and rebuilt the Brooksville and Hudson Railroad from there to Brooksville. The line was completed in 1908. The Tampa Northern Railroad was bought by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1912. =Brooksville to Waldo= At its greatest extent, the Brooksville Subdivision extended as far north as Waldo. Track from Waldo to Archer was built in 1861 by the Florida Railroad (later the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad) which extended as far as Cedar Key. In 1890, track was built from Archer south to Early Bird. The Seaboard Air Line bought the FC&P; network in 1900 and in 1911, the line was extended south of Early Bird to Inverness. The extension from Early Bird to Inverness ran closely parallel the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad's High Springs‚ÄìLakeland Line. In 1925, the Brooksville and Inverness Railway, a Seaboard subsidiary, was built connecting Inverness with the former Tampa Northern Railroad in Brooksville. This would create an additional freight route from northern Florida to the Tampa Bay region as an alternative to the Seaboard main line. Around the same time, track from Inverness to Waldo was upgraded with heavier rail, and the Seaboard main line was double-tracked from Waldo north to Baldwin which further increased capacity. After track from Archer to Cedar Key was abandoned in 1932, the full line from Waldo to Sulpher Springs was designated as the Brooksville Subdivision. By 1940, the Seaboard was running a daily through freight train round-trip on the line. =Later years= The Seaboard Air Line became the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in 1967 after merging with their former rival, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. In the combined network, the full line was largely redundant due to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad's nearly parallel route as well as its own main line to Tampa. The Seaboard Coast Line abandoned the Brooksville Subdivision between Waldo and Brooksville in the 1970s (which nearly restored the Tampa Northern Railroad's original terminus ironically). The line now ends near the Broco Quarry just north of Brooksville. Despite the abandonment, the line's SR mileposts numbers remain as they did when the full line was intact. In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the Chessie System, creating the CSX Corporation. The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation.

Nineteen stations of the subway system were projects she participated in or led. She was honored with many awards during her career, including the designation in 1985 of Early life Nina Aleksandrovna was born on 17 July 1924 in Moscow, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Soviet Union. She was the granddaughter of the Archpriest of the Church of the Resurrection of Christ at Tarusa, Nikolai Uspensky, () and his wife Nadezhda Danilovna Yakhontova (), whose children became intellectuals and musicians. She graduated from music school in the same year that the German invasion of Russia occurred. She studied piano, before studying architecture at the Moscow Institute of Architecture under the tutelage of , graduating in 1950. Career Aleshina began her career in the workshop of Alexey Dushkin, working on drawings for the renovation of the Novoslobodskaya station, which had been completed years before. She focused on wall and pylon treatments, while her husband, the artist Nikolai Aleshin worked in their home sketching images for stained glass. She designed the vestibule of the station, which led into two lobbies. It was the first project of twenty she was involved in for the Moscow subway system. At the end of the Khrushchev era, Aleshina almost quit working on the metro, but changed her mind. From 1981 to 1991, Aleshina served as the chief architect of the Institute of . It was difficult, as she was serving as the head of the design department for the entire metro system, while still completing her own designs. Aleshina visited construction sites daily to keep the architects and the builders working together and she had a reputation as a perfectionist, who insisted on performance, but who was also highly respected by the engineers and foremen she worked with. In her later career, Aleshina wrote a history, documenting design details, and the unique features of each station in the subway system for the Moscow Heritage Committee. Death and recognition Aleshina died in Moscow on 17 November 2012 and was buried on Vvedenskoye Cemetery next to her husband and daughter. In addition to prizes recognizing her work, she was honored as a Knight of the Order of the Badge of Honour and received the Medal \\"For Labour Valour\\". Projects The Moscow Metro Station project began in 1931 and the challenge was given to designers to plan spaces which overcame the feeling of being underground and instead managed to artistically provide a space which was functional and able to move trains and people efficiently, yet aesthetically pleasing. Initially, natural materials were predominant, but after 1958, Metrogiprotrans turned to concrete, paint and tile. In the early period, most of the lobby entrances were through larger buildings, but in the austerity movement of the 1950s, a change was made to smaller, pavilion structures. Throughout the 1960s, utilitarian prefabricated structures dominated, but their size increased as the 1970s dawned. The shallow column design, nicknamed the \\"centipede\\" because of its ribbed beam ceilings across a central hall with two rows of columns, was the typical design style of most of the stations. Though Aleshina changed the shapes of the columns and decorative treatments in the stations she designed, it was a challenge to make each station original, as upon descending the entrance to the platform the 150-meter-long ribbed ceiling was always what first caught passengers' eyes. =1950s and 1960s projects= 1962, Leninsky Prospekt station, was a collaboration by Aleshina with lead architect and , Valentina Polikarpova (), and Anna Marova (). The design was simple, featuring an above ground pavilion made completely of glass, shaded by a wide eave above which was a decorative concrete lattice. Descending into the deep covered escalator, the design used an overlapping step technique rather than a curved cylindrical vault keeping with the step design of the platform area. Pillars, which widened as they ascended, flanked the hallway. The square columns were faced with light colored marble and were narrower on the sides running the length of the hall than on the wider sides facing the platforms. Underneath each pillar was a yellowish-brown \\"mat\\" of marble. The walls were tiled in a diamond shaped grid with light colored ceramic tiles. The floor was composed of gray and brown granite of intentionally irregular shape. 1962, Oktyabrskaya station, also known as the \\"October\\" station was another joint design project by Aleshina with Strelkov and Vdovin. The design was reflective of in the 1960s. The station featured a wide, sloping canopy over the glass entrance. The front fa√ßade was divided into the glassed area and an open brickwork lattice with alternating vertical and horizontal holes. The pylons of the platform hall, which sloped and widened near the top, were lined with light- colored marble. Above the posts were cornices, where the lighting fixtures were mounted. Tiled walls of black and white lined the track and the flooring was tiled with gray and red granite. 1962, Profsoyuznaya station, also known as the \\"Trade Union\\" station teamed Aleshina and for the project. There was no above ground lobby built. Access came through descending from either Profsoyuznaya Street or Nakhimovsky Prospekt Avenue. It was a prefabricated structure built to a standard design plan. The hallway featured 40 columns faced with wavy, blue-gray marble. The platform walls along the tracks were made of white glazed ceramic tiles set on a diagonal above a black base of horizontal tiles. The floor was paved with red and gray granite. 1966, Ryazansky Prospekt station was a collaboration by Aleshina and Yury Vdovin, which had a two small lobbies on Ryazan Avenue. It was not precast to the standard specifications, but instead was a narrower version of the typical station. Square columns, lined with blue-gray marble from Ufaley flanked the hallway. Around each column was a \\"mat\\" of red marble, but the rest of the floor was paved with gray granite. The track walls were covered in white ceramic tiles above a black base and were capped with red ornamentation which reflected a typical pattern used on doilies or woven work from the Ryazan region. 1966, Taganskaya station was a joint design project by Aleshina with Yury Vdovin and sculptor Eduard M. Ladygin (). The columns in the hallway were lined with light-colored marble, bordered in red marble, with walls of black and white ceramic tiles. Lighting was hidden behind the eaves. Embossed panels on the walls, made by Ladigin represented the theme of \\"The Conquest of Space\\". The floor paving was gray and red granite. 1969, Varshavskaya station, also known as the \\"Warsaw\\" station, teamed Aleshina and Natalya K. Samoilova (). Construction began in 1969 and extensively utilized Gazgan marble, which naturally transitions in color gradation from cream to black, to create a polychrome expanse, which was broken by rows of columns that were wide at the header and tapered, diminishing in size toward the base. =1970s projects= 1972, Oktyabrskoye Pole station, also known as the \\"October field\\" station was a collaboration by Aleshina with L. N. Zaytseva () and Latvian sculptors D≈æems Bodnieks and . The underground passages were accessed from People's Militia and Marshal Birjuzova streets. The hallway featured fluted columns encased in aluminum, which were set atop a gray granite flooring strip. The rest of the floor paving was white marble. Walls along the track were black marble at the base and transitioned to a light gray marble for the main surface. Affixed to the walls were inserts sculpted in anodized aluminum by Bodniek and Rysin featuring Soviet themes. 1975, Kuznetsky Most station was another joint design project with Samoilova, as well as with the artist Mikhail N. Alekseev (). The station design utilized arcades of columns and arches, evoking supports on a viaduct, formed of blue-gray, grained marble. The walls on the accompanying track were decorated with inlays of wrought aluminum depicting blacksmithing, such as sparks flying from an anvil, the tongs and hammer of the forge, weapons and tools which a smith might use or create in his work. Soft fluorescent lighting in a ribbed rhomboid structure were placed in the ceiling arch to illuminate the walkways, The architects were awarded the Prize of the USSR by the Council of Ministers, in 1977. 1975, Lubyanka station was a renovation of a project originally completed in 1935 by Nikolai Ladovsky. Aleshina and Strelkov were hired to reconstruct \\"Dzerzhinskaya\\" station, connecting it to the new Kuznetsky Most station and creating an actual station with a central hall. Because of the degraded conditions of the original site, the two circular concrete cylinders which had been built for the trains, were replaced with steel tubing. The soil surrounding the site was a type of quicksand which required the engineers to freeze it to a depth of thirty meters before construction could begin. Though criticized for not remaining true to the original design, Aleshina explained that the original barrel shape of the station was impractical and the tunnel diameters were too small to join with the more modern stations. She also explained that the style of it would not have worked well with the addition of a central hall. The grey marble, which had originally lined the cylinders was replaced with white tiling, though a fragment of the former tunnel was retained. The pillars of the station were lined in white marble and the flooring was paved with black and red granite. 1975, Shchukinskaya station, like Kuznetsky Most station, teamed Aleshina with Samoilova and Alekseev. The design featured fluted columns of yellowish Gazgan marble in which the vertical grooves were filled with an anodized aluminum and bronze alloy. The floor detailing featured a gray granite in an open chain traveling the length of the hallway and the walls were lined with red Ukrainian marmor. Affixed to the walls were corrugated aluminum panels of the same anodized aluminum and bronze. It was the first time the material had been used on such a large scale, as previously, it was used to prohibit corrosion on helicopter blades. 1978, Medvedkovo station was another collaboration of Aleshina and Natalya K. Samoilova and with participation by V. S. Volovich () and again featured artworks by M. N. Alekseev. The prefabricated structure featured rows of 26 columns, lined in yellow and pink grained marble which had stainless steel inserts. Track walls were lined with red marble and featured anodized aluminum and bronze panels with pyramid-shaped forms to signify ice. The theme of the station was northern nature and decorative inserts in the metal panels depicted scenes of the environment. Alekseev's sculpted inserts showed various images including geese in flight, a hunter taking aim at geese and another hunting bear, a polar bear on an ice floe, a sled pulled by reindeer, and other images. The flooring was gray and black granite paving. 1979, Marksistskaya station also known as the \\"Marxist\\" station was a joint design project with Volovich and Samoilova with participation by R. P. Tkacheva () and the artist Alekseev. The station was one of Aleshina's personal favorites and she described it as the \\"most beautiful subway in the world\\". The design of the station was supposed to convey the strength and purity of Marxist ideology. In that vein, the hall of the station was faced with red Burovshina marble on the columns and a pink Gazgan marble on the walls with black granite at the base. The pink and red marble came from the area near Lake Baikal. Alekseev created panels on the end wall and above the passageways in the style of Florentine mosaic which depict Marxist themes. The chandeliers were made of optical glass which had to be reduced in thickness because of the weight of the spiral fixtures. 1979, Perovo station, like the Marxist station, teamed Aleshina and Volovich, with participation by Samoilova and Tkachev. The station was poured concrete with a shallow vaulted ceiling, featuring arts and crafts as a theme. On the walls, white marble slabs alternated with carved stone compositions, united by floral motifs, adorning the walls. The carved stones feature mythological creatures including a gamayun, a phoenix, a winged horse, other birds and both a happy and sad sun. The floors were made of black and brown granite. The lighting was inset into the ceiling in a pointed zig-zag design feature. Along the length, the middle of the station featured five marble clustered pillars surrounded by bench seating. In 1980, the design was awarded a certificate from the Union of Architects. =1980s and 1990s projects= 1983, Serpukhovskaya station was a collaboration by Aleshina with and Lydia Y. Gonchar (). The columns of the central hall were faced with Gazgan marble in warm tones and had metallic accents. The hall was tubular in shape and was the first of the Metro stations to use fiber optic lighting on a message board. The platform lighting was traditional fluorescent bulbs. Walls on the track were faced with white marble. The station was decorated in themes based on ancient cities near Moscow by the painter Lyubov A. Novikova () and the sculptor T. B. Taborovskaya. 1983, Chertanovskaya station was a solo shallow column project designed by Aleshina. It was constructed of precast, reinforced concrete for which Aleshina personally oversaw the concrete and finishing work. The 26 star-shaped columns on each side of the central hallway were joined by arches. Pyramid-shaped crystal chandeliers provided the lighting. Both the columns and track walls were faced with white marble. Walls featured metal inlays designed by Alekseev and Novikova, who also created mosaics on the southern entrance lobby based on the theme \\"Constructing a new Moscow\\". The floor was paved with a geometric pattern of red and black granite. 1985, Domodedovskaya station was another collaborative design between Aleshina and Samoilova, with the artist Mikhail Alekseev. The theme of the station was aviation and it was built on the standard plan of two tracks flanking a column-lined central hallway. Columns and walls were faced with white and gray grained marble and copper insets depicting aircraft adorned the walls. The floor featured a geometric pattern of alternating gray and black granite. The lighting mimicked that found in the passenger cabin of an airplane. 1988, Mendeleyevskaya station was a joint design project of Aleshina and Samoilova using columns connected by arches to form an arcade in a traditional Russian style. Columns were faced in white marble and the walls along the track were made of grey marble with reddish veining. The theme of the station was Dmitri Mendeleev's scientific works and at one end of the central hall was a portrait of Mendeleev and his periodic table. Inserted into the walls were decorations created by L. Kremnevoy () of stylized depictions of atoms and molecular structures. The lighting utilized balls of varying sizes fixed inside a structure resembling a molecular lattice. The floor was paved with gray granite. 1990, Podbelskogo Street station returned to the team of Aleshina, Samoilova and Alekseev. The station was named after Vadim Podbelsky, a twentieth century statesman and party leader and featured a sculpted bust of Podbelsky created by Alekseev. A standard reinforced concrete project, the design had two rows of 26 columns faced with white marble. Affixed to the walls were striped metal panels and the floor was gray granite with narrow strips of red and black detailing. In 2014, the station was renamed to the Bulvar Rokossovskogo station, as the street on which its primary entrance was located had been renamed in 1994. 1995, Chkalovskaya station was a collaborative effort between Aleshina, Leonid L. Borzenkov (), and with assistance by T. V. Chistyakova (). The station was dedicated to the pilot Valery Chkalov and based on an aviation theme. The lobby featured stylized welded metal elements resembling aircraft. The ceiling arches and pylon designs were created to resemble the shape of an airplane wing and fuselage. Station columns were made of a blue-gray veined marble reminiscent of the sky with decorative shiny metallic elements. At the ends of the hall ceramic panels designed by Mikhail Alekseev and L. A. Novikova depicted clouds swirling around the globe. The walls of the tracks were faced with light colored marble at the top and a dark marble at the bottom, while the floor was paved with black and gray granite.

Here, the line connects with the Auburndale Subdivision, CSX's only line to South Florida and the Miami area. Freight trains bound for Miami from the rest of the country generally come off the Vitis Subdivision and run the Carters Subdivision to reach Miami. The McDonald Connection track connects the Carters Subdivision from the south with the Auburndale Subdivision and the Can Yard Lead connects it in the north direction. Operation Much of the freight service on the Carters Subdivision is to and from the Miami area and customers down the Auburndale Subdivision. Local freight also runs on the line with a number of customers located on the Park Spur just east of Lakeland. Local freight bound for Taft Yard and customers on the Central Florida Rail Corridor in the Orlando area also run the line. No through freight to northern Florida runs on the Central Florida Rail Corridor. The Carters Subdivision also hosts Amtrak's Silver Meteor and Silver Star trains daily. The Silver Star trains run the entire route to reach Tampa, while both trains run to Auburndale Interlocking to turn towards Miami. History The Carters Subdivision first began service in 1884 and was built as part of Henry B. Plant's South Florida Railroad, which extended from Sanford to Tampa. Crews building the line from each end met up and completed the line just east of Lakeland at a location called Carter's Kill, which the Carters Subdivision is named for. The South Florida Railroad was absorbed by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. The Atlantic Coast Line became part of CSX Transportation by 1986. Prior to 2011, the Carters Subdivision's north end was at Auburndale Interlocking and the A Line north of Auburndale Interlocking and the entire Central Florida Rail Corridor was part of the Sanford Subdivision. After CSX sold the A Line north of Poinciana to the Florida Department of Transportation to create the Central Florida Rail Corridor, the Sanford Subdivision was truncated at Deland and the Carters Subdivision designation was extended up the A Line to Poinciana.

Today, the line ends at 5th Avenue North in St. Petersburg. Though, some severed track segments remain between I-375 and Tropicana Field. In 2015, CSX proposed to sell both the Clearwater and Brooksville subdivisions to the Florida Department of Transportation for potential use as commuter rail. FDOT is currently studying this possibility. Similar transactions between FDOT and CSX have taken place in the Miami and Orlando areas for tracks that today run the Tri-Rail and SunRail commuter lines respectively.

The overall goal of normalization is to minimize effects arising from variations in experimental errors, such as inconsistent sample preparation, unequal sample loading across gel lanes, or uneven protein transfer, which can compromise the conclusions that can be obtained from Western blot data. Currently, there are two methods for normalizing Western blot data: (i) housekeeping protein normalization and (ii) total protein normalization.  Procedure  Normalization occurs directly on either the gel or the blotting membrane. First, the stained gel or blot is imaged, a rectangle is drawn around the target protein in each lane, and the signal intensity inside the rectangle is measured. The signal intensity obtained can then be normalized with respect to the signal intensity of the loading internal control detected on the same gel or blot. When using protein stains, the membrane may be incubated with the chosen stain before or after immunodetection, depending on the type of stain.  Housekeeping protein controls  Housekeeping genes and proteins, including Œ≤-Actin, GAPDH, HPRT1, and RPLP1, are often used as internal controls in western blots because they are thought to be expressed constitutively, at the same levels, across experiments. However, recent studies have shown that expression of housekeeping proteins (HKPs) can change across different cell types and biological conditions. Therefore, scientific publishers and funding agencies now require that normalization controls be previously validated for each experiment to ensure reproducibility and accuracy of the results. = Fluorescent antibodies = When using fluorescent antibodies to image proteins in western blots, normalization requires that the user define the upper and lower limits of quantitation and characterize the linear relationship between signal intensity and the sample mass volume for each antigen. Both the target protein and the normalization control need to fluoresce within the dynamic range of detection. Many HKPs are expressed at high levels and are preferred for use with highly-expressed target proteins. Lower expressing proteins are difficult to detect on the same blot. Fluorescent antibodies are commercially available, and fully characterized antibodies are recommended to ensure consistency of results. When fluorescent detection is not utilized, the loading control protein and the protein of interest must differ considerably in molecular weight so they are adequately separated by gel electrophoresis for accurate analysis. = Membrane stripping = Membranes need to be stripped and re-probed using a new set of detection antibodies when detecting multiple protein targets on the same blot. Ineffective stripping could result in a weak signal from the target protein. To prevent loss of the antigen, only three stripping incubations are recommended per membrane. It could be difficult to completely eliminate signal from highly-abundant proteins, so it is recommended that one detects lowly-expressed proteins first. = Exogenous spike-in controls = Since HKP levels can be inconsistent between tissues, scientists can control for the protein of interest by spiking in a pure, exogenous protein of a known concentration within the linear range of the antibody. Compared to HKP, a wider variety of proteins are available for spike-in controls.  Total protein normalization  In total protein normalization (TPN), the abundance of the target protein is normalized to the total amount of protein in each lane. Because TPN is not dependent on a single loading control, validation of controls and stripping/reprobing of blots for detection of HKPs is not necessary. This can improve precision (down to 0.1 ¬µg of total protein per lane), cost-effectiveness, and data reliability. Fluorescent stains and stain-free gels require special equipment to visualize the proteins on the gel/blot. Stains may not cover the blot evenly; more stain might collect towards the edges of the blot than in the center. Non-uniformity in the image can result in inaccurate normalization. = Pre-antibody stains = Anionic dyes such as Ponceau S and Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and fluorescent dyes like Sypro Ruby and Deep Purple, are used before antibodies are added because they do not affect downstream imumunodetection. Ponceau S is a negatively charged reversible dye that stains proteins a reddish pink color and is removed easily by washing in water. The intensity of Ponceau S staining decreases quickly over time, so documentation should be conducted rapidly. A linear range of up to 140 ¬µg is reported for Ponceau S with poor reproducibility due to its highly time-dependent staining intensity and low signal-to-noise ratio. Fluorescent dyes like Sypro Ruby have a broad linear range and are more sensitive than anionic dyes. They are permanent, photostable stains that can be visualized with a standard UV or blue-light transilluminator or a laser scan. Membranes can then be documented either on film or digitally using a CCD camera. Sypro Ruby blot staining is time- intensive and tends to saturate above 50 Œºg of protein per lane. = Post- antibody stains = Amido black is a commonly used permanent post-antibody anionic stain that is more sensitive than Ponceau S. This stain is applied after imumunodetection. = Stain-free technology = Stain-free technology employs an in-gel chemistry for imaging. This chemical reaction does not affect protein transfer or downstream antibody binding. Also, it does not involve staining/destaining steps, and the intensity of the bands remain constant over time. Stain-free technology cannot detect proteins that do not contain tryptophan residues. A minimum of two tryptophans is needed to enable detection. The linear range for stain-free normalization is up to 80 ¬µg of protein per lane for 18-well and up to 100 ¬µg per lane for 12-well Criterion mid-sized gels. This range is compatible with typical protein loads in quantitative western blots and enables loading control calculations over a wide protein-loading range. A more efficient stain-free method has also recently become available. When using high protein loads, stain-free technology has demonstrated greater success than stains.

She was the wife of cellist G√ºnther Johannes Paetsch and the mother to their seven children. Early life Priscilla McClure Johnson was born in Evanston, Illinois, United States, on 18 November 1931, her parents were Harry McClure Johnson (1886‚Äì1932) a prominent Chicago Attorney and Helena Modjeska Chase (1900‚Äì1986) an artist. She was the fifth child of Harry Johnson who died on 29 March 1932 (from a sudden attack of influenza which developed into pneumonia) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada where he was visiting his mother. He died when she was only 4 months old. Although she was reared all over the country, she considers Steamboat Springs, Colorado the closest thing to a hometown because she spent her summers there on her mothers horse ranch called the Pine Springs Ranch. She is the youngest sister of Mansi McClure Johnson (1924-2013), Harry McClure Johnson (1925-2007), Elizabeth McIlvaine Johnson (1926-2017), and Sarah Jane McClure Johnson (1929-2013). At the age of 15 (1946) she wrote and illustrated (with beautiful drawings of horses) the children's book \\"How the Eggplant Came to Be\\" that was published by the Adventure Trails Publication and were written at her mother's 'Pine Springs Ranch' in Steamboat Springs, CO. Education From 1946 until 1950, Priscilla McClure Johnson was educated at The Putney School in Vermont, which had an excellent Music Department, majoring in violin, chamber music, and orchestral playing. She continued her education at Bennington College in Vermont from 1950 ‚Äì 1952 majoring in violin performance. At the University of Wyoming, she received a Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) with major in Violin, and in 1956 a Master of Arts degree (MA) with major in Music Composition, with highest donors. She wrote her Thesis about \\"An Analysis of Strawinsky's Symphony in Three Movements\\" on 24 April 1956 and her Thesis about \\"Some Aspects of Bach's Technique in the Solo Violin Sonatas and Suites\\" on 1 May 1956. She also studied at the Aspen Institute of Music in Colorado from 1954 ‚Äì 1955 and at the Detmold Musikhochschule in Germany in 1957. She studied with Madame Eckstein, Frederic Balazs (1st violinist of the Maverick String Quartet of Woodstock, NY; conductor of the Tucson Sym. Orch), Fritz Rikko (Faculty of Putney School and Juilliard; cond. violinist, violist), Gideon Grau (Putney faculty), Orreo Pernel (Bennington Faculty; Primier Prix in Paris Conservatoire), Szymon Goldberg (Solo violinist in Europe and America, faculty of Aspen Institute of Music, who she later sent her daughter, Michaela to study with at Yale University and Curtis Institute of Music), Claus Adam (cellist of the Juilliard String Quartet, who taught chamber music), George Finkle (cellist at the Maverick Theater in Woodstock, NY who taught cello and chamber music at Hickory Ridge School and Putney School and Bennington College), Tibor Varga, and David Oistrakh. From 1954 - 1955 she was professor of violin, viola and chamber music at the University of Wyoming. From 1955 - 1956 she instructed violin, viola and chamber music at Colorado College (Colorado Springs, Colorado). She was Music Director of World Tour as a violinist and composer from 1956 - 1957 through the Putney Graduate School of Teacher Education. World tour In the winter of 1956 Priscilla's mother, who had put all of her 5 children through college decided to do something for herself: Take a tour of Europe. Priscilla, an expert horse trainer, worked all summer to get enough money to help her mother to go. Priscilla drove her mother from Colorado Springs to Vermont where graduate students from the Putney Graduate School of Teacher Education where getting ready for the tour. She was invited to go with them with scholarship on a ship to Europe. She was dressed in her cowboy shirt and cowboy hat and Levi's and leather tasseled jacket and boots. She had her fiddle and guitar and some of her scores ... and ... one skirt, in case she was invited to dinner or something.The Paetsch Family Ensemble: Musically coming of age; by Robin Campbell, Colorado Springs Sun, 13 November 1977 That is how she headed out for Europe. She just had her slicker and bedroll. Through Gibraltar and Spain and Italy it was found out that she was the only one able to drive the truck at their disposal that had a 27 foot covered bed and a complicated gearing system. Their guide unfortunately abandoned everyone on the tour during Christmas with all their money - they eventually found him enjoying the nudist beaches in Palermo, Italy and got what money was left, back form him. She now had $500 and time on her hands she headed for Garmisch-Partenkirchen to visit a friend and the village of Absam where Jacob Stainer had lived and had built his superb violins some 300 years before. During this time she learned how to speak a number of languages, including Spanish and Italian, and almost fluent in German. G√ºnther On February 21, 1957, the 26 year old American violinist Priscilla McClure Johnson found the fairy-tale village of T√ºbingen, Germany with cobblestone streets, half-timbered houses, huge weeping willow branches overhanging the Neckar river, a beautifully restored medieval center and an old castle that dominates the hillside. As she walked the streets she heard a trumpet practicing as if there was a concert that night. She knocked on the door and asked someone nearby (a young man named Dietrich) if there was a concert that evening. She was told that there was and he happened to have an extra ticket to it and offered it to her. After she had checked into the youth hostel and tidied up the best she could she met Dietrich and went to where the concert was to take place and proceeded to hang up her coat in the Green room. She noticed an old Klotz violin lying on a piano. She admired it, the owner said to try it so she looked for a quiet corner. She saw a man playing a cello facing the corner playing one part of a two-part piece. So she went behind and played the other part and they played to the end. When they finished he looked around and Priscilla saw for the first time the face of the young handsome 28 year old G√ºnther Johannes Paetsch, the man from Germany who was to become her husband. T√ºbingen and the Nekar river.During the performance Priscilla sat in the audience between Dietrich, who happened to be G√ºnther's best friend and a girl named Isolde, who was G√ºnther's pianist and rather attached to the cellist. Priscilla was unaware of this and had eyes only for the handsome cellist with the eyes like stars. His playing was with flair and a tone with such musicality. she had never heard anything quite like it. Gunther spoke no English and Priscilla had only college German so the next day they played piano trios with Isolde for the entire day going through most of the literature just for the pleasure of it. They had fallen in love. The next two years or so Priscilla did not return to United States immediately but traveled and met new people and learned new languages and when she ran out of money she would play concerts. But she always returned every half year to visit with G√ºnther in Stuttgart (he had finished his studies and had by now been admitted into the bar). It was at this time that she walked to Iraq, learned Arabic and was caught up in the revolt there escaping unharmed. In 1957 Priscilla McClure Johnson was invited to be a member of the international jury representing the United States in the International Stringed Instrument Competition held in Moscow, Russia. Maurice Mar√©chal represented France, Priscilla M. Johnson represented the United States, and representing Russia and the president of the jury was David Oistrakh. Later she found herself in Norway and Finland, playing concert for the Sami people and walking up to Nordkapp, Norway in the dead of winter and nearly froze to death in the silent mountain passes where no vehicle could go. She had asked how far it is to Nordkapp and they told her it was about 4 miles, unaware that a Norwegian mile is about ten English miles. For two and a half years between 1956‚Äì59 she went on a World Study Trip, sponsored by the Putney Graduate School of Teacher Education, traveling over all of Europe, on both sides of the Iron Curtain, to Africa and the Middle East, to study the Music and the Educational Systems in 30 different countries, visiting numerous Music Schools and Conservatories, and seeking knowledge of the Compositions of Contemporary Composers. Priscilla and Gunther Paetsch on their wedding May 24th 1959 in Colorado SpringsPriscilla insisted that if they were to be married he must at least see the country and the life style from which she grew up (she also trained Polish-bred registered Arabian horses in Colorado). He agreed to come to America if she married him. Even though he couldn't speak a word of english he set out for the United States and found an openness and freedom that he had not known and stayed. She brought him out to her mothers 'Pine Springs Ranch' in Steamboat Springs, Colorado in June 1959. Children Priscilla McClure Johnson married G√ºnther Johannes Paetsch in Colorado Springs, CO on 24 May 1959 at the house of her mother. After their wedding, they went on a two-month honeymoon on the top the Continental divide the Colorado Rockies on three of her horses. One horse carried a pack of things they would need for the next 2 months. Priscilla and G√ºnther Paetsch on their Honeymoon Pack Trip. 2 months on the top of the Continental Divide in Colorado on horseback, 1959 When Priscilla Paetsch was younger she wasn't really interested in children but that changed when she met G√ºnther. When Priscilla was six she heard the Bach Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 for the first time and there and then made up her mind to become violinist so she could play that great work. This work actually requires nine individual players and it just happened that she met a cellist and they had seven children and they did play this work. Priscilla Paetsch had seven children in eleven years (1960-1971). Her first child, Phebe Verena Paetsch was born in 1960 in Denver, CO. Michaela Modjeska Paetsch was born in 1961 in Colorado Springs, as was Brigitte McClure Paetsch in 1963, Johann Sebastian Paetsch in 1964, Christian Friedeman Paetsch in 1966, Engelbert Raphael Paetsch in 1968, and Siegmund Amedeus Paetsch in 1971. Not only were Priscilla and Gunther professional musicians, but their 7 children (3 daughters and 4 sons) all learned to play string instruments as well. They would eventually form their own nine-piece group: The Paetsch Family Chamber Music Ensemble. Five of the siblings are now professional musicians. Michaela, the second oldest, broke new ground by joining the Colorado Springs Symphony (now called the Colorado Springs Philharmonic) at the age of 13, making her the youngest member ever. At one time, there were five Paetsch family members playing alongside each other in the orchestra. Priscilla and her second oldest, Michaela, shared a music stand. Johann, the fourth oldest and oldest son, joined the Colorado Springs Symphony when he was 13 as the youngest cellist ever.Bev Reeves. \\"Paetsch delights Loveland\\" from the Loveland Daily Reporter-Herald, Tuesday, 20 Dec. 1977. Brigitte, the third child, also joined soon after to play in the violin section. Later Christian was to join. Starting in 1967 Priscilla was professor of violin and viola and chamber music at the Cosmic Heights School of Music in Colorado Springs. She wrote; \\"During all these years from 1960 on, I also was the mother of seven children, born between concerts - I never missed a concert - who all became musicians, some of them world-class concert artists and soloists under my training.\\" Gunther, Priscilla and their seven children.

From 1960 ‚Äì 1961 she was music director of the Arvada Symphony (CO) and stringed instrument teacher in R-1 School District in Arvada, Colorado. Later she taught violin and chamber music at the Pine Spring Ranch School of Music, where she was coach and violinist in the Paetsch - Fodor Chamber Music Ensemble in Steamboat Springs, CO. Extremely gifted young musicians such as John Fodor and his brother Eugene Fodor, outstanding in their ability and accomplishment, studied during the summers at the Paetsch Music camp at Pines Spring Ranch in Steamboat Springs, CO where they had private instruction and study as a string ensemble and learn music theory from Mr. and Mrs. Paetsch. Compositions Priscilla Paetsch was first violinist with the Colorado Springs Symphony and a recognized composer. Her compositions have been performed not only in Colorado Springs, but in the Eastern United States, Europe and Russia where her symphony was acclaimed when she appeared there representing the U.S. as judge of the International Stringed Instrument Competitions Priscilla's compositions include: * Symphony No. 1 * String Quartets * String Trio * Sonata for Violin and Piano * Rondo for Violin and Piano * Caprice for Solo Violin In 1978 she was awarded \\"Best Violin Teacher of the Year\\" by the American String Teachers Association (ASTA). Horses Paetsch Family on their Arabian Horses in Colorado Springs A member of the Arabian Horse Registry of American, Priscilla Paetsch raised, bred and trained Polish-bred registered Arabian horses. She used to jump her Arabian horses in competition winning many prizes. She shoes her own horses on the small plot of land her family owns on the west side of Colorado Springs. She taught all of her 7 children to be able to ride horses before they could walk. The family would ride for pleasure behind their house which, was the Rocky Mountain National Park. At one time she had 11 purebred Arabian horses at their house in Colorado Springs. She was ahead of the times, and as many people were schooled in a very formal environment where it was only proper to call the elders by the last names, she wanted to be called Priscilla.

It is not possible for a modular graph to contain a cycle of odd length. For, if is a shortest odd cycle in a graph, is a vertex of , and is the edge of the cycle farthest from , there could be no median , for the only vertices on the shortest path are and themselves, but neither can belong to a shortest path from to the other without shortcutting and creating a shorter odd cycle.

However, the modular graphs also include other graphs such as the complete bipartite graphs where the medians are not unique: when the three vertices , , and all belong to one side of the bipartition of a complete bipartite graph, every vertex on the other side is a median.

He owned Strandm√∏llen north of Copenhagen. Early life and education Srewsen was born at Strandm√∏llen, the son of paper manufacturer Christian Drewsen (1745-1810). His paternal family had come to Denmark from Hanover where they had been involved in manufacturing paper since 1692. Prominent cultural figures such as Knud Lyne Rahbek and Adam Oehlenschl√§ger were frequent visitors to the home. The writer and translator Hans Guldberg Sveistrup was a house teacher. His friend, Conrad Malte-Brun, sought refuge at Strandm√∏llen when he had the flee the country in 1793. Drewsen was apprenticed to his father but was struck by the new ideas of the time and the revolution and planned to become an army officer and go into French military service. He did, however, change his minds after falling in love with Johanne Ophelia Rosing, a daughter of the actor Michael Rosing. Farmer and agronomist When Drewsen was married in 1898, his father gave him the agricultural estate Smidstrup some ten kilometres north of Strandm√∏llen. By studying German literature on farming, and consulting the most successful farmers in the area, the pastors in Gentofte and Kongens Lyngby, and the brothers Jean and Fr√©d√©ric de Coninck at Frederikslund, he acquired a great knowledge about farming. He introduced new technology (such as the Scottish plough) as well as new practices (such as crop rotation) and crops (large-scale cultivation of potatoes). He became a member of the Royal Danish Society for Agriculture (Det Kongelige Danske Landhusholdningsselskab) in 1812 where he became the editor and writer of several publications on farming. He received the society's silver medal for a work on crop rotation in 1813 and its gold medal for a work on cultivation of clover. He also published a nine-volume translation of Albrecht Thaer's works on agronomy (Grunds√¶tninger for Land√∏konomien I-IV, 1816‚Äì19). From 1819 to 1930, he served as one of the society's three presidents. Together with Jonas Collin, he was the founder of the Agricultural Society for Copenahgen County (Agerdyrkningsselskabet for K√∏benhavns Amt) in 1818 (closed 1824). In 1819, he went on a study trip to Germany. Rogether with Fr√©d√©ric de Coninck and pastor R√∏nne, he was the publisher of the journal Land√∏konomiske Tidender (I-VII, 1815‚Äì17), which he later continued alone (VIII-IX, 1818‚Äì19; Nye land√∏konomiske Tidender I-IV, 1819‚Äì25). His most important work on agronomy, Betragtninger, was published in 1834 (2. oplag 1842). In 1841 and 1842 he published some minor works on breeding of silk worms and cultication of mulberry trees. He was involved in a controversy with professor Oluf Christian Olufsen. The paper mill Drewsen inherited Strandm√∏llen in 1810. It developed into the largest paper mill in the country after he modernized it with the introduction of steam engines and a hydraulic press. A major expansion took place in 1830. Drewsen had a monopoly on delivery of paper to the state as well as to the National Bank and completely dominated the market for paper used for printing. In 1844, the company was ceded to his sons Christian and Michael Drewsen. Politics In 1834, he became a member of Roskilde St√¶nderforsamling and soon became a leading figure in the fight for better conditions for peasants. In the 1840s, he supported the liberal movement as well as the Danish movement in S√∏nderjylland. In 1846 he was one of the founders of Bondevennernes Selskab and became a member of its board but broke with it in 1848 when it left the liberal movement. In 1835, he was a co-founder of the Society for the Proper Use of the Freedom of the Press (Selskabet for Trykkefrihedens rette Brug). He was a member of Folketinget in 1849-1850. Personal life Drewsen shared his times between Strandm√∏llen and an apartment in Copenhagen. In 1799-1804, it was located at Vestergade 32 (demolished). In 1807-1811, it was located at Knabrostr√¶de 12. In 1844, it was located at Ny Kongensgade 8. In 1845-1849, it was located at Kronprinsensgade 8. In 1850-1851, it was located at Store Kongensgade 62. Written works * Drewsen, J.

Rolfe (January 16, 1895 ‚Äì January 29, 1985) was a career officer in the United States Army. He attained the rank of brigadier general during World War II as commander of the Mountain Training Center at Camp Hale, Colorado, and the 71st Infantry Division. Rolfe graduated from West Point shortly before U.S. involvement in World War I. He served in combat with the 7th Infantry Regiment, and received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism and the Purple Heart for wounds suffered in a gas attack. Between World Wars I and II, Rolfe carried out a variety of assignments with increasing rank and responsibility, including professor of military science at Rutgers University, and senior observer and advisor for the Wisconsin National Guard. He also graduated from the Command and General Staff College and the Field Artillery Officer Course, after which he served as senior Infantry instructor at the Fort Sill Field Artillery School. During World War II, Rolfe specialized in winter operations and mountain warfare; he commanded 1st Battalion, 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, then advanced to command of the regiment. After promotion to brigadier general, he commanded the Camp Hale, Colorado Mountain Training Center, where he oversaw organization and training of the 10th Light Division (Alpine). Near the end of World War II, Rolfe went to France as deputy commander of the 71st Infantry Division, and took part in the Rhineland campaign and the Western Allied invasion of Germany. Rolfe performed post-war occupation duty in Austria, and commanded Land Area Salzburg and the 71st Infantry Division. After World War II, Rolfe was chief of the development section in the research and development office at Headquarters, Army Field Forces. During the Korean War, he commanded the Japan Logistics Command's Northern Command Area, and then Headquarters and Service Command, Far East Command. After his 1954 retirement, Rolfe resided in Winter Park, Florida. He died there on January 29, 1985, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Early life Onslow Sherburne Rolfe was born in Concord, New Hampshire on January 16, 1895. His father was Army Colonel Robert H. Rolfe, and his mother was Grace Stearns, the daughter of New Hampshire Governor Onslow Stearns. Rolfe attended schools in several states, Cuba, and Japan while his family moved for his father's military postings. He completed high school at St. Luke's Episcopal School in Wayne, Pennsylvania, and then attended Columbia Preparatory School in Washington, DC in anticipation of applying for admission to the United States Military Academy. Start of career Rolfe was admitted to West Point in 1914; his classmates nicknamed him \\"Pinkey\\" because of his red hair and flushed complexion, and the nickname stuck with him for the rest of his career. He graduated in August 1917, ranked 109th of 151 students. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant of Infantry, and was assigned to the 7th Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to first lieutenant on August 30. In October 1917 Rolfe joined his regiment in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. In late October and November, he attended the Infantry School of Arms at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He then joined his regiment at Camp Greene, North Carolina, and took part in pre-deployment training prior to going overseas. The regiment departed for France in March 1918. World War I After arriving in France the regiment took part in combat operations as part of the 3rd Division. Rolfe was a participant in the Second Battle of the Marne in July and August 1918, and received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism while moving and positioning 3rd Division reinforcements during a critical juncture in the battle. He was promoted to captain in September 1918, and took part in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Rolfe was wounded as the result of a gas attack in October, for which he received the Purple Heart. He convalesced at a hospital in France until January 1919. Post-World War I Rolfe's post-war assignments included the 131st Military Police Battalion (Fort Dix, New Jersey), 3rd Division Demobilization Group (Camp Pike, Arkansas), and Machine Gun Company, 4th Infantry Regiment (Fort Benning, Georgia). In the 1920s and 1930s, Rolfe's assignments included postings with the 4th, 18th, and 27th Infantry Regiments. In addition, he was professor of military science at Rutgers University, and senior observer and advisor for the Wisconsin National Guard. Rolfe graduated from the Command and General Staff College in 1936, and then completed the Field Artillery Officer Course, after which he was assigned as senior Infantry instructor at the Fort Sill Field Artillery School. World War II At the start of World War II the Army began to create and field units of light Infantry troops designed to operate in cold weather and at high altitudes. Rolfe was assigned to command 1st Battalion, 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment. His success at organizing this battalion and leading it during its initial training led to assignment as commander of the regiment and promotion to colonel. Unknown Army planners apparently thought assigning Rolfe to command a unit that would train to use skis and snowshoes was logical, because he had been born in New Hampshire; they were apparently unaware that he had left the state at six years old and had virtually no experience in winter sports. Despite his unfamiliarity with skiing and snowshoeing, Rolfe soon became proficient, and ensured that the soldiers in his regiment did likewise. From 1942 to 1945 Rolfe commanded the Camp Hale, Colorado Mountain Training Center, and received promotion to brigadier general. During his command of Camp Hale, the 85th, 86th, and 87th Mountain Infantry Regiments were organized as the 10th Light Division (Alpine), and Rolfe was responsible for ensuring that the division had the facilities and equipment necessary to complete its training, to include ski slopes, cliffs for rappelling, skis, and winter camouflage uniforms. Rolfe joined the 71st Infantry Division as assistant division commander in January 1945. The division took part in the Rhineland campaign and the Western Allied invasion of Germany. The 71st Division participated in the liberation of several concentration camps, including one in Austria called Gunskirchen Lager, a subcamp of the Mauthausen-Gusen facility. The 71st Division advanced further east than any other Allied unit, and made contact with Soviet forces near Linz on May 8, 1945. Post-World War II The 71st Division carried out occupation duties in Austria after hostilities ceased, and Rolfe commanded Land Area Salzburg. From August 17 to October 10, 1945 Rolfe was commander of the 71st Infantry Division. Rolfe returned to the United States in 1947 and was assigned as chief of the development section in the research and development office at Headquarters, Army Field Forces. Korean War In 1952, Rolfe was assigned as commander of the Japan Logistics Command's Northern Command Area. From 1953 until his 1954 retirement, Rolfe served as commander of Headquarters and Service Command, Far East Command. Awards In addition to the Distinguished Service Cross and Purple Heart, Rolfe received the Legion of Merit for his service with the 71st Infantry Division, and the Distinguished Service Medal for his post-World War II service in Japan. =Distinguished Service Cross citation= The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Captain (Infantry) Onslow Sherburne Rolfe, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with 7th Infantry Regiment, 3d Division, A.E.F., near Fossoy, France, July 14‚Äì15, 1918.

After three years, McFillen moved to the NCAA Division I level as the next commissioner for the now-defunct conference, the Metro Conference. While at Metro Conference, McFillen faced many obstacles, such as trying to expand the \\"super conference\\". McFillen was the final commissioner for the conference when it dissolved in 1995. Two years after the falling-out of the Metro Conference, McFillen was hired to replace Ken B. Jones as the second commissioner for the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association, an NCAA Division II school. While his time as commissioner, McFillen first was able to secure a contract to air five football games on KSMO-TV in the Kansas City area in 1997. All games were on Thursday nights. Other accomplishments during McFillen's term as commissioner were an addition of two schools ‚Äì Fort Hays State University in 2006 and University of Nebraska Omaha in 2008. In 2007, after 10 years in the MIAA and 40-plus years in collegiate athletics, McFillen retired.

Description The tree typically grows to a height of up to and has tessellated red-brown to grey-brown persistent bark throughout. The dull grey-green adult leaves have a disjunct arrangement and a narrow lanceolate to lanceolate shape that is basally tapered. The thin discolorous leaves have a length of and a width of with obscure lateral veins. The terminal compound inflorescences occur in groups of seven per umbel on pedicels with a length of . The mature buds have an obovoid to pyriform shape with a length of and a width of with a rounded to conical and beaked operculum and white flowers. The species can flower as early as January but usually flowers between March and August. The fruits that appear after flowering are pedicellate with an urceolate to barrel shape. They are around in length and wide with a descending disc and three or four enclosed valves. The reddish brown seeds within the fruit have an ellipsoidal shape with a terminal wing and have a length of . Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanists Denis Carr and Stella Carr in 1987 as Eucalyptus clarksoniana, in their book Eucalyptus II - The rubber cuticle, and other studies of the Corymbosae. The type specimens were collected by J.R. Clarkson on the track between New Dixie and Killarney stations on Cape York. It was reclassified in 1995 as Corymbia clarksoniana by Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson in the journal Telopea. Corymbia clarksoniana is one of a group of five closely related species that are found in Queensland. The others are C. polycarpa, C. novoguinensis, C. plena and C. ligans. The specific epithet honours John Richard Clarkson (born 1950) who worked at the Queensland Herbarium as a technician. He graduated from the University of Queensland in 1977 and was transferred to Mareeba in far north Queensland. He is a prolific botanical collector, contributing many specimens that are new to science. Distribution and habitat The tree is endemic to eastern parts of Queensland and far northern parts of New South Wales. The medium-sized bloodwood is found on inland plains and part of grassy woodlands and forests communities growing in sand and sandy loam soils but can be found in skeletal soils on ridges and hill tops. Hill and Johnson described C. clarksoniana as endemic to Queensland but also recognised C. clarksoniana, C. dolichocarpa and C. maritima as distinct species with intermediate populations. They recorded C. dolichocarpa as occurring from Charters Towers in Queensland to near Narrabri in New South Wales and C. maritima from near-coastal areas from Cardwell to the Whitsundays.

The Ghaza or Ghazi thesis (from , ƒ°azƒÅ, \\"holy war,\\" or simply \\"raid\\") is a historical paradigm first formulated by Paul Wittek which has been used to interpret the nature of the Ottoman Empire during the earliest period of its history, the fourteenth century, and its subsequent history. The thesis addresses the question of how the Ottomans were able to expand from a small principality on the frontier of the Byzantine Empire into a centralized, intercontinental empire. According to the Ghaza thesis, the Ottomans accomplished this by attracting recruits to fight for them in the name of Islamic holy war against the non-believers. Such a warrior was known in Turkish as a ghazi, and thus this thesis sees the early Ottoman state as a \\"Ghazi State,\\" defined by an ideology of holy war. The Ghaza Thesis dominated early Ottoman historiography throughout much of the twentieth century before coming under increasing criticism beginning in the 1980s. Historians now generally reject the Ghaza Thesis, and consequently the idea that Ottoman expansion was primarily fueled by holy war, but disagree about what hypothesis to replace it. Formation of the Ghaza thesis The Ghaza thesis was first formulated in the 1930s by Turkish historian Fuat K√∂pr√ºl√º and Austrian historian Paul Wittek. Partly in response to contemporary Orientalist historians, who tried to marginalize the role of the Turks in Ottoman state formation, K√∂pr√ºl√º formulated what was to become the Turkish nationalist view of early Ottoman history. According to K√∂pr√ºl√º, the Ottoman polity was formed by Turkish tribes fleeing the advance of the Mongol Empire, built upon Turkish tribal manpower, and administered by men from the Anatolian hinterland experienced in the Turco-Muslim political tradition of the Seljuks. Paul Wittek, responding to K√∂pr√ºl√º's claims, accepted the Turco-Muslim basis of the early Ottoman state, agreeing that it grew out of the already highly developed civilization of Seljuk Anatolia and was fundamentally shaped by the unique conditions of the Byzantine frontier. Yet rather than Turkish ethnicity and tribal connections, he placed his primary emphasis upon the role of Islam. For Wittek, the Ottomans were first and foremost Islamic holy warriors. His primary evidence for this included the titles adopted by early Ottoman rulers, including an inscription erected in Bursa in 1337 describing Orhan, the second Ottoman ruler, as \\"ghazi, son of ghazi.\\" Wittek also relied upon the work of the early fifteenth-century Ottoman poet Ahmedi, who likewise described the early Ottoman rulers as ghazis. Thus in this formulation, the early Ottoman polity was built upon an \\"ideology of Holy War,\\" and was able to grow powerful by attracting warriors to join in conquering the Christians of Anatolia and the Balkans. The early Ottomans harnessed the religious and martial energies of the frontier (uc) between the crumbling Byzantine and Seljuk states in order to conquer an empire.For this summary of their views, For these authors' works see ; and It was Wittek's formulation which became generally (though not unanimously) accepted among Western historians of the Ottoman Empire for much of the twentieth century. Revisionism The fundamental problem with the study of the fourteenth-century Ottomans is the lack of surviving documentation from that time period. Not a single Ottoman authentic written document has been found from the time of Osman I, the first Ottoman ruler. Historians are thus forced to rely upon sources produced long after the events they purport to describe. Ottoman studies have thus benefited from the techniques of literary criticism, allowing historians to properly analyze Ottoman literary works from later periods. The Ghaza thesis came under attack from numerous scholars beginning in the 1980s. Critics drew attention to the fact that the early Ottomans acted in ways contrary to what one would expect from zealous religious warriors. They were not strictly orthodox Muslims, but rather tolerated many heterodox and syncretic beliefs and practices. They also willingly recruited Byzantines into their ranks and fought wars against other Muslims. Thus rather than describing reality, later Ottoman writers who characterized their ancestors as ghazis were \\"adorning [them] with higher ideals,\\" when in fact their original motivations had been much more mundane. For Ottomans writing in the fifteenth century, presenting the earlier Ottoman rulers as ghazis served their political objectives. In emphasizing the mythical and legendary quality of the stories presented by Ottoman writers, the historian Colin Imber has gone so far as to declare the entire period a \\"black hole,\\" the truth about which can never truly be known. =The Ottomans as a tribal group= While many scholars criticized the Ghaza thesis, few sought an alternative to replace it. Rudi Paul Lindner was the first to try in his 1983 publication Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia, in which he argued that the peculiarities of early Ottoman activity could best be explained through tribalism. Lindner saw tribalism through the lens of anthropology, which views tribes as organizations based not on shared bloodlines, but on shared political interests. Early Ottoman raids against the Byzantines were motivated not by religious zeal, but by the nomadic tribe's need to engage in predation against settled society. The Ottomans were able to incorporate Byzantines and fight against Muslims because their organization was fundamentally tribal, which allowed them to assimilate individuals and groups of diverse backgrounds. Citing various instances of their heterodoxy, Lindner even suggested that the early Ottomans may have been more Pagan than Muslim. In Lindner's view, this tribal inclusiveness began to break down during the reign of Osman's son Orhan (r. 1323/4-1362), as the Ottomans began to shift from being nomadic pastoralists into settled agricultural society. Orhan subsequently attracted Islamic scholars to his realm, who brought with them ideas about ghaza, and it was from them that he adopted the ghaza ideology in time for it to appear in his 1337 inscription in Bursa. =Ghaza as one of many factors= In his 1995 book Between Two Worlds: The Construction of the Ottoman State, Turkish scholar Cemal Kafadar addressed criticism of the Ghaza thesis by arguing that previous scholars had drawn too great a distinction between \\"orthodox\\" and \\"heterodox\\" Islam ‚Äì one could consider oneself a legitimate Muslim without conforming exactly to a scholarly orthodoxy. Furthermore, Kafadar argued that the early Ottomans' very idea of ghaza may have differed from that of \\"orthodox\\" Islam. Citing contemporary Anatolian legends, he noted that the same figure could be portrayed as a ghazi while still cooperating with Christians. In Kafadar's view, ghaza was a real ideology which gave shape to frontier warriors as a social class, not simply an import from Muslim scholars. However, the terms ghaza and ghazi had a range of different meanings which shifted over time, sometimes referring to religiously motivated warriors and sometimes not. It was nevertheless ever present, and served as simply one out of many motivating forces behind Ottoman expansion. =Ghaza as a non-religious term= Following Kafadar, the next major reformulation of the theory of Ottoman origins was carried out by Heath Lowry in 2003. Lowry attacked Wittek's sources, arguing that Ahmedi's literary work cannot be interpreted as factual history, but rather was a fictionalized idealization of the past. According to Lowry, the terms ghaza and ghazi when used in the fourteenth and fifteenth-century Ottoman context had entirely non- religious meanings, as ghaza was interchangeable with the term akƒ±n, simply referring to a military raid. Many akƒ±ncƒ±s (raiders) were also Christians, and would thus be very out of place in an army devoted to Islamic holy war. Ottoman warriors were thus motivated by the desire to win plunder and slaves, not to fight in the name of Islam. It was only certain writers, educated in the Islamic tradition, who tried to draw a connection between the secular ghaza of the frontier warriors and the religious ghaza as understood by Muslim intellectuals. New consensus While they differ in many particulars, these new perspectives on early Ottoman history share in the belief that early Ottoman expansion was not primarily fueled by an ideology of Islamic holy war. Historians now generally regard ghaza as having been \\"a much more fluid undertaking, sometimes referring to actions that were nothing more than raids, sometimes meaning a deliberate holy war, but most often combining a mixture of these elements.\\" This view also appears in Caroline Finkel's 2005 scholarly survey of Ottoman history, Osman's Dream.

However, as equilin, with equilin sulfate being a major component of CEEs, is transformed into 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin in the body, analogously to the conversion of estrone into estradiol, 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin is, along with estradiol, the most important estrogen responsible for the effects of CEEs. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= 17Œ≤-Dihydroequilin is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs), the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤. In terms of relative binding affinity for the ERs, 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin has about 113% and 108% of that of estradiol for the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively. 17Œ≤-Dihydroequilin has about 83% of the relative potency of CEEs in the vagina and 200% of the relative potency of CEEs in the uterus. Of the equine estrogens, it shows the highest estrogenic activity and greatest estrogenic potency. Like CEEs as a whole, 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin has disproportionate effects in certain tissues such as the liver and uterus. Equilin, the second major component of conjugated estrogens after estrone, is reversibly transformed into 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin analogously to the transformation of estrone into estradiol. However, whereas the balance of mutual interconversion of estrone and estradiol is largely shifted in the direction of estrone, it is nearly equal in the case of equilin and 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin. As such, although 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin is only a minor constituent of CEEs, it is, along with estradiol, the most important estrogen relevant to the estrogenic activity of the medication. =Pharmacokinetics= 17Œ≤-Dihydroequilin has about 30% of the relative binding affinity of testosterone for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), relative to 50% for estradiol. The metabolic clearance rate of 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin is 1,250 L/day/m2, relative to 580 L/day/m2 for estradiol.

The church was dedicated in 1883. For over one hundred years, the church was the tallest building in Maine. The building is also known for its stained-glass windows, organ, art, and size. The church also had its own school, St. Joseph's School.

She was created by William Kotzwinkle and Brian Helgeland. She appears as a main character in two of the nine A Nightmare on Elm Street films, first appearing in Renny Harlin's A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988). In 1989, Alice returned in Stephen Hopkins' A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child before going on to appear in the comic book adaptions, novels, and Freddy vs. Jason (2003) through archive footage. In The Dream Master, Alice has the ability to gain the \\"dream powers\\" of Freddy Krueger's victims and takes over the protagonist role after Kristen Parker is murdered by Freddy. In The Dream Child, Freddy begins to use Alice's unborn son Jacob as a way to return.  Appearances  = Film = In A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, Alice Johnson was the best friend of Kristen Parker. Their friendship was further solidified due to Alice's brother Rick dating Kristen. Alice and Rick came from a broken family. Their mother had long died before the events of the film, and the grief and devastation likely turned their father Dennis into an alcoholic. Whereas Rick showed gregariousness to mask his emotional pain, Alice became timid and withdrawn‚Äîto the point that she covered her dresser mirror with pictures just so she would not have to see her reflection. She worked as a waitress and daydreamed constantly to escape from the real world. When Kristen accidentally pulls Alice into her dream, Kristen passes on her dream powers before being killed by Freddy Krueger. Alice became the \\"Dream Master\\", described in the script as a mythical \\"ancient guardian of the gate of good dreams\\", due to the combination of Kristen's powers and her own latent dreaming abilities (e.g., shortly before Freddy's final attack on Kristen, Alice appears in Kristen's dream as a child playing on a beach). Alice then became Freddy's next target because, by killing Kristen, he could no longer access new victims. Alice was Freddy's loophole, as he could kill anyone that she uncontrollably pulled into her dreams. Her link to Freddy allowed her to take on the abilities‚Äî both from the waking world and the dream world‚Äîof his victims. As Alice's friends and brother are picked off by Freddy, she grows much stronger and capable of fighting back through the abilities that she accumulates. Sensing that Freddy relied on his victim's souls, Alice manages to defeat him by giving all of his victims the power to escape Freddy's body and enter the positive dream gate. In A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child, Alice suppressed her encounter with Freddy by starting a relationship with Dan Jordan (the other survivor from The Dream Master) and making new friends. However, after becoming pregnant by Dan, Alice begins having nightmares about Freddy that reflect the horror surrounding his conception and birth. Alice's friends and Dan are soon murdered, and it is revealed that Freddy is planning to be reborn in the body of her unborn son Jacob Daniel Johnson. He is corrupting Jacob by feeding him the souls of the victims. Due to her pregnancy, Alice shares her \\"Dream Master\\" abilities with Jacob. There is a caveat, however, as Jacob is able to blur the boundary between the waking world and the dream world without Alice needing to be asleep. Thereby, just like his mother in the previous film, Jacob becomes a prime target for manipulation due to not having the right control over his abilities. When Alice is on the verge of losing her battle against Freddy, Sister Mary Helena (Amanda Krueger) urges Jacob to beat Freddy with the souls that were fed to him. Upon Freddy's demise, Alice gives birth to Jacob several months later. In the original script for Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, Alice was set to return. She would have been killed by Freddy early in the film, making Jacob the main protagonist. However, this version of the script was scrapped and the actual film makes no mention of Alice or Jacob, and leaves their fates ambiguous. Lisa Wilcox has since confirmed that the producers never made any attempt to call her back for the sixth Elm Street film, although they did contact her about allowing footage of Alice to appear during the end credits. Footage of Alice also appears in flashbacks during Freddy's introduction in Freddy vs. Jason (2003). = Literature = Alice in Nightmares on Elm Street (1991) and Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors (2009) Alice is the one of the main protagonists of Innovation Publishing's 1991 Nightmares on Elm Street comics. In this comic book series, Alice returns to Springwood following the death of her father and is forced to face Freddy after he again tries to use Jacob to kill for him. In the end, Neil Gordon gives up his body so that he can join Nancy Thompson in the \\"Beautiful Dream.\\" Dan's spirit occupies Neil's body, and he is reunited with Alice and Jacob.Nightmares on Elm Street #3-6 (1991)  * She also appears in Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: Nightmare Warriors where a vision of Freddy causes her to meet with other Freddy and Jason survivors. As with The Dream Child, Alice and Jacob are partly linked regarding the \\"Dream Master\\" abilities. For instance, a sleeping Jacob has the ability to call an awake Alice. In turn, Alice can physically enter Jacob's dream and wake up in the place that he fell asleep. Alice's dream powers come at a cost, as she has been suffering from a terminal illness. She later sacrifices herself to pass her full powers onto Jacob. In the anthology book The Nightmares on Elm Street: Freddy Krueger's Seven Sweetest Dreams (1991), Alice appears in Philip Nutman's short story \\"Dead Highway, Lost Roads\\". Years after the events of Dream Child, Alice is now married to a real estate developer named Steve Segel. Although they've settled into a normal domestic routine, there's still cracks in their marriage ‚Äî Alice is secretive about her Dream Master abilities and Steve feels like he's competing with his wife's late high school sweetheart Dan Jordan. Alice cannot shake her frightful encounters with Freddy, and she even insists (much to Steve's chagrin) on living near a shopping mall complex that has been built over 1428 Elm Street to secretly keep watch. While driving to visit her father Dennis at a rehabilitation clinic, Alice is involved in a major car pileup. Freddy manipulates the lucid dream abilities of serial killer Karl Stolenberg (who was involved in the accident while en route to his execution) in order to ensnare Alice in the \\"dead highway\\". Alice searches for a means of escape while Freddy prepares an \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" tableau in anticipation of their reunion. Six-year-old Jacob‚Äîwho is staying in Wisconsin with Yvonne‚Äîenters the dreamworld upon sensing Alice's peril, and enlists the aid of Karl and anthropomorphic armadillo Joe Bob to find his mother. Near the conclusion, a deranged Karl attacks Alice, but is returned to his senses by Jacob through physical force. Alice and Karl cooperate to defeat Freddy, though Karl perishes in the battle. With Freddy defeated, Alice and Jacob return to the waking world. Alice is also mentioned in the short story \\"Le Morte De Freddy\\" by William Relling Jr. Inbetween the events of The Dream Master and The Dream Child, Alice sent a letter to Dr. Neil Gordon (now living in Gainesville, Florida) that Kristen Parker, Roland Kincaid and Joey Crusel were murdered by Freddy, but that she took care of him. With Freddy now terrorizing a new batch of adolescent psychiatric patients, Dr. Gordon teams up with another psychiatrist to stop Freddy for good. Alice, whose whereabouts are unspecified, is not involved in their plan. She is mentioned by Freddy, alongside with Nancy and Kristen, when he accuses them of hating their neglectful parents, claiming that it was their hate and not their fear that allowed him to get into their dreams. Her son Jacob is the main protagonist in Natasha Rhodes' novel A Nightmare on Elm Street: Perchance to Dream. The book mentions that his grandmother Doris Jordan stole custody from Alice when Jacob was born, though he eventually entered the foster system. Alice went missing shortly after an adolescent Jacob was institutionalized at Westin Hills for killing his foster parents (who he was hallucinating as being Freddy). It is revealed that anyone who is aware of Freddy's existence is quarantined in the institution. Upon escaping from the mental hospital, Jacob sees a vision of her when he passes by his childhood home. Near the end, he sees another vision of his mother suffering unresponsively in the dream world, supposedly killed by Freddy; it is not clarified in the novel whether Jacob's vision of Alice is truly her or just an apparition conjured up by Freddy to torment him. Even though Alice is absent, Jacob has stopped himself and others from dreaming for a month by using his dream powers to protect everyone from Freddy. = In fan films = Although not considered a part of the official film canon, Alice (played by Taylor Burskey) has a cameo in Don't Fall Asleep: The Film (2016; Produced by 3 Count & Go): Taking place between A Nightmare on Elm Street and A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Nancy Thompson (played by Diandra Lazor) is struggling to maintain her sanity after she is checked into a psychiatric ward. In the film, Alice's mother is an exhausted nurse that works at the ward. Alice (played by Kay Leahy) is set to appear as one of the main female protagonists in Freddy vs. Jason: Dreamscape (2020), written by Joshua Adams and executive produced by noted horror author Blake Best.  Reception  Monika Bartyzel stated that Alice is different when compared to other final girls and that her empowerment over the course of the films became an essential plot point, she said: : At first, she‚Äôs the shy, introverted hanger-on to her much more wild friends (much like Laurie Strode). She considers herself a non-entity, preferring to mask her mirror, and thereby herself, with her friends‚Äô images. When they die, however, and she mystically consumes portions of their strength, the pictures come down in chunks as she wipes away the old Alice to become the active fighter. Instead of teamwork, the team is infused into one previously passive being, a mecha-human designed to defeat the dream monster. Alice is one of the few true and ongoing Final Girls; she survives two films, saves her child from demonic possession, and disappears from the Nightmare on Elm Street world without ever succumbing to the inevitability of death in a future installment. Other A Nightmare on Elm Street fans have also highlighted Alice's \\"inner journey\\" as the primary aspect that makes her stand out among horror protagonists, with Patti Pauley writing that \\"Alice Johnson‚Äôs journey towards her end-game battle with Freddy is unique among her ‚Äô80s horror movie peers\\" and (in contrast with Nancy Thompson) \\"Nancy from the get-go was clearly a strong-minded individual, whereas Alice had to go through some rough shit to get herself there\\". On the horror blog Horror and Sons, Cody Mascho similarly comments that \\"One of the biggest reasons I love Alice is how she‚Äôs built up over both movies. She undergoes an amazing and relatable character journey, which really allows the viewer to root for and sympathize with her\\". Joshua Anderson has written that Alice's character arc of evolving from shy and introverted to headstrong and extroverted helped him with coming to terms with his own homosexuality while growing up. Brennan Klein on Dread Central calls Alice's character arc \\"the most powerful in the franchise\\", adding that \\"in between the cockroach weight lifting and the time loops and the movie theater vortex is a genuinely powerful story of a young woman‚Äôs self-actualization in the face of trauma\\" and that initially she is \\"so bland and boring that you might even start to wonder why the movie even decided to have her as the protagonist\\". The website Lady Geek Girl and Friends praised the intelligence and strength of the character saying, \\"Letting go of the past, suiting up for battle with the accoutrements of her fallen friends, and finally looking at herself in the mirror and being damn pleased with what she sees, ugh, it‚Äôs one of the best sequences in the series. In the ensuing battle we see just how powerful Alice really is as she is the first heroine in the series to face Freddy in the dream, alone, and triumph. The fight takes her to the limits of what she can do, and everything she‚Äôs gained from her friends helps, but in the end it‚Äôs her own intelligence that defeats the monster.\\" Similarly, Tommy Watanabe praised the strength of the character, saying: :In the fifth installment of the franchise, Alice fights to protect her unborn child from the possession of Freddy's spirit using more of her abilities, even invading the nightmare of her new bestie (wow, Alice, you move on quick) Yvonne by spearing Freddy with a pipe as he tries to kill Yvonne. Capable and creative, Alice proves to be a strong woman readily available to protect her friends (or attempt to, in the case of comic book artist Mark and aspiring model Greta) and family at any cost. More importantly, she had sex... and survived! Alice was ranked 12th on BuzzFeed's top 25 list of final girls, the 7th on ComingSoon.net 11th on Paste Magazine's list \\"The 20 Best \\"Final Girls\\" in Horror Movie History\\" and one of \\"8 Badass Female Characters in Horror Films\\". On Cinapse, Ashlee Blackwell writes that \\"far from your mass-produced horror maiden serving only one purpose, Alice is multi-dimensional\\" and that she is \\"representative of a woman as ‚Äòhuman, normal‚Äô and whole in what has been said to be the most sexist of film genres next to pornography. Alice was not simply the shy girl who never gets the guy; the buxom, sexually promiscuous fatale, or even just the capable ‚Äòfinal girl‚Äô who defeats the killer. She is a naturally progressing variation of many of those traits and more, wrapped in one character in one film.\\"  Development  = Conception = In The Dream Master scripts written by William Kotzwinkle, Brian Helgeland, Jim Wheat, and Ken Wheat, Alice still begins as a shy and introverted individual. A marked difference is that Kristen and Alice have a closer friendship. In the script, before learning about the deaths of Kincaid and Joey, Kristen confides in Alice that she has the ability to pull others into her dreams. When the group explores 1428 Elm Street, a still mystified Alice foreshadows her bravery by volunteering to be pulled into Kristen's dream if the need should arise. Alice asserts herself earlier in the film, describing the supernatural circumstances surrounding Kristen's death to the group. She tells her brother Rick about her newfound abilities, and he plays an active role in trying to keep her awake until he himself is killed. While Alice still has a final showdown with Freddy, she undergoes a physical transformation during the dresser mirror scene in which her body becomes leaner, muscular and adorned with supernatural accouterments. In the script, it is elaborated that \\"She's quite beautiful now, and there's a surety and strength in her eyes\\" (after Rick's death), and at the end scene: \\"Alice is far from what she looked like in the film's beginning. She radiates an earthy sensuousness and an inner strength.\\" According to Andras Jones who played Alice's brother Rick, the two were twins in at least one draft of the script, explaining the two attending the same class in high school. Due to a writer's strike going on in 1988, Andras and Lisa wrote their own dialogue for the scene where they watched past home videos of themselves with Kristen and other friends while discussing Kristen's death. A deleted scene was filmed for The Dream Master in which Alice has a nightmare about her father supposedly being murdered by Freddy in their kitchen; some footage of Lisa Wilcox reacting to the scene can be seen in the documentary \\"The Making of A Nightmare on Elm Street 4\\". For the sequel to The Dream Master, the producer's brief to the scripwriters was \\"Alice is pregnant, Freddy wants the baby, Dan is the first to die\\". With regard to The Dream Child scripts, Alice still battles Freddy to save her unborn son. Depending upon the script, Alice goes from an active to a passive protagonist as the events unfold. The best example is in the first script draft. Upon Freddy's resurrection, a cornered Alice is ready to die before pulling in more victims for him to kill. Freddy makes his plans known quickly, as he is the one that informs Alice that she is pregnant. Dan also learns that Alice is pregnant, unlike the film where Freddy kills him before the revelation. Alice has made new friends, and her past encounters with Freddy are no secret to them. Her straightforward efforts to prepare them for Freddy's onslaught fall short, however. With each murder, Alice still absorbs the souls through her womb but the script specifies that her gestation period is hastened. Alice accumulates her knowledge through help from Jacob (named Jason in the script) who introduces her to a book about dreams. By studying the book, Alice learns how to enter Freddy's mind through the \\"dream pool\\" and communicate with Sister Mary Helena (Amanda Krueger). As Freddy advances on Alice, her sonogram shows twins as Freddy's evil fetus is depleting Jacob in a parasitic symbiosis. Due to a warped pregnancy making her physically incapacitated, Alice is unable to fight back against Freddy's machinations. By the script's conclusion, the parasitic Freddy baby leaves Alice's body because of Sister Mary Helena's interference and Jacob is delivered instead. As opposed to the film, the first draft of The Dream Child shows a greater rapport between Jacob and Alice as they research on how to defeat Freddy. Their relationship is further illustrated by Alice and Jacob experiencing the same physical deterioration as the plot unfolds. Yet, Alice does not know the true identity of Jacob until after she gives birth to him. So, in essence, the original plot detail differs from the film in that it impacts Alice's maternal motivation to save Jacob. In David Schow's treatment, Alice give birth to twins. During a 2019 interview, the interviewers pointed out that Alice was essentially the star of The Dream Child, with the producers having pushed Freddy a bit into the background compared to The Dream Master, and that removing Freddy from the story altogether would still have worked as a shorter soap opera-like teen pregnancy story. Lisa Wilcox felt that the gravity of teen pregnancy was absent from the earlier drafts, saying that :\\"the first few versions of the script completely ignored things like abortion and adoption, things that teenagers have to contemplate. Fortunately, the writers and producers realized that even though this is a horror film and a fantasy, teen pregnancy is an important issue that must be dealt with in a realistic manner. They added certain elements to the Alice character to explore the situation\\". One of the numerous alternate screenplays for Freddy vs Jason written by later Hellboy movie co-writer Peter Briggs in 1995 would have seen Alice teaming up with Friday the 13th protagonists Steven Freeman and Jessica Kimble from Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday in 1999, leading to their respective children Jacob and Stephanie being kidnapped by Jason Voorhees, whose mind Alice enters to discover that he was an Elm Street child and that his mother Pamela was one of the vigilante parents who burned the human Fred Krueger to death. She would also have dropped a hydraulically raised Pontiac car over the pursuing Jason in a garage. Freddy would have chased Alice and Jessica Kimble through Hell, only to be distracted by Thanos, Lord of the Underworld, allowing Alice and Jessica to escape with Jacob and Stephanie and survive. Briggs called Alice \\"obviously an extremely useful character on multiple levels\\" to his storytelling. The concept of survivors of the two franchises coalescing, alongside with the ending with a time-displaced character signing the botched search warrant for Freddy back in the 60's, would later be used as an inspiration for the aforementioned Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors comic book series according to former New Line Cinema executive Jeff Katz, who cites the Peter Briggs draft as his favorite. = Characterization = In an interview Lisa Wilcox described Alice as an outcast that a lot of people can relate to, she said: : ‚ÄúI immediately fell in love with the story of Alice, she‚Äôs a daydreamer who was kind of pathetic at the beginning of Part Four, and I think we all can relate to that feeling in some ways. Actually, I was totally a wallflower in high school so there was a lot of myself in the character of Alice. There‚Äôs a lot of Lisa on that screen.‚Äù Wilcox also mentioned the character development of Alice by stating that: : \\"As an actress, though, what made Alice remarkable is that audiences watch Alice become stronger and stronger as the movie plays along, and you can‚Äôt help but be a part of her journey because she‚Äôs so relatable.\\" Alice has reddish hair in The Dream Master, but has Lisa Wilcox's natural blond hair in the sequel. According to Wilcox, the producers wanted to differentiate Alice to Kristen since Tuesday Knight also had naturally light blond hair, as did Brooke Theiss (Debbie Stevens). Wilcox did not want to dye her hair with more permanent chemicals, but agreed to rinse it daily for the shootings. For Dream Child, the producers did not deem it necessary for Wilcox to color her hair again. In The Dream Master, Alice is portrayed as a regular daydreamer who wishes she would have the courage to ask her crush out, handsome jock Dan Jordan, and stand up to her alcoholic single father when he lashes out at her. Similar to fellow heroine Nancy Thompson's father Donald, Alice's father is an \\"alcoholic who is a parental failure\\" in Dream Master, and Alice thus resorts to \\"daydreaming as an escapist vehicle from a dysfunctional family\\". She describes her worst fear as being to have to work as a lowly waitress for the rest of her life, embodying \\"adolescent fears of entrapment in low-income service employment, a grim reality for most middle-class teenagers\\", and one that Freddy forces her to confront in her cinematic dream. A student refers to Alice as a \\"basket case\\" to Dan, who angrily rebukes him. She is portrayed as very shy and withdrawn at first, and her more outgoing brother Rick tries to cheer her up and teach her to stand up for herself. In the film, Alice's personal development is shown metaphorically through the mirror in her room, which at first she has loaded with photographs that she gradually removes for each one of her murdered friends. In his book Horror Films of the 1980s, John Kenneth Muir noted the following: :\\"Alice's blossoming is coupled with the mirror (an important symbol in the film). When she is weak and diffident, the mirror is loaded with photographs that obscure her reflection. The message is that she doesn't want to see herself; she'd rather hide from what she considers ugly. But as Alice's strength grows, she takes down the photos and countenances her own image. What she finds there is gorgeous and strong.\\" Muir believes that Alice's transformation \\"is the perfect counterpoint to Freddy's storyline.\\" Whereas Freddy's reflection encompasses evil, Alice's \\"reflection is what makes her powerful.\\" According to Muir, the character of Alice Johnson, goes against the \\"final girl\\" stereotype in that she is a \\"greasy-haired ugly duckling [who finds] her inner strength and beauty through self-actualization\\" adding that \\"from Nancy to Alice, the women on Elm Street are tough, resourceful, powerful role models for teenagers, ones who--mirror--reality in their efforts to navigate high school, and indeed life.\\" In the book Generation Multiplex: The Image of Youth in American Cinema after 1980, Timothy Shary describes the metaphorical quality of the storyline in part 5 and of Alice's \\"pro-life\\" choice, arguing that Alice's cargo as a young, now single mother might potentially have been a worse nightmare to many other teenage girls/young women than anything Freddy might have come up with: :\\"Alice, who's been impregnated by her slain boyfriend, realizes that Freddy plans to pose as a fetus growing inside her, but rather than abort the baby, thereby killing the possibility of spawning another monster, she adamantly declares her choice to keep it. In a less fanciful film this could be read as an ironic pro-life stance, but here Alice uses her capacity to give birth as her maternal defense against Freddy's patriarchal power. In a convoluted showdown, Alice violently pulls the diseased Freddy fetus out of her body, an image of monstrous birth and abortion, and this mutant then enters Freddy's mother, where he is finally re-contained in her womb. Alice retains her original \\"good\\" baby, and thus the result of her having sex is both death and life; the film's irony is that this teenager is faced with the challenge of raising a child alone, perhaps a more realistic nightmare for teen girls than any offered by Freddy.\\" On the subject, John Kenneth Muir adds that \\"the idea of abortion, the hottest of all hot button issues, is handled in a very casual, non-preachy fashion\\", summarizing that \\"[Alice is] afraid of what her child will be; she wants to protect it; and she has to fend off Dan's parents, who want to adopt the child... [she must deal] with all of these competing emotions and stresses, not to mention Freddy....\\" As Muir summarizes: :\\"[Alice is] afraid of what her child will be; she wants to protect it; and she has to fend off Dan's parents, who want to adopt the child...[she must deal] with all of these competing emotions and stresses, not to mention Freddy....\\" John Carl Buechler, director of Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) and who was also involved in the Dream Master creative team the very same year, has compared the character arc of Friday the 13th heroine Tina Shepard from said film with Alice's arc, pointing out that \\"both films are about heroines who take on special powers which they use to fight the monster. In The New Blood, Tina's able to fully harness her telekinetic powers by the end to defeat Jason which is what happened, more or less, in The Dream Master.\\" Notes See also *Final girl *Jacob Daniel Johnson *Nancy Thompson  References   External links  * Alice Johnson on IMDb * Alice Johnson at A Nightmare on Elm Street (wiki) * Alice Johnson at Heroes (wiki) * Alice Johnson at Horror Film (wiki) Category:A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise) characters Category:Fictional karateka Category:Fictional psychics Category:Fictional stalking victims Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional characters from Ohio Category:Film characters introduced in 1988 Category:Fictional characters with dream manipulation abilities Category:Fictional teenage parents Category:Teenage characters in film Category:Fictional sole survivors Category:Final girls ","title":"Alice Johnson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)"},{"id":"51809229","text":"Mario Gachet (15 August 1879 ‚Äì 18 February 1981) was an Italian painter, mainly depicting landscapes in his native Piedmont.

Before the abolition of slavery, he was an abolitionist and worked with his close relative, George DeBaptiste in the Underground Railroad, mainly in Detroit, Michigan. His ministry took him to Ohio, and in 1863, to Olivet Baptist Church in Chicago. He was a leader in the local and national Baptist community. He also was a journalist, serving as editor or correspondent to various newspapers and journals. Early life Richard DeBaptiste was born free in Fredericksburg, Virginia on November 11, 1831 to free people of color William and Eliza DeBaptiste.

A Century of Negro Migration, Courier Corporation, Feb 3, 2003. p28 There he continued his education under Richard Dillingham, a Quaker; and Reverend Samuel H. Davis, pastor of the Second Baptist Church of Detroit. His father and uncle were builders and general contractors, and Richard was trained in brick manufacturing, brick building, and plastering. In the west, his father worked in the grocery business, and Richard assisted. When this business failed, they resumed contracting work, with Richard as a partner. In Detroit and later in Ohio and Chicago, DeBaptiste worked to help fugitive slaves escape to Canada.

DeBaptiste married Georgiana Brische of Cincinnati, Ohio in October 1855. She was the daughter of James and Louisa Brischo. The couple lived in Detroit until 1858, when they moved to Mount Pleasant, Hamilton County, Ohio. They had three children together. Georgiana died November 2, 1872.

Lastly, he married Nellie Williams of Galesburg, Illinois on November 11, 1890. Chicago In Mount Pleasant, DeBaptiste was licensed to preach and organized a Sunday School. He also preached at the Union Baptist Church in Cincinnati. DeBaptiste was ordained in April 1860 at Mount Pleasant, Ohio by a council called by the Union Baptist Church of Cincinnati. It consisted of five Baptist churches in Cincinnati and Lockland, Ohio. In addition to conducting his ministry, he taught public schools for black children in Springfield Township and Mount Pleasant for three years. Also, he organized and was pastor at a black Baptist church there from 1860 to 1863. In August 1863, DeBaptiste was called to succeed Jesse Freeman Boulden as pastor of Olivet Baptist Church in Chicago. There he served nearly two decades until February 1882. James Alfred Dunn Podd was called to the office after him. During his service, DeBaptist baptized more than 1,700 people. He organized or planted several churches in Illinois, including the Second Baptist Church of Elgin, the Third Baptist Church of Aurora, the Baptist Church at St. Charles, and the Second Baptist Church of Evanston. Also in Chicago, he attended lectures for two years at the Morgan Park Theological Seminary, a part of the University of Chicago. In 1869, he organized Illinois' first Colored Convention to fight for black civil rights.Brunson III, James E.

McFarland, 2009. p28 DeBaptiste held numerous leadership positions in local and national Baptist organizations. He was elected corresponding secretary of the Wood River Association, serving from 1856 to 1887. He was elected recording secretary of the Northwestern and Southern Baptist convention in 1865 in St. Louis, Missouri. At the 1866 annual meeting, he was elected corresponding secretary. He was elected president of the consolidated American Baptist Missionary convention in Nashville, Tennessee in 1867 and reelected for the following four years, including in 1870 at Wilmington, North Carolina, although he did not attend. In 1870, he was elected president of the Baptist Free Mission Society, a white organization, at their meeting in Cincinnati. Also in 1870, he was elected corresponding secretary of the American Baptist National Convention, which met August 25‚Äì29 in St. Louis.

At the 1877 meeting at Richmond, Virginia, DeBaptiste was elected corresponding secretary of the Foreign Mission department, a position he held for two years. About this time, DeBaptiste also served as a trustee at Leland University. In 1881, he was elected corresponding secretary of the Baptist General Association of the Western States and Territories, and also held the position of treasurer of that group. In 1886 and 1887 he was elected corresponding secretary of the American National Baptist Convention, and elected convention statistician at numerous later conventions. In his various positions, DeBaptiste worked for integration and black rights and called for the condemnation of \\"black laws\\". His efforts contributed to the repeal of black laws in Illinois. In 1886, DeBaptiste was a leader at the American National Baptist Convention called by William J. Simmons. A major issue facing the group was unifying black Baptists.

He is formally recognised as a Notable GraduateMichael Agostino, The Australian National University School of Art: A history of the first 65 Years (Canberra, ANU, 2009), p. 243. from the Graphic Investigation Workshop, Australian National University (ANU), alongside Alex Hamilton, Paul McDermott, Danie Mellor and Paul Uhlmann. Day's body of work comprises prints, artist's books, drawings and watercolours. Various institutions have collected his work, including the National Gallery of Australia, National Library of Australia, State Library of New South Wales, State Library of Queensland, State Library of Victoria, and the Baillieu Library (Melbourne University).  Life Day, a lineal descendant of Wong Ah Sat, was born in Goulburn, New South Wales, living in the same house for his entire childhood and adolescent years. At age 16, he briefly trained as a graphic designer at the NSW Police Academy. Rather than pursue graphic design as a career, Day enrolled at the local technical college to study art. In 1992, he moved to Canberra to study at the Canberra School of Art, ANU (graduating with a Bachelor of Art with First Class Honours). While still a student, he worked as an illustrator and caricaturist at The Canberra Times.Example illustration by Day for the Canberra Times. 1995 He abandoned this path in 1996, choosing instead to work as a printer, binder, and designer of books for the Edition + Artist's Book Studio, ANU. In 1997, Day co-founded Finlay Press, and in the same year he lost the vision in his left eye due to a congenital deformity. In early 2010, he moved to Melbourne, founded Mountains Brown Press, and met his future wife. Together they moved to Toronto, Canada (2010), then to Brooklyn, NY (2011). Day lives in Melbourne, with his wife and their daughter. Drawings Day first came to public attention in 2000 when he was invited to exhibit in the Australian Drawing Biennale.2000 The Australian Drawing Biennale. Catalogue. There his drawings were shown alongside those of Davida Allen, Rick Amor, Guo Jian, Euan Macleod, John Olsen, Gloria Petyarre, and Harry Wedge, among others. The exhibition catalogue states: \\"[Day] looks at things for himself ‚Ä¶ This is a rare quality, particularly when so many practitioners in the visual arts claim to be bored with image-making and, as a substitute, flirt with ideas.\\"2000 The Australian Drawing Biennale. Australian National University. p. 18. Primarily, Day's work is pictorial: at times detailed and realistic, while at other times brief and gestural - Peter Keneally describes Day's brief-gestural drawings as: deliriously smudgy and slapdash.Keneally. P, (2016)'Australian Poets: Lawrence;Page;Wallis;Giannoukos;' The Australian. 5 November 2016. There is an understated mood in Day's work, both in subject and material. His pictures invite the viewer into a one-on-one relationship with common things, this includes domestic objects, urban animals, garden plants, and the occasional portrait. It also includes memories, thoughts, and imaginary figurative inventions. All of which, are almost exclusively worked on modest size sheets of paper with modest materials (often coloured pencil and watercolour). In 2003, Sasha Grishin, art historian and critic, said: \\"There is a certain disarming honesty in [Day's] drawing, which are as much visual observations as they are thought-pictures ... between the seen and observed reality, and the realm of abstract thoughts and carnal desires.\\"Grishin. S, Disarmingly Honest in Small Grabs, The Canberra Times. 3 December 2003. From 2004 onward, Day has almost exclusively created images for artist's books, often in collaboration with Australian authors, including: Cassandra Atherton, Gary Catalano, Julian Davies, James Grieve, and Robin Wallace-Crabbe. In 2015, Day discussed aspects of illustration as a guest panellist on Collaboration at the Adelaide Writers' Week.http://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/2015/phil_day Artist's books A brief biographical note states: Phil Day has enjoyed illustrating other people's writing, then binding the results into books, since he was sixteen.When Books Die, Braidwood, NSW, Finlay Lloyd, 2006, p. 145. An early example of an artist's book illustrated by Day is Imaginary Thoughts and Their Beings (1995).http://search.slv.vic.gov.au/MAIN:Everything:SLV_VOYAGER3002365 Day became more prolific when he co-founded Finlay Press in 1997. By the close of Finlay Press in 2009, Day had illustrated 16 of Finlay Press's 23 titles. They are: Burly Gryphon (1997), Hungry Magpies (1997), Bomber (1997), Fth (1998), The Last Lost Doughnut (1998), Formingle (1998), Household: Eleven Poems (1998), A Pile of Hair (2003), Top Ten Twentieth Century Monsters (2003), Through Hoops (2005), Familiar Objects (2005), Goodbye Eggcup (2006), Cat's Eye (2008), I‚Äôll Build A Stairway To Paradise (2008), Day By Day (2009), Four Men and Their Ideas on the Erotic. Caren Florance remarked: \\" ... some of the most exciting untraditional private press work in Australia.\\"https://www.slv.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/La-Trobe- Journal-95-Caren-Florance.pdf In 2010, Day moved to Melbourne, and founded his private press - Mountains Brown Press. No longer having access to printing presses, Day altered his approach in order to continue his interest in making books. The most notable change being each book written in pencil by his hand. State Library of Victoria, History of the Book manager, Des Cowley observed: \\"‚Ä¶ [Day's Mountain Brown Press artist's books] represent an art stripped back to basics, a cathartic attempt to re-engage with the physical properties of the book, without the intervening layer of metal type and presses ‚Ä¶ there is a sense of spiritual renewal to be found here.\\"Cowley.

In 2012, Day wrote an essay for publication and review: Why Qi Baishi is better for me than Damien Hirst.Lost Art, Two essays on cultural dysfunction. Scott McCulloch, Australian Book Review, commented: \\"Spontaneous in his approach, Day utilizes various bits of visual information: tables, lists, Shakespeare quotes, typography that verges on concrete poetry ‚Ä¶ it sounds messy, but the connection and slippages of these digression make for an intoxicating and dissonant piece of prose.\\"[McCulloch. S, 2012. Big Business, Australian Book Review, No 345. p. 42] Day has continued to write using 'connections', 'slippages', and 'digressions', evident in his A Chink in a Daisy-Chain (2017), the first in a three-book series. A Chink in a Daisy-Chain concentrates on the embattled nature of individual intellectual and creative autonomy. Fiona Capp (Sydney Morning Herald) comments: \\"In the spirit of the absurdist and playful logic that characterises the Alice books, A Chink in a Daisy-Chain takes us into the rabbit warren of Day's mind as he free associates, one thought leading to another in a stream of consciousness ...\\"Capp. F, 2017.

Similar to his artist's books, included in Chink in a Daisy-Chain is a drawing by Day illustrating The Wasp in a Wig - the suppressed chapter from Carroll‚Äôs Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There.

Inspiration from these early illustrations have carried into Day's recent work. Dorothy Johnston, Sydney Morning Herald, observed: His line drawings enhance the mood of each scene, lightening it, sending up characters locked in earnest or self- serving conversation, or hopelessly in love; at other times giving a darker, sinister flavour to events ... revellers disguised as politicians, celebrities and cartoon animals tumble over one another right out of the frame.
