Early life and education Pope was raised in New Orleans, Louisiana and received a BA in economics from Excelsior College before graduating with a JD summa cum laude from the University of Washington School of Law. While still a law student, he sued the University of Washington for withholding social security taxes from student employees ineligible for retirement programs. Though he scored an initial court victory against the university, it was ultimately reversed on appeal by the Washington Supreme Court. Pope served seven years in the U.S. Army Reserve. Career =Law practice= After earning his law degree, Pope began to practice law in Washington, earning a reputation as a combative attorney. He has been cautioned by the Washington State Bar Association and fined by the state Court of Appeals. In 2006 he was removed from a case after informing the presiding judge that his mental health was \\"terrible\\" and that he suffered from \\"serious depression\\". Pope's law license was ultimately reinstated but he was reprimanded by the Washington State Bar Association in 2012 for misconduct in an unrelated matter. Pope is currently licensed to practice law in Washington but does not carry malpractice insurance. =Political campaigns= Pope has been elected and served as a Republican precinct committee officer, but has failed in at least a dozen attempts at higher office, running as both a Republican and a Democrat. Despite his record of electoral failure, Pope has been called by HorsesAss \\"several steps above the crank perennial candidates\\" and \\"the most cost-efficient candidate this state has ever seen,\\" regularly coming in second place in his races and scoring double-digit percentages of the vote. In his 2007 run against incumbent King County Council member Jane Hague, Pope received 41-percent of the vote, despite spending less than $35,000 on his campaign, compared to Hague's $433,000. His 2000 run against incumbent Attorney-General Christine Gregoire netted 636,738 votes, 38-percent of the total. Among other offices he's sought are those of Shoreline city councilor, Shoreline Water District commissioner, Port of Seattle commissioner, King County assessor, and King County prosecutor. Pope's best showing was in a non-partisan district court judge race in which he earned 44-percent of the vote. Additionally, Pope has garnered a reputation as a dogged researcher of his political opponents. During the 2007 race against Hague, Pope uncovered numerous campaign finance violations committed by Hague and also exposed that the judge in Hague's DUI trial was a political ally of Hague, as a result of which he was reassigned. During a campaign for Port of Seattle commission in 2005, he successfully lodged complaints against incumbent Pat Davis' financial reporting that resulted in a $10,000 fine against Davis. Research Pope conducted into the King County Republican Party's finances exposed errors in campaign disclosures that resulted in the levy of $40,000 in fines. During the 2006 United States Senate election in Washington, Pope dug-up records of Green Party candidate Aaron Dixon's unpaid child support, posting it to the comments sections of local blogs and helping to sink Dixon's upstart campaign.

The oldest portion of the house is a log structure built in 1863, making it one of the few surviving pre-Civil War structures in the county. It is also notable as a place frequented by baseball legend Ty Cobb in his childhood; he was a grandson of the original builder, John Franklin Cobb. The house is, outside of the log cabin at its core, a rambling structure consisting of a variety of additions to the original log cabin. The house has been enclosed in weatherboarding since the 1880s. It was for many years the center of a farm of some 150-200 acres, and was in the Cobb family until 1977. The house, as well as outbuildings on a roughly six-acre parcel, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The house is located about two tenths of a mile down a private drive, west of US Route 129-19, about seven-tenths of a mile south of its junction with SR 1583.

Career George MacDonald started work on role-playing games while at college, by adding more detailed super powers to Gamescience's Superhero: 2044 RPG (1977) and ultimately creating his own original system which Steve Peterson typed up, and which eventually became the superhero RPG, Champions (1981). MacDonald and Peterson had only enough money to print 1,500 copies of the game and hand-collated the pages, and they sold their new game at Pacific Origins 1981; they were surprised to see it sell very well, selling 1,000 of their 1,500 copies at the convention. After this early success, MacDonald and Peterson started Hero Games as a publishing label. By 1982, they were ready to take the next step in turning Hero Games into a professional business, and opened up an office and asked Ray Greer to join them as a partner and handle marketing and sales, with Bruce Harlick soon joining them as Hero's first employee. Flying Buffalo and Hero Games formed an alliance thanks to a chance meeting between Michael Stackpole and MacDonald at a 1982 convention. MacDonald later became Senior Game Developer at SSI. MacDonald was the developer on the Gold Box game Pool of Radiance (1988).

Biography Vahey was born in 1949Independent Review arising from the criminal conduct of William Vahey (p. 10), southbank.org; accessed August 28, 2014. at West Point, New York, to a decorated World War II pilot father. He graduated from college in 1972. In January 1973, he moved to Iran, where he taught at Tehran American School until 1973, after which he taught at other schools in Lebanon, Spain, Greece, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. From 1992 to 2002, he taught at Jakarta International School in Indonesia. In 2009, he began teaching history and geography at Southbank International School. He continued to work there until 2013. In August 2013, he began teaching at the American Nicaraguan School in Managua and remained a teacher there until his death. He also coached basketball and led school trips to Bahrain, Turkey, Africa, Costa Rica, Nepal, Panama and Jordan. During this time, he kept homes in London and Hilton Head Island. Child molestation Vahey was arrested in 1969 at the age of 20 for child molestation, after which he told the police he began touching boys without their consent when he was 14, as a Boy Scout. After pleading guilty to one charge of lascivious behavior, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail and 5 years of probation, but was allowed to leave the country unsupervised and move to Iran after two years. He registered as a sex offender in January 1970 but failed to sign the sex offender registry, which, according to the BBC, was the reason his previous abuses went undetected by school officials. In March 2014, he was confronted about obscene images of boys found on his flash drive by an administrator of his employer, the American Nicaraguan School. The flash drive in question had originally been stolen by a maid at the school, but it wasn't until she gave it to school director Gloria Doll that its contents became known. Doll found the flash drive contained sexually graphic images of at least 90 boys being molested by Vahey, catalogued by locations and dates corresponding to field trips Vahey went on beginning in 2008. After being confronted, Vahey confessed he had been molesting boys for his entire life, attributing this to him having himself been molested as a child. Some of his victims, according to the FBI, had been drugged and may therefore have no memory of their abuse; he would offer them Oreo cookies laced with sleeping pills. On April 22, Metropolitan Police officers raided Vahey's residence in north-east London, where they found a laptop and 11 more flash drives. According to the FBI, hundreds of people have contacted them and said that either Vahey molested them or they wanted to provide more information in their investigation into his abuses. =Reactions= Southbank International School's chair of governors, Sir Chris Woodhead, reacted to the news of Vahey's crimes by describing them as the \\"worst thing that I've ever been involved in in 40 years of education\\"; that Vahey was able to teach at Southbank despite having been convicted for child molestation in 1969 \\"beggars belief\\". According to Scotland Yard commander Graham McNulty, \\"a significant number\\" of parents of Southbank students told officials they did not want to know if Vahey had molested their children. After Vahey's long history of child abuse came to light, Gloria Doll said that he had become \\"famous for wanting to lead student experience trips\\", and that this was the reason many of his previous schools hired him. She also said that, to her knowledge, none of her students had been molested by him. Doll faced some criticism for not acting sooner to stop him from doing so while she was director of the American Nicaraguan School. Three of the school's employees wrote an anonymous letter stating that Doll, after acquiring Vahey's memory stick, fired him but still let him go home. Doll said she had consulted a school board member and the school's lawyer prior to making this decision and said the lawyer had told her that since none of the children in the photos had been molested in Nicaragua, they had no obligation to contact authorities. The employees pointed out that child pornography is illegal in Nicaragua no matter what. After she resigned her position at the school on May 20, many speculated that this was for reasons relating to her handling of this scandal. Nevertheless, the school board, who had supported her for the previous several weeks, treated her resignation as a routine matter that had nothing to do with the Vahey scandal. =Hugh Davies investigation= An investigation by barrister Hugh Davies, the interim findings of which were released on July 31, 2014, concluded that Southbank International did not properly address concerns about Vahey's behavior while he taught there, and that they failed to take references before offering him a teaching job. The review also criticized the school for \\"inadequate\\" record keeping. Woodhead commended the report for its \\"very helpful recommendations on how safeguarding at Southbank International School can be improved yet further.\\" According to the BBC, another stage of the investigation is under development, and will focus on \\"the recruitment procedure when Vahey was hired and how incidents concerning his behaviour were reported.\\" In November 2014, The Guardian reported on a subsequent report by Davies, which concluded that Southbank International's headmaster dismissed complaints against Vahey's conduct on a field trip as \\"unfair pressure\\" by \\"vindictive parents\\", and did not report these complaints to child protection authorities. Lawsuit On June 22, 2014, The Observer reported that the parents of about 60 children believed to have been abused by Vahey while he taught at Southbank had sued the school. The parents will be advised by lawyers from London-based firm Edwin Coe LLP. It was also reported that Chris Woodhead, the founder of Southbank's parent company, Cognita, intended to commission a barrister to determine how Vahey was allowed to work at the school, which has said that they made checks dating back 17 years on Vahey's background. Efforts to seek compensation On June 14, 2016, it was reported that families of more than a dozen current and former Southbank pupils (all of whom attended the school while Vahey taught there) were attempting to negotiate a financial settlement of as much as ¬£1.5 million with the school. A lawyer representing the families told the Guardian that if these negotiations failed, they might take legal action against the school. Suicide Vahey's first attempt at suicide occurred in Nicaragua immediately after a school maid stole his flash drive. Emergency officials initially declared him dead with high levels of toxins in his blood. However, he was eventually revived and survived the attempt. On March 21, 2014, he succeeded in committing suicide in Luverne, Minnesota, by stabbing himself in the chest. Vahey was 64 years old. He was married and had two adult children.

It has about 491 inhabitants.  Location  Reichmannshausen is located 341 meters above sea level on the Schlettach plateau. It is completely surrounded by forest, most of which is state owned. The Frankish style homesteads are in a widespread arrangement with exposed timber-framed construction. The pointed steeple of the St. George church towers above the village. Two small streams, one of which is dammed north at the village pond, merge southwest of the church to form the Ried stream on which a mill is located. Further east there is a new residential development located on the Ottersee (Otter lake) which was formerly a vacation cottage area.  History  Reichmannshausen was developed from a clearing in the land of the neighboring Wettringen royal manor, to which it belonged until 1804. The earliest known reference to the village notes a \\"Richalmeshusen\\" (houses of Richalm) and comes from a 1290 deed, which mentions that it was the seat of the Mariaburghausen cloister. By 1522, there were already 34 houses around the original Richalm farmstead. The village passed hands several more times: the House of Henneberg owned Reichmannshausen until the family became extinct in 1583. The village then passed to the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg followed by a short rule by the Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1803 to 1804, and then became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1814. In 1631, during the Thirty Years' War, the Protestant army of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden came to the aid of German Lutherans in the region. Liborius Wagner was a Catholic priest in the parish of Sulzdorf. He fled from the invading forces five kilometers away to Reichmannshausen where he hid in the local schoolhouse. Protestant soldiers tracked him down and he was taken to the nearby Mainberg castle. The soldiers tried to force him to renounce his Catholic faith. Wagner refused; when asked if he was still Catholic, he replied, \\"I live, I suffer, and I die a papal Catholic.\\" After five days of torture, he died on 9 December 1631. His body was thrown into the nearby Main River. He was beatified by the Catholic church on March 24, 1974. Between the World Wars, Reichmannshausen was known as a ‚Äúforest air health resort‚Äù due to its remoteness, tranquility, and dense forest. The village had a regular motor coach service to Schweinfurt.  Name  In its current form the English translation is \\"Rich Man's City\\"; however, the name has Frankish origins. An early settler named Richalm most likely gave name to the village \\"Richalmeshusen\\" or ‚Äúhouses of Richalm\\" as it appears in a 1290 deed. There was a lot of variation in the spelling of the village over the years. For example, a 1771 map shows the name \\"Reichenmanshausen\\" and a 1778 map shows the spelling \\"Reichinmannshausen\\".  Places of interest  * Catholic Church of St. George. Built in \\"Choir Tower\\" style. Little is known about the first St. George church. During the lifetime of Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn (1545-1617) the steeple was raised in ‚ÄúEchter style\\" in 1607. The nave was rebuilt at the end of the seventeenth century. It has side altars, a baptismal font (circa 1600), and the a Baroque pulpit (circa 1722), which was taken from the former Benedictine monastery Theres Abbey in the nearby village of Theres when it was demolished in 1809.Bavarian State Office of Historical Preservation List of Monuments in the Schonungen District * World War I Memorial.

Romney hut near Eastoft, Lincolnshire, July 2007 The Romney hut is a prefabricated steel structure used by the British military, developed during World War II to supersede the Iris hut. History At the outbreak of World War II, the British military developed a series of prefabricated huts to supplement the World-War-I-era Nissen hut. The Iris hut was one of these, a medium-scale hut of span and from to in length, with bays of sectional length able to be added as required. However, the Iris hut had a major design flaw: it was unable to resist the weight of snow lying on the roof and had a tendency to collapse after snowfalls. For this reason, it was superseded by the Romney hut by 1941. Both the Iris hut and the Romney hut were constructed of a clamped tubular steel frame with a central entrance. The hut was used to accommodate facilities for which abnormal roof spans were required. On some airfields, two or more Romney or Iris huts would be erected to accommodate large stores and workshops, or occasionally used as aircraft hangars.

Game Summary North Carolina was playing looking for its 4th National Championship while Illinois was playing in its first National Championship. It was a tight contest for much of the first half before an 8-0 run by North Carolina allowed them to take a 35-25 lead. Eventually they would take a 40-27 lead into halftime. North Carolina increased its lead to 15 at one point in the second half. But Illinois began a furious charge. At one point, they would hit seven consecutive shots from the floor to turn a fifteen-point lead back to four. Unfazed, North Carolina would push the lead back up to ten before a 10-0 run by the Illini tied the game at 65-65. Illinois would tie the game at 70-70 on a three by Luther Head. But North Carolina would fight back as freshman Marvin Williams tapped back a Rashad McCants missed shot to put North Carolina back in front. Illinois would get several cracks to take the lead but were unable to convert. Eventually, Raymond Felton was able to steal the ball from Luther Head, forcing Deron Williams to foul. However Felton converted on 1 of 2 free throws giving Illinois one last chance. Head's potential game-tying three pointer bounced high and out and went into the hands of Felton who this time connected on both free throws to give North Carolina a 75-70 victory. Illinois struggled offensively with what had succeeded the rest of the season, converting only 12 of a championship game record 40 three-point field goal attempts. With his stellar post play, North Carolina forward Sean May managed to get Illinois defenders into foul trouble; starting junior forward/center James Augustine fouled out, and his substitute, senior Jack Ingram, quickly amassed four fouls. May scored 26 points as he took the Most Outstanding Player (MOP) of the Final Four. For North Carolina head coach Roy Williams, it was his first national championship. Illinois was denied a chance to set the NCAA record for most wins in a season, instead tying the 1998‚Äì99 national runner-up Duke team with 37 (Kentucky has since won 38 games in two different seasons). For almost the entire 2004‚Äì05 season, Illinois and North Carolina were ranked #1 and #2, respectively, in all polls, and both teams were the favorites to meet in the national championship game. With its collection of raw talent, North Carolina would go on to field six players in the NBA draft, while four Illinois players would be selected in future drafts, with undrafted Roger Powell, Jr. also playing briefly in the NBA. In 2014, Sports Illustrated voted the 2005 Illinois team as the best team ever to not win a title.

Its format is a side hall plan with a simple hipped roof and two porch entries: a full-width front, east-facing porch and a small north-facing side porch. The house is currently home to the Mauricetown Historical Society and is located at the address of 1229 Front Street, Mauricetown, New Jersey. The house is open for tours twice a month.

A reconstructed cookhouse, echoing the house in materials, is set behind the house on the west lawn. The house is made accessible from Front Street by a gravel driveway leading to the side, north porch. The property has experienced significant restoration but still has some original historic fabric. Cookhouse of Capt. Edward Compton House. History The site of the current house was originally purchased by Edward Compton from his father, Samuel Compton, and mother, Sophia, in 1862 and described in the deed as ‚Äúa certain lot of land situate in the village of Mauricetown.‚ÄùDeed of Sale from Samuel Compton and wife to Edward Compton, 1 November 1862 (filed 26 March 1863), Cumberland County, New Jersey, Deed Book CB, page 288. County Clerk‚Äôs Office, Bridgeton, New Jersey. The Compton family densely populated Mauricetown and owned many parcels of land throughout, including the original plots of many other houses such as aptly named James Compton House and David Compton House further north on Front Street. Photograph from ca. 1880s - 1900s of Capt. Edward Compton House. The Edward Compton House was built in 1864 by local Mauricetown carpenters, Griffith Pichard and Samuel Cobb. The house‚Äôs 1864 construction date is determined due to a couple of sources including a Civil War letter written on December 15, 1863 by William T. Cobb, son of Samuel Cobb, the co-builder of the Captain Edward Compton house.Ludwick, Michael P. \\"Your Most Obedient Son\\": The Civil War Letters of William Tell Cobb. N.p.: College of William & Mary, 1995. Pg 128. The Historical Society also possesses a piece of an original column from the front fa√ßade of the house which contains a unique and awe- inspiring message from Samuel Cobb and further confirms the 1864 construction date. Front Street also bears the Edward Compton House‚Äôs twin, the Captain Isaac Peterson House. Built around the same year as Edward‚Äôs house on land originally owned by the Compton family, the house bears a striking resemblance to the Captain Edward Compton House in terms of much of the interior layout of the house, porches, and decorative elements. The dwelling is an Italianate structure, featuring extensive gingerbread brackets around the cornices of porches and the roofs, multiple eight sided ionic columns, and original iron fencing in the front lawn. The southern enclosed porch once led directly to cookhouse. Parts of the original cookhouse foundation remain, though the Historical Society has created a replica of the house in the back lawn between the Captain Edward Compton House and the Hoy House. In a photograph dated circa late 1800s, the house also has a large parapet on the Italianate roof. The house also possessed a cupola, another striking feature that other Italianate houses such as the Captain Isaac Peterson House and James Compton House possessed. The Captain Edward Compton House remains in the family despite Edward‚Äôs passing in 1870 from consumption.National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington, D.C.; Non-population Census Schedules for New Jersey, 1850-1880: Mortality (M1810); Archive Collection: M1810; Archive Roll Number: 1; Census Year: 1870; Census Location: Downe, Cumberland, New Jersey; Page: 74; Line: 1. Deeded in 1868, two years before Edward‚Äôs death, the house belonged to Elizabeth Compton, Emma‚Äôs mother, until 1887 (Elizabeth‚Äôs death occurring in 1884). The house then passes through a series of hands, including a lot of $1 stack transactions between family members. In an interview with a resident of Mauricetown, the resident recalled the house having been divided into two apartments during 1954 to 1964. The house also experienced harrowing conditions prior to the purchase of the building by the Mauricetown Historical Society. An almost complete restoration of the house took place after the purchase of the property in 1984. Much of the outer siding and decorative elements were eaten or rotted away, the interior was paneled and ridden with debris, and the plumbing and crawl space suffered from severe sewage issues. The restoration has spanned 25 years and continues today with improvements and detailing such as the replacement and addition of gingerbread brackets around the cornices of the porches and roofs.

For the first three decades of its existence the publication was closely associated with the Socialist Party of America (SPA). In 1936 as part of a large factional split in the SPA, the former Finnish Socialist Federation severed its connection to become the \\"Finnish American League for Democracy,\\" with Raivaaja remaining the official organ of this remodeled organization. During its final years the publication included both English language and Finnish language content. It was last edited by Marita Cauthen from 1984 until its termination in 2009. Today the not-for-profit Raivaaja Foundation still runs a website and an online bookstore.  History  =Establishment= The history of the broadsheet newspaper Raivaaja (The Pioneer) is traceable to an earlier publication, Pohjan T√§hti (The North Star), which was started in the Finnish-American enclave of Fitchburg, Massachusetts by a private entrepreneur, Alex Heisson, who sought to launch a profitable publication to serve the community's large and growing Finnish-speaking population.John I. Kolehmainen, Sow the Golden Seed: A History of the Fitchburg (Massachusetts) Finnish-American Newspaper Raivaaja (The Pioneer), 1905-1955. Fitchburg, MA: Raivaaja Publishing Co., 1955; pg. 29. Taking a calculated political risk, the aspiring capitalist publisher hired a talented socialist editor, √©migr√© Finnish newcomer Taavi Tainio. For a time the alliance seemed to be working, with the profit-seeking, nominally socialist publication quickly growing to a circulation of nearly 4,000. By the end of the year differences over the function and goals of the paper led to Heisson terminating his outspoken editor. The popular Taino's firing led to a spate of organizational activity by local Fitchburg socialists, who sought to establish a new publication with a more definite socialist orientation under Taino's direction. A mass meeting was held on January 1, 1905, at which it was decided to move forward with such a venture, and a board of directors was elected.Kolehmainen, Sow the Golden Seed, pg. 30. Fundraising was begun, reaching the $100 mark by the end of January,Kolehmainen, Sow the Golden Seed, pg. 31. and a room was rented to serve as the provisional office for the new publication ‚Äî ironically located directly across a corridor from the office of Pohjan T√§hti in an office building in downtown Fitchburg. On January 31, 1905, the new socialist newspaper, Raivaaja (The Pioneer) rolled off the press.Auvo Kostiainen, \\"Finns,\\" in Hoerder with Harzig (eds.), The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: Volume 1: Migrants from Northern Europe. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 226. The paper soon became a mainstay of the Finnish Socialist Federation, which joined the Socialist Party of America following a convention held in the summer of 1906. The initial subscription rate was set at $1.25 per year, postpaid through the mail, with fixed costs of approximately $300 per month projected,Kolehmainen, Sow the Golden Seed, pg. 33. including a salary of $12 per week to be paid to editor Tainio.Kolehmainen, Sow the Golden Seed, pg. 36. Rather than being owned by the Finnish Socialist Federation, Raivaaja was published by a holding company known as the Finnish Socialist Publishing Company (Suomalainen Sosialistinen Kustannusyhti√∂). This entity formally changed its name in 1929 to the more familiar Raivaaja Publishing Company. The circulation of the publication during its first year of existence was approximately 2,000 copies per issue. =Affiliations and ideology= Web press used for the production of Raivaaja, 1915. In its early years, Raivaaja was a radical newspaper loyal to the Socialist Party of America. It was the newspaper of the Finnish Socialist Federation's eastern district. The other papers were Ty√∂mies in the middle district, and Toveri in the west. During the World War I the War Department agents searched Raivaaja's officies because of its radical and anti-war ideas.Jan Voogd, \\"Maynard, Massachusetts: A House in the Village.\\" The History Press, 2007; pg. 45. In the early 1920s Raivaaja moved to a moderate social democratic position during the factional war of the Finnish Socialist Federation. The paper peaked with a circulation of 10,000 in 1927 before a long downward slide. The list of editors include major names of Finnish American labor movement such as Moses Hahl, Santeri Nuorteva, Aku P√§ivi√∂, Frans Josef Syrj√§l√§ and Oskari Tokoi. In 1936, in response to a split of the Socialist Party which saw more conservative elements leave to establish the Social Democratic Federation, the Finnish Socialist Federation similarly remade itself as the \\"Finnish American League for Democracy.\\"John I. Kolemainen, The Finns in America: A Bibliographic Guide to Their History. Hancock, MI: Suomi College, 1947; pg. 57. Although the underlying Finnish- American organization supporting the paper remained the same, Raivaaja also severed its connection from the Socialist Party from this date. In its last years, Raivaaja was a non-political newspaper of the Finnish-American community. =Frequency and circulation= Throughout the course of its existence, the frequency of Raivaaja varied over time. The paper launched in 1905 with a semi-weekly frequency, moving to three issues per week in 1907 before expanding to a daily publication schedule (except Sundays) in 1910. From its initial press run of about 2,000, Raivaaja grew to a circulation of 8,300 by the end of its first decade. Despite two bitter splits of the Finnish Socialist Federation, featuring the departure of industrial unionists close to the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1914-1915 and to the group's communist wing in 1919-1921,Kolemainen, The Finns in America, pp. 56-57. the paper continued to maintain its readership, hitting a circulation of 10,000 in 1927. This proved to be the high-water mark for the publication, however, as restrictions to American immigration law imposed in the 1920s virtually halted Finnish-speaking newcomers for many years. With the restriction of immigration into the United States in the 1920s, the coming of the Great Depression in 1929, and the ensuing depression decade, readership of the Finnish language press in the United States began to atrophy.A. William Hoglund, \\"The Finnish Press,\\" in Sally M. Miller (ed.), The Ethnic Press in the United States: A Historical Analysis and Handbook. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 111. In the two decades from 1920 to 1940, the number of Finnish speakers in America who were born abroad fell by 27 percent, declining to just over 117,000 ‚Äî constricting possible readership. Second generation Finnish- Americans, importantly, gravitated towards the English language press rather than to Raivaaja and the host of other Finnish language papers published in the USA. Raivaaja's daily schedule was maintained throughout the 1940s, when the paper began appearing less frequently due to declining circulation and revenue. During the 1960s the paper was being issued only three times a week, with a further decline to semi-weekly and later weekly status in the 1970s. By 1950 the circulation of the newspaper had fallen to 5,750, with further attrition following until by the middle of the 1970s a plateau of just over 2,000 copies was reached. This same figure would be claimed by the publication more than a quarter century later.Elizabeth Mehren, \\"'Invisible' Finnish Community Still Has One Proud Voice Left,\\" Los Angeles Times, Dec. 15, 2003. =Final years= From 1984 until its termination in April 2009, the paper was edited by Marita Cauthen.Marita Cauthen Finnish Expatriate Parliament. Retrieved 14 May 2014. The paper ran both English-language and Finnish- language content during its final years. The paper was finally ceased in April 2009 due to the increase of the postage rates.

He is mostly remembered for his work on ITC classic TV series The Saint, as well as several films of the franchise, and as the author of the best-selling novel Red Omega. Life John Kruse was born in England and educated at Harrow. His father, Jack Frederick Conrad Kruse, was a captain in the Royal Navy and close associate of tycoon Lord Rothermere, founder of the Daily Mail. A wealthy couple, Kruse's parents lived between London and the French Riviera, but the 1929 Crash greatly damaged their fortune.Jim Wilson, Nazi Princess: Hitler, Lord Rothermere and Princess Stephanie von Hohenlohe, The History Press, 2011 During World War Two, John served as a liaison officer in India, the Middle East and Italy. After the war, he returned to England to find his home bombed, his parents dead, and no family business. At the age of twenty-six, he began a new career from scratch. He joined Pinewood Film Studios as a clapper boy and, during the next seven years, progressed to become cameraman, at the same time working nights to perfect his writing. His short stories began to appear in magazines in Britain and the United States in the early fifties; some of these stories were later developed into screenplays. Hell Drivers (1957) was his first credited film, based on his own short story and co-scripted with director Cy Endfield. By 1954 Kruse had switched to full-time scriptwriting, working in over a dozen of films. Starting in the 60's, he also wrote many hundreds of episodes for British and international TV shows, including The Avengers, Shoestring, Colditz, The Persuaders!, and most famously The Saint, starring Roger Moore. In 1981, Kruse abandoned screenwriting and moved to Almu√±√©car, in Granada, Spain, where he began a new career as a novelist. He published three novels. The first one, Red Omega (1981), became a best-seller‚Äîa cold war spy thriller involving a CIA plot to murder Stalin using a rogue agent from Extremadura who survived the gulags. It was later followed by a sequel, Long Live the Dead, and Hour of the Lily, an epic story of love and war in Russian-occupied Afghanistan. After these three novels, Kruse took up painting. He died in Almu√±√©car in 2004.

Stand-up comedian and former Saturday Night Live writer John Mulaney created the show and starred as a fictionalized version of himself. At the beginning of each episode, and sometimes throughout, Mulaney would perform stand-up comedy to the studio audience. The show suffered from low ratings and poor critical reviews, and was cancelled in March 2015. Premise John Mulaney is a comedian living in New York City with his roommates‚ÄîJane (Nasim Pedrad), a personal trainer with emotional issues, and Motif (Seaton Smith), a fellow stand-up comedian. John often receives advice from his elderly Jewish neighbor Oscar (Elliott Gould), and visits from his odd and annoying friend Andre (Zack Pearlman), a small-time drug dealer. John's life changes when he's hired as a writer for Lou Cannon (Martin Short), an eccentric, legendary comedian and game show host.

Mulaney re-tooled the pilot,Dodds, Eric (May 15, 2014), \\"8 Ways the Trailer for Mulaney Resembles Seinfeld\\". TIME. :1 and then pitched it to Fox, who picked the show up with a cautious six-episode commitment. Fox later ordered an additional ten episodes. A trailer was released on May 12, 2014, along with an announcement that the show would air Sunday nights at 9:30 p.m., replacing the Seth MacFarlane sitcom, American Dad!, which moved to TBS. The series premiered October 5, 2014. On October 18, 2014, the day before the third episode was supposed to air, Fox announced it was cutting three episodes from its order. This resulted in the production of Mulaney being shut down, as the thirteenth episode had already been filmed and production of the fourteenth was about to begin. Less than a month later, Fox moved Mulaney into the 7:30 PM timeslot where Bob's Burgers had been airing. The season ended on February 15, 2015 and Fox announced Mulaneys cancellation shortly thereafter. Episodes Reception Even before Mulaney aired, critics were wary of the direction of the show. After viewing the show's trailer, Eric Dodds with TIME magazine penned an article called, \\"8 Ways the Trailer for Mulaney Resembles Seinfeld,\\" and said it could \\"trigger a little d√©j√† vu.\\" In regard to its multi-camera format, Canadian magazine Maclean's asked, \\"why would a cool comic pick such an uncool format?\\"Weinman, Jaime J. (August 4, 2014), \\"'The New Seinfeld'\\". Maclean's. 127 (30/31):60-62 Ultimately, the show was universally panned by critics, with most reviews drawing unflattering comparisons to Seinfeld. On Rotten Tomatoes, the show has an approval rating of 17% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 4.27/10. The site's critical consensus states, \\"John Mulaney, we know Jerry Seinfeld. Seinfeld was funny. Mulaney, you're no Seinfeld.\\" On Metacritic, the series has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".

The show was named the fourth-worst show of 2014 by Entertainment Weekly. Mulaney fared poorly commercially as well, with the series premiere only getting 2.3 million viewers, the weakest scores for any of the fall's series premieres.

Founded in 1998, the museum was housed in the former St. Paul's Catholic Church along the Rock River. The museum closed its doors in 2018 due to insufficient funding. History Joyce Berg, the founder of the museum, began collecting angels in 1976, first acquiring an Italian bisque figurine of two angels on a seesaw. By 1994, her collection was noticed by the National Inquirer, who wrote about her under the headline, \\"Heavens above! Grandma's living with 10,455 angels.\\" The museum itself was first conceived in 1995 when Berg ran out of room for her collection and began seeking a new place to house it. Around the same time, Beloit's St. Paul's Catholic Church was being threatened with demolition to make way for a new development. Berg chose the church, and with the help of Beloit citizens the church was converted into a museum. It opened on May 1, 1998 with an annual rent of $1 to the City of Beloit. For special visits to the museum, Berg sometimes wore an angel costume including cherub socks, angel earrings, a halo and wings. The museum closed in 2018 after being open 20 years. In a letter to the community, the museum's board of trustees wrote: \\"We do not have sufficient funds, memberships, corporate sponsors, or volunteers to staff and operate the museum.\\" The museum's collections were auctioned in October of 2018 through Beloit Auction & Realty Inc. In 2019, the City of Beloit had made plans to convert St. Paul's Catholic Church into an event venue. Collections The Angel Museum claimed to have the largest private collection of angel figurines, and the museum's collection was cited by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2001 as the largest of its kind. By December of 2008, the collection numbered over 13,600, with approximately 10,000 on display in the museum on permanent loan from Berg. The angels are from more than 60 countries and range in size from thimble dimensions to more than tall. In addition to porcelain, glass, copper, and acrylic, materials include lambskin, corn husks, tree roots, and spaghetti. Two concrete angels weighing each stand in front of the building. The museum was also notable for having housed Oprah Winfrey's collection of 571 black angel figurines. During a 1997 episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show, Winfrey told Cher that black angel figurines were difficult to find. Winfrey's fans then began sending her figurines in significant numbers, and Winfrey had to ask her fans to stop. Winfrey donated her collection to the Angel Museum later in 1997, shortly before the museum was set to open. Others had donated angels to the museum as well, often as memorials to loved ones.

It is operated and maintained by the Catholic Cemeteries of the Archdiocese of Washington, Inc. At the time of the cemetery's consecration in 1956, it was the first Roman Catholic archdiocesan cemetery to open in the Washington metropolitan area in 70 years. The grounds of Gate of Heaven Cemetery are centered around a series of internal roads and pathways, which in combination, form the shape of the Latin Cross. About the cemetery The District of Columbia was founded in 1791, and initially several small Roman Catholic cemeteries were established in the city. The last of these, St. Mary's Catholic Cemetery on Lincoln Road NE, was organized in 1870. Despite the rapid growth in the city's population during the next 70 years, no new Catholic cemeteries were organized within the Archdiocese of Washington. The Right Reverend Monsignor Edward L. Buckley of the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle was aware of the need to plan ahead, however, and began advocating for the purchase of land for a new burying ground. In 1928, the Catholic Cemetery Association, a private, nonprofit organization, which purchased land for the creation of Catholic cemeteries, purchased of land from the Rabbitt family in Montgomery County, Maryland. The intent was to name the new cemetery \\"New Mount Olivet,\\" after its District of Columbia‚Äìlocated Mount Olivet Cemetery, although no name was ever formally adopted. By 1955, it was clear that a new cemetery was sorely needed in the Archdiocese of Washington. The Catholic Cemetery Association transferred its title to this land to the archdiocese, and a new cemetery, named Gate of Heaven, was established. Gate of Heaven Cemetery was laid out around a roadway which was designed in the shape of a cruciform and was lined with trees. Four roughly rectangular sections extend from each side of this cruciform-shaped roadway. Life-size Stations of the Cross were placed at intervals in this central section. All of the roadways were named for saints, and numerous shrines to saints were spread amongst the cemetery's 28 sections. A 100-seat chapel was constructed at the center of the cruciform-shaped roadway. The cemetery's main gate is particularly notable. It features large wrought iron gates set in masonry pylons high and wide. Just inside and to the right of the main gate was a small caretaker's cottage made of stone. The cemetery was dedicated on June 17, 1956, by the Most Reverend Patrick O'Boyle, Archbishop of Washington. Gate of Heaven Cemetery began receiving interments at the beginning of July 1956. Cemetery grounds The perimeter of Gate of Heaven Cemetery is bounded by Georgia Avenue, to the southwest; Connecticut Avenue, to the northwest; Peppertree Lane, Strathmore Local Park, and Strathmore Elementary School, to the northeast; and the Aspen Manor Shopping Center, Beret Neighborhood Conservation Area, and Beret and Bustleton lanes, to the southeast. A portion of the northeast corner of the cemetery was sold in the 1960s or 1970s to the state of Maryland, as a means of raising funds for the trust account that maintains the cemetery. Strathmore Local Park and Strathmore Elementary School were constructed on this land. Gate of Heaven Cemetery only used about half of its acreage when it opened in 1956, and only in the late 1990s began expanding onto its unused land. Gate of Heaven Cemetery is a traditional lawn cemetery. The burial area is a lawn, with trees and shrubs around the perimeter. Most gravestones are flush with the earth, with only a few above-ground memorials. The cemetery also has several mausoleums for interment, as well as several columbaria. In addition, Gate of Heaven staff administer St. John's Cemetery, located on the grounds of St. John the Evangelist Parish's Saint John the Evangelist Historic Church, at 9700 Rosensteel Avenue, in the Forest Glen section of Silver Spring.

He was also the organizer of the Detroit Orchestral Association, which later became the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, a trustee of the Detroit Museum of Art, and the owner of the Detroit Wolverines baseball team in the National League from 1885 to 1888. Biography Stearns was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1854, the son of Frederick and Eliza (Kimball) Stearns. He moved to Detroit with his parents as a child and was educated at the Philo M. Patterson Classical School. He enrolled in the University of Michigan in 1873 where he was the captain and second baseman for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team. He left the university as a junior to join his father's pharmaceutical manufacturing business, Frederick Stearns & Company. He became president of the company in 1887. Stearns resigned as president of the family business in 1921 to become chairman of the board. In 1885, Stearns acquired the Detroit Wolverines baseball club and became its president. During his ownership, the team acquired a number of star players, including future Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Sam Thompson and Dan Brouthers. Stearns spent $25,000 (equal to $ today) between 1885 and 1887 to turn Detroit into a powerhouse team. His 1887 team won the National League pennant and went on to defeat St. Louis in the 1887 World Series. Stearns also served as a trustee of the Detroit Museum of Art and was the organizer of the Detroit Orchestral Association, which later became the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. He later moved to Beverly Hills and served on the board of directors of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. Stearns was married in October 1878 to Helen E. Sweet. They had three children, Frederick Sweet Stearns, Marjorie (Stearns) Dyar, and Alan Stearns. Their Elizabethan home on Jefferson Avenue in Detroit was known as \\"Red Gables\\" and is now a registered historic site. The Detroit Century Box, a time capsule, contains a letter written by Stearns in 1900.  See also  * Frederick K.

None of her poems appeared in print until after she was twenty; they were then published anonymously in the Literary Gazette, and other periodicals. Dr. Park removed to Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1831, accompanied by his daughter, who lived with him until October 1840, when she married the Rev. E. B. Hall, of Providence, Rhode Island. Miriam, a Dramatic Sketch, her most notable work, was begun in the summer of 1826, finished the following summer, and published ten years later. Her other principal work is in prose, Joanna of Naples, an Historical Tale, published in 1838. Hannah, the Mother of Samuel the Prophet and Judge of Israel (1839) was, like Miriam, a verse play. Early years and education Louisa Jane Park was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, February 7, 1802. Her parents were Dr. John Park and Louisa (Adams) Park. The father was a physician who had given up his medical practice when she was two, to move to Boston for the purpose of editing the New-England Repertory, a leading political journal of the Federal party. In a few years, he became weary of the conflict, then waged with so much violence, and, urged to do so by some of the most intelligent citizens, opened the Boston Lyceum for Young Ladies, in which a more thorough education might be received than was common in that period. His daughter was then in her tenth year. He had already made her familiar with Milton and Shakespere; and it was partly with the view of executing his plans for her education that he decided to become a public teacher. His school was opened in the spring of 1811, and for twenty years was eminently successful. His daughter, except when her studies were interrupted by ill-health (in early years, she showed symptoms of a delicate constitution), was eight years his pupil. She was an industrious scholar, and the thoroughness of her study shows itself all through her works by her chaste and correct style. She continued in her father's school until she was seventeen. Career Her writings show that her mind was wisely as well as carefully disciplined, and probably her habits of composition were formed at an early period. She published nothing, however, until she was twenty years of age, and then anonymously, in the Literary Gazette, and other papers and magazines. In 1831, her father retired to Worcester, Massachusetts, carrying with him a library of some 3,000 volumes, containing many valuable works in Latin, French, and Italian. During her partial blindness, he read to her several hours every day, and assisted her in collecting the materials for her tale of Joanna of Naples, an Historical Tale (1838), and for a biographical notice of Elizabeth Carter, the English authoress. Samuel Austin Allibone said that few American poetical compositions were more highly commended than \\"Miriam,\\" Hall's finest work, which was written in 1826. She wrote it only for amusement, as she did many little poems and tales which she destroyed. The first half of this drama was read at a small literary party in Boston. The author, not being known, was present, and was encouraged by the remarks it occasioned to finish it in the following summer. Her father forbade her suggestion to burn it; it was read, as completed, in the winter of 1826, and the authorship disclosed, but she did not publish it for several years. She saw its defects more distinctly than before, when it appeared in print, and resolved never again to attempt anything so long in the form of poetry. Her eyesight failed for four or five years, during which time she was almost entirely deprived of the use of books, writing, and needlework. \\"Miriam\\" was published in 1837. It received the best approval of contemporary criticism, and a second edition, appeared in the following year. Hall had not proposed to herself to write a tragedy, but a dramatic poem, and the result was an instance of a successful accomplishment. On October 1, 1840, she married Rev. Edward B. Hall, a Unitarian minister of Providence, Rhode Island, where she was occupied with domestic affairs, and in the duties which grew out of her relation to her husband's society, to bestow much further attention upon literature. A volume of Hall's writings, entitled Verse and Prose, was published in 1850. Rev. Hall died in 1866, and his widow continued to reside in Providence until 1872, when she removed to Boston, where she resided thereafter. Hall lacked confidence in her own powers, and was always distrustful of the public reception of her articles. She would have written much more but for this reason, together with ill-health and impaired eye-sight.

He wrote books on the love-life of Princess Margaret and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales (The Murder of Princess Diana), as well a series of books of obscure facts with the theme of \\"Useless Information\\", some of which was wildly erroneous; for example, \\"It would take 150 million years to drive a car to the sun\\" in The Totally Awesome Book of Useless Information. Also noted as a raconteur and publican, for many years he ran one of Soho's landmark pubs, The French House. Career Botham was educated at Dulwich College and apprenticed on The Croydon Advertiser, then became the foreign editor for the Daily Sketch at the age of 21. He then proceeded to work for many tabloids, including the News of the World where he was chief investigative reporter for a period. Later, he became European editor of the National Enquirer. In 1997, at the funeral of television presenter Hughie Green, Botham revealed that Green was the biological father of entertainer Paula Yates. Selling that information to the press is reported to have earned him ¬£100,000. In 2008, Botham was portrayed by Danny Webb in the BBC Four drama Hughie Green, Most Sincerely. After his death, The Daily Telegraph referred to Botham as \\"one of the hard-drinking reporters who made British newspapers the liveliest in the world\\". Roy Greenslade in The Guardian called him \\"the epitome of a Fleet Street scandal-monger and happy to be regarded as such\\".

Construction of the park, which cost $38 million, began in 2012 and the park officially opened in June 2016. The park is located between Garfield Avenue and Woodward Street near the Garfield Avenue Hudson Bergen Light Rail station. Directly south of Berry Lane Park is Canal Crossing, an adjacent brownfield site slated for a future residential development. The park will be part of the greenway planned along the former route of the Morris Canal.http://morriscanaljc.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/techmemo2_revised_10-18-12.pdf Berry Lane Park is the largest municipal park in Jersey City. Features include two basketball courts, two tennis courts, a baseball field, a soccer field, a playground, a rain garden, 600 new trees, and a splash pad water park. New park features coexist with older existing structures that have been preserved or modified. The Berry Lane Park project site includes 11 properties formerly used as rail yards, auto repair shops, industrial facilities, and warehouses. The site required significant environmental investigation and remediation due to petroleum and heavy metal contamination. A former chromium processing plant operated by PPG Industries caused substantial Hexavalent chromium contamination on the Berry Lane Park property and other adjacent properties, but PPG Industries agreed to remove 700,000 tons of hazardous waste from this and several other sites in the area. Post-environmental remediation construction began on Wednesday August 22, 2012. The first and second phases of the project included final environmental remediation of contaminants and grading of the land as well as construction of the baseball field, and irrigation systems. The third phase of the project, which included installation of over 100 high-efficiency lights throughout the park, began in April 2014. The fourth phase of the project, which included completion of the turf baseball and soccer fields as well as construction of event spaces, began during the summer of 2014. The final phase of construction, which included concessions facilities, restrooms, basketball courts, a dog run, and other smaller park features, began after the fourth phase is complete. In October 2014, Jersey City received a $5 million grant from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority that will facilitate completion of a large portion of the park in a single phase. The park officially opened to the public in June 2016. Funding for the project includes grants from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, Hudson County, a Community Development Block Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). At the grand opening of the park, Jersey City, New Jersey mayor Steven Fulop announced a grant from the Tony Hawk Foundation to build a skate park. A new baseball field opened in October 2016.

Booby Booby (Jian-Niao or Jianniao, È≤£È∏ü) UAV is the first Chinese UAV that is capable of being launched underwater. This Chinese experimental UAV is also the second UAV in the world that can be launched underwater, after Lockheed Martin Cormorant. Booby UAV is designed by BUAA Cruise Sky (Xun-Tian or Xuntian, Â∑°Â§©) team which included members such as students Mr. Yao Guo-Cai (ÂßöÂõΩÊâç) and Mr. Zhang Yi-Cheng (Âº†‰ª•Êàê), and the team is headed by associate professor Mr. Liang Jian-Hong (Ê¢ÅÂª∫ÂÆè). The team was first formed in 2004 and the UAV took a year to develop, and finally made its public debut in October 2012 at the sixtieth anniversary of BUAA. The UAV also appeared in the 2013 AVIC Challenger Cup competition. Long Eagle Long Eagle (Chang-Ying or Changying, ÈïøÈπ∞) UAV is a Chinese high altitude, long endurance (HALE) jet powered UAV designed by UAV Design and Research Institute (Âåó‰∫¨Ëà™Á©∫Ëà™Â§©Â§ßÂ≠¶Êó†‰∫∫È©æÈ©∂È£ûË°åÂô®ËÆæËÆ°Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ) (UAVDRI) of BUAA. The program first begun in 2000, but the existence of the program was officially confirmed by the Chinese government almost a decade later at 8th Zhuhai Airshow in 2008. The program was finally completed in 2011, under strict secrecy with little information released to the public. The general designer of Long Eagle is then 36-year-old department chairman Mr. Xiang Jin-Wu (ÂêëÈî¶Ê≠¶, 1964 -), who was eventually promoted to the position of the head of UAVDRI of BUAA, and there were two deputy general designers, Mrs. Wei Zhi-Mian (Èü¶ÂøóÊ£â) and Mr. Wang Yin-Xun (ÁéãËã±Âãã), who is also responsible for flight control system. An associate dean of BUAA, Mr. Fei Bin-Jun (Ë¥πÊñåÂÜõ) and an assistant dean of BUAA, Mr. Li Xin-Jun (ÊùéÊñ∞ÂÜõ) were assigned as the project manager and deputy project manager respectively, and the technical staff of the project design team includes more than a hundred twenty members, some of whom came from the direct competitor of BUAA, NUAA, such as Mr. Wang Hong-Lun (ÁéãÂÆè‰º¶). The current deputy head of UAVDRI of BUAA, Mr. Guo Hong (ÈÉ≠ÂÆè), who was the youngest professor at BUAA at the time, was assigned as chief quality engineer. Externally, BUAA Long Eagle looks extremely similar to Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk and another Chinese UAV, CAIG Sky Wing III, and performs similar missions, but the exact performance parameter and physical characteristics of BUAA Long Eagle has not yet publicized by official Chinese governmental sources yet.Long Eagle Drone-6 Drone-6 (Ba-6 orÈù∂-6) UAV is a high speed drone developed by BUAA to support the development of HQ-3 surface-to-air missile (SAM). High speed drones were needed to support the development of SAMs, but in the early 1960s, Chinese attempt to import high speed drones failed due to international embargo, and China had to come up with its own solution. Proposal begun in 1964 and was approved in December of that same year. Originally, BUAA was a subcontractor in the initial assignment of November 1965, but in May 1967 in the reassignement, it became the prime contractor. During the reassignment, additional requirement was issued: in addition to be a high speed drone, another task added was to simulate Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird in support of the development of HQ-3, thus increased the performance specification. Drone-6 airframe is based on HQ-2 SAM, with control surfaces modified. One control surface at the empennage is deleted and the rest three were enlarged. A pair of control surfaces near the nose cone is also deleted. A control surface mounted in the midsection of the missile is also deleted, and the remaining three are enlarged, but the one control surface mounted opposite to the one deleted is moved backward toward the empennage. The location of the deleted control surface in the middle is used for installation of a ramjet engine, designed by the 3rd Academy of the Ministry of Aerospace Industry. Control surfaces are constructed of fiber glass and in chopped delta wing shape. CF-03B ramjet is the propulsion engine of Drone-6 and it required mother aircraft to reach speed of Mach 0.75 to release Drone-6. A solid rocket booster motor is attached at the end of engine, with output power at 70.5 t/s, with sustaining time of 3.5 to 4.7 seconds. At an altitude of 8 km, the thrust of CF-03B ramjet is 2018 kg and propels Drone-6 to Mach 2.2. At an altitude of 20 km, the thrust of CF-03B is 446 kg and propels Drone-6 to Mach 2.5. Drone-6 is usually launched at an altitude of 9.3 km. Obviously, such speeds are too slow to simulate SR-71, and this was one of the primary reasons the Drone-6 project was finally cancelled. Although failing to fulfill the mission of simulating SR-71, Drone-6 was used in extremely limited application is support of developing other SAMs, mainly because there was nothing else to replace it, as a result of political turmoil in China at the time, namely, Cultural Revolution, which also prevented later plans to improve CF-03B ramjet from being carried out. Design was completed in 1967 by BUAA and the first batch consisted three units, one for static testing, one for payload testing on Xi'an H-6, and the remaining for actual test flight, and the maiden flight was completed in September 1969. Four more units were subsequently completed in 1970. Drone-6 is designed to be air-launched by Xi‚Äôan H-6 and recovered by parachute.

BUAA Tiltrotor UAV is a twin engine UAV in conventional layout with twin tails. Propulsion is provided by a pair of propeller driven piston engines with one mounted in the midpoint of each wing. Unlike most tiltrotor aircraft, the wing of BUAA tiltrotor cannot be completely tilted, but instead, only the engine and the out portion of the wing can be tilted to up to ninety degrees during take-off and landing for VSTOL take-off, and the inner portion of the each wing is fixed and cannot be tilted. The rotor/engine would tilt back to the position in line with the inner portion of the wing during flight to achieve normal flight of fixed wing aircraft.BUAA Tiltwing See also List of unmanned aerial vehicles of the People's Republic of China References Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles of China ","title":"BUAA VSTOL UAV"},{"id":"42751005","text":"BUAA unmanned helicopters are Chinese UAVs developed by Beihang University (BUAA), some of which have entered service with the Chinese military and government establishments. Falcon Hawk The Falcon Hawk (Sun Ying or Sunying, ) is an unmanned helicopter in conventional helicopter layout with a pair of skids as landing gear, and it is designed for various missions such as crop dusting, aerial surveying, phototopography and cinematography. The helicopter made its public debut on November 6, 2004, when it won the first place in the rotary wing category in the ‚ÄúFlying Leopard Cup‚Äù (Fei-Bao Bei or Feibaobei, ) Aerial Robotic Competition. The Falcon Hawk differs from later models developed by BUAA in that it lacks the aerodynamic fairing later models have. The model is no longer marketed, and has since been replaced by more advanced UAV models. F-120 The F-120 is also an unmanned helicopter in conventional helicopter layout with a pair of skids as landing gear, and it was designed for the same missions as the Falcon Hawk: crop dusting, aerial surveying, phototopography and cinematography. The helicopter has the following specifications: *Rotor diameter: *Height: *Length: *Empty weight: *Payload + fuel: *Endurance: 2hr *Range: *Max speed: *Cruising speed: *Ceiling: *Temperature: *Engine: gasoline engine FH-1 The FH-1 is an unmanned coaxial helicopter developed by BUAA, and it shares the same airframe with another Chinese unmanned helicopter, the TTA FH-1. As a result, the dimensions and performance of both unmanned helicopters are similar. However, the BUAA FH-1 has slightly larger main rotors and is 20% heavier than the TTA FH-1, and thus has a lower operational ceiling and slower maximum speed, despite its engine being 50% more powerful than that of the TTA FH-1. The maximum wind speed allowed for operation is also lower for the BUAA FH-1 than the TTA FH-1. The extreme similarity between the two unmanned helicopters is the result of BUAA selling its design to other Chinese UAV manufacturers to produce. In some instances, these Chinese UAV manufacturers developed their own design by making modifications to the original BUAA design. TTA's FH-1 is one of these modified versions of the BUAA design. Specifications: *Main rotor diameter: *Height: *Length: *Empty weight: *Payload + fuel: *Fuel: *Max take- off weight: *Endurance: 2hr with fuel, 2.6hr with fuel, and 3.3hr with fuel *Range @ : with fuel, with fuel, and with fuel *Max speed: *Cruising speed: *Ceiling: *Engine: two gasoline engines *Rate of climb: *Max wind speed allowed for operation: in flight, during take-off and landing FH-2 The FH-2 unmanned helicopter is a small UAV in conventional helicopter layout with a pair of skids as landing gear. The FH-2 has a modular design that allows different payloads to be carried, and for blades of different sizes to be used for its main rotor. Specifications: *Rotor diameter: or *Rotor blades: 2 *Height: *Length: *Width: *Distance between skids: *Empty weight: *Max take- off weight: *Max payload: *Endurance: 1 hr with payload, 2 hr with payload *Range: *Max speed: *Cruising speed: *Ceiling: *Temperature: *Engine: two- stroke gasoline motorcycle engine *Max wind speed allowed for operation: in flight, during take-off and landing M-18 Gull I The M-18 Gull (Hai-Ou or Haiou, ) I is an unmanned coaxial helicopter developed by BUAA, and its maiden flight was successfully completed in January 1996. The Gull I has twin tails, and also uses a pair of skids as landing gear. Externally, it resembles another Chinese unmanned coaxial helicopter, the PAPEI Sky Eye 2. The flight control system is a strap-down system developed by NUAA, which is shared by another unmanned coaxial helicopter developed by BUAA, the M-22 (described below). The M-18 is intended for aerial survey, photography and cinematography. Specifications: *Weight: *Engine: gasoline engine M-22 The M-22 is an unmanned coaxial helicopter developed by BUAA that resembles a miniature version of the much larger Kamov Ka-137. Like the FH-2, the M-22 is modular, with many interchangeable subsystems, such as different rotor sizes that can be used for the two pairs of rotors. When greater endurance is required, some of the payload modules can be removed to make room for more fuel modules, and when larger payloads are needed, fuel tank modules can be removed to make room for a larger payload section. The flight control system is a strap-down system developed by NUAA, which it shares with the earlier M-18. Specifications: *Rotor diameter: *Height: *Length: *Empty weight: *Max fuel: *Max weight: *Max payload: *Endurance: 1 hr *Range: *Max speed: with payload, without payload *Cruising speed: *Ceiling: *Temperature: *Engine: Two or two-stroke gasoline motorcycle engines *Max wind speed allowed for operation: in flight, for take-off and landing MH-28 Gull II The MH-28 Gull II is the successor of the MH-18, and shares its airframe with another Chinese unmanned helicopter, the Yotaisc M28 Honey Bee 28. The performances of the two are extremely similar, differing only in their ground control systems, which are independently developed by their two companies. The MH-28 ground control station consists of two laptop computers, one for mission planning and the other for payload control and image processing. Compared to the M28, the MH-28 has a slightly larger main rotor, can fly higher, and has more endurance. Specifications: *Rotor diameter: *Height: *Fuselage width: *Empty weight: *Fuel: *Max take-off weight: *Max payload: *Endurance: 3‚Äì5 h *Max speed: *Cruising speed: *Economy speed: *Ceiling: *Rate of climb: Quadrotor The BUAA quadrotor is a quadcopter developed by the School of Instrumentation Science and Opto-Electronics Engineering () of BUAA. The general designer is Mr. Hu Jun, and the UAV is primarily intended for aerial surveillance and photography missions. Its flight control system (FCS) is controlled by Atmel ATmega16 microcontrollers, and includes three gyroscopes. For fully autonomous flight, GPS and OSD modules are used. This UAV is specifically designed as a low-cost unit, performing the same tasks as other quadcopters for 50% of the cost. The quadcopter can be remotely piloted or fully autonomous.

These bits of folklore, combined with archaeological written records, allude to what was likely a ‚Äúthriving oral culture of contraception.‚ÄùOral Contraceptives in Ancient and Medieval Times John M. Riddle and J. Worth Estes, American Scientist . Vol. 80, No. 3 (May‚ÄìJune 1992) , pp. 226-233 Published by: Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society. Silphium was a plant that grew in the hills near the Greek city-state of Cyrene, Libya, located in North Africa. This plant was one example of an oral contraceptive in ancient times, based partly on Pliny's statement that it could be used \\"to promote the menstrual discharge\\"Did the ancient Romans use a natural herb for birth control?, Straight Dope, 13 October 2006. Physical Contraceptive Barriers The ancient philosopher Aristotle wrote in The History of Animals VII, part 3 (350 B.C.E) that to avoid conception women must prevent the \\"womb\\" from coming in contact with the male sperm by rubbing it with cedar oil, lead ointment or incense, mixed with olive oil. The lead ointment was highly toxic, but the oil was proven to decreased sperm mobility by Marie Stopes in the 1930s. Around 300 AD saw the introduction of the contraceptive sponge which was inserted into the vagina, so as to prevent conception by absorbing the semen. An Indian prevention recipe from the 8th Century has survived throughout time. The cervical opening was brushed with a mixture of honey and ghee and is then rubbed or mixed with oil rock salt and used to physically block semen. The sticky honey likely reduced sperm motility, and rock salt is now regarded as a spermicide. The works of Iranian author Ibn Sina (980-1037), also known as Avicenna, has shown to have had 20 different contraceptives in his medical encyclopedia. Behaviors While physical methods of contraception were likely present due to their presence and referencing in historical texts, there are also some purposeful behaviors thought to be utilized in preventing unwanted pregnancy. These methods could have been used either out of personal preference, or with heavy influence from religion. Likely the most common used and easiest to hide from the church at the time was coitus. = Coitus interruptus = Coitus interruptus is an example of a contraceptive behavior utilized in Medieval times. This is the case with onanism, which is clearly distinguished from masturbation. In the biblical telling, Onan was unwilling to procreate with Tamar, so he withdrew before climax and ‚Äúspilled his seed on the ground‚Äù.Sex Education in Medieval Christianity.Vern L. Bullough The Journal of Sex Research, Vol. 13, No. 3 (Aug., 1977), pp. 185-196 Published by: Taylor & Francis, Ltd.

It was first released in 1964. Background At the time it was written many Jamaicans had a fascination with films from Hollywood, particularly gangster and Western films. Al Capone, the American gangster from the 1920s and 1930s, held a particular interest for Jamaican listeners. Primarily an instrumental, the song starts with the sound of a car crash, gun fire and squealing tyres. Buster's backing group, the All Stars, provide jazzy horns while piano playing keeps the rhythm. The recording session included Dennis Campbell and Val Bennett on tenor saxophones, Raymond Harper and Baba Brooks on trumpets, Junior Nelson on trombone, Ernest Ranglin on guitar and bass, Jah Jerry Haynes on guitar, Gladstone Anderson on piano and Drumbago (Arkland \\"Drumbago\\" Parks) on drums. The few lyrics are provided by Buster in an MC style. AllMusic credits the song with giving a sense of attitude to the 2 Tone movement and as such, it was sampled by the Specials in their 1979 song \\"Gangsters\\". The B side was \\"One Step Beyond\\", also released on the 2 Tone label in 1979, by Madness. \\"Al Capone\\", when heard by a 15-year-old Suggs, had provided him with inspiration which later went towards the formation of Madness of which he was lead singer. Chart success It was not until 1967 that the song became a hit for Prince Buster, making number 18 in the UK charts and staying for 13 weeks. It was a crossover success as British youth saw the image of Jamaicans wearing sunglasses and dressed in a rude boy style as iconic.

It was first published in 2001 as a serialized story that ran in the Boston Globe and was later published in book format on August 1, 2003 through Atheneum Books. The work centers upon a young boy that discovers that although he doesn't identify as racist or discriminatory, he does have deep-seated and unconscious prejudices that prompt him to immediately suspect the worst about a black student at his school. Clements based the book's premise around a similar situation that occurred in his life, where his brother mistakenly believed that an African-American boy had stolen his jacket and confronted him over the theft. Since its release, the book has been utilized in classrooms as a way to illustrate different types of racism. When Phil sees another kid wearing his brother's jacket, he assumes the jacket was stolen. It turns out he was wrong, and Phil has to ask himself the question: Would he have made the same assumption if the boy wearing the jacket hadn't been African American? And that question leads to others that reveal some unsettling truths about Phil's neighborhood, his family, and even himself.

And that question leads to others that reveal some unsettling truths about Phil's neighborhood, his family, and even himself. Synopsis Schoolboy Phil has never viewed himself as racist, but he's forced to rethink his stance when he accuses Daniel of stealing an imported jacket. Daniel, who is African- American, was given the jacket as a gift by his grandmother, who works for Phil's mother as a housekeeper and had received the jacket as a hand-me-down. Phil immediately begins to rethink his actions, wondering if he would have treated the situation differently if Daniel had been white instead of black. Tortured by self-doubt, Phil looks at his immediate surroundings and is saddened when he realizes that he has likely been influenced by his father, who is openly bigoted.

This was the first feature film appearance of Hayakawa and the directorial debut of Barker. The film is based on an American sailor who comes to the Yamaki family after his ship is wrecked in the ocean. The sailor (Borzage) falls in love with the daughter (Aoki) of the family, unaware of the fact that she is cursed by God, such that if she marries, a nearby volcano will erupt and destroy the entire island on which the family lives. Writer and producer Thomas H. Ince got the idea for the film from the volcanic eruption on the island of Sakura-Jima in 1914. Hayakawa was paid $500 a week, the highest paid of all oriental stars at the time. Filming started on January 27, 1914 and was completed on February 13. The film was released to a warm reception on June 7 after a large-scale publicity campaign. The visual effects of the film were widely appreciated by critics. It premiered in Japan on 15 September 1918, where it was later banned for \\"bringing dishonor to the country\\". Hayakawa, who played Aoki's father in the film, married her before the film's premiere.  Plot  Baron Yamaki (Sessue Hayakawa) is a fisherman who lives along with his daughter Toya San (Tsuru Aoki) on an island. The island is inhabited by Buddhists and Yamaki had been cursed by Buddha for an affront by one of his ancestors who, in a murderous rage, defiled an altar of Buddha in the nearby temple. The curse was that if his daughter married anyone, then the nearby volcano would erupt. Toya finds it difficult to form relationships with boys because the village prophet Takeo (Thomas Kurihara) has spread the rumour that she is cursed. She is therefore unwilling to continue her father's acceptance of the curse. When Yamaki takes Toya-san to the Buddha shrine in the garden of his house to pray and try to get the curse removed, she vents her feelings about the god's unfairness. An American sailor, Tom Wilson (Frank Borzage), whose ship has been wrecked in a storm, comes to them for help and shelter. Wilson falls in love with Toya and teaches her about Christianity. To the consternation of her father, Toya decides to convert and marry Tom at the local Japanese-American mission. However, her father also converts. The locals, who have been stirred up by Takeo, go on a murderous rampage against the family. They first go to the chapel but the newlyweds evade them and so they go to the beach house instead. When the mob reaches his house, Yamaki throws out the Buddha statue he had set up in his house and puts a cross in its place. The villagers are infuriated by this; they beat him to death beneath the cross and burn his house. Eventually, the volcano erupts and the village is destroyed, and Takeo dies in an avalanche. Only Tom Wilson and Toya San survive. They are taken away from the destroyed village by a United States merchant vessel. At the end of the film, Tom tells his bride, \\"Your gods may be powerful, Toya San, but mine has proved his omnipotence. You are saved to perpetuate your race.\\"  Cast  * Sessue Hayakawa as Lord Yamaki * Tsuru Aoki as Toya San * Frank Borzage as Tom Wilson * Thomas Kurihara as Takeo * Henry Kotani as Mr. Hoshida  Production  Sessue Hayakawa and Tsuru Aoki in The Wrath of the Gods The prophet at the Christian church On 12 January 1914, a volcano erupted on the island of Sakura-Jima in Kagoshima prefecture, in the southern part of Japan. It was one of the biggest disasters in the history of Japan. Producer Thomas H. Ince immediately decided to make a film based on the incident. The Toledo Blade reported on 24 January 1914 that \\"News of the eruption was hardly a day old before Mr. Ince had built in Santa Monica canyon a whole Japanese village\\". Ince had constructed a very large village in his studio Inceville in Culver City, California, and decided, where possible, to use Japanese people instead of Americans as extras. He gathered workers from the Southern California who were to work as peasants in the film. Approximately 1,000, mostly Japanese, extras were used. The film's shooting began on 27 January 1914, just 15 days after the eruption ceased. Actress Enid Markey was \\"badly injured\\" during the production; during her scene in which the lava flow destroys the village she was surrounded by smoke and fumes and nearly asphyxiated, but had recovered by May 1914. Six reels were used to film it in total. To help publicize the production, Ince reported to the newspapers that lead-actress Tsuru Aoki was a native of the island of Sakura and she had lost all her relatives in the eruption‚Äîshe was actually from Obara Tsuru city, Kyushu, 180 miles north of Sakura-Jima. Ince also embroidered her biography so that she would appeal to the middle-class audiences as the heroine of a melodrama, claiming that she was the daughter of an illustrious Japanese artist. The biographical-type publicity added emotional and psychological authenticity to the character that Aoki played in the film. Sessue Hayakawa, Aoki's soon-to-be husband, played her father in the film; they married on May 1 just before the film's release. Hayakawa was paid $500 a week and, seeing another chance to publicize his production, Ince stated that Hayakawa was \\"the highest paid of all oriental stars.\\" The film's shipwreck scene was shot off the coast of Santa Monica, and an erupting volcano was also included among its lavish effects. This was the first feature film appearance of Hayakawa and the directorial debut of Barker.  Publicity and release  Targeted at the middle class, a large-scale publicity campaign was organized by the New York Motion Picture Corporation. Four months prior to the release, New York Motion Picture Corporation put an advertisement in the 14 February 1914 edition of the New York Clipper, announcing: \\"Wait for The Wrath of the Gods.\\" Major journals carried full-page advertisements of the film every week with pictures, various ad lines and photographs taken on the film set. An advertisement of the film featured an angry looking statue of Buddha and a young woman in a kimono praying in front of it. The marriage of the lead actors Tsuru Aoki and Sessue Hayakawa was also included in the publicity campaign. The film was released in a new theater called The Strand, on 7 June 1914. Variety noted that \\"special and incidental music was written by Joseph Littau, pianist of the orchestra there. The stage [at the Strand] was given a Japanesy air and atmosphere by the management.\\" The Wrath of the Gods was purported to have attracted 21,000 spectators when Marcus Loew screened it along with a vaudeville bill at the opening of his summertime evening entertainment at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn.The New York Times (23 June 1914), page-11.  Reception  Fleeing villagers from the erupting volcano The erupting volcano, the effects of which were highly praised by critics The film was well received by critics, particularly for its visual effects, especially the volcano eruption scene. An advertisement for the film in the Williamsport Sun-Gazette stated \\"Nothing like the \\"Wrath of God\\" has ever been seen. Pandemonium. Thrilling. Superb.\\" The Reading Times called the film a \\"genuine masterpiece\\", stating that it contained \\"the greatest volcano scenes ever filmed\\" at the time. The New York Critics also hailed the film as a masterpiece, and the Brooklyn Daily Eagle considered it to be the best film of 1914. The Washington Post wrote that the \\"scenic effects obtained are especially picturesque, a volcano in full action becoming the central sensation\\". The Chicago Daily Tribune called the film \\"impressive\\", and spoke of the \\"scenic splendor\\" and the \\"vigorous beauty of the outdoor settings\\". True Republican wrote that \\"In the motion picture field [the film] was greater than The Darling of the Gods in drama, or Madame Butterfly in opera.\\" It also wrote that the volcanic eruption and typhoon scenes \\"can never be obliterated from the mind.\\" The film was praised for its happy ending even though the Aoki's character lost her village. Critic Gina Marchetti proposed in her book Tragic and Transcendent Love in the Forbidden City that the film was \\"simultaneously warning against miscegenation while celebrating romantic love.\\" The lead actress Tsuru Aoki's acting was also highly appreciated for adding \\"the sense of naturalness to the archetypal narrative between Japan and the United States.\\" However, in Japan the lead actors Hayakawa and Aoki were considered insults to the country. The Japanese film critics labeled the film \\"Anti-Japanese\\" for portraying the country and its people in a primitive manner. The film premiered in Asakusa's Fujikan Theater on September 15, 1918 but was banned a few weeks later for bringing \\"dishonour to the country\\". The father Yamaki sacrifices himself in order to cut all ties between her daughter and Japan hoping that she would be protected by Tom and his Christian God. While referring to the film in particular, the film theorist Kaeriyama Norimasa said \\"Isn't it a huge loss that Japanese producers don't make any film for export and have all the greatly unique landscape of Japan by foreigners?\\" Daisuke Miyao, in The Oxford Handbook of Japanese Cinema, states that the film and its narrative of a religion collision \\"emphasize the difficulty for a Japanese woman to become submissive to Christianity and the American family system\\", stating that the film is first and foremost \\"an archetypal fable pitting the civilized West, embodied by an American sailor, against the primitive East, embodied by the Japanese woman, told as a religious battle between Buddhism and Christianity\\".

He is often identified as Irish: his background was certainly Irish, but in the 19th century his own version of his background, that he was born in Paris, was widely accepted.Francis Arthur Fahy and David James O'Donoghue, Ireland in London (1889) p. 151; archive.org. Eugenius Roche, 1830 engraving after a drawing from 1824 by William Home Clift Early life Roche was born on 23 February 1786 in Paris, where his father who educated him was professor of modern languages in the √âcole Militaire. At age 18 he went to London, where he began work as a journalist. Journalist In 1807 Roche started a periodical Monthly Literary Recreations, for Ben Crosby, then Lord Byron's publisher. It was not a financial success, but published Byron, Allan Cunningham, and other poets. Cunningham wrote in it as \\"Hidallan\\": Roche offered to make him a partner in the publication, but was turned down. Another contributor was Thomas Gaspey. In 1808 Roche began The Dramatic Appellant, a quarterly journal whose object was to print rejected plays of the period; it was not a conspicuous success. In 1809 Roche became parliamentary reporter of The Day, of which he was appointed editor the same year. His reporting position was filled by Vincent George Dowling. The poet Peter Lionel Courtier became a prot√©g√© of Roche's, and followed him to his later publications. The Day was highly complimentary in 1810 about the integrity of Spencer Perceval, Prime Minister from October 1809, and very understanding about the financial panic of 29 September of that year, caused by the suicide of the financier Abraham Goldsmid. While editing it, however, Roche was sentenced to a year's imprisonment in the Marshalsea Prison, in 1811, for an attack on the government over the case of Sir Francis Burdett. The charge was seditious libel; Roche argued that he had not seen the offending material. The language used included the phrase \\"wanton desire of shedding blood\\", of soldiers dispersing crowds when Burdett was being taken to the Tower of London, enough to convict the proprietors of The Day even at a time when the judicial attitude to libels was softening.Michael Lobban, From Seditious Libel to Unlawful Assembly: Peterloo and the Changing Face of Political Crime c.1770‚Äì1820, Oxford Journal of Legal Studies Vol. 10, No. 3 (Autumn, 1990), pp. 307‚Äì352, at pp. 326‚Äì327, Published by: Oxford University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/764345 On his release Roche became editor of the National Register, a weekly paper. He sold it to the √©migr√© Jacques Regnier; but Regnier had serious financial difficulties, and they affected Roche also. In August 1813 he accepted a position on The Morning Post, becoming its subeditor, a position he held from 1817 to 1827, under Nicholas Byrne. Roche edited the New Times 1827‚Äì8, as successor to its founder John Stoddart. He then edited The Courier 1828‚Äì9, after William Mudford had been removed for his support of George Canning. Death and legacy Roche died, heavily in debt, on 9 November 1829 in Hart Street, Bloomsbury. His obituary in Fraser's Magazine described the circumstances: he had paid heavily for a small share in The Courier, and had remarried about 18 months before. No support from the government could be expected. Frederick Knight Hunt gave a different version, the debts being associated to those of the New Times, into which he had bought, and secured against the freehold of his house. Works In the Dramatic Appellant were two of Roche's own dramas, \\"William Tell\\" and \\"The Invasion\\". The former was a dark-toned melodrama, based on the version of the William Tell story in Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian's rendition. It was being rehearsed when Drury Lane Theatre was destroyed by fire on 24 February 1809. A sum was subscribed for Roche's widow (second wife) and family, and his poems were collected and published by subscription, with a memoir and portrait, as London in a Thousand Years (1830). The title poem, a long work touched by apocalyptic thought, has been described as \\"not so much a Last Man narrative as a promenade among ruins\\". Family In 1809 Roche married Mary Jane Oliver, who died in 1827. His second wife was also from the Oliver family: he left her a widow, with nine children, one being her own. The sons included the barrister Henry Philip Roche. Another son was Alfred R. Roche (died 1876), in business and a figure of Canadian history, who was the first secretary of the Colonial Society, and husband of Harriet A. Roche the writer.

G.M. (eds.) (2009). \\"Popular Culture and Literature\\" , p. 907. Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals, 2nd edition. Academic Press. Early life A native of San Bernardino County, California Nelson began creating murals, sculptures, landscapes, seascapes, and experimenting with still life early in his life. When he was 15, his ninth grade history teacher, David Radcliff, recognizing Nelson's talent, gave him a permanent library pass and allowed him to do independent study. He was to focus on the art of the period of history the class was studying and make sketches - Greek and Roman artwork and notes on the specific art created during that period. In addition Nelson (Bob, as he was then known), did his own independent library work where he discovered Johan Berthold Jongkind and copied Jongkind's famous Windmills of Rotterdam. He also executed a series of Rembrandt van Rijn portraits. Nelson completed that study successfully, something no other student in Radcliff's more than three decades of teaching was ever able to do.Letter to Maui Arts & Cultural Center from David Radcliff October 2016 He attended Chaffey High School in Ontario, CaliforniaMarquez, Liset (11 November 2011). \\"Ontario council honors artist, performer for their achievements\\" . Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (Ontario, California). Retrieved 2014-09-11 ‚Äì via HighBeam Research . and won a scholarship to attend classes at Chaffey College at age thirteen. As a teenager he began exhibiting his paintings (his first show sold out) at a series of one-man shows and group shows in Southern California. Nelson completed four years of art training at Chaffey College and Mt. San Antonio College, he was offered a full scholarship to continue his studies at the San Francisco Academy of Arts. Artistic career Nelson moved to Hawaii when he was eighteen years old. According to Nelson, the turning point in his life and his career occurred when he encountered a group of whales while surfing off Lahaina, Hawaii. \\"In learning to ride the waves, I also learned to respect the ocean...to feel its pulse with all five of my senses, and to feel its spirit at an extra-sensory level. It was a blend of magic and realism that I wanted to communicate in my paintings,\\" says Nelson. Inspired by this \\"overwhelming experience\\", he came up with the idea of painting above- and below-water scenes on the same canvas. It was there that he began painting Hawaiian landscapes and seascapes. When he was twenty-two years old, he moved from Oahu to Maui. He spent a great deal of time surfing, kayaking and scuba diving in Maui, while continuing to paint and study the landscape of the Hawaiian Islands. Nelson grew a business around his art, Robert Lyn Nelson Studios, which was worth $5 million by the mid-1990s. He used commercial advertising in print, on radio and television to promote his paintings. Nelson's painting From Sea to Shining Sea was exhibited at the U.S. Pavilion at the 1998 World Expo in Lisbon, Portugal. From March to October 2001, the work was displayed at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in a solo exhibition along with several of his other paintings. A nationwide tour sponsored by the National Marine Sanctuary System took place following this exhibition. He has produced and donated paintings to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. His painting Rainforests of the Sea was reproduced as the poster for the International Year of the Reef in 1997. That same year he was one of four Hawaiians to receive NOAA's Local Environmental Hero award.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (26 April 1997). Style The creator of \\"Two Worlds Environmental Surrealist School of Painting,\\" where the viewer sees simultaneously what is above and below the ocean's surface - a new school of fine art. Seeing a group of whales while surfing off the coast of Lahaina, Maui, inspired him to develop the \\"Two World\\" concept. He is best known for his marine painting, however, and he has created more than 9,000 original works of art in a range of styles and techniques. His first painting in the Two Worlds Environmental style, was created in 1979 and is called Two Worlds. According to Nelson, \\"It is a visionary fantasy - more surrealism than realism.\\" In this work he has \\"selectively shown some of Lahaina ªs historic buildings, but the perspective and multiple light source are imaginary. In the real ocean you lose the whole spectrum of color when you get below thirty feet.\\"Nelson, Robert Lyn Artists Choice 1994 Two Worlds \\"So exciting was the concept in both perspective and personal style, that imitators quickly arose\\", says gallery owner Jim Killett. \\"Nelson perfected the two worlds concept, made it popular, and in the course, spawned dozens of mimics including a few who are generally interested in bringing something good to the genre. The difference, of course, is that Nelson is the only artist who didn't have to learn to paint like Robert Lyn Nelson.\\" References External links * * Video interview with Robert Lyn Nelson at the Smithsonian Institution on the official YouTube channel of RealPopStudio * Nelson's profile at National Marine Sanctuary Foundation.

The church is South Africa's oldest place of Christian worship, built by Herman Schuette in 1841. The first church on this land was built in 1678. Willem Adriaan van der Stel laid the cornerstone for the church. It was replaced by the present building in 1841, but the original tower was retained. The pulpit is the work of Anton Anreith and the carpenter Jacob Graaff, and was inaugurated on 29 November 1789. The Groote Kerk lays claim to housing South Africa's largest organ, which was installed in 1954 and has 5917 pipes.  Background  At first the colonists, landing beginning in 1652 at the Cape of Good Hope, relied on a lay preacher (sieketrooster, Dutch for \\"comforter of the ill\\") named Willem Wylant. He regularly preached in the Fort, taught children, and evangelized to natives. The first communion was held on May 12, 1652, by a visiting pastor, the Rev. Johannes Backerus, while the first baptism was held on August 24, 1653. Other sieketroosters who served the community were Pieter van der Stael, Ernestus Back, and Jan Joris Graaf.  Early pastors  The small congregation longed for its own preacher, until the Lords Seventeen of the Dutch East India Company in Amsterdam decided to send the first full-time pastor to the Cape. He was Joan van Arckel, who landed at Table Bay on August 18, 1665. During his tenure, he used a wooden church that was supplied in December of that same year with a stone gable and floor. In 1672, services began to be held in \\"De Kat\\" (Afrikaans for \\"The Cat\\"), a section of the Castle of Good Hope, since the foundations of the first church building would not be laid until 1678. On January 6, 1704, the first stone church opened with a service by the Rev. Petrus Kalden. Construction cost ¬£2,200. The first Afrikaner (i.e. local-born) pastor of the congregation was the Rev. Petrus van der Spuy (1746-1752). During the tenure of the Rev. Johannes Petrus Serrurier (1760-1802), the 1704 church was slated for expansion. This was completed at a cost of 4,000 and opened in 1781. The current pulpit, made from the best Indian wood at the cost of ¬£708 by the sculptor Anton Anreith, was unveiled in November 1789. Later, the building was damaged, and the current Groote Kerk was opened in 1841. One of the most famous pastors in the congregation's history was the Rev. Abraham Faure, who served the congregation from 1822 to 1867. He showed particular interest in education, and his efforts were instrumental to founding the first local Sunday school in 1844. Another famous 19th-century pastor was Dr. William Robertson (Scottish minister), who came here from Swellendam.  Large church, small congregation  Some of the neighborhoods got their own ministers and therefore separate congregations: Three Anchor Bay Reformed Church (in Sea Point), Observatory Reformed Church, Woodstock Reformed Church, and Maitland Reformed Church, while the Table Mountain Reformed Church was spun off from the Tamboerskloof Reformed Church (also called the New Church). As Afrikaners have left the area, the daughter congregations have tended to decline in number. Woodstock latter dissolved, and in 2007, Three Anchor Bay, Observatory, Maitland, and Tamboerskloof had only 659 members among all four congregations combined, down to 646 in 2008, compared to 1,816 for them plus Woodstock in 1985. In 1952, celebrated as the congregation's tricentennial (later, the foundation was more correctly rendered as 1665), there were more than 2,000 members served by three pastors in the mother church. In 1979, there were still 1,971 adult members, but by 1995 that number had shrunk to 1,403, and by 2009 it reached a mere 810. At the end of 2014 it had declined to 585.

Mitch talks to Claire (Julie Bowen), who informs him that their mother will not be attending the wedding because of a hip injury she sustained during a yoga retreat. Later on, while getting ready, Cam finds out that the dry-cleaners gave him the wrong tuxedo and tells Mitch that they need to go to the dry-cleaners to pick up a new one.

Claire discovers that she has been distant with Luke and does not know what is going on with him so she decides to take him boating, but they soon get stuck in the middle of the lake. Alex and Phil arrive at the mall after Phil's appointment with the eye doctor, which temporarily reduces his sight, leaving him barely able to see. Despite needing to get the wedding present, Phil is constantly distracted by items in other shops and wants to have fun. When they finally get to the shop that sells the wedding present, the line is already too long and Phil decides to pretend to be blind so he can get the present faster. When he gets to the front of the line, the salesman confronts Phil, accuses him of faking being blind, and pretends to give Phil the present Claire had ordered - instead giving him the same item in the wrong color. Alex gets in the way, telling the salesman her father lost his sight defending America and suffers from a rare condition that affects his sight. The salesman apologizes and hands Phil the right present. Cameron's parents, Merle (Barry Corbin) and Barb (Celia Weston), stay at Jay's (Ed O'Neill) house for the wedding and have really quiet 'arguments' from time to time. Barb soon starts to talk to Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) about it and Gloria encourages her to take action to fix their relationship by telling Merle what bothers her. At the same time, Merle and Jay go for a day spa to relax before the wedding and Merle talks to Jay about the same thing. Just as Gloria did with Barb, Jay advises Merl to fix the relationship. After Merle and Jay meet with Gloria and Barb at the wedding, Barb and Merle have another argument and decide to end their marriage. Andy (Adam DeVine) has to catch a flight to Utah to meet his girlfriend, but he is panicking because his taxi for the airport has not arrived and he needs someone to drive him. Gloria asks Haley (Sarah Hyland) to help and, despite saying that she does not want to do it, she agrees. On their way to the airport, Andy receives a text from the airline company that informs him that the flight is delayed for three hours. Having nothing to do, Andy and Haley go out for a coffee where Haley tells him that while reading the airline company text message, she also saw a text from his girlfriend telling him to not go to Utah because their relationship is over. Andy says that Beth always does that but she does not mean it, and that everything will be fine once he gets there. =Part 2= It is Mitch and Cam's big day, but their wedding is interrupted by the firefighters who ask them to evacuate the area immediately because of an approaching wildfire. Pepper manages to convince the firefighters to give them half an hour so they can finish the wedding, but just as Mitch and Cam are about to get married, celebrant Sal's water breaks and she needs to get to the hospital, leaving Cam and Mitch with nobody to marry them. Phil volunteers to do it, but the firefighters return, demanding that everyone immediately evacuate because the wildfire's approach has accelerated. Pepper finds another wedding venue available, but the wedding is interrupted again by the couple who had originally booked the venue for the day. The wedding is moved, this time to Mitch and Cam's apartment, but the apartment gets too crowded and half the guests have to stand outside on the lawn. Remembering an earlier comment from Jay that all of these problems may be signs from God that they should not get married, Cam wonders if the entire \\"mess\\" is indeed a sign and that the wedding should not happen. Left with no other choice, Cam and Mitch decide to cancel the wedding. When Mitch starts making an announcement to the guests to inform them of the wedding's cancellation, he gets interrupted by Jay who tells him that they can not have their big wedding day in their apartment. Mitch expects this to be another indication that Jay has mixed feelings about the wedding, but instead Jay reveals that he has booked his country club as the perfect wedding venue and is proud that his son is marrying Cam. Jay and Gloria walk Mitch down the aisle, followed by Barb and Merle with Cam. As a voiceover during the ceremony, we hear Claire's 'best person' speech at the reception, thanking the man who will protect and love her brother just as much as she does. Meanwhile, Jay and Gloria feel responsible for the impending dissolution of Merle and Barb's marriage and are determined to fix it. While traveling between wedding venues on a school bus, Jay talks to Barb about Merle and discovers that Barb found a flask of liquor in his coat (which he has previously loaned her), and is now drunk. Gloria talks to Merle about Barb as well, telling him a story about how lonely he will feel if he ends the marriage with his beloved. Later, Merle and Barb have another argument but when they walk their son down the aisle, they both seem happy once more. Alex observes that Haley's actions show that she has a crush on Andy, but Haley refuses to admit it. However, when they arrive at the venue that is close to the cafe where Andy is waiting for his flight, Haley goes to find him and to talk to him about his girlfriend. She tells him that he is able to get a better girlfriend than Beth, who does not deserve him, using examples of her own previous treatment of boys to show him how Beth is not treating him well. Haley quickly leaves as she gets a call from her mother, but she later receives a call from Andy who asks if she was referring to someone in particular earlier. Haley refuses to admit that by \\"someone better\\" she meant herself, so Andy, who took a cab and came to the wedding to find her, does not say he is there, and he leaves. Luke and Manny wonder if it is difficult to officiate a marriage, so they ask Phil who says that it's not, and he demonstrates what he is required to say. While doing so, Luke and Manny inadvertently appear to be a bridal couple, saying the \\"I do\\" parts and unknowingly making it look like a real wedding, something that Alex records on her phone. Throughout the rest of the day, Luke and Manny constantly argue, which Alex finds amusing since they appear to be acting like a married couple. This continues until after Cam and Mitch have left for their honeymoon. Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"The Wedding (Part 1)\\" was watched by 9.08 million; up by 0.53 from the previous episode. \\"The Wedding (Part 2)\\" was watched by 10.45 million; up by 1.37 from the previous episode. The episode was the show's most viewed episode finale out of all five seasons. Critical reception =Part 1= \\"The Wedding (Part 1)\\" received mixed reviews. Joshua Alston of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating, stating that the episode \\"is a pretty good one, albeit one that hangs a lot of funny lines on a flimsy frame\\". He further went on to say \\"But this is part one, a fact the title calls attention to, so it‚Äôs necessary to grant the episode a generous amount of leeway. Especially because its as dense with jokes as it is with story, and I laughed consistently, even as I questioned whether this will build to a satisfying conclusion\\". Michelle Carlbert of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.9/5, saying \\"this one it going to go down in the history of TV weddings as one of the most unlucky ever\\" and also laid praise on Cam and Mitchell's storyline. Jordan Adler of We Got This Covered gave the episode a positive review. He stated \\"Alas, this is only the first half of what could be a sterling season finale next week, so it is hard to give this episode a full grade. Some solid subplots and winning one-liners helped make the time fly, even though the pacing was cluttered, as usual for Modern Family. As a regular episode, it was strong. As the first-half of a pivotal special episode, it left you wanting more\\". Jeremy Peeples of Rant Lifestyle gave the episode a mixed review, saying: \\"As the first part of a two-part story, this was fine, but things were a bit predictable since you knew with it being a two-parter, the wedding wouldn‚Äôt happen here.\\" Peeples also criticized the gift story line and described it as a \\"C-level story\\", but admitted the scene where Alex sticks up for Phil was \\"touching\\". Victoria Leigh Miller of Yahoo TV gave the episode a mixed review, criticizing the fact Shelley Long's character did not appear at all, and said that the absence of the character \\"left more time for silly side story lines like Phil's (Ty Burrell) faux blindness after an eye doctor appointment ‚Äî seriously, who gets their eyes dilated on the morning of a major family wedding? ‚Äî and Lily's impromptu merry-go-round ride on a dry- cleaning conveyor.\\" =Part 2= \\"The Wedding Part 2\\" received mixed reviews. Joshua Alston from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating, praising the emotions that the writers brought in the episode. \\"[The] episode does a fine job with the emotional beats of Mitch and Cam‚Äôs wedding, finally dealing substantively with the rift between Jay and Mitch and giving Jay an opportunity to redeem himself.\\" Leigh Raines from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4/5 saying: \\"[The] best part though was when [Jay] told Mitchell, they should take a little walk...down the aisle. You're damn right I teared up when Jay and Gloria walked Mitchell down the aisle and Merle and Barb walked Cam down. That's the way it always should have been.\\" Jordan Adler of We Got This Covered gave the episode a negative review, saying \\"The main issue with this season finale was despite the double-episode length, it all felt cluttered and haphazard. The three writers who penned this episode (Megan Ganz, Christopher Lloyd and Dan O‚ÄôShannon) tried so hard to give all of the characters something to do that the large emotional pull felt crushed under the weight of satisfying a bunch of story-lines.\\" Adler also criticized how many story-lines were in the episode, saying \\"This episode is a lot of half-scenes, moments that feel trimmed so that every character can have a little story of his or her own.\\" For his performance in the episode, Nathan Lane was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.

Resin work was an occupation that largely died out in the 19th and 20th centuries, but it was sometimes a primary occupation as well as a secondary source of income. Resin was needed as a raw material in the manufacture of pitch, tar and terpentine.  Terminology  As well as the general term \\"resin worker\\", the terms resin burner and resin picker are also used in the literature. = France = In France, where the occupation was common, a resin picker was a gemmeur, whilst a resin worker was a r√©sinier. = Germany = In German-speaking lands, the general term was Harzer. Other names were Harzbrenner (\\"resin burner\\")Helmut Seebach: Altes Handwerk und Gewerbe in der Pfalz - Pf√§lzerwald, Annweiler- Qeichhambach, 1994, p.117ff in the Palatinate region and Pecher (\\"pitcher\\") in Lower Austria, or Pechler, Pechsieder, Harzeinsammler (\\"resin picker\\") and Harzscharrer (\\"resin scraper\\").Deutsches W√∂rterbuch, Jacob Grimm und Wilhelm Grimm, Leipzig: S. Hirzel 1854-1960, Harzer  Resin worker's craft  From ancient times resin was gathered from pines in the form of \\"living resin\\" (Lebendharzung). By removing bark from the tree trunk and cutting into the underlying wood, the tree was injured in order to tap into the resin that was exuded; it was then gathered and processed. Through this cutting and \\"bleeding\\", the wood of the tree became generally unusable for construction or other purposes. That was a reason why enmity existed between resin workers and foresters. To increase the yield, carbonizing ovens (Schwel√∂fen), known in the Palatine Forest as \\"resin ovens\\" (Harz√∂fen), were used. Using wood as a raw material, resinous pine wood (Kienholz) was turned into resin and pitch through a burning process. The burning of resin was sometimes strictly regulated in order to prevent the wanton damage of the forest. In the 19th century, larger and larger facilities were built to extract resin. In the Palatinate area of Germany, street and place names witness to the industry that went into decline in the 20th century e.g. Harzofen in Kaiserslautern and near Elmstein). Resin was gathered in this way in East Germany until the Wende in 1990.

It differs from other social networks and anonymous sharing apps in that it is primarily for reconnecting with former classmates using their yearbook photos.Classmates are kept exclusive to each other, with limited access to other school years. History Currently incorporated in Delaware, DYP was founded in Los Angeles, California by Robert Nunn, a former real estate broker and Samuel Zaribian, a former marketing consultant. Robert Nunn has said ‚Äúthe idea came to me when I was cleaning my closet and stumbled across my old high school yearbook.

The company raised $125k in seed funding in 2013. The app was released in the Apple Store on April 28, 2014, with plans of an Android version release in the works. Reception Technology commentators likened DYP to a High School version of Tinder and Facebook at its early stage. Notably, Yahoo News called DYP ‚ÄòA Facebook for Yearbooks‚Äô. Samuel Zaribian has emphasized in interviews that DYP is not trying to replace any social network or the printed yearbook and should be used as a tool for schools and publishers to sell more printed yearbooks in the digital era.

It was released on 7 December 2012 as the first single from their debut album, New Eyes. The song peaked at number 100 on the UK Singles Chart, but received mixed critical reception. The song's music video contains a CGI snake. Background The track was written by Jack Patterson while he was waiting for fellow band member Grace Chatto in the accident and emergency department of Whittington Hospital, North London. The track was originally released in 2012 as a double A-Side with \\"Nightingale\\". Both tracks feature Cislyn; only A&E; features Moore. The track was recorded in Clean Bandit's studio in South Kilburn, London. Moore and Cislyn were recruited from a local community singing and dancing group next to South Kilburn Studios; the studios had a scheme in which artists could use the studios for free if a trainee was taken on. Music video The music video contains a CGI snake. Band member Jack Patterson taught himself CGI animation for the video. He had the idea for a snake for a year previously, and said that \\"it was quite daunting having to make it a reality learning how to use 3D animation software on the hoof\\". The video contains two dancers, Rhys Dennis and Kandaka Moore, who - over the course of two hours - were painted gold (using stop-frame animation, the whole process takes about 25 seconds) and then went into central London. Critical reception Critical reception was mixed. MTVIggy.com said that the song was \\"a funky hodgepodge of elements from the soul-sangin‚Äô vocalists, calypso-flecked xylophone chimes and sharp snare drum beats\\".

Since the early 20th century, Haitians have made up the largest immigrant population in the Dominican Republic.  History  After the Dominican War of Independence ended, Haitian immigration to the Dominican Republic was focalized in the border area; this immigration was encouraged by the Haitian government and consisted of peasants who crossed the border to the Dominican Republic because of the land scarcity in Haiti; in 1874 the Haitian military occupied La Miel valley and Rancho Mateo. In 1899 the Haitian government claimed the center- west and the south-west of the Dominican Republic, including western Lake Enriquillo, as it estimated that Haitians had become the majority in that area. Consuelo However, the arrival of Haitians to the rest of the country began after the United States occupation of Haiti and the Dominican Republic around 1916, when US-owned sugar companies imported, annually, thousands of Haitian workers to cut costs. The 1935 census revealed that several border towns were of Haitian majority; between 1920 and 1935 the Haitian population in the Dominican Republic doubled. In 1936, Haiti received several of these villages located in La Miel valley after a revision of the borderline. Between 1935 and 1937 the dictator Rafael L. Trujillo imposed restrictions on foreign labor and ordered the deportation of Haitians in the border area, but these measures failed due to a corruption scheme involving Dominican military men, civil authorities, and US-owned sugar companies, in the trafficking of undocumented Haitian immigrants. After April 1937, Cuba began the deportation of thousands of Haitians; this led to the arrival of unemployed Haitians en masse to the Dominican Republic. In August 1937, amid a tour to border towns, Trujillo received complaints of looting, pillaging and cattle raiding, and people insinuated that he had no control over the Haitians. Drunk at a soir√©e, Trujillo decided that every Haitian should be annihilated. Lieutenant Adolf \\"Boy\\" Frappier, a German adviser to President Trujillo, advised him to use the shibboleth perejil (Spanish for \\"parsley\\") to identify Haitians by their accent, because the \\"r\\" in perejil was difficult for Haitians to pronounce properly. Thousands died along the borderland, the Northwest Line and the Cibao, and thousands more fled to Haiti. In 1975, Joaqu√≠n Balaguer, the Dominican Republic's interim Foreign Minister at the time of the massacre, put the number of dead at 17,000. Other estimates compiled by the Dominican historian Bernardo Vega went as high as 35,000. Haitians that were working for the American sugar companies, or living in the East of the country, were not harmed. As a result of the slaughter, the Dominican Republic paid to Haiti an indemnity of US$ 525,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). The genocide sought to be justified on the pretext of fearing infiltration, but was actually also a retaliation, commented on both in national currencies, as well as having been informed by the Military Intelligence Service (the dreaded SIM), that the Haitian government was cooperating with a plan that sought to overthrow Dominican exiles. After the events of 1937, Haitian migration to the Dominican Republic halted, until in 1952 Trujillo and the Haitian president Paul Eug√®ne Magloire agreed on the annual shipment of thousands of Haitian laborers to work in American-owned and Dominican-owned sugar plantations, paying the Dominican government a price per head to its Haitian counterpart. In the 1960s, after the fall of the dictatorship of Trujillo, Haitian immigration boomed: according to Joaqu√≠n Balaguer, 30,000 Haitians crossed the border between 1960 and 1965. During the administrations of Joaqu√≠n Balaguer, Antonio Guzm√°n and Salvador Jorge Blanco, in Dominican Republic, and the Duvaliers, in Haiti, the influx of Haitian labourers was continuous and was increasing. Every year contracts were signed between both countries for the importation of over ten thousand Haitians as temporary workers (although they were rarely returned to their country) in exchange for the payment of millions of dollars.  Economic and social issues  Santiago, Dominican Republic. Many Haitians migrate to the Dominican Republic primarily to escape the poverty in Haiti. In 2003, 80% of all Haitians were poor (54% in extreme poverty) and 47.1% were illiterate. The country of nine million people has a fast-growing population, but over two thirds of the jobs are not in formal work places. Haiti's GDP per capita was $1,300 in 2008, or less than one-sixth of that in the Dominican Republic. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Haitians have migrated to the Dominican Republic, with some estimates of 800,000 Haitians in the country, while others believe they are more than a million. Many Haitian migrants or their descendants work in low-paid and unskilled jobs in building construction, household cleaning, and in plantations.[\\"Migration in the Caribbean: Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Beyond\\"] In 2005 Dominican President Leonel Fern√°ndez criticized that collective expulsions of Haitians were \\"improper and inhumane\\". After a delegation from the United Nations issued a preliminary report stating that it found a profound problem of racism and discrimination against people of Haitian origin, the Chancellor Dominican Carlos Morales Troncoso gave a formal statement saying \\"Our border with Haiti has its problems, this is our reality, and this must be understood. It‚Äôs important not to confuse national sovereignty with indifference, and not to confuse security with xenophobia\\" After the earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, the number of Haitians doubled to 2 million, most of whom illegally crossed after the border opened for international aid. Human Rights Watch estimated that 70,000 documented Haitian immigrants and 1,930,000 undocumented immigrants were living in Dominican Republic. Before 2010, the Constitution of the Dominican Republic generally granted citizenship to anyone born in the country, except children of diplomats and persons \\"in transit\\". The 2010 constitution was amended to define all undocumented residents as \\"in transit\\". On September 23, 2013, the Dominican Republic Constitutional Court issued a ruling that retroactively applied this definition to 1929, the year Haiti and the Dominican Republic formalized the border. The decision stripped Dominican citizenship from about 210,000 people who were born in the Dominican Republic after 1929 but are descended from undocumented immigrants from Haiti. Many of the Dominican Republic-born do not have Haitian citizenship and have never been to Haiti; the decision rendered them at least temporarily stateless. Some Haitians began leaving voluntarily or in response to ethnic violence. The government set a deadline of June 17, 2015 for affected people to leave the Dominican Republic, as nighttime \\"bandits\\" threatened Haitians with violence and deportation; by August 2015 \\"hundreds\\" had been deported.  Demographics  province in the Dominican Republic; Pedernales has the highest proportion, 30%, and San Crist√≥bal the lowest, 2%.

People of the region dies without food and water. The novel goes on to explain the burial customs and unveils that the corpses were buried in a separate hole initially, then slowly one small hole for the family and then ended up digging a big hole for all those die on that particular day. It also painfully explains that people who helped bringing the corpses to the burial ground died right there and happened to be buried along with the corpses they carried in their shoulders. Veeramma, Sanmugam and Malayamma dies of famine. Karuppi falls ill and dies. The era set in the novel is one of the dark period when certain caste people were not allowed in temples.

Academic career As a child, Palmer lived with his parents in Kendleshire (South Gloucestershire). Palmer took his first school lessons at the Hambrook School (Hambrook), enrolling there on 30 August 1926, as recorded in the Admission Register 1922‚Äì1946. On 2 September 1932, he went to Bristol Grammar School.Hambrook School Admission Register 1922‚Äì1946: ‚Ä≥Won scholarship for Bristol Grammar School‚Ä≥. Later, Palmer was educated at New College, Oxford. In the 1940s, Palmer was a member of the British Army, where he attained the military rank of Lieutenant. After the end of World War II, Palmer became a member of the teaching staff at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, with a post of Lecturer from 1950 to 1960.Book excerptise: Grammar, Frank Robert Palmer. John Rupert Firth was the Head of Department at the time and encouraged there a number of his disciples and colleagues, many who later became well known linguists, to carry out research on a number of African and Oriental languages. Under his leadership, Palmer worked on Ethiopean languages, T.F. Mitchell on Arabic and Berber languages, Michael Halliday on Chinese, and Richard Keith Sprigg on the phonology of Asian languages. In 1952, Palmer travelled in Ethiopia for one year carrying out fieldwork in the local languages.Anastasios Tsangalidƒìs; Roberta Facchinetti; Frank Robert Palmer: Studies on English Modality: In Honour of Frank Palmer. Band 111 von Linguistic Insights. Studies in Language and Communication, Peter Lang, Oxford 2009, , p. 9. His scientific interests had been the Ethiopian languages for instance Tigre, Bilin, Amharic languages, and the language of the Agaw people from the group of the Cushitic languages. Palmer became Professor of Linguistics at University College, Bangor, in 1960. In 1965, he and a number of Bangor colleagues moved to the University of Reading to establish the Department of Linguistic Science. Palmer was appointed Professor of Linguistic Science and under his headship the department quickly developed an international reputation. In 1955, he was inducted into the Linguistic Society of America.Member list of LSA. In 1971, Palmer was appointed one of the Professorship Holders of the Linguistic Society of America.Past Linguistic Institutes: Named Professorships. He was later made a Fellow of the British Academy and of the Academia Europaea. He retired in 1987 with the title of Emeritus Professor of Linguistic Science. Palmer was the editor of the Journal of Linguistics from 1969 until 1979. He enjoyed a worldwide reputation and consequently travelled widely in North and South America, Asia, North Africa, and Europe. In 1981, he was a visiting lecturer at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. Palmer's Mood and Modality Palmer treated modality in language or languages generally.Charles W. Kreidler: Introducing English Semantics. Routledge, London / New York (1998), pp. 95 and 248, . In his book Mood and Modality, first published in 1986, Palmer developed a typological study of modality or mood. Another publication Modality and the English Modals had already appeared in 1979. Palmer pointed out the current interest in mood and modality, as well as in grammatical typology in general. =Classification of modality in modal systems= Modality can be classified as Propositional Modality and Event Modality. Propositional Modality can be further subdivided into * Epistemic ModalitySee also or compare Epistemic modal logic. and * Evidential Modality. Event Modality in turn can be of two types: * Deontic ModalitySee also or compare Deontic logic. and * Dynamic Modality. In Deontic Modality, the conditioning factors are external to the relevant individual or speaker, whereas with Dynamic Modality they are internal.Terence Langendoen: Palmer, Mood and Modality, 2nd ed.

Built in 1850 on an artificial hill, the windmill functioned as gristmill. It was built as a tower mill and its sails have a span of . The mill is a national monument (nr 32716) since 19 May 1971. The Molen van Aerden can be visited by appointment.  History  The mill was built in 1850 and was used as a gristmill. It was built by order of Johannes van de Wijgert, who sold it four years later to Johannes Aerden from Wouw. To be less dependent on the wind, a steam engine was placed in 1883 and a petroleum engine in 1903. In 1918 the mill was connected to the electric net. However the wind was still used until 1951. In 1936, miller M. van Riet installed his system that ensured that the mill automatically adjusted its direction to the wind. In 1975 the municipality of Roosendaal en Nispen bought the mill and had it restored. In 1998 the mill was once again in working order. To maintain the mill it would have to function regularly; however this was not done enough. Therefore, it had to be restored again in 2011.

She was a pioneer of Finnish historical fiction and one of the first woman journalists in Finland. In her own time, she was mainly known as the wife of her famous husband, poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg. The family lived most of their life in Porvoo, where she created most of her works, including the historical novel Fru Catharina Boije och hennes d√∂ttrar (1858). She wrote in Swedish. Life and career Born in a bourgeoise family in Jakobstad, Fredrika Tengstr√∂m lived most of her youth in Turku, the then capital of Finland. She was educated in Anna Salmberg's school for girls in 1824‚Äì25.Suomen kansallisbiografia (Finland's national biography) She met her future husband, Johan Ludvig Runeberg, her second cousin, while living with her great uncle Jakob Tengstr√∂m, Archbishop of Turku, in Pargas, having lost her home in the Great Fire of Turku in 1827. In 1828, she moved to Helsinki, the new capital, with her mother, and married Runeberg in January 1831. The family settled in Porvoo and had seven sons; the only daughter died an infant. Fredrika Runeberg was the first Finnish author to critically analyze the status of women, at home and in the society. Her oeuvre includes two historical novels: Fru Catharina Boije och hennes d√∂ttrar (1858), set in Finland during the Great Northern War, and Sigrid Liljeholm (1862), set in the Cudgel War. She also contributed to various newspapers and magazines, and translated foreign literature and articles, mostly from French, German, and English, into Swedish. Legacy =Runeberg torte= According to a legend, Fredrika Runeberg is the creator of the famous Finnish pastry, the Runeberg torte, although her recipe is also said to be based upon an earlier recipe by confectioner Lars Astenius from Porvoo. The torte is typically served on Johan Ludvig Runeberg's birthday, on 5 February, which is an established flag day in Finland. The torte tradition has spread all over Finland, commemorating the country's national poet. =Home museum= Shortly after her death, the Runeberg family home in Porvoo was made into a museum in 1882, being one of the most popular sights in town. =Fredrika Runeberg Stipendium= Since 1987, the Swedish Cultural Foundation in Finland has awarded the annual Fredrika Runeberg Stipendium in her memory to a \\"mother of community\\", i.e. women with political or societal achievements. The laureates include prominent people like Elisabeth Rehn (1996), M√§rta Tikkanen (2001), Eva Biaudet (2006), and Astrid Thors (2011). Bibliography * Fru Catharina Boije och hennes d√∂ttrar.

He wrote six novels, the first of which, El mundo de Juan Lob√≥n (1967), is his best known work. It won the Premio de la Cr√≠tica and was turned into a television series. He also won the Premio Alfaguara in 1971 for Lena Verde.Obit. Family background Luis Berenguer Moreno de Guerra was born in El Ferrol (La Coru√±a) on December 11, 1923. He did not have Galician roots. He was born there, as he himself used to say, by \\"Ministerial order\\" as his father had been posted to El Ferrol as a naval doctor. Luis was the third son of Rafael Berenguer de las Cagigas and Mar√≠a Luisa Moreno de Guerra. His Berenguer forebears came from both old Navy and landowning families. His paternal grandfather, Juan Berenguer Salazar, born in Callosa de Ensarriat (Alicante), was also a naval doctor. Specializing in tropical diseases, he spent thirteen years in the Philippines before being sent to help with a cholera epidemic in Valencia, where his son was born. Another paternal relation was General D√°maso Berenguer y Fust√© (1873-1953), Presidente del Gobierno (i.e. Prime minister) during the short period called \\"Dictablanda\\", which in 1930 followed the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. Although only second cousins, they had been very close since childhood and one of Luis's brothers, Juan, married the general's granddaughter. On Luis's mother's side his grandfather Rafael Moreno de Guerra y Croquer, a native of San Fernando (C√°diz) and another naval officer, pursued a typical colonial career: after four years in Cuba and two in Fernando Po he spent twelve years in the Philippines, where his last posting was civil- military governor in Pollok (Mindanao). Rafael's second wife, Emilia Fern√°ndez Ruiz de Morales, daughter of an Army officer from Extremadura, had lived in Manila since her childhood. Their daughter, Luis's mother, Mar√≠a Luisa Moreno de Guerra, was born aboard ship in the bay of Zamboanga at the moment that the Spanish flag was lowered in the islands: thus in the family it was always said that she was the last Spaniard of Filipinos. Many more distant ancestors on Luis Berenguer's mother's side (the Moreno de Guerra, Mac√©, Croquer y Tiscar) played distinguished roles in the history of San Fernando. His great- grandfather, Juan Nepomuceno Moreno de Guerra y Mac√©, was the Mayor of the city in 1846-1847, Member of Parliament, hereditary Knight of Ronda and rich landowner, who donated land for a public park in San Fernando (which still exists under his name) in 1853. The Croquer, another old naval family from San Fernando, came originally from Cornwall. In 1927 the Berenguer-Moreno de Guerra family moved to Madrid, taking Luis's maternal grandmother with them. Luis used to recall from his childhood that \\"Grandma told us stories of those islands that excited our imagination, using some words in Tagalo (the native language of the Philippines), stories of lizards and snakes and a wet-nurse who wanted to exchange her son for my cousin Paco, because he was more beautiful\\". His grandmother told further stories, more or less apocryphal, of how she was defending the bay when the enemies took her prisoner and burned her finger to force her to reveal where the cannons were. Such eccentricities all added to Luis Berenguer's upbringing within a conservative and religious Spanish family. Early life Part of the reason why Luis ended up in San Fernando was that his mother's family had deep roots in the South of Spain, as we have seen. At the beginning of the Civil War, however, his father Rafael Berenguer de las Cagigas was on leave in Madrid, having just disembarked from his ship Cervantes. He was taken prisoner by the Republican government, as one of the many officers suspected of cooperation with the Nationalist rebels and was taken to San Ant√≥n jail in Cartagena. His wife and his three children, plus two nephews who had just lost their parents in the bombing of Madrid, were taken in due course to La Aljorra outside Cartagena, where Rafael, her husband and still a prisoner, had been put to work as a doctor. For Luis, his brother and his cousins, all \\"children of the war\\", the civil war was a time of freedom. He loved Nature and every kind of animal. He was taken to farms. He played Tarzan and the Apes with his cousins in the countryside around Cartagena. \\"We never had a better time in our lives\\", as his brother wrote later. They rode a bicycle (only one between five children). They had a donkey which they loved so much that they brushed its teeth. They fed the horses and chickens. They milked the goats and sheep and picked everything they could find: tomatoes, wild artichokes, oranges, figs and almonds. At the end of the war Luis's father's status was extremely delicate. Like many others he might have faced death for giving help to the now defeated Republicans in spite of the fact that he only did so under duress. As it was, he was brought before a military court (Tribunal de Depuraci√≥n) and cleared, a verdict no doubt helped by family connections. In 1940 the family moved to San Fernando, where Rafael was appointed Director of San Carlos, the naval hospital. In 1944 Luis, followed by his brothers and his two cousins all joined the Navy. ‚ÄúThat was something so obvious for us that we never thought you could become anything else\\". He married Elvira Monz√≥n Ristori (b. Grazalema, 1927) in April 1954 in San Fernando and moved to Madrid, where their first two daughters were born. He found the job of a junior officer at the Admiralty (Cuerpo General) boring and decided to widen his studies in order to become an engineer. For that, he had to remain in Madrid. He frequented literary circles, above all at the Gij√≥n caf√©. His extrovert and generous personality made him particularly welcome and he made many friends. He met D√°maso Alonso, Gerardo Diego, Jos√© Garc√≠a Nieto, Ram√≥n de Garciasol, √Ångel Oliver, Jos√© Gerardo Manrique de Lara and Juan Garc√©s (writer and naval judge), among others. With Oliver he used to pay visits to P√≠o Baroja. Berenguer confessed that the first Spanish literary figures that he admired were Miguel de Unamuno and then Jos√© Ortega y Gasset. These were in turn displaced by Pio Baroja and then by his friends and contemporaries Camilo Jos√© Cela and Miguel Delibes. To conclude his studies in engineering (naval weapons), he was sent to Washington. The year in the United States (1956-1957) was very pleasant for him: the comfortable \\"American way of life\\" bore no comparison with the poor standard of living in Spain; neither did the ease of social relationships. Back from America he applied for a posting in C√°diz. Several issues combined to make him take this decision, which meant moving away from Spain's literary circles. His father had cancer and lived in San Fernando, as did his parents-in-law; it was cheaper than Madrid and they were expecting their fourth child (of eleven eventually). Luis came to say, maybe just to console himself, that, if he had remained in Madrid at the in-crowd at the Gij√≥n caf√©, he would not have written a single line. Still a naval officer, he died suddenly of a heart attack in 1979. By then he had completed six novels, through which he had ridden rapidly to the Spanish literary Olympus, thanks particularly to the first, The World of Juan Lob√≥n (El mundo de Juan Lob√≥n), which was later made into a television series. The writer In an unpublished text and in several interviews Berenguer affirmed that he did not find his own identity in his childhood and youth; rather - following, perhaps, Baroja's \\"sentimental base\\" of every writer's feelings - that \\"his vital time\\", i.e. his own world rather than his parents¬¥ world, was the decade of the 1950s: all the time before that was in a way outside him, to be recalled later through adult eyes. Since his early 20s, though, he had been conscious of his literary vocation, writing in secret in between his naval duties without publishing anything until 1967. Berenguer was fond of sport shooting. This took him deep into the Andalusian countryside and mountains, where he formed friendships with some of the peasants who eked out their solitary lives in those wild surroundings. From these encounters came the inspiration for a series of biographical sketches, of which the most important was that of Jos√© Ruiz Morales (Alcal√° de los Gazules, 1927 - Marbella, 1996), better known by everybody as ‚ÄúPerea‚Äù. This provided the initial idea for his first book, as a result of an incident that he recounted as follows: \\"The series of biographical sketches of wild Gaditanos came to me like a shot from my gun. At the start these were festive vignettes written for fun rather than from any idea of serious literature and only developed in that direction when I introduced the character who was to become Juan Lob√≥n. The note of pathos demanded by the strength and integrity of Lob√≥n's character inevitably broke the comic mood, culminating in a trivial incident which gave me the story's true theme. Three days before Christmas Juan Lob√≥n arrived at my front door to ask me to do him the favour of going with him to the Guardia Civil headquarters to get his shooting licence back. There, in reply, the Police produced a criminal record, as long as a roll of lavatory paper. In its summary it said: A dangerous person, living in sin and dwelling outside the law. The brutal shock that Juan Lob√≥n suffered on listening to such a description became the theme of my novel, i.e. that of a man who is persecuted for his virtues and for the skill with which he conducts his life; a man with a noble personality and a self-sufficient way of being at the edge of a society, from which he only calls for a doctor to help others rather himself\\". Such was the origin of The World of Juan Lob√≥n (El mundo de Juan Lob√≥n, 1967), a novel that was short-listed for the Alfaguara Prize funded by the publishing firm of the Cela brothers. But the success of the book did not end there. The Cela brothers put it forward for the Nacional de la Cr√≠tica prize, the most prestigious award in the Spanish language at that time. Luis Berenguer won, an unknown junior Naval officer, aged 43, who thus became a national figure in 1968-69. The World of Juan Lob√≥n follows the traditional picaresque path encouraged by Camilo Jos√© Cela. In the book, a peasant living in the wilds is taken to prison for an offence that he has not committed. In prison he learns that the woman he loves is going to have a baby and he cannot bear the idea that his child should grow up ashamed of his father because he had been condemned as a vago y maleante, a vagabond and evil-doer. Inspired by Lob√≥n, Berenguer was sailing close to the wind in his implied criticism of the Spain of the 1960s when the censor still ruled. Juan Lob√≥n embodied many of Berenguer's ideals: a primitive man, strong, free, honest, funny and generous; who, acting as if still in the hunter-gatherer era of human development, confronts the landowners and the civil authorities, convinced that nobody has the right to enclose the land and that wild animals and birds exist to provide food for the hunter. Lob√≥n is the incarnation of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's good savage; and, as another critic said, a border-line individual, between a gaucho and a cowboy, inside one of the great landed estates of Andalusia. Writing in the first person and with echoes of Genesis, Leviticus and also Kipling's Jungle Book, Berenguer's ideal Juan Lob√≥n opens the book with statements of his creed, explaining the conflict between the age-old unwritten law and the new law made by the rich against the poor: \\"They made the law for other people, for inadequate people, for ignorant people, who have never had to struggle for life in the wild [‚Ä¶]. I know that nobody gets off his donkey just to allow the donkey rest; he does so only because he has become tired of riding on the donkey or because he has reached his destination [‚Ä¶]\\" Berenguer reflects the rural poverty of the South which he had seen with his own eyes since the 1940s. The natural environment of Lob√≥n is that of traditional Andalusia, a countryside in deep crisis where a primitive economy still existed, based on hunting and gathering (asparagus, snails, palm hearts, mushrooms, heather roots). However, this world, romantically seen as a Garden of Eden, is changing: in a few short years it is leaving behind the feudal attitudes of the great estates and the poverty which was rife in the post-war years, to embrace the developments of the 1960s and the arrival of the Sunday hunters of the urban middle class, both of which threatened the traditional life of the wild. After the success of his first book Berenguer, with the discipline of a professional writer, published five more novels with different, though often related, themes: The hard life of the fishermen along the C√°diz coast (Marea escorada, \\"High Tide\\" 1969); the insuperable tensions between landowners and peasants in the Andalusian countryside (Lena Verde, \\"Green Firewood\\", 1972); the historic neglect leading to the eventual defeat of naval officers sent out to the colonies in the 19th century (Sotavento. Cr√≥nica de los olvidados, \\"Leeward, chronicle of the Forgotten Ones\\", 1973); the decline of the old seigneurial class and the arrival of new money in the countryside (La noche de Catalina virgen \\"The Night of Catalina the Virgin\\", 1975); and, finally, the feeling of alienation felt by those trapped by their education and their past and thus left behind by the modern world (Tamatea, novia del oto√±o, \\"Tamatea, Autumn's Girlfriend\\", published posthumously in 1980). All Berenguer's books are still in print, the last complete edition being in 2009. As we have seen, one of them was adapted for a television series (El mundo de Juan Lob√≥n). The author would also have been very pleased to see just how many words, previously only current in Andalusia, have now been incorporated into the Diccionario del Espa√±ol Actual (1999, 2011), thanks to him and to the power of the characters that he created.

It held that an Internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal information which appears on web pages published by third parties. The outcome of the ruling is that an Internet search engine must consider requests from individuals to remove links to freely accessible web pages resulting from a search on their name. Grounds for removal include cases where the search result(s) \\"appear to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive in the light of the time that had elapsed.\\" If the search engine rejects the request, the individual may ask relevant authorities to consider the case. Under certain conditions, the search engine may be ordered to remove the links from search results. The decision was claimed as a so-called right to be forgotten, although the Court did not explicitly grant such a right, depending instead on the data subject's rights deriving from Article 7 (respect for private and family life) and Article 8 (protection of personal data) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The General Data Protection Regulation was mooted to include a right to be forgotten, but between the draft and the final version this was changed to a right to request erasure for a set of specific reasons. Facts In 1998 the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia published two announcements in its printed edition regarding the forced sale of properties arising from social security debts. The announcements were published on the order of the Spanish Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and their purpose was to attract as many bidders as possible. A version of the edition was later made available on the web.The announcements in question: (in Catalan), accessed 16 May 2014. Translation: \\"Property auctions....the two undivided halves of a house at 8 Montseny St., owned by Mario Costeja Gonz√°lez and Alicia Vargas Cots.....\\" One of the properties described in the newspaper announcements belonged to Mario Costeja Gonz√°lez, who was named in the announcements. In November 2009, Costeja contacted the newspaper to complain that when his name was entered in the Google search engine it led to the announcements. He asked that the data relating to him be removed, arguing that the forced sale had been concluded years before and was no longer relevant. The newspaper replied that erasing his data was not appropriate since the publication had been on the order of the Spanish Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Costeja then contacted Google Spain in February 2010, asking that the links to the announcements be removed. Google Spain forwarded the request to Google Inc., whose registered office is in California, United States, taking the view that this was the responsible body. Costeja subsequently lodged a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (Agencia Espa√±ola de Protecci√≥n de Datos, AEPD) asking both that the newspaper be required to remove the data, and that Google Spain or Google Inc. be required to remove the links to the data. On 30 July 2010, the Director of AEPD rejected the complaint against the newspaper but upheld the complaint against Google Spain and Google Inc., calling on them to remove the links complained of and make access to the data impossible. Google Spain and Google Inc. subsequently brought separate actions against the decision before the Audiencia Nacional (National High Court of Spain). Their appeal was based on: # Google Inc. was not within the scope of the EU Directive 95/46/EC (Data Protection Directive) and its subsidiary Google Spain was not responsible for the search engine # there was no processing of personal data within the search function # even were there processing, neither Google Inc. nor Google Spain could be regarded as a data controller # in any event, the data subject (Costeja) did not have the right to erasure of lawfully published material The Audiencia Nacional joined the actions and stayed the proceedings pending a preliminary ruling from the CJEU on a number of questions regarding the interpretation of the Data Protection Directive. These questions fell into three groups. In essence they concerned: # the territorial scope of the Directive # the legal position of an Internet search engine service provider under the Directive, especially in terms of the Directive's material scope and as to whether the search engine could be regarded as a data controller # whether the Directive establishes a so-called right to be forgotten All of these questions, also raising important points of fundamental rights protection, were new to the court. Because new points of law were involved, the opinion of an advocate general was sought by the court. =Procedure= Written proceedings followed by an oral hearing were held on 26 February 2013, at which, besides the parties, the governments of Austria, Greece, Italy, Spain and Poland and the European Commission gave their opinion. Advocate General Niilo J√§√§skinen gave his opinion on 25 June 2013, after which judgment was given on 13 May 2014. =Advocate general's opinion= The purpose of an advocate general's opinion is to advise the court on new points of law. It is not binding on the court. In this case the advocate general was Niilo J√§√§skinen from Finland. Advocate General J√§√§skinen made frequent reference in his opinion to the fact that the Data Protection Directive predates the Google era (it dates from 1995 and, as of May 2018, has been replaced by the General Data Protection Regulation). On the first set of questions, the advocate general found that Google's business model brought Google Inc. and Google Spain within the scope of the Directive. On the second set of questions concerning the material scope of the Directive, the advocate general held that Google could not be regarded as a data controller: Google's search activities involve the processing of personal data, but Google does not thereby become a data controller for the content of the material when the processing is carried out in a haphazard, indiscriminate and random manner. In the advocate general's view the sense of the Directive was that \\"the controller is aware of the existence of a certain defined category of information amounting to personal data and the controller processes this data with some intention which relates to their processing as personal data\\". In the event that the court did not agree with his finding that Google was not a data controller, the advocate general considered the third set of questions relating to a right to be forgotten. He held that the rights of freedom of information and expression took precedence over any such right to erasure, and urged the court not to allow case-by-case resolution of such conflicts as that would likely lead to the \\"automatic withdrawal of links to any objected contents or to an unmanageable number of requests handled by the most popular and important Internet search engine service providers.\\" Judgment The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that an Internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties, upholding a right of erasure. The court considered the material scope of the Directive first. The court rejected Google's submission, supported by the Advocate General, that it could not be regarded as a data controller within the scope of the Data Protection Directive, adopting a literal interpretation of article 2(b), giving definitions and relying on Lindqvist. Regarding the territorial scope of the Directive, the court observed that Google Spain is a subsidiary of Google Inc. on Spanish territory and, therefore, an 'establishment' within the meaning of the directive. The court rejected Google Inc.'s argument that it was not carrying out its data processing in Spain, holding that the promotion and selling of advertising space by its subsidiary Google Spain was sufficient to constitute processing within the meaning of the directive. To have ruled otherwise would have been to undermine the effectiveness of the directive and the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals that the directive seeks to ensure. The court thus endorsed the Advocate General's view that Google Inc. and Google Spain should be treated as a single economic unit. Concerning the obligations and duties of the operator of a search engine, the court held that in the present case Article 7(f) of the directive, relating to legitimacy of processing, requires a balancing of the opposing rights and interests of the data subject (Gonz√°lez) and the data controller (Google), taking into account the data subject's rights deriving from articles 7 (respect for private and family life) and 8 (protection of personal data) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Article 14(a) of the Directive, relating to the data subject's rights, allows the data subject, at least in the cases covered by articles 7(e) and 7(f), to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation to the processing of data relating to him, save where otherwise provided by national legislation. Article 12(b) of the directive, relating to the data subject's right of access to the data, allows the data subject to request erasure of the data. Such request may be made directly of the controller, who must then duly examine the merits of the request. If the request is not granted, the data subject may then direct the request to a supervisory authority or the judicial authority so that it carries out the necessary checks and orders the controller to take specific measures accordingly. Regarding the question relating to the so- called right to be forgotten, the court noted that Google Spain, Google Inc., the Greek, Austrian and Polish governments and the European Commission considered that this question should be answered in the negative. The court held, however, that the processing of data which is \\"inadequate, irrelevant or excessive\\" (i.e. not merely inaccurate) might also be incompatible with the directive. In such cases, where the data is incompatible with the provisions of article 6(1)(e) to (f) of the directive, relating to data quality, the information and links in the list of the results must be erased. It is not necessary that the information is prejudicial to the data subject. Significance The ruling balances the right to privacy and data protection in European law with the legitimate interest of the public to access such information, and it does not mandate that information is instantly removed upon request. It distinguishes between public figures and private persons. The Court stressed that Internet search engines profile individuals in modern society in an ubiquitous manner, in a way that could not otherwise have been obtained formerly save only with the greatest difficulty. The data subject's rights must therefore in general override \\"as a rule, not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in finding that information upon a search relating to the data subject's name\\", but that would not be the case if the role played by the data subject in public life is such \\"that the interference with his fundamental rights is justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having, on account of inclusion in the list of results, access to the information in question\\". Google subsequently published an online form which can be used by EU citizens or EFTA nationals to request the removal of links from its search results if the data linked is \\"inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed\\".Google sets up 'right to be forgotten' form after EU ruling BBC News, 30 May 2014. Retrieved 30 May 2014. On 31 May 2014, the first day of the service, Google received over 12,000 requests from people asking the company to remove certain links about them from its search results. On 19 June 2015, Google announced it would remove links to nonconsensual pornography (\\"revenge porn\\") on request. Commentators noted that this was not the same thing as implementing a \\"right to be forgotten\\" as the company already has policies in place dealing with sensitive personal data such as social security numbers and credit card numbers. However, the consumer advocacy group Consumer Watchdog subsequently called on Google to extend the right to be forgotten to US users, filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. Commentary  Implementation  The EU's Article 29 Data Protection Working Party issued its guidelines on how the ruling should be implemented on 26 November 2014. Google published its advisory committee's report on how the ruling should be implemented on 5 February 2015.

The committee recommended that only national links, not global links, should be removed, and that publishers should be notified of the removals and have the right to challenge them. On 7 February 2015, The Times reported that the chairwoman of the Article 29 Working Party, , has warned Google that it faces legal action if it fails to heed its warnings over the way Google is policing the ruling. The working party wants Google to stop notifying publishers and to remove its links globally. See also * Bodil Lindqvist v √Öklagarkammaren i J√∂nk√∂ping (Lindqvist) * Melvin v.

Mosse gained significant attention for his photographs of the war in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo using colour infrared film intended to create a new perspective on conflict. It was also made into a film with cinematographer Trevor Tweeten and composer Ben Frost. This work was published in three publications, exhibited in solo exhibitions, and won the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Prize in 2014. In 2017 his video installation Incoming, commissioned by the National Gallery of Victoria and the Barbican Art Gallery, made in collaboration with musician Ben Frost and Trevor Tweeten, won the Prix Pictet. Life and work Mosse was born in Kilkenny, Ireland. He lives and works in New York and Berlin.http://www.carliergebauer.com/artists/richard_mosse/cv He received a first class BA in English literature from King's College London in 2001, an MRes in cultural studies from the London Consortium in 2003, a postgraduate diploma in fine art from Goldsmiths, University of London in 2005 and a photography MFA from Yale School of Art in 2008. He has worked in Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Palestine, Haiti and the former Yugoslavia. He is best known for his infrared images from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). For his infrared photographs he used a large format camera and the now-discontinued Kodak Aerochrome film. Aerochrome is a false-color infrared film originally intended for aerial vegetation surveys and for military reconnaissance, such as to identify camouflaged targets. It registers light that can't be seen by humans rendering the grass and trees and soldiers' uniforms in vivid hues of lavender, crimson and hot pink. Critic Sean O'Hagan, writing in The Guardian, said \\"His images from there often seem to skirt the real and the fictional, simply though [sic] their heightened and unreal colours. He has made the familiar seem strange and the real seem heightened to the point of absurdity. This is war reportage ‚Äì but not as we know it.\\" Willy Staley, writing in the New York Times Magazine, said \\"Mosse highlights the eastern Congo's natural bounty while acknowledging both the medium's origins and, he points out, the West's tendency to see in the Congo only darkness and insanity.\\" Publications * Infra.

He graduated from the Duperr√© School of Decorative Arts in Paris in 2002, and the following year he went to work for firms like Christian Dior Monsieur.  Awards and distinctions  In 2005 he won the Special Award for Creativity at the 20th Hy√®res International Fashion & Photography Festival.  Career  = Multidisciplinary projects =  Fondation Cartier  In 2005 he choreographed and directed an installation- performance for the Fondation Cartier's Nomadic Nights.  en:trance  In 2006, Romain Kremer took on a collaboration project with the choreographer Christian Rizzo. The project, dubbed en:trance, presented variations of workshops, conferences and exhibits and was a cooperation with the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, the Ecole nationale sup√©rieure de cr√©ation industrielle, the National Center for Visual Arts (Centre national des arts plastiques: CNAP) and the Centre National de la Danse.  Studio Harcourt  In 2010, the Parisian photo studio, Studio Harcourt, photographed Romain Kremer‚Äôs collection archives. Followed by an expo \\"Retrospectrum\\" which opened in Paris on June 27, 2010, then continued on a tour of Europe's principal fashion capitals. The pictures were subsequently featured in \\"L'Art du portrait selon Studio Harcourt : Secrets et techniques\\", a book published by the Studio Harcourt in December 2010. = Fashion designer =  Romain Kremer  In the wake of his Special Award for Creativity at Hy√®res, he launched, in 2005, his homonymous menswear brand. Notably presenting boys in sheer pink floor-length dresses for spring / summer 2009, it kept in with their masculinity. Often presenting futuristic and post- apocalyptic narratives to hard techno soundtracks, the New York Times stated that Romain Kremer knows how to create a fashion moment. The designer has been compared to Pierre Cardin on GQ magazine, undeniably due to his Space Age approach to contemporary menswear. Romain Kremer stopped his brand as he was called to join Thierry Mugler in 2010.  Mugler  Rosemary Rodriguez's departure as artistic director of the house of Thierry Mugler lands a triumvirate to the head of the Parisian house of couture's fashion departments: Romain Kremer as head menswear designer, S√©bastien Peign√© for womenswear and Nicola Formichetti as creative director. From 2011 to 2013 Romain Kremer was the man responsible for men's ready-to-wear, in collaboration with Nicola Formichetti, and in January 2011 presented their first collection \\"Anatomy of change\\" for the house of Mugler. Fall / winter 2013-2014 marked another success for Mugler menswear as Romain Kremer designed the collection from a sharp linear style into a bold, rounded contemporary silhouette. Mission accomplished, according to the New York Times. A few months later, in April 2013, the collaboration ended. = Designer =  Camper  The Spanish shoe brand, Camper is renowned for collaborating with a number of leading designers both for their collection lines and their stores, known as the Together project. In 2009, Camper called on Romain Kremer and the first Camper together with Romain Kremer shoes were shown in Paris for fall / winter 2010-2011. In 2014, the collaboration between Camper and Romain Kremer spans its 8th season. In June 2014 Camper appoints Kremer as the first ever creative director in the history of the company.  Mykita  2009-2011: Romain Kremer collaborated with German eyewear specialist, Mykita. Their first model, ROMAIN, based on ancient Inuit ocular protection and evoking vibes of war paint, with its metal shutters, was shown for spring / summer 2010. Their second season together gained international notoriety when Lady Gaga was spotted wearing the YURI, named after Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. The Los Angeles Times subsequently asked \\"who would wear this helmet?\\", while others labeled the limited-edition piece as eyewear couture For their last season together, Mykita and Romain Kremer presented the GORDON for spring / summer 2011. The lightweight model, inspired by goggles for soldering, was later worn by The Black Eyed Peas' Apl.de.ap during the Super Bowl XLV.

Life Hunt was born in Buckinghamshire, to a humble family background. At the time of his father's death, around 1830, Hunt was a night-boy in a printer's office; to support his family, he took on a day job as clerk to a barrister, who gave him an introduction to a morning newspaper. He also studied medicine, at the North London School of Medicine, and qualified as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, in 1840. In 1839 Hunt founded the Medical Times, initially edited by Robert Knox. Hunt, however, made little from it, and had to sell, to T. P. Healey, in 1841. There were reasons concerning family and money troubles. Another motivation, however, for his exit was an embroilment in libel matters, after he defended John Elliotson in his paper. He then took a post as surgeon to a poor law union in Norfolk. The Medical Times was incorporated in January 1852 with the Medical Gazette, and continued as the Medical Times and Gazette until 1885. After a year Hunt returned to London, continuing to practise medicine, and working briefly for the Anti-Corn Law League. He also resumed his connection with the press. He was successively sub-editor of the Illustrated London News, and editor of the Pictorial Times. Hunt wrote for Household Words, edited by Charles Dickens, contributing in particular on anatomical exhibitions. On the establishment of the Daily News in 1846, he was selected by Dickens as one of the assistant editors. In 1851 he was made chief editor, and under him the paper first became prosperous. He took on there as assistant editor Thomas Walker, a walk-in acquaintance from 1846, at one of his surgeries. Other recruits were Edwin Lawrence Godkin, sent to the Ottoman Empire, and Harriet Martineau as a leader writer, who became a prolific contributor. Hunt died of typhus fever, 18 November 1854. Works Hunt's major work was The Fourth Estate: Contributions towards a History of Newspapers and of the Liberty of the Press, 1850, a history of the English press. It gives details on legislative impediments to journalism; and chapters on the economy of newspaper offices in the writer's own day. He also wrote: * The Rhine: its scenery & historical & legendary associations (1845) * The Book of Art, Cartoons, Frescoes, Sculpture and Decorative Art, as Applied to the New Houses of Parliament and to Buildings in General, with an Historical Notice of the Exhibitions in Westminster Hall and Directions for Painting in Fresco (1846), editor.

Her collections are influenced by a range of sources, from eighteenth century chinoiserie to fairy tales, using specialist clays and glazes to create different textures and finishes. She works from her design studio in the Baltic Triangle, Liverpool.  Background  Appleton has a degree in printed textile design from Liverpool College of Art and established her studio in 1998. In 2001, when approached to design plates for a factory in Portugal, she spent time with the mould makers there and found her real design passion was in creating form, rather than pattern. Her work went on to retail in Marks & Spencer, John Lewis, Debenhams, Zara Home, Crate & Barrel, Anthropologie and others. She then worked with La Cafetiere, a British tea and coffee ware company, based in North Wales, where she designed a range of products, including the Lexi cafetiere and California teapot. In 2014, Appleton is still one of two designer brands (along with Nick Munro) for the company. She met ceramics agent Sidney Huang at a trade fair in China and after that meeting, began to work almost exclusively on tea ware. Appleton has been retailing her collection of tea pots, tea cups, tea towels and speciality teas under her own brand since 2012. She works closely with partners in Dehua in China, the home of Blanc de Chine porcelain. Mr Liu, an expert ceramicist, creates glazes and experiments with different types of clay in line with her requirements and designs are translated into three dimensions by master mould maker Su Kun Shui. In 2013 she picked up the Innovation award at Merseyside Woman of the Year for her work in establishing international trade. She gave tea making demonstrations at the Cake and Bake Show in Manchester in 2014 and visits trade and exhibitor fairs all over the world, including Maison et Objet in Paris, the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York and Ambiente in Frankfurt. The blenders at English tea importer and retailer Twinings recently invited her to help them create an Alison Appleton Single Origin tea blend. In November 2014, Appleton was appointed an Export Champion by UK Trade and Investment, and will work with the Government trade body to help more British companies up onto the export ladder.  Products  Appleton says that the practicalities of making a really good cup of tea are the key to her design philosophy. Her stated view is: \\"A good cup of tea should be something to take time over and savour. Good tea and tea ware should be a gift, either to oneself or to others.\\" She once told an audience at the Women in Business awards that a lady's teapot should always match her dress. Appleton says that her fascination with oriental design and culture of tea is reflected in her collections. The Darcy teaset is inspired by the Regency fashion for chinoiserie and a time when drinking afternoon tea was an important social occasion. Its teapot was featured in the Independent's Ten Best Teapots in July 2013. The Golden Carp set takes its inspiration from the carp and lotus flower, Chinese symbols of good fortune and purity. The two are featured as a relief design under a celadon glaze. The Camellia teapot is inspired by the flowers of Camellia Sinensis, the plant from China which gives us tea, and the Woodland collection is evocative of fairy-tale forests. Her view is that: \\"Every day should include a tea ceremony. Life's too short for ugly mugs and dusty teabags,\\" has resulted in all her teapots including stainless steel fine-mesh filters, so they can be used with fine and long leafed teas. Her products can be seen in shops and online retailers including Harrods, Whittards, Twinings, the British Museum and Not on the High Street. They have also been featured in British newspapers such as the Daily Mail, Sunday Express, Sunday Times and Yorkshire Post; and in magazines including Ideal Home, Good Homes, Bella, Shortlist, The English Home, House Beautiful, Beautiful Kitchens and Period Ideas.

The Infrarealists, also known as ‚Äúinfras‚Äù, took for their motto a phrase from the Chilean painter Roberto Matta: ‚ÄúBlow the brains out of the cultural establishment‚Äù. Rather than a defined style, the movement was characterised by the pursuit of a free and personal poetry, representative of its members‚Äô attitude towards life on the fringes of conventional society, in a similar manner to the Beat Generation of the 1950s.> The origin of the phrase is French. The intellectual Emmanuel Berl attributes it to one of the founders of Surrealism, the writer and political activist Philippe Soupault (1897-1990), who was also one of the driving forces behind Dadaism. According to Bola√±o, however, the name was originally coined in the 1940s by Roberto Matta, after Andr√© Breton expelled him from the Surrealists. Cast out, Matta became an ‚ÄúInfrarealist‚Äù, and the only one up until the term's rebirth as a literary movement. A third account for the name‚Äôs origin can be traced back to Russian writer Georgy Gurevich's sci-fi novella Infra Dragonis, originally published in 1959, and mentioned by Bola√±o in the first Infrarealist manifesto. The initial phase of Infrarealism, its most important, lasted until the departure of Papasquiaro and Bola√±o to Europe in 1977, who were the initiators and primary leaders of the movement. However, on Papasquiario's return to Mexico City in 1979, the movement continued once more under his leadership until his death in 1998. At present, the movement is maintained by a mix of new and original members.  History of the movement  In 1968, at a time when the future Infrarealist poets were still children and adolescents, the so-called Dirty War began to take shape in Mexico during the presidency of Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz (Institutional Revolutionary Party, 1964-1970). Amongst its principal consequences was the Tlatelolco Massacre in the Ciudad Universitaria of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where an estimated 300 to 400 students and civilians were murdered by military and police. Roberto Bola√±o, 15-years-old, arrived in Mexico City from Chile with his family this same year. In 1970, Luis Echeverr√≠a √Ålvarez (Institutional Revolutionary Party, 1970-1976) took up presidency in Mexico. He was the ex-Secretariat of the Interior in the government of D√≠az Ordaz, who was considered by the majority of the Mexican population as one of the principal culprits of the Dirty War. To recapture Mexico‚Äôs youth, the new government set up a series of cultural scholarships, in addition to the creation of artistic and cultural workshops in universities and public institutions. Some of these were run by renowned writers such as Augusto Monterroso and Alejandro Aura. The Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the UNAM organised prose and poetry workshops and published the Punto de Partida magazine through the Department of Cultural Diffusion, which also ran prose, poetry, drama and essay workshops. Further workshops were held at the Metropolitan Autonomous University (UAM), courses run at the Casa del Lago cultural centre, and scholarships granted to study literature at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Institute of Fine Arts). Infrarealism emerged at the end of Luis Echeverr√≠a‚Äôs government in the midst of this effervescence of literary workshops in Mexico City, which were allowing many young people to begin to develop as poets and novelists. Determined to create a new literary movement based on expressive freedom, the liveliness of language and the breaking of conventions. After fleeing from the 1973 events in Chile which saw Augusto Pinochet take power from Salvador Allende in a coup, Bola√±o (a Chilean who had previously spent 5 years living in Mexico) met Santiago Papasquiaro in the Caf√© La Habana in Mexico City, beginning a long friendship between the two which marked the beginning of infrarrealismo.Madariaga, 2011, op. cit. pp. 125-134; chap. 8: ¬´Despu√©s de la aventura¬ª. The movement was formally founded in Bruno Montan√© Krebs's house. There were forty people at the meeting, which was led by Bola√±o. Roberto Bola√±o and Mario Santiago Papasquiaro began to meet with other friends and poets they considered fit for the project.  Sabotages  Octavio Paz, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990, was considered by Bola√±o and the other ‚Äúinfras‚Äù as leader of the Mexican cultural establishment, and condemned because of it. According to the Chilean writer Carlos Chimal, president Luis Echeverr√≠a‚Äôs measures to promote cultural activity in the country polarised Mexico‚Äôs artistic society into ‚Äútwo worlds: high culture and popular culture, and there was no way that the two would touch‚Äù. The first of these worlds referred to artists who were granted scholarships or received benefits in some way from the Institutional Revolutionary Party's government ‚Äì among them, for example, Jos√© Luis Cuevas and Fernando Ben√≠tz. For the Infrarealists, this group also included writers and intellectuals of world renown, such as Octavio Paz or Carlos Monsiv√°is, who, despite not needing Echeverr√≠a's direct support, cultivated a dedicated readership, ran important literary magazines, and also benefited from tax revenues. At the other extreme was the world of popular culture, which the Infrarealists associated with the left-wing revolution and was made up of artists that opposed the buying and selling of talent. While members of the first group sought to identify themselves with Octavio Paz, members of the second were closer to the poet Efra√≠n Huerta. The Mexican writer Carmen Boullosa, a contemporary of the Infrarealists, agrees that both groups were exclusive, and recalls that the only poets who traversed between the two groups were Juan Pascoe and Ver√≥nica Volkow, a friend of Bola√±o and granddaughter of Trotsky. Despite this, Boullosa maintains that the two groups were not entirely dissimilar. Rather than for their own readings, the Infrarealists were known for their sabotaging of the readings, book launches, awards ceremonies and general literary activities of poets belonging to this world of ‚Äúhigh culture‚Äù. The first of these sabotages took place prior to the movement‚Äôs foundation. Towards the end of 1973, Mario Santiago Papasquiaro and his friend Ram√≥n M√©ndez attempted to throw Juan Ba√±uelos out of his own poetry workshop in the Department of Cultural Diffusion at UNAM by acquiring the signatures of participants; though in the end it was them who were thrown out. David Huerta, son of Efra√≠n Huerta, in 2009. The Infrarealists sabotaged a reading of his in 1976. The Infrarealists planned these acts in meetings. They sabotaged the events of different writers, including Octavio Paz himself. At the beginning of 1976, they sabotaged a reading by David Huerta, son of Efra√≠n Huerta. While they got along well with his father, they considered David a privileged author who was destined to succeed under the sheltered protection of his surname. Only Bola√±o participated in Huerta‚Äôs sabotaging. He later distanced himself from these acts, though still asked friends for details after the acts were carried out. Years later, Carmen Boullosa confessed to having been afraid the Infrarealists would sabotage the prize ceremony where she was to receive the Salvador Novo scholarship, awarded to those under 21, which Dar√≠o Galicia had also obtained the year before. Other poets began to both fear and hate them for these attitudes. They treated them as arrogant and disrespectful, and managed to isolate them from the established publications of the time. In 1975, in the La cultura en M√©xico supplement of Siempre! magazine, edited by Carlos Monsiv√°is, a number of columns appeared in which a young H√©ctor Aguilar Cam√≠n, Jos√© Joaquin Blanco and Enrique Krauze spoke of a drop in standard in contemporary Mexican literature, which they viewed as resulting from socialist fashion, excessive sexuality and the appearance of so many new, novice writers. Blanco began to explicitly criticise the Infrarealists in these columns, and they confronted him directly, though this time with Bola√±o in tow.  Publications and separation  In mid-1976, after Octavio Paz left Plural magazine due to political problems in what became known as the \\"Exc√©lsior coup‚Äù, Robert Rodr√≠guez Ba√±os was named as the magazine‚Äôs director and the Infrarealists once again had the opportunity to publish in established magazines. In October of the same year, in Plural number 61, Mario Santiago Papasquiaro published a review and translation of poems by the beat poet and novelist Richard Brautigan. Then, in December, in number 63, the magazine published Seis j√≥venes infrarrealistas mexicanos (Six Young Mexican Infrarealists), with editing and introduction from Papasquairo and featuring Dar√≠o Galicia, Mara Larrosa, Rub√©n Medina, Cuauth√©moc M√©ndez, Jos√© Peguero and Papasquairo himself. In January 1977, Roberto Bola√±o was published in number 64. The Infrarealists also published their own anthology in 1976, P√°jaro de calor, ocho poetas infrarrealistas (Bird of Heat, Eight Infrarealist Poets), which contained a prologue by the Spanish poet and journalist Juan Cervera Sanch√≠s. Based in Mexico, he was a regular of Caf√© La Habana, where Bola√±o and Papasquiaro held their Infrarealist meetings, and sympathised with the youthful energy of the infras. Shortly before the publication of P√°jaro de calor, and made clear in a poem of said publication, Bola√±o‚Äôs girlfriend Lisa Johnson broke up with him. This was one of the main reasons for Bola√±o‚Äôs departure to Barcelona, where his mother had been living since leaving Mexico in the mid-1970s. Before leaving, however, he reached an agreement with Editorial Extempor√°neos to publish Muchachos desnudos bajo el arcoiris de fuego. Once j√≥venes poetas latinoamericanos (Naked Boys Under the Rainbow of Fire. Eleven Young Latin American Poets), an anthology of poems featuring Luis Suard√≠az, Hern√°n Lav√≠n Cerda, Jorge Pimentel, Orlando Guill√©n, Beltr√°n Morales, Fernando Nieto Cadena, Juli√°n G√≥mez, Enrique Ver√°stegui, Mario Santiago Papasquairo, Bruno Montan√© and Bola√±o himself. Published in July 1979, the book is prefaced by Miguel Donoso Pareja, contains a piece by Efra√≠n Huerta, and was the first from that era of Infrarealists to be paid for entirely by the publisher, rather than themselves. Cover of the Infrarealist magazine, Correspondencia Infra. Mexico City, 1977. Roberto Bola√±o left Mexico in 1977, shortly followed by Bruno Montan√©, whom he would meet up with again in Barcelona. Mario Santiago Papasquiaro, on the other hand, went to Paris and Israel for a while. Rub√©n Medina and Jos√© Peguero, trying to regroup the infras who had remained in Mexico City and at the same time as a symbolic act of farewell, managed the publication of a single issue of the magazine Correspondencia Infra in October/November of that year. The magazine had a circulation of five thousand copies, of which very few original copies remain, and includes the Manifiesto Infrarrealista (Infrarealist Manifesto), written by Bola√±o, and a poem by Papasquiaro titled Consejos de un disc√≠pulo de Marx a un fan√°tico de Heidegger (Advice from a disciple of Marx to a Heidegger fanatic). Written in the days when Papasquiaro frequented the Alejandro Aura‚Äôs workshop in Casa del Lago, the poem served as inspiration for the title of the first novel by his friend Bola√±o, now living in Spain: Consejos de un disc√≠pulo de Morrison a un fan√°tico de Joyce (Advice from a disciple of Morrison to a Joyce fanatic), written in collaboration with A. G. Porta. The magazine‚Äôs poems were characterised by their stylistic variety.  The following years  Graffiti stencil of Roberto Bola√±o in Barcelona, 2012. Various other Infrarealists decided to leave Mexico City in the years following the departure of Bola√±o, Papasquiaro and Montan√©. Only some continued with literary careers, although the majority dedicated themselves to artistic activities. Rub√©n Medina went to study literature in the United States; Harrington returned to Chile to study film; Gelles Lebrija went to live in Tijuana; Piel Divina to Paris; the M√©ndez brothers returned to their hometown Morelia, where they worked in journalism, and for a time as bakers; Jos√© Vicente Anaya dedicated himself to travelling around Mexico for four years; Lorena de la Rocha chose classical music composition and theatre; and the Larrosa sisters stayed in Mexico City, with Vera devoting herself to dance and theatre, and Mara to painting. Though the first phase of the movement ended with Bola√±o and Papasquario‚Äôs departure to Europe in 1977, when Papasquario returned to Mexico City in 1979 he began to meet up with both old friends and new Infrarealists. Between April 1980 and February 1981, poems from this new group of Infraealists appeared in three issues of Le Prosa magazine, edited by Orlando Guill√©n. The sabotages also continued through the 80s, with Octavio Paz the victim of one in January 1980 at an event called the ‚ÄúMeeting of Generations‚Äù in the UNAM bookshop. Between November 1984 and July 1990, the Infrarealists published a poetry pamphlet titled Calandria de tolvaneras, which also included poems from older members like Roberto Bola√±o and Bruno Montan√©. Between March 1992 and January 1993, various Infrarealists were published in several issues of Zonaeropuerto magazine, which was also edited by Orlando Guill√©n. In March 1992 they published the magazine La zorra vuelve al gallinero, with two further issues in 2000 and 2002. The later issues, however, were without Papasquairo, who died in 1998. A decade after his death, Mario Ra√∫l Guzman and Rebeca L√≥pez, Papasquario‚Äôs widow, published Jeta de santo. Antolog√≠a po√©tica 1974-1977, which compiled 161 of Papasquario‚Äôs poems. Bola√±o undoubtedly achieved the greatest international prestige out of the older Infrarealists, establishing himself as a novelist in Barcelona and publishing numerous works for Editorial Anagrama. The standout successes of these publications were The Savage Detectives, a novel which won Spain‚Äôs Premio Herralde and was directly inspired by his life with the Infrarealists in Mexico City; and 2666, which won awards in Spain, Chile and the United States and was also set in Mexico.

Along with the ThinkPad 8, the first- generation ThinkPad 10, announced in May 2014, is part of the third-generation of ThinkPad branded tablet PCs, succeeding the ThinkPad Tablet 2. It uses Windows 8.1 as its operating system and supports a free upgrade to Windows 10. A second generation of the ThinkPad 10 was announced in May 2015. It will come with Windows 10 out of the box. Design and performance Both generations of the Lenovo ThinkPad 10 have the same design and largely identical specifications - a 10.1-inch screen size with a resolution of 1920 √ó 1200 (for a 16:10 aspect ratio). They both use low-energy Intel Atom quad-core processors, which differ between generations: the first generation employs a 1.6GHz Bay Trail (Z3795) processor with 7th Gen Intel HD Graphics, while the second generation uses a newer, faster 2.2 GHz or 2.4 GHz Cherry Trail (Z8500 or Z8700) processor with 8th Gen Intel HD Graphics. The ThinkPad 10 comes in various configurations, such as 64 and 128 GB variants with 2 or 4 gigabytes of RAM, and 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows. An 8 megapixel back camera and a 2 megapixel front camera for making video calls are included. Stylus support (with a full-sized pen with eraser tip, the first device since the ThinkPad X Series tablets with such) and cellular data are also options. The battery is rated at 33 watt hours, while Lenovo claims a battery life of ten hours. Tests conducted by Australia's PC World showed a battery life of just under seven hours while playing a 1080p video at full brightness with Wi-Fi on. A micro-HDMI port and a USB 2.0 port (USB 3.0 on second generation) are located on the edge of the device. Accessories Lenovo put a large emphasis on the wide range of accessories available for the device. They released a keyboard case (Ultrabook Keyboard) for the ThinkPad 10 with chiclet-style keys. Another keyboard case (Touch Case) is folio-style and has a flat keyboard similar to the Microsoft Surface. Both keyboard cases have a multitouch-enabled trackpad and a slot for the stylus. A third case is ruggedized, has an adjustable hand strap on the back, gaskets to cover ports, and a stylus holder; designed to dock and charge the tablet without being removed. A larger version of the QuickShot case for the ThinkPad 8 tablet is available; It automatically opens the camera app when opened. A ThinkPad Tablet Dock is available that adds three USB 3.0 ports, a full-sized HDMI output, and an ethernet jack. Styli are also sold separately. Reviews In a review for CNET, Dan Ackerman said, \\"The key selling point of the new ThinkPad 10, a 10-inch Windows 8 tablet, is not the tablet hardware itself, but the large ecosystem of optional accessories, designed to turn the slate into a laptop, desktop, or even a display kiosk. Lenovo's plan suggests the key to successful Windows tablet is the ability to also use it as an everyday PC, and that's especially true for the business users who stick to the venerable ThinkPad brand.\\" In a review for SlashGear, Brittany Hillen wrote, \\"Lenovo's Thinkpad 10 is a wonderful little Windows tablet, and the keyboard and dock accessories expand its usefulness ten-fold, allowing it to double as a workstation of sorts when needed. The display is exceptionally crisp and bright, and the keyboard dock is very functional -- you can adjust to using it immediately, rather than training your fingers to the often spongy feel of many tablet keyboards. There are no complaints about the Thinkpad 10; if you need a tablet for business or for tasks Android isn't quite up for, Lenovo's newest offering is an excellent choice.\\" In a review for Australia's PC World, Elias Plastiras wrote, \\"If processing your work at Intel Core speeds is not a necessity for your business needs, then this Intel Atom-based tablet is well worth your consideration. We like the overall combination of the light weight, built-in ports, the supplied digitiser pen, and the Full HD screen. It's a highly usable product for basic tasks, and the accessories on offer can turn it into something more than just a typical slate. We just wish more storage space was standard, and that the screen wasn't so reflective.\\" References Category:Lenovo Category:Tablet computers introduced in 2014 Category:Tablet computers introduced in 2015 ","title":"ThinkPad 10"},{"id":"42752924","text":"Health Level Seven International (HL7) is a non-profit ANSI-accredited standards development organization dedicated to providing standards and solutions that empower global health data interoperability. The 2.x versions of the standards are the most commonly used in the world. Organization The HL7 community is organized in the form of a global organization (Health Level Seven International, Inc.) and country-specific affiliate organizations: *Health Level Seven International, Inc. (HL7) is headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan. *HL7 has members from over 50 countries, including 500+ corporate members representing healthcare providers, government stakeholders, payers, pharmaceutical companies, vendors/suppliers, and consulting firms. *HL7 affiliate organizations, not-for-profit organizations incorporated in local jurisdictions, exist in over 30 countries. The first affiliate organization was created in Germany in 1993. *Strategic goals and initiatives are presented in HL7's Strategic Plan. The organizational structure of HL7 is as follows: *The organization is managed by a Board of Directors, which comprises 10 elected positions and three appointed positions. For information on the current board of directors visit hl7.org. The Chief Executive Officer (currently Charles Jaffe, MD, PhD) serves as an ex officio member of and reports to the Board of Directors. The Chief Technology Officer (currently Wayne Kubick); and the Chief Operations Officer (currently Mark McDougall) report to the CEO and also serve as ex officio members on the Board of Directors. *The organization consists of more than 40 work groups that are responsible for defining the HL7 standard protocols.  Each work group is chaired by two or more co-chairs and is organized into four functional groups called steering divisions.  Each steering division elects two representatives to serve on the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which votes on technical issues related to standards.  TSC also includes two representatives from HL7 affiliates and an Architectural Review Board representative. =Origin= HL7 was founded in 1987 to produce a standard for the exchange of data with hospital information systems. Donald W. Simborg, the CEO of Simborg Systems took the initiative to create the HL7 organization with the aim to allow for wider use of its own exchange protocol (known as the StatLAN protocol, originally defined at the University of California, San Francisco in the late 1970s). Membership initially consisted of those that had already implemented the StatLAN protocol. The name \\"Health Level-7\\" is a reference to the seventh layer of the ISO OSI Reference model also known as the application layer. The name indicates that HL7 focuses on application layer protocols for the health care domain, independent of lower layers. HL7 effectively considers all lower layers merely as tools. HL7 is one of several American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) operating in the healthcare arena.http://www.ansi.org/ ANSI Most of these SDOs produce standards (sometimes called specifications or protocols) for a particular healthcare domain such as pharmacy, medical devices, imaging or insurance (claims processing) transactions. Health Level Seven‚Äôs domain is clinical and administrative data. =Collaboration and initiatives= HL7 collaborates with other standards development organizations and national and international sanctioning bodies (e.g. ANSI and ISO), in both the healthcare and information infrastructure domains to promote the use of supportive and compatible standards. HL7 collaborates with healthcare information technology users to ensure that HL7 standards meet real-world requirements, and that appropriate standards development efforts are initiated by HL7 to meet emergent requirements. HL7 has been adopted by ISO as a center of gravity in international standardization and has been accredited as a partnering organization for mutual issuing of standards. The first mutually published standard is ISO/HL7 21731:2006 Health informatics‚ÄîHL7 version 3‚ÄîReference information model‚ÄîRelease 1. = Accelerator Program = In February 2019, HL7 launched the FHIR Accelerator Program designed to assist implementers across the health care spectrum in the creation of FHIR implementation guides or other informative documents. The program is based on an innovative model piloted by the HL7 Argonaut Project (provider-provider and provider-patient) and the HL7 Da Vinci Project (payer-provider). The service will allow implementation communities to select a range of support solutions based on their own needs and resources, ranging from self-service templates and tools, to contracted project management, SME, and infrastructure service. = Argonaut Project = In 2014, HL7 launched the Argonaut Project along with members of the private sector to advance industry adoption of modern, open interoperability standards such as HL7 FHIR. This effort follows on recommendations from the Joint HIT Standards and Policy Committee's JASON Task Force Report, the HIT Standards Committee‚Äôs NwHIN Power Team, the MITRE JASON Reports of 2013 and 2014, and the 2010 PCAST Report.  Standards  HL7 International specifies a number of flexible standards, guidelines, and methodologies by which various healthcare systems can communicate with each other. Such guidelines or data standards are a set of rules that allow information to be shared and processed in a uniform and consistent manner. These data standards are meant to allow healthcare organizations to easily share clinical information. Theoretically, this ability to exchange information should help to minimize the tendency for medical care to be geographically isolated and highly variable. HL7 International considers the following standards to be its primary standards ‚Äì those standards that are most commonly used and implemented: *Version 2.x Messaging Standard ‚Äì an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions *Version 3 Messaging Standard ‚Äì an interoperability specification for health and medical transactions * Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) ‚Äì an exchange model for clinical documents, based on HL7 Version 3 * Continuity of Care Document (CCD) ‚Äì a US specification for the exchange of medical summaries, based on CDA. * Structured Product Labeling (SPL) ‚Äì the published information that accompanies a medicine, based on HL7 Version 3 * Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW) ‚Äì an interoperability specification for the visual integration of user applications Other HL7 standards/methodologies include: * Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) ‚Äì a standard for the exchange of resources * Arden Syntax ‚Äì a grammar for representing medical conditions and recommendations as a Medical Logic Module (MLM) *Claims Attachments ‚Äì a Standard Healthcare Attachment to augment another healthcare transaction * Functional Models of Electronic Health Record (EHR) / Personal Health Record (PHR) systems ‚Äì a standardized description of health and medical functions sought for or available in such software applications * GELLO ‚Äì a standard expression language used for clinical decision support Processes  HL7 encompasses the complete life cycle of a standards specification including the development, adoption, market recognition, utilization, and adherence. In April, 2013, HL7's primary standards and other select products were made available for license at no cost. Most HL7 standards can now be deemed Open Standards.

The story also tells about the lonely woman Shanti and her landlord Marne, a lawyer and a bad poet who is madly in love with her. For monetary reasons, Ranga and his friend, Vashya, decides to bring home Shanti to meet Bapu to get them to start a quarrel. Because she is more powerful in quarrel, Ranga thinks she will win over Bapu in the quarrel, and that Bapu will lose his confidence, and they will therefore have their problem solved by getting money from Bapu. They tell each of Bapu and Shanti both that the other one is mentally out of control and that their lost spouses were exactly same looking as Bapu and Shanti, and if they come and have a big quarrel, the other patient might get cured. As planned, Shanti comes home to have a quarrel with Bapu, and Bapu get ready to do the same. But instead of having quarrels, the two lonely souls Bapu and Shanti fall in love. Bapu invites Shanti to stay at his place for a few days, and the situation becomes more complicated for Ranga and Vashya, and Marne too, as he can not recite his poems to Shanti. At the Bapu house, all the lonely characters come together eventually and become a family. But Marne gets more and more lonely with his poems and becomes a villain. As he comes to know of Ranga's plan, he blackmails him and lodges a court case against Bapu and Shanti.

In terms of its structure, it can also be regarded as benzo-fused cyclohexanone. It is a colorless oil with a faint odor. It is used as starting material for agricultural and pharmaceutical agents. The carbon skeleton of 1-tetralone is found in natural products such as Aristelegone A (4,7-dimethyl-6-methoxy-1-tetralone) from the family of Aristolochiaceae used in traditional Chinese medicine.  Preparation  =By oxidation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene = As already described in 1933 by Heinrich Hock, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene tends to autoxidize and gradually forms the 1-hydroperoxide with atmospheric oxygen. The heavy metal ion catalyzed air oxidation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene with Cr3+ or Cu2+ in the liquid phase leads via the hydroperoxide to a mixture of the intermediate 1-tetralol and the final product 1-tetralone. Oxidation von Tetraloin zu 1-Tetralon The boiling points of the main component 1-tetralone (255-257 ¬∞C) and the minor component 1-tetralol (255 ¬∞C) are virtually identical, the latter is therefore removed by a chemical reaction. =By Friedel-Crafts reactions= The starting compound 4-phenylbutanoic acid (whose sodium salt sodium phenylbutyrate is used to treat hyperammonaemia) is accessible from 3-benzoylpropanoic acid via catalytic hydrogenation, using a palladium contact catalyst. 3-Benzoylpropanoic acid itself can be obtained by a Haworth reaction (a variant of the Friedel-Crafts reaction) from benzene and succinic anhydride . The intramolecular cyclization of 4-phenylbutanoic acid to 1-tetralone is catalyzed by polyphosphoric acid and methanesulfonic acid.Cyclisierung von 4-Phenylbutters√§ure zu 1-Tetralon It has been described as a teaching experiment for chemistry lessons. 4-Phenylbutanoic acid can also be quantitatively converted into 1-tetralone by heating in the presence of a strong Lewis acid catalyst such as bismuth(III)bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide [Bi(NTf2)3], which is relatively easily accessible. The use of the acid chloride and tin(IV) chloride (SnCl4) allows significantly shorter reaction times than the Friedel- Crafts acylation with 4-phenylbutanoic acid. Synthese von 1-Tetralon √ºber 4-Phenylbutters√§urechlorid 4-Phenylbutanoic acid chlorides with electron- donating groups can be cyclized to 1-tetralones under mild reaction conditions in yields greater than 90% using the strong hydrogen-bonding solvent hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). The AlCl3-catalyzed acylation of benzene with Œ≥-butyrolactone produces 1-tetralone.Synthesis of 1-tetralone using butyrolactone.  Reactions 1-Tetralone can be reduced via a Birch reduction with lithium in liquid ammonia to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene. The keto group can also be reduced to a secondary alcohol giving 1-tetralol, when a modified process is applied, using the addition of aqueous ammonium chloride solution after evaporation of the ammonia. Reaktionen von 1-Tetralon mit Li in Ammoniak With calcium in liquid ammonia, 1-tetralone is reduced to 1-tetralol at -33 ¬∞C in 81% yield. The methylene group in Œ±-position to the keto group is particularly reactive and can be converted with formaldehyde (in the form of the trimeric trioxane) to 2-methylene-1-tetralone in the presence of the trifluoroacetic acid salt of N-methylaniline with yields up to 91% . Synthese von 2-Methylen-1-tetralon aus 1-Tetralon The 2-methylene ketone is stable at temperatures below -5 ¬∞C, but fully polymerizes at room temperature within 12 hours. In the Pfitzinger reaction of 1-tetralone with isatin, a compound called tetrofan (3,4-dihydro-1,2-benzacridine-5-carboxylic acid) is formed.Synthese von Tetrophan The reactivity of the Œ±-methylene group is also exploited in the reaction of 1-tetralone with methanol at 270-290 ¬∞C, which produces via dehydrogenation and formation of the aromatic naphthalene ring system 2-methyl-1-naphthol in 66% yield. Synthese von 2-Methyl-1-naphthol The oxime of 1-tetralone reacts with acetic anhydride leading to aromatization of the cycloalkanone ring. The resulting N-(1-naphthyl)acetamide has biological properties akin to those of 2-(1-Naphthyl)acetic acid as a synthetic auxin. Synthese von N-(1-Naphthyl)acetamid The tertiary alcohol formed in the Grignard reaction of 1-tetralone with phenylmagnesium bromide reacts with acetic anhydride upon elimination of water to 1-phenyl-3,4-dihydronaphthalene, which is dehydrated with elemental sulfur in an overall yield of about 45% to 1-phenylnaphthalene. Synthese von 1-Phenylnaphthalin aus 1-Tetralon The ruthenium(II)-catalyzed arylation of 1-tetralone using phenyl boronic acid neopentyl glycol ester gives 8-phenyl-1-tetralone in up to 86% yield. Synthese von 8-Phenyl-1-tetralon aus 1-Tetralon With 5-aminotetrazole and an aromatic aldehyde, 1-tetralone reacts in a multi-component reaction under microwave irradiation to form a four-membered heterocyclic ring system. Multikomponentenreaktion von 1-Tetralon mit Aminotetrazol und aromatischem Aldehyd Applications By far the most important application of 1-tetralone is in the synthesis of 1-naphthol by aromatization, e.g. upon contact with platinum catalysts at 200 to 450 ¬∞C. Synthese von 1-Naphthol aus 1-Tetralon 1-Naphthol is the starting material for the insecticides carbaryl and the beta-blockers propranolol.

Camille Lepage (January 28, 1988 - May 12, 2014) was a French photojournalist who was killed during the conflict in the Central African Republic in 2014. Her death was described as a murder by the French presidency and it marked the first death of a Western journalist in the conflict.  Early life and career  After completing her secondary education in Coll√®ge Saint-Martin in Angers, Lepage went on to study journalism in Southampton Solent University, during which she completed an Erasmus year in Utrecht's University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands. She later specialized in photojournalism and worked independently in Africa, most notably in Egypt, South Sudan and the Central African Republic. After finishing her degree in Southampton, she moved and based herself in South Sudan's capital Juba in July 2012, a year and a half before arriving to Bangui (CAR's capital) where she spent the last few months of her life. She opened up about her interests in conflicts and photojournalism in an interview a year before her death, where she was asked about her top moments of her career to date and she responded, \\"Not sure I can talk about my 'career' just yet, I‚Äôm still just getting started! I find it amazing to be able to travel probably to some of the most remote areas, meet wonderful people everywhere and being able to document them.\\" She was a well- known photojournalist and her work has been published in several news outlets, such as : The New York Times, The Guardian, Le Monde, The Washington Post, Der Spiegel, Lib√©ration, Le Nouvel Observateur, La Croix, The Sunday Times, The Wall Street Journal, Vice Magazine, Al Jazeera and was widely used by BBC. She had also worked for several non-governmental organizations including : WFP, Enough Project, UNESCO, Internews, Crown Agents, Deloitte, Amnesty International and M√©decins sans Fronti√®res. Lepage spoke passionately about the seriousness of the news stories surrounding the Central African Republic conflict that are not covered by the mainstream media: \\"I can‚Äôt accept that people‚Äôs tragedies are silenced simply because no one can make money out of them,\\" she said. \\"I decided to do it myself, and bring some light to them no matter what.\\"  Death  In November 2013, the UN warned the Central African Republic was at risk of spiraling into genocide, was \\"descending into complete chaos\\". and France described the country as \\"...on the verge of genocide\\". A week before her death, Lepage's last entries on Instagram and Twitter said that she was traveling by motorbike for hours with an anti-balaka militia down routes chosen to avoid checkpoints of African peacekeepers to Amada Gaza about 120 km away from Berb√©rati, where 150 people had been killed by S√©l√©ka rebels since March. On May 13, 2014, Lepage's body was found by French peacekeeping troops patrolling in the Bouar region west of the country in a vehicle driven by anti-balaka rebels.

Background Finch Motors ran a car sales yard. In response to a car they advertised for sale, the Quins viewed the car with the view of purchasing it. However, as they planned to use the car for towing a heavy boat, they informed the car yard that they wanted \\"a V8 motor car for pulling a heavy boat\\". After a brief inspection, and a short test drive, the Quins purchased the car. However, three days later, during their first trip with their car towing their boat, it overheated due to a latent defect with the radiator. They also discovered problems with the brakes and the steering, and on top of all this, it also had a blown gasket. Not satisfied with their recent purchase, they advised the car yard that they were returning the car, which was returned several days later. They cancelled the cheque, and refused the car yard's demands for payment for the car. The car yard eventually sued the Quins. Decision The court ruled that the defect in the radiator was latent, but that the car yard would have been aware of this defect at the time of the sale. The defective radiator made the car unsuitable for what the purchasers wanted to use the car for, namely for towing a boat. That being the case, the sale breached s 16(a) of the Sales of Goods Act 1908, and the Quins were entitled to return the car to the dealer. Footnote: The reason why this case is cited as \\"No. 2\\", is that this case is also cited in legal circles regarding the cancelled cheque which is known as case \\"No. 1\\".

He was of Scottish descent and was born in Dunnville village in Canada, where his father was a physician. He was educated at the University of Toronto. He graduated with BA in 1894. Initially inclined towards Greeks as academic career, his father influenced him to enter medicine. He joined the second year of the first batch of medicine course in the Johns Hopkins Medical School, and became one of the first graduates of the institute in 1897. He was appointed assistant resident of pathology of the medical school in 1897, resident pathologist in 1901, soon after Associate Professor, and full Professor in 1908. Between 1909 and 1917 he held a twin position of Professor of Pathology at Columbia University and the NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital. From 1917 to 1943 he held the Chair of Pathogy at Johns Hopkins University. MacCallum discovered the existence of two forms (now known to be male gamete or microgametocyte and female gamete or macrogametocyte) of malarial parasite in birds in 1897. In 1899 he and T.W. Hastings discovered a new species of pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria called Micrococcus zymogenes. He was the first to describe the structural and functional relationship between lymphatic system and connective tissue. In 1905 he discovered that thyroid and parathyroid glands had completely different functions. He found that muscle seizure (tetany) was due to abrogation of parathyroid glands, and that injection of calcium salt could restore the condition. This directly laid the understanding of the role of calcium in muscle contraction. In 1909 he discovered that a disease gastric tetany was not due to parathyroid functions, but because of blockage of the stomach-intestine connection called pylorus. He wrote a definitive textbook A Textbook of Pathology which ran several editions and is still in print. A histochemical staining technique for Gram-negative bacteria called McCullum- Goodpasture stain is jointly named after him and the co-discoverer Ernest William Goodpasture. A condition in rheumatic heart disease MacCallum plaque is named after him. Early life an education William MacCallum was born in Dunnville village to a physician father George A. MacCallum and mother Florence Eakins. His grandfather George MacCallum had emigrated from Scotland to Canada in his youth. He was the second of four children, with an elder sister, and a younger brother and a sister. (His brother John Bruce MacCallum would also become a physician but died at the age of thirty due to tuberculosis). He entered Dunnville public school and high school for his early education. He spent much of his free time accompanying his father, who was a general practitioner, in visiting resident patients. At 15 years of age he entered the University of Toronto, where his main interest was in Greeks, among his subjects such as zoology, chemistry, physics and geology. He graduated in 1894. His father's persuasion that he should take up medicine was his career-making event as he wanted to continue with Greeks for himself. By then he learned that the Johns Hopkins University had started Medical School in 1893 at Baltimore with its first batch of medical students. He applied for the medical course and was allowed to join the first batch, who were already in their second year, as it was decided that his education at Toronto was considered equivalent to the first year medical course. He was therefore member of the first class at Johns Hopkins who earned MD degree in 1897. Career MacCallum served a one-year internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital during 1897-1898, and was appointed assistant resident pathologist under William Henry Welch at the Johns Hopkins University. In 1900 he worked with Felix Jacob Marchand at the University of Leipzig in Germany. He returned to Baltimore in 1901 to become resident patholosgist and Associate Professor of Pathology. He was promoted to full Professor in 1908. Between 1909 and 1917 he was invited to Columbia University and NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital, where he simultaneously worked as Professor and pathologist respectively. In 1917 Welch resigned from the Chair of Pathology at Johns Hopkins University to assume the new post of Director at the School of Hygiene and Public Health. MacCallum was selected to take the vacant Chair, which he occupied until his retirement in 1943. He was designated Baxler Professor of Pathology in the university and pathologist to the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Achievements =Malariology= While he was studying in Baltimore, MacCallum used to spend his summer vacation at home in Dunville, where he and his father had, what he referred to as \\"a makeshift laboratory in the woodshed.\\" They would study specimens of all sorts collected from the country side. It was during his last year at Johns Hopkins Medical School, in the summer of 1896 that he made a pivotal discovery in malariology. It was the period of intense research to unravel the mode of transmission of malarial parasite, for which the leading contenders were British and Italian physicians. One day MacCallum collected blood sample far from his home, and in his home laboratory he observed active parasites called Halteridium columbae (but now considered as Haemoproteus columbae) among the blood cells. He went back to procure the bird itself and later found that the blood sample contained highly active malarial parasites. His reported his findings before the Medical Society of Johns Hopkins Hospital in November 1896, was published in 1897 in the Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital and more complete form in The Lancet. He diagnosed in the next summer research that protozoan infections such as Halteridium and Proteosoma were symptomatically similar, and produced pathogenic lesions as in human malaria. He further discovered that there were two groups of the parasite, one which are non-motile \\"granular\\" (now called microgametocytes) and one motile \\"hyaline\\" (macrogametocytes); and that the motile groups were flagellated cells having four or more arms that could fuse with the non-motile forms (the process of fertilisation) to form non-motile bodies called vermicule (but now called ookinete). This was the first description of sexual dimorphism and reproduction in the life cycle of prorotozoans. In his 1898 paper he gave a critical deduction that the motile forms were male gametes, the non-motile female gametes, and the vermicule the zygote (which were later proven to be true). He concluded with foresight that \\"This is a process which we might have expected and which I am confident will be found to occur in the case of the human malaria parasites... It is evidently for the human being what is foreshadowed by the organism of the bird. This was almost a Nobel Prize- winning work because the next year Ronald Ross of the Indian Medical Service demonstrated the transmission of bird malarial parasite (then Proteosoma but now Plasmodium relictum) by a mosquito (then Culex fatigans, but now Culex quinquefasciatus), for which Ross won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1902. =Bacteriology= In 1899 MacCallum and T.W. Hastings described a new species of pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium which they named Micrococcus zymogenes. The bacterium was discovered to be the causative agent of heart infection (acute endocarditis). The bacterium was a very small, occurred mainly in pairs, sometimes in short chains, and developed in small, pale, grayish-white colonies. It was uniquely capable of fermenting milk, hence, the name zymogenes. =Physiology= At the University of Leipzig in 1900 MacCallum studied the lymphatic system from the skin of pig embryo, and completed the work in Baltimore after two years. At the time the connection between lymphatic system and connective tissues was not known, and there were many speculations, of which the dominant idea was that they were directly linked. MacCallum showed that most of the prevailing hypotheses were wrong (such as connection through stomata, pores or canaliculi) and that the tissues had no special interconnecting link. Instead, solid particles are transported between them through cell transfer (phagocytosis). The lymphatic vessels were made up of endothelial lining structurally similar to normal blood vessels. In 1903 MacCallum started investigating thyroid and parathyroid secretions, for which there were confusion and uncertainty at the time. He discovered that the endocrine glands were of completely independent functions. He found that muscle seizure (tetany) thought to be due to surgery on thyroid was actually due to injury or removal of parathyroid glands; parathyroid contained no iodine in contrast to popular belief; and that injection of calcium salt could completely restore all the symptoms of tetany. His findings were published in 1905. In 1909, with Carl Voegtlin he finally established the direct importance of calcium in tetany, and thereby muscle contraction. From 1909 MacCallum investigated a unique tetanic condition called gastric tetany, in which parathyroid glands are normal. The disease was due to obstruction at the pylorus region (near the intestine) of the stomach. He found in dogs that under gastric tetany, gastric hydrochloric acid was lost, and the chlorine in the blood plasma was reduced causing severe electrolyte imbalance. This further caused increased electrical excitability of neurons leading to increased muscle twitching. In most severe cases violent convulsion occurred and the dogs die. These effects could be easily reversed by injecting chloride salts. His findings were reported before the American Society for Pathology in 1917, and published in full form in 1920. Pithotomy Club The symbol of the Pithotomy Club: The Drunken Baby During medical course at the Johns Hopkins MacCallum and classmate Joseph L. Nichols had rented a house at 1200 Guilford Avenue and as a housewarming celebration invited their teachers William H. Welch and William Osler, other faculty members, and friends to the house and entertained them with a keg of beer. These frequent gatherings evolved into a sort of club, for which MacCallum coined the name Pithotomy Club (from a combination of two Greek words pithos, meaning vessel, and otomos, meaning to open, which was taken to mean \\"to tap a keg\\"). The club's constitution, written in 1897, states its mission as to \\"facilitate the advancement of its members in the art and science of medicine by the promotion of social intercourse between the faculty and students of the Society,\\" in addition to a more humorous objective of \\"the promotion of vice among the virtuous, virtue among the vicious, and good fellowship among all.\\" It became one of the longest surviving academic clubs, and longest running medical club in history, and most of its members became successful doctors, including George Hoyt Whipple who received the 1943 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. After 95 years in 1992 it became defunct and the club building was donated to and absorbed by Johns Hopkins Medical School.

In 1892 a four-story section, seven bays wide, was added which has similar styling. The bays are grouped in fours, each separated by a strip of brick that rises the height of the building. Each section has a recessed entry, with a segmented arch overhead, and granite steps, wrought iron railing, and iron bootscrapers. The building was built as an investment property by Josiah Carpenter and Nehemiah Bean, prominent local businessmen and real estate developers. The land originally belonged to the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company, and was sold to Carpenter and Bean with the constraint that construction be of brick. It was designed by John T. Fanning, a prominent local architect with a number of significant regional industrial and residential commissions. It is his only known example of a tenement house. The building underwent a certified historic rehabilitation in 2001.

A version of this theorem predates the existence of scheme theory. It can be stated, proved, and applied in the following more classical setting. Let be a field, denote by \\\\mathbb{P}_k^n the -dimensional projective space over . The main theorem of elimination theory is the statement that for any and any algebraic variety defined over , the projection map V \\\\times \\\\mathbb{P}_k^n \\\\to V sends Zariski-closed subsets to Zariski-closed subsets. The main theorem of elimination theory is a corollary and a generalization of Macaulay's theory of multivariate resultant. The resultant of homogeneous polynomials in variables is the value of a polynomial function of the coefficients, which takes the value zero if and only if the polynomials have a common non-trivial zero over some field containing the coefficients. This belongs to elimination theory, as computing the resultant amounts to eliminate variables between polynomial equations. In fact, given a system of polynomial equations, which is homogeneous in some variables, the resultant eliminates these homogeneous variables by providing an equation in the other variables, which has, as solutions, the values of these other variables in the solutions of the original system. A simple motivating example The affine plane over a field is the direct product A_2=L_x\\\\times L_y of two copies of . Let :\\\\pi\\\\colon L_x\\\\times L_y \\\\to L_x be the projection :(x,y)\\\\mapsto \\\\pi(x,y)=x. This projection is not closed for the Zariski topology (nor for the usual topology if k= \\\\R or k= \\\\C), because the image by \\\\pi of the hyperbola of equation xy-1=0 is L_x\\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, which is not closed, although is closed, being an algebraic variety. If one extends L_y to a projective line P_y, the equation of the projective completion of the hyperbola becomes :xy_1-y_0=0, and contains :\\\\overline\\\\pi(0,(1,0))=0, where \\\\overline\\\\pi is the prolongation of \\\\pi to L_x\\\\times P_y. This is commonly expressed by saying the origin of the affine plane is the projection of the point of the hyperbola that is at infinity, in the direction of the -axis. More generally, the image by \\\\pi of every algebraic set in L_x\\\\times L_y is either a finite number of points, or L_x with a finite number of points removed, while the image by \\\\overline\\\\pi of any algebraic set in L_x\\\\times P_y is either a finite number of points or the whole line L_y. It follows that the image by \\\\overline\\\\pi of any algebraic set is an algebraic set, that is that \\\\overline\\\\pi is a closed map for Zariski topology. The main theorem of elimination theory is a wide generalization of this property. Classical formulation For stating the theorem in terms of commutative algebra, one has to consider a polynomial ring R[\\\\mathbf x]=R[x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n] over a commutative Noetherian ring , and a homogeneous ideal generated by homogeneous polynomials f_1,\\\\ldots, f_k. (In the original proof by Macaulay, was equal to , and was a polynomial ring over the integers, whose indeterminates were all the coefficients of thef_i\\\\mathrm s.) Any ring homomorphism \\\\varphi from into a field , defines a ring homomorphism R[\\\\mathbf x] \\\\to K[\\\\mathbf x] (also denoted \\\\varphi), by applying \\\\varphi to the coefficients of the polynomials. The theorem is: there is an ideal \\\\mathfrak r in , uniquely determined by , such that, for every ring homomorphism \\\\varphi from into a field , the homogeneous polynomials \\\\varphi(f_1),\\\\ldots, \\\\varphi(f_k) have a nontrivial common zero (in an algebraic closure of ) if and only if \\\\varphi(\\\\mathfrak r)=\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}. Moreover, \\\\mathfrak r =0 if , and \\\\mathfrak r is principal if . In this latter case, a generator of \\\\mathfrak r is called the resultant of f_1,\\\\ldots, f_k. Hints for a proof and related results Using above notation, one has first to characterize the condition that \\\\varphi(f_1),\\\\ldots, \\\\varphi(f_k) do not have any non-trivial common zero. This is the case if the maximal homogeneous ideal \\\\mathfrak m = \\\\langle x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n\\\\rangle is the only homogeneous prime ideal containing \\\\varphi(I)=\\\\langle \\\\varphi(f_1),\\\\ldots, \\\\varphi(f_k)\\\\rangle. Hilbert's Nullstellensatz asserts that this is the case if and only if \\\\varphi(I) contains a power of each x_i, or, equivalently, that \\\\mathfrak m^d \\\\subseteq \\\\varphi(I) for some positive integer . For this study, Macaulay introduced a matrix that is now called Macaulay matrix in degree . Its rows are indexed by the monomials of degree in x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n, and its columns are the vectors of the coefficients on the monomial basis of the polynomials of the form m\\\\varphi(f_i), where is a monomial of degree d-\\\\deg(f_i). One has \\\\mathfrak m^d \\\\subseteq \\\\varphi(I) if and only if the rank of the Macaulay matrix equals the number of its rows. If , the rank of the Macaulay matrix is lower than the number of its rows for every , and, therefore, \\\\varphi(f_1),\\\\ldots, \\\\varphi(f_k) have always a non-trivial common zero. Otherwise, let d_i be the degree of f_i, and suppose that the indices are chosen in order that d_2\\\\ge d_3 \\\\ge\\\\cdots\\\\ge d_k\\\\ge d_1. The degree :D= d_1+d_2+\\\\cdots+d_n-n+1 = 1+\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (d_i-1) is called Macaulay's degree or Macaulay's bound because Macaulay's has proved that \\\\varphi(f_1),\\\\ldots, \\\\varphi(f_k) have a non- trivial common zero if and only if the rank of the Macaulay matrix in degree is lower than the number to its rows. In other words, the above may be chosen once for all as equal to . Therefore, the ideal \\\\mathfrak r, whose existence is asserted by the main theorem of elimination theory, is the zero ideal if , and, otherwise, is generated by the maximal minors of the Macaulay matrix in degree . If , Macaulay has also proved that \\\\mathfrak r is a principal ideal (although Macaulay matrix in degree is not a square matrix when ), which is generated by the resultant of \\\\varphi(f_1),\\\\ldots, \\\\varphi(f_n). This ideal is also generically a prime ideal, as it is prime if is the ring of integer polynomials with the all coefficients of \\\\varphi(f_1),\\\\ldots, \\\\varphi(f_k) as indeterminates. Geometrical interpretation In the preceding formulation, the polynomial ring R[\\\\mathbf x]=R[x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n] defines a morphism of schemes (which are algebraic varieties if is finitely generated over a field) :\\\\mathbb{P}^{n-1}_R = \\\\operatorname{Proj}(R[\\\\mathbf x]) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec}(R). The theorem asserts that the image of the Zariski- closed set defined by is the closed set . Thus the morphism is closed.

From 1929 to 1931 it took part in the annual national gliding contests held on the Wasserkuppe, often known as the Rh√∂n contests. Design and development A relaxation in 1924 of the restrictions on aircraft building imposed on Germany after World War I allowed the development powered aircraft. Germany's relatively advanced glider constructors were concerned that this threatened to end their sport and some turned their attention to the possibilities of motor gliders. In about 1927 the Berlin Segelflug-Verein (BSV) began the design of such an aircraft with their new designer Otto Hohmuth. The target was a low cost machine for the 1928 Rh√∂n contest, simple to build and without the long span wings of the highest performing gliders, but they underestimated the costs and construction time. An engine was never fitted and the final output, the Luftikus, first flew in May 1929. It was a parasol wing glider, though the three part wooden wing was a cantilever structure, held above the fuselage on two almost vertical streamlined steel struts from the fuselage, one on either side and by further central, vertical struts, faired in to form a slender ply skinned central pylon. The centre section was rectangular in plan, occupying about one third of the span; the outer sections were double tapered to semicircular tips. The wing was built around a single spar with plywood skin from it forward around the leading edge forming a torsion resistant box. On the centre section the ply skin extended rearwards to diagonal auxiliary spars and on the lower surface of the outer panels to the aileron hinge. The rest of the wing surface, including the long ailerons was fabric covered. The wood framed, unusually narrow fuselage was hexagonal in cross section forward of its deepest point under the wing but rectangular aft. The open cockpit positioned the pilot's headrest immediately under the wing leading edge. Aft, the fuselage tapered, more strongly in depth than height. The areas of the fin and tailplane were very small, but the rudder was broad and almost a quadrant, cut away below to allow operation of the long, narrow, balanced one piece elevator. The third example had some small rudder modifications, with a bigger hinge gap and a flatter top. Like the ailerons, the rear control surfaces were fabric covered. A , rubber sprung landing skid reached back towards the wing trailing edge, assisted by a pair of looped tubes acting as a tail skid. Two other copies of the Luftikus were built. One was used by the Magdeburg police glider club and another, built by Hans Bohnert, was shot down during the German invasion of Norway. Operational history At the 1929 Rh√∂n the Luftikus was piloted by Otto Bedau who was only allowed to fly in the B category as he had not then achieved the five minutes of soaring flight required to compete in the highest class C. He went on to win in the B class with flights of over six minutes and a maximum altitude of . Bedau flew the Luftikus in the next two Rh√∂ns, finishing runner-up in 1930. On the last day of that competition he was lifted by the updraught under a cumulus cloud to above ground, where the controls froze. Finally recovering control at he continued his flight, staying airborne for 7 hours and 34 minutes and landing after the end of the event. He also pioneered wire towed launches (\\"American wire cable flying\\") in Europe behind a car or powered aircraft and gave a demonstration of double aerotowing at the 1931 Rh√∂n. Later, in Berlin, Bedau and the Luftikus were part of the first triple aerotow.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, and was home to the local chapter of the American Red Cross for approximately 71 years from the start of WWII. Today it is a privately owned office building protected by the Manchester Historic Association and known as the Carpenter Historic Building, LLC, which recently completed an award- winning historic renovation to the Carriage House onsite to bring back the stable and carriage entrance and former original living space for the caretaker now in use as office space. The building is a local point of interest to visitors of Manchester and part of the Manchester Historic Association's guided tours of Manchester historic homes and people. It is open to public viewing during working hours. Description and history The Frank Pierce Carpenter House is located north of downtown Manchester, at the northwest corner of Elm Street (U.S. Route 3) and North Street. The house is roughly square in shape, with a three-story turret at its southeast corner and a projecting window bay at its southwest corner. A 2-1/2 story ell which originally housed service facilities projects to the west. The main (eastern) facade is three bays wide: the turret occupies the left bay, and the main entrance the center. The entry is sheltered by a single-story porch supported by clustered Tuscan columns (replacements c. 1970 for originals styled like those on the building's porte-cochere). The interior is lavishly decorated with period woodwork and imported marble. The house was built in 1891 for Frank Carpenter, then the president of the Amoskeag Paper Company, and a major city benefactor. It was probably designed by Edgar A. P. Newcomb, who Carpenter had hired to design the city's Carpenter Memorial Library. The multi-acre estate that Carpenter amassed around the house was sold off in portions after his death in 1938, and the house was given a temporary lease of the property during World War II. This lease was made effectively permanent after the war, and the property was formally transferred to the Red Cross in 1993 by Carpenter's heirs, subject to preservation easements.

Description and history The Amos Chase House and Mill are located in northern Weare, on the west side of New Hampshire 114 just south of its crossing of the Piscataquog River. The house is oriented facing the road, while the mill is behind it, on the bank of the river. The house is a 2¬Ω-story Greek Revival structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It has two similar five-bay facades (southeast and northeast) with central entries framed by pilasters and topped by architraves. The adjacent mill building is also a wood-frame structure, with a flat roof and clapboarded exterior. Both buildings have seen only modest and superficial alteration since their construction. Elements of the raceways providing water to the mill are still in evidence outside the building, and a stone dam built by Amos Chase spans the river. The mill is the only surviving 19th-century mill building in Weare, out of a cottage industry that once saw a dozen or more such buildings. The house was built about 1836 by Amos Chase, as was a mill. That mill burned in 1844; the present mill was built by Chase as a replacement a few years later. This mill was the only one in the town to survive the New England Hurricane of 1938, although its waterwheel was washed away. Amos Chase was a tool manufacturer, one of several members of a locally prominent family operating small mills in the town. His son later used the mill in the manufacture of baskets.

George, Lord Gordon came into possession of the lands in 1467, but Thomas Gray of Scheves occupied the land by 1509. It is thought that this family built the present castle. By 1721 the Forbes family owned the castle, and altered it internally. It had become a farmhouse by the late 19th century. After it was burned out in 1900 it was restored for Lord Aberdeen by Sydney Mitchell, in 1902. Thomas Catto, 1st Baron Catto subsequently had the castle embellished by J Fenton Wyness, an antiquarian architect. The original building has been attributed to Thomas Leper, around 1585. The north east tower, three storeys high, was added in about 1750, by the Forbeses, and a western extension to the main block in 1780. Structure House of Schivas is a tall tower house. A modern courtyard surrounds it, replacing the original. A wide circular stair tower projecting from the north front of the main block gives access to all floors, while a stair tower in the re-entrant angle rises from the first floor level.

He was wounded at the battles of L√ºtzen, Leipzig and Waterloo. In 1829 he left the Prussian Army at the rank of captain to become a staff officer in the Russian army, a role he held for a year. In 1832, as an artillery officer, he was severely wounded serving in the defence of Antwerp. =Spain= He was in England in early 1837 when he received an offer to enlist in the Carlist army. In April 1837 he arrived in Navarre to cross the Pyrenees into Spain. He was taken to join the Carlist siege of San Sebasti√°n, which had been ongoing since 1835. A few days before his arrival the Carlists had won a victory at Oriamendi, beating off a Liberal force trying to lift the siege. Days later he was received by Infante Sebastian, commander of the northern Carlist forces, at his headquarters in Hernani. He later said that he had read of this general's exploits in the newspapers and was disappointed to find out that he was in fact an old-looking young man, almost bald, with a short beard and no military bearing, who avoided speaking of the war itself and instead merely spoke admiringly about Napoleon I and Frederick the Great. von Rahden concludes his account by realising that Prince Sebastian was comparing himself with these two men and adds: He received orders to march to Estella to present himself to the Infante Carlos (the Carlist claimant to the Spanish throne) - Carlos had established his court there and was preparing to launch the 'Expedici√≥n Real' (Royal Expedition) to capture Madrid and take the throne. Wearing a flamboyant Dutch Army uniform (the last uniform with which he had been issued ) and his four medals to date, von Rahden was presented to Carlos on 10 May. On their first meeting, Carlos promoted him to lieutenant colonel, which was a major surprise for von Rahden, as he had never held the intervening rank of major. Other Germans on the Carlist side had similar experiences, leading von Rahden to comment that things went faster in the Carlist army than in the Prussian one. The other Germans included prince Felix Lichnowsky, who had joined the Carlist forces three months earlier and been made brigadier general aged only 23. On 15 May 1837 the Carlist expedition crossed the river Arga heading east, making their planned advance to the north of Aragon in an attempt to join up with existing Carlist forces in Catalonia, seize power and establish a Carlist regime there, cross the river Ebro and (in combination with Ram√≥n Cabrera's forces, then dominating the Maestrazgo) assault Madrid. =Retirement= Title page of the third part of his memoirs (Wanderungen eines alten Soldaten).

The film, which marks Akkineni Nageswara Rao's last on screen appearance is also Anup Rubens' 25th film as a Music Director. Vanamali, Chandrabose and Anup Rubens himself provided lyrics for the 5 out of 6 songs in the album and the remaining one being the Theme Music of the film. The soundtrack album released on 9 May 2014 on Aditya Music label. Upon release, the soundtrack album received huge applause from critics and audience with many critics opining it as the best work of Anoop Rubens till date. As a result of the positive reviews and responses for this soundtrack, Anoop Rubens received his maiden Filmfare Award for Best Music Director. Development In mid March 2013, Anup Rubens was recruited to compose music for the film marking his second collaboration with Vikram Kumar after Ishq and Naga Chaitanya after Autonagar Surya and this film also marked his biggest project till date by then. In a press note released in the end of November 2013 which spoke about the film's shoot in Coorg mentioned that Chandrabose and Vanamali would provide the lyrics for the songs of the film. The film also marks Anoop Rubens 25th film as a Music composer. In mid February 2014, it was reported that the hit song Oka Laila Kosam would be remixed in the film but an official statement was awaited for that. However, verses of the song Nenu Putanu were used in the song Piyo Piyo Re. Track listing The official Track list was released on 8 May 2014 by Nagarjuna himself on Twitter. The tracklist featured 5 songs and a theme music with Vanamali, Chandrabose and Anup Rubens penning the lyrics and popular singers Shreya Ghoshal, Arijit Singh, Chaitra H. G., Haricharan and Jaspreet Jasz providing the vocals along with new singers. Release In the second week of May, it was reported that the soundtrack album of the film would be released directly into the market on 9 May 2014 without hosting any audio function as a mark of respect for Akkineni Nageswara Rao. The official Track list was released on 8 May 2014 by Nagarjuna himself on Twitter. The Track list released then also confirmed that Aditya Music won the audio rights of the film. The film's audio was launched on 9 May 2014 by Aditya Music's streaming section in YouTube instead of opting for a promotional audio launch event. Marketing On 26 April 2014 the song Piyo Piyo Re was released fully with lyrics into the internet officially by Nagarjuna as a part of the film's promotion. The song was a remixed version of the song Nenu Puttanu from Akkineni Nageswara Rao's evergreen film Prem Nagar. After the audio's release, the positive reception of the song Chinni Chinni Aasalu prompted the makers to release the making video of that song which featured Nagarjuna and Shriya Saran. Shot in the backdrop of a village the song featured Nagarjuna dressed as a farmer while Shriya Saran seemed like his innocent village wife. On the other hand, it also showcased the singers Shreya Ghoshal, Ashwin and Hari recording their parts for the songs. The making video too received positive response. The making of the song Kanulanu Thaake was released on 14 May 2014 which featured Naga Chaitanya and Samantha. The celebration of the audio's success was celebrated on 15 May 2014 by hosting a promotional event for the same. However, there was no live telecast of the event and it was telecasted on Gemini TV on 18 May 2014.

Both surface deformation and faulting and shaking- related geological effects (e.g., soil liquefaction, landslides) not only leave permanent imprints in the environment, but also dramatically affect human structures. Moreover, underwater fault ruptures and seismically- triggered landslides can generate tsunami waves. EEE represent a significant source of hazard, especially (but not exclusively) during large earthquakes. This was observed for example during more or less catastrophic seismic events recently occurred in very different parts of the world. Earthquake environmental effects are divided into two main types: Coseismic surface faulting induced by the 1915 Fucino, Central Italy, earthquake # Primary effects: which are the surface expression of the seismogenic source (e.g., surface faulting), normally observed for crustal earthquakes above a given magnitude threshold (typically =5.5‚Äì6.0); 2012 Emilia, Northern Italy, earthquakes # Secondary effects: mostly this is the intensity of the ground shaking (e.g., landslides, liquefaction, etc.).

Unlike those classified in the related genus Banksieaephyllum, the leaves do not have their cuticular architecture preserved. The genus was defined by botanists Bob Hill and David Christophel in 1988 to distinguish banksia-like leaves that had been organically preserved from those that had not. The two authors designated Banksieaeformis decurrens as the type species. Recovered from middle Eocene deposits at Maslin Bay in South Australia, it is known from a single leaf, 7 cm long and 1 cm wide. The leaf has entire margins in its basal half and pinnate lobes pointed apically in its apical half, which resembles the leaves of the fossil species Banksieaephyllum cuneatum and B. incisum, as well as the living species Banksia grandis, B. baxteri and B. drummondii. However, the overall shape of the leaf does not resemble any living species. Banksieaeformis dentatus was described by Hill and Christophel from Late Eocene-Oligocene deposits from Cethana in northern Tasmania. These leaves are around 6 cm long and 1 cm wide, and have serrated margins, and resemble the living species Banksia serrata and B. burdettii. The venation is similar to the fossil species Banksieaephyllum attenuatum and B. fastigiatum, though these are a different shape. Researchers David Greenwood, Peter Haines and David Steart named three more species from Central Australia in 2001: Banksieaeformis serratus, recovered from Paleogene strata at Glen Helen near Alice Springs, resembles the living Banksia serrata, Banksieaeformis langii, recovered from three sites (Stuart Creek, Woomera and Jacks Hill) in northern South Australia, has long narrow lobed leaves at least 8.5 cm long and only 1.2-1.6 cm wide resembling Banksia formosa, and Banksieaeformis praegrandis, also from South Australia, has large leaves with long narrow widely spaced lobes reminiscent of Banksia chamaephyton.

An overview of networks An undirected network of 6 nodes and 7 edges. In the context of network theory a network is graph (network) that uses encodes the components of a system and their interactions. Each component in a system is represented with a node, and their connections between each other are represented with corresponding edges. Networks can be either random or non-random, they may depict complex or simple structures, and their edges may be directed or undirected. Networks are particularly useful in depicting and analyzing complex systems. Networks examples: *The social network of all professional, friendship, and family ties. *The network describing the interactions between genes, proteins, and metabolites integrate the processes behind living cells. *The network describing which communication devices interact with each other, capturing internet connections or wireless links, is the heart of the modern communication system. *The power grid, a network of generators and transmission lines, supplies with energy virtually all modern technology.The Network Science Book Project --> iBook --> Page 8 http://barabasilab.neu.edu/networksciencebook/ Spreading processes Content in a complex network can spread via two major methods: conserved spread and non-conserved spread.Newman, M., Barab√°si, A.-L., Watts, D.J. [eds.] (2006) The Structure and Dynamics of Networks. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press. In conserved spread, the total amount of content that enters a complex network remains constant as it passes through. In non-conserved spread, the amount of content changes as it enters and passes through a complex network. The non-conserved model is the most suitable for explaining the transmission of most infectious diseases, neural excitation, information and rumors, etc. SARS overview Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease originating in southern China eventually infecting 8,273 and killing 775 people worldwide, between November 2002 and July 2003. On 16 November 2002, the first official case of SARS was recorded in Guangdong Province, China.https://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_21/en.html The People's Republic of China (PRC) notified the World Health Organization (WHO) about the outbreak four months later, on February 10, after 305 recorded cases and 5 deaths;World Health Organization. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_21/en/index.html In those four months, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was thought to be the first new, easily transmissible infectious disease of the twenty-first century. SARS as a network The severity of the symptoms and the infection of hospital staff alarmed global health authorities, fearful of another emergent epidemic. On 12 March 2003, the WHO issued a global alert, followed by a health alert by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). SARS spread from China to 25 countries and Taiwan, seeding itself in localities in Toronto, Ottawa, San Francisco, Ulan Bator, Manila, Singapore, Taiwan, Hanoi and Hong Kong whereas within China it spread to Guangdong, Jilin, Hebei, Hubei, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Tianjin, and Inner Mongolia. Panic was evident, as there was great uncertainty about its causes, cure, and most important its level of contagion. Panic was not only concentrated among the public. Mathematical epidemiologists originally estimated the virus would between infect between 30,000 and 10 million persons, within the first 120 days. Despite this estimate SARS has not emerged as a global pandemic. Instead, initial seeding of the virus was followed by intense but tightly circumscribed activity in some locales with only scant activity in others. It turned out that only 782 cases were reported during those initial three months.http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/papers/mpnsb.pdf There were some crucial features of SARS that greatly facilitated the global containment of the disease. Firstly, patients are infectious only after they exhibit symptoms. As a result, some researchers feel ‚ÄòSARS might almost be classified as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to manage‚Äô. Another feature of SARS favourable to its containment is its transmission via large droplets (as opposed to small droplets or aerosols), requiring close contact. Many infectious diseases spread through populations via the networks formed by physical contacts among individuals. SARS is no different. One of the striking features of the SARS epidemic was the manner in which airline networks acted as corridors for the spread of the disease. From its onset it became clear that the role of air transport in the diffusion of the disease was key. This is why, despite its relatively low level of contagion, the SARS Network still managed to become a large diameter network. It is true that the origin of the virus being connected with such an important node, like Hong Kong, made it especially prone to diffusion by air travel. Moreover, had a similar disease originated in a less connected node, like Central Africa, one would not expect the virus to infect such an extended part of the network. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the world was ill- prepared to mitigate the diffusion of SARS via international air transport, and should another virus both come to infect an important node in the global transportation network, and be relatively contagious, epidemic or even pandemic may ensue.

Since 2016 it is being used as a Mosque. Architecture The church is built in brick (red on the front and brown on the sides) with sandstone dressings and a slate roof. It has a rectangular plan with its entrance on the east side, a small addition to the rear, and is in two storeys with a basement. At the entrance front is a projecting single-storey porch, wider than the body of the church, in five bays. It stands on a stone plinth, is symmetrical, and contains three round-headed doorways approached by steps, all with moulded architraves and fanlights. The central doorway has two pairs of Tuscan columns, and the outer doorways are flanked by pilasters. Between the doorways are round-headed windows with architraves, and there are similar but larger windows on the sides of the porch. Above the doorways is a continuous frieze and cornice. Above the outer windows and on the sides of the porch is a balustrade. The upper storey contains five windows with round moulded heads, and a band of square panels above them. At the top is a pediment containing a stone inscribed with the date of original building. Along the sides of the church are five bays with two tiers of round headed windows.

The burlesque companies would travel in succession round a \\"wheel\\" of theaters, ensuring steady employment for performers and a steady supply of new shows for the participating theaters. For much of its history the Columbia Wheel advertised relatively \\"clean\\" variety shows featuring pretty girls. Eventually the wheel was forced out of business due to competition from its rival, the Mutual Burlesque Association, cinemas, and cruder stock burlesque companies. The bottom three floors of the Columbia Amusement Company's building was the Columbia Theatre NYC, a show piece and great hall known to burlesquers and vaudevillians as \\"The Home of Burlesque Deluxe\\". Background In 1897, the burlesque producers and theater managers incorporated the Traveling Variety Managers of America (TVMA)--with the purpose of bettering the business of traveling variety managers and for benevolent, literary and fraternal purposes. The directors were Thomas E. Miaco, Henry C. Jacobs and Thomas E. McCready. Among the incorporators were Gus Hill, Phil Sheridan, Frank D. Bryan, George W. Rice and Fred Irwin.Poughkeepsie Eagle-News (Poughkeepsie, NY) 'Traveling Variety Managers-New Organization' 23 Jul 1897 Page 2 Column 1. The idea was that approved shows would progress from one theater to another in succession, round a \\"wheel\\".The vaudeville and burlesque producer Gus Hill claimed credit for the concept.The theaters would not have to compete for shows, and the burlesque companies would have guaranteed work. The TVMA soon split into two wheels, one in the west and the other in the east.However--the two wheels EMPIRE and COLUMBIA would later merge [1913] under the name Columbia Amusement Company. Formation 1911 cartoon depicting Sam A. Scribner and the Columbia Wheel Sixteen managers and producers incorporated the Columbia Amusement Company on 12 July 1902. They had left the TVMA to set up a more stable operation. The lead was taken by Sam A. Scribner. Other principals were William S. Campbell, William S. Drew, Gus Hill, John Herbert Mack, Harry Morris, L. Lawrence Weber and A. H. Woodhill. The circuit had headquarter in New York and included the larger cities east of the Missouri and north of the Ohio such as Philadelphia and Pittsburg. It included Montreal and Toronto in Canada, and Boston in the east. Since the theaters were in the east, the Columbia Wheel was also called the Eastern Wheel. Another circuit was formed in the west, called the Empire Circuit or Western Wheel. Early years The Columbia organizers at first aimed to provide affordable shows that were acceptable to women and men. They advertised \\"clean\\" or \\"refined\\" burlesque. They included lines of chorus girls and slightly risqu√© comedians, but did not go so far as to give offense. The Columbia Wheel's refined burlesque shows had multi-act vaudeville-style programs that included farces, comedians, skits and variety acts. In August 1905 Will Rogers signed up with Scribner for five one-week shows in Brooklyn, New York, Buffalo, Cleveland and Pittsburg. Although the wheel system made the industry more stable, the shows became standardized. New costumes and acts were expensive, and when performers became better known they often left for legitimate theater. Performers who started in burlesque included Weber & Fields, Bert Lahr, W. C. Fields, Red Skelton, Rose Sydell, Sophie Tucker, Fanny Brice, and Mollie Williams. Many of them moved into musical comedy or vaudeville as soon as they could. But the audiences still came to see the girls, and burlesque remained profitable. Columbia Theatre at Broadway & 47th in 1920, \\"Home of Burlesque De Luxe\\" The Star and Garter opened in Chicago in 1908, providing \\"Clean Entertainment for Self-Respecting People\\". On 10 January 1910 the Columbia Amusement Company opened the Columbia Theatre, \\"Home of Burlesque De Luxe\\", at Broadway and 47th Street in Manhattan. The theater was designed by William H. McElfatrick and had a capacity of 1,385. The company owned and operated it. The Columbia theater opening was well publicized and was attended by various dignitaries. Evolution Song book cover for Gus Hill's Mutt and Jeff in Panama. After \\"cartoon theatricals\\" like this finished their run in vaudeville they often moved to Hill's burlesque franchises. The Empire pushed the legal limits with its \\"hot\\" shows. The Columbia often lowered its standards and competed directly with the Empire. In 1913 the Eastern and Western wheels were consolidated into the Columbia Amusement Company, headed by Samuel Scribner and Isidore Herk. The combined operation put on fairly clean shows, as had the Eastern Wheel. The Columbia Wheel now had two large burlesque circuits. Another wheel started to compete with raunchier performances. In May 1915 the company transferred its No. 2 circuit, which had forty theaters and thirty- four touring companies, to a new subsidiary corporation called the American Burlesque Association. Gus Hill was named president of the new entity. The American Wheel offered rawer performances, with blue humor and suggestive dancing, and drove the competition out of business. In 1921 Scribner insisted that shows in the Columbia circuit include their own orchestras so they resembled the more respectable vaudeville shows, and banned smoking in the theaters. He also tried to ban the comedians from using double entendres, but with less success. A 1922 report said \\"the companies will come to town on the same day each week to offer what is declared to be comedies with music, musical shows with chorus girls or whatever may best describe clean, wholesome offerings that should not be confused with \\"burlesque\\" as it was presented when Dad was a young chap.\\" The Columbia Wheel avoided runways until its final years, although the subsidiary American Wheel offered cooch dancers performing on runways. In 1922 the American Wheel was dissolved due to an argument between Scribner and Herk and replaced by the Mutual Wheel. Herk headed up the Mutual. Performers for the Mutual Wheel became the first to expose their breasts. The Mutual put on less elaborate shows with more tease, although it generally did not include stripping. The Mutual grew fast, buying up Columbia theaters across the country. Decline and dissolution In 1923 Columbia still had thirty-eight shows, and was still the largest burlesque operation in the country. However, receipts were declining. By the mid-1920s cinemas were providing shows that combined film and live entertainment with ticket prices lower than any burlesque show. In the 1925 season Scribner authorized the removal of tights, and tableaux of bare-breasted women. Columbia continued to lose customers to other types of entertainment and to more explicit stock burlesque theaters. Columbia and Mutual merged in 1927 to form the United Burlesque Association. Herk, President of the Mutual Wheel, became President of the new combination, with Scribner, formerly president of the Columbia Wheel, as the Chairman of the Board.Buffalo Currier Express, January 15, 1928 The new organization comprised 44 theaters, and soon reverted to the name Mutual Burlesque.Brooklyn Standard Union August 2, 1929, pg. 8Philadelphia Inquirer May 19, 1929, pg 12 By the 1927‚Äì28 season the combined circuit was struggling financially. This was the last season where cartoon theatricals were a significant part of the burlesque shows. In 1930‚Äì31 the combined wheel decided to revive clean burlesque. The experiment failed and the circuit closed.

Jameson Distillery Bow St. is the original site where Jameson Irish Whiskey was distilled until 1971. It is now a visitors centre that provides guided tours, tutored whiskey tastings, JJs bar and a gift shop.  History  The original distillery on this site was called the Bow Street Distillery and was established in 1780. John Jameson took full ownership (he was previously the general manager) and expanded the distillery in 1805. By 1810, the operation was officially renamed to John Jameson & Son‚Äôs Bow Street Distillery. The distillery grew to upwards of 5 acres (2 ha) in size by 1886. The Bow St. distillery in 1887 At this time, it was described by many as a \\"city within a city\\". The distillery also housed a Smithy, Cooperage, saw mills, engineers, carpenters, painters and coppersmiths‚Äô shops. Water for the distillery came from two deep wells dug underneath the site. Cellars were also dug underneath nearby streets to store maturing whiskey, while four stills and two wash stills, each holding 24,000 gallons (109,000 L), were heated by both fire and steam coils above. Following a difficult period that included American Prohibition, Ireland‚Äôs trade war with Great Britain, and the introduction of Scotch blended whiskey, the Jameson distillery fell on hard times and decided to form the Irish Distillers Group with their previous rivals, the Cork Distilleries Company and John Power & Son in 1966. Eventually, it became one of the last distilleries in Ireland to close in 1971. The operation was then moved out of Dublin to the New Midleton Distillery.

R. Martin, published in the 2014 Bantam Spectra anthology Rogues. It is set on the continent of Westeros of Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, hundreds of years before the events of A Game of Thrones (1996) during the reign of King Viserys I Targaryen. The Rogue Prince serves as a prequel to Martin's 2013 novella The Princess and the Queen and focuses on the reign of Viserys I, from his grandfather Jaehaerys I Targaryen's death to his own. It chronicles the evolving relationship between Viserys and his brother Prince Daemon, and the king's plan for succession to his daughter from his first marriage even though he has a son from his second marriage, which cements a rivalry within the Targaryens that plays out in The Princess and the Queen. The work is presented as the writing of the fictional Archmaester Gyldayn, also the \\"author\\" of Martin's The Princess and the Queen. Plot Near the end of King Jaehaerys I's long reign, a succession crisis emerges when his second son Baelon dies, leading to a Great Council to decide who should be the old king's heir. Jaehaerys's elder son Aemon also died some years before, leaving behind a daughter named Rhaenys‚Äîbut there are many who prefer Baelon's 26 year old son Viserys, due to his gender. Despite standard succession law that the elder brother's children should come first, Viserys wins the council by a ratio of twenty votes to one, and is declared the rightful heir. On the old king's death two years later, Viserys succeeds him on the Iron Throne. Rhaenys's husband, however, is the powerful lord Corlys Velaryon, and this estranges the Velaryons from the royal court. King Viserys, married to Aemma of House Arryn, names their daughter Rhaenyra as his successor, ahead of his hot-tempered and mercurial younger brother Daemon (the titular \\"rogue prince\\"). This decision contradicts the new inheritance law established at the Great Council, which should put a male heir ahead of any female one, but Daemon's reputation is so scandalous that Viserys's powerful advisor Otto Hightower eagerly goes along with it. Queen Aemma, however, later dies in childbirth, to a son that lives only a day. Viserys later re-marries to Alicent Hightower, Otto's daughter, and they succeed in producing a male heir, Aegon; but Viserys never rescinds his choice of Rhaenyra to succeed him. The king and queen subsequently have a daughter (Helaena) and two more sons (Aemond and Daeron). As the years pass, a rivalry develops between Rhaenyra and her stepmother Alicent‚Äîand two rival court factions develop around each of them. At a major tournament, Rhaenyra appears wearing a distinctive Targaryen-black dress, while Alicent wears one of the green dresses she favors. The two rival factions start copying this clothing style, with Rhaenyra's followers wearing black, and the Alicent/Aegon camp wearing green‚Äîleading to the two groups being dubbed \\"the Blacks and the Greens\\". Meanwhile, the Velaryons remain as a third major faction, but excluded from power at the royal court. Due to his adventures in the far east, Corlys Velaryon is still one of the wealthiest men in Westeros‚Äîand eventually, the isolated Daemon gravitates to the Velaryon camp as well, by marrying Corlys and Rhaenys's daughter Laena (producing two daughters, Baela and Rhaena). Together, Daemon and Corlys launch a proxy war in the Stepstones island chain, raising an army of mercenaries to carve out territory from pirate enclaves‚Äîaided by the large Velaryon fleet, and Daemon's dragon Caraxes, who soon earns a reputation as \\"the Blood Wyrm\\", battle-hardened from all the blood he has spilled. Daemon is briefly crowned as the new king of the Stepstones (mostly ruling over pirates), but this makes other regional powers grow wary. After defeating Volantis to the east, the other southern Free Cities‚ÄîLys, Myr, and Tyrosh‚Äîset aside their differences to unite as a triple- alliance with a shared government (inaccurately called \\"the Kingdom of the Three Daughters\\" of Valyria‚Äîor \\"the Triarchy\\", even though it is neither a kingdom nor a triarchy). The Triarchy at the eastern end of the island chain allies with independent Dorne at the western end of the Stepstones, and in subsequent years they apply more and more pressure on Daemon's mini-kingdom until he tires of the conflict and withdraws back to King's Landing. Meanwhile, the willful young Rhaenyra is infatuated with Ser Criston Cole of the kingsguard, but through unclear circumstances is later rumored to be in a relationship with Ser Harwin Strong. Pressured by her father, Rhaenyra eventually submits to an arranged marriage with her cousin Laenor Velaryon (son of Corlys, brother of Laena). Their marriage is unhappy, as Laenor is infamously an effete and foppish homosexual (Daemon is lustfully bisexual, but also a fierce warrior). Rhaenyra gives birth to three sons, but none of them have classic Targaryen features of white-blonde hair and purple eyes‚Äîwhich could be due to Rhaenyra's Arryn mother, but combined with widespread rumors of Laenor's sexuality, leads the Greens to whisper persistent rumors that they are really bastards fathered by Harwin Strong. Animosity between Rhaenyra and Alicent also puts their children at odds with one another. In rapid succession, Laenor dies in a suspicious quarrel, and Laena dies after a stillbirth. At Laena's funeral, Rhaenyra's sons brawl with Alicent's son Aemond when he tries to claim Laena's dragon Vhagar: as the older Aemond begins to overpower them, one pulls out a knife, ending up in Aemond losing one eye, but succeeding in claiming Vhagar‚Äîthe greatest living dragon. Not long after, the realm is shocked to learn that Rhaenyra and her uncle Daemon married each other, without asking Viserys's leave. This unites the estranged Velaryons with Rhaenyra's faction of Blacks, and they become one of her biggest supporters against the Greens. They have two sons ‚Äî another Aegon and Viserys. Alicent's son Aegon also marries his sister Helaena, and they produce three young children: twins Jaehaerys and Jaehaera, and baby Maelor. The Hightowers, meanwhile, remain the biggest supporters of Alicent's Aegon, and her father Otto becomes Hand of the King for many years. The Hightowers increasingly whisper that according to the Great Council at the death of Jaehaerys I, a male heir should come ahead of a female one, and thus Aegon should inherit throne ahead of Rhaenyra‚Äîeven though Otto himself once ignored that precedent of the council, when he wanted young Rhaenyra to be heir ahead of her uncle Daemon (a hypocrisy not lost on the Blacks). Rhaenyra's followers also counter that had the Great Council followed standard inheritance, Aemon‚Äôs daughter Rhaenys should still have inherited ahead of Baelon's son Viserys, in which cause Rhaenyra's sons with Laenor would rank ahead of Aegon anyway (which only encourages the Greens to double-down on the accusation that they are really bastards). The subsequent death of King Viserys‚Äîin his bed, from old age and poor health‚Äîsets the stage for The Princess and the Queen, and the outbreak of the Dance of the Dragons. Development The story was to be included in the companion book The World of Ice & Fire but was removed because the book was becoming too long for the original concept of a fully illustrated book. It and several other stories appeared in abridged versions in other anthologies.

Built in 1908-09, it is one of the small community's most architecturally distinctive buildings, designed in the Romanesque Revival style by a local architect. It is named for Daniel Caswell, a generous benefactor to the library, and housed the local public library until 2004. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The building is presently vacant. Description and history The former Caswell Public Library stands on the north side of Main Street (Maine State Routes 35 and 117), in the village center of Harrison, at the northern end of Long Lake. It is a single-story stone structure, built out of uncoursed granite cobbles mortared in place. The building is basically rectangular, with a hip roof. A semicircular section projects from the southern part of the eastern facade, its semi-conical roofline joining that of the main roof. A round turret projects from the southwestern corner of the building, topped by a conical roof. The entrance is set recessed in a projecting vestibule that features a segmented-arch opening and corner pillars that rise above the projection's roof, giving a crenellated effect. The interior is arranged similarly to other 19th-century libraries, with a central circulation desk, a reading room in the semicircular section, and the stack area to the rear. The basement houses offices and a small meeting area and kitchen space. Daniel Caswell's house in Austin, Texas The Harrison Public Library Association (renamed the Caswell Public Library Association in 1947) was established in 1906, its initial collection based on the content of two private circulating collections in the town. The building that housed its collection was destroyed by fire in 1907, although the collection was saved. Daniel Caswell, a Harrison native living in Texas, donated $1,000 to a building fund, conditioned on it being named for him. The present building was constructed in 1908 on land previously occupied by a church which had burned down. The architect was John Proctor, a Harrison resident whose only known works are in the immediate area; it is his only known library commission. There is a distinct stylistic resemblance between the library and Caswell's house in Austin, Texas, suggesting the benefactor may have had an influence on the design. The building housed the library until 2004, when space concerns prompted its move to larger quarters. The building presently stands vacant.

It takes its name from the town of Rinaldone, near Montefiascone in the province of Viterbo, northern Lazio. Story The Rinaldone culture developed between 3700 and 2100 BC in the centre of the Italian peninsula. It therefore covers most of the Chalcolithic, referred to here as Eneolithic. It was defined in 1939 by Italian archeologist Pia Laviosa Zambotti based,Negroni Catacchio N., 2006, La cultura di Rinaldone, Negroni Catacchio N.

Typical objects of this culture are the flask-shaped jars, decorative elements such as antimony necklace, bone beads, steatite pendants and a considerable number of weapons including mallet heads, arrowheads, spears and daggers. One of the most famous funerary contexts belonging to this culture is the so-called \\"widow's tomb\\" discovered in 1951 in Ponte San Pietro, near Ischia di Castro. It contains the remains of a 30-year-old man of high rank, with a rich collection of pottery and weapons, and a young woman with a much more modest outfit, who was probably sacrificed to be buried with her husband.Jean Guilaine,Jean Zammit - The Origins of War: Violence in Prehistory p.162-164  Chronology, development area and influences  Rinaldone material culture objects = Chronology = Until the 1990s, there was almost no clear carbon-14 dating attributable to this culture.Cazzella A., 1994, Dating the \\"Copper Age\\" in Italy and adjacent islands, Journal of European Archaeology, vol. 2, p. 1-19 The situation has since evolved, in particular thanks to the numerous dates carried out on the burials of the Selvicciola necropolis in the north of Lazio.Conti A.

There are strong similarities between the latter and the metallurgical practices attested to at Cabri√®res in H√©rault.Sangmeister E., 2005, Les d√©buts de la m√©tallurgie dans le sud-ouest de l‚ÄôEurope : l‚Äôapport de l‚Äô√©tude des analyses m√©tallographiques, in Ambert P., Vaquer J. (Dir), La premi√®re m√©tallurgie en France et dans les pays limitrophes, Soci√©t√© Pr√©historique Fran√ßaise, M√©moire XXXVII, Paris, p. 19-25 However, this hypothesis is discussed due to the lack of data on possible relays between central Italy and southern France.Dolfini A., 2013, The Emergence of Metallurgy in the Central Mediterranean Region: A New Model, European Journal of Archaeology, vol. 16 n. 1, p. 21-62 On the other hand, Rinaldone's culture is not impervious to external influences. There is even a facies derived from this culture in Tuscany that bears the name of the cave in which it was identified, the facies of Sassi Neri.Negroni Catacchio N., 2006, La lunga storia dell‚ÄôEtruria prima degli Etruschi, in Negroni Catacchio N., Pastori e guerrieri nell‚ÄôEtruria del IV e III millennio a.C., La civilt√† di Rinaldone a 100 anni delle prime scoperte, Atti del Settimo Incontro di Studi Preistoria e Protostoria in Etruria, Viterbo, 21 novembre 2003 - Valentano (Vt) ‚Äì Pittigliano (Gr), 17-18 Settembre 2004, Centro Studi di Preistoria e Archeologia, Milano, vol. I, p. 3-29 In the eponymous site but also in neighbouring sites such as the Fontino cave near Grosseto and the San Giuseppe cave in Elba Island, the objects, especially the vases, have characteristics that bring them closer to the cultures of Rinaldone, Gaudo Culture and Laterza Culture.Grifoni Cremonesi R., 2009, Quelques observations √† propos de l‚Äô√Çge du cuivre en Italie centrale, in De M√©diterran√©e et d‚Äôailleurs... M√©langes offerts √† Jean Guilaine, Archives d‚Äô√âcologie Pr√©historique, Toulouse, p. 323-332 Relationships between Rinaldone's and Gaudo's culture are also visible in the Rome region. In a tomb in Tenuta della Selcetta 2 vases of both cultures are associated. Similarly, in Osteria del Curato-Via Cinquefrondi, in a necropolis Laterza Culture-Ortucchio Culture, a female tomb containing Rinaldone, Laterza and Gaudo ceramics has been exhumed. In addition, the structure of the tombs, the funeral ritual and the presence in both cases of long arrowheads bring the cultures of Rinaldone and Gaudo closer together.Salerno A., 1998, Inquadramento cronologico e culturale, in Bailo Modesti G., Salerno A., Pontecagnano II, 5.

It is of historic significance because it gave U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson authorization, without a formal declaration of war by Congress, for the use of conventional military force in Southeast Asia. Specifically, the resolution authorized the President to do whatever necessary in order to assist \\"any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty\\". This included involving armed forces. It was opposed in the Senate only by Senators Wayne Morse (D-OR) and Ernest Gruening (D-AK). Senator Gruening objected to \\"sending our American boys into combat in a war in which we have no business, which is not our war, into which we have been misguidedly drawn, which is steadily being escalated\\". The Johnson administration subsequently relied upon the resolution to begin its rapid escalation of U.S. military involvement in South Vietnam and open warfare between North Vietnam and the United States. Towards the Incident  Throughout 1963, the Kennedy administration was concerned that the South Vietnamese regime of Ngo Dinh Diem was losing the war to the Viet Cong. Such concerns were intensified after Diem was overthrown and killed in a CIA- sponsored coup on 2 November 1963. On 19 December 1963, the Defense Secretary Robert McNamara visited Saigon and reported to President Lyndon B. Johnson that the situation was \\"very disturbing\\" as \\"current trends, unless reversed in the next two or three months, will lead to neutralization at best or more likely to a Communist-controlled state\\". McNamara further reported the Viet Cong were winning the war as they controlled \\"larger percentages of the population, greater amounts of territory and have destroyed or occupied more strategic hamlets than expected\\". About the Revolutionary Command Council as the South Vietnamese military junta called itself, McNamara was scathing, saying \\"there is no organized government in South Vietnam\\" as the junta was \\"indecisive and drifting\\" with the generals being \\"so preoccupied with essentially political affairs\\" that they had no time for the war. In response to McNamara's report, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended the United States intervene in the war, with the Air Force's commander, General Curtis LeMay, calling for a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam, saying \\"we are swatting flies when we should be going after the manure pile\\". Using less earthly language than LeMay, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Maxwell D. Taylor in a report to Johnson called South Vietnam \\"pivotal\\" to the United States's \\"worldwide confrontation with Communism\\" and predicated that to allow South Vietnam to fall to the Viet Cong would be such a blow to American \\"durability, resolution and trustworthiness\\" that all of Asia might very well be lost to Communism. Taylor also argued that to see South Vietnam fall to the Viet Cong would so damage \\"our image\\" in Africa and Latin America that both of those regions might also be lost to Communism as well. Given these stakes with Taylor claiming the entire Third World would be lost to Communism if South Vietnam went Communist, he argued for drastic measures, saying the United States should taking \\"increasing bolder\\" measures with the United States to start bombing North Vietnam.The journalist Stanley Karnow wrote Taylor had offered up an \\"inflated\\" version of the \\"domino theory\\" with the entire Third World potentially lost to Communism if South Vietnam became the first \\"domino\\" to fall. Though Johnson was planning as president to focus on domestic affairs such as civil rights for Afro-Americans together with social legislation to improve the lot of the poor, he was very afraid that to \\"lose\\" South Vietnam would cause him to be branded as \\"soft on Communism\\", the dreaded accusation that could end the career of any American politician at the time. Rather than the primat der aussenpolitik reason of the \\"domino theory\\", Johnson was more motivated by the primat der innenpolitik reason of the fear that if South Vietnam was \\"lost\\", it would generate a right-wing backlash similar to the one generated by the \\"loss of China\\" in 1949, which allowed Senator Joseph McCarthy to achieve national prominence. The fear that a new McCarthy-type Republican politician would emerge and derail his domestic reforms was Johnson's primary reason for refusing to accept the possibility of South Vietnam being \\"lost\\". Johnson's determination to not \\"lose\\" South Vietnam extended to rejecting a peace plan put forward by the French President Charles de Gaulle who favored having South Vietnam becoming neutral in the Cold War in order to provide Americans with an honorable way to disengage from Vietnam. Though not keen on fighting a war in Vietnam, Johnson told Taylor and other the chiefs of staff at a Christmas Eve party in 1963: \\"Just let me get elected, and then you can have your war\\". The instability of South Vietnamese politics suggested it was impossible for the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam-i.e. the South Vietnamese Army) to focus on the war. Johnson stated at a meeting in the Oval Office that he was fed up with \\"this coup shit\\", and shortly thereafter another coup took place in Saigon as General Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh overthrew General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh on 30 January 1964. Through the United States had long denounced the government of North Vietnam for trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam, accusing Hanoi of \\"aggression\\", the government of South Vietnam had with American support also been trying to overthrow the government of North Vietnam. Ever since the Geneva Accords had partitioned Vietnam in 1954, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been training squads of South Vietnamese volunteers and infiltrating them into North Vietnam with the aim of starting an anti-Communist guerrilla war with a spectacular lack of success. For an example, of the 80 teams that were infiltrated into North Vietnam in 1963, all of were captured, causing one CIA agent to later say: \\"I didn't mind butchering the enemy, but we were butchering our own allies\\". In January 1964, Johnson gave his approval for a plan to step up the pace and intensity of the covert war against North Vietnam, which was code-named Operation 34A. Johnson had hopes that Operation 34A might at best lead to the overthrow of North Vietnam's Communist government and at worse might so weaken North Vietnam as to end the war in South Vietnam. As part of Operation 34A, starting on 1 February 1964, South Vietnamese commandos began to conduct maritime raids on coastal North Vietnam under American naval operational command. The new Kh√°nh government proved to be just as ineffective as the previous Minh government had been in fighting the war. In February 1964, Lyman Kirkpatrick, the CIA's Inspector General, visited South Vietnam and reported that he was \\"shocked by the number of our people and of the military, even those whose job is always to say that we are winning, who feel the tide is against us\\". The general consensus among American Vietnam experts by early 1964 was as one official wrote \\"unless there is a marked improvement in the effectiveness of the South Vietnamese government and armed forces\\" that South Vietnam had only \\"an even chance of withstanding the insurgency menace during the next few weeks or months\\". Publicly the Johnson administration still ruled out American intervention, but in private Johnson was inclined to listen to the advice of McNamara and Taylor who advised him that only American military intervention could save South Vietnam now as the feuding generals of the Revolutionary Command Council was simply too disunited, too corrupt and too incompetent to win the war. Drafting In February 1964, Walt Whitman Rostow, the director of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff pointed out a major constitutional problem with the plans to commit American forces to Vietnam, noting under the American constitution only Congress had the power to declare war. Johnson had made it clear that he was opposed to Kh√°nh's plans to have South Vietnam invade North Vietnam out of the fear of causing a war with China, and he had even less enthusiasm for the United States invading North Vietnam. To have the U.S. declare war on North Vietnam would lead to immense domestic pressure to invade North Vietnam. Johnson remembered how in 1950 the approach of U.S. forces upon the Yalu led to Chinese intervention in the Korean War, and was fearful that invading North Vietnam would again led to Chinese intervention. Moreover, unlike in 1950, by 1964 China had nuclear weapons. To resolve this problem, Rostow suggested to Johnson that Congress pass a resolution authorizing Johnson to use force in Vietnam. Rostow was supported by William Bundy, the assistant secretary for Asia, who advised Johnson in a memo on 1 March 1964 that the U.S Navy should blockade Haiphong and start bombing North Vietnam's railroads, factories, road and training camps. Bundy stated that the plans for stepped-up U.S involvement would \\"normally require\\" a declaration of war from Congress. Bundy advised against the \\"blunt instrument\\" of a declaration of war as at present Johnson still only had only \\"selective goals\\" in Vietnam, but stated that it would be \\"unsatisfactory\\" to have Congress not endorse the planned increased involvement in Vietnam for constitutional reasons. Bundy argued that the \\"best answer\\" to this problem was an event from Johnson's own career as a Senator when in January 1955 when he voted for the Formosa Resolution giving President Eisenhower the power to use military force \\"as he deems necessary\\" to protect Taiwan from a Chinese invasion. At the time, the Taiwan Strait Crisis was raging with the Chinese Communists bombarding several islands in the Taiwan strait still held by the Kuomintang regime in Taiwan, and many believed the congressional resolution giving Eisenhower the legal power to go to war in defense of Taiwan had ended the crisis. Unlike the 1955 resolution, which Johnson had supported as Senate Majority Leader and used all of his influence to get the other Senators to vote for, the current Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield, was known to be skeptical about using American forces to support South Vietnam. Mansfield, a devout Catholic who was only willing to support wars that met the Catholic definition of a \\"just war\\" had once been one of South Vietnam's warmest supporters on Capital Hill, but after visiting South Vietnam in late 1962 came back very disillusioned by what he had seen, stating the regime was just as tyrannical as the Viet Cong guerrillas fighting to overthrow it. In addition to Mansfield, Bundy predicted problems from Senator Wayne Morse, a stubborn and cantankerous character who was known for his strongly held view that only Congress had power to declare war, and who deeply disliked resolutions like the Formosa resolution as weakening the power of Congress. Bundy warned the president that his \\"doubtful friends\\" in Congress might delay the passage of the desired resolution which would give America's European allies opposed to a war in Southeast Asia the chance to impose \\"tremendous pressure\\" on the U.S. \\"to stop and negotiate\\". McNamara visited South Vietnam for four days starting on 8 March 1964, and upon his return to Washington was even more pessimistic than he been before in December 1963. McNamara reported to Johnson the situation had \\"unquestionably been growing worse\\" since his last visit in December as 40% of the countryside was now under Vietcong \\"control or predominant influence\\". McNamara further reported that desertion rate in the ARVN was \\"high and increasing\\"; the Vietcong were \\"recruiting energetically\\"; the South Vietnamese people were overcome by \\"apathy and indifference\\"; and the \\"greatest weakness\\" was the \\"uncertain viability\\" of Kh√°nh regime which might be overthrown by another coup at any moment. In response to McNamara's report, the National Security Council issued an \\"action memorandum\\" calling for increased military aid to South Vietnam and asserted that Vietnam was a \\"test case\\" of American global leadership, claiming that a Communist victory in South Vietnam would so damage American prestige that none of America's allies would believe in American promises if South Vietnam was \\"lost\\". By presenting the Vietnam war in these stark terms with the melodramatic claim that the United States would cease to be a world power if South Vietnam was \\"lost\\", the \\"action memorandum\\" virtually guaranteed American intervention.. At the time, Morse was one of the few critics of Johnson's Vietnam policy. In a speech in April 1964, Morse called the war \\"McNamara's War\\", claiming: \\"Not one voice has yet answered my contention that the United States, under the leadership of Defense Secretary McNamara, is fighting an illegal and unwise war in Vietnam.\\" Morse remained outspoken in his criticism of Johnson's Vietnam policy, accusing him of violating international law. On 13 May 1964, Bundy called a meeting to discuss how best to deal with Morse. Jonathan Moore, an aide to Bundy advised him that Morse was correct that the administration was \\"on pretty thin ice\\" when it came to advocating escalation on the basis of international law. As it was felt that Morse was strong on the legalistic arguments, Moore recommended that the administration \\"shift gears rapidly into a general (practical and political) rationale\\" and ignore Morse as much as possible. Bundy believed the resolution would give Johnson \\"the full support of the school of thought headed by Senator Mansfield and Senator Aiken and leave ourselves with die- hard opposition only from Senator Morse and his very few cohorts.\\" On 27 May 1964, Johnson invited his mentor, Senator Richard Russell Jr. to the Oval Office for a discussion about Vietnam that unknown to the latter he recorded. Russell predicted that American involvement in Vietnam would lead to a war with China, saying he \\"it's the damned worse mess I ever saw\\" and South Vietnam was \\"not important a damned bit\\". Johnson stated that his experts believed that China would not enter the war, but commented the experts had said the same thing in 1950. Johnson noted that according to most polls 63% of Americans did not know or care about Vietnam; those who did were making an issue of the 35 American advisers killed fighting in Vietnam so far in 1964. Russell noted that more Americans were killed in car accidents in Atlanta than had been killed in Vietnam but warned the public opinion could change if more Americans were killed. Russell dismissed the American ambassador to South Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., as too arrogant, saying \\"He's thinks he's dealing with barbarian tribes out there. And he's the emperor and he's just going to tell them what to do. There's no doubt in my mind that he had ol'Diem killed out there\\". Johnson called the coup that saw the Ngo brothers killed \\"a tragic mistake\\", which he blamed on Lodge. Russell suggested making Lodge into the \\"fall guy\\" for the failures of South Vietnam and urged Johnson to sent an expert who was \\"not scared to death of McNamara\\" to go to South Vietnam to recommend a withdraw, saying preferably the expert should be a war hero from World War Two, suggesting Omar Bradley or Lucius D. Clay as possible candidates. Johnson was intrigued by Russell's suggestion, but then changed the subject by calling Mansfield a \\"Milquetoast with no spine\\", saying contemptuously of Manfield's plans for an international conference to settle the Vietnam war: \\"Conferences aint' going to do a damn bit of good\\". Russell warned Johnson against relying too much on McNamara, saying: \\"McNamara is the smartest fella any of us know. But he's got so much-he's opinionated as hell- and he's made up his mind\\". Johnson expressed his confidence in McNamara, saying he was the most intelligent man he knew and said he was trying to buy time until the elections were over in November before deciding what to do. However, he complained: \\"But those politicians got to raising hell, and Scripps-Howard writing these stories, and all the Senators, and Nixon, Rockefeller and Goldwater-let's move, let's go in the North\\". After discussing the failure of the bombing campaign against North Korea in the Korean war, both men agreed that North Vietnam would not be defeated by strategic bombing. Johnson concluded: \\"Well, they'd impeach a president that runs out, wouldn't they? Outside of Morse, everybody says you got to go in\\". By late May 1964, a rough draft of the resolution that was to become the Gulf of Tonkin resolution had been completed by Bundy which if passed by Congress would give Johnson the legal power to use force to defend any nation in Southeast Asia threatened by \\"Communist aggression or subversion\\". By the beginning of June 1964, the final draft of the resolution had been completed and all that remained to do was to submit it to Congress. The acting Attorney General, Nicholas Katzenbach, called resolution the \\"functional equivalent of a declaration of war\\". The U.S Air Force had already selected 94 sites in North Vietnam to be bombed while the U.S. Navy had moved a carrier task force into the Gulf of Tonkin with the orders to be prepared for \\"reprisal bombings\\" of North Vietnam. Initially, the plans called for the United States to respond to guerrilla attacks in South Vietnam with bombing raids over North Vietnam, and then Johnson would submit the resolution to Congress sometime in late June 1964. At the time, Congress was preoccupied with the Civil Rights Act, which was intended to outlaw segregation, a bill that Johnson had supported and was met with fierce resistance from Southern senators and congressmen who did everything within their power to \\"kill the bill\\". Johnson wanted the Civil Rights Act passed before submitting the resolution to Congress. On 15 June 1964, the National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, told the National Security Council that the president did not feel that Viet Cong attacks on the South Vietnamese government were a sufficient casus belli as Johnson wanted a North Vietnamese attack on American forces as his casus belli, arguing that Congress would be more likely to pass the resolution if it was in response to the latter rather than the former. On 18 June 1964, the Canadian diplomat J. Blair Seaborn, who served as Canada's representative on the International Control Commission, arrived in Hanoi carrying a secret message from Johnson that North Vietnam would suffer the \\"greatest devastation\\" from American bombing if it continued on its present course. Johnson asked the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, towards the end of June to provide a legal basis for the United States to fight in Vietnam, and he suggested the SEATO treaty would be sufficient. In June 1964, the American ambassador in Saigon, Henry Cabot Lodge, resigned in order to seek the Republican nomination for president. Johnson appointed Taylor as the new ambassador with orders to make the South Vietnamese fight. Taylor's successor as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was General Earle \\"Bus\\" Wheeler. The Gulf of Tonkin Incident Soviet-North Vietnamese relations had badly strained in the early 1960s as North Vietnam moved closer to China, the more militant and aggressive of the two warring Communist giants. When Mao Zedong denounced Nikita Khrushchev for his \\"cowardice\\" for choosing a diplomatic compromise to settle the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 instead of a nuclear war against the United States as Mao preferred, North Vietnamese newspapers approvingly cited his remarks. Likewise, when Khrushchev signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963, Mao again mocked him for his moderation, and was again approvingly quoted by North Vietnamese newspapers. In a bid to recapture influence lost to China, the Soviet Union sold North Vietnam a radar system that was far more advanced than anything China could produce together with batteries of SAMs (surface-to-air missiles). All through the spring and summer of 1964, Soviet workers were building and installing radar stations together with SAM batteries all over North Vietnam while training the North Vietnamese in their use. As the U.S. Air Force and Navy were developing their plans at the same time to bomb North Vietnam, both the admirals and Air Force generals insisted that they needed more information about the radar network the Soviets were installing, most notably the frequencies the radar used in order to develop jamming mechanisms. As a result, the U.S. Navy began to increase DESOTO patrols off the coast of North Vietnam. The Navy's tactic was to have South Vietnamese commandos land to attack the North Vietnamese radar stations, forcing the operators to turn on the radars, which thereby allowed the Americans to learn what frequencies they used. The South Vietnamese commandos were landed in light, Norwegian-built patrol boats made of aluminium and armed with machine guns and cannons known as the Swift boats. By July 1964, the rugged coastline of North Vietnam with its islands, bays, and estuaries was a war zone with South Vietnamese commandos constantly landing to raid while the North Vietnamese made vigorous efforts to stop the raids. In support of the raids, an American destroyer, the USS Maddox was deployed to the Gulf of Tonkin with orders to collect electronic intelligence on the North Vietnamese radar system. Admiral U. S. Grant Sharp Jr., the commander of the Pacific fleet ordered Captain John J. Herrick of the Maddox not to go any closer that 8 miles from the coast of North Vietnam and no more than 4 miles from any of the archipelagos off the coast. The French had claimed control of only 3 miles of the waters off the coastline of Indochina, a claim that North Vietnam had inherited. Subsequently, the North Vietnamese had extended their claim to control of waters 12 miles off their coastline, a claim the United States had declined to recognize. On 30 July 1964, South Vietnamese commandos tried to attack the North Vietnamese radar station on the island of Hon Me, but were detected as they were coming in, leading the North Vietnamese to open fire, making any landing impossible. The radar on Hon Me was turned on, and the Maddox stationed off the coast picked up the radar frequency being used. North Vietnam made a formal protest about the raid to the International Control Commission consisting of delegations of diplomats from India, Canada and Poland that were supposed to enforce the Geneva Accords, accusing the United States of being behind the raid. President Johnson as he signs the resolution on August 10, 1964 275px The , a U.S. destroyer, was conducting a DESOTO patrol in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin on August 2, 1964, when it reported being attacked by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats from the 135th Torpedo Squadron, which were attempting to close their range on Maddox for effective torpedo fire (1,000 yards was maximum effective range for the torpedoes) Maddox fired over 280 5-inch shells and the boats expended their 6 torpedoes (all misses) and some 14.5-mm machinegun fire. Breaking contact, the combatants commenced going their separate ways, when the three torpedo boats, T-333, T-336, and T-339 were then attacked by four USN F-8 Crusader jet fighter bombers from the aircraft carrier . The Crusaders reported no hits with their Zuni rockets, but scored hits on all three torpedo boats with their 20-mm cannons, damaging all three boats. Johnson was informed of the incident and in the first use of the \\"hotline\\" to Moscow installed after the Cuban Missile Crisis called Khrushchev in the Kremlin to say that the United States did not want war, but he hoped that the Soviets would use their influence to persuade North Vietnam to not attack American warships. Through Johnson had now an \\"incident\\" at sea involving a North Vietnamese attack against American warships, he declined to use it as a reason to present a resolution to Congress. Johnson's fear was that the North Vietnamese could claim that the attempted raid on the radar station on Hon Me on 30 July gave them legitimate fears that the Maddox might have been moving in for a new attack. Johnson wanted an \\"incident\\" where it was unambiguous that the North Vietnamese were the aggressors by attacking American warships in waters that the American regarded as international. Out of the hope of provoking such an incident, Johnson ordered the Maddox to continue to cruise off the coast of North Vietnam, to be joined by another destroyer, USS Turner Joy with orders \\"to attack any force that attacks them\\". Both destroyers were ordered to sail 8 miles from North Vietnam in waters that Americans asserted were international waters, disregarding North Vietnam's claim to the 12-mile limit. The Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, ordered his staff to \\"pull together\\" the resolution Bundy had written in May-June, just in case Johnson decided to submit it to Congress. On 3 August 1963, the South Vietnamese in their Swift boats raided Cape Vinhson and Cua Ron. The cruise of the American destroyers was not directly connected to the raid, but Herrick knew from reading the summaries of decrypted North Vietnamese radio messages that the North Vietnamese believed that it was. Herrick received orders to \\"show the gauntlet\\" and prove to the North Vietnamese that the Americans would sail off North Vietnam in waters that the Americans insisted were international waters. Two days later on a very stormy night on August 4, Maddox and the destroyer Turner Joy both reported to be under attack again, by North Vietnamese torpedo boats; during this alleged engagement, Turner Joy fired approximately 220 3-inch & 5-inch shells at surface targets showing on the radar. In response to the reported attack, aircraft from the Ticonderoga were launched, but the pilots reported no visual contact with any craft other than the two destroyers. Hanoi subsequently insisted that it had not launched a second attack. Through Herrick had reported an attack by North Vietnamese torpedo boats, he soon developed strong doubts about whatever an attack had actually occurred. Herrick reported to Admiral Sharp that the \\"torpedo boats\\" were almost certainly radar blips due to the \\"freak weather effects\\" caused by the storm and that an \\"overeager\\" sonar operator aboard the Maddox had mistaken the effects of the storm for torpedoes. Herrick's report concluded with the statement the \\"entire action leaves many doubts\\" as he noted that no sailor abroad his ship had seen a torpedo boat nor had heard any gunfire beyond the guns of the Turner Joy. Likewise no sailor abroad the Turner Joy claimed to have seen any North Vietnamese craft and none of the pilots of the Crusader aircraft stated that they had seen any torpedo boats. A later investigation by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee revealed that Maddox had been on an electronic intelligence (DESOTO) mission. It also learned that the U.S. Naval Communication Center in the Philippine Islands, in reviewing the ships' messages, had questioned whether any second attack had actually occurred. In 2005, an internal National Security Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded that Maddox had engaged the North Vietnamese Navy on August 2, but that there may not have been any North Vietnamese Naval vessels present during the engagement of August 4. The report stated: In 1965, President Johnson commented privately: \\"For all I know, our Navy was shooting at whales out there.\\" Congress votes Early on the morning of 4 August 1964, Johnson told several congressmen at a meeting that North Vietnam had just attacked an American patrol in the Gulf of Tonkin in international waters and promised retaliation. At the same time, Johnson also stated that he wanted Congress to vote for a resolution of support. After the meeting, Johnson told one of his aides, Kenny O'Donnell, that he felt he was \\"being tested\\" by North Vietnam with both agreeing that how the president handled the crisis would affect the election. O'Donnell recalled that Johnson's main fear was the incident might allow his Republican opponent in the election, Senator Barry Goldwater, a chance to gain in the polls. O'Donnell added that Johnson felt that he \\"must not allow them [the Republicans] to accuse him of vacillating or being an indecisive leader\\". The equivocal nature of Captain Herrick's reports were a worrisome factor, and Johnson informed McNamara, the member of the cabinet that he trusted the most, to ensure that the naval report remove all of the ambiguous elements. In turn, McNamara phoned Admiral Sharp to say the president was keen to launch a retaliatory raid, but could not move \\"unless we are dammed sure what happened\\". Admiral Sharp in turn applied strong pressure on Herrick to rewrite his report to \\"confirm absolutely\\" that his patrol had been just attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats. Admiral Sharp in a telephone call at 2:08 pm to the Air Force general David A. Burchinal stated he had no doubt that the second attack had occurred, and expressed his annoyance at Herrick for his doubts. Just forty minutes later, Herrick sent a message on the radio saying \\"Certain that the original ambush was bona fide\\". At the same time that Sharp was pressuring Herrick, Johnson had summoned McNamara to the White House to point out to him the best places to bomb in North Vietnam. The British ambassador, Lord Harlech, and the West German ambassador, Karl Heinrich Knappstein, were summoned to the State Department to be told that the United States would be launching a major bombing raid on North Vietnam very soon. A press release from the Defense Department accused North Vietnam of a \\"second deliberate attack\\" on American warships in international waters. At a meeting of the National Security Council, Rusk pressed for a bombing raid, saying the second alleged attack was more serious of the two incidents and that it indicated that North Vietnam wanted war with the United States. The CIA director John A. McCone in response stated that his agency believed that North Vietnam did not want war with America, saying the North Vietnam was acting \\"out of pride\\" and anger over the violation of its sovereignty with American warships sailing through its waters and South Vietnamese commandos attacking its shore. However, McCone accused North Vietnam of \\"upping the ante\\" and stated he supported the idea of bombing raids. Carl Rowan of the U.S. Information Agency and the lone black man at the meeting said his agency would have to justify any bombing raid and to rebut charges that the United State had fabricated the incidents, leading McNamara to say that there was no doubt that both incidents had occurred. McNamara wanted another DeSoto patrol off North Vietnam, but the undersecretary of state, George Ball, made an impassioned speech, saying: \\"Mr. President, I urge you not to make that decision. Suppose one of the destroyers is sunk with several hundred men abroad. Inevitably, there'll be a Congressional investigation. What would your defense be?...Just think what Congress and the would press would do with that! They would say that Johnson had thrown away lives just to have an excuse to bomb the North. Mr. President you couldn't live with that.\\" In response, Johnson told McNamara: \\"We won't go ahead with it, Bob. Let's put it on the shelf\\". The National Security Agency (NSA) had broken North Vietnam's codes, and McNamara put much emphasis to Johnson on certain decrypts speaking of North Vietnamese torpedo boats having been damaged by American destroyers as proving the second incident happened. However, several intelligence analysis at the time accused McNamara of having either have misinterpreted, either intentionally or by mistake, decrypts referring to the first incident of 2 August and presenting them as referring to the second alleged incident of 4 August. Ray S. Cline, the deputy director of the CIA later stated: \\"I felt from the start that the second incident had been questionable, but I simply wasn't sure. However, after a number of days collating and examining the reports relating to the second incident, I concluded that they were either unsound or that they dealt with the first incident\\". Cline was told to keep his doubts to himself. Johnson invited 18 Senators and congressmen led by Mansfield to the White House to inform them he had ordered a bombing raid on North Vietnam and asked for their support for a resolution. Johnson began the meeting with a warning: \\"It is dangerous to have the leaders come here. The reporters see they are coming and they go back and report all over the Hill. Some of our boys are floating in the water. The facts we would like to present to you are to be held in the closest confidence and are to be kept in this room until announced\\". Congressman Charles A. Halleck denied leaking the meeting, saying \\"I did not tell a damn person\\". The atmosphere of the meeting with Johnson saying that the American warplanes were on their way to bomb North Vietnam made it difficult for those present to oppose the president, out of the fear of appearing unpatriotic. Most of the congressional leaders were supportive, through Mansfield still had doubts, saying he preferred the matter be referred to the United Nations. Rusk assured Mansfield that he would liked to take the matter up at the UN, but the possibility of a Soviet veto at the UN left the president no choice. Johnson told Mansfield the UN was not an option and that: \\"I have told you what I want from you\\". Senator George Aiken told the president about the proposed resolution: \\"By the time you send it up, there won't be anything for us to do, but support you\\". Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper argued that there was no point in inquiring if the second incident had occurred or not, saying it was imperative that the United States must strike North Vietnam at once to show strength. Rusk told the congressional leaders: \\"We are trying to get across two points-one, leave your neighbor alone and, two, if you don't we will have to get busy\\". About the fact that Radio Hanoi had admitted to the first incident, but denied the second, Rusk used the radio broadcasts to argue for the malevolence and dishonesty of North Vietnam, saying: \\"They have not talked about what did happen, but what did not happen\\". After the meeting, Johnson summoned his National Security Adviser, McGeorge \\"Mac\\" Bundy, to tell him: \\"You know that resolution your brother's been talking about for the past few months? Well, now's the time to get it through Congress\\". When Bundy replied \\"Mr. President, that seems too fast for me\\", Johnson growled \\"I didn't ask you that question. I want you to do it\\". Within hours, President Johnson ordered the launching of retaliatory air strikes (Operation Pierce Arrow) on the bases of the North Vietnamese torpedo boats and announced, in a television address to the American public that same evening, that U.S. naval forces had been attacked. Johnson in his television address announced: \\"Repeated acts of violence against the armed forces of the United States must be met not only with alert defense, but with positive reply. That reply is being given as I speak tonight\\". Johnson requested approval of a resolution \\"expressing the unity and determination of the United States in supporting freedom and in protecting peace in southeast Asia\\", stating that the resolution should express support \\"for all necessary action to protect our Armed Forces\\", but repeated previous assurances that \\"the United States ... seeks no wider war\\". As the nation entered the final three months of political campaigning for the 1964 elections (in which Johnson was standing for election), the president contended that the resolution would help \\"hostile nations ... understand\\" that the United States was unified in its determination \\"to continue to protect its national interests\\". The media reaction to the raid was highly favorable with The New York Times declaring in an editorial that those doubted if Johnson could handle pressure \\"were saying that they now had a commander-in-chief who was better under pressure than they had ever seen him\\". A rare dissenting voice was the veteran left-wing journalist I.F. Stone who argued that the raid was illegal stating the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellog-Briand Pact and the United Nations Charter had banned reprisals in peacetime. Stone wrote in an editorial: \\"Hackworth's Digest, the State Department's huge Talmud of international law, quotes an old War Department manual, Rules of Land Warfare, as authoritative on the subject. This says reprisals are never to be taken 'merely for revenge', but only as an unavoidable last resort 'to enforce the rules of civilized warfare'. And they should not exceed the degree of violence committed by the enemy\\". Stone argued that no damage had been done to either destroyer, but contrast the American bombing raid had destroyed a naval base and an oil storage facility in North Vietnam. On 5 August 1964, Johnson submitted the resolution to Congress, which if passed would give him the legal power to \\"take all necessary measures\\" and \\"prevent further aggression\\" as well as allowing him to decide when \\"peace and security\\" in Southeast Asia were attained. Johnson commented the resolution was \\"like grandma's nightshirt-it covered everything\\". Despite his public claims of \\"aggression\\", Johnson in private believed that the second incident had not taken place, saying at a meeting in the Oval Office in his Texas twang: \\"Hell, those dumb stupid sailors were just shooting at flying fish\\". The president's two chosen instruments for passing the resolution were the Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and Senator J. William Fulbright, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. McNamara had the image of the \\"whiz kid\\", a man of almost superhuman intelligence and ability whose computer-generated graphs and spreadsheets showed the best way to \\"scientifically\\" solve any problem. McNamara, whose statements always seemed to be backed up by the Pentagon's computers had the ability to \\"dazzle\\" Congress and whatever he requested of Congress tended to be approved. Fulbright, through too much an individualist and an intellectual to fit into the Senate's \\"Club\\", was widely respected as the Senate's resident foreign policy expert and as a defender of Congress's prerogatives. If Fulbright backed the resolution, Johnson knew that he would probably carry over the doubters and waverers, of which there were several. Johnson knew that the conservative Republicans together with the conservative Southern Democrats would vote for the resolution, but he did not want to be dependent upon their support for his foreign policy as his domestic policies were anathema to them. From Johnson's viewpoint, having liberal Democrats and liberal Republicans vote for the resolution would free his hands to carry out the domestic reforms he wanted to have Congress pass after the election. On 5 August 1964, Fulbright arrived at the White House to meet Johnson, where the president asked his old friend to use all his influence to get the resolution passed. Johnson insisted quite vehemently to Fulbright that the alleged attack on the destroyers had taken place and it was only later that Fulbright became skeptical about whatever the alleged attack had really taken place. Furthermore, Johnson insisted the resolution, which was a \\"functional equivalent to a declaration of war\\" was not intended to be used for going to war in Vietnam. In the 1964 election, the Republicans had nominated Goldwater as their candidate, who ran on a platform accusing Johnson of being \\"soft on Communism\\" and by contrast promised a \\"total victory\\" over Communism. Johnson argued to Fulbright that the resolution was an election year stunt that would prove to the voters that he was really \\"tough on Communism\\" and thus dent the appeal of Goldwater by denying him of his main avenue of attack. Besides for the primat der innenpolitik reason Johnson gave for the resolution, he also gave a primat der aussenpolitik reason, arguing that such a resolution would intimidate North Vietnam into ceasing to try to overthrow the government of South Vietnam, and as such Congress passing a resolution would make American involvement in Vietnam less likely rather than more likely. Fulbright's longstanding friendship with Johnson made it difficult for him to go against the president, who cunningly exploited Fulbright's vulnerability, namely his desire to have greater influence over foreign policy. Johnson gave Fulbright the impression that he would be one of his unofficial advisers on foreign policy and that he was very interested in turning his ideas into policies, provided that he voted for the resolution, which was a test of their friendship. Johnson also hinted that he was thinking about sacking Rusk if he won the 1964 election and would consider nominating Fulbright to be the next Secretary of State. Fulbright had much contempt for whoever happened to be Secretary of State, always believing that he understood foreign policy better than any of them, and had a particular contempt for Rusk, so the offer to be Secretary of State was tempting for him. Fulbright also felt a strong rapport with his fellow Southerner Johnson, the first Southern president since Wilson. Finally, for Fulbright in 1964 it was inconceivable that Johnson would lie to him and he believed the resolution \\"was not going to be used for anything other than the Tonkin Gulf incident itself\\" as Johnson had told him. Johnson told Fulbright he wanted the resolution passed by the widest possible margin to show North Vietnam that Congress was united behind the administration. Despite all of Johnson's efforts, there was little danger of the resolution not being passed. A public opinion poll at the time showed that 85% of Americans felt that Congress should pass the resolution. On August 6, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara testified before a joint session of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees. He stated that Maddox had been \\"carrying out a routine mission of the type we carry out all over the world at all times\\" and denied that it had been in any way involved in South Vietnamese patrol boat raids on the offshore islands of Hon Me and Hon Nieu on the nights of July 30 and July 31. In his testimony, McNamara accused North Vietnam of \\"aggression\\" and of an \\"unprovoked attack\\" on the destroyers. Senator Wayne Morse had been tipped off by a source inside the Pentagon about Operation 34A, and asked McNamara about there was any connection between the activities of the Maddox and Operation 34A, leading to a blunt denial. In response to Morse's question, McNamara answered dismissively: \\"Our navy played absolutely no part in, was not associated with, was not aware of any South Vietnamese actions, if there were any...I say this flatly. This is a fact\\". The administration did not, however, disclose that the island raids, although separate from the mission of Maddox, had been part of a program of clandestine attacks on North Vietnamese installations called Operation Plan 34A. These operations were carried out by U.S.-trained South Vietnamese commandos under the control of a special operations unit of the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam called the Studies and Operations Group. Despite McNamara's statement, Morse appeared before an almost empty Senate later on 6 August 1964 to say: \\"The place to settle the controversy is not on the battlefield but around the conference table\\". Morse was supported only by Senator Ernest Gruening who stated in a speech \\"all Vietnam is not worth the life of a single American boy\\". Senator Richard Russell Jr., who previously had doubts about Vietnam and whose long-standing friendship with Johnson had just been severely tested by the latter's support for the Civil Rights Act, supported the resolution, saying: \\"Our national honor is at stake. We cannot and will not shrink from defending it\\". On 6 August 1964, Fulbright gave a speech on the Senate floor calling for the resolution to be passed as he accused North Vietnam of \\"aggression\\" and praised Johnson for his \\"great restraint...in response to the provocation of a small power\\". He also declared his support for the Johnson administration's \\"noble\\" Vietnam policy, which he called a policy of seeking \\"...to establish viable, independent states in Indochina and elsewhere which will be free and secure from the combination of Communist China and Communist North Vietnam\\". Fulbright concluded that this policy could be accomplished via diplomatic means and echoing Johnson's thesis, argued that it was necessary to pass the resolution as a way to intimidate North Vietnam who would presumably change their policies towards South Vietnam once Congress passed the resolution. Fulbright called the resolution a mechanism \\"calculated to prevent the spread of war\\". At a crucial meeting of several Senators, Fulbright was able to persuade them to support the resolution. Several Senators such as Allen J. Ellender, Jacob Javits, John Sherman Cooper, Daniel Brewster, George McGovern and Gaylord Nelson were very reluctant to vote for a resolution that would be a \\"blank cheque\\" for a war in southeast Asia, and at the meeting Fulbright called to discuss the issue, he argued that passing a resolution would make fighting a war less likely, claiming the whole purpose of the resolution was only intimidation. Nelson wanted to add an amendment forbidding Johnson from sending troops to fight in Vietnam unless Congress gave its approval first, saying he did not like the open-ended nature of the resolution. Fulbright dissuaded him, saying he had the president's word that \\"the last thing we want to do is become involved in a land war in Asia\\". Fulbright argued to Nelson the resolution was \\"harmless\\" while saying that the real purpose of the resolution was \\"to pull the rug out from under Goldwater\\", going on to ask Nelson who did he prefer to win the election, Johnson or Goldwater? From the viewpoint of Nelson, a liberal Democrat known for his support of environmentalism, Johnson was a far more preferable president than Goldwater, the leader of the right-wing of the Republican Party. After fewer than nine hours of committee consideration and floor debate, Congress voted, on August 10, 1964, on a joint resolution authorizing the president \\"to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom\\". The unanimous affirmative vote in the House of Representatives was 416‚Äì0. (However, Republican Congressman Eugene Siler of Kentucky, who was not present but opposed the measure, was \\"paired\\" with another member who favored the resolution‚Äîi.e., his opposition was not counted, but the vote in favor was one less than it would have been.) The Senate conferred its approval by a vote of 88‚Äì2. Some members expressed misgivings about the measure, but in the end, Democratic Senators Wayne Morse of Oregon and Ernest Gruening of Alaska cast the only nay votes. At the time, Senator Morse warned that \\"I believe this resolution to be a historic mistake.\\" Morse also predicated that those who voted for the resolution \\"will live to regret it\\". Much to Johnson's satisfaction, Senator Goldwater voted for the resolution as appropriate, which allowed the president to present himself as just \\"tough on Communism\\" as his opponent. After the resolution was passed, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John W. McCormack called Johnson to congratulate him. The call was recorded and Johnson spent much time denouncing Morse as mentally unstable and untrustworthy while he called Gruening an ingrate, saying \\"He's just no good. I've spent millions on him up in Alaska\\". Rostow was ebullient and stated: \\"The second attack probably hadn't happened, but it was the chance to do what we should have been doing all along\\". As a policy instrument The passage of the resolution alarmed several American allies who preferred that the United States not fight in Vietnam such as Canada. J. Blair Seaborn, the Canadian diplomat who served as Canada's representative to the International Control Commission engaged in secret \\"shuttle diplomacy\\" carrying messages back and forth from Hanoi to Washington in an attempt to stop the escalation of the war. On 13 August 1964, Seaborn arrived in Hanoi to meet the North Vietnamese Premier, Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng. Seaborn told ƒê·ªìng that based on his recent meetings with Johnson that he was seriously using the powers he just gained from the Gulf of Tonkin resolution to go to war, but also stated that Johnson was willing to offer \\"economic and other benefits\\" if only North Vietnam ceased trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam. Seaborn further stated that Johnson had told him that North Vietnam would \\"suffer the consequences\\" if it continued on its \\"present course\\". ƒê·ªìng rejected the offer, saying he would rather see the war engulf \\"the whole of Southeast Asia\\" than to abandon the vision of one Communist Vietnam. Though Johnson now had the power to wage war in Vietnam, he proved reluctant to use it, instead hoping that Ambassador Taylor could somehow pressure the South Vietnamese to fight better. On 11 August 1964, William Bundy wrote a memo on the \\"next course of action\\", under which predicated that unless South Vietnamese \\"morale and momentum\\" could be improved, the regime of General Khanh would collapse. Bundy recommended a programme of gradually increasing escalation to achieve \\"maximum results for minimal risks\\". Bundy argued for August, the United States should do nothing to \\"take onus off the Communist side for escalation\\". Starting in September, the memo advocated more DESOTO patrols, 34A raids, and for the United States to start bombing the part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail running through neutral Laos. In January 1965, Bundy stated the \\"next move upward\\" would begin with a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam. Taylor objected to Bundy's plan, stating if the U.S started bombing North Vietnam, it would trigger a North Vietnamese response that the South Vietnamese would not be able to handle on their own. Taylor, who had become increasingly disillusioned with South Vietnam as Khanh drove him to exasperation with his stupidity wrote: \\"We should not get involved militarily with North Vietnam and possibly with Red China if our base in South Vietnam is insecure and Khanh's army is tied down everywhere by the Vietcong insurgency\\". General Wheeler and the rest of Joint Chiefs of Staff rejected Taylor's advice and advocated an immediate strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam. On 7 September 1964, Johnson called a meeting at the White House attended by McNamara, Rusk, Wheeler, the Bundy brothers and Taylor to discuss what to do. Taylor conceded that there \\"only the emergence of an exceptional leader could improve the situation and there is no George Washington in sight\\". The meeting concluded that the U.S. would react \\"as appropriate\\" against \\"any\\" attacks against American forces. A war game conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September 1963 code-named Sigma I found that the U.S. would have to commit half-million troops to have a chance of victory in Vietnam; its sequel code- named Sigma II in September 1964 reached the same conclusion and found that despite the claims of General LeMay that a strategical bombing campaign would not be decisive, instead stating that the war would only be won on the ground. On 1 November 1964, Viet Cong guerrillas attacked the American air field at the Bien Hoa Air Base, killing 5 American servicemen and destroying 6 B-57 bombers. Wheeler recommended an immediate bombing campaign against North Vietnam, but Johnson demurred, instead creating a \\"working group\\" to consider scenarios for American intervention. The conclusion of the \\"working group\\" chaired by William Bundy when presented in late November resorted to the bureaucratic device of the \\"Goldilocks's Principle\\" by presenting Johnson with two extreme options of either invading North Vietnam or abandoning South Vietnam; in between the two extremes was the third option of gradual escalation, which Bundy knew that Johnson would chose. On 1 December 1964, McNamara, Rusk and \\"Mac\\" Bundy presented Johnson again with the \\"Goldilock's Principle\\" by giving him three options, knowing he would chose the third as invading North Vietnam and abandoning South Vietnam were too extreme for him. Johnson agreed to their advice to launch Operation Barrel Roll to bomb the Lao section of the Ho Chi Minh trail and for more 34A raids. On Christmas Eve 1964, the Viet Cong bombed the Brinks Hotel in Saigon, killing two Americans. Despite almost unanimous advice to bomb North Vietnam, Johnson refused, saying in a cable to Taylor \\"The final responsibility is mine and the stakes are very high indeed\\". Johnson added: \\"I have never felt that this war will be won from the air, and it seems to me that what is much needed and would be more effective is a larger and stronger use of Rangers and Special Forces and Marines, or other appropriate military strength on the ground and on scene..I know that it might involve the acceptance of larger Americans sacrifices but I myself am ready to substantially increase the Americans in Vietnam if it is necessary to provide this kind of fighting force against the Vietcong\\". As Johnson continued to procrastinate, he repeatedly received advice from McNamara, the Bundy brothers, Rusk, and Wheeler that now was the time to use his powers under the resolution. A memo co-written by \\"Mac\\" Bundy and McNamara in January 1965 stated \\"our present policy can lead only to a disastrous defeat\\" with the alternative being either \\"salvage what little can be saved\\" by withdrawing or to commit American forces to war. By contrast, Taylor advised Johnson against committing American troops, stating that having the Americans \\"carry the ball\\" would only encourage South Vietnam's feuding generals to engage in even more in-fighting at the expense of the war effort, thus creating a vicious circle where the Americans would do all the fighting while the ARVN did nothing, leading to a situation where more and more Americans would be needed. After a Viet Cong attack on the American air base at Pleiku in February 1965, Johnson called a meeting at the White House attended by his national security team plus Mansfield and McCormack to announce that \\"I've had enough of this\\" and that he had decided on a bombing campaign. Only Mansfield and the Vice President Hubert Humphrey opposed the plans to bomb North Vietnam. Johnson ordered Operation Flaming Dart on 7 February 1965, a bombing raid on a North Vietnamese Army base, which marked the beginning of a series of increasing intense bombing raids. The British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who was strongly opposed to the United States fighting a war in Asia which would distract American attention from Europe, wrote to Johnson proposing a summit in Washington, where he intended to press Johnson to not use his powers under the resolution to fight war in Vietnam. Johnson phoned Wilson to say the proposed summit was superfluous, maintaining he could not see \\"what was to be gained by flapping around the Atlantic with our coattails out\\", and instead urged Wilson to send British troops to fight in Vietnam. On 22 February 1965, the commander of the U.S. forces in Vietnam, General William Westmoreland, stated that he had no confidence in the ability of the ARVN to protect the American air base at Danang and asked for two Marine battalions to protect it, a request that Johnson approved. On 2 March 1965, Johnson ordered Operation Rolling Thunder, the strategic bombing offensive against North Vietnam that had long been urged upon him. On 8 March 1965, two battalions of Marines landed at Danang to fulfill Westmoreland's request for troops to protect the air base. Fulbright who developed doubts by this point advised Johnson that a \\"massive ground and air war in Southeast Asia\\" would be a \\"disaster\\", but Johnson now had the legal power to wage war as he saw fit and disregarded his warning not send any more troops. The Joint Chiefs of Staff led by Wheeler now recommended further troops to Vietnam and on 1 April 1965 Johnson agreed to send 2 more Marine battalions plus 28, 000 logistic troops. At the same time, Johnson approved Westmoreland's request for \\"offensive defense\\" by allowing the Marines to patrol the countryside instead of just guarding the air base, committing the U.S. to a ground war. Taylor wrote that Johnson having \\"crossed the Rubicon\\" with Rolling Thunder \\"was now off to Rome on the double\\". On 20 April 1965, Johnson approved a plan to send 40, 000 U.S Army troops to South Vietnam by June. In June, Westmoreland reported \\"The South Vietnamese armed forces cannot stand up to this pressure without substantial U.S. combat troops on the ground\\" and stated that he needed 180, 000 men immediately, a request that was granted in July. In a telephone call to McNamara that unknown to the latter was being recorded, Johnson said \\"We know ourselves that when we asked for this Tonkin Gulf resolution, we had no intention of committing this many ground troops\\", leading McNamara to say \\"right\\". Johnson concluded: \\"And we're doin' so now and we know it's goin' be bad, and the question: do we just want to do it out on a limb by ourselves?\\" On 28 July 1965, Johnson gave a TV speech saying: \\"I have asked the commanding general, General Westmoreland, what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression. He has told me. And we will meet his needs. We cannot be defeated by force of arms. We will stand in Vietnam\\". In February 1966, Morse introduced a motion to repeal the resolution, which he argued was unconstitutional and had been used in ways that Johnson had promised that it would not be. Through Morse's motion had no chance of passing with Senate Majority Leader Mansfield fatalistically saying \\"we are in too deep now\\", he was able to extend the debate for two weeks. Morse who was described as a \\"skilled parliamentarian\\" was able to use various procedural methods to keep the debate going despite Mansfield's efforts, and several senators spoke in favor of the motion. Russell complained about the \\"very great grant of power\\" that the resolution had granted Johnson. Ultimately, most senators followed Johnson's argument that America was at war and it was the patriotic duty of Congress to support the president, no matter what, and only five senators voted for Morse's motion.  Repeal  By 1967, the rationale for what had become a costly U.S. involvement In the Vietnam War was receiving close scrutiny. With opposition to the war mounting, a movement to repeal the resolution‚Äîwhich war critics decried as having given the Johnson administration a \\"blank check\\"‚Äîbegan to gather steam. An investigation by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee revealed that Maddox had been on an electronic intelligence collection mission off the North Vietnamese coast. It also learned that the U.S. Naval Communication Center in the Philippine Islands, in reviewing ships' messages, had questioned whether any second attack had actually occurred. The administration of President Richard Nixon, which took office in January 1969, initially opposed repeal, warning of \\"consequences for Southeast Asia [that] go beyond the war in Vietnam\\". In 1970 the administration began to shift its stance. It asserted that its conduct of operations in Southeast Asia was based not on the resolution but was a constitutional exercise of the President's authority, as Commander in Chief of U.S. military forces, to take necessary steps to protect American troops as they were gradually withdrawn (the U.S. had begun withdrawing its forces from Vietnam in 1969 under a policy known as \\"Vietnamization\\"). Mounting public opinion against the war eventually led to the repeal of the resolution, which was attached to the Foreign Military Sales Act that Nixon signed in January 1971. Seeking to restore limits on presidential authority to engage U.S. forces without a formal declaration of war, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in 1973, over Nixon's veto. The War Powers Resolution, which is still in effect, sets forth certain requirements for the President to consult with Congress in regard to decisions that engage U.S. forces in hostilities or imminent hostilities.

The Uyghur Human Rights Project published his biography in Resisting Chinese Linguistic Imperialism: Abduweli Ayup and the Movement for Uyghur Mother Tongue-Based Education. Background Abduweli Ayup is a linguist specializing in Uyghur language education. He is a strong proponent of linguistic human rights, specifically, the right for the intergenerational transmission of language and culture. From December 2005 to June 2006, Abduweli was a visiting scholar at Ankara University, Turkey. He later received a Ford Foundation fellowship to study at the University of Kansas in the United States, and completed his master's degree in Linguistics in 2011. Upon graduation, Abduweli returned to Xinjiang and opened schools to teach Uyghur language, his mother tongue. Abduweli was arrested in Kashgar on August 20, 2013 by economic investigation team of Tianshan District, √úr√ºmqi City and accused of false funding and illegally raising funds for his proposed schools. Along with him, Dilyar Obul and Muhemmet Sidik Abdurshit, two of his partners involved with the school, were also detained. Abduweli suffered through illness while in prison, where he was held incommunicado for nearly nine months. He was not formally charged until May 17, 2014, when he and his partners were accused of having collected \\"illegal donations\\" to support their school. After a one-day trial on July 11, on August 21 the court convicted Abduweli and his associates of having \\"committed a crime of abusing public money.\\" According sentence in writing, aimed at opening mother language school, Abduweli and two of his partners had illegally accepted 590,000 CNY (about $95,000)in deposits from 17 people. During case processing time no one among the 17 have asked for their money back. Despite all of that Abduweli was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $13,000. Colleagues and human rights organizations contend that Abduweli's punishment is part of a government plan to marginalize and displace the Uyghur language. Abduwali was released on November 20, 2014, after his partners, Dilyar Obul and Muhemmet Sidik, appealed their verdict. Abduweli has returned to Kashgar, and continues to teach at his friends' language training school, which his wife, Miraghul, worked in his absence. In 2017, Erkin Ayup, brother of Abduweli Ayup, who had recently been promoted as head of oversight for the Organization Department of the Committee of the Communist Party of China in his hometown of Tokkuzak (Tuokezhake), Kona Sheher County (Shufu), Kashgar Prefecture, Xinjiang, went missing. In an interview conducted by Radio Free Asia, a staffer at his former office said he had been sent to a re-education camp near Kashgar Airport. Response The Linguistic Society of America and the Committee of Concerned Scientists appealed the President of China to investigate the circumstances under which Abduweli Ayup was detained, and petitioned for fair treatment as per China's obligations under International Law. Supporters created a Facebook page advocating justice for Abduweli.

It was formerly the episcopal seat of the diocese of Ariano, and is now that of the diocese of Ariano Irpino-Lacedonia. History and description Ariano Cathedral is a Romanesque building on a Latin cross groundplan, with three naves under groin vaulting, crossed by an elevated transept, terminating in the presbytery. The cathedral is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary and to Saint Ottone Frangipane and Saint Elz√©ar of Sabran, protectors of the city. In 1984 John Paul II granted it the title of a basilica minor. Originating from the 10th century and built on the ancient ruins of a temple of Apollo, the building has been repeatedly ravaged by earthquakes and pillaging, leading to countless repairs and refurbishments over the centuries. Of the original structure all that is known is that it was ruined in an earthquake of 988.possibly 989 or 990 It was quickly rebuilt, and the new cathedral remained standing until 1255, when the troops of Manfred stormed the city wall and destroyed the entire city, including the cathedral, because of its loyalty to the papacy. The new king, Charles of Anjou, when he had defeated Manfred, had all the places rebuilt which Manfred had destroyed, including Ariano and its cathedral, although it was not completed until 1309. The new building was devastated by the earthquakes of 1349 and 1456. The bishop at that time, Orso de Leone, undertook the responsibility of the rebuilding, of which remains can still be seen in the ancient crypt and in the lower part of the internal pilasters (now plastered). The cathedral suffered again in the earthquakes of 1688, 1702 and 1732. On the last occasion the then bishop, Filippo Tipaldi, completed the new construction in 1736, giving it the form and structure it has today. The interior is covered in plaster and stucco in Baroque style, hiding the pilasters and arches of massive stone, and leaving no sign of the preceding Romanesque and Gothic features. The cathedral and the bell tower by night Externally the west front is Romanesque with a gabled (or double sloped) roof, built in 1500 in green sandstone from Roseto. The three portals are also of this period, but the rose windows are later. The building, which is elevated above street level, is reached by an arrangement of steps of a later period. Ariano Cathedral has preserved a single thorn believed to have been taken from Jesus' crown of thorns. It has been recorded since 1633 that the thorn \\"bleeds\\" whenever Good Friday falls on 25 March, which is the traditional date for both the Annunciation and the Crucifixion of Christ. Even now the thorn and the treasure are retained in the Diocesan Museum of Silver, near the Cathedral.

She is a member of the Republican Party. Blair, who studied economics and Spanish at West Virginia University, deferred her spring semesters to attend the Legislature's 60-day spring session, making up her classes in the summer and fall. She has stated that she plans to become a financial advisor and will not continue a career in politics after graduating, serving at most eight years in the Legislature. She has said that she has \\"no desire to climb the political ladder. Therefore, I don‚Äôt see myself serving in any federal positions.\\" Blair's father is Craig Blair, a Republican member of the West Virginia Senate. He served as her campaign manager. Blair announced in 2018 that she would not seek re-election to the House. She was succeeded by Kump, who returned to office.  Electoral history  In the May 2014 Republican primary, at the age of 17, Blair defeated two-term incumbent 59th district delegate Larry Kump by 875 votes (54.55%) to 729 (45.45%). Kump, who had succeeded Blair's father Craig in the House of Delegates, said that he was not surprised he lost. He cited his independent voting record and the desire of the district's Republicans to be represented by a Delegate who would conform better to the party line. Her victory was notable in that, being only 17, she was too young to vote in an election that she won. In the November 2014 general election, Blair defeated the Democratic Party nominee, litigator Layne Diehl, also of Martinsburg, by 3,137 votes (62.69%) to 1,520 (30.38%), making her the youngest elected legislator in the United States. She was elected in the first election in which she was old enough to vote. Before running for office, Blair worked in her parents' apple orchard and for their water softening company. She donated $3,600 of her own money to her campaign, because \\"I wanted to show people that I had skin in the game.\\" Blair ran for re-election to a second term in 2016. She was unopposed in the Republican primary and faced Democratic nominee Catina \\"Cat\\" Webster in the general election. Blair defeated Webster by 5,863 votes (68.2%) to 2,731 (31.8%). She was, however, supplanted as the youngest state or federal legislator in the country by fellow Republican Josh Higginbotham, who was elected to the 13th District and is 12 days younger than Blair.  Political positions  Blair describes herself as \\"very conservative\\" and identifies as fiscally conservative, \\"pro-marriage\\" and \\"pro-family.\\" She opposes the morning-after pill and opposes abortion under any circumstances, even in the cases of rape and incest. She supports voter ID laws, requiring welfare recipients to be drug tested, term limits and making West Virginia a \\"right to work\\" state. During the 2016 legislative session, while speaking about a bill she sponsored that would allow concealed carry of firearms without a permit, Blair said she had received \\"multiple death threats\\" during her first year as a legislator. She said that the threats were largely gender motivated and not related to her political beliefs. In January 2016, Blair was named the chair of the Legislature's Eastern Panhandle Caucus. During her 2016 re-election campaign, Blair said that if re-elected, she hoped to be appointed to the House Education Committee, saying that improving education would help tackle the state's drug problem. She described herself as a \\"big proponent of career and technology schools\\", which she said were a better fit for some young people, who were made to feel \\"unsmart \\" by not attaining college degrees. She said that her sponsorship of the House's \\"pain- capable\\" abortion act, which prevents abortions after 20 weeks, was her proudest moment. In February 2018, Blair was the only member of the House of Delegates to vote against a bill to increase West Virginia teachers' pay by 5%. Blair stated: \\"We've already voted out a pay raise, one that was fair and within our budget.\\" References External links *Official page at the West Virginia Legislature Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Martinsburg, West Virginia Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:West Virginia University alumni Category:West Virginia Republicans Category:Members of the West Virginia House of Delegates Category:Women state legislators in West Virginia Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians ","title":"Saira Blair"},{"id":"42755023","text":"Denis Viktorovic Kaliberda (born 24 June 1990) is a German volleyball player of Ukrainian origins, a member of the Germany men's national volleyball team, a bronze medalist of the 2014 FIVB World Championship.

He was an influential figure in the development of sports journalism, who also worked covertly as a government informer. Life The son of Vincent Dowling (1756‚Äì1825), an Irish journalist and bookseller, and elder brother of Sir James Dowling and Alfred Septimus Dowling, he was born in London, and received his earlier education in Ireland. He returned to London with his father after the Anglo-Irish Union in 1801, and sometimes helped him in his duties for The Times. Soon after he went to work for the newspaper The Star, and in 1809 transferred to The Day. In 1804 he had become a contributor to The Observer, launching a working relationship with William Innell Clement that continued until Clement's death in 1852. Dowling was present in the lobby of the House of Commons when John Bellingham shot Spencer Perceval, on 11 May 1812, and was one of the first persons to seize the murderer, from whose pocket he took a loaded pistol. From open reporting on a meeting of radicals at Spa Fields in 1816, Dowling moved to gathering intelligence in public houses for the Home Office. He gave evidence at the trial of James Watson the Spencean in 1817. At times, Dowling went to great lengths to obtain early news for the Observer. When Queen Caroline was about to return from the continent, after the accession of George IV in June 1820, Dowling proceeded to France to record her progress, and being entrusted with her majesty's despatches, he crossed the Channel in an open boat during a stormy night, and was the first to arrive in London with the news. Dowling was appointed editor of Bell's Life in London in August 1824, a post he held for the rest of his life. He claimed to be the author of the plan on which the Metropolitan Police was organised; the names of the officers, inspectors, sergeants, and so on, were published in Bell's Life nearly two years before Sir Robert Peel spoke on the subject in 1829. He was active in London parish affairs; was constantly named stakeholder and referee in major sporting contests; and wanted to make boxing cleaner and more sporting. He died from disease of the heart, paralysis, and dropsy, at Stanmore Lodge, Kilburn, 25 October 1852. Works In 1840 Dowling wrote Fistiana, or the Oracle of the Ring, a work which he then made an annual. He was also the writer of the article on \\"Boxing\\" in Delabere Pritchett Blaine's Cyclop√¶dia of Rural Sports (1852, reprinted 1870). Family Frank Lewis Dowling, his son, took over the editorship of Bell's Life, though Henry Hall Dixon was given the refusal of it, and of Fistiana.

Oil palm Putra is a biologist who worked in Aceh Province, and who received a prize of $175,000 from his winning of the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2014. Putra was selected as the winner in the category 'Island and Island Nations'. He was recognized for his campaign to reclaim the land under illegal palm oil plantations in the Leuser Ecosystem, Sumatra, and to clear them in order to re-establish habitat for endangered orangutans, tigers, rhinos, and elephants, as well as lobbying against political plans to remove protected status from Aceh's primary forests. In 2013, these activities culminated in the establishment of a petition that asked the Indonesian government to enforce conservation law and reject the proposals in Aceh. The petition received more than 1.4 million signatures, increasing awareness of environmental issues in Indonesia and attracting widespread international condemnation. Sumatraanse Tijger Motivation As a high school student who grew up in the region of Aceh, Putra showed a keen interest in the natural world. He studied the biology and conservation of the Sumatran rhino: the smallest member of the most endangered rhinoceros in the family. Putra become an expert researcher and also a tracker, who led an expedition aiming to protects rhino in the field by pursuing and catching poachers in the Leuser Ecosystem. The area, which has an area of 6.4 million hectares of forest stretching from Aceh to North Sumatra, is federally protected and is one of the largest remaining habitats supporting the Sumatran rhino. Putra realised that in addition to attempting to stop illegal hunting, his efforts would not be complete without discussing and confronting the threat posed by habitat destruction from illegal logging and palm oil plantations. Further studies show the importance of forests for the 4 million people living close to the Leuser Ecosystem. Forests also provide protection from flooding; in the Leuser ecosystem the frequency and severity has been increasing. Putra sees it as his job not only to protect the rhinos and their habitat, but also the people of the region. Illegal palm oil plantations Bospad te Atjeh In the course of rescuing the land from the 'oilers' and enabling the natural ecosystems to regain their hold, Putra's approach was soundly based on grassroots innovations rather than direct lobbying of local government. This approach involved supporting a programme of local community education about the problem and how the scale of illegal logging threatens the lives not only of animals but also the people of Aceh. Putra created a chain of support from members of the community which started and gradually increased to include members of the government and police service. Currently, Putra oversees the recovery team that cut down the forest of palm trees in the Leuser Ecosystem. To this day, Putra has managed to reduce 26 illegal oil palm plantations. Twenty-four of these were closed willingly by the owners, whilst the other two were forcibly closed after a police operation following legal action. Awards Environmental activists from six regions of the world received an award as part of the Goldman Environmental Prize in San Francisco on 28 April 2014. Each year the award is worth a $175,000 award for the individuals who have shown huge courage and initiative against the odds to take action to protect their environment. The six winners in 2014 were Desmond D'sa is from South Africa, Suren Gazaryan from Russia, Ramesh Agrawal from India, Ruth Buendia from Peru, Helen Slottje from America, and Putra Son representing Indonesia. In 2013 Rudy won the Future For Nature Award, worth ‚Ç¨50,000 for individuals passionate about nature conservation.

Nance was shot and killed during a home invasion of a co-worker's residence; thus Nance was never formally charged, tried, or convicted of any murder. Authorities reported that physical evidence linked Nance to several unsolved murders and crimes.Mike Dennison Authorities Seek Clues of Suspected Serial Killer Associated Press October 25, 1986, accessed 03 April 2020 Murders =1970s= Nance is believed to have raped and murdered a middle-aged woman named Donna Pounds in 1974. Pounds had been shot and was held captive in her basement tied to a chair. Nance, an acquaintance of the victim's teenage son, was seen in the victim's back yard about the time of Pounds' death and was questioned by police who could not find firm evidence linking him to the crime. Years later, police later searched Nance's home and discovered evidence linking him to the Pounds murder. Nance served in the United States Navy from 1974 to 1977, and investigators later suspected he might have committed more crimes while traveling for his military service. =1980s= In January 1980, the badly decomposed body of 15-year-old Devonna Nelson was discovered on a roadbank close to the city of Missoula.To Kill and Kill Again pp. 150‚Äì151 Because of the condition of the body, her remains were not identified until February 1985. Prior to her identity being confirmed, she was dubbed \\"Betty Beavertail\\" after the nearby Beavertail Hill State Park. Nance is suspected of killing Nelson but has not been definitively linked to the crime. The body of Marcella Cheri \\"Marci\\" Bachmann, 16, was found in an advanced state of decomposition on December 24, 1984, by a hiker. The body had been buried in a shallow grave. Strong evidence indicates that Nance murdered Bachmann. Investigators found hair similar to Bachmann's in Nance's home. She had run away from Vancouver, Washington, due to conflict with her family members. She was killed by three gun shots to the head. Like Devonna Nelson, Bachmann was given a nickname before she was identified: \\"Debbie Deer Creek,\\" after a nearby drainage basin. Bachmann was identified in 2006 through DNA profiling. Her cremated remains were subsequently interred. Bachmann had been seen alive with Nance, who had \\"taken her in\\" after she was left by a trucker in the area. She may have used the alias name \\"Robin\\" and claimed to have been either native to Texas or had passed through the state. Nance claimed she had left the area in September 1984, which was about the time she was killed. Her brother Derek Bachmann had been searching for Marcella since he was 21 years old, along with a private investigator. He originally believed that she may have supported herself as a prostitute while away from home and may have become a victim of Gary Ridgway. Ridgway murdered at least 49 runaway children and prostitutes during the 1980s and 1990s. However, Marcella was never identified as one of his victims. On September 9, 1985, the skeleton of a Japanese or mixed-Asian woman, nicknamed \\"Christy Crystal Creek\\", was found in Missoula, Montana, with two .32 caliber bullets in her skull. Investigators believe she died between 1983 and 1985. Her identity has never been established. Christy was between 18 and 35 years old. She was estimated to be between 4 feet 10 and 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighed between 90 and 110 pounds. Examination indicated that she most likely had a history of smoking and had many fillings in her teeth, as well as two root canals. She also had had oral surgery that used characteristically Asian dental techniques, involving the screwing of a dental post into the tooth. Nance has not been definitively linked to this murder, but he is the only suspect. Nance is also responsible for the December 12, 1985, murders of Michael and Teresa Shook in Ravalli County, Montana, who were tied up inside their home and shot. The killer then attempted to destroy evidence by burning the house down. The couple's four children survived the crime. Items stolen from the Shook residence were later found in Nance's home. Death On September 3, 1986, Nance attempted to murder Doug and Kris Wells. Nance worked at the Wells's furniture moving company, and engaged Doug in friendly conversation while they were in the front yard of his home. Nance asked if he could borrow a flashlight, and after Doug invited him inside, Nance struck Doug in the head, before tying up him and Kris. Nance then stabbed Doug in the chest and left him to die in the basement. Nance forced Kris into the bedroom on the second floor to rape her. Although badly wounded, Doug managed to free himself and load one bullet in a rifle he had been repairing. Doug staggered up to the second floor where his wife was being assaulted in their bedroom. Nance and Doug engaged in further altercations, ending with Doug shooting and incapacitating Nance. Nance and the Wellses were rushed to a hospital, where Doug and Kris made full recoveries. Nance's injuries proved fatal, and he died the following day. After the incident with the Wellses, authorities investigated Nance's background and other crimes, initially noting similarities between the Wells incident and the murders of Michael and Teresa Shook.

It originally aired on FX in the United States on May 14, 2014. Plot After receiving Kate's message, Elizabeth proceeds to get Jared out and Philip stays to guard the house and the children. Paige questions Elizabeth about leaving late at night and she comes up with an implausible story about a client emergency at the travel agency. Paige is upset because Elizabeth had promised to help her pack for her upcoming church protest trip. After getting the children to sleep, Philip goes to the basement to signal the centre. Afterward, he sees Paige, who is skeptical about their story, in the kitchen. Then Philip talks to Elizabeth on the phone, referring to Jared cryptically because he knows that Paige is listening in. Elizabeth gets Jared into the car and drives off, not knowing that Larrick (Lee Tergesen) is already using a tracking device to monitor him. She explains that she worked with his parents and he needs to leave the country because he is in danger. After making him change clothes, she gets him onto a train toward extraction. Larrick loses track of them but quickly deduces that he will be on a train. He manages to discover Jared is going to Upstate New York. Jared arrives at the cabin where Elizabeth recuperated from her injuries, with Larrick just behind and on his trail. Philip and Elizabeth, still unaware that Larrick has left Nicaragua, worry that the things that happened to Jared could one day happen to Paige and Henry. Stan, who promised to get Nina out, buys a used car. When he returns to the safe house, he finds Arkady (Lev Gorn) with two thugs and a bruised Nina. Arkady tells Stan that Nina will be tried and executed in Moscow if he doesn't get them \\"Echo\\". Later, Stan, under the guise of a security review, gets Gaad to approve his checking out the stealth factory. Meanwhile, Philip and Elizabeth ask Fred to wear special shoes and wander into the secure area of the factory, so they can get samples of the radar-absorbing paint. Fred reluctantly agrees. Martha surprises Clark with classified documents stolen from the FBI, saying that his office should know about Gaad's weak security practices. When Clark expresses concern about the risk, she tells him that she loves him and reveals that she knows about his toup√©e. Later, after sex, Martha wonders when they could have children. Clark tells her that children are definitely not for him. Oleg (Costa Ronin) later sees Nina. He gives her a stack of cash, implying that she should leave as soon as Stan refuses to betray his country. During the field trip, Paige shares with Pastor Tim that she no longer trusts her parents. Stan visits the stealth factory that runs Echo. Production The episode was written by Joel Fields and the series creator Joe Weisberg, and directed by Andrew Bernstein.

Central questions include what is archaeology? What is the theoretical basis of archaeology? How should archaeology conceive of time? Why, and for who, is archaeology practiced. What is the nature and reality of the objects and processes of archaeological study? Analytic philosophy of archaeology investigates the logic behind concepts such as artefact, site, the archaeological record and archaeological cultures. These are just some examples of the metaphysical, aesthetic, epistemological, ethical and theoretical concerns at the heart of the practice of archaeology. In addition to these general questions, the philosophy of archaeology is also concerned with fieldwork methodology, integration of theory and collaboration with other disciplines, theories of measurement and data representation. Philosophy of archaeology can also denote a certain approach or attitude applied to the discipline, such as feminist, Marxist, humanist or processual for example. These approaches are generally referred to as \\"theory\\" by archaeologists and are sometimes conflated with, but are not the same as, analytic philosophy of archaeology. See Archeological theory for a full description of these approaches. There is currently little consensus amongst archaeologists on the nature of the problems in the philosophy of archaeology, or indeed in some cases, whether a philosophy of archaeology should, or even can, exist. As such, the discipline is not highly developed, with even its existence or relevance disputed by some archaeologists. However, it is generally recognised that an awareness of the philosophical issues and framework of the subject through research into the philosophy of archaeology is important for progress in the discipline as well as for designing research, controlling inference and interpretation, and in classification. History The roots of archaeological enquiry can be traced ultimately to mankinds urge to explain the origin of the world around them. These early cosmological explanations for the origins of the universe took the form of mythology. With the rise of complex civilisations such as Sumer, Babylon, Egypt and Persia, and with their increasingly sophisticated priesthood, these mythological explanations became also more sophisticated. These philosophies claimed that there was a beginning, an origin of all things, and conceived it as a formless void or Chaos out of which all matter was created. These explanations established the idea of a first principle or origin underlying and uniting all things, an idea that was passed into Greek as the word arch√©. =Greek Philosophy= Initially, in keeping with its origins, the arch√© in Greek thought was believed to be divine, as for example in the 8th century BC cosmogony of Hesiod. But, in the 7th century BC Thales of Miletus, taking the concept of the arch√© from mythology, was the first to say that it was not divine in origin, but natural. He went on to claim that the arch√© was water. The Greek philosophers that came after him continued the search for the arch√© in nature and because of this they were known as physiologoi (meaning physical or natural philosophers) to differentiate them from the theologoi, who based their philosophy on a supernatural basis. Archaeology therefore inherited the burden of explaining the origin of things, and how they change, both once the exclusive preserve of religion, without recourse to divine intervention. Thus, the scientific approach of archaeology can be traced in the west to the Ancient Greeks and their search for the origin or first principle of causation in nature rather than in the divine. Once the search for explanation was separated from divine sources and combined with principles such as Parmenides of Elea's dictum that nothing comes from nothing the search for the principles of causation led to the belief that the world and its processes could be rendered intelligible through rational thought. This led to the further realisation that the natural history and development of humanity might also be rationally investigated. In this way the principle of sufficient reason, the principle of causal synonymy, along with the axiom that nothing can come from nothing, led to the foundation of archaeological enquiry as a process of natural science. Archaeology is therefore a development of the early history of the philosophy of science The search for the arche was then applied to mankind, leading to the first theories of the evolution of organisms. However, despite philosophers realisation that mankind must have been once more primitive, and some attempts towards explaining the development of human speech along evolutionary lines, archaeology In the Classical world remained a predominantly philosophical pursuit. =Submersion and Recovery= Its development was interrupted by the rise of Christian scholasticism and the re- establishment of divine origin explanations in western culture in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. The recovery of concepts was spurred by the rediscovery of Lucretius' Epicurean poem \\"On Nature\\" which set out an archaeological explanation for the evolution of humans. The revival of Classical studies during the Renaissance was an archaeological exercise though not scientific in its process. =Modern Development= Developments in the 19th century with Hutton's and Lyell's theory of uniformitarianism and Darwin's theory of natural selection both of which set the stage for the modern scientific investigation into the origin of humanity. Epistemology Archaeological epistemology concerns what archaeological knowledge is, its particularities, how can it be acquired, and the extent to which archaeological knowledge of a subject or entity can be known. Also the subjective nature of archaeological enquiry is recognised. For example, is there one true objective past or multiple subjective ones. It also tries to ascertain the standards that should apply to claims to archaeological knowledge. What is belief or truth in relation to the past? As Alison Wylie explained, \\"[w]hat you find, archaeologically, has everything to do with what you look for, with the questions you ask and the conceptual resources you bring to bear in attempting to answer them.\\" Vivian James carries this further by saying that context is the epistemological result of archaeological praxis. Thus what you look for, what questions you ask, and your conceptual resources are the context which is the epistemological result. Ontology The ontology of archaeology is concerned with what archaeological entities exist, can be said to exist, and what their relations to each other might be. For example, what is an artefact, a site or a culture and do they exist as separate entities? If entities are agreed to exist how should they be categorised or recorded. A branch of research in archaeological ontology is known as typology which attempts to sort objects into classes based on physical characteristics. The existence and nature of time is also of concern in archaeological ontology. For example, what effect does periodisation, e.g. the three age model, have on archaeological theory and practice. Questions of the ontological nature of both time and objects are of great importance in the design of archaeological databases and are of increasing importance as the computerisation of archaeological processes and data increases. Theory The philosophy of archaeology is also concerned with the construction of theories within the discipline. Archaeology is a theoretically fragmented field with no generally applied interpretative theory underpinning the discipline. A multitude of different theoretical approaches have developed over the last 50 years and exist in parallel across the discipline. These range broadly from an empirical archaeology viewed as a science, to a relativistic post-modern concept of archaeology as an ideology that cannot verify its own concepts. Therefore, the search for a unifying explanatory theory is a major concern among philosophers of archaeology. However, even the possibility of such a theory is denied by some archaeologists, emphasising the dislocation in archaeological approaches. Ethics Archaeological ethics investigates issues surrounding the use of archaeological sites and materials. Who sanctions, controls and pays for such use is often disputed. For example, concerning the rights of indigenous people, especially in colonial situations where archaeology may be used to support narratives of oppression or dispossession. Or those whose beliefs are incompatible with certain archaeological practices, such as the removal of bodies from ancient graveyards. Other examples include the use of archaeology for political purposes, such as land claims, or to prop up regimes or certain ideologies for example the notorious Ahnenerbe under the Third Reich. The study of bias in archaeological narratives for example the association of archaeology with colonial history and subsequent issues over ownership of artifacts. For example, the continuing controversy over the Elgin marbles.http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1883142_1883129_1883001,00.html References Archaeology Category:Archaeological theory Archaeology ","title":"Philosophy of archaeology"},{"id":"42755381","text":"Vows is an indie, psychedelic band formed in New Jersey and Vermont in 2011 with their first release in April titled, Winter's Grave.

Declaratively, guarded Horn clauses are read as ordinary logical implications: : However, procedurally, when there are several clauses whose heads match a given goal, then all of the clauses are executed in parallel, checking whether their guards hold. If the guards of more than one clause hold, then a committed choice is made to one of the clauses, and execution proceeds with the subgoals of the chosen clause. These subgoals can also be executed in parallel. Thus concurrent logic programming implements a form of \\"don't care nondeterminism\\", rather than \\"don't know nondeterminism\\". History The first concurrent logic programming language was the Relational Language of Clark and Gregory, which was an offshoot of IC-Prolog. Later versions of concurrent logic programming include Shapiro's Concurrent Prolog and Ueda's Guarded Horn Clause language. The development of concurrent logic programming was given an impetus when GHC was used to implement KL1, the systems programming language of the Japanese Fifth Generation Project (FGCS). The FGCS Project was a $400M initiative by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, begun in 1982, to use massively parallel computing/processing for artificial intelligence applications. The choice of concurrent logic programming as the ‚Äúmissing link‚Äù between the hardware and the applications was influenced by a visit to the FGCS Project in 1982 by Ehud Shapiro, who invented Concurrent Prolog.

After graduating from Stuyvesant High School, he attended City College of New York for three years, where he majored in science. Before completing his undergraduate studies, he joined the United States Air Force, serving in the Philippines and in World War II from 1943 to 1945. Post-war, he switched his focus and completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, where he studied under surrealist Leon Kelly, abstract expressionist George McNeil and geometric abstractionist Ilya Bolotowsky. He earned a master's degree in fine arts and art education from Columbia University in New York in 1951.Harold Garde, Courthouse Gallery of Fine Art.

Career =Teaching= After graduating from Columbia, Garde worked for 15 years in New York City's commercial interior design industry. In 1968, now married with four children, he began teaching art at Nassau Community College in Garden City, New York, and at a secondary school in Port Washington, New York, while continuing to paint professionally. In an effort to produce art full-time, Garde retired from teaching in 1984.Nancy Davidson, ‚ÄúAvant Garde,‚Äù Portland Monthly, September 2013. =Painting= Abstract expressionist art mixed with surrealist and figurative elements defined Garde's early work. In the early 1980s, his subjects transitioned from rounded human figures to structural shapes, segueing to series of objects, such as chairs, vases and kimonos.Jeanne M. Dowis, \\"Lexicon,\\" Harold Garde. Painting. 50 Years., Museum of Florida Art: DeLand, Florida, 2008, pp. 92-95.Suzette Lane McAvoy, \\"Work in Maine,\\" Harold Garde. Painting. 50 Years., Museum of Florida Art: DeLand, Florida, 2008, pp. 10-15, 52-57. Some of his paintings focus on a sequence of letters or numbers. Garde's work in Maine incorporates colors far more vibrant than those from his earlier years in New York. He has attributed this transformation to Maine's natural light, and wanting his paintings to be brighter and fresher in his advanced age. Some mediums include acrylics on canvases of various size, ceramic and clay sculptures, and Strappo prints.Matthew J. Palm, ‚ÄúHarold Garde exhibits masterworks at Orlando‚Äôs Jai Gallery,‚Äù Orlando Sentinel, March 28, 2014. Garde had his first solo exhibition in 1970 in Huntington, New York.

Original pieces are displayed inside, with a reproduction installed on the building's exterior fa√ßade since the 2012 acquisition.

Transferring dried acrylic paint layers from glass or another smooth surface onto paper or canvas produces a layered image's reversal and Strappo monotype. In celebration of his 90th birthday and as a New Year's challenge, Garde created one new Strappo print each day for the first 90 days of 2013.

Created by Matt Miller, it centers on the character of Dr. Henry Morgan, an immortal New York City medical examiner who uses his extensive knowledge to assist the New York City Police Department (NYPD) in solving crimes and to discover a way to end his immortality. Flashbacks within each episode reveal various details of Henry's life. The series' network aired a sneak preview on September 22, 2014, and resumed the series at 10 p.m. EST on September 23, 2014. Reception of the series was mixed. In the United States, television critics were divided over the series' similarity to other crime dramas and its premise. In contrast, voters in several online polls ranked the series as one of the best of the television season. Forevers broadcast was well received in France and Spain. Although ABC gave the series a full-season episode order on November 7, 2014, it cancelled Forever after one season. ABC cited the show's low ratings as the rationale behind the decision. Television critics believed that other factors explained the network's decision, as the show gained viewers who watched up to seven days later on their DVRs. Fans of the series reacted strongly, creating a social media campaign to save the series; despite these efforts, the series remains canceled. Premise Dr. Henry Morgan (Ioan Gruffudd) is a New York City medical examiner who studies the dead for criminal cases, and to solve the mystery of his own immortality. Since his first death 200 years ago while trying to free slaves as a doctor aboard a ship in the African slave trade, Henry disappears almost immediately each time he dies and returns to life naked in a nearby body of water. Having also stopped aging, Henry's long life has given him broad knowledge and remarkable observation skills which impress most people he encounters, including New York Police Department Detective Jo Martinez (Alana de la Garza). Only antiquarian, Abe (Judd Hirsch), whom Henry and his now-deceased wife Abigail found as a newborn in a German concentration camp during World War II, knows that he is immortal. Henry is stalked by \\"Adam\\", who is also an immortal, and claims to have been alive for around 2,000 years. Cast and characters =Main= * Ioan Gruffudd as Doctor Henry Morgan: : Born in 1779, Henry is a New York City medical examiner who studies the dead for criminal cases and to solve the mystery of his immortality. His first death was in 1814 while trying to free slaves as a doctor aboard a ship in the African slave trade. Since that time, Henry disappears each time he dies and returns to life naked in a nearby body of water. He has been married twice; his first wife Nora, whom he married before he became immortal, had him committed to an asylum, and his second wife, Abigail, whom he met during the Second World War and remained with until 1984, when she left to find somewhere they could be together without being judged for Abigail's apparently greater age. He abandoned his original career as a doctor in 1956 after he and a butcher were shot; Henry chose to crawl away and die instead of trying to save the other man because he feared others finding out his secret. Although knowledgeable about many topics, Henry demonstrates a general lack of knowledge about modern popular culture. He also dislikes cell phones but will use one if necessary. * Alana de la Garza as Detective Jo Martinez: : Jo is a sharp, no-nonsense, determined detective with the NYPD who is both intrigued and disgusted by Henry's detailed medical knowledge when examining a corpse. She finds his behavior to be \\"out there\\", but still relies on his insight for solving homicides. Originating from a rough background with a law-breaking father, she is also a recent widow; her husband was a lawyer who died of an unexpected heart attack while running on a treadmill on a visit to Washington a year before she met Henry. She is stationed at the 11th Precinct. * Joel David Moore as Lucas Wahl: : Henry's assistant in the Medical Examiner's office, who expresses uncertainty about how little he knows about his boss, and an uncanny memory for his daily activities. He studied film in college before working in the medical examiner's office. He makes horror films in his spare time; in the episode, \\"The Last Death of Henry Morgan\\", Lucas confesses to using the morgue as a set for several of his movies. Lucas tends to use popular culture references in his speech, many of which Henry does not understand. * Donnie Keshawarz as Detective Mike Hanson: : Jo's partner, who is stationed at the 11th Precinct. He was in a band when he was younger, a characteristic added at the request of AfterBuzz TV hosts Kate Aquillano, Marielou Mandl, and Pegah Rad and of fans of the series who watched the after show. He is married and has two sons. He also has a brother. During an earlier interview with AfterBuzz TV, Keshawarz discussed Hanson's role as Henry's foil, namely Hanson's orthodox methodology in solving cases and knowledge accumulated over a limited lifetime contrasting with Henry's unorthodox ways and extensive knowledge gathered over a long life. This was particularly demonstrated in \\"The King of Columbus Circle\\", when both deduced that their victim had been suffering from cancer, Henry observing various tell-tale signs of chemotherapy such as stained hands and slight hair-loss while Hanson just noticed the medical alert bracelet the dead man was wearing. * Lorraine Toussaint as Lieutenant Joanna Reece: Jo and Hanson's supervisor at the 11th Precinct. * Judd Hirsch as Abraham \\"Abe\\" Morgan: : Henry's adopted son and main confidant. No one knows Dr. Henry Morgan better than his son, Abe. The keeper of Henry's immortality secret, although he has claimed that he worked with Henry's father to explain their association to strangers. At the end of World War II, he was rescued from Belsen, after surviving a death march from Auschwitz. He currently owns an antique store where Henry uses the basement for his immortality research on himself. Abe fought in the Vietnam War and has a two-time ex-wife named Maureen Delacroix (Jane Seymour). Abe's research into his family tree revealed that he is a distant relative of Henry's, as one of his ancestors was the illegitimate son of Henry's womanizing uncle. =Recurring= * MacKenzie Mauzy as Abigail Morgan: :Henry's second wife and Abe's adoptive mother. Henry met her toward the end of World War II when they were working as medical personnel near one of the Nazi concentration camps. Over the years, she worked as a nurse in addition to being a housewife. The latest time period in which Abigail has been shown is 1982, when she was still married to Henry but looked a generation older than he (Janet Zarish); in 1984, she vanished without a trace despite Henry's best efforts to find her. Henry has acknowledged that the end of his relationship with Abigail caused him a lot of pain that prevents him from dating anyone for whom he has real feelings. In the episode \\"The Night in Question\\", Henry learns from Adam that Abigail killed herself after a car crash to prevent Adam from finding Henry. Abigail appears in ten episodes. * Burn Gorman as Lewis Farber / \\"Adam\\": :A 2,000-year-old immortal who claims that he \\"has been here since the beginning\\" and that he has not found a death for himself. Analysis of his blood revealed that he had contracted several extinct diseases, including the bubonic plague. Adam was tortured as part of the Nazis' research into his immortality, leaving him with a hatred of the Nazis and a sympathy for other Holocaust survivors, including Abe. Adam first appeared as Henry's appointed psychiatrist and convinced a patient that he could pass on his immortality. Adam continued to try to find a lost dagger, one that not only caused Adam's first death but also was used to kill Julius Caesar. Adam appears in five episodes. Episodes Production =Origin= The concept for Forever came from a conversation between series creator Matt Miller and his five-year-old son about death. After the conversation, Miller began to imagine what life would be like if a person was immortal but everyone else, including that person's own children, were mortals. He created a character who viewed immortality as a curse because of the pain of seeing family and friends die and who would attempt to find a way to end his immortality. That concept informed Miller's decision to make his character a doctor-turned-medical examiner who used his occupation for research into his immortality and Miller's decision to structure the series as a procedural. The details about the character's immortality and his ability and his desire to end it would serve as the series' main story arc. Another series-long story arc explored how other people learn of Henry's immortality. The first storyline in the arc was the season's second story arc, Henry's determination to learn the identity of a second immortal who knows about it. The second immortal character's morals would contrast his protagonist's morals, serving as an antagonist for the main character. As for the family element, Miller created a family with a 35-year- old immortal having a mortal son in his 70s. Miller stated in an interview with BuddyTV writer Catherine Cabanela that he had never seen that type of family on television before, and he believed that it provide the show with an emotional element. To demonstrate Henry's immortality, Miller decided that Henry would die and would feel the pain every time he died. Anything on Henry's body would disappear with his body during each death. Miller felt that Henry's naked rebirth in water would be an interesting way to keep the show's protagonist alive during the series by completing the death and rebirth process; the nakedness would create several comedic moments within the series. Miller intended to use Henry's death and rebirth process sporadically after the first two episodes so that the series would focus on Henry's long life. =Casting= The first person cast was Judd Hirsch as Abe. When Miller and casting director Barbara Fiorentino developed a list of actors for the role, they felt that Hirsch would be the best actor to portray Abe. Hirsch was the first person asked about the role. When they sent the script to him, Hirsch liked the series' premise, its historical aspect, its intelligence, and the idea that the audience would see life from Henry's perspective. Two days after casting Hirsch, Ioan Gruffudd was cast as Dr. Henry Morgan. Miller wanted the actors to read the script so that he could see whether the audience would believe that the man had been alive for over 200 years. The search for an actor to portray Henry was more difficult than Miller expected. Miller and Fiorentino unsuccessfully auditioned actors from New York City, Los Angeles, Canada, London, Australia, and South Africa for the role, but the role was uncast. One day, Miller noticed Gruffudd in the carpool lane while they picked up their children from preschool. For Miller, Gruffudd's period work, such as in the series Horatio Hornblower, made him an obvious selection for the role. Gruffudd liked the script and felt that he could portray Henry. The story, the science fiction element, and the believability also attracted Gruffudd to the role. Alana de la Garza was cast as NYPD Detective Jo Martinez. The show's procedural aspect, the series' serialized nature, and the believability of the world interested de la Garza. She also liked the idea that, in contrast to de la Garza's characters on other procedurals, Jo had flaws. Joel David Moore, Donnie Keshawarz, and Barbara Eve Harris were the last three cast for the series. Harris was cast as NYPD Lieutenant Roark. Originally the role of Lieutenant Roark was written as a male character, but Fiorentino cast Harris in the role. Lorraine Toussaint replaced Harris after the pilot, and Toussaint's first appearance as Lieutenant Joanne Reece was in the episode \\"Look Before You Leap\\". To prepare for her role, Toussaint visited the morgue and viewed a few autopsies. The character of Lt. Reece was to play a larger role in the series, but her scenes were cut so that the episodes could fit time constraints. The DVDs include the deleted scenes. Moore was cast as assistant medical examiner Lucas Wahl. Both Miller and Fiorentino knew Moore from his previous work with both of them. Moore and Miller met when Moore guest starred on Miller's previous series Chuck. Both Miller and Fiorentino, a personal friend of Moore's, discussed the pilot and the role with Moore. Moore liked the idea of Lucas providing comedic moments to the series. For Lucas' personality, Miller asked Moore to include several of his own personality traits when portraying Lucas. Keshawarz as NYPD Detective Mike Hanson. The casting department initially did not feel that Keshawarz could portray a NYPD detective, but his work on Homeland convinced them otherwise. The Arkansas- raised Keshawarz imitated a New York accent for Forever. As for the character's name, the writers did not give Hanson a first name until the fifth episode \\"The Pugilist Break\\" when Jo addressed Hanson as \\"Mike\\" during a scene. Miller did not learn about the name until later when Keshawarz mentioned it to him in a conversation about the episode. As for the recurring character of Henry's stalker Adam, Miller and Fiorentino cast Burn Gorman in the role. as Adam. Gorman voiced the character during the pilot and the second episode. Adam made his first physical appearance in the episode \\"Skinny Dipper\\", which aired on December 9, 2014. =Writing= Beginning with the pilot, Miller structured each episode by telling two stories in the episode. The first was a traditional procedural plotline. The second story was a flashback from Henry's past. The flashback either related to the episode's main present-day storyline, such as Henry's involvement in investigating the Jack the Ripper case, or was a scene from Henry's backstory, such as his life in the Lower East Side's tenements in the 1890s. Both the father-son relationship between Henry and Abe and one of the two season-long story arcs, Henry's relationship with his wife Abigail, were told through flashbacks. When planning an episode, the writers started with the idea for the episode and determined the main story arc. They discussed which plot element could be associated with a previous incident from Henry's life and how the flashbacks connected the two stories. From there, they determined Abe's viewpoint about the case or his connection to the case. Then, they planned the story on whiteboard. One plot device used in the pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be difficult to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out of his pocket so that it would not disappear with the rest of his body. It became more difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes. =Effects= Ioan Gruffudd Miller and the filming crew had planned to film the rebirth scenes in the pilot in several bodies of water, but they could film it in only one location. During the episode's production, Gruffudd and the crew filmed the rebirth scene against a green screen in a university swimming pool due to the strength of the East River's current. The crew later covered Gruffudd with water. To depict Henry's death in different years, the crew refilmed the scene with Gruffudd wearing various hair styles. The producers then edited the scene by superimposing the film of Gruffudd's swim in the pool with film of the East River to give the illusion that the scene occurred in the river. =Title dispute= Forever is also the title of a 2003 novel by writer Pete Hamill, with a similar premise: an Irishman is granted the gift of immortality by an African sangoma, yet must remain in Manhattan or the gift is renounced. On May 21, 2014, Warner Bros. Television received a letter from RadicalMedia requesting that the name of the series be changed. RadicalMedia stated in the letter that Miller's character, setting, and title were very similar to Hamill's. The letter also stated that Sundance Studios had begun to develop a television series based on the novel. According to Warner Bros. studio representatives, Miller never read the novel when developing Forever. As of September 2014, Hamill has no plans to proceed with a lawsuit. Reception Forever received mixed reviews from critics in the beginning. Rotten Tomatoes gave the show a rating of 57%, based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The site's consensus stated, \\"Forever star Ioan Gruffudd is appealing, but his charm can't overcome the show's gimmicky, unrealized premise.\\" Metacritic gave the show a score of 54 out of 100, based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". TV Guides Matt Roush felt that the series could become a hit similar to Bones and Castle. Other critics felt that the series had issues. Zap2it.com's Sarah Huggins liked the concept for the series and Gruffudd's performance, but she felt that the first two episodes were inconsistent \\"in tone and story\\". Both Varietys Brian Lowery and Adweeks Sam Thielman believed that Forever could not last as it faced CBS' Person of Interest in the 10 p.m. timeslot and as Forevers lead-in, Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., had dropped in the ratings during its first season. Lowery also believed that the lack of answers about Henry's immortality could not sustain the series. The Hollywood Reporters Tim Goodman concurred, feeling that the lack of answers about Henry's immortality could pose problems for viewers. Still others felt that the series was a derivative of other series. Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com felt that the series was a derivative of Sherlock Holmes. Although Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly felt that Forever was a derivative of other procedurals, she stated that the show was \\"breezy and entertaining and reasonably clever, at least when its Sherlock Scanning isn't out of control\\" due to the performances of Gruffudd, de la Garza, and Hirsch and due to Miller's conceptualization of the series. When Miller pitched the show to the various networks, network executives compared the series to New Amsterdam. New Amsterdam, a short-lived drama which aired on Fox in 2008, featured a 400-year-old male NYPD detective and a female partner. Miller stated that he had not heard about the series until he read some comments on an industry website. Television critics also took notice of the similarities between New Amsterdam and Forever. USA Todays Robert Bianco thought that Forever took a \\"smarter, lighter approach to the subject\\" of immortality than New Amsterdam did. Lowery, Roush, and Busis all noted the similarities between the two series in their reviews of Forever. In France, Forever became an international hit. The premiere on April 28, 2015 attracted 7.08 million viewers. During the series' broadcast in France, Forever averaged an audience of about 5.7 million viewers, or 26.2% of the total French audience, making it France's most-watched series on Tuesday nights. After the broadcast of the final episode, French fans of Forever joined English-speaking fans in their social media campaign to save the series. When Forever premiered on Spain's Antena 3 on July 15, 2015, it drew 2,316,000 viewers. Over the course of the series, Forever averaged over 1.679 million viewers, making it a successful series in Spain. The series' success in spite of its cancellation in the United States prompted Rebeca Cortes of El Norte de Castilla to call Forever \\"the summer surprise\\". The German paid-television channel Sat.1 Emotions began airing the first twelve episodes of Forever on February 3, 2015, but the series did not begin airing on Sat.1 on July 20, 2015. The ratings fluctuated throughout the run from the 2.02 million viewers which watched the pilot, but ratings never dipped below 1.44 million viewers. During Forevers run in Germany, the series averaged 1.82 million viewers and a 6.3 percent audience share; the series' market share was lower than Sat.1's average. Among viewers between the ages of 14 and 49, however, the show averaged 0.96 million viewers and a 9.4 percent market share, which was near the network's average. In 2016, TF1 began rebroadcasting Forever on July 23. Germany's kabel eins began its rebroadcast of Forever on September 23, 2016. =Awards and online polls= Forever has been nominated for three awards and has improved ranking in two online polls.

That, and Forevers performance in the 10 p.m. timeslot being better than ABC's performance in that timeslot during the 2013‚Äì2014 television season, convinced ABC to pick up additional episodes of the series. Forever received a full-season order on November 7, 2014. Forever airs a day before the U.S. on CTV in Canada. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the show was acquired by Sky1. It premiered on October 2, 2014. The series premiered on Nine Network in Australia on February 11, 2015. In New Zealand, TV One debuted Forever on February 16, 2015. =Video on demand= On July 1, 2016, The CW announced that Forever was available to stream on the free digital-only network CW Seed. =Series cancellation= Before the season finale aired, Miller and the writers proposed the storyline for season two to ABC and to Warner Bros. They pitched the idea of season two exploring the ramifications of Jo or another character, aside from Abe, learning about Henry's immortality, romance, and the pleasures associated with immortality. They also planned to introduce several new characters to the series. In an interview with Entertainment Weeklys Natalie Abrams, Miller stated that ABC appeared to like the direction of the show's second season. On May 7, however, ABC announced the series' cancellation. Gruffudd's wife Alice Evans told fans about the cancellation on Twitter; Gruffudd posted a letter on Instagram detailing his reaction to the series' cancellation and thanking the show's fans for their support a few hours later. In the meantime, Warner Bros. and Miller began to shop the series to other networks. On July 7, Miller posted a letter to fans on Twitter stating that, as of that date, Warner Bros. had been unable to find another studio to produce the series and that the studio was still shopping it around to the networks. During a Twitter question-and-answer session on September 17, 2015, Miller revealed the characters that he wanted to introduce and the character who would learn of Henry's immortality in season 2. Officially, the network cited that Forevers live ratings was the main factor behind the series' cancellation. The pilot episode drew 8.26 million viewers live, but the finale drew 4.13 million live. On average, the series drew 4.93 million viewers live and a 1.12 adults 18‚Äì49 demographic weekly. In term of the Nielsen ratings' Live+7 Day ratings, Forever averaged 7.034 million viewers and drew a 1.7 adults 18‚Äì49 demographic. About 3.23 million people, or about 68% of Forevers audience, watched the series within seven days of the episodes original broadcast. Forever had the 19th-highest lift in total viewers for the 2014‚Äì2015 television season. In addition, Forever had the 7th-largest increase in adults 18‚Äì49 from DVR viewing during the season. It was among the top 20 programs that received the largest increase in adults 18‚Äì49 within the first three days of viewing, and it received the 14th-highest increase in adults 18‚Äì49 from Live+3-Day to Live+7-Day viewing. Television critics believed that live ratings was not the only factor in ABC's cancellation of Forever. The Orange County Registers Michael Hewitt and Adweeks Jason Lynch noted that several of ABC's other low-rated shows, in particular ABC's limited series American Crime, received renewals in spite of ratings that were similar to Forevers. American Crime had an average audience of 4.98 million viewers live and a 1.16 adults 18‚Äì49 demographic weekly; its Live+7 Day audience, however, averaged 6.697 million viewers and a 1.7 adults 18‚Äì49 demographic. Verne Gay of Newsday, Nellie Andreeva of Deadline Hollywood, and Stephen Battaglio of the Los Angeles Times pointed out that ABC renewed series produced by ABC Studios as a part of the network's decision to increase ownership of their series to compete with Netflix and Hulu. Forever, produced by Warner Bros., was one of three cancellations for the network, the other two being Resurrection and Cristela. Kate Stanhope of The Hollywood Reporter and Matt Roush of TV Insider felt that Forevers time slot was a factor for the low ratings. Stanhope mentioned that Forever was airing opposite NBC's Chicago Fire and CBS' Person of Interest, both established series on their respective networks while Roush believed that Forever did not have a strong lead-in in. John Sica, a reporter for The Rockaway Times who had worked on the series, cited a lack of promotion and an inconsistent scheduling of episodes during Forevers run as factors that led to the series cancellation. Fan reaction Before the series' cancellation, Forever placed fourth in USA Todays 18th annual \\"Save Our Shows\\" poll. When ABC announced the cancellation of Forever, fans were outraged, and some left angry messages on ABC's Facebook page. Using the hashtag #SaveForever, others began a social media campaign on Facebook and Twitter to save the series. An online petition on Change.org generated over 6,500 signatures within two days of being created, and it generated over 12,600 signatures in three days. By May 27, it had generated nearly 27,000 signatures. Some have had requested that Netflix or another network take over the production of the series. By November 5, 2015, the petition generated 107,150 signatures. The cancellation generated a discussion on social media. When TVLine posted a story about the cancellation, it generated 2,175 comments, making it the third most talked-about story in the site's five-year history. About 43.70% of Entertainment Weekly online readers voted it as the most-missed cancellation in Entertainment Weeklys online poll. A fan-made, non-profit, unofficial graphic novel, titled \\"Forever & Ever!\\", debuted on Facebook on January 5, 2016. According to one of the comic series' co-creators, the novel expands the fictional universe created by Miller by introducing new material and new characters. =Ratings= In Australia, the first episode was watched by 619,000 viewers, making it the fourteenth most- watched broadcast that night. The second one was viewed by 522,000 viewers, making it the twentieth most-watched. In Canada, the first and second episodes received 2.32 and 1.57 million viewers, respectively. In the United Kingdom, the premiere garnered 847,000 viewers, making it the highest-rated broadcast on the network that week. Note: The ratings must be searched for. In New Zealand, it was the third most-watched broadcast in prime time that night, with 243,650 viewers. Home video releases Miller revealed that Warner Bros. would release DVDs for the series during a Twitter question-and-answer session on September 17, 2015. On November 16, 2015, Warner Home Entertainment of Canada announced that DVDs for the series would be released on January 19, 2016. That day, Warner Bros. announced it would be made available in the United States through the company's Warner Archive Collection as a manufacture-on-demand title. The DVD contained all 22 episodes of the series on five discs, along with deleted scenes from many of the episodes. The Region 4 DVD was released on February 3, 2016. Streaming The series is available to stream on The CW's free digital-only network, CW Seed.

The nine games played between Belgium and England's amateur team are not considered as official by the opponents; this also applies to a game played between Belgium and England in 1946, which is classified by the English FA as an unofficial 'Victory International'. While the Belgian Football Association does not take several Olympic Games matches of Belgium into account, according to the RSSSF there is no reason to doubt about the official character.  1900s  The earliest four games played by a national selection of players active in Belgium, with the Netherlands as opponent between 1901 and 1904, were not yet considered as official because of the presence of English players in the \\"Belgian\\" squad.. Extract consulted online on 30 August 2010 on Beerschot Athletic Club  1910s  Probably because of the war period (World War I), results of matches between 1915 and 1918 are not shown in official overviews. The Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, however, listed three France‚ÄìBelgium matches in this period together with the matches between 1905 and 1914, without noting a difference in status. In the 1918 match Albert I, King of the Belgians, handed out a cup trophy for the winners.  1920s  Apart from the official biannual Low Countries derbies, Belgium played against the Netherlands for diverse purposes in the 1920s; the 1925 and 1926 matches served as fundraiser for FIFA and charity, respectively, and in the 1929 match the Royal Dutch Football Association's 40th anniversary was celebrated.  1930s  Outside the official biannual Low Countries derbies, Belgium faced the Netherlands for diverse reasons in the 1930s; the 1930 match served to inaugurate the new national stadium, the two matches in 1932 served as fundraiser for FIFA and charity, and the 1939 match was at the occasion of the Royal Dutch Football Association's 50th anniversary.  1940s  During the occupation of Belgium in World War II, Belgium played multiple unofficial friendlies abroad against teams of allied nations. These included two selections of the English FA that contained some Scottish and Welsh players at both occasions.  2010s  The matches against Romania on 14 November 2012 and against Luxembourg on 26 May 2014 were scheduled as official friendlies but afterwards not recognized by FIFA because of Romania's 8 substitutions and Belgium's 7 substitutions respectively, while only 6 were allowed. The Belgian and Czech football federations were too late in asking that the match against Czech Republic on 5 June 2017 would be official.

It is both the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of the Dominican Republic and the home of an Interdenominational church. History The first Anglican church in the Dominican Republic was Holy Trinity, which was established in San Pedro de Macor√≠s in 1897. The present church building was completed in 1930 and largely destroyed by Hurricane San Zen√≥n before it could be used. Insurance money was used to rebuild the structure. The Episcopal Church was diminished in the Dominican Republic during the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo. Epiphany's vicar, the Rev. Charles Raymond Barnes, was murdered for describing in letters the massacre of Haitians at the border. The charter of the Community Church of Santo Domingo is signed on May 22, 1955. They met in the chapel of the International Hospital under the pastoral care of the Rev. Maurice Daily. There was an attempt at the time to work with Epiphany. By the early 1960s the English speaking community in Santo Domingo continued to decrease in numbers and the Community Church was no longer self-supporting. The decision was made in 1968 for the Community Church to share the Epiphany Church building and its vicar, but to hold separate worship services. The Dominican Republic became a missionary diocese in the Episcopal Church in 1970. The Rt. Rev. Tel√©sforo Isaac becomes the first Dominican bishop of the Dominican Episcopal diocese in 1972. In 1974 the English speaking congregations are joined, and each congregation's services are held on alternating Sundays. Spanish language Episcopal services were restarted the same year. Four years later in 1978 the Community Church is renamed the Union Church of Santo Domingo, as it is a more common name used in interdenominational churches associated with the National Council of Churches in the United States.

Established in 1972, it is focused on five main educational areas: Engineering, Medicine, Management, Law and Life Sciences. The institutions offer both foundation courses in these areas, as well as specializations, with a Bachelors, Master or PhD degree. It was upgraded to a university status in 2013. History PESU RR is managed by the People's Education Society (PES), which founded the institution in 1972, in a rented gymnasium in Bengaluru, with around 40 students. PES currently manages over 45 educational programs in Karnataka and neighboring Andhra Pradesh, with a total of over 15000 students. PESU was founded in the year 1988. Prof. M. R. Doreswamy Silver Jubilee Complex (A-Block) Academic profile =Admission criteria= PESU admits 40% of its students to undergraduate courses based on their Karnataka CET and 60% seats based on PESSAT (the university's own entrance test) ranks. PESU also admits students under Management quota, which does not place any merit requirements. There is a lateral entry scheme in place, by which students holding diploma degrees can directly enter the second year of study in engineering. On graduating students receive a Bachelor of Technology degree. Students are admitted to postgraduate courses based on their GATE test scores as well as on their Post Graduate Karnataka CET scores. Upon graduating, they receive a Master of Technology degree. =Course content and grading= All the courses which have been conferred autonomous status have their departments set their own course content and grading system. The college follows the credit-based system of performance evaluation, with proportional weighting of courses based on their importance. The total marks (usually out of 100) form the basis of grades, with a grade value (out of 10) assigned to a range of marks. For each semester, the students are graded by taking a weighted average of all the subject grades with their respective credit points. Each semester's evaluation is done independently with a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) reflecting the overall performance across semesters. Till June 2012, the grading system being followed was relative grading, but the college switched to an absolute grading system after consultations with the university.  Faculty and Research  Crucible Of Research and Innovation (CORI) is a multi-disciplinary research center at PES University. It was inaugurated by Bharat Ratna Dr. C. N. R. Rao (former Director, Indian Institute of Science) on 7 February 2010. It has research facilities and a set of dedicated research staff who carry out research in various areas. Centre for Intelligent Systems (CIS) is a research center at PES University which researches on topics like Control Systems, Speech, Image and Signal Processing, Robotics, Artificial intelligence and Low Power VLSI design. Selected students do internships in Microsoft Innovation Lab in the university campus.  PISAT  On 26 September 2016, PISAT was successfully placed into polar Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO) by India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, in its thirty-seventh flight (PSLV-C35). Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted \\"I applaud the industrious and innovative students of PES University, Bengaluru, for creating the PISAT that was launched successfully today\\". The launch vehicle, carrying multiple satellites including PISAT, lifted off from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh at 9:12 am. PISAT is a 3 - axis stabilized imaging nanosatellite weighing about 5 kgs. and generates 13 watts power with S-band RF communication. The major subsystems are: an imaging camera to provide earth imageries with 80 meter resolution, an On Board Computer (OBC), an Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS), an RF communication system with S Band frequency, telemetry, telecommand, a thermal system and a Structure and Electrical Power System (EPS). The ground software was developed for on-ground orbit determination essential for mission operations.http://www.isro.gov.in/Spacecraft/pisat PISAT was shipped to the Sriharikota Range (SHAR) rocket launch center on 11 September 2016, in the presence of the Director of the ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC), Dr. Mylswamy Annadurai, SSS PD Mr. Amareshwar Khened and other officials. A team of 11 from PES University were present at SHAR for pre-launch activities of PISAT from 11 to 17 September. During the period, PISAT was interfaced with an ejection mechanism and integrated with the launch vehicle. Earlier, after stringent performance and quality tests by an expert committee, the nanosatellite was formally handed over to the ISRO at a function on the campus attended by top officials from the government and ISRO on 20 April 2016.  Rankings The university was ranked in 101-150 band among universities in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2020, in the 151-200 band overall in 2020 and 93 in the engineering ranking in 2020.

The law also requires the United States Department of Justice to write a report on child abuse prevention laws in all U.S. states and territories, \\"with a particular focus on penalties for cases of severe child abuse.\\" The bill was signed into law on May 20, 2014, by President Barack Obama, becoming . Background Kilah Davenport was a little girl who was abused by her stepfather. She was badly beaten in 2012 at age three, suffered severe brain damage, and never recovered, dying in March 2014. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Kilah Davenport Child Protection Act of 2013 directs the Attorney General to report every three years to the congressional judiciary committees on the penalties for violations of laws prohibiting child abuse in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and each U.S. territory, including whether the laws of that jurisdiction provide for enhanced penalties when the victim has suffered serious bodily injury or permanent or protracted loss or impairment of any mental or emotional function. The bill amends the federal criminal code to apply certain increased criminal penalties against any person who commits domestic assault and who has a final conviction on at least two separate prior occasions under state, federal, or tribal court proceedings (a habitual offender) for offenses that would be, if subject to federal jurisdiction, assault, sexual abuse, or a serious violent felony against a spouse or intimate partner (as under current law) or against a child of, or in the care of, the person committing the domestic assault. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on December 4, 2013. This is a public domain source. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 3627 would have no significant cost to the federal government. Enacting the bill could affect direct spending and revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, the CBO estimates that any effects would be insignificant. H.R. 3627 would broaden the coverage of current laws that address domestic assaults by certain repeat offenders. As a result, the government might be able to pursue cases that it otherwise would not be able to prosecute. The CBO expects that the bill would apply to a relatively small number of offenders, however, so any increase in costs for law enforcement, court proceedings, or prison operations would not be significant. Any such costs would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Because those prosecuted and convicted under H.R. 3627 could be subject to criminal fines, the federal government might collect additional fines if the legislation is enacted. Criminal fines are recorded as revenues, deposited in the Crime Victims Fund, and later spent. The CBO expects that any additional revenues and direct spending would not be significant because of the small number of cases likely to be affected. H.R. 3627 also would require the Department of Justice (DOJ) to prepare a report, within 180 days of the bill‚Äôs enactment and again three years after enactment, on the penalties for child abuse in states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Based on the costs of similar activities currently carried out by DOJ, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 3627 would not have a significant effect on spending by the department. H.R. 3627 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.

Monte Baranta Archaeologists divide the Monte Claro culture into four facies: Sassari, Nuoro, Campidano Oristanese.

It originally ran from 2 March to 5 June 1964 with Alistair McHarg as host. It was revived from 30 November 1992 to 26 February 1993 with Richard Wilkins as host. Format According to the host, the aim of the game was for \\"two teams of players (one colored pink and are the champions, the other colored blue and are the challengers), to try to put the right words in the right songs and see how well they can follow the bouncing ball to solve our puzzle song.\\" =First three rounds= A series of nine squares are presented - with each square hiding a note in a \\"familiar\\" tune. The host gives the contestants notes 1, 5, and 9 in all 3 rounds; note 7 was usually added as well in round 3. A member of each team (which consists of three players each) joins the host at the central podium, where they have three coloured buttons (red, blue & yellow) each. A card is randomly selected from the host, which represents the note which is set to be revealed. Three words attached to that number are provided which could represent the next word in a given tune. The contestant who is the quickest to select the correct word after hearing the start of this tune is given the note represented by that selected card. If neither contestant is able to select the correct word, the note goes in as a blank and two new players are brought up to play for two keynotes (and so on). The team that the winning representative came from then has the opportunity to guess the main tune by listening to the already-revealed notes and following the rhythm of the bouncing ball. If the team can correctly name that tune, they win the round and receive a cash prize which doubles for each round. If not, the round continues, rotating through the various members of both teams. If neither of the teams can work out the song before all nine notes are revealed - then the prize for that round is lost and the players go on to the next round. The cash values for correctly identifying the song in the first three rounds are $300 in round 1, $600 in round 2, and $1,200 in round 3, with a maximum possible total of $2,100. The team with the most money at the end of the game wins the game and goes on to play for double their main game cash winnings. =Bonus round= The winning team attempts to win double their cash winnings in prizes from the first three rounds. The team must attempt to uncover the nine notes of the final tune over the course of 30 seconds, by using a buzzer to stop a random flashing light in order to choose a note, and then picking the correct next word, as in the first three rounds. However, the final tune is only played once, at the end of the 30 seconds. If any of the questions representing the notes are not answered correctly within the time limit, they will not be revealed in the playing of the final tune. If the team can correctly identify the final tune, they win double the money in prizes. Champions can stay on the program for up to five shows, and if they succeed in surviving those five shows, they also win a holiday. The maximum possible winnings in total is therefore $4,200 per show, and a team retires after 5 shows with a maximum amount of $21,000 plus the holiday.

Produced in a joint venture with Navistar International, (known as Blue Diamond, a nod to the Ford \\"Blue\\" Oval and the Navistar \\"Diamond\\") the LCF (and its International CF/CityStar counterpart) were manufactured in the same facility in General Escobedo, Mexico that produced the Ford F-650/750 Super Duty conventionals. The cab used came from the Mazda Titan. The first cab-over vehicle sold by Ford since the sale of the US rights to the Ford Cargo design to Freightliner in 1996, they competed primarily against the Isuzu NPR and its rebadged Chevrolet/GMC variants (along with the Mitsubishi Fuso FE). Sold in various wheelbases, it has been used in various configurations, including dump trucks, fire trucks, tow trucks, box trucks, crane/bucket trucks, flat beds and stake bodies.  Design  4th-generation Mazda Titan, source of the cab for the Ford LCF and International CF/Citystar = Chassis = The chassis was mostly based on existing F-Series architecture. The cab was derived from the Japanese Mazda Titan introduced in 2000. Standard features included manual windows and steel wheels and a painted grille; for an extra cost, power windows could be added alongside a chrome grille, bumper, and wheels. Styled similar to the Super Duty trucks, the grille of the LCF differed from its International counterpart, which featured vertical bars. = Powertrain = The LCF and CF were fitted with a single powertrain: a 4.5-litre V6 version of the 6-litre PowerStroke/VT365. While the engine itself was exclusive to the two trucks, it was mated to the five-speed Torqshift (5R110W) transmission shared with the Super Duty pickup line.  Reception  It was widely criticized for its noisy engine, fuel consumption, lack of head and foot room (due to the placement of the steering column), and a dealer network that was uneducated on the product. The trucks many times sat, unsold, for several years. Production came to an end in 2009 along with the Ford-Navistar relationship, and Ford divested itself of Blue Diamond.

Series overview As with the previous seven TV movies, the series continues the spirited life of newly widowed Cassie Nightingale, the good-hearted enchantress of the fictional Middleton, United States, with her now-teenage daughter Grace. When new neighbors, the Radfords, move in next door, they become suspicious of Cassie and her daughter. The dynamics of the series' focus would change during the six seasons, which later saw the Nightingales and Radfords become more friendlier and romantic, leading up to Cassie's marrying for the second time, while at the same time shifted to stories involving its residents (including their relationships with others), an ongoing mystery and a series of curses that is tied to Cassie's family lineage. Cast =Main= *Catherine Bell as Cassandra \\"Cassie\\" Nightingale: She is the owner of a shop called Bell, Book & Candle and runs a bed and breakfast at Grey House.

R. R. Tolkien. It began informally in 1969, and held its inaugural meeting in 1970. It holds five annual events, namely a Birthday Toast, a Tolkien Reading Day, an AGM and Springmoot, a Seminar, and the Oxonmoot conference-cum- convention. The society publishes a bulletin named Amon Hen, and a journal, Mallorn. It has local groups called \\"smials\\", one of which, the Cambridge Tolkien Society, publishes the open access journal Anor. History In the November 1969 issue of The Middle Earthworm, a letters of comment fanzine mainly aimed at British members of the Tolkien Society of America, Vera Chapman announced \\"if not quite the birth, at least the hopeful conception of a Tolkien Society of Britain\\". This was supplemented by a personal column by Chapman in the New Statesman published on 7 November which ran \\"TOLKIEN SOCIETY of Britain ‚Äî write Belladonna Took [Chapman's pseudonym], c/o Chapman, 21 Harrington House, Stanhope St. London NW1\\". Since this would have hit news- stands a day before publication, the Tolkien Society's informal beginning has been placed at Thursday 6 November 1969. The Tolkien Society gradually took shape over the following years. December 1969 saw the publication of Belladonna's Broadsheet, which after three issues was replaced by The Mallorn in October 1970. This was conceived as a quarterly publication, and the first issue was joined by The Tolkien Society Bulletin, which was to be produced on a six-weekly basis. The Society's official bulletin was replaced in January 1972 with Anduril, but was quickly supplanted by Henneth Ann√ªn after three issues (the first had been numbered 0 and it continued independently until issue number 7). This new publication changed its name to Amon Hen with the second issue, seemingly for no particular reason. It, together with Mallorn (the definite article having being dropped from issue 2), are still published by the Tolkien Society. The \\"inaugural\\" meeting of the Tolkien Society was hosted by the Hobbit Society of University College London (UCL) on 29 January 1970, where the name of the new society was discussed and the first committee was appointed. A constitution was considered at the first general meeting of the Tolkien Society on 20 November 1970 at UCL, but was ultimately rejected. The Tolkien Society did not become a legal entity until a constitution was finally ratified on 15 January 1972. It later obtained charitable status in England and Wales on 7 July 1977. An AGM has been held each year since 1972, and since 1973 has featured a talk from a guest speaker. It is one of the three main annual Tolkien Society events, the largest and most popular being \\"Oxonmoot\\". In the December 1973 issue of the fanzine Nazgul, contributor John Abbot asked, \\"[w]hat do you think of the idea of Oxford Moot this year?\\" The 1974 AGM approved the idea, and the first Oxonmoot met at The Welsh Pony 13‚Äì15 September later that year. The first (near-)annual Tolkien Society \\"workshop\\" was held on 22 March 1986, morphing into the \\"Tolkien Society Seminar\\" from 1989 onward. The more informal \\"Summermoot\\" was held on an irregular basis in the 1980s and 1990s, occasionally hosted by Joanna Tolkien and Hugh Baker at their farm in Wales. According to their son (and Tolkien's great-grandson) Royd Tolkien: The Tolkien Society has also organized a number of major conferences to celebrate significant Tolkienian anniversaries. \\"The J.R.R. Tolkien Centenary Conference\\" at Keble College, Oxford, marked one-hundred years since Tolkien's birth in 1992. \\"Tolkien 2005: The Ring Goes Ever On\\" celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of The Lord of the Rings at Aston University, Birmingham. \\"The Return of the Ring: Celebrating Tolkien in 2012\\" marked seventy-five years since the publication of The Hobbit at Loughborough University, and received a special video message from director Peter Jackson and artists John Howe and Alan Lee. Contact with J. R. R. Tolkien Vera Chapman first contacted J. R. R. Tolkien on behalf of the Tolkien Society upon the suggestion of Joy Hill, Tolkien's secretary during the 1960s. On 1 May 1970 she wrote Tolkien a letter introducing the Society and its aims. Later, following the announcement that Tolkien had been awarded a CBE in the New Year's Honours, the Society sent Tolkien a telegram on his eightieth birthday on 3 January 1972. The Society also sent him a gift of tobacco in a green china jar, along with a congratulatory note. That evening, Joy Hill telephoned Chapman to say that \\"[o]f all the tributes he [Tolkien] received, this was the one that gave the greatest pleasure. There was a chance he might write personally.\\" And, on 6 February, he did: Later that year, Chapman met Tolkien in person. On 27 June, she was invited to a sherry party hosted by Tolkien's publishing firm George Allen & Unwin. During their brief exchange, she asked Tolkien if he would consent to become the Society's honorary president. \\"Certainly\\", he responded, \\"[i]f I can help your society in any way, I will.\\" Tolkien died the following year. Upon offering the presidency to Christopher Tolkien, he wrote back suggesting that his father could remain president in perpetuity. This was agreed at the following Annual General Meeting held at the Ivanhoe Hotel in London on 16 February 1974. Activities =Events= The Tolkien Society currently organizes five events on an annual basis: * The Birthday Toast is held on Tolkien's birthday on 3 January. The Society asks fans across the world to raise a toast to \\"The Professor\\" at 9pm their local time. Many local groups (or \\"smials\\") hold their own Birthday Toast events. In recent years the event has become social media orientated, with fans sharing pictures of themselves raising a toast to Tolkien on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. * Tolkien Reading Day is held on the anniversary of the downfall of Sauron on 25 March. It aims to promote the reading of Tolkien- based around a particular theme chosen each year by the Tolkien Society committee. The idea was first proposed to the Society by Sean Kirst, a journalist at the Syracuse, New York The Post-Standard, in 2002 and the first Tolkien Reading Day was set for 25 March 2003. * The AGM and Springmoot is held over a weekend in April. Although the Annual General Meeting is the main aspect of the event, the weekend also includes the semi-formal Annual Dinner followed by a talk from a guest speaker. As the AGM and Springmoot changes location each year, it is an opportunity for members to spend the rest of the weekend exploring local attraction sites. * The Tolkien Society Seminar is a day-long event held over the summer, consisting of a series of papers on a selected theme. * Oxonmoot is held on a weekend near to Bilbo and Frodo's birthday on 22 September. It is a conference-cum-convention held in an Oxford college since 1991. With around 200 attendees, it features academic lectures, quizzes, costuming, and a memorial service at Tolkien's grave in Wolvercote cemetery. =Publications= The cover of Mallorn 12 (1978) featuring an illustration by Pauline Baynes Membership of the Tolkien Society includes a subscription to the bulletin Amon Hen and journal Mallorn. The former is published six times a year, while the latter is published once a year. Mallorn tends to be more scholarly than Amon Hen, although the range of content has varied over the years. Prominent contributors include Christopher Tolkien, Priscilla Tolkien, and Tom Shippey. Quettar was the bulletin of the Linguistic Fellowship of The Tolkien Society between 1980 and 1995, running for forty- nine issues before being wound up. The Tolkien Society has also published a number of one-off publications, including the proceedings of the 1992 and 2005 conferences. Its \\"Peter Roe\\" series of books are published irregularly, and tend to print proceedings of seminars and talks by guest speakers. =Local groups= Local groups affiliated to the Tolkien Society are known as \\"smials\\", the name used for hobbit-holes in The Lord of the Rings. One smial at the University of Cambridge, known as the \\"Cambridge Tolkien Society\\" and \\"Minas Tirith\\", has published the open access journal Anor since the 1980s. =Tolkien to the World= The Tolkien to the World programme raises funds to send Tolkien books to schools and libraries across the world. Its aim is \\"to work towards a situation where everyone in the world has access to Tolkien‚Äôs principal works of fiction\\". =Archive= The Tolkien Society Archive maintains a large number of Tolkien books and journals together with a collection of ephemera such a press clippings and responses (both commercial and creative) to Tolkien which might not otherwise be preserved. =Plaques and memorials= The Tolkien Society has funded blue plaques at places of significance in Tolkien's life. These include: * Sarehole Mill in Birmingham, a location adjacent to one of Tolkien's childhood homes and the inspiration behind Ted Sandyman's mill in The Lord of the Rings. In 2015, the Tolkien Society and Birmingham Museums Trust announced a partnership to promote Sarehole Mill and its connection to Tolkien. * 4 Highfield Road in Birmingham, Tolkien's home between January 1910 and Autumn 1911. * The Plough and Harrow Hotel in Birmingham, where Tolkien stayed with his new wife Edith on 3 June 1916 shortly before leaving for war service in France. * 2 Darnley Road in Leeds, the Tolkien family home between 17 March 1924 and 4 January 1926. The 1992 Centenary Conference, organized by the Tolkien Society and the Mythopoeic Society, sponsored a memorial to Tolkien in Oxford University Parks. This involved the installation of a bench with an accompanying plaque and the planting of two trees representing Telperion and Laurelin from The Silmarillion. =Awards= The Tolkien Society Awards were established in 2014 to \\"recognise excellence in the fields of Tolkien scholarship and fandom\\". The awards are held annually and are announced at the Annual Dinner during the Society's AGM and Springmoot weekend. Past winners include authors Christopher Tolkien, Tom Shippey, Dimitra Fimi, John Garth, and artist Jenny Dolfen.

History The Court of Chancery was the court with jurisdiction in cases of equity between 1836 and 1847, presided over by a Chancellor. In certain cases, appeal could be made to the Michigan Supreme Court. The law creating the Court of Chancery took effect July 4, 1836 and it was abolished on March 1, 1847, with its jurisdiction given to the circuit courts. The Recorder's Court was a state court of limited jurisdiction which had, for most of its history, exclusive jurisdiction over traffic and ordinance matters and all felony cases committed in Detroit. Its jurisdiction did not extend to civil suits. It was merged into the Wayne County Circuit Court following the pattern of the rest of the state of Michigan in October 1997.

BYOOS has been made possible thanks to the ability to create USB pen drives and other external storage devices with 'live' operating system images containing all the necessary drivers to allow boot up and operation on any compatible computer. Bootable versions of Linux were available by 1993. In 2012, Microsoft Windows 8 Enterprise Edition followed, by introduced 'Windows to go' functionality to allow the operating system to boot and run from mass storage devices such as USB flash drives thus enabling BYOOS in the Windows family of operating system similar to that of a Linux live CD/DVD. By allowing users to bring their own operating system there are significant cost savings to be made by organisations who commonly have many on-site users and are obliged to provide them with computer hardware to allow them to perform specific tasks as there is no longer a need to install a hard drive in each computer. Upgrading and maintaining many PC computers has also become easier as companies only need to supply users with new pen drives containing the operating system boot images rather than having to re-image every PC with the latest build of the operating system thus eliminating upgrade costs. As users can take the USB devices containing their version of the operating system around with them employees can boot up their home computer with the same USB stick so it has exactly the same software environment as they use in their place of work thus enabling employees to work at home exactly the same as they would in the office. The introduction of cloud based storage, means portable operating systems are free of the need to store data locally. The unbundling of the office application data and other user data from the drives containing the operating systems has been a key factor in making BYOOS possible.

The Bernardo fire was the second of the May 2014 wildfires in San Diego County, and the first of the swarm of wildfires that ignited in mid-May, following dry weather and Santa Ana conditions. The fire ignited in 4S Ranch in San Diego County, on May 13, near Del Norte High School, and eventually spread southward and westward, burning of land. The Bernardo Fire was extinguished on May 17, without causing any significant property losses. The fire The fire started on Tuesday, May 13, at 10:00 AM PDT, just south of Del Norte High School, in a construction trench off Nighthawk Lane. Over the next few hours, the wildfire intensified, due to the strong Santa Ana winds driving it southward. This prompted the evacuation of several schools (with the exception of Del Norte High School), in addition to at least 20,000 homes. Within several hours, the fire covered at least and was only 5% contained. The rapid southward spread of the fire caused mandatory evacuation orders to be issued for portions of 4S Ranch, Del Sur, Black Mountain Ranch, Rancho Santa Fe, and other residential communities. Late on May 13, the Bernardo Fire reached a size of . By 12:00 AM PDT on May 14, the portion of the fire within 4S Ranch and Del Sur had been completely extinguished, which was about 25% of the Bernardo Fire's 1,600 acre blaze. Later on May 14, all of the evacuation orders were lifted. On Wednesday, May 14, at 6 PM PDT, the wildfire was 50% contained. By the next morning, it was reported as 75% contained and no longer expanding. On May 16, the Bernardo Fire was reported to be 90% contained, but some structures were still threatened by the fire. On May 17, the fire was 95% contained, without having expanded any further. On May 17, at 8:14 PM PDT, the Bernardo Fire was reported to be 100% contained. The San Diego Unified School District closed all its schools citywide on May 15, but reopened most of them on the following day. The cause of the Bernardo Fire has been ruled to be accidental; authorities said that it started in a small trench being dug by a construction crew and spread rapidly through the dry brush at the site. The Bernardo Fire had been ignited by sparks coming from a backhoe trencher.

The Wesleyan Methodist Church was formed in 1843 as a voice of opposition to slavery views held by the Methodist Episcopal Church. However, over time, the Wesleyan Methodist Church also began to make changes that prompted a further separation by those who chose to call themselves the Bible Methodist Connection of Tennessee. The Bible Methodist Connection of Tennessee today aligns itself in many ways with the Conservative Holiness Movement. History, 1968 to Present =Formation of the Connection= The Bible Methodist Connection of Tennessee was formed over what many believed was a liberalization of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. \\"Holiness as a doctrine still adorned the pages of its Book of Discipline, but holiness in practice and true holiness standards became a very rare thing.\\"1 Also there was disagreement concerning the organization of the denomination. Those who sided with the Wesleyan Methodist Church wished to have a strong, centralized government while those who eventually broke away and formed the Tennessee connection favored a loose \\"connection\\" of like minded churches. D.P. Denton and his conservative sympathizers met in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1966 to discuss the formation of a new connection with more individual church autonomy. \\"The new group would continue the use of Wesleyan Methodist Discipline...with the exception that each church would be completely autonomous.\\" 2 \\"When the General Leaders of the Wesleyan Methodist Church entered into a number of lawsuits against Conferences and Local Churches of their own denomination, the Tennessee Conference (chartered by the State of Tennessee) had no choice but to withdraw its fellowship from the denomination.\\"3 Following a series of Conference Meetings, the reorganization became final on May 4, 1968. The officers of the reorganized Connection were: * D.P. Denton, President * W.G. Harwell, Vice President * Mary Jane Biddle, Secretary * Carl Johnson, Treasurer \\"The Board of Managers was so composed that each section of the Connection had representation and no one group could become dominant.\\" In March 1987, after 35 years as president, D.P. Denton resigned to form a small group called the Bible Methodist Fellowship. Earl Newton became president. Since Earl Newton retired in 2003, the presidency has been held for shorter time periods by Gerald Wright, Leroy Archibald and Richard Midkiff. Pastor Dale Chapman was elected president of the Connection in 2017. Doctrine The Bible Methodist Connection of Tennessee would be characterized as a conservative evangelical denomination holding to the Wesleyan-Arminian persuasion and believe that the Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God. They believe in the second coming of Jesus Christ, and affirm their faith in the \\"literal creation of man by the immediate creative act of God.\\" They affirm their faith in the doctrine of regeneration, or the \\"new birth\\" by which the sinner becomes a child of God through faith in Jesus Christ. A key affirmation of faith is their belief in the doctrine of entire sanctification by which work of grace the heart is cleansed by the Holy Spirit from all inbred sin through faith in Jesus when the believer presents himself a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God and is enabled through grace to love God with all his heart and to walk in His heart and to walk In His heart and to walk in His holy commandments blameless. By the act of cleansing it is to be interpreted and taught by the ministry and teachers that is not a ‚Äúsuppression‚Äù or a ‚Äúcounteraction‚Äù of ‚Äúliberated sin‚Äù so as to ‚Äúmake it imperative‚Äù, but to ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù or ‚Äúto eradicate‚Äù from the heart so that the believer not only has a right to heaven, but is so conformed to God‚Äôs nature that he will enjoy God and heaven forever. These terms are what we hold that that cleansing from all sin implies.5 Missions and Camps Bible Methodist Missions have been primarily represented in New Mexico and Mexico. In 1983, Din√© Mission was founded by Don and Nona Phoebus in Gallup, New Mexico. The Connection has actively supported this mission since its founding. The annual connectional camp meeting and conference are held in Knoxville, Tennessee at the connectional campgrounds. Another Bible Methodist Camp, Salisbury Bible Methodist Camp, has also been held for many years in Salisbury, North Carolina. Commonly mistaken identity The Bible Methodist Connection of Tennessee is commonly mistaken to be part of or associated with the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches. However, although they share many similar characteristics, the two groups have never had any mutual association. Both groups separated from the Wesleyan Methodist Connection as individual entities. Growth of the Connection There are currently eighteen churches in six states and one foreign country (Tennessee, North Carolina, Ohio, Arkansas, Virginia, New Mexico, and Mexico.)
