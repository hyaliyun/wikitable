Long argued as to whether or not it is a subspecies, the Apalachicola kingsnake was formerly named Lampropeltis getula goini. After years of research and many more specimens examined, in 2006 it was renamed to Lampropeltis getula meansi after D. Bruce Means, in recognition of his work on this subspecies. Description Adults can range from 30 to 56.1 inches. They are characterized by variable coloration patterns with an overall light dorsal coloration and wide or thin banding patterns. However, some striped and patternless specimens have also been identified. The ventral pattern is also variable; some with bicolored, loose checkerboard, or predominantly dark scales. They possess smooth scales and have 21 dorsal scale rows at mid-body. Geographic range The Apalachicola Lowlands kingsnake is endemic to Florida, and is only found in the panhandle between the Apalachicola River and Ochlokonee River and south of Telogia Creek. Morphological intermediates are found on both northern and southern ends of the range. These intermediates represent interbreeding between the Apalachicola kingsnake (L. g. meansi) and the eastern kingsnake (L. g getula). Habitat Suitable habitat varies, however their range is quite small. The Apalachicola kingsnake's habitat includes pinelands, hardwood hammocks, cypress strands, prairies, marshes, and estuaries. Diet Their diet includes snakes, even venomous ones such as the rattlesnake, lizards, amphibians, rodents, birds, and turtle and bird eggs. Reproduction Like other kingsnakes, they are oviparous, or egg-laying. Breeding takes place in March, April and May, and after a month approximately 3 to 30 eggs are laid. The eggs hatch in late summer, 65 to 70 days after they have been laid. The hatchlings have an enormous appetite and grow quickly.

The camp is located outside the Israeli West Bank barrier (unlike most other Jerusalem's neighborhoods), but technically the Shuafat refugee camp is the only Palestinian refugee camp located inside Jerusalem or any other Israeli-administered area. Shuafat refugee camp In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Red Cross accommodated Palestinian refugees in the depopulated and partly destroyed Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem. This grew into the Muaska refugee camp managed by UNRWA, which housed refugees from 48 locations now in Israel. Over time many poor non-refugees also settled in the camp. Conditions became unsafe for habitation due to lack of maintenance and sanitation, but neither UNRWA nor the Jordanian government wanted the negative international response that would result if they demolished the old Jewish houses.304x304pxIn 1964, a decision was made to move the refugees to a new camp constructed on mostly Jewish land near Shuafat. Most of the refugees refused to move, since it would mean losing their livelihood, the market and the tourists, as well as reducing their access to the holy sites. In the end, many of the refugees were moved to Shuafat by force during 1965 and 1966. History Shuafat refugee camp After the 1967 Six-Day War, East Jerusalem, including the town and refugee camp, was occupied and later annexed by Israel, in a move not internationally recognized, and were incorporated into the Jerusalem municipal district.Noah Browning, 'In bleak Arab hinterland, hints of Jerusalem's partition,' Reuters December 20, 2013. The residents were offered Israeli citizenship, but most refused it as they considered the area to be illegally occupied. Many accepted permanent residency status instead. The Shuafat refugee camp is the only Palestinian refugee camp located inside Jerusalem or any other Israeli- administered area. While its residents carry Jerusalem identity cards, which grants them the same privileges and rights as regular Israelis, the camp itself is largely serviced by UNRWA, even though 40-50% of the camp's population are not registered refugees. The Israeli West Bank barrier was partially constructed between the camp and the rest of Shuafat and Jerusalem. Some health services are provided by Israeli clinics in the camp. The Israeli presence is limited to checkpoints controlling entry and exit. According to Ir Amim, the camp suffers from high crime because Israeli Police rarely enter due to security concerns, while the Palestinian Civil Police Force does not operate in Israeli-administered municipalities. Unlike other UN-run refugee camps, residents of Shuafat camp pay taxes to the Israeli authorities. In a survey conducted as part of the research for the book Negotiating Jerusalem (2000), it was reported that 59% of Israeli Jews supported redefining the borders of the city of Jerusalem so as to exclude Arab settlements such as Shuafat, in order to ensure a \\"Jewish majority\\" in Jerusalem. In July 2001, the Israeli authorities destroyed 14 homes under construction in Shuafat on the orders of then mayor Ehud Olmert, who said the structures were built without permits. No one was yet living in them.Violence flares in Jerusalem as Israeli bulldozers destroy dozen 'illegal' homes The families acknowledged they do not own the land they built on, but believed they had permission to build there from Islamic Trust religious authorities and argue that obtaining permits to build legally is nearly impossible. Olmert said the houses were being constructed on public land in a \\"green area\\" and posed a security threat to the Jews of Pisgat Ze'ev. According to Isabel Kershner of the New York Times, Shuafat suffered from an absence of municipal planning, overcrowding, and potholed roads in 2007. As prime minister, Ehud Olmert questioned whether the annexation of areas like Shuafat into the Jerusalem area was necessary. The Israeli initiative to transfer control of the area to the Palestinian National Authority led to a split in the community: a camp official favored being under Palestinian sovereignty, while the neighborhood's mukhtar rejected the plan, citing his residents' participation in Israeli elections as well as the danger of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel =Urban development= In 2012, Sorbonne scholar professor Sylvaine Bulle cited the Shuafat refugee camp for its urban renewal dynamic, seeing it as an example of a creative adaptation to the fragmented space of the camps towards creating a bricolage city, with businesses relocating from east Jerusalem there and new investment in commercial projects.

Life  Giovanni Battista Audiffredi entered the Dominican Order, and soon attracted attention by his taste for books and his talent for the exact sciences. After being occupied in various houses as professor and bibliographer, he was at length transferred to the College of St. Thomas at the Dominican convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, the future Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. He was placed in charge (1765) of the Bibliotheca Casanatensis, founded in 1700 by Cardinal Girolamo Casanata.  Works  Audiffredi published a bibliographical work in four folio, volumes entitled \\"Bibliotheca Casanatensis librorum typis impressorum, 1761–1790\\". The work remains unfinished, not proceeding beyond the letter L, and contains a list of his own publications. Similar works were the \\"Catalogus historico-criticus Romanarum editionum saeculi XV\\" (Rome, 1785, quarto), and the more extensively planned \\"Catalogus historico-criticus editionum Italicarum saeculi XV\\" (ibid., 1794,), which was to give an account of books printed in twenty-six Italian cities. Audiffredi did not live to complete the work. The first part, extending to the letter G, contains a short biography of the author introduced by the publisher. Audiffredi's position enabled him to become an expert antiquarian, and he found time to cultivate his mathematical talent and to devote himself to astronomy. He built a small observatory, and at intervals busied himself with observation. The eighteenth century was much occupied with the problem of solar parallax. In 1761 and 1769 the transit of Venus were observed, and Audiffredi contributed to the work in his publication, \\"Phaenomena coelestia observata—investigatio parallaxis solis. Exercitatio Dadei Ruffi\\" (anagram for Audiffredi). Alexandre Guy Pingré's subsequent discounting of Audifreddi's observations led to a scientific dispute. The predicted reappearance in the middle of the century of Halley's comet intensified scientific interest in cometic orbits. The epoch was favored with a number of brilliant objects of this kind, and that of 1769 distinguished itself by its great nucleus and by the tail which stretched over more than half the sky. Audiffredi took observations of the positions of the comet and published his results under the title, \\"Dimostrazione della stazione della cometa, 1769\\" (1770).

History The station was opened as Carnock Road in July 1852 on the Alloa Branch of the Scottish Central Railway, the branch had opened two years earlier in 1850. The station was sited about from the village and was located in Stirling. Originally the station was at a level crossing, there was a single platform on a single line of railway with a siding to the south. The OS map has the station named as Carnock Station. In 1865 the station was renamed Airth Road and it was again renamed as Airth in 1866. One of the agreements made between the Caledonian Railway (CR) and the North British Railway prior to the Alloa Railway opening in 1885 was to double track the remainder of the Alloa Branch to accommodate the increased traffic that would result from the bridge over the Forth. When the line was double-tracked the station was rebuilt, the road now formed an overbridge and the station was relocated to the south of the road, there were two platforms connected by a footbridge either side of a double running line, and a siding to the east, and a signal box to the south. By 1915, a goods shed and several sidings had been added. The goods yard was able to accommodate most types of goods including live stock and was equipped with a two ton crane. The station closed on 20 September 1954.

It was the last of his works to be published within his lifetime. Plot introduction This is a novel about the source of a mysterious 40 million pound legacy. The main benefactor of Jan Willem Hendryk's legacy was 34 million to a small agricultural college in the remote Rift Valley in Kenya, with the remaining six million to be split between his only known descendants. One descendant is the South African Dirk Hendricks, the new husband of security consultant Max Stafford's friend Alix. The other is the recently discovered Henry Hendrix, a young California beach bum, who is tracked down by down-on-his-luck private detective Ben Hardin. However, a strange series of events involving the attempted murder of Henry Hendrix, and a stranger masquerading as Henry in England lead Hardin to seek help from Stafford. Stafford, for his own reasons, is interested in this mysterious windfall, and the strange clause in the will stating that the heirs must spend one month of every year in Kenya. Suspicious that the man claiming to be Henry Hendrix is an imposter and that the college is not what it seems leads Max Stafford to visit Kenya. The violent reaction to his arrival in Kenya points to a sinister and far-reaching conspiracy far beyond mere greed.

Location Pfaffenschneide, Rock at the southern slope of Glockenkarkopf and Pfaffenschneidkopf, near the former Lausitz Refuge The ridgeline of Glockenkarkopf forms the international border extending between two mountain passes, Krimmler Tauern in the west and Birnlücke (Forcella del Picco) in the east. Nearby summits include Tauernkopf (2874 m above mean sea level) to the west, and to the southwest the higher Pfaffenschneidkopf (2918 m), from which the Pfaffenschneid slopes (strikes) southward. This slope is crossed by the Lausitz path at the Teufelsstiege (Devil's Stair). Political history and toponymy In 1896 the mountain, then belonging to Austria-Hungary, was mentioned in the journal of the Österreichischer Alpenverein. The summit was reached for the first time in 1895 by Franz Hofer and Fritz Kögl., page 318 On 16 July 1904 the Italian nationalist, irredentist, and later fascist Ettore Tolomei climbed the mountain, proclaimed himself the first to reach its summit, asserted that it was the northernmost point of the Adriatic Sea's drainage basin and thus belonged to Italy, and named it \\"Vetta d'Italia\\" (\\"Peak of Italy\\"). However, the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919) defines the northernmost point of Italy as the summit not of Glockenkarkopf, but of nearby (2841 m), which is slightly farther north and is in fact the northernmost point of the Adriatic Sea's drainage basin. Tolomei's name is used in Italian maps from 1905 onward. Austrian nobleman and political theorist Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn wrote that United States president Woodrow Wilson was poorly knowledgeable about European geography and history, and that the name \\"Vetta d'Italia\\" convinced him of the legitimacy of Italy's claim to the region., page 205 Besides the name \\"Vetta d'Italia\\", which is widely rejected by the German-speaking population of South Tyrol, local researchers on the toponymy of village names argue that \\"Klockerkarkopf\\" (not Glockenkarkopf) is the older and correct name, being derived from the name \\"Klockeralm\\".

He is best known for his role as chairman of the Ngāi Tahu Māori Trust Board which he guided to successful land and sea fisheries claims before the Waitangi Tribunal, culminating in the Tribunal's reports of 1991 and 1992. He later led claim settlement negotiations leading to the 1998 settlement which made extensive provision for customary rights in fisheries and other natural resources. In 1974 he stood alongside his father Rolland on the Labour Party ticket for the Wellington Harbour Board, however despite polling well he was unsuccessful in winning a seat. In the 1994 Queen's Birthday Honours, O'Regan was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for services to the Māori people and the community. =Later activities= Bronze bust of O'Regan as part of the Twelve Local Heroes sculptureO'Regan is currently associate lecturer and assistant vice chancellor (Māori) at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, associated with both the history and Māori departments.

In March 2009, O'Regan was commemorated as one of the Twelve Local Heroes of Christchurch, and a bronze bust of him was unveiled outside the Christchurch Arts Centre. He is a director of Milford Dart Ltd, a company which proposed a tunnel through the Southern Alps to more than halve the time taken to negotiate the road between resort centres Queenstown and Milford Sound. The proposal had Department of Conservation approval but there was opposition because the tunnel would be in a National Park and UNESCO World heritage area. O'Regan argued the \\"absurdity of spending over 11 hours in a day to go to Milford from Queenstown\\", but in July 2013, the Minister of Conservation, Nick Smith, declined the proposal because of significant environmental impacts. O'Regan was a member of the New Zealand Geographic Board from 1985 to 2013, and from 2010 he has co-chaired the Constitutional Advisory Panel, which is seeking public input on constitutional reform in New Zealand.

Pasini studied at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome and made her professional opera debut in that city at the Teatro Quirino as Inez in Meyerbeer's L'Africaine. She most notably originated the role of Musetta in the original 1896 production of Puccini's La bohème at the Teatro Regio in Turin. She also sang that role at numerous other theaters including La Scala, the Teatro Costanzi in Rome, and in Brescia, Genoa, Trieste, and Asti among others. In 1904, Pasini traveled to South America where she performed on tour in many countries and cities. In 1905, Pasini married a lawyer with the surname of Muzi and promptly gave up her career for the next six years. She returned to the stage in 1911 in the premiere of the opera La Vigilia di Notte by Teofilo De Angelis at the Teatro Costanzi. She retired from the operatic stage somewhere around 1920. Pasini spent almost her entire career in Italy. She performed in most of Italy's major opera houses including the Teatro Rossetti in Trieste, at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, and at the Teatro Comunale Fiume in Padua, Cremona, Milan and Rome.

Built in 1916, it was home to Sam Rayburn (1882-1961), a famously effective Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and Since 1972, it has been operated as a museum and state historic site by the Texas Historical Commission. Description and history The Sam Rayburn House is located on about on the south side of Texas Highway 56, on the western outskirts of Bonham. The property includes the main house, a storage building, shed, garage, wellhouse, and barn. The main house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is protected by a shed-roof portico with two-story Tuscan columns, and there are three gabled dormers projecting from the roof. The facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance framed by sidelight and transom windows, topped by a projecting cornice. The house was originally thought to be built around 1904, before the Rayburn family purchased the property. Subsequent research later determined the date to be 1916, since Sam Rayburn's brother Tom took a lien on the property without the house on it. As originally built, the house was smaller and had a hip roof; its present configuration is the result of a major expansion commissioned by Rayburn from Dallas architect W.B. Yarborough. Rayburn occupied the house until his death in 1961. Since he died divorced and childless, his sister lived there until her death in 1969, after which it was taken over by the Sam Rayburn Foundation. In 1972, the foundation turned most of the property (excepting only the barn) to the state for preservation. All the furnishings are original and remain as they were when the Rayburns lived there. Rayburn's 1947 Cadillac is also on site.MuseumsUSA: Sam Rayburn House Museum Rayburn was one of the most influential Congressmen of the first half of the 20th century, serving for 17 years as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. He was an important force in maintaining harmony between the northern and southern wings of the Democratic Party, and served as a mentor to future president Lyndon B. Johnson. Of three residences known to be associated with Rayburn, this one is the best preserved and most evocative of his life.

The Taupo seat was a marginal one and the women's section of the National Party raised a large sum of money to ensure her re-election. Also in 1966 she also called for the names of women in 'so-called rape cases' to have their names published on the grounds that they may have been provocative, a move that may not have gained her support from women voters. Stevenson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the community, in the 1976 Queen's Birthday Honours.

Construction started by the North Eastern Railway in 1884, and the line opened to freight between Cornhill and on 2 May 1887, and the whole line for both freight and passengers on 5 September of the same year.

Bob (Gene Bervoets) is a film critic from the Netherlands who loves and understands the movies but doesn't have the same knack with the real world, especially the opposite sex. Bob is deeply infatuated with a woman (Sylvia Hoeks) who works at the popcorn counter of his favorite movie theater, but while she sometimes flirts with him, he's too nervous to follow through. Bob decides he needs to be more bold if he wants to win his dream girl, but just as he's gathering his courage to lure her back to his apartment, he suddenly finds himself entertaining an unexpected guest.

Freiherr is a German title of nobility. Situated between a Ritter (Chevalier) and a Graf (Comte), its modern equivalent is Baron. Blomberg is a German city in the middle of North Rhine- Westphalia, with Detmold as its capital, founded between 1231 and 1255. History The Freiherr von Blomberg family was typically based around North- Rhine-Westfalia and Lower Saxony, though Bavarian extensions are frequent. During the centuries the Family line spread throughout Eastern Europe from the Baltic sea through to Romania. The first von Blomberg of prominence was Heinrich Ulrich Freiherr von Blomberg (1745-1813). Of the Bavarian branch, one member of the family (diametrically opposed to Heinrich Ulrich) was a devout Protestant, Friedrich Freiherr von Blomberg. His lineage can be traced to Strengberg, a town in Amstetten in Lower Austria. Little more than the following details of him are known: quoted from contemporary archival sources “in a church, in the chapel under the north façade, we can find an altar- painting of the Holy Nicolaus, patron-saint of the boatsmen. Originally, it hung in the chapel of the Schloss Achleiten. This chapel was entirely demolished in 1836, when the Schloss became the property of the protestant Friedrich Freiherr von Blomberg”. Wilhelm Freiherr von Blomberg (1788-1846) The Lippische Landesbibliothek Detmold holds all Prussian scientific and military archives of the time. We can consult the writings of the Offizier and Schriftsteller (Chroniqer) Wilhelm Freiherr von Blomberg. He went to the military academy and became a Major in the army; his main task, however, was that of chronicler. In those military times, his job was to write about all things regarding military life: how much was paid, what manoeuvres had what result, who was disciplined, as well as writing uplifting poems. In 1811, he was summoned to move from his casern situated in Lemgo to Bremen where Napoleon had just started what turned out to be his last campaign. (note: it may be of interest that the town of Lemgo witnessed a great amount of witch trials between 1667 and 1683). This was followed by another move in 1814 to do the same in Hamburg, for the same reason – both cities shortly were part of the French Empire until the Battle of Waterloo turned them German again. He stayed in Hamburg until 1842. In 1842, about a quarter of the inner city was destroyed in the \\"Great Fire\\". This fire started on the night of the 4 May 1842 and was extinguished on 8 May. It destroyed three churches, the town hall, and countless other buildings. It killed 51 people, and left an estimated 20,000 homeless. Reconstruction took more than 40 years. The von Blomberg house was one of them: it was destroyed entirely, together with all its possessions and family archives. A broken man, he and his wife, Nina, and son moved to Lübeck in 1842 where, never having recovered from this tragedy, he remained until his death in 1846. His brother, Karl Alexander Freiherr von Blomberg (1886-1813), was equally an officer and chronicler, who died in Berlin in 1813. Ernst Freiherr von Blomberg (1821-1903) Born in Hamburg, the son of Wilhelm Freiherr von Blomberg, Ernst attended the Academisches Gymnasium where he studied Evangelic Theology and subsequently enrolled the University to study Biology. He resurfaced in 1856 when he was appointed Lektor at the Fachhochschule Lübeck. He held the chair of the department of Zoology. In 1869, he published Die Verwandlung im Prinzipus: Thiere, Maenschen und Ihren Gottlosen Vereinen, which covered such topics as clinical lycanthropy and clinical vampirism, it is considered the first attempt in describing anthrozoology. In 1914, Springer Berlin/Heidelberg published the paper “Ein seltener fall von Hydrocephalus” (A Rare Case of Hydrocephalus), by Dr. Freiherr v. Blomberg, in the ‘Zeitschrift für die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie’. Although some online efforts have attempted to link this document to interests in vampirism, the paper is an observation-driven medical account of a child (known as C.K.) with hydrocephaly, commenting on the patient's general condition and observations made during autopsy. The observations recorded, made well into 1913, preclude authorship by an author who died in 1903. Werner von Blomberg (1878-1946) Born in Stargard, Pomerania, German Empire, Werner von Blomberg joined the Preußischen Hauptkadettenanstalt in Groß-Lichterfelde (near Berlin) in 1897 and became a Lieutenant in a preußischen Füsilierregiment. After graduating in 1907, Blomberg entered the General Staff in 1908. Serving with distinction on the Western Front during World War I, he was awarded the Pour le Mérite. In 1920, von Blomberg was appointed Chief of Staff of the Döberitz Brigade and in 1921 was made Chief of Staff of the Stuttgart Army Area. In 1925, Blomberg was made Chief of Army Training by General Hans von Seeckt. By 1927 Blomberg was a major-general and Chief of the Troop Office. After arguing with the powerful General Kurt von Schleicher in 1929, however, Blomberg was removed from his post and made military commander of East Prussia. In 1933, Blomberg rose to national prominence when he was appointed Minister of Defense in Adolf Hitler's government. Blomberg became one of Hitler's most devoted followers, and as such was nicknamed \\"Rubber Lion\\" by some of his critics in the army who were less than enthusiastic about Hitler. As Minister of Defense, Blomberg worked feverishly to expand the size and power of the army. In 1933 Blomberg was made a colonel-general for his services. In 1934, Blomberg encouraged Hitler to crack down on SA leader Ernst Röhm and his followers, who he believed posed a serious threat to the army. As such, he condoned and participated in the Night of the Long Knives. In the same year, after the death of Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg, he personally ordered all soldiers in the army to pledge the Reichswehreid oath of allegiance not to Volk and Fatherland, but to the new Reichspräsident and Führer (Adolf Hitler). In 1935 the Ministry of Defense was renamed to Ministry of War; Blomberg became Minister of War and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. In 1936, Blomberg was the first General Field Marshal appointed by Hitler. Blomberg's quick career surge alienated Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler, who conspired to oust Blomberg from power. After the Hossbach Memorandum meeting of November 1937, Hitler was dissatisfied with him. They struck in January 1938, when Blomberg, then 60, married Erna Gruhn (sometimes referred to as \\"Eva\\" or \\"Margarete\\"), a 26-year-old typist. A police officer discovered that Gruhn had been a prostitute with a criminal record and reported this to the Gestapo and Göring, who then informed Hitler, who ordered Blomberg to annul the marriage to avoid a scandal and preserve the integrity of the army. Blomberg refused to annul the marriage, and consequently resigned all of his posts on 27 January 1938 when Göring threatened to make his wife's past public knowledge. Several days later, Göring and Himmler accused Commander-in-Chief Werner von Fritsch of being a homosexual. Hitler used these opportunities for major reorganisation of the Wehrmacht. Von Fritsch was later acquitted, the events became known as Blomberg-Fritsch Affair. Blomberg and his wife were subsequently exiled for a year to the isle of Capri. Spending World War II in obscurity, Blomberg was captured by the Allies in 1945, after which time he gave evidence at the Nuremberg Trials. Blomberg died while in detention at Nuremberg in 1946.

BiographyEarly life and career= Shand was born in 1911 in Ngapara, North Otago. His parents were Gilbert Esme Tressillian Shand and Constance Kippenberger, both of whom were from prominent Canterbury families, who owned and operated a farm of their own in Ngapara. In 1922 the family moved to Kaikoura, establishing a new farm at Seaward Valley. He received his education at St Andrew's College, Christ's College, the University of Canterbury. His studies were cut short by the onset of the Great Depression and he returned home to work as a shepherd on the family farm from 1931 to 1933. He then worked freezing and flax industries from 1933 to 1935, taking an active role in trade union affairs. He was also an active sportsman, competing as a boxer while a student and also played sub-union rugby in Canterbury. On 8 February 1937 he married the medical doctor Claudia Lillian Weston. Her father, Claude Weston, was the second president of the National Party. In 1942 he finally completed his bachelors degree in commerce. The same year he completed his degree Shand volunteered for the Royal New Zealand Air Force and began flight training. He was gazetted as a pilot in January 1943 and in June that year he was promoted to Flying Officer. Between April 1944 and February 1945 he flew Hudson bombers and Catalina flying boats in the South Pacific campaign out of Fiji, Funafuti and Emirau. In 1945 he developed a hearing defect which resulted in him being placed on the reserve until World War II ended due to high-tone deafness. Shand returned to his family farm and proceeded to take a course at Canterbury Agricultural College in farm management. =Political career= He first stood for Parliament in against the incumbent Labour representative in the Marlborough electorate, Ted Meachen, and was unsuccessful. At the next election in , he was successful and held the Marlborough electorate until his death in 1969. Shand quickly became known in Parliament for his \\"fiery robustness\\" and became known as a passionate yet outspoken debater. He gained notoriety in 1947 when he tore up the pages of his copy of the Labour government's budget, though it was subsequently revealed he had cut most of the way through it with scissors beforehand. He was a cabinet minister in the First National Government as Postmaster-General, Minister of Civil Aviation and Minister for Rehabilitation from 1954 to 1957. He oversaw the expansion of Wellington International Airport and was also made extra land provisions for returned servicemen, based on his own experience as a rehabilitated farmer he was supportive of them becoming farmers. On one noted occasion Shand lost an argument in cabinet. Impetuously he said \\"Well gentlemen, if that's the way you feel about it, I'm getting out\\" as he left his chair, to which Prime Minister Sidney Holland retorted \\"Mr. Shand, if you go through that door you won't be coming back again\\" prompting Shand to hurriedly resume his seat. His elevation to cabinet was owed more to a desire by party leaders to pacify him, thinking it was easier to control the otherwise individualistic Shand if he was in cabinet (an thus bound by cabinet collective responsibility). During the Second National Government he was Minister of Labour (1960–1969), Minister of Immigration (1960–1969), and Minister of Mines (1960–1969), and Minister of Electricity (1963–1969). Prime Minister Keith Holyoake allotted him fifth place in his cabinet in recognition of Shand's strong performance critiquing the Second Labour Government from 1957 to 1960. Shand was also appointed chairman the Cabinet Committee on Government Administration where he played a major role in reorganising government administration by legislating the State Services Act, 1962. Shand's most prominent role was as Minister of Labour. He always made a point of knowing what went on at the location of a workplace dispute and built good working relationships with the trade union leaders at the New Zealand Federation of Labour (FOL), earning their trust and admiration for his directness and courage. He perpetually emphasised the importance of workplace productivity and developed an active interest in a whole range of workforce related issues. He oversaw the investigation and verdict of the Woodhouse Report in 1966, chaired by Owen Woodhouse, which proposed a radical \\"no-fault\\" accident compensation system (which later became the Accident Compensation Corporation). He broke ranks with the rest of cabinet in 1968 and joined the FOL in its opposition to the \\"nil wage order\\", however cabinet voted for it anyway to ensure an end to the practice of wage fixing by the Court of Arbitration. Shand had a predilection for \\"buying\\" industrial peace by accommodating (partially at least) higher wage demands which often caused problems for other ministers as it caused inflation and higher taxation. Shand lobbied Holyoake for the role of Minister of Finance following the death of Harry Lake in 1967. Ultimately he was passed over for the position in favour of Robert Muldoon, a junior minister. The rumored cause of this was a reported disagreement between Shand and Holyoake over the government's economic policies which also resulted in Shand relinquishing the chairmanship of the Cabinet Committee on Government Administration. Shand was one of the first politicians in New Zealand to grasp the significance that Britain's membership of the European Economic Community would have for New Zealand. He likewise understood the importance of international investment and became an early advocate for New Zealand joining the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Shand was seen as a likely successor to Holyoake as National Party leader following his 20 years in Parliament, 12 of them as a energetic and effective minister. Such an outcome was unable to come to fruition following the onset of lung cancer for Shand in early 1969 when speculation surrounding Holyoake's retirement was increasing. =Death= Shand had been a smoker all his life and was seldom seen without his pipe in his mouth. Just after the 1969 election campaign had begun he was hospitalised. Shand died as a result of lung cancer on 11 December 1969, just twelve days after being re-elected in that year's general election. In the , his son Anthony Shand stood as the National candidate to replace him, but was defeated in the greatest swing against a government since the 1935 general election. Shand's premature death eliminated him as a potential successor to the party leadership which may have delayed Holyoake's retirement. Ironically National's shock defeat at the Marlborough by-election was one of the major factors in inducing his eventual retirement in February 1972.

This led to duplicated effort, to a fragmentation of potential, and to lower efficiency than might have been achieved. There was no central German cryptography agency comparable to Britain’s Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS;), based at Bletchley Park. HistoryDepartments= In Germany, each cryptographic department was responsible for cryptanalytic operations. They included: *Deutsche Reichspost (DRP, Reich Mail Service) *Forschungstelle (Research Bureau, telephone intercept unit, part of the DRP) *Forschungsamt (Research Office, under the authority of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring) *Auslandsamt, Abteilung Z *Oberkommando der Wehrmacht/Chiffrierabteilung (OKW/Chi Wehrmacht Supreme Command/Decryption Department) *Oberkommando des Heeres/Abt. Fremde Heere Ost (OKH/FHO - Army Supreme Command/Foreign Armies East Department intelligence focused on Eastern nations' armies) *Oberkommando des Heeres/Abt. Fremde Heere West (OKH/FHW - Army Supreme Command/Foreign Armies West Department intelligence focused on Western nations' armies) *Oberkommando der Wehrmacht/Abwehr (OKW/Abwehr - Wehrmacht Supreme Command/Counterintelligence) *Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL - Air Force Supreme Command) *Oberkommando der Marine (OKM - Navy Supreme Command) *Reichssicherheithauptsamt (RSHA - Reich Security Main Office) While most contributed little to the German war effort, the Navy's OKM did have some remarkable successes in breaking Allied codes. The 2. Abteilung der Seekriegsleitung included the Marinenachrichtendienst (M.N.D.) and its III. Abteilung, radio intelligence. The B-Dienst (Beobachtungsdienst, \\"surveillance service\\",) and the xB-Dienst (\\"decryption service\\") were able to break into several important Allied radio communication circuits. =B-Dienst= The B-Dienst, created in the early 1930s, had broken the most widely used British naval code by 1935. When war came in 1939, B-Dienst specialists had broken enough British naval codes that the Germans knew the positions of all British warships. They had further success in the early stages of the war as the British were slow to change their codes. The B-Dienst could regularly read the British and Allied Merchants Ships (BAMS) code, which proved valuable for U-Boat warfare in the early phases of the Battle of the Atlantic. In February 1942, B-Dienst broke the code used for communication with many of the Atlantic convoys. Before the US entered the War at the end of 1941, B-Dienst could also read several American codes. This changed after April 1942, when the US Navy changed their code systems, but earlier, the ability to read American message traffic contributed to the success of \\"Operation Paukenschlag\\" (Operation Drumbeat), the successful U-boat attacks off the American East Coast in early 1942. In 1941, the US Navy refused, for security reasons, to equip the British Navy with their ECM Mark 1 encryption devices, so the British Admiralty introduced \\"Naval Cypher No. 3\\" for Allied radio communication and convoy coordination in the Atlantic. The B-Dienst concentrated on deciphering the new code, in September 1942 and from December 1942 to May 1943, 80 percent of the intercepted radio messages were read but only 10 percent were decrypted in time to take action.HyperWar Foundation: Compromise of Allied Codes and Ciphers by German Naval Communication Intelligence http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/ETO/Ultra/SRH-009/SRH009-6.html The British \\"Naval Cypher No. 5\\" is also known to have been broken by the B-Dienst, as were various low-grade British Naval and Air codes, including COFOX, MEDOX, FOXO, LOXO, SYKO, Air Force code and Aircraft Movement code. The US \\"Hagelin\\" field cipher machine and the French \\"Anglp\\" code were also often read. In addition, B-Dienst also cracked Soviet and Danish code systems. =Telephone cables= Apart from the notable successes of the German navy's decryption services, there were also some results from the other institutions. For example, the Reichspost was able to descramble scrambled voice transmission of the transatlantic telephone connection between the USA and Great Britain. For this purpose, an interception and descrambling facility was built in Noordwijk, in occupied Holland. From 1940, the Mail Service's descrambling specialists intercepted and understood classified telephone conversation between President Roosevelt and the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The facility relocated to a purpose built bunker facility in Valkenswaard where it remained until August 1944 when the facility had to relocate to Germany, the interception potential decreased, so did the number of phone calls intercepted. This was not classic codebreaking since none was involved; instead it was the exploitation of knowledge about a sophisticated technology. =Axis performance= Another success was the OKW/Chi 1941 cryptanalysis of the \\"Black\\" code used by US diplomats. Due to this, a huge interception facility in Lauf (Bavaria) could decrypt communication between US diplomats and Washington DC. The specialists in Lauf concentrated on the messages relating to the North African Campaign, so they could pass information to Feldmarschall Erwin Rommel about Allied plans and operations. The Germans also received the \\"Black\\" code from the Italians; Italian spies had photographed the code tables in the US embassy in Rome in September 1941. While the Germans appreciated the gift from their ally, they did not explain that they were already able to read \\"Black\\" code messages. In general, however, German performance in code breaking was weak due to the fragmentation of responsibility and specialized personnel. The Navy's B-Dienst was an exception to the rule, although its successes largely ended when the Allies began using more sophisticated encryption methods by 1943.

He made his first screen appearance on 22 August 1991. Casting MacDougall was a model before he took the role of Ryan in Home and Away. It was his first television role. When he auditioned for the part casting directors were \\"so impressed\\" that they did not consider his lack of experience and offered him a two-year contract.Kercher 1993, p.43. However, MacDougall only stayed with the soap for a year. When the actor departed in late 1992, he told Josephine Monroe from Inside Soap that because he loved playing Ryan, he would go back for a cameo appearance as long as the scriptwriters made his character bad. He added \\"I would have stayed longer before if the scripts had been good enough.\\" Development MacDougall described Ryan as a rich, good time guy \\"who happens to be a bastard!\\" He explained that Ryan was not very nice, calling him \\"egotistical, self-centred, and worldly so he knows how to pull off a few scams and set things up to advantage.\\" Ryan does not mind seeing other people suffer if they are in his way. An Inside Soap reporter commented that MacDougall and Ryan \\"are poles apart\\". Ryan began a relationship with Lucinda Croft (Dee Smart), while they both lived in Perth. The couple became \\"very serious\\" about each other, but they eventually broke up and Lucinda moved to Summer Bay. In The Official Home and Away Annual John Kercher explained that Ryan arrives in Summer Bay to \\"win back the affections\\" of Lucinda. But Ryan did not expect to find her dating Nick Parrish (Bruce Roberts). Kercher described Ryan as \\"very charming\\" with \\"extremely manipulative\\" tendencies. So when Lucinda's brother David (Guy Pearce) dies he uses it as an \\"opportunity\\" to comfort her, while hoping that it will lead to the reconciliation of their relationship. Ryan almost wins Lucinda back, but at the last minute Nick put up posters all over town saying how much he loved her and she decided to stay with him. Ryan left the Bay and began to come up with another way to win her back. Upon Ryan's return to Summer Bay, \\"a hot tempered love triangle\\" between him, Lucinda and Nick began. MacDougall stated \\"It's a strange situation. Lou doesn't know where her loyalties lie or her feelings. I'd feel sorry for anyone in that position.\\" The actor explained that Ryan is very optimistic and he sets up \\"little scams\\" to further himself in everyone's eyes. However, what he really wants to do is get Lucinda to admit that she feels something for him. Lucinda starts to show a bit more interest in Ryan, so viewers got to see what it must have been like between them before they split up. MacDougall said \\"There's constant tension between them and when you see them together on screen, you can't help thinking, 'Oh no, what's going to happen now?\\" The actor told an Inside Soap writer that Ryan takes great joy in seeing Nick squirm and he has no problem with trying to split him and Lucinda up. Nick becomes protective of Lucinda as he knows what Ryan is like. MacDougall commented that the cast worked hard in building up the love triangle and just when it looked like it was heading towards \\"a brilliant climax\\", he believed the scriptwriters had started to rest on their laurels. He did not think they did all they could to make the story work and he started to worry about the decline in the standards of the scripts. The actor told Monroe \\"I went to see the head scriptwriter and said 'Look, what's going on? What's going to happen?' He said they were running out of bad things for Ryan to do, so he goes through a strange metamorphosis and the plot just draws on for too long.\\" A writer for Home and Away – Official Collector's Edition stated that \\"old flames from way back Lucinda and Ryan created sparks\\".Black 2009, p.20. They added that Lucinda had a \\"big decision\\" to make in choosing between Ryan and Nick. But ultimately she decides to leave both of them and Summer Bay too.Black 2009, p.27. Storylines Ryan is a former flame of Lucinda whose brother David who attended the same University and played on the same Rugby team as him. Following David's death, Ryan arrives in Summer Bay to win Lou back and is almost successful in getting her to return home to Perth with him until local police officer Nick tells Lou how he feels about her. Ryan leaves defeated but returns several months later. There is still tension between him and Nick over Lou but this subsides when Ryan begins a relationship with Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons). This turns out to be a smokescreen to mask Ryan's true feelings for Lou. He and Lou begin seeing each other in secret until Marilyn witnesses them kissing and tells Nick. Nick's younger brother, Shane (Dieter Brummer) begins a harassment campaign against Ryan by vandalizing his caravan and stealing Ryan's car and dumping it in the sea. Ryan leaves but returns for a short while and helps support Sophie Simpson (Rebekah Elmaloglou), the mother of David's daughter Tamara (Emily & Chloe Hutton).

The current principal is Terrance McCotter, who took that position in 2019. Mr. McCotter is both an alumnus and former math teacher at the school. FVHS was named a \\"School of Distinction\\" in 2003, 2004, and 2005. History The present location of Fuquay-Varina High School campus opened in 1975; but the desegregated Fuquay Varina High School was established in 1963 where the school office was located on Woodrow Street. However, the building currently being demolished and rebuilt in anticipation of a brand new building in the fall of 2021. Currently, Fuquay-Varina High School is holding classes at Willow Spring High School for the next two years. The former High School campus, today's Fuquay-Varina Middle School built in 1918, has since been used as Fuquay-Varina Middle School. Prior to racial integration, the all-white High School at the now Fuquay-Varina Middle School location was called Fuquay Springs High School; the name change to present Fuquay-Varina High School was made at the time of the integration or desegregation planning merger with Fuquay Consolidated High School in accordance with supreme court decision Brown vs. Board of Education in 1954 that made segregation in public schools illegal. Student Council leadership in both Fuquay Consolidated High School and Fuquay Springs High School paved the way for the new proposed high school; it was at this time the current Bengal Tiger mascot and the current school colors Orange, Black, and White were voted on by both student bodies at Fuquay Consolidated High School and Fuquay Springs High School in to honor their unity as a future desegregated school and memorialise the equality of all students having an equal voice in 1963 establishing Fuquay-Varina High School. The school colors of White-segregated Fuquay Springs High School had been Green and White and the Mascot had been a Falcon, known as the Fuquay Falcons like Falcon Park, Fuquay-Varina, NC; the colors and Mascot for Black- segregated Fuquay Consolidated High School had been Maroon and Gold and the school's mascot had been a Bison, and they were known as the Fuquay Bison's. Community efforts led the Wake County Public School Board to propose a new high school complex in the town at the present site on Bengal Boulevard. In fall 1975, moved grades ten through 12 to the new campus; in 1977, the school added the 9th grade. To honor integration and equality of race in Fuquay- Varina High School students have historically since 1975 nominated from each grade one Black woman and one White woman to Homecoming Court with the exception of the senior class who nominates three Black women and three White women, with only one Queen from the six senior nominations voted on by the entire student body. During the four decades on the current campus, the enrollment of Fuquay-Varina High School has more than doubled, reflecting growth in southern Wake County. Major campus expansion projects were completed in 1993, 2001, and now 2020 with the anticipation of a brand new building in the fall of 2021. (Currently, Fuquay-Varina High School has been holding classes at Willow Spring High School since 2019.) The recent \\"School of Distinction\\" ratings reflect a tradition of achievement. During the 1960s for example, the school music department distinguished itself in State Band Competition, by winning five Superior Ratings; four of which were in the Grade Six (most difficult) music category. The Director was James D. Page. During this period, the school was also distinguished at the state level in dramatic arts and academics. The school's funding decreased due to the school for the first time in history losing 300 students of the 600 student Freshman class in Fall 2001 - Spring 2002 to the then newly built Middle Creek High School in 2002. In fall 2002 the new school (MCHS) had its first student body ever that only compromised 10th and rising 9th graders; there were no 11th graders at MCHS until 2003 and no 12th graders until 2004 when the original Sophomore class of 2002 became the upper classmen. Neighborhoods and families in Fuquay- Varina, Holly Springs, Willow Springs, Apex, and Cary were divided in fall 2002 because of the new school MCHS's districting lines in Wake County to district students between the newer school, MCHS, and the historically older school, FVHS, in Southern Wake County. In some instances, siblings in the same household would attend and be zoned to different schools, either FVHS or MCHS despite their proximity to either school. During this time of school redistricting, FVHS had 5 different principals between the years 2001–2006. Athletics Fuquay-Varina High School is a member of the North Carolina High School Athletic Association, and competes at the 4A level, which is the highest classification, based on enrollment. The athletic teams, nicknamed the \\"Bengals\\" (short for Bengal Tigers) wear orange, white, and black. Traditional rivals include Clayton High School, Harnett Central High School, Apex High School, and Cary High School, while newer rivalries with Middle Creek High School (which opened in 2002) and Holly Springs High School (which opened in 2007) have become more important in recent years. FVHS competes in the South Wake Athletic (SWAC) 4A conference. The 1985 Bengal football team played in the 2A state championship game. The FVHS team held the record for the most combined points scored in a North Carolina High School football game with their 83–56 victory over future NFL quarterback David Garrard's Southern Durham team. The men's basketball team won the 1993 Conference Tourney Championship, the school's only conference tournament title. The baseball team won the 2002 state 4A championship and 2018 state 4A championship. Other FVHS athletic teams that have won state titles in the last fifteen years include the men's golf team (3A, in 1997), women's soccer team (4A in 2018), women's cross-country team (3A, in 1996), and the wrestling team (3A, in 2000 and 2001). The \\"Orange Crush\\", the name of the school's student section, was one of the first of its kind in the area. The idea was to start a student section at the games to create an exciting atmosphere. That season the FVHS Varsity basketball team went undefeated at home while winning just one away game. The original shirts were all printed on campus in a screen-printing class and distributed to classmates. At the time, students were encouraged to put their graduating class on the back of the shirt as well as a last name or nickname. Today, these shirts can be commonly seen among the town, worn not only by high school students but many other residents, as the culture has become an iconic part of the town.

For example, an Occitan-speaker in France will probably be treated differently from a French-speaker.The Legal Aid Society-Employment Law Center, & the ACLU Foundation of North California (2002). Language Discrimination: Your Legal Rights. http://www.aclunc.org/library/publications/asset_upload_file489_3538.pdf Based on a difference in use of language, a person may automatically form judgments about another person's wealth, education, social status, character or other traits, which may lead to discrimination. In the mid-1980s, linguist Tove Skutnabb-Kangas, captured the idea of language-based discrimination as linguicism, which was defined as \\"ideologies and structures which are used to legitimate, effectuate, and reproduce unequal division of power and resources (both material and non-material) between groups which are defined on the basis of language\\".Quoted in Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove, and Phillipson, Robert, \\"'Mother Tongue': The Theoretical and Sociopolitical Construction of a Concept.\\" In Ammon, Ulrich (ed.) (1989). Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties, p. 455. Berlin, New York: Walter de Gruyter & Co. . Although different names have been given to this form of discrimination, they all hold the same definition. It is also important to note that linguistic discrimination is culturally and socially determined due to preference for one use of language over others. Carolyn McKinleyAnna Wierzbicka, Professor of Linguistics, Australian National University and author of 'Imprisoned by English, The Hazards of English as a Default Language, written in Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM), the universally convertible currency of communication, which can serve as a common auxiliary inter-language for speakers of different languages and a global means for clarifying, elucidating, storing, and comparing ideas\\" (194) (book review) is critical of a dominant language because it does not only discriminate against speakers of other languages, it also disadvantages monolinguals because they remain monolingual. Instead of using the indigenous languages along with the colonial languages, as McKinley also advocates, most African states still use the colonial language as the main medium of instruction. Furthermore, in authoritative reports by Unesco, it was found that the use of the former colonial languages in Africa benefited only the elite and disadvantaged the bulk of the populations. Although English has worldwide meaning as a language of discourse, it is not neutral as it leads too much to a culture-dependent perspective in thinking and talking by the use of culturally bound value concepts, often blind value judgments and frames of reference inherent to and shaped by English culture, according to Anna Wierzbicka. Linguistic prejudice It can be noted that speakers with certain accents may experience prejudice. For example, some accents hold more prestige than others depending on the cultural context. However, with so many dialects, it can be difficult to determine which is the most preferable. The best answer linguists can give, such as the authors of \\"Do You Speak American?\\", is that it depends on the location and the speaker. Research has determined however that some sounds in languages may be determined to sound less pleasant naturally.Bresnahan, M. J., Ohashi, R., Nebashi, R., Liu, W. Y., & Shearman, S. M. (2002). Attitudinal and affective response toward accented English. Language and Communication, 22, 171–185. Also, certain accents tend to carry more prestige in some societies over other accents. For example, in the United States speaking General American (i.e., an absence of a regional, ethnic, or working class accent) is widely preferred in many contexts such as television journalism. Also, in the United Kingdom, the Received Pronunciation is associated with being of higher class and thus more likeable. In addition to prestige, research has shown that certain accents may also be associated with less intelligence, and having poorer social skills.Bradac, J. J. (1990). Language attitudes and impression formation. In H. Giles & W. P. Robinson (Eds.), Handbook of language and social psychology (pp. 387–412). London: John Wiley. An example can be seen in the difference between Southerners and Northerners in the United States, where people from the North are typically perceived as being less likable in character, and Southerners are perceived as being less intelligent. As sociolinguist, Lippi-Green, argues, \\"It has been widely observed that when histories are written, they focus on the dominant class... Generally studies of the development of language over time are very narrowly focused on the smallest portion of speakers: those with power and resources to control the distribution of information.\\" Language and social group saliency Linguistic discrimination is sometimes linked with belonging to a social group, as in patriotism and nationalism. This poster is propaganda from World War I It is natural for human beings to want to identify with others. One way we do this is by categorizing individuals into specific social groups. While some groups may be readily noticeable (such as those defined by ethnicity or gender), other groups are less salient. Linguist Carmen Fought explains how an individual's use of language may allow another person to categorize them into a specific social group that may otherwise be less apparent. For example, in the United States it is common to perceive Southerners as less intelligent. Belonging to a social group such as the South may be less salient than membership to other groups that are defined by ethnicity or gender. Language provides a bridge for prejudice to occur for these less salient social groups.Jaspal, R. (2009). Language and social identity: a psychosocial approach. Psych-Talk, 64, 17-20.  Linguistic discrimination and colonization  History of linguistic imperialism = The impacts of colonization on linguistic traditions vary based on the form of colonization experienced: trader, settler or exploitation. Congolese-American linguist Salikoko Mufwene describes trader colonization as one of the earliest forms of European colonization. In regions such as the western coast of Africa as well as the Americas, trade relations between European colonizers and indigenous peoples led to the development of pidgin languages. Some of these languages, such as Delaware Pidgin and Mobilian Jargon, were based on Native American languages, while others, such as Nigerian Pidgin and Cameroonian Pidgin, were based on European ones. As trader colonization proceeded mainly via these hybrid languages, rather than the languages of the colonizers, scholars like Mufwene contend that it posed little threat to indigenous languages. A photo of students at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School Trader colonization was often followed by settler colonization, where European colonizers settled in these colonies to build new homes. Hamel, a Mexican linguist, argues that \\"segregation\\" and \\"integration\\" were two primary ways through which settler colonists engaged with aboriginal cultures. In countries such as Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, and those in the Caribbean, segregation and genocide decimated indigenous societies. Widespread death due to war and illness caused many indigenous populations to lose their indigenous languages. In contrast, in countries that pursued policies of \\"integration\\", such as Mexico, Guatemala and the Andean states, indigenous cultures were lost as aboriginal tribes mixed with colonists. In these countries, the establishment of new European orders led to the adoption of colonial languages in governance and industry. In addition, European colonists also viewed the dissolution of indigenous societies and traditions as necessary for the development of a unified nation state. This led to efforts to destroy tribal languages and cultures: in Canada and the United States, for example, Native children were sent to boarding schools such as Col. Richard Pratt's Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Today, in countries such as the United States and Australia, which were once settler colonies, indigenous languages are spoken by only a small minority of the populace. Portrait of Lord Macaulay Mufwene also makes a distinction between settler colonies and exploitation colonies. In the latter, the colonization process was focused on the extraction of raw materials needed in Europe. As a result, Europeans were less invested in their exploitation colonies, and few colonists planned to build homes in these colonies. As a result, indigenous languages were able to survive to a greater extent in these colonies compared to settler colonies. In exploitation colonies, colonial languages were often only taught to a small local elite. During the British Raj, for example, Lord Macaulay highlighted the need for \\"… a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions who govern… a class of persons, Indian in blood and color, but English in taste, in my opinion, in morals and in intellect\\" in his now- famous \\"Macaulay minutes\\", which were written in support of the English Education Act of 1835. The linguistic differences between the local elite and other locals exacerbated class stratification, and also increased inequality in access to education, industry and civic society in postcolonial states. = Linguistic discrimination and culture = Several postcolonial literary theorists have drawn a link between linguistic discrimination and the oppression of indigenous cultures. Prominent Kenyan author Ngugi wa Thiong'o, for example, argues in his book \\"Decolonizing the Mind\\" that language is both a medium of communication, as well as a carrier of culture. As a result, linguistic discrimination resulting from colonization has facilitated the erasure of pre-colonial histories and identities. For example, African slaves were taught English and forbidden to use their indigenous languages. This severed the slaves' linguistic and thus cultural connection to Africa. = Colonial languages and class = In contrast to settler colonies, in exploitation colonies, education in colonial tongues was only accessible to a small indigenous elite. Both the British Macaulay Doctrine, as well as French and Portuguese systems of assimilation, for example, sought to create an \\"elite class of colonial auxiliaries\\" who could serve as intermediaries between the colonists and local populace. As a result, fluency in colonial languages became a signifier of class in colonized lands. In postcolonial states, linguistic discrimination continues to reinforce notions of class. In Haiti, for example, working-class Haitians predominantly speak Haitian Creole, while members of the local bourgeoise are able to speak both French and Creole. Members of this local elite frequently conduct business and politics in French, thereby excluding many of the working-class from such activities. In addition, D. L. Sheath, an advocate for the use of indigenous languages in India, also writes that the Indian elite associates nationalism with a unitary identity, and in this context, \\"uses English as a means of exclusion and an instrument of cultural hegemony”. = Linguistic discrimination in education = Photo of school children in Haiti Class disparities in postcolonial nations are often reproduced through education. In countries such as Haiti, schools attended by the bourgeoisie are usually of higher quality and use colonial languages as their means of instruction. On the other hand, schools attended by the rest of the population are often taught in Haitian Creole. Scholars such as Hebblethwaite argue that Creole-based education will improve learning, literacy and socioeconomic mobility in a country where 95% of the population are monolingual in Creole. However, resultant disparities in colonial language fluency and educational quality can impede social mobility. On the other hand, areas such as French Guiana have chosen to teach colonial languages in all schools, often to the exclusion of local indigenous languages. As colonial languages were viewed by many as the \\"civilized\\" tongues, being \\"educated\\" often meant being able to speak and write in these colonial tongues. Indigenous language education was often seen as an impediment to achieving fluency in these colonial languages, and thus deliberately suppressed. Photo of a school in Uganda Certain British colonies such as Uganda and Kenya have historically had a policy of teaching in indigenous languages and only introducing English in the upper grades. This policy was a legacy of the \\"dual mandate\\" as conceived by Lord Lugate, a prominent British administrator in colonial Africa. However, by the post-war period, English was increasingly viewed as necessary skill for accessing professional employment and better economic opportunities. As a result, there was increasing support amongst the populace for English-based education, which Kenya's Ministry of Education adopted post-independence, and Uganda following their civil war. Later on, members of the Ominde Commission in Kenya expressed the need for Kiswahili in promoting a national and pan-African identity. Kenya therefore began to offer Kiswahili as a compulsory, non-examinable subject in primary school, but it remained secondary to English as a medium of instruction. While the mastery of colonial languages may provide better economic opportunities, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child also states that minority children have the right to \\"use [their] own [languages]\\". The suppression of indigenous languages within the education system appears to contravene this treaty. In addition, children who speak indigenous languages can also be disadvantaged when educated in foreign languages, and often have high illiteracy rates. For example, when the French arrived to \\"civilize\\" Algeria, which included imposing French on local Algerians, the literacy rate in Algeria was over 40%, higher than that in France at the time. However, when the French left in 1962, the literacy rate in Algiers was at best 10-15%. = Linguistic discrimination in governance = As colonial languages are used as the languages of governance and commerce in many colonial and postcolonial states, locals who only speak indigenous languages can be disenfranchised. For example, when representative institutions were introduced to the Algoma region in what is now modern-day Canada, the local returning officer only accepted the votes of individuals who were enfranchised, which required indigenous peoples to \\"read and write fluently... [their] own and another language, either English or French\\". This caused political parties to increasingly identify with settler perspectives rather than indigenous ones. Even today, many postcolonial states continue to use colonial languages in their public institutions, even though these languages are not spoken by the majority of their residents. For example, the South African justice system still relies primarily on English and Afrikaans as its primary languages, even though most South Africans speak indigenous languages. In these situations, the use of colonial languages can present barriers to participation in public institutions. Examples Linguistic discrimination is often defined in terms of prejudice of language. It is important to note that although there is a relationship between prejudice and discrimination, they are not always directly related. Prejudice can be defined as negative attitudes towards a person based on their membership of a social group, whereas discrimination can be seen as the acts towards them. The difference between the two should be recognized because prejudice may be held against someone, but it may not be acted on.Whitley, B.E., & Kite, M.E. (2010) The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination. Ed 2. pp.379-383. Cencage Learning: Belmont. The following are examples of linguistic prejudice which may result in discrimination. =Linguistic prejudice and minority groups= While, theoretically, any speaker may be the victim of linguicism regardless of social and ethnic status, oppressed and marginalized social minorities are often the most consistent targets, due to the fact that the speech varieties that come to be associated with such groups have a tendency to be stigmatized. =In Canada= French communities in Quebec, New Brunswick, Ontario and the Red River Rebellion The Canadian federation and provinces have historically discriminated against their French-speaking population in favor of the financially powerful English-speaking population. Anglophones in Quebec The Charter of the French Language, first established in 1977 and amended several times since, has been accused of being discriminatory by English-speakers. The law makes French the official language of Quebec and mandates its use (with exceptions) in government offices and communiques, schools, and in commercial public relations. The law is a way of preventing linguistic discrimination against the majority francophone population of Quebec whom were for a very long time controlled by the English minority of the province. The law also seeks to protect French against the growing social and economic dominance of English. Though the English-speaking population had been shrinking since the 1960s, it was hastened by the law, and the 2006 census showed a net loss of 180,000 native English-speakers.Richard Y. Bourhis & Pierre Foucher, \\"Bill 103: Collective Rights and the declining vitality of the English-speaking communities of Quebec \\" , Canadian Institute for Research on Linguistic Minorities, Version 3, 25 November 2010 Despite this, speaking English at work continues to be strongly correlated with higher earnings, with French-only speakers earning significantly less.Louis N. Christofides & Robert Swidinsky, \\"The Economic Returns to the Knowledge and Use of a Second Official Language: English in Quebec and French in the Rest-of-Canada\\", Canadian Public Policy – Analyse de Politiques Vol. XXXVI, No. 2 2010 The law is credited with successfully raising the status of French in a predominantly English- speaking economy, and it has been influential in countries facing similar circumstances. However, amendements have made it less powerful and thus less effective than it was in the past. = In Europe =  Linguistic disenfranchisement rate  The linguistic disenfranchisement rate in the EU can significantly vary across countries. For residents in two EU-countries that are either native speakers of English or proficient in English as a foreign language the disenfranchisement rate is equal to zero. In his study \\"Multilingual communication for whom? Language policy and fairness in the European Union\\" Michele Gazzola comes to the conclusion that the current multilingual policy of the EU is not in the absolute the most effective way to inform Europeans about the EU; in certain countries, additional languages may be useful to minimize linguistic exclusion.Michele Gazzola, Multilingual communication for whom? Language policy and fairness in the European Union, European Union Politics, 2016, Vol. 17(4) 546–569 In the 24 countries examined, an English-only language policy would exclude 51% to 90% of adult residents. A language regime based on English, French and German would disenfranchise 30% to 56% of residents, whereas a regime based on six languages would bring the shares of excluded population down to 9–22%. After Brexit, the rates of linguistic exclusion associated with a monolingual policy and with a trilingual and a hexalingual regime are likely to increase.  Language policy of the British Empire in Ireland, Wales and Scotland  *Cromwell's conquest, the long English colonisation and Great Irish Famine made Irish a minority language by the end of the 19th century. It had no official status until the establishment of Republic of Ireland. *In Wales, it was forbidden to speak Welsh in schools. *Scottish Gaelic also had no official status until 2005; it was banned from the educational system because it was \\"one of the chief, principal causes of barbarity and incivility\\" in the words of one statute. *Scots was in 1946 not considered \\"a suitable medium of education or culture\\".Primary education: a report of the Advisory Council on Education in Scotland, Scottish Education Department 1946, p. 75  Other examples  * Basque: public usage of Basque was restricted in Francoist Spain, 1939 to 1965. Galician and Catalan have similar histories. * Vergonha is the term used for the effect of various policies of the government of France on its citizens whose mother tongue was one of so-called patois. In 1539, with Article 111 of the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, French–the language of the Île-de-France–became the only official language in the country despite being spoken by only a minority of the population. In education and administration, it was forbidden to use regional languages, such as Occitan, Catalan, Basque and Breton. The French government still has not ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. *Magyarisation in the 19th-century Kingdom of Hungary. *Norwegianization: Former policy carried out by the Norwegian government directed at the Sámi and later the Kven people of the Sapmi region in Northern Norway. *Germanisation: Prussian discrimination of West Slavs in the 19th century, such as the removal of Polish from secondary (1874) and primary (1886) schools, the use of corporal punishment leading to such events as the Września school strike. *Russification: 19th century policies on the territories seized due to Partitions of Poland, such as banning Polish, Lithuanian and Belarusian in public places (1864), later (1880s), Polish was banned in schools and offices of Congress Poland. Ukrainian and Romanian were also discriminated against. Under the Russian Empire, there were some attempts in 1899–1917 to make Russian the only official language of Finland. In the Soviet Union, following the phase of Korenizatsiya (\\"indigenization\\") and before Perestroika (late 1930s to late 1980s), Russian was called \\"the language of friendship of nations\\" to the disadvantage of other languages of the Soviet Union. *Anti-Hungarian Slovak language law * Dutch in Belgium after its independence in 1830. French was for a long time the only official language and the only language of education, administration, law and justice despite Dutch being the most common language. This has led to widespread language shift in Brussels. Discrimination slowly faded over the decades and formally ended in the 1960s, when the Dutch version of the constitution became equal to the French version. * The russification and restraining of the linguistic rights of federal subjects in the Russia, most notably in the federal subject of Tatarstan. * Serb organisations in Montenegro have reported discrimination of Serbian. =In the United States= Perpetuation of discriminatory practices through terminology Here and elsewhere the terms 'standard' and 'non-standard' make analysis of linguicism difficult. These terms are used widely by linguists and non-linguists when discussing varieties of American English that engender strong opinions, a false dichotomy which is rarely challenged or questioned. This has been interpreted by linguists Nicolas Coupland, Rosina Lippi-Green, and Robin Queen (among others) as a discipline-internal lack of consistency which undermines progress; if linguists themselves cannot move beyond the ideological underpinnings of 'right' and 'wrong' in language, there is little hope of advancing a more nuanced understanding in the general population.Coupland, N. (1999). \\"Sociolinguistic Prevarication About 'Standard English'\\" Review article appearing in Tony Bex and Richard J. Watts (eds) Standard English: the Widening Debate London:RoutledgeLippi-Green, R. (2012) English with an Accent: Language, Ideology and Discrimination in the U.S.. Second revised, expanded edition. New York: Routledge. African-Americans Because some African- Americans speak a particular non-standard variety of English which is often seen as substandard, they are often targets of linguicism. AAVE is often perceived by members of mainstream American society as indicative of low intelligence or limited education, and as with many other non-standard dialects and especially creoles, it has sometimes been called \\"lazy\\" or \\"bad\\" English. The linguist John McWhorter has described this particular form of linguicism as particularly problematic in the United States, where non- standard linguistic structures are often deemed \\"incorrect\\" by teachers and potential employers in contrast to other countries such as Morocco, Finland and Italy where diglossia (the ability to switch between two or more dialects or languages) is an accepted norm, and non-standard usage in conversation is seen as a mark of regional origin, not of intellectual capacity or achievement. For example, an African-American who uses a typical AAVE sentence such as \\"He be comin' in every day and sayin' he ain't done nothing\\" may be judged as having a deficient command of grammar, whereas, in fact, such a sentence is constructed based on a complex grammar which is different from that of standard English, not a degenerate form of it.Dicker, Susan J. (2nd ed., 2003). Languages in America: A Pluralist View, pp. 7-8. Multilingual Matters Ltd. . A listener may misjudge the user of such a sentence to be unintellectual or uneducated. The speaker may be intellectually capable, educated, and proficient in standard English, but chose to say the sentence in AAVE for social and sociolinguistic reasons such as the intended audience of the sentence, a phenomenon known as code switching. Hispanic Americans and linguicism Another form of linguicism is evidenced by the following: in some parts of the United States, a person who has a strong Mexican accent and uses only simple English words may be thought of as poor, poorly educated, and possibly an undocumented immigrant. However, if the same person has a diluted accent or no noticeable accent at all and can use a myriad of words in complex sentences, they are likely to be perceived as more successful, better educated, and a \\"legitimate citizen\\". American Sign Language users For centuries, users of American Sign Language (ASL) have faced linguistic discrimination based on the perception of the legitimacy of signed languages compared to spoken languages. This attitude was explicitly expressed in the Milan Conference of 1880 which set precedence for public opinion of manual forms of communication, including ASL, creating lasting consequences for members of the Deaf community. The conference almost unanimously (save a handful of allies such as Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet), reaffirmed the use of oralism, instruction conducted exclusively in spoken language, as the preferred education method for Deaf individuals. These ideas were outlined in eight resolutions which ultimately resulted in the removal of Deaf individuals from their own educational institutions, leaving generations of Deaf persons to be educated single-handedly by hearing individuals. Due to misconceptions about ASL, it was not recognized as its own, fully functioning language until recently. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe proved ASL to be its own language based on its unique structure and grammar, separate from that of English. Before this, ASL was thought to be merely a collection of gestures used to represent English. Because of its use of visual space, it was mistakenly believed that its users are of a lesser mental capacity. The misconception that ASL users are incapable of complex thought was prevalent, although this has decreased as further studies about its recognition of a language have taken place. For example, ASL users faced overwhelming discrimination for the supposedly \\"lesser\\" language that they use and were met with condescension especially when using their language in public. Another way discrimination against ASL is evident is how, despite research conducted by linguists like Stokoe or Clayton Valli and Cecil Lucas of Gallaudet University, ASL is not always recognized as a language. Its recognition is crucial both for those learning ASL as an additional language, and for prelingually-deaf children who learn ASL as their first language. Linguist Sherman Wilcox concludes that given that it has a body of literature and international scope, to single ASL out as unsuitable for a foreign language curriculum is inaccurate. Russel S. Rosen also writes about government and academic resistance to acknowledging ASL as a foreign language at the high school or college level, which Rosen believes often resulted from a lack of understanding about the language. Rosen and Wilcox's conclusions both point to discrimination ASL users face regarding its status as a language, that although decreasing over time is still present. In the medical community, there is immense bias against deafness and ASL. This stems from the belief that spoken languages are superior to sign languages. Because 90% of deaf babies are born to hearing parents, who are usually unaware of the existence of the Deaf Community, they often turn to the medical community for guidance. Medical and audiological professionals, who are typically biased against sign languages, encourage parents to get a cochlear implant for their deaf child in order for the child to use spoken language. Research shows, however, that deaf kids without cochlear implants acquire ASL with much greater ease than deaf kids with cochlear implants acquire spoken English. In addition, medical professionals discourage parents from teaching ASL to their deaf kid to avoid compromising their English although research shows that learning ASL does not interfere with a child's ability to learn English. In fact, the early acquisition of ASL proves to be useful to the child in learning English later on. When making a decision about cochlear implantation, parents are not properly educated about the benefits of ASL or the Deaf Community. This is seen by many members of the Deaf Community as cultural and linguistic genocide. = In Africa = * Anglophone Cameroonians: the central Cameroonian government has pushed francophonization in the English-speaking regions of the country despite constitutional stipulations on bilingualism. Measures include appointing French-speaking teachers and judges (in regions with Common Law) despite local desires. * South Africa: Carolyn McKinleyAssociate professor in the education department of the University of Cape Town and author of 'Language and Power in Post-Colonial Schooling: Ideologies in Practice' is highly critical of the language policy in the South African educational system, which she describes as 'anglonormatif', because the increasing anglicisation becomes 'normative' in the education system. The universities of Pretoria, Free State and Unisa want to anglicise completely. = In the Middle East = * At the turn of the eighth century, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan decreed that Arabic would replace Medieval Greek and the Coptic language as the administrative language of the empire. Coptic gradually declined within a few hundred years and suffered violent persecutions, especially under the Mamluke Sultanate of Cairo, leading to its virtual extinction by the 17th century. * The Kurdish languages are under pressure in many countries where they are spoken. Publishing materials in Kurdish in Syria is forbidden,Repression of Kurds in Syria is widespread , Amnesty International Report, March 2005. though this prohibition is not enforced any more due to the Syrian civil war.. Until August 2002, Turkey placed severe restrictions on the use of Kurdish, including a ban on its use in education and broadcast media.Special Focus Cases: Leyla Zana, Prisoner of Conscience Kurdish performers banned, Appeal from International PEN In March 2006, Turkey allowed private television channels to begin airing programming in Kurdish. However, the Turkish government said that they must avoid showing children's cartoons, or educational programs that teach Kurdish, and could broadcast only for 45 minutes a day or four hours a week.Turkey to get Kurdish television The state-run Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) started its 24-hour Kurdish television station on 1 January 2009 with the motto \\"we live under the same sky\\". The Turkish Prime Minister sent a video message in Kurdish to the opening ceremony, which was attended by Minister of Culture and other state officials. The channel uses the X, W, and Q letters during broadcasting. However, most of these restrictions on private Kurdish television channels were relaxed in September 2009. In 2010, Kurdish municipalities in the southeast began printing marriage certificates, water bills, construction and road signs, as well as emergency, social and cultural notices in Kurdish alongside Turkish. Also, Imams began to deliver Friday sermons in Kurdish and Esnaf price tags in Kurdish. Many mayors were tried for issuing public documents in Kurdish language. The Kurdish alphabet is not recognized in Turkey, and prior to 2013 the use of Kurdish names containing the letters x, w, and q, which do not exist in the Turkish alphabet, was not allowed. In 2012, Kurdish-language lessons became an elective subject in public schools. Previously, Kurdish education had only been possible in private institutions. = In Asia = * Suppression of Korean during Japanese rule in Korea, 1910 to 1945. *Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia * The brutality and linguicism against Tamils in Sri Lanka which took thousands of Tamil lives because of their language. This was rooted from \\"The Sinhala Only Act\\", formerly the Official Language Act No. 33 of 1956, that was passed in the Parliament of Ceylon in 1956. Black July was the peak of the violence against Tamils in 1983. *China: In the 2000s the Chinese government began promoting the use of Mandarin Chinese in areas where Cantonese is spoken. In 2010 this gave rise to the Guangzhou Television Cantonese controversy. This has also been a point of contention with Hong Kong, which is located in the general area where Cantonese is spoken. Cantonese has become a means of asserting Hong Kong's political identity as separate from mainland China. =Texts= Linguicism applies to written, spoken, or signed languages. The quality of a book or article may be judged by the language in which it is written. In the scientific community, for example, those who evaluated a text in two language versions, English and the national Scandinavian language, rated the English-language version as being of higher scientific content.Jenkins, Jennifer (2003). World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students, p. 200. Routledge. . The Internet operates a great deal using written language. Readers of a web page, Usenet group, forum post, or chat session may be more inclined to take the author seriously if the language is written in accordance with the standard language. = Music = A catalog of contemporary episodes of linguistic bigotry reported in the media has been assembled by critical applied linguist, Steven Talmy, which can be found here =Prejudice= In contrast to the previous examples of linguistic prejudice, linguistic discrimination involves the actual treatment of individuals based on use of language. Examples may be clearly seen in the workplace, in marketing, and in education systems. For example, some workplaces enforce an English-only policy, which is part of an American political movement that pushes for English to be accepted as the official language. In the United States, the federal law, Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects non-native speakers from discrimination in the workplace based on their national origin or use of dialect. There are state laws which also address the protection of non-native speakers, such as the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. However, industries often argue in retrospect that clear, understandable English is often needed in specific work settings in the U.S. See also  * Linguistic insecurity * Schizoglossia * Standard language ideology * Cultural assimilation * Cultural genocide * Indigenous language * Language death * Language ideology * Language policy * Linguistic imperialism * Linguistic profiling * Minoritized language * Nonstandard dialect * Official language * Linguistic prescriptivism * Prestige (sociolinguistics) * Economics of language * Raciolinguistics References * Literature *Skutnabb- Kangas et al.
