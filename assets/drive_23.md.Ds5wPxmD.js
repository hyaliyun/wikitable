The surface area measures 13.5 km2 while the depths in the different areas range between 0.93 m and 1.59 m. The depths have become much shallower currently. The volume of the lake is estimated as 0.013 cu km. The lake is physiographically characterized by a saucer shaped basin with gentle slope and a much silted bottom. Physico- chemical analysis of the water samples from the lake reveal highly polluted condition. There occurs rise in the water temperature while the turbidity rate also stands high. The water in many areas is found to be highly acidic (pH-3.6) while in other areas high alkalinity (pH-9.3) has been noticed. Observation of high concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide coupled with lower values of dissolved oxygen in different seasons reveal the deteriorating quality of water. Ecology Ikop Lake is currently under great human pressure due to heavy encroachments due to the development of farms by a number of fishing co-operative societies.

The original memorial consisted of a painted concrete obelisk, with bronze plaques and wreath, and concrete flower boxes to either side. After the council proposed landscaping work at Islington Green, it became clear in 2004 that the old memorial needed to be replaced, and it was demolished in 2006. A new memorial was completed in 2007, designed by artist . His proposal for a twisted stone ring, reminiscent of a wreath, was accepted by a memorial commission, which included representatives from the local Royal British Legion, the Canonbury Society, and representatives from the council. The stone for the new memorial was sourced from Fujian province in eastern China, and the ring was carved in China before being shipped to England. An inscription on a nearby slab repeats the words from the original memorial, \\"In Memory of the Fallen\\"; separate slabs bear the words \\"Land\\", \\"Sea\\", \\"Air\\" and \\"Home\\". The project cost ¬£490,000, of which the stone for the memorial, and the apron and walls, cost approximately ¬£100,000.

Birks n√©e Thomas was born in Adelaide, South Australia on 12 March 1856 to English-born parents William Kyffin Thomas, proprietor of the Observer and Register newspapers, and his wife Mary Jane Thomas, n√©e Good. Known to her family as Rose, Birks was heavily involved in the Flinders Street Baptist Church in Adelaide that her father helped establish. In 1879 Birks married her sister's widower, wealthy Baptist merchant Charles Napier Birks and became the stepmother to her six nieces and nephews. The Birks family would later establish the Charles Birks & Co department store in Rundle Street, Adelaide. Philanthropy Throughout her life Birks was involved in advancing women's rights and the welfare and social issues of the day. Birks presided over several Baptist women's associations including a mothers' union and a women's guild which she established to provide a support network to working women members of her church. In 1882 Birks joined the predecessor of the Women's Suffrage League, the Ladies' Social Purity Society taking the role of treasurer. Following South Australian women's enfranchisement, Birks joined the Woman's League committee and was among the earliest women appointed to the Adelaide Hospital board and the Queen Victoria Maternity Home board. In 1902 Birks helped to found and became vice-president of the South Australian branch of the National Council of Women of Australia with fellow suffragist Mary Lee. Women's suffrage Birks and her husband would often host 'drawing room afternoons' in their Glenelg home to discuss the key social issues of the day. Inevitably this would lead to the discussion of women's rights and the issue of suffrage, and Birks was key in gaining local support for women's enfranchisement. Through her role in the Ladies' Social Purity Society, Birks quickly became involved in the Women's Suffrage League, accepting the position of Treasurer at her second meeting in 1888. Birks would hold this position until the League ceased operation and during this time she travelled to England to meet with women involved in the British suffragette movement. Birks was proudly the first woman at the Glenelg polling station to vote in April 1896. Young Women's Christian Association Birks was elected President of the Adelaide Young Women's Christian Association in 1902 and is credited with its expansion and the modernisation of the Australasian movement. Under Birks' leadership the Adelaide YWCA was the first branch to introduce junior membership in 1893, opening club activities to girls as young as ten. Other innovations included introducing child-rearing lectures and classes promoting the development of womanhood 'science'. Birks was involved in the YWCA internationally and attended conferences in London and Paris in 1906 and Berlin in 1910 as the Australasian member of the YWCA world committee. In 1911 she launched the YWCA Travellers' Aid Society to support government-assisted immigrants, particularly young women who intended to seek work as domestic servants. In June 1914 the Rose Birks wing of the YWCA hostel in Adelaide was opened by Lady Galway. Death Committed to her church until the end, Birks collapsed and died of myocarditis while addressing a meeting of the College Park Congregational Church in Adelaide on 3 October 1911. Birks is buried at West Terrace Cemetery, Adelaide.

The King of Nepal is expected to sign a decree allowing increased Chinese immigration into Nepal. AXE fears this will lead to undue influence on Nepal's affairs by communist China. The immigration bill has been promoted by Ghotak, the King's principal advisor, who believes himself to be the inheritor of the spirit of Karkotek, Lord of All Snakes, and an important figure in Nepalese mythology. Upon arrival in Namche Bazaar Carter is briefed by Harry Angsley of British intelligence who is leaving Nepal due to sudden illness. Carter is followed from his meeting with Angsley by a British journalist, Hilary Cobb, who tries to persuade Carter to let her join him. Carter threatens Cobb and sets off alone to Kathmandu. In Kathmandu, Carter arrives at the house of Leeunghi ‚Äì a respected local patriarch and opponent of Khotak. Carter, Leeunghi, and his daughter, Khaleen, plan to disrupt Khotak's next meeting where he intends to incite the audience into a religious frenzy and get them to sign his immigration petition. At the meeting Ghotak reminds the audience of his supernatural mandate; his words and deeds are supported by Karkotek and his foes are destroyed by the Yeti. Leeunghi objects to Ghotak's interpretation and Ghotak responds by challenging Leeunghi to stay overnight in the mountains. If the Yeti does not kill him it is a sign that Ghotak is not telling the truth. Leeunghi sets off alone into the mountains. When he does not return the next day Carter goes into the mountains to search for him. Carter discovers Leeunghi's body torn limb from limb apparently by some wild animal. Carter challenges Ghotak that he too will spend the night in the mountains to disprove the existence of the Yeti. As Carter settles in for the night in his camp in the mountains he is disturbed by Hilary Cobb who has followed him. Hilary is attacked by the Yeti and Carter fights it off. Next morning Carter and Hilary discover a company of Chinese soldiers in a remote site awaiting orders from Ghotak. Carter fires his rifle to start an avalanche, which buries the entire company. Carter confronts Ghotak upon his return to Kathmandu. The next day, Ghotak heads into the mountains for his biweekly meditation. Carter follows but is surprised and captured by Ghotak's henchmen. Ghotak takes Carter to a remote cave where the creature everyone believes to be a Yeti is caged. Ghotak informs Carter that he has raised the creature since it was born 20 years previously. Ghotak allows it out of its cage to feed on animals and humans but it always returns to its cage. Ghotak releases the animal and it chases after Carter. Carter fights it and manages to kill it. He drags its body back to Kathmandu. Carter confronts Ghotak in his temple. Knowing he has lost local support Ghotak flees.

It was designed by architect Karl Langer as his own home and built in 1950. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  A vacant block of land on a southern slope in St Lucia was acquired by Karl and Gertrude Langer in 1950 as the site for their new home. The house, a two storeyed brick structure with flat roof designed by Dr Karl Langer was completed in the same year. It remained the home of Karl and Gertrude Langer till their deaths in 1969 and 1984 respectively. Constructed under post war building restrictions, including a floor area limit of 12.5 squares or 13.5 squares if a staircase was incorporated, the design was the product of Karl Langer's research into local climatic issues and his European architectural training. At the rear of the house a rainforest garden was established, a unique undertaking at that time, using indigenous plants such as ferns, native violets and verbenas, cunjevois, walking stick palms, myrtle bushes, ground orchids and rainforest trees. The front garden, a more formal arrangement with a hedge and fish pond was designed in the Japanese style. Timber furniture designed by Karl Langer in the 1930s was used to furnish the house. Karl Langer was born in Vienna in 1903 where he lived until emigrating to Australia in 1939 with his wife Gertrude. Karl studied architecture in Vienna most notably in the Master Class run by Peter Behrens at the Viennese Academy graduating in 1926. During this time Karl had worked in the office of Josef Frank, who was to become well known in Swedish modernism, and later in the office of Schmidt and Aichinger. In 1928 he was appointed the architect in charge of Behrens Vienna office where he designed and supervised important works such as the tobacco factory in Linz, Austria. At this time he also commenced studies in Art History at the Vienna University graduating as a Doctor of Philosophy in 1933 with a thesis entitled \\"Origins and Development of Concrete Construction\\". In 1935 Karl established his own practice in Vienna. Dr. Gertrude Langer inspecting a local art show, Brisbane, 1940 Gertrude Froeschel was born in Vienna in 1908. She commenced study in the History of Art at Vienna University in 1926 being taught by Professor Josef Strzygowski and later attended lectures by Henri Focillon at the Sorbonne. In 1932 she married a fellow student Karl Langer graduating the following year on the same night as he with a Doctorate of Philosophy in Art History. In 1938 with the annexation of Austria by the Third Reich, Gertrude who was Jewish, and Karl left Vienna and travelled via Athens to Australia. Karl and Gertrude arrived in Sydney in May 1939 proceeding to Brisbane in July so that Karl could commence work for architects Cook and Kerrison. From the time of their arrival until their deaths the Langers dedicated themselves to a great variety of civic and professional activities. Their combined efforts greatly influenced the development of the arts and design in Queensland especially through such organisations as the Queensland Art Gallery Society, the Australian Council for the Arts and the Vacation Schools of Creative Art in which they fulfilled key roles over many years. Karl became well known throughout Australia shortly after his arrival when his appointment to the position of Assistant Town Planner with the Brisbane City Council in 1944 resulted in a Parliamentary Enquiry. The primary cause for complaint was the appointment of an \\"enemy alien\\" over a returned soldier. The outcome of this enquiry found that Karl Langer was an individual whose talent and experience clearly distinguished him as the most suitable applicant. He was still prevented from taking up the position, as Queensland Railways, his employer, refused to release him invoking wartime manpower regulations. He remained in the service of the Queensland Railways until 1946 when he left to establish his architectural and planning practice in Brisbane. He worked throughout Australia and was the initiator of many influential urban design ideas such as the site for the Sydney Opera House and the pedestrianisation of Queen Street. He was the designer of buildings such as: * the Main Roads Building at Spring Hill * Chapel of St Peter's Lutheran College at Indooroopilly * Lennons Broadbeach Hotel on the Gold Coast and worked in the regional centres of Queensland as an architect, town planner and landscape architect. Karl lectured at the University of Queensland and the Queensland Institute of Technology in design, town planning and landscape architecture. Research carried out when he first arrived in Brisbane pioneered the field of climatic design and resulted in 1944 in the publication of an influential booklet called \\"Subtropical Housing\\". He was instrumental in establishing, and was the first president of the Brisbane division of the Australian Planning Institute and the Queensland Branch of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects and was a Fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. Gertrude was the art critic for The Courier Mail from 1953 until her death, her last review being published on the day she died, 19 September 1984. She was a foundation member of the International Association of Art Critics and was president of the Association's Australian Division from 1975 to 1978. Through her work with the Gallery Society and her personal donations of art works including drawings by Karl she exerted her influence on the collection of the Queensland Art Gallery. The house was sold to the present owner after the death of Gertrude Langer. Alterations were subsequently made to the interior and a third level was added.  Description  Upper storey, fence and river gum on the footpath, 2014 The house, a three storeyed masonry and timber structure, is located in a well known suburban street on a small rectangular block with a narrow frontage. The site is a south facing slope that falls steeply away from the street. In the space between the house and the footpath is a single storeyed garage, a covered access to the house and a small walled garden containing a fish pond. On the footpath in front of the house stand a very tall river gum. Concealed from the street behind the house is a mature rainforest garden. Rectangular in plan the house spans across the block with minimal setbacks from side boundaries. The walls are constructed of brickwork which has been rendered and painted, floors are built of timber and skillion roofs are sheeted in corrugated asbestos cement. Openings, primarily timber casement windows, are concentrated in the longer northern and southern elevations facilitating illumination and ventilation of the interior while maintaining privacy. The compact plan of the house ensures the maximum amount of garden space on the small site. The northern facade rises two storeys above the street. Windows on this elevation are protected by protruding window surrounds on the upper level and a masonry projection that forms an awning over ground level openings. A row of ventilator slots is located above the upper level windows. The main roof of the house, concealed behind the parapet wall on the northern elevation, has an overhang onto the roof terrace. Originally built on two levels, the house now has a third level which has been built into the former undercroft space. The front door of the house opens into an entrance hall containing a timber stair which now extends down to the added lower level. This middle level consists of open planned living spaces. Adjacent to the hall is the kitchen which opens onto a former dining area. A long room, originally divided by a timber screen into living area and study, extends across the back of the house with a fireplace on the eastern end. Timber framed double doors open from the hallway into the long room. The internal timber panelling has been removed and the fireplace, originally exposed brickwork, has been bagged and painted. The upper level consists of two small bedrooms, a bathroom and a large roof terrace which overlooks the densely planted rear garden. The roof terrace is accessed from the landing at the top of the stairs through double timber doors. Built-in cupboards in the principal bedroom have been painted. A wardrobe designed by Karl Langer remains in the smaller bedroom. Doors which opened from the principal bedroom directly onto the terrace have been replaced with windows. The former Japanese garden has been altered by the increase to the height of the brick garden wall and the removal of the original planting.  Heritage listing  Langer House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. It is an excellent example of the invigorating contribution to Australian culture made by 20th century migrants. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Langer House at St Lucia survives as a fine example of the work of the important and influential architect Karl Langer. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Through the decorative restraint evident in the facade detailing and composition, and the efficient but spacious planning of the house, Langer introduced to Brisbane aesthetic ideals and social concerns drawn from his experience of European modernism. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. It is an inventive and pioneering solution to the problem of domestic design in Brisbane under post-Second World War building restrictions. Karl Langer's original observations of local climate and landscape led to the incorporation of climatic design principles and an innovative approach to garden design including experimental gardening in the Japanese style and the suburban rainforest garden. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The home of Gertrude and Karl Langer from 1950 until their deaths, the house and garden are the creation and embodiment of a partnership which had a significant impact on cultural life in Queensland.

Currently, Indonesia does not officially recognize Republic of China (Taiwan) as it adopted One-China Policy; officially recognizing only the People‚Äôs Republic of China since 1950. Despite geopolitical constraints, the relations between two countries remain flourished over times, the opportunities for widening and deepening the relations have grown.  History  Ethnically and linguistically indigenous peoples of Taiwan and native Indonesians are related, as both belong to Austronesian ancestry. The \\"out of Taiwan theory\\", suggests that the Austronesian-speaking people ‚Äî the ancestors of Indonesians ‚Äî came from Taiwan during the \\"Austronesian Expansion\\" which began 4,000‚Äì5,000 years ago. Nevertheless, the question of origin and ancestry of present-day Austronesian-speaking populations remains controversial. Prior to the Independence of Indonesia, during Dutch East Indies era in early 20th century, Republic of China has reached out to people of the Indies, especially towards Overseas Chinese. Back in 1900, the socio-religious organization Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan (), also known as the Chinese Association, was founded in the East Indies. Their goal was to urge ethnic Chinese in the Indies to support the revolutionary movement in mainland China. The 1912 founding of the Republic of China coincided with a growing Chinese-nationalist movement within the Indies. At that times, numbers of Chinese Indonesians has dual citizenship and often still shown their loyalty, oriented to Republic of China as their homeland. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence in 1945 and won recognition in 1949, Indonesia briefly recognized the Republic of China between period 1949 to 1950. However, after the defeat of National Revolutionary Army to People's Liberation Army, and its retreat to Taiwan, in 1950 Indonesia shifted its official recognition to People‚Äôs Republic of China and opted for One-China policy. In 1965, after a political turmoil in Indonesia that led to the fall of Sukarno and the rise of Suharto, the relations between Indonesia and Communist China worsened as the two nations severed diplomatic relations. However Indonesia did not re-establish diplomatic relations with Republic of China, despite sharing anti-communist sentiments at that time. Nevertheless, Indonesia and Taiwan enjoy close relations since the late 1960s. Indonesia has established an Indonesian Economic and Trade Office in Taipei since 1970, while Taiwan reciprocated by establishing Taipei Economic and Trade Office (TETO) in Jakarta since 1971. In October 2015, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the planned opening of the second TETO in Surabaya, East Java.http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=2816627 The office was officially opened on 18 December 2015 and started its operation on 21 December 2015.

This was the first memorial to Gurkha soldiers in the United Kingdom, and was occasioned by transfer of their headquarters and training centre from Hong Kong to London in 1997. The sculptor was Philip Jackson, working from a statue of 1924 by Richard Reginald Goulden in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the plinth was designed by Cecil Denny Highton. Two casts of Goulden's sculpture had previously been erected in locations in Nepal as World War I memorials to the Gurkhas, the first at Kunraghat in 1928 and the second at Birpur in 1930. The memorial in London is more than one and a half times the size of this model, so Jackson worked the figure up in his own style and from a living model, Captain Khemkumar Limbu.

A number of his works are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Early life in Austria Karl Langer was born in Vienna in 1903, where he lived until emigrating to Australia in 1939 with his wife Gertrude. Karl studied architecture in Vienna, most notably in the Master Class run by Peter Behrens, at the Viennese Academy graduating in 1926. During this time Karl worked in the office of Josef Frank, who was to become well known in Swedish modernism, and later in the office of Schmidt and Aichinger. In 1928 he was appointed the architect in charge of Behrens Vienna office, where he designed and supervised important works such as the tobacco factory in Linz, Austria. At this time he also commenced studies in Art History at the Vienna University, graduating as a Doctor of Philosophy in 1933 with a thesis entitled \\"Origins and Development of Concrete Construction\\". In 1935 Karl established his own practice in Vienna. Dr. Gertrude Langer inspecting a local art show, Brisbane, 1940 In 1932 he married a fellow student Gertrude Froeschel. They graduated the following year on the same night, with Doctorates of Philosophy in Art History. In 1938 with the annexation of Austria by the Third Reich, Gertrude, who was Jewish, and Karl left Vienna and traveled via Athens to Australia. Career in Australia Karl and Gertrude arrived in Sydney in May 1939 proceeding to Brisbane in July so that Karl could commence work for architects Cook and Kerrison. From the time of their arrival until their deaths the Langers dedicated themselves to a great variety of civic and professional activities. Their combined efforts greatly influenced the development of the arts and design in Queensland, especially through such organisations as the Queensland Art Gallery Society, the Australian Council for the Arts and the Vacation Schools of Creative Art in which they fulfilled key roles over many years. Karl became well known throughout Australia shortly after his arrival when his appointment to the position of Assistant Town Planner with the Brisbane City Council in 1944 resulted in a Parliamentary Enquiry. The primary cause for complaint was the appointment of an \\"alien refugee\\" over a returned soldier. The outcome of this enquiry found that Karl Langer was an individual whose talent and experience clearly distinguished him as the most suitable applicant. He was still prevented from taking up the position, as Queensland Railways, his employer, refused to release him invoking wartime manpower regulations. He remained in the service of the Queensland Railways until 1946 when he left to establish his architectural and planning practice in Brisbane. He worked throughout Australia and was the initiator of many influential urban design ideas such as the site for the Sydney Opera House and the pedestrianization of Queen Street. Karl lectured at the University of Queensland and the Queensland Institute of Technology in design, town planning and landscape architecture. Research carried out when he first arrived in Brisbane pioneered the field of climatic design and resulted in the 1944 publication of an influential booklet called \\"Subtropical Housing\\". He was instrumental in establishing, and was the first president of the Brisbane division of the Australian Planning Institute and the Queensland Branch of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects and was a Fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. Later life Karl Langer died in 1969. His funeral was held in the Chapel of St Peter's Lutheran College, Indooroopilly, which he had designed. He was cremated at the Mount Thompson Crematorium where he had constructed the East Chapel. Karl Langer's work was featured in the Hot Modernism exhibition at the State Library of Queensland in 2014. State Library of Queensland also holds a large number of his architectural plans. The University of Queensland Fryer Library holds 89 boxes and around 1800 of Langer's architectural plans. Works He was the designer of buildings, including: * the Main Roads Building at Spring Hill * St Peter's Lutheran College Chapel at Indooroopilly * his own home Langer House at St Lucia * Val Vallis' home in Twigg St, Indooroopilly * the Four Seasons Hotel * West's Furniture Showroom at Fortitude Valley (1952) and worked in the regional centres of Queensland as an architect, town planner and landscape architect, producing these works: * the assembly hall at Ipswich Girls Grammar School * St John's Lutheran Church at Bundaberg * Sugar Research Institute at Mackay * Lennons Broadbeach Hotel on the Gold Coast He also authored a number of books, including Sub-tropical housing, published in 1944 by the University of Queensland.

He was known for being very ugly, but was morally upright. He started his own school in the Yangtze River region, and became a major transmitter of Confucian thoughts. Confucius initially misjudged him because of his bad looks, but later expressed his regret. Life According to the Records of the Grand Historian, Tantai Mieming (Ziyu) was born in 512 BC, 39 years younger than Confucius, but the Kongzi Jiayu says he was 49 years younger. He was born in Wucheng (Wu City) in the State of Lu, Confucius' native state. Tantai was known for being exceedingly ugly, and Confucius considered him untalented because of his bad looks, but he proved to be a morally upright person. After graduating from the school of Confucius, he moved south to the Yangtze River region and started his own school with 300 students. He became an important transmitter of Confucian thoughts, and was famous among the rulers of states. When Confucius learned of Ziyu's success, he remorsefully said: \\"I used to judge a person by his speech and erred in Zai Yu; I used to judge a person by his appearance and erred in Ziyu.\\" Honours and memorials In Confucian temples, Tantai Mieming's spirit tablet is placed in the outer court, beyond those of the Four Assessors and Twelve Wise Ones. During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong posthumously awarded Tantai Mieming the nobility title of Count of Jiang (Ê±ü‰ºØ). During the Song dynasty, he was further awarded the title of Marquis of Jinxiang (ÈáëÈÑâ‰æØ). According to the Tang dynasty historian Sima Zhen in his Shiji Suoyin, the Tantai (Dantai) Lake () southeast of Suzhou is named after Tantai Mieming. There is a Tantai Mieming tomb (ÊæπÂè∞ÊªÖÊòéÂ¢ì) in Nanchang, Jiangxi province, on the campus of Nanchang No. 2 High School.

In the United States, doctrine about use of force is primarily defined by the individual states, although there have been some Supreme Court decisions of limited scope. Missouri's legal experts have said the use of force laws in Missouri are considered more officer-friendly than that in other states. Such laws have come under national scrutiny in the wake of the shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. Current law governing use of force is specified in Missouri Revised Statutes chapter 563,Missouri General Assembly (1977). \\"L. S.B. 60 Effective 1-01-79‚ÄîLaw enforcement officer's use of force in making an arrest\\". Missouri Revised Statutes Ch. 563 Defense of Justification ¬ß 046 r. 2. which differ substantially from the laws of neighboring states.  Background  = Use of force = In the course of their duties, law enforcement personnel use force to subdue suspects. The use of force consists of two parts: the amount of force that may lawfully be used on a continuum that includes deadly force; and the circumstances under which it may be used, including the level of imminent threat reasonably perceived by the member of law enforcement and the concern that a fleeing felon may harm the public. Doctrines are intended to balance security needs with ethical concerns for the rights and well-being of intruders or suspects. In the event that members of the public are injured, this may give rise to issues of self-defense as a justification. In the event of death during a reasonable use of force, this may be legally considered a justifiable homicide. The application of excessive force is considered Police brutality. = Use of force national guidelines = State police in the United States are generally given considerable leeway in making the decision about the amount of force needed to save themselves or others. While there is no national definition, the United States Supreme Court has created legal standards for use of force through two key decisions. \\"Objective reasonableness\\" is a concept from the 1985 Tennessee v. Garner decision that stated that police officers could not shoot at a fleeing suspect simply to prevent their escape but only if the suspect posed a significant threat of death or serious harm to the community. In the 1989 decision of Graham v. Connor, the court ruled that \\"the reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, and its calculus must embody an allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation.\\" Current local and state doctrines vary in defining these decisions and are tested in civil lawsuits and criminal prosecutions on a case-by-case basis. If a case where the use of force has been applied unevenly based on a suspect's race, sex, disability, religion, or national origin, the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice is empowered to bring charges for breaking Federal law governing civil rights. When the Department of Justice investigates a pattern of use of force abuses, it can work with a state or agency to create new policies that align with national law and precedent.  Missouri doctrine  Law enforcement agencies in Missouri exist at the town, county, and state levels and are subject to national guidelines, state laws, and applicable local or county policies. Use of force doctrine is defined in Missouri by state law as well as local policy. From the 1860s, when Missouri became a state, until the 1960s, individual states wrote their own codes, often using common law as a basis. In 1962, the Model Penal Code was published with recommendations to modernize and standardize penal law and criminal law nationally.Sanford H. Kadish, \\"Codifiers of the Criminal Law: Wechsler's Predecessors\\", 78 Columbia Law Review 1098 (v.78, n.5, June 1978) and Monrad G. Paulsen and Sanford H. Kadish, \\"Criminal Law and Its Processes\\" , 77 Harvard Law Review 790 (v.77, n.4, February 1964) The code served and continues to serve as a basis for the replacement of existing criminal codes in over two-thirds of the states. Missouri did not incorporate the recommendations. The statutes concerning use of force in Missouri included the stipulation that police officers could use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect of a felony including the event that the felony was not of a violent nature, such as a crime against property. In 1977, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit struck down these statutes in Mattis v. R Schnarr. The court found that the Missouri statute authorizing the use of deadly force by police attempting to arrest any fleeing felon was unconstitutional as \\"an arbitrary imposition of death\\" and violation of due process. In Tennessee v. Garner, Justice White wrote for the Majority opinion addressing the legal issue as whether the totality of the circumstances justified the deadly force. Because it deprives the suspect of his life, White concluded that deadly force should be applied only when there is a \\"reasonable suspicion\\" that a suspect is armed or dangerous. The legal concept derives from a prior decision in Terry v. Ohio (1968) where court recognized law enforcement's right to stop a possible suspect for a brief time and take additional steps to investigate further. For the Court in Berkemer v. McCarty 468 U.S. 420 (1984), Justice Marshall wrote :\\"the usual traffic stop is more analogous to a so-called 'Terry stop,' see Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)\\" (468 U.S. at 439) In 1989, Graham v. Connor, a similar finding was held; \\"\\"the reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, and its calculus must embody an allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation.\\" Although Missouri statute still stated that law enforcement could use force including deadly force on any suspect that \\"has attempted to commit or has committed a felony,\\" the concept of reasonableness was included. \\"...An officer may only use deadly force as permitted by other justifications such a self defense or when he reasonably believes that such use of deadly force is immediately necessary to effect the arrest and also reasonably believes that the person to be arrested a)Has committed or attempted to commit a felony; or b) Is attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon; or c) May otherwise endanger life or inflict serious physical injury unless arrested without delay.\\" Investigation into possible use of force violation is first conducted internally. A state prosecutor can also apply to judge or grand jury to decide whether there is enough evidence to pursue a prosecution. The application of the standard is interpreted by a jury in criminal cases.

Jo So-ang (Ï°∞ÏÜåÏïô, 30 April 1887 - 10 September 1958) was a politician and an educator in Korea under Japanese rule. He participated in the Korean independence movement. He participated in drawing up a draft of the proclamation of the independence of Korea in 1918 while he was studying in Japan, and after 1919, worked for the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea as the secretary of the provisional government and head of the Korean Independence Party. He also organized the society of policies on current affairs with Kim Gu and Yeo Unhyeong, contributing to establish the theories on diplomacy of the provisional government. In the political scene of liberated Korea, he was one of the right politicians, who stuck to the legitimacy of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. In 1948, he visited Pyongyang to attend the joint conference of leaders of parties and social groups in the entire nation with Kim Gu and Kim Gyusik, which was turned out to be a failure. He abandoned his direction for North-South Korea's cooperation, leading to one- sided establishment of Republic of Korea in favor. He ran for a representative of the national assembly and was elected in 1950. In the same year when the Korean war broke out, he was abducted and taken to North Korea. Role in the Independence Movement =Diplomatic Activity= Jo So-ang served roles in the national government, the political structure of the Provisional Government, and in public relations. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was established on April 13, 1919, following the March 1st movement. The interim government resisted Japan‚Äôs colonial rule of Korea and supported the Korean independence movement. In the midst of dividing political alliances, Jo So-ang remained loyal to the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea and was elected as their secretary and diplomatic correspondent. Making him in charge of the interim government‚Äôs remittances, propaganda, and public relations work. In May 1919, Jo traveled to Europe in order to attend the International Socialist Conference to appeal international support and recognition for South Korea's independence movement. In March 1921, after attending the Communist Party Congress in Moscow, Russia, he returned to Beijing with critical views on communism. Jo would incorporate his views and experience with communism when writing his political theories and teachings. =Legislative Activity= In 1930, based on his ‚Äúprinciple of three-equalities‚Äù Jo So-ang wrote up a draft establishing what is renowned as a national and social democracy. He argued that in order to achieve social democracy, equality between individuals, equality between ethnicities, as well as the equality between nations must be attained. Following this principle, he suggested that to acquire equality amongst individuals it must be through immediate political equality such as free and equal elections. Next, in his theory, he advocated for the equality between ethnicities. Equality between ethnicities would be achieved through equal economic developments and equal educational opportunities. For the betterment of the nation as a whole, Jo so- ang presumed that the political system should be based on a parliamentary democracy in which the execution of the assimilation of lands, production of facilities/institutions, along with a mandated educational regime should be held at the expense of the socio-economic system. In 1941, not long after the ‚Äúthree equality theory‚Äù was accepted by the Korean Provisional Government, the theory became known as the ‚ÄúFundamental Governing of National Reconstruction‚Äù. Not only did his theories guide the Korean Independence Party during the occupation, but also served as the main foundations of legislation for the country post-liberation.

It was established by Chen Ming-Ji (Èô≥ÊòéÂêâ) in 1929. In 1997, after Mr. Chen‚Äôs death, his third son, Chen Sheng-Fu (Èô≥ÂãùÁ¶è), took over this traditional industry. History Chen Ming-Jin, the founder of Ming Hwa Yuan, was born in , in Japanese Formosa (modern Checheng, Pingtung County, Taiwan). He started Ming Hwa troupe, the predecessor of Ming Hwa Yuan, with Tsai Bin-Hwa (Ëî°ÁÇ≥ËèØ), as proprietor of theater. In the early stage, the Japanese rulers allowed the local customs to develop without much interference and Taiwanese opera continue to thrive. After the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese government implemented a K≈çminka policy that encouraged Japanization. During this period (1937-1945), the Japanese government prohibited the public performance of Taiwanese opera. However, Ming Hwa troupe was one of the few groups that were allowed to perform. Taiwanese people were also strongly encouraged to speak the Japanese language, wear Japanese clothing, etc., which obstructed the development of Taiwanese opera. In 1945, Taiwan was handed over to the Kuomintang-led Republic of China. Taiwanese opera was rejuvenated and became fashionable in Taiwan. In 1949, there were over 500 registered troupes. However, the American Westerns and Japanese Samurai movies blitzed the Taiwanese film market in the 1960s, which made the Taiwanese opera‚Äôs box office flop. After experiencing the rise and fall of Taiwanese opera, Ming Hwa Yuan has not only absorbed social trends, but has innovated the art by integrating the elements of modern theater and cinema. In 1982, they won the first prize of the National Theater Competition in Taiwan by the opera ‚ÄúFather and Son,‚Äù becoming an instant hit. Organization Ming Hwa Yuan is a family- owned troupe, managed by the family members. Under the general organization of Ming Hwa Yuan, there are eight sub groups, Tien, Di, Shuan, Hwang, Jer, Yue, Sin and Chan. Feature In spite of performing the traditional Taiwanese opera for almost a century, Ming Hwa Yuan is featured by the particularly contemporary stage design such as lightning and sound effects, which are similar to a large-scale live concert or contemporary theater performance. In other words, it emphasizes not only sound but also visual presentation, helping the audience understand the story. Going through a series of reformation and innovation, Ming Hwa Yuan creates a unique and avant-garde performing style by mixing traditional heritage and modern technique. It has been praised as the ‚ÄúBroadway of the East‚Äù due to its distinctive presentation of Taiwanese opera, consisting by the folklore, poem-lyrics, theater, dancing, music, acrobatics, and fine art.

It was designed by Karl Langer and built in 1967 by Cyril Porter Hornick. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 June 2014.  History  The former Main Roads Department Building was built in 1967 to accommodate, consolidate, and modernise the department during a period of extensive expansion and upgrade of Queensland's road network. It housed the department until 2012. Designed by important Modernist architect, Dr Karl Langer, the substantial office building is an excellent, intact illustration of his commercial work and is a good representative example of a mid-twentieth century highrise. In the early 1960s the Main Roads Department (MRD) faced a major task in modernising Queensland's road network. Prior to this, the department saw itself only as a rural roads authority responsible for the provision and maintenance of main roads connecting Queensland settlements. The decentralised nature of Queensland, with its scattered population and small tax base for local governments, was not conducive to systematic road building, and until the mid-twentieth century railways dominated long-distance transport. Although the Queensland Government was responsible for main roads and roads on Crown Lands open for selection, elsewhere local authorities had to finance their own roads; or where there were no local authorities, local landholders could form road trusts and receive government grants. Queensland's road system developed in a piecemeal fashion until 1920 and even after it remained a secondary government spending priority to railways, which spread rapidly in the early twentieth century to service agricultural areas. Although railways were the priority, the rise of the motor car increased the need for an expanded and improved road network. The Queensland Main Roads Act 1920 provided for responsibility for roads and bridges to be shared between state and local authorities. The mission of the Main Roads Board, formed by this Act, was to develop a cohesive network of \\"main roads\\" partly funded by the state. Local authorities would fund half the cost, and would be the construction and maintenance authorities where possible. The priority for road construction was to join towns not linked by railways; to link farming areas to existing railways; and to build developmental roads to open Crown Lands for closer settlement. The interwar period saw a massive increase in car registrations and the revision of the Main Roads Act. By mid-1923 nearly 17,000 cars were registered in Queensland (rising to nearly 92,000 by 1934). As more people took to the car, the need for serviceable roads for motor vehicles became apparent. The Main Roads Acts Amendment Act 1925 abolished the Main Roads Board and formed the Main Roads Commission (MRC), and the board was replaced by John Robert Kemp (formerly the Board's Chairman) as the Commissioner. World War II (WWII) also stimulated road building efforts. During the war the MRC carried out a wide range of defence works, mostly for, and under the direction of, the Allied Works Council (AWC). Although the MRC increased its equipment during the war years, after WWII it faced resource shortages and a continued rise in car ownership, plus demands to seal more of the state's roads with bitumen. After WWII, roads increasingly competed directly with railways. Vehicle numbers rose from 129,126 in 1945 to over 282,594 by 1954. By 1960, Australia was second only to the United States in terms of car ownership per head of population. In 1951, the MRC became the MRD. The MRD was responsible for the planning, survey and construction of state highways and of main, developmental, secondary, mining access, farmers' roads, and tourist roads and tracks, as well as bridges and related works. The department was under an increasing work load, brought about by the \\"explosion\\" in vehicle ownership and Queensland's buoyant economic expansion. The MRD's Annual Report of 1955 noted that \\"Queensland is passing out of the earlier phase of road construction ... just sufficient to keep traffic moving. The State has entered a second phase where construction must provide for the traffic of to-day and the traffic of to-morrow in such a way that roads and bridges will carry in safety bigger volumes of traffic, comprising vehicles which move much faster and carry much more heavier loads...\\". The push for a new head office for the MRD started around 1955. In December that year the Main Roads Commissioner, AR Williams, wrote to the Minister for Transport, Jack Duggan, advising that at no stage the MRD ever had a building designed and constructed for them. Williams stated that the MRD did not have close contact with the public, apart from registration, and \\"Motor vehicle registration activities require that the location be ... away from the heavily trafficked streets\\". Other requirements included garaging for departmental vehicles and a full size basement for record storage. Prior to the construction of their new building at Spring Hill, the MRD was accommodated in buildings \\"scattered throughout the city\\". The intention of the new building was to provide better working facilities and amenities for an increasing staff in an efficient and productive environment. The department was performing a major role with private industry and commerce in Queensland's development and the new building would reflect this. Not only would it be an impressive place for people to register their vehicles, it would be the co- ordinating centre for the planning, survey, design and construction work of the MRD. The Queensland Government acquired 16 allotments, totalling almost one hectare, at the corner of Boundary and Fortescue Streets, Spring Hill, between 1959 and 1961. At the time this area comprised primarily older detached housing. In June 1959 Leo John Michael Feenaghty, Secretary of the MRD, wrote to Brisbane-based, private architect and town planner Dr Karl Langer, confirming that the government had decided to retain him as the architect for the new head office building. Langer's earliest designs for the MRD's \\"New Head Office Building\\" date to late 1959 with at least eight further iterations between 1959 and 1963. Early designs were discussed with the Acting Government Architect, Edward James Archibald Weller, at the Department of Public Works Architectural Branch in September 1959. Although generally satisfied, Weller was concerned that the building would \\"include some features that will set a precedent and to that extent will have an effect upon provision in Government Buildings generally\\". Born in Vienna in 1903, Langer had studied at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts and in 1928 he was employed by pioneer German Modernist designer Peter Behrens to run his Vienna office. In 1933 Langer was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy for his thesis \\"Origins and Development of Concrete Construction\\". In 1939 Langer immigrated to Australia with his wife, (Dr) Gertrude Langer, bringing direct experience of the European Modern Movement to Queensland. He gained temporary employment with architects Cook and Kerrison in Brisbane and from 1940 Langer lectured part- time in architecture and architectural design at The University of Queensland, publishing Sub-Tropical Housing in 1944. This booklet explored issues related to modern house design and town planning in a sub-tropical climate and influenced many Australian architects working in the post-WWII era. Modernist architecture developed in pre-World War I Europe and gained popularity in Australia post-WWII. It is notable for a rationalisation of planning, emphasising clarity and simplicity of form and detailing. American and Scandinavian influences were strong in the style's employment in Australia. From 1945 Langer was employed as an assistant town planner in the Brisbane City Council and also was commissioned to work on a range of town planning projects for Darwin, Ingham, Toowoomba, Yeppoon, Kingaroy, Mount Isa, and Mackay, and for the National Capital Development Commission, Canberra. Concurrently, he completed a wide variety of architectural projects including small, economical domestic work and large commercial and institutional work. Influenced by classical Greek and contemporary Modernist architecture, Langer developed a sophisticated hybrid of classical and modern design principles. With his civic designs, Langer explored the idea of the conjunction of landmark and landscape and his designs typically incorporated a harmonious setting for the architecture. Inspired by Queensland's flora, fauna and climate, his designs worked with the context in complementary ways and his work on climatic design in architecture has been called \\"pioneering\\". Fundamental to his designs, he sited buildings and outdoor spaces for optimum orientation, ensured interiors had high levels of natural daylighting and ventilation, and incorporated gardens of Australian plants for the occupation and enjoyment of the users. His designs were typified by modern, highly functional spaces that were fit for purpose, yet, had a degree of flexibility of use. Langer set new standards for design in Queensland. The work of the MRD was a major influence on the shaping and development of Queensland settlements, especially Brisbane, and also on the increasing prosperity of the state during the second half of the twentieth century. In January 1960 (Sir) Charles Barton was appointed Commissioner of Main Roads. Barton made a major push to modernise the existing road network into an extensive metropolitan highway and intercity freeway network and to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of the department. Based on studies by leading transport specialists following American precedents, the department drafted and implemented long term programs of road upgrades and freeway construction. These programs expanded and the department grew to become a primary division of the Queensland Government with considerable authority. On 1 July 1963 the first Road Plan of Queensland, a 20-year plan to build and upgrade roads to ensure no town was too far from a declared main road, encouraging social and economic development of rural areas, came into effect. The plan was visionary and required a well-organised and highly functional department. Further road planning was facilitated by Queensland Government transport studies for major centres in the 1960s and early 1970s. The Brisbane Transportation Study, jointly commissioned in 1964 by the MRD and the Brisbane City Council, and undertaken by American transport planners Wilbur Smith and Associates, recommended a series of freeways, expressways and bridges, although only some of these were built. Under Barton, the MRD was also reshaped. Through operational and attitudinal changes he introduced a \\"private sector\\" business mode to achieve efficiency. He also increased decentralisation, appointing an Assistant Commissioner and Divisional Engineer each at Townsville, Rockhampton and Brisbane, and a Divisional Engineer at Toowoomba. Site preparation for the new MRD head office at Spring Hill began on 15 July 1963. Approximately 15,300 cubic metres of earth was excavated and a reinforced concrete retaining wall up to nine metres high was built around three sides of the excavation to create a level platform on the sloping site. The government decided that Brisbane architect Colin Tesch would be responsible for construction documentation and administration of the contract. In June 1964 Queensland's State Government Insurance Office (SGIO) agreed to purchase the land from the MRD, pay for construction, and then lease the building back to the MRD for a 40-year term. CP Hornick & Son Pty Ltd, the largest privately owned construction company in Queensland at the time, constructed the building. To deal with the MRD's ongoing accommodation shortage during construction of its new head office, a nearby partially erected building on Dickens Street was purchased and completed to MRD requirements, for occupation in late 1965. Construction of the new head office commenced in July 1965. By this time the number of vehicles registered in Queensland had risen from 363,878 in 1958, to 541,198 in 1965. To deal with this rise in vehicle registrations, the counter section of the new head office was designed to have ten times more public space than the old Albert Street office. Langer's design for the MRD building, the largest of his career, expressed his architectural principles. He described it as being a \\"sculptural\\" landmark. Others described at the time as vast and imposing. Yet, he employed techniques so that it would \\"fit\\" within its context, including stepping the building back from its boundaries so that it would not cast shadow onto the adjacent allotments and not overwhelm them with its scale, an extensive landscaping treatment around the building, and a 'delightful' screen of custom-designed breeze blocks facing Wedd Street to conceal the basement car park. The building included an expansive public forecourt on Boundary Street, a typical characteristic of Langer's work. Approximately wide by long, it included lawns, gardens with Australian plants, and a large pond with fountain jets to cool the surrounding air. Langer envisioned the forecourt as an important public space for visitors to Spring Hill and to the building. A recurrent inclusion in Langer's works, the building featured a modern allusion to a classical, grand colonnade at the primary entrance. Across the width of the ground floor and encompassing the ground and first floors, the rhythmic verticals and lintel of the concrete structural frame was expressed, smooth finished and painted white, contrasting with the dark glazing adjacent. The building's structure and materials were modern, rational, and \\"honest\\", consistent with Langer's principles. The structure comprised a grid of concrete columns supporting concrete floor slabs, freeing the floor plan from loadbearing partitions, which maximised the flexibility of interior layouts. The vertical circulation, toilets and shower rooms, tea rooms, and other shared facilities were grouped in a central core. In this way, the floor plan was sensible and efficient and was repeated up the building. Principal materials were self-finishing, expressing their inherent character and beauty, with a noticeable use of Queensland-sourced materials for a \\"natural\\", decorative effect. Where practical, Langer eliminated suspended ceilings from the design. Langer typically exploited passive lighting and ventilation in intelligent and uncomplicated ways and for the MRD building he included simple methods to achieve this. Parallel to the street, the long, narrow plan form (approximately ) was oriented with its long sides facing north-east and south-west. These elevations were highly glazed, comprising a grid of large, double-glazed, operable windows. A critical requirement for the drafting work of the department, this created interiors that were naturally well lit and well insulated, and allowed passive ventilation. The glazing was sheltered by a projecting \\"egg-crate\\" of concrete. The northern side had a deeper projection to block direct sun, reducing heat gain and glare. The west and east elevations were predominantly windowless to occlude the harsh, low sun and were built of concrete to provide a thermal mass quality. In contrast, the photographic and computational spaces that required highly controlled light and ventilation conditions were located in the basement levels, which had deep floor plans and limited fenestration. An upturn in the city's economy and a modernising of the building codes that included a removal of building height limits in 1964 saw a considerable increase in the construction of highrise office buildings in Brisbane. Between 1950 and 1965 few office highrise buildings were constructed in Brisbane. These included: Mutual Life & Citizens (MLC) Insurance Building (1955); Friendly Society Building (1957), and the Taxation Building (1961). However, by the middle of 1964, 20 highrise office buildings were in the course of construction in the Brisbane CBD. The number of buildings constructed between 1965 and the end of 1970 far exceeded the previous 15 years. These included: Pearl Assurance Building, Eagle Towers, and Commonwealth Savings Bank Building (1966); Manufacturers Mutual Insurance (MMI) Building, and Main Roads Department Building (1967); Temperance & General (T&G;) Insurance Building (1969), and; Westpac Bank Building, and Mount Isa Mines (MIM) Building (1970). Highrise office buildings designed and constructed between and are a specific type of architecture that evolved under particular circumstances. The type clearly represents the excitement, prosperity, and vision of Australia and indicates the economic rationalism and progress in the period. Indicating their status, they were often ceremoniously opened by important dignitaries. In cities nationally and internationally, Modernist architects were unencumbered by traditions when designing this new type, challenging aesthetic and symbolic values, and the provision of public and private amenity. Their impact was unprecedented and it was not until critical analysis of tall buildings in the late 1960s that the approach to highrise development changed. Designed in a time when Australia was little concerned about the ethics of energy consumption, typical highrises exploited this abundance. Orientation and shading was generally dismissed and windows were inoperable, relying on mechanical air-conditioning. Floor plates were vast, relying on artificial light. However, some architects designed intelligent buildings that were connected to the traditions of architecture and were better attuned to their environment. Sophisticated in its design, Langer's MRD Building is representative of the better designs in Queensland of the period. The principal characteristics of highrise office buildings designed and constructed in the 1950s and 1960s are: remarkable height to footprint ratio; an expressive and all-encompassing Modernist aesthetic; reinforced concrete construction; a \\"glamorous\\" treatment of the ground floor/primary entry; an urban, public space used as setting for the building; rationalisation and repetition of the floor plan; and integration of state-of-the-art office technology and staff facilities. The new head office for the Main Roads Department possessed these principal characteristics. The tall building comprised three large basement levels, a generously proportioned ground level with a mezzanine, a tower of nine levels, and a roof-level caretaker's flat. The building had a huge gross floor area of 33,000 square metres and upon completion was the largest reinforced concrete office building in Queensland. The principal public function of the building, vehicle registration, occupied the ground and mezzanine floors within impressive, robust, and dramatic spaces. The double-height main reception area was well-lit through \\"immense\\" glazing onto the forecourt and featured striking marble, timber, and terrazzo surfaces. Artworks commissioned for the building were prominently displayed. Designed as a showplace for the Queensland Government, the building and grounds were floodlit at night. As well as occupying pre-existing buildings, the Queensland Government constructed purpose-built buildings to accommodate its administration and departmental offices in Brisbane. These buildings were reflective of the circumstances of the government and illustrate its operations over time. The Main Roads Department building was purpose-designed, accommodating the Main Roads Department's diverse uses in repetitive and rationalised floor plates. Although offices and administration areas comprised the majority, the building also included: basement car parking; food facilities for the staff - a large cafeteria with kitchen, kiosk for snacks, and lunch room; staff training facilities - a large, double-height auditorium with the latest projection equipment; a technical and recreation library; a room for displaying models of major Main Roads projects, and; a large air- conditioning plant and a caretaker's flat. The building was designed to incorporate modern office technology. The department's technical and commercial electronic data processing divisions were accommodated in the basement, including their state of the art computer, the largest in Queensland at the time. The computer was serviced by a special, independent air- conditioning system, designed to keep the computer room at a constant temperature and humidity, with the heat generated by the computer absorbed by the ornamental ponds at the front of the building. A system of vacuum message tubes connected all sections of the building and there were telephones and a master clock system, CCTV, a teleprinter system, a Xerox machine, and a dumbwaiter for the movement of files between floors. The building was completed in August 1967. In September the MRD moved more than 1250 personnel, from eight offices, into its new $4.5 million head office. The building was officially opened on 6 November 1967 by Frank Nicklin, Premier of Queensland, who stated that \\"this new building, with its modern appointments, the latest business equipment - including a computer - research and design facilities, will greatly enhance the department's work and its world-class reputation\\". The new head office was commended at the time. It featured in the 7 September 1967 edition of The Queensland Master Builder, which detailed the building's construction techniques and highlighted its modern technology. According to the MRD's magazine Queensland Roads, there were hopes \\"that the construction of this building with its landscaped gardens and surroundings in the old Spring Hill area of Brisbane, [would] provide an incentive for other businesses and developers to follow the example of the Main Roads Department\\". Commissioner Barton viewed the MRD as \\"a giant consulting engineers and construction organisation\\", and stated \\"why should a department like Main Roads be any different from private business ... [W]e hope that when our officers are dealing with people they will get the idea that we are here to do business just as efficiently and effectively as anybody else in the community\\". The Courier-Mail added that \\"the building design, layout of office space and staff facilities, gives the Main Roads Department an air of big business, not the traditional Government department organisation\\", while the Mines and Main Roads Minister, Ronald Ernest Camm, claimed that the new building \\"would be one of the most effective ways of organising Main Roads personnel and facilities for a bolder attack on the problems of the future\\". The new \\"luxury\\" head office was only part of the MRD's building program. By the end of the 1960s the department had also constructed new buildings to accommodate its new regional offices in Rockhampton, Cloncurry, Barcaldine, Toowoomba, Mackay, and Warwick, which had responsibility over their local main roads. In the artwork Communications by important Queensland sculptor, Leonard Shillam, was installed at the MRD building in Spring Hill. It was commissioned for the building in 1968, made in cast aluminium over painted concrete, and depicted a bas relief map with a rural area and urban area connected by a road. Langer died in 1969. As an architect and town planner, he had a pronounced impact upon the built environment of Australia, especially in Queensland. Having a deep belief in community responsibilities, particularly in cultural matters, he had been active in the Royal Australian Institute of Architects; first president (1952) of the Queensland division of the Royal Australian Planning Institute; a founder and chairman (1966‚Äì68) of the Queensland Association of Landscape Architects; and a member (1963‚Äì69) of the National Trust of Queensland. Important examples of his architectural work include the Langer residence at St Lucia (1950); Mackay Sugar Research Institute (1953); Lennon's Hotel Broadbeach (1957, demolished) and Lennon's Hotel Toowoomba (1957); St John's Lutheran Church, Bundaberg (1960); Kingaroy Town Hall and Civic Square (1963); Assembly Hall at Ipswich Girls' Grammar School (1964); and St Peter's Lutheran College Chapel, Indooroopilly (1968). He was responsible for notable urban ideas of the 1950s and 1960s, including choosing the sites of the Sydney Opera House and the Australian Parliament House; the pedestrian shopping mall in Queen Street, Brisbane; and the first canal development of the Gold Coast. After his death, both The University of Queensland and The Queensland Institute (later University) of Technology with the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects established annual student prizes in memoriam. His body of work is a clearly distinguishable exploration of a sub-tropical modernism and is important in the evolution of Queensland architecture, with Langer described as \\"arguably the most influential architect of the 1950s\\". From the head office, the MRD administered its important work. Motor vehicle ownership continued to rise and the highway network in Queensland was expanded substantially in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s and 2000s the department's work became more sophisticated to cope with increased traffic. By the end of the 2010s the department was responsible for the state's largest built community asset - the Queensland state- controlled road network, worth over $46 billion and carrying more than 85% of the state's traffic. Examples of major main roads projects co-ordinated from the head office include: the Southeast Freeway (1972), the Beef Roads and Developmental Roads schemes of the 1970s, the Bald Hills to Burpengary Deviation of the Bruce Highway (1977) and many subsequent upgrades and extensions of the highway, the Gateway Arterial Road and Bridge (1986), and the Pacific Motorway (2000). Over time the head office building was altered. In the fountain jets of the forecourt pond were altered to stacked boulder waterfalls. The building was also altered internally to accommodate different office fit-outs. In 2006 the forecourt of the building was remodelled to a design by architects, BAC Group to provide building code compliant pedestrian access to the front entrance. This work included replacement of the original awning with a modern, steel and glass awning, adding two concrete ramps to the entrance bridge, altering the forecourt gardens and ponds, and installing the sculpture The Red Cube at the front of the building. While the building was being painted in 2007 it was identified approximately 6% of the render on the northern sun hoods needed repair. The hoods were investigated by structural engineers, no sign of structural distress was identified, and trial repairs of the render were undertaken in 2008. In March 2009 the MRD merged with Queensland Transport to form the Department of Transport and Main Roads, which continued the control of the state's main roads. In 2012 the department vacated the MRD building. The building was sold to Asian Pacific Group Pty Ltd in December 2013 for $22 million. After a three year renovation, it opened on 16 September 2016 as The Johnson, a mixed-use property containing a signature Art Series boutique hotel, residential apartments, serviced offices, with rooftop pool and terrace, and adjoining restaurant, bar and caf√©.  Description  The former Main Roads Department Building is a 15-storey, reinforced concrete office building in a Modernist style that stands on a prominent site on Boundary Road, Spring Hill, Brisbane. Totalling almost one hectare, the rectangular site is bounded by Boundary Street to the south, Fortescue Street to the east, and Wedd Street to the north. Small-scale commercial and residential development adjoins the western boundary. The sloping terrain is terraced into large, flat platforms by concrete retaining walls. As well as a landscaped garden setting, the building comprises: a front portico; tower; service core; rear podium; and rear carpark. The building structure is a reinforced concrete grid of concrete columns supporting concrete floor slabs. The building retains design elements characteristic of the work of its architect, Dr Karl Langer, such as: employing a hybrid of subtle Classical allusions and Modernist architectural devices including a forecourt and stylised colonnade front; simplified forms, decoration and spatial arrangements; a restrained use of high-quality materials; and careful siting and manipulation of form to achieve optimum orientation for natural light and ventilation. The garden forecourt is a flat public space fronting Boundary Street. The garden is laid out in sharp and dynamic lines of concrete, defining contrasting flat areas of mature trees, grass, paths and water to create a bold, abstract effect. A wide entrance path from the street bisects the garden, bridging across a pond and stepping up to the front portico entrance. The Red Cube, a large metal sculpture, stands on the path in front of a marble slab engraved to commemorate the opening of the building. The western garden is terraced into level areas, retained by concrete walls and linked with concrete stairs. It retains the original abstract layout and also contains mature trees, shrubs, grassed areas and original concrete benches. The eastern garden is narrow and defined by a series of terraced boulder retaining beds and also retains original concrete benches. The front portico is a rectangular block attached to the tower that, on approach, gives the impression of a grand colonnade across the width of a tall ground floor. This is formed by a rhythmic series of white, smooth-rendered, rectangular concrete columns topped by a low parapet. This is in-filled with large panels of dark aluminium-framed inoperable glazing. The main elevation is symmetrical except for the entrance doors, which are placed off-centre. The windowless side elevations (east and west) of the portico are pale yellow facebrick walls in stretcher bond. The portico has a concealed flat roof clad with metal rib and pan sheeting. The tower is the major component of the building, comprising 14 levels (B3 to L10) and a rooftop plant room and caretaker's flat (L11). The tower is a tall, narrow, rectangular block with a concealed timber-framed hipped roof clad with metal pan and rib sheeting. It is oriented with its long sides (the front and rear) facing north and south. These elevations are highly glazed with an external grid of white-painted, concrete sun hoods forming a shading \\"egg crate\\". The hoods on the northern side project further than the south. The windows are large, double glazed aluminium framed casements and have spandrel panels inset with a chunky, white quartz aggregate. The window hardware has been removed from the sashes. The side (eastern and western) elevations are painted concrete, finely articulated with off-form-patterned panels. Largely windowless in comparison to the north and south, the eastern and western elevations have four columns of small, square aluminium-framed windows with opaque glass. The service core projects from the rear (northern side) of the tower with walls of painted concrete with off-form-patterned panels. The core fenestration is minimal, contrasting with the ample glazing of the adjacent northern elevation of the tower. The east and west elevations of the core have long, narrow ribbons of windows with high sills, and the north elevation has a column of small windows with a high sill and a spandrel panel of quartz aggregate. On the roof of the service core and the tower is a large, facebrick plant room and air-conditioning machinery. Abutting the northern side of the tower is the rectangular rear podium, which stretches the width of the building and comprises four levels (G, B1, B2, and B3) and a roof top deck (L1). The side elevations are pale yellow facebrick in stretcher bond with rhythmically placed square windows. The northern elevation has an egg crate of white-painted, concrete sun hoods sheltering large, aluminium-framed windows. The windows have spandrel panels featuring dark slates. The rear carpark stands behind the rear podium, accessed from the lowest level of the building (B3) and from Wedd Street at the rear. It is one-storey with a flat, steel-framed roof clad with metal pan and rib sheeting, pierced by large, rhythmic openings to the sky. A decorative lattice wall of painted concrete breezeblocks lines the Wedd Street boundary, screening the car park. Internally, the former functions of the building are clearly defined, with public entry and reception in the front portico; offices in the tower; vertical circulation, toilets, and other shared facilities in the core; offices and a semi-enclosed carpark in the rear podium; and car parks and store rooms in the rear car park. The public entry and double-height reception area are intact and feature black and white terrazzo floors, and marble-clad walls, columns, reception desk, planterbox and window sills. An original wall- mounted bronze artwork depicting the historical evolution of the wheel is retained in the entrance foyer. Within the front portico, L1 is a mezzanine level retaining original balustrades: iron near the southern glazing and battened timber above the reception area. Mounted on the end wall of the lift foyer facing the front entrance is Communications, a large artwork by Leonard Shillam. The tower levels (L1 - L9) each comprise long, open floor plans with later lightweight partitions. Window sills are black terrazzo. Small services cores bookend each floor, on the east and west sides of the tower. These contain fire stairs, service risers, store rooms, and kitchenettes. Some levels retain original black bean veneer fire doors. The top level of the tower (L10) contains two large auditoriums. The larger of the two, named the Charles Barton Auditorium, is double-height and has a raised stage with a proscenium arch, velvet curtains, wings spaces either side, and a backstage area with changing rooms. Under the stage is a storage area accessed via original, battened timber doors. The auditoriums are serviced by a single projection room on a mezzanine between the rooms, accessed via a narrow timber stair. On the roof of the tower is a caretaker's flat, accessed via a narrow concrete stair. It is a modest, timber-framed, three-bedroomed apartment, concealed behind the tower parapet and sheltered under the main roof. It has pale yellow facebrick walls and aluminium-framed windows with original hardware (sliding and double-hung sashes). The front door addresses a generous, north-facing, roofed patio area, paved with square concrete pavers. The layout of the flat is original; however, all ceiling linings have been removed. The kitchen, bathroom, and laundry fitouts are early and it retains early electric monitor boards used by the caretaker to supervise the building. The service core contains service risers and shared facilities, including lifts, a fire stair, dumb waiter for office files, tearooms, and large toilet and shower rooms. The fire stair in the service core retains original finishes, including black and white terrazzo stair treads and risers, black- painted metal balustrades with black plastic handrails, textured stair undersides, and vinyl tile clad walls with contrasting inset floor numerals. The rear podium levels (B3 - G) each comprise large, open floor plans with later lightweight partitions. Window sills are black terrazzo. Early floodlights survive mounted to the exterior of the building. Elements that are not of cultural heritage include: the building's ramps, awning, and doors at the main entrance portico; lightweight partitions and suspended ceilings throughout; kitchen and store room fitouts; and steel shelters of the garden and roof deck. The former Main Roads Department Building stands prominently on a ridge of the folding terrain of Spring Hill. It is highly visible from the surrounding suburbs and has extensive views from the office spaces within. The gardens and open spaces are conspicuous within the immediate streetscape and contribute to the character of the area.  Heritage listing  The former Department of Main Roads Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 June 2014 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Main Roads Department Building (1967) is important in demonstrating the Queensland Government's response to the rise in mass motoring in the second half of the twentieth century. Purpose-built to consolidate and modernise the department's activities associated with expanding and upgrading the state's road network, it was the largest reinforced concrete office building in Queensland at the time of its construction, illustrating the importance of Main Roads operations and contribution to the state's economic advancement. The place is also important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland architecture as a good, intact example of a substantial, architect- designed building in a Modernist style adapted to suit local conditions. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is a good, intact and representative example of the work of architect, Dr Karl Langer, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of his work. Most notably, it: displays a hybrid of subtle Classical allusions and Modernist architectural devices including a forecourt and stylised colonnade front; features characteristic simplified forms, decoration and spatial arrangements and a restrained use of high-quality materials; is sited and its form is manipulated for optimum orientation for natural light and ventilation of the interior, and; is designed to be fit for purpose. As the largest commission of his career, it is a rare illustration of Langer's principles applied on a large scale. The place is a good, intact and representative example of a mid- twentieth century highrise office building in Queensland. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of this type, including: notable height to footprint ratio; expressive and all-encompassing Modernist aesthetic; reinforced concrete construction; refined treatment of the ground floor/primary entry; urban, public space used as setting for the building; rationalisation and repetition of the floor plan; and integration of state-of- the-art office technology and staff facilities. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Notable for its landmark attributes and expressive architectural qualities, the place is important for its aesthetic significance. The former Main Roads Department Building is highly visible from the surrounding suburb and maintains an imposing streetscape presence. Modernist in style, the building's simplified sculptural form is distinguished through a variety of treatments, including off-form textured concrete, stone spandrel panels, facebrick, egg-crate screening and breeze blocks. The abstract, graphic layout of the forecourt and side gardens, including pond and entrance bridge, and; the use of high-quality Queensland materials and artworks in the public reception areas complete the design. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Designed to accommodate the department and to express its work, the place has a strong and special association with the Main Roads Department, which had a crucial influence on the economic and social development of Queensland during the twentieth century. It served as the head office for the department for 45 years.

According to the Mimamsakas a complete ' (‡§Ö‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§∞‡§£‡§Æ‡•ç) i.e. main, relation or connection, consists of ' (‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§É) - the subject or the matter to be explained, ' (‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡§Ø) or ' (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∂‡§Ø) - the doubt or the question arising upon that matter, ' (‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§™‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑) ‚Äì the prima facie argument concerning it, ' (‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑) or siddhanta (‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§) ‚Äì the answer or the demonstrated conclusion, and sangati (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡§§‡§ø) ‚Äì pertinency or relevancy or the final conclusion. According to Srimad Bhagavatam (XI.ix.29), ' or the objects of sense enjoyment are to be found everywhere, as ' ('food'), ' ('sleep'), ' ('fear - overcoming of') and ' ('mating' meaning sensuous pleasures). Meaning ' (Sanskrit:‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§É) means ‚Äì material contamination, possessing as objectives, on the subject matter, objects for sense enjoyments, subject matter, sense objects, the objects of sense gratification, objects of sense enjoyment. In the Bhagavad Gita, this word is used twice in its plural form ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§æ (') while referring to - on the subject matter in Sloka II.45 ‚Äì ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•à‡§ó‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡§æ and to the objects for sense enjoyment in Sloka II.59 ‚Äì ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•á. Vi≈õayah primarily means ‚Äì the sphere of influence or activity, and also refers to ‚Äì dominion, kingdom, territory, country, abode, lands etc. The word ' is derived from ' meaning to act. Application Anandavardhana defines ' as 'habitat', area, sphere or genre; Abhinavagupta defines it as a particular aggregate ('). In Sanskrit Literature, it refers to the area or range of operation, or objects operated upon, and therefore means the area in which the words can serve any purpose as informing us of anything and includes their expressed, indicated, and suggested meanings (objects) and also the facts that can be inferred from using words. In his ', Shankara has used ' to mean - 'the field of experience' ‚Äì ‡§∂‡•ã‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§É ‡§∂‡§¨‡•ç‡§¶ ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡§£‡§Æ‡•ç (of the ear/ the field of experience/ is receiving sound). And, in Sloka 79 of his Vivekachudamani , he has used this word to denote virulent 'sense-objects' ‚Äì ‡§¶‡•ã‡§∑‡•á‡§£ ‡§§‡•Ä‡§µ‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§É ‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡§æ‡§¶‡§™‡§ø that a sense-object is more virulent than the poison of a king cobra. In the Abhidharma Buddhist texts, the term , which are five kinds of sensory objects or (sense-fields), refers to the object that is directly and intentionally known but DignƒÅga, in connection with (objects of cognition), has shown that can also refer to non-intentional objects. ' also refers to the area or range of words, including their meanings. The ' gives ' as one of the many meanings of the Sanskrit word ‚Äì ' (‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§•); ' as ' is defined as that which floats in apprehension (') or that which is manifested in apprehension. 'The object', 'the meaning of the word' and 'purpose' are the three philosophical relevants. In Sanskrit compositions there has always been an unmarked arrangement or word order; in the traditional word order the subject is followed by object with gerund and infinitives in between and the finite verb in the final position. An illusion is wrong perception owing to avidya (ignorance), in which case conditions of veridical experience do not obtain; the locus (') does not figure as any objectivity or content ('), it looks as if it is superimposed. The sky is not a perceivable content and therefore, it is never presented as a ' and is not capable of being the vi≈õayah of any perceptual judgment. Shankara speaks of adhyasa ('illicit superimposition') of the vi≈õayah ('not-self') and its properties on the ' or the pure self. In the notion ‚Äì \\"I know this\\" ‚Äì the cognitive activity of the knower relates to ' ('object'), and to the Self; the Self reveal itself in the result and in the ' as the ' through the instrumentality of the experiencing of '. Significance In the phrase ‚Äì ', ' means - experienced, apprehended or perceived, and ' means ‚Äì any object in relation to a human experience i.e. in relation to perceptive knowledge or intuitive knowledge, and is that towards which the mind is directed. All six ' (orthodox) schools of Hindu Thought, which had developed simultaneously, accept the authority of the Vedas and have given us the dynamic interpretations of the classical texts. The interpretations are not arbitrary and the Mimamsikas speak about ' or the procedure of interpretation that consists of five steps ‚Äì the first step is ' or the subject of interpretation capable of having two or more meanings, the second step is ' or doubt regarding its meaning, the third step is p≈´rva-paksƒÅ or postulation of some probable meaning, the fourth step is ' or the refutation of the suggested meaning and the fifth step is ' or establishment of true meaning. Sriram ≈öastrƒ´ in his PancapƒÅdikavivaranam (1st varnaka) reminds us that - \\"All things are objects (') of witness-consciousness, on account of their being either known or unknown\\". Both, \\"this\\" and \\"I\\", are indexicals, non-conceptually referring to the unique reality, both are ', and both combine to commit , therefore, ' refers to all universal concepts, descriptive words and general meanings. Madhus≈´dana Sarasvatƒ´ adopting the theory promoted by Sarvaj√±ƒÅtma Muni, the author of Samk≈õepa-≈õƒÅrƒ´rika and who had got this idea from PrakƒÅ≈õƒÅtma Yati‚Äôs Vivarana, explains that Brahman is both 'locus' (') and the 'object' (') of '.

A German nobleman who entered the Russian service after first serving in France, he went on to command troops in many of the Empire's wars during the reign of Catherine the Great.  Biography  Born in Kleve and descended from a family of , Johann was the son of Baron Kaspar von Elmpt (died 1730), and after receiving his initial education in his native town, he entered the service of the French Army. In 1749 he transferred into the Russian army at the rank of captain. He quickly advanced through the ranks, being promoted to Colonel on 25 December 1755. Elmpt distinguished himself during the Prussian Campaigns of the Seven Years' War. He was appointed a brigadier, and then made a major-general on 2 April 1762. He served as quartermaster general for the field army, and performed a number of vital staff responsibilities, including the drawing up of military maps for Livonia and Courland, including plans for field camps and troop dispositions throughout the region. In 1763 he was awarded the Order of Saint Anna. With the formation of a field army in Glukhov under Pyotr Rumyantsev in 1768 to fight the Turks, Elmpt was made part of its command staff, but he transferred to another field army the following year. In September 1769, Elmpt and Mikhail Kamensky under orders from Alexander Mikhailovich Golitsyn, crossed a large force of Grenadier regiments over the Dniester river to assault the fortress at Khotyn, leading to a battle that decimated the Turkish forces there. Later Elmpt participated in the seizure of Ia»ôi, and commanded a special detachment of the main army stationed on the Dniester and Bug River. He was rewarded for these feats with the Order of Alexander Nevsky and a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. In 1772 Elmpt was a major commander of troops against the Bar Confederation, later commanding a corps guarding the borders with Sweden. Promoted yet again to full General in 1780, he would serve as commander of the Russian 3rd Division in the Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì1792). Elmpt's tense relationship with his Austrian counterpart General Gabriel von Spl√©nyi created problems in the military operations between the two armies. Rumyantsev intervened and made Elmpt give command of his division over to Major General Ernst Salignac. Elmpt returned to Riga claiming poor health. In 1790 Elmpt was rewarded with the dignity of a Reichsgraf (Imperial Count) of the Holy Roman Empire, an honor that was confirmed in the Russian peerage in December of that same year. With the ascension of Tsar Paul, Elmpt found his military career revived. He was given command of all army forces stationed in the Livonian Military Division based out of Riga, his rank was adjusted to that of General of Infantry, and he was given the honorary position of Chief of the prestigious Saint Petersburg Grenadier Regiment, rechristened under his own name. On the day of Paul's formal coronation (5 April 1797), Elmpt was awarded the dual high honors of the Order of St. Andrew and promotion to the rank of Field Marshal. On 10 January 1798 Field Marshal Elmpt was discharged from military service due to his advanced age, but was permitted the privilege to continue to wear his army uniform in public. He died four years later at Svitene Manor on his estate in what is today southern Latvia. His son Philipp was bethrothed to Suvorov's only daughter Natalie; but she broke off the engagement. As Philipp had no male issue, the title of Count von Elmpt was inherited by his son-in-law Joseph Carl von Anrep.

Echinocereus rigidissimus grows to a height of up to 30 cm, and a width of 11 cm when mature, with pectinate radial spines curved slightly towards the stem, the new spines are initially reddish to magenta and fades to a yellow or light pink colour when they mature. Echinocereus rigidissimus, flowers in flushes throughout the spring season, with multiple buds borne atop the plant from younger areoles, the flowers are bright pink in colour with a white coloured throat. If pollination is successful, Echinocereus rigidissimus forms circular shaped, greenish to dark purplish fruit, with white flesh and dark brown to black seeds approximately 3 months after flowering. Since it rarely offsets, Echinocereus rigidissimus is propagated by seed.  Habitat  Echinocereus rigidissimus natural habitat is distributed abundantly throughout Chihuahua and Sonora in Mexico, as well as in the United States in Arizona and New Mexico. It grows at elevation from 1200 to 2000 metres above sea level (Blum et al. 1998) This cactus prefers south facing slopes and is rarely seen on flat ground. It prefers the 1500 meter elevation. Plants are fire resistant from small grass fires but cannot tolerate hotter fires. With perfect habitat, these plants have been seen growing up to 45 centimeters in height. A 2018 measurement of one plant in the Santa Catalina mountains showed a height of 48 centimeters, a record. Flowering occurs from late April to early June depending on the elevation and spring heat. These plants will not flower when stressed but lack of flowering is rare. Their habitat has been negatively affected by cattle, cactus collectors and off road vehicles. These plants are becoming less common in southern Arizona.(S.A. Rasmussen 2018)  Cultivation  Echinocereus rigidissimus requires porous soil as it is sensitive to overwatering. It prefers a soil with plenty of stones with little organic material to ensure that it dries as quickly as possible. Echinocereus rigidissimus requires full sun to part shade during its active growing season from spring though to early autumn, as well as adequate air circulation to reduce the chance of rotting. In winter abstain from watering Echinocereus rigidisimmus and keep the soil mixture dry, as it helps encourage flowering in the spring season. Echinocereus rigidissimus is hardy to temperatures of ‚àí12 ¬∞C. References [3] (S.A.

It was designed by Karl Langer and built in 1968 by W. W. Groom. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 December 2012.  History  The Chapel of St Peter's Lutheran College built in 1968, was designed by architect, Dr Karl Langer as the centrepiece of the school grounds, complete with a tree-lined plaza, forecourt, bell tower, and reflecting pool. The chapel is used regularly by the school and the local Lutheran parish for liturgical and general assembly purposes and remains central to the school community. The area now known as Indooroopilly was surveyed in 1858 and first settled in 1860. The area was subdivided into farms and later into residential allotments. Prior to 1870 there were few houses built in the area but settlement of the district received impetus from the opening of the Brisbane to Ipswich railway in 1875. During the 1880s and 1890s Indooroopilly developed as a fashionable suburb. Many substantial, architect-designed residences were built on large allotments. Indoocombe was a large brick house built in Indooroopilly in . It became the home of the Munro family who renamed it Ross Roy and the house and its substantial grounds became a centre of high society life. Photographs from this time show the grounds immediately surrounding the house to be landscaped and well maintained and the remainder of the property being native growth with a cleared and grassed understorey. The Munros lived at Ross Roy until their deaths. After the finalisation of the estate, Ross Roy was sold to the Lutheran Church in December 1944 for .Livingstone, Tess (ed), Upon This Rock Focus Publishing: Double Bay NSW 1995 p. 20. The villa occupied and was established as St Peter's Lutheran College opening 25 February 1945. Lutheranism is a major branch of Christianity and places a strong emphasis on education. In 1838 the first Lutherans arrived in Australia from Prussia and established communities in South Australia and Moreton Bay. That year a group of German Lutheran and Presbyterian missionaries established Zion Hill (at present day Nundah), a mission for Christianising aborigines, on the outskirts of Moreton Bay Penal Colony. It was not considered successful and was abandoned in 1848. In 1857 Lutheran Pastor Carl Franz Alexander Schirmeister came to Moreton Bay and established congregations at Brisbane CDB, South Brisbane, Ipswich, and Toowoomba. He obtained Government grants of land for church use and the first church was built in North Brisbane in 1861, followed quickly by churches at the other locations. Over the following decades Lutheranism was spread across Queensland. Around 1859 the newly formed colony of Queensland launched a vigorous immigration policy that continued for over 40 years.Harrison, Jennifer. The People of Queensland, 1859-1900: where did the Immigrants come from? in Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland Vol XIII, No. 6 May 1988. p. 189. It attracted many Germans who formed distinct communities amidst the essentially-British nation. Although only a minority of these Germans were Lutheran, across the state Lutheran congregations grew and some established Lutheran schools. With the introduction of the state school system at the turn of the century, Queensland Lutheran schools disappeared as the state school system grew. By 1914 there were no operational Lutheran schools in Queensland and a period of low activity of Lutheran education followed during the interwar and World War II (WWII) period partly due to anti-German sentiment. A gradual resurgence of independent schools began in the last half of the twentieth century with government financial assistance in the late 1960s. This resulted in a Lutheran school boom in Australia between the 1970s and the 1990s and in 2012 Queensland had 27 Lutheran schools educating over 20,000 students. This resurgence of Lutheran schools in Queensland started in 1945 with the establishment of St Peter's Lutheran College at Indooroopilly. The Courier Mail described it as \\"the first Lutheran secondary school in Queensland\\".The Courier-Mail, 16 Nov, 1944. p. 3. The school was co-educational and attendance was open to boarders and day school children of all denominations. The school was intended to be a northern adjunct and feeder to Australian Lutheran College#Immanuel Seminary in Adelaide where they would be prepared to serve as pastors and in other ministries. On opening day the school received in donations, ear-marked for the addition of a chapel. A Chapel Fund was established and fundraising activities began. In February 1948 a temporary chapel was dedicated in a former officers' mess building of the Australian Women's Army Service camp. The AWAS camp had occupied part of the Munro estate and the school moved the mess building to the centre of the school campus. In September 1948 the school completed Luther House, a two storey building of classrooms. The upper storey temporarily housed the chapel until a permanent chapel could be built. The 1950s and 1960s was an era of religious vitality in Australia. During this period the nation was in a sustained economic boom, was led by conservative governments, and was experiencing high population growth. The congregations of major religions expanded and church attendance and religious society membership rose with accompanying financial improvement.Hilliard, David. A Church on Every Hill: Religion in Brisbane in the 1950s. Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, 14 6: Brisbane, Qld: Royal Historical Society of Queensland, 1991, p. 256. Suburban churches regularly reported record congregation attendances for major holy days. Membership of the Lutheran church also increased after WWII with the major influx of European migrants. In the early to mid 1960s a number of the major Christian religions altered the way they ministered to their congregation in order to re-establish themselves within the modern world. With increased incomes, increased congregations, and an increasingly modern approach, considerable building programs began. Spacious brick churches were built in a modern style, often replacing smaller timber churches.Hilliard, David. A Church on Every Hill: Religion in Brisbane in the 1950s. Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, 14 6: Brisbane, Qld: Royal Historical Society of Queensland, 1991, p. 257. In 1966 the Chapel Fund had raised $59,995 and borrowed $70,000 for the construction of the chapel. Brisbane-based architect and town planner Dr Karl Langer was engaged as architect. Dr Karl Langer, Brisbane, 1950 Dr Karl Langer (1903-1969) was born on 28 July 1903 in Vienna, Austria. He studied at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts under the directorship of pioneer German modernist designer Peter Behrens and in 1928, the year of his graduation, he was employed by Behrens to run his office in Vienna. In 1933 he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy for his thesis entitled Origins and Development of Concrete Construction. Dr Langer immigrated to Australia with his wife, Dr Gertrude Langer, in 1939, bringing direct experience of the European Modern Movement to Queensland. He gained temporary employment with architects Cook and Kerrison in Brisbane and from 1940 Dr Langer lectured part-time in architecture and architectural design at the University of Queensland, publishing Sub-Tropical Housing in 1944. This booklet explored issues related to house design and town planning in a sub- tropical climate and influenced many architects working in the post-WWII era.Wilson, Andrew (ed.), Hayes & Scott post-war houses. St Lucia, Qld: UQP, 2005. p. 5. In 1944 Dr Langer was employed as an assistant town planner in the Brisbane City Council. From 1945, he was commissioned to work on a range of town planning projects for Darwin, Ingham, Toowoomba, Yeppoon, Kingaroy, Mount Isa, Mackay and for the National Capital Development Commission, Canberra. Concurrently, he completed numerous architectural projects of a wide variety including small, economical domestic work and large commercial and institutional work. As an architect and town planner, Dr Langer had a pronounced impact upon the built environment of Australia, especially in Queensland, from the 1940s until his death in 1969. Along with numerous cultural pursuits, he was active in the Royal Australian Institute of Architects; first president (1952) of the Queensland division of the Royal Australian Planning Institute; a founder and chairman (1966‚Äì68) of the Queensland Association of Landscape Architects; and a member (1963‚Äì69) of the National Trust of Queensland. Important examples of his architectural work include the Langer residence at St Lucia (1950); Sugar Research Institute at Mackay (1953); St John's Lutheran Church, Bundaberg (1960); Kingaroy Town Hall and Civic Square (1963); Assembly Hall at Ipswich Girls' Grammar School (1964); Main Roads Building at Spring Hill (1966); Lennon's Hotel at Broadbeach (1957); and Lennon's Hotel Toowoomba. His body of work is a clearly distinguishable exploration of a sub-tropical modernism that culminates in the Chapel of St Peter's Lutheran College, Indooroopilly, his last built work. Modernism developed in pre-World War I Europe and gained popularity in Australia post-WWII. It was more than a design style and is notable for a rationalising of planning emphasising clarity and simplicity of form and detailing.Apperley, Richard, Robert Irving, Peter Reynolds, A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, p. 281. American and Scandinavian influences were strong in Australia.O'Callaghan, Judith, The Australian Interior: The Importance of Being Contemporary in The Australian Dream: Design of the Fifties, p. 172. During the 1950s and 1960s a similar rationalisation occurred within Christian religions in an effort to modernise approaches to religious practice. Churches became brighter and simpler in form and decorative treatments. They used new materials and forms while incorporating many traditional elements and symbols. Design responses included variations on the medieval church with simple massing, a rectangular nave stripped of apses, aisles and chapels, a dramatically lit sanctuary rear wall and simple belltower. The very tall bell tower, 2014 Influenced by the architecture of classical Greece and the modernist ideas of contemporary European architecture, Dr Langer developed a sophisticated hybrid of classical and modern principles of design bridging modern and traditional architecture.Sinnamon, Ian, Karl Langer in Queensland (paper presented to the Society of Architectural Historians Australia and New Zealand Conference on Modernism, Perth, 1993. Typically, Dr Langer explored the idea of the conjunction of landscape and landmark and his designs often involve a designed landscape incorporating the building. At St Peter's, Dr Langer proposed a fan- shaped chapel with a very tall bell tower and a round concrete reflecting pool behind a paved forecourt at the end of a tree lined plaza. The front of the chapel was a crisp, curved colonnade-a stylised temple front-clad in marble. The other walls were yellow face brick with a projecting pattern of crosses on the east wall exterior. Langer's design for the Chapel of St Peter's Lutheran College was in a modernist style and typical of his architectural concepts. Langer's exploration of modernism was heavily influenced by context. He studied the local fauna and flora in Queensland and the climate and his work interprets this in a Modernist manner. Dr Langer integrated native planting into his schemes; at St Peter's he proposed hedges of lemon scented tea trees for the plaza. He typically exploited passive lighting and ventilation in intelligent and uncomplicated ways; at St Peter's his design includes simple methods of passive ventilation and a naturally lit interior. By 1966 when the design of the chapel was nearing completion, Dr Langer had a strong connection with the Lutheran community of Queensland and with St Peter's Lutheran College. He had previously designed and had constructed St John's Lutheran Church, Bundaberg (1960) and St John's Lutheran Church, Ipswich (1961). At St Peter's College, he had completed a chaplain's residence (1954), a dormitory block (1954-55), a dining hall block (1966), and a concrete footbridge (1966‚Äì67). The dormitory block and a sandstone monolith was a memorial to Queensland Lutheran servicemen killed in WWII. The monolith was a gift by Langer to the school and, at the time, was believed to be the largest stone in Brisbane. A cross was carved on one side with servicemen's name son the other. Langer went on to complete a science block (1967‚Äì68) and the entrance fence and gates (1968). The plaza and forecourt connected some of these buildings in a coherent, ordered manner, e.g. the stylised temple fronted dining hall addressed the plaza and forecourt, referencing classical Greek town centres, suggesting Dr Langer had a masterplan for the site. In lectures for architecture students at the University of Queensland he referenced the design of St Peter's chapel and its context (the forecourt/plaza and surrounding buildings) as an example of applying the European model of a functional town square to the College campus.Discussion with Professor William Curnow, 11 October 2012 Importantly, the design was symbolic of the essence of Lutheran education-an axis with theology (the chapel) at one end and learning (the library) at the other. Dr Langer carefully incorporated Christian symbolism within the design of the chapel. The fan shape concentrates the gaze to the altar; lights are hidden from the nave to remove any distraction from this focus. The curved east wall is plain and dominated by the Cross (a symbol of the resurrection), seemingly floating in a strong light symbolising the rising sun. References to the Holy Trinity can be seen in the altar (constructed of three pieces), the three-finned bell tower and the three windows in the mediation chapel. Tenders for the construction of the chapel were called in February 1967. Local contractor WW Groom's tender of $123,938 (the lowest of nine) was accepted on 6 February 1967. Groom had also won the contracts for other Langer buildings at St Peter's. The foundation stone was laid 17 September 1967 and the chapel was opened and dedicated 14 June 1968 with Dr M Lohe, President General of the Lutheran Church, as guest speaker. Dr Langer and Groom attended and were involved in the ceremony. A large timber crucifix was commissioned for the wall within the small round room of the meditation chapel. It was carved by Alfred Schubert, a Czech-born woodcarver from Melbourne who had trained in Bavaria. Schubert had previously carved a crucifix for Langer's St John's Lutheran Church at Bundaberg. The crucifix was dramatically lit and loomed large within the room. Chapel bell, 2014 The chapel bell was donated by Pastor Franz Finger who was closely associated with the establishment of St Peter's and in its ongoing ministry and served on the College Council. Dr Langer died in 1969 and his funeral service was conducted at the chapel. It has been said that Dr Langer considered the chapel to be his favourite building.Sinnamon, Ian, \\"Langer, Karl (1903-1969)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/langer-karl-10783/text19123, accessed 26 March 2012. He was cremated at Mt Thompson Crematorium, where he had designed the east chapel built in 1962. There has been little alteration to the chapel over time. Aluminium blade sun shades have been added to some windows and the crucifix in the mediation chapel has been removed. The reflecting pond in the forecourt has been removed. A wide concrete ramp has been added in the forecourt probably replacing a wide stair. At some time, the large sandstone WWII memorial monolith was moved from its earlier position on the northern side of the boys' dormitory to the southern edge of the chapel forecourt. The chapel has been the only local Lutheran church in Indooroopilly since 1968 and services for the Lutheran parish are conducted weekly. The chapel, forecourt and plaza have acted as the physical and spiritual centre of the campus and continue to do so. The chapel is regularly used as an auditorium for the College and hosts performances, ceremonies and general assemblies. Larger assemblies and ANZAC day commemorations are held in the forecourt.  Description  Building side, 2014 The Chapel of St Peter's Lutheran College, Indooroopilly, is a fan-shaped building with a bell tower and large concrete paved forecourt terminating a tree-lined plaza. The plaza runs generally from west to east along a high ridge of land within the College campus. The tall bell tower is surmounted by a cross which can be seen from across the area. The gently-curved temple front entrance faces west. Three concrete steps lead up to a tall portico running across the face of the building. Four slender square columns divide the front into five bays. The portico is clad with marble presenting a high-quality face to the building that glows strikingly in the setting sun. At the southern end of the front a tall bell tower made of three concrete fins squats over a small round drum of the meditation chapel, attached to the building by a slender covered corridor. The bell is mounted at the base of the tower and has raised letters, \\"ST. PETERS 1967\\". The rear wall of the portico reveals the concrete structure infilled with panels of yellow face brick. The portico ceiling is lined with dark-stained timber battens. Aluminium-framed glass doors open from the portico into the chapel. High level aluminium framed awning windows light the interior choir loft. The north and south elevations are yellow face brick and comprise a series of stepped blade walls with west-facing windows. Secondary entrances to the nave are located along both sides and the low form of the vestry and consultation rooms project out of the south face. The eastern (rear) elevation has no windows and the field of yellow face bricks features a pattern of crosses made of projecting header bricks. The land falls away at the rear and long and narrow openings provide ventilation into the understorey and then up into the chapel via floor louvers behind the altar. The nave is a wide fan narrowing to the altar at the east end. The floor slopes down to the altar. The wide balcony choir loft is tiered and overhangs the entire west end of the nave forming a low-ceilinged entry zone supported on slender square concrete columns. The balcony balustrade is dark-stained timber battens and forms a sweeping curve. The balcony is reached via timber stairs at both ends of the entry area. The body of the chapel is a large space, brightly lit and uncluttered. The high white ceiling curves seamlessly into the east wall behind the altar where a large timber cross that appears to float on the white field is mounted. The north and south walls are yellow face brick and the windows are positioned so they are shielded from the nave and their light is directed eastward onto the altar. The pews are darkly-stained timber and are crafted to sit on the sloping floor, progressively shorter towards the altar to suit the reducing width of the nave. The floor of the nave is clear finished timber under the pews and russet-coloured carpet in the entry, aisles and sanctuary. The sanctuary is reached by two steps and a third step supports the altar. The altar is made of large thick slabs of Helidon sandstone with the front carved with the Greek letters alpha and omega. At the southern end a short stair leads down to a narrow, low-ceilinged corridor into the round meditation chapel. The floors of the corridor and meditation chapel are paved with glazed dark bricks and the walls are of yellow bricks. The ceiling of the meditation chapel is rough textured stucco. A large timber cross is fixed to the wall and the room contains timber kneelers and pews. Three long narrow windows light the small dark room. The chapel contains timber furniture, sandstone font, framed portraits, metal candlesticks and a variety of liturgical items. The forecourt is paved with concrete tiles in a stretched hexagonal pattern. It is approximately square. The plaza has a concrete surface and is flanked on both sides by grass planted with Poinciana trees at regular intervals. This outdoor furniture and other plantings are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. On the southern side of the forecourt is a World War II memorial, a large sandstone monolith, standing within garden beds and grass and flanked by two steel flagpoles. The stone is carved with a cross and a Roll of Honour listing Queensland Lutherans who died in WWII. This is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. A corner of Luther House and the cafe extension to the dining hall encroach into the forecourt and plaza. They are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  Chapel of St Peter's Lutheran College, Indooroopilly was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 December 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Chapel of St Peter's Lutheran College, Indooroopilly, constructed in 1968, is important in demonstrating the growth and changing practices of Christian liturgies in Queensland between the 1950s and the 1970s, in particular of the Lutheran church, a religious denomination of importance in Queensland since 1838. The chapel in its setting is a strong symbolic gesture embodying the essence of Lutheran education with theology (the chapel) visually linked to learning (the library). The chapel is important in demonstrating the strong influence of European modernist architecture in Queensland. As a highly intact modernist church, the chapel is important in representing modernist ecclesiastical architecture in Queensland during a period of significant re-evaluation and modernisation of Christian religions worldwide. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The chapel is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics and qualities of a modernist church in Queensland. Highly intact, the chapel is notable for incorporating a dominant bell tower, large, well-lit nave shaped to focus to the sanctuary, a choir loft, vestry and stark, dramatic meditation chapel. The Chapel is notable for its subtle incorporation of Christian symbolism including the positioning of the Cross floating on a strongly lit curving wall as a symbol of the rising sun and the use of three elements in the design of features like the bell tower, altar and meditation chapel. The place is an exceptional example of the work of architect, Dr Karl Langer, embodying architectural principles he developed and refined over his career. Most notably, it incorporates classical architectural devices including a processional plaza, forecourt and stylised temple front; features characteristic simplified forms and spatial arrangements and a restrained use of good quality materials; and incorporates natural light and ventilation. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Notable for its high quality design, materials and construction, the place is important for its aesthetic significance. The monumental bell tower is visible across the College and surrounding suburbs giving the chapel strong landmark qualities. The forecourt and plaza provide for views to and from the chapel, especially important for the symbolism in the visual link between the chapel and the library. The sculptural qualities of the austere chapel interior-including the seamless curving east wall with floating Cross; use of white plaster finishes complementing timber panelling and pale brickwork; natural lighting from the west facing clear glazing in the bladed side walls and from glazing in the west wall-evoke feelings of awe and reverence. The main chapel is a dramatic contrast to the cave-like small meditation chapel which evokes sensations of introspection and contemplation. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place, designed by Dr Karl Langer, has a special association with his life and work. It is the culmination of his architectural career and embodies the defining architectural principles he developed and employed. Dr Langer is an architect of importance to Queensland and was one of the earliest architects to promote a local variation of modernist architecture. His work, particularly on climatic design, inspired and influenced contemporary and later architects.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built around 1889. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005.  History  Tighnabruaich is situated in central Indooroopilly, overlooking the Brisbane River. The house was constructed around 1889 as the home of Henry Charles Stanley, the Chief Engineer for Railways in Queensland. It was designed by his own brother, Francis Drummond Greville Stanley, the former Queensland Colonial Architect. The name of the property evoked the village of the same name, in the Kyles of Bute, in Scotland where the brothers were born. The view of Chelmer, across the Brisbane, could occasionally be reminiscent of the other narrow waterway, its steep banks with lush vegetation and its steam-ferry traffic. =The undeveloped estate= The land on which Tighnabruaich is situated was once known as Portion 46, Parish of Indooroopilly. It was originally a 42-acre block with a frontage on the Brisbane River and was first sold, at government auction, on 27 September 1859. The original purchaser was James Henderson, but there is little evidence to suggest that Henderson either farmed, or otherwise developed, this land. In April 1873, the portion was transferred to Louis Stamm, a German-born Brisbane businessman who had pursued a wide-ranging career in Queensland since 1855. Stamm was variously a merchant, a newspaper proprietor and a brewery owner. Despite having been surveyed into farm allotments in 1858, prior to the original auction, central Indooroopilly did not attract agricultural settlement to the same extent as the surrounding river pockets: Fig Tree Pocket, Long Pocket and Indooroopilly Pocket, now known as St Lucia. The area was steeply ridged, covered in dense scrub and its steep river banks did not provide ready access to river transport, the principal means of communication and trade with Brisbane and Ipswich in the mid-19th century. Much of central Indooroopilly remained undeveloped and isolated until the arrival of the Brisbane to Ipswich Railway into the district, in the mid-1870s. =The impetus of the railway= By October 1873 the Queensland government had determined that the Brisbane to Ipswich railway would cross the Brisbane River at Indooroopilly. The rail corridor would pass through portion 46 and a railway station would be established on part of this portion. In that month a road ‚Äì Station Road or Indooroopilly Station Road ‚Äì was surveyed from Moggill Road to the site of the proposed Indooroopilly Railway Station. The segmentation of portion 46 was formalized on a survey plan dated March 1875. The railway corridor and the new road were transferred to the Queensland government the same year. Louis Stamm retained the remainder of portion 46 on 3 subdivisions. Another government road was duly built, along the eastern boundary of portion 46, and was named Musgrave Rd. Later, this would be renamed Clarence Rd. and would become the main access road for the new house of Tighnabruaich. In April 1875, the government decided to survey and connect this Musgrave Rd. (Clarence Rd.) to the road to Long Pocket, now Indooroopilly Rd. This connecting road was originally called the Indooroopilly Rd., but is now Lambert Rd. In June 1877, an extension westward of this new road was surveyed, cutting through portion 46, to connect the new settlements in the east of the district to Indooroopilly railway station. Indooroopilly railway station was opened, under that name, in 1875 and it was soon followed by the first railway bridge across the Brisbane River at Indooroopilly, in 1876. This provided a considerable impetus for closer residential settlement in the suburb and a small township developed around the railway station. By the late 1880s, this included a hotel, several shops and a carpenter. In the last quarter of the 19th century a number of fine villas were built along the banks of the Brisbane River, within reasonable proximity to the railway station. =The Stanley brothers= At some period prior to June 1891, Louis Stamm sold re-subdivision 3, of subdivision 1, to Henry Stanley. This was a block of nearly 9 acres, bounded by the railway line to the west, the Brisbane River to the south, Musgrave Road ‚Äì Clarence Road ‚Äì to the east and Indooroopilly Station Road ‚Äì Lambert Road ‚Äì to the north. This was the plot on which the house known as Tighnabruaich would be built. Henry Charles Stanley was born in Edinburgh in 1840. He studied engineering at Edinburgh University and subsequently worked as an engineer in Scotland before emigrating in the early 1860s to Queensland where he was employed as an assistant engineer on the construction of the colony's first railway, between Ipswich and Toowoomba. He was then employed as a railway engineer by the Queensland Government from 1 January 1866 and was appointed Chief Engineer for Railways in 1872. He held this position for nearly three decades, until 1901. Before his new house was built, Henry Stanley lived in the Toowong district, at Ascog in Church Street. Francis Drummond Greville Stanley was Henry's elder brother and the designer of the house. Francis was born in Edinburgh in 1839 and trained in Scotland as an architect. He emigrated to Brisbane in 1862 and practised privately before gaining employment with the Queensland government in the office of the Colonial Architect, Charles Tiffin, in 1863. Following Tiffin's retirement, Francis Stanley was himself appointed Colonial Architect, from 1 January 1872. He held the position until 1881, but throughout his period of government employment he accepted a number of private commissions. He also continued in private practice in Brisbane, Maryborough and Toowoomba after he left the public service. Stanley was a prolific architect and his work is found throughout Queensland. If house-design was the speciality of the elder brother, then bridge-building was becoming the speciality of the younger brother. Tighnabruaich's river-frontage overlooked the railway that brought H.C. Stanley to the area, and the Albert Bridge that did so much to assist the development of the district. However, within three years of his taking up residence in the area, that bridge was washed away, in the 1893 Brisbane Floods. It must have given Henry Stanley enormous personal satisfaction to design the replacement bridge and, having done so, to be able to inspect his own bridge each day from his own home, itself a Stanley construction. In 1901, Stanley moved away, with his family, to the district of Hamilton. =The grand residence= Tighnabruaich, 1991 Francis Stanley's design for Tighnabruaich was a decorative, two-storeyed timber residence with a single-storeyed timber wing and basement. The roof built with a number of steeply pitched gables and dormer windows, a feature popular in other domestic-scaled Gothic revival buildings, and was clad originally with timber shingles. It is thought that the house was erected around 1889, since Henry Stanley is first recorded as being a resident of Indooroopilly in the postal directories of 1890. The estate was conceived as having the villa set in a park landscape and so, about the time that Tighnabruaich was being built, the rest of the property was cleared of vegetation, with the exception of a few specimen Eucalypt trees. These were later augmented with some Ficus specimens. A typical late 19th century garden was established in the immediate vicinity of the house and the park design was completed with the planting of an avenue of trees along a circular carriageway that connected the property to Musgrave Road, the later Clarence Road. In 1891, Henry Stanley entered into a curious financial arrangement with New South Wales grazier Solomon Wiseman, who held title to Tighnabruaich from June that year and who took out a substantial mortgage on the property from the Queensland Investment and Land Mortgage Company. The memorandum of transfer associated with this transaction also records that Stanley had purchased the land from Stamm for ¬£3,100. Wiseman later subdivided the property and four subdivisions fronting Clarence Road were sold around 1900. A Lambert Road subdivision was sold around 1904. Following Wiseman's death in late 1901 the property became the responsibility of trustees. At this time, with the owners of the house, the Stanleys, having left and with Wiseman, the landowner, having died, Tighnabruaich was used briefly as a boarding house for the Bowen House boys' school, located in Ann Street. =The Hemming family= On 6 February 1904, the house was sold to Herbert Brealey Hemming, for the sum of ¬£2200. It was sold with 8 acres, 1 rood and 7.2 perches of land: the total of subdivisions 1-2 and 8-14. Hemming was a leading solicitor in the State of Queensland, an eponymous partner in the distinguished Brisbane legal-practice of Wilson, Newman Wilson and Hemming. He lived at Tighnabruaich, with his family, until around 1915 or 1916. During this period, tennis parties were regular feature of life at Tighnabruaich. At this time there was also a move to put the large grounds were put to some commercial use. Dairy cattle were grazed on part of the land and part of the basement of the house was given over to a milking-parlour and dairy. However, as the family grew up, even the house exceeded requirements and they moved out of the main house, to Witton House, newly located on the estate. From around 1915 or 1916, the main house was leased to Mrs Emma McGill, who operated it as a boarding house for a decade, until the mid-1920s. The house then appears to have remained vacant for nearly two decades, from that period onwards until the military requisitioned it for use during the Second World War. There is a suggestion that Tighnabruaich served as a private hospital in the late 1930s, under a Dr. Underwood, but details of this period are sketchy. An article written for The Queenslander in 1932 described various elements of the grounds of Tighnabruaich, including: some \\"fine old gum trees\\" in the cow paddock adjacent to the railway line; entrance gates to Clarence Street giving access to a drive lined by Camphor Laurels; a tennis court to the south east of the drive; hedging, steps to the lower grounds, accessed through a creeper-clad archway; and some \\"fine Jacarandas and other flowering trees\\". =Witton House= Witton House, in the grounds of Tighnabruaich, circa 1932 Mr. Hemming's impressive property portfolio included another house, Witton Manor, which was also located in Indooroopilly, though further upstream. The grounds of Witton Manor became, for many years, the junior school of St Joseph's College but are now the site of Ambrose Treacy College. Between 1916 and 1919, Witton Manor was moved ‚Äì the detail of the not-inconsiderable enterprise is sadly missing ‚Äì from its original site and onto the extensive grounds of Tighnabruaich. It was positioned in the south west corner of the park, facing the river, and was renamed Witton House. Hemming himself then resided at Witton House from at least 1919 until around 1938. Witton House was eventually demolished in 1967. Following Hemming's death on 8 March 1942, the Tighnabruaich properties were administered by Queensland Trustees Limited on behalf of the Hemming estate. =The Second World War= From about October 1942, the property was requisitioned for use by the military. Tighnabruaich became the main base of a joint United States-Australian intelligence unit: the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section (ATIS), associated with the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre. These units directed the handling of captured Japanese prisoners and documents. During the war many huts and tents were assembled on the grounds for use by American soldiers; brick cell blocks were constructed in the center of the property, north west of the main house, to accommodate Japanese prisoners of war being held for interrogation; two interrogation rooms were erected to the immediate east of the main house; an Orderly's Office was established on the north west side of the main driveway off Clarence Road; a translation room was erected on the tennis court; Witton House functioned as the Sergeants' Mess; and Tighnabruaich was partitioned for office accommodation. The roof of the eastern verandah of Tighnabruaich was removed during this period. ATIS vacated Tighnabruaich about July 1945. =Postwar transition= Toward the end of the war, the Australian Army decided to hold on to Tighnabruaich: the property was transferred to the Commonwealth of Australia on 13 June 1945. From mid-1945 until July 1946 it functioned as an Australian Women's Army Service barracks. During this period, the main house was used as an officers' mess and Witton House accommodated the non-commissioned officers. The Other Ranks occupied the huts and tents in the grounds. From 1946 to 1949, the property was used solely for administrative buildings. In 1949, the main house was converted into two flats to accommodate senior Army officers. At this time, the original eastern verandah was removed to allow for the installation of a staircase to the upstairs flat. By July 1951 the translators' room had been removed from the tennis court and in 1955 a small timber tennis shed or storeroom was erected adjacent to the court. From 1951, the estate was divided into separate elements: the main house, and other establishments set up in the grounds. The main house was restored to single occupancy, as a general's residence. Within the grounds stood two separate barracks: Witton Barracks and Indooroopilly Barracks. =Commander's residence= From January 1951 until mid-1998 Tighnabruaich, the main house of the old estate, served as the home of the General of Command, Northern Command, Australian Army, and later: Commander, 1st Division. After 1957, major works were carried out on Tighnabruaich, to restore it to being a prestige residence: suitable as a family home for the general and his dependents, but suitable also for the entertaining of guests, as required of senior army officers. From this period, many of the alterations made between 1942 and the 1950s were replaced with original or reconstructed fabric. A carport was added to the house in 1958 and in 1962 a lavatory was installed on the ground floor, under the main staircase. The outside staircase to the former upstairs flat was removed in 1966 and the eastern verandah was reconstructed. Between January 1951 and March 1998, some 20 generals took up residence in Tighnabruaich, together with their families. During this period a tradition was established, whereby each family planted a tree on the property. =Private house= In 1998, the site was formally subdivided by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth retained the grounds of the property, but Tighnabruaich house, on a reduced 1.19 hectare plot, was sold freehold to private owners. The grounds associated with Tighnabruaich house retain the river frontage, the early circular carriageway and the mature trees lining this drive, plus the tennis court and the trees planted by the generals resident since 1951. Any military evidence of the Army's presence on this site has since been removed. Tighnabruaich is currently occupied as a private home.  Description  The house of Tighnabruaich occupies a block of 1.19 hectares in central Indooroopilly. The property has frontages to the Brisbane River and to Clarence Road and access to the house is via a circular driveway leading from Clarence Road. The house is a timber-framed building set on brick piers. It is positioned overlooking the river to the south. The house is asymmetric in both plan and elevation. The main part of the residence is two-storeyed, with a single-storey, 'L'-shaped wing on the western side. The fall of the land towards the river provides space for a brick basement under the single- storeyed section. The whole has a corrugated iron clad roof comprising a series of gables and dormer windows. Single-storey verandahs are found on the northern and southern elevations of the building and along the entire length of the eastern elevation. The principal point of entry to the building is in the north elevation, where an elaborate covered porch provides shelter for the main entrance. This consists of a six-panelled cedar door with semi-circular fanlight and sidelights. Generally the interior of the house has plaster ceilings, timber boarded floors and very fine stained-cedar joinery. The stud walls are clad with chamferboard externally and lath and plaster internally. Most doorways have operable fanlights above. The ground floor contains a number of large public rooms with bay windows and French doors, arranged around a central stair hall. An entrance vestibule with a tessellated tiled floor leads to the stair hall through an arched opening filled with a carved timber screen. Plaster archways provide access to the major rooms on the ground floor and these rooms have plaster ceiling roses and deep plaster cornices. The central stairway is an open well with a half-turn timber flight with landings and has very fine cedar joinery including turned balusters, prominent newel posts and spandrel panelling. The upper floor of Tighnabruaich has a number of smaller rooms, again opening off the central stair hall and off halls radiating from this. Some of the upper floor rooms have partially raked ceilings of plasterboard, following the line of the roof trusses. The grounds include large areas of lawn to the north of the house, the early carriageway lined with mature trees and a tennis court to the east of the drive. At the southern end of the site the ground slopes steeply to the river, the bank being heavily vegetated.  Heritage listing  Tighnabruaich was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005 having satisfied the following criteria: The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history Tighnabruaich is a large, two-storeyed timber residence constructed around 1889 for Henry Stanley, Chief Engineer for Railways in Queensland, to a design by his brother, the former Colonial Architect Francis Stanley. The place is important in demonstrating the pattern of growth of Brisbane, specifically at Indooroopilly, where middle-class suburban residential development was attracted to the district after the opening of the Indooroopilly Railway Station, in 1875. As one of a group of substantial, late 1880s residences constructed in Brisbane, Tighnabruaich also contributes to our understanding of the nature of the Queensland economic \\"boom\\" of this period. The property is also significant for its military associations, initially with the work of a Section of the Allied Intelligence Bureau during World War II and then, during the second half of the 20th century, as the showcase residence of the officers commanding the Australian Army in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places The house in its garden setting remains comparatively intact and a good example of a well- designed 19th century middle-class villa. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its class, including planning, use of materials, decorative detailing, riverside location and the retention and layout of the grounds, including the early carriageway, tennis court and plantings. The building is a fine example of the mature domestic work of F.D.G. Stanley and contributes to the body of knowledge about the work of this prolific and influential Queensland architect.

It was designed by John Hall and built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The site was part of a parcel of land purchased by Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior in 1859. In 1876, his friend Graham Lloyd Hart, a city lawyer, purchased a subdivided portion of and in the following year built Greylands. It is likely that Brisbane architect John Hall designed the house. The family resided at Greylands until Hart's death in 1897 except for a period in the 1880s when they lived on Wickham Terrace. While it is unclear who owned the property next, it is likely that Queensland National Bank, which had been mortgagee for the Harts, took over the property. John Piper McKenzie, manager of the Bank's Brisbane Office lived there from 1900-1908. The next tenant was David Lahey, timber merchant, who leased the house from 1910-1912. His daughter Vida Lahey painted the Monday Morning laundry scene at Greylands which hangs in the Queensland Art Gallery. The residence was bought by Bank employee Alfred Dennis in 1912 and the estate was gradually subdivided. Dennis is credited with demolishing the old wooden wings and stables at the back, with building a new extension of five rooms and providing the tennis court. On his death in 1944 the property was sold to Norman Pixley and ultimately to the Power family in 1984, who refurbished the property.  Description  Greylands, circa 1932 The original portion of Greylands is a brick building, single-storeyed at the front and double at the rear. The plan is symmetrical about a wide hallway which features a central screen with double doors. Two rooms on the right are divided by a set of folding doors. On the other side of the hallway are two bedrooms. Joinery throughout is of cedar, and all fireplaces retain their mantelpieces of marble, grates and hearths. Floors in each room are edged in cedar. Original lath and plaster ceilings have been replaced, though plaster cornices remain in all rooms. In the sub-floor at the rear are five small rooms which were used as servants' quarters and a laundry. Externally the house features a fretwork pediment over the front steps. Wide verandahs with cast-iron balustrading extend across the front and along two sides. The verandah roof is supported by paired verandah posts on brick piers, and separated from the main hipped roof of corrugated iron by a cornice with paired console brackets.  Heritage listing  Greylands was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. One of the earliest villa residences in the Indooroopilly area, and a dignified example of 1870s design, the house and its setting provide a glimpse into the way of life of Brisbane's professional and business families. In addition to its elegant exterior form, the house displays craftsmanship and detailing of a high standard including its cedar joinery and other interior decoration. Its appeal is enhanced by the retention of almost 5000 square metres of landscaped grounds which are free from urban intrusion. Greylands was the home of Graham Lloyd Hart, founder of law firm Flower & Hart which has been prominent in Brisbane legal circles since the 1870s.

Habit First described by the botanist William Botting Hemsley in 1894, this species grows to about 10 metres in height with a trunk of some 30 cm in diameter covered in thick, greyish-brown bark, becoming almost black with age, and cracking in a rectangular pattern. Its unusual spiny fruits and palmately compound leaves make this an easily identifiable tree. It was illustrated by Cythna Letty in Flowering Plants of South Africa, vol. 32, plate no. 1279. Fruit Five carpels are joined, forming the spokes of a wheel some 30 cm in diameter. They are woody and densely studded with hard, blunt spines, dehiscing on one side to reveal large (25 mm long), black seeds, which are rich in oil and, after roasting, are a valuable food source. Stinging hairs, common in the Malvaceae, coat the interior of the carpels and these may irritate skin and eyes. The carpels have a superficial resemblance to the Northern Hemisphere Chestnut.

It was filmed on the island of Ischia. The film premiered at the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival and showed at the Locarno Film Festival. It released to Ultra VOD on August 13, 2012 and to theatres on September 13, 2013. Plot Jane (Kate Bosworth) and her husband, Leonard (Iddo Goldberg), travel to Naples, where Leonard has been hired to teach and perform with his instrument of choice, the viola. Jane and Leonard have a strained marriage, with Leonard, in Jane's belief, not being a supportive or caring husband. Jane is writing a sort of memoir about her grandmother's experiences in the world wars while her husband is at work. Jane visits the island of Ischia to avoid the isolation she faces alone in the couple's hotel room. While out on a walk, she meets the young and outgoing nineteen-year-old Caleb, with whom she strikes up an acquaintance. The two spend the afternoon together and share a dinner later that night. Caleb and Jane run away from the restaurant without paying making Jane feel alive, before Caleb confessing to her that he paid the bill when he went to the bathroom. Caleb asks for Jane's phone number but she refuses and catches a ferry back to her hotel room. The following day Jane and Leonard share a lunch in which further strain is shown, with Leonard not understanding why Jane has such a fascination with and envy of the life of a 'young, care-free' teenager. As she is saying this, Caleb suddenly arrives at the restaurant and sits with the couple at Jane's invitation. Leonard shows signs of suspicion of the two and promptly asks for the check. The three walk towards Leonard's work and Caleb leaves them but not before writing his address on Jane's hand despite Leonard pointing out that he has a piece of paper. Jane and Leonard say goodbye to each other and Jane walks away and runs into Caleb again. Jane asks Caleb if he is following her to which he asks whether that would be weird. The two walk together and Caleb confesses to Jane that he couldn't sleep after meeting her and actually planned to bump into her so he could see her again. The two share a passionate kiss. However Jane soon pulls away and questions Caleb's motives before leaving and telling him not to follow her. Jane goes home to have a shower but writes down Caleb's address in her notebook so she doesn't lose it when it washes off. Jane tries to reignite the spark in her marriage and tries to initiate intimacy between the two but Leonard rebuffs her, instead concentrating on his work. Once again, Jane begins to see the cracks in her marriage and soon follows the address in her book to find Caleb. The two share a day of walking, dancing and swimming around the island before the two have sex in his home. Jane goes back to her hotel room and husband the following morning where he scolds her for allowing him to worry about her, especially when she claims she was just walking all night. Jane tells Leonard that they need to talk but he insists that he needs to go to work. That night, when Leonard arrives home they fight and Jane confesses her affair to him. Leonard is angry at first, throwing a glass at the wall, but soon asks Jane to do what she needs to do. He also asks her to meet him at the train station at four the following day so that can depart the country together and re-patch their marriage, no guilt and no questions asked. Jane spends the next morning with Caleb but decides to leave him and reject his offer to travel with him. Jane appears at the train station where Leonard is waiting. Leonard smiles but also points out that she is on the wrong side of the tracks and needs to cross over so they can leave together. Jane smiles back with a hint of sadness and a train comes and blocks Leonard's view of Jane. When the train departs, Jane is gone also, implying she got on the train and left both Caleb and Leonard, leaving the latter alone in the train station. Production Coiro chose to shoot on the island of Ischia because one of her producers had a home there where they could film parts of the movie. While writing the script she used Google Earth to find interesting locations and one on Ischia she and the crew would arrive and illegally film in those locations without asking for permission. The film was shot in colour but director Coiro and her cinematographer ultimately wanted it to be shown in black and white. The film had a successful festival run in black and white but Coiro ultimately decided to release the movie in colour so as not to limit her potential audience.

UCITS funds out of Luxembourg and Ireland faced additional legal questions around the concept of beneficial ownership of A-shares purchased through the link. Eventually, an enhanced SPSA model provided by Hong Kong custodians alleviated much of the concerns, gradually removing barriers for such funds to receive approval to invest via the stock connect link.

It was designed by John Hingeston Buckeridge and built from 1889 to by P Christensen. It is also known as Indooroopilly Church of England Sunday School and the temporary St Andrews Church. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 July 1993.  History  Interior of St Andrews Anglican Church at Indooroopilly, 1939 St Andrew's church hall was built in 1889 on half an acre of land, as the Indooroopilly Church of England Sunday School. Indooroopilly was originally included in the Parish of Toowong when it was formed in 1870. With the advent of the Main Line railway passing through Indooroopilly during the 1870s, an increasing number of people settled in Indooroopilly. Regular Church of England services were not held in the district until the 1880s. In 1888 the first meeting of those interested in the erection of an Anglican church in Indooroopilly was held and a committee formed to pursue this intention. The Parish of Indooroopilly separated from the Parish of Toowong in 1890. Diocesan Architect, John Hingeston Buckeridge, was instructed to prepare a plan for a brick church to accommodate 500 people, and to give an estimate for a portion to seat 250 people. Buckeridge's plan was considered too large, and possibly too expensive, for the district, and he was asked to prepare another plan for a church to seat 250 people. The construction of the brick church was deferred, and it was decided that a Sunday School hall would be erected on the land, at a cost not to exceed ¬£300. The Sunday school hall would be temporarily used as a church, then as a Sunday school when the permanent brick structure was erected. The building was built by P Christensen, and cost ¬£320. It was one of approximately ninety Anglican buildings erected during the episcopate of Bishop Webber, from 1885 to 1903. Webber had an understanding of ecclesiastical design and architecture generally and was responsible for bringing Buckeridge to Brisbane from London, as diocesan architect. Buckeridge was responsible for the design of over twenty timber churches in the Diocese of Brisbane. The land for the church was donated by Graham Lloyd Hart (1839-1897), a prominent Brisbane solicitor and active member of the Church of England. It would appear that Hart's offer of the land was conditional upon a brick church being ultimately erected on the land. A number of memorials to former parishioners were added to the timber building which mainly included furnishings and ceremonial items. A set of three stained glass windows to the memory of Hart who died in 1897, were incorporated in the building in 1900. A new chancel was added in 1902. The sanctuary was built by JL Pratt with the design assistance of WH Mobsby of the Parochial Council. A choir vestry was added to the sanctuary , designed by SC Rookwood. In 1963 the timber building was moved about to the north-west and re-oriented 90¬∞, prior to the construction of the new brick church. Internal alterations were undertaken , to convert the timber building into the parish hall. These included the removal of decorative elements particularly around the sanctuary and altar. The stained glass windows and other memorials were removed, and the majority placed in the brick church in 1965. A timber toilet block has been constructed immediately adjacent to the entry porch of the hall. A new rectory was built at the rear of the hall in 1985.  Description  Entrance, 2014 St Andrews Hall is a single-storeyed Gothic influenced timber hall sited to the rear of a battle axe block, diagonally opposite the present St Andrews Church (1965). The hall has a steeply pitched corrugated iron roof, and exposed stud framing and cross-bracing over chamferboards. The southern end of the hall has a small decorative entrance portico with a pitched roof, while the extensions to the north (sanctuary and choir vestry ) have a lower roofline and project out to the east and the west. These extensions match the rest of the building in external detail. Internal alterations () have included the removal of decorative detailing associated with the sacristy, sanctuary and vestry for refurbishment as a kitchen, servery and store area. The chancel arch appears to have been cut out and sheeted over. The floor has been lowered to the level of the former nave, stained glass windows replaced with louvred windows, and a timber ramp adjoining the entrance portico has been installed. External views of the building are partially obscured by a toilet block abutting the church to the south and a new brick rectory at right angles to the church to the north. The hall is lit with tall rectangular windows which retain their stained glass toplights. Both the doors and windows have pointed arch timber- framed heads inside rectangular frames. The building is protected from water penetration by substantial roof overhangs with shaped eaves brackets, and broad timber weathercapping sloped at 45 degrees over a deep fascia around the base. The corners are protected and articulated with quarter-rounds between studs at right angles, and the gable ends are weatherboarded, the northern end having a leaf-shaped vent. The northern elevation bears the most noticeable marks of change, with the surrounds of now removed stained glass windows, a boarded-in pointed arch window frame, and a now disused door. The entrance portico is finely detailed with carved round columns, a barge-board with a cinq-foil motif, and an exposed roof structure over a timber boarded ceiling. Internally, the church retains its timber boarded floor and ceiling. The ceiling is raked, flattening out halfway, and has round carved timber ventilation panels. The scissor tie-rods to the roof structure are exposed. The building is an externally intact example of exposed frame construction which has particularly well-considered weatherproofing detailing. It also retains with some fine external decorative elements, in particular the entrance portico, and the window and door framings.

History Founder & the First Manager The school was founded in 1913 by a French Missionary Rev. Fr. Servanton. He served the parish and the school from 1898-1948. When the school was established in 1913, there were only two dedicated masters, Mr. Thambu who was the head master himself and Mr. Thangam who assisted him. The start was made only with a few students and the classes were conducted in the present parish hall which was an old and small library then. The school had no buildings of its own. Rev. Msgr. I. B. Pinto took the initiative and responsibility of putting up a permanent structure, without any financial backing and shouldering all the financial constrains. It was in 1950 that St. Anthony's Primary School had a permanent ground floor. Rev. Fr. Anthony Sequeira took over and obtained a grant and approval for appointments in the department. During this period the number of staff also grew in size. Miss B. T. Sakku was appointed as Headmistress in 1955, served the school almost 35 years. To meet the increasing demand of the students, she succeeded in getting departmental approval to open classes 6 and 7 in the year 1959 and also additional sections to classes 1 to 7.

() is an epic four-part poem by Nikolai Nekrasov, which he started publishing in January 1869, in Otechestvennye Zapiski. Part four of it, \\"The Feast for All the World\\" (1876-1877), remained unfinished. Synopsis Seven peasants embark upon the eventful journey across the Russian land united by an idea of finding just one happy person. Witnessing nothing but suffering and injustice all around, they are surprised to find that even those supposed to be the masters of the land find life here totally unsatisfactory. History Nekrasov started working upon the poem soon after the Tzarist manifest abolishing serfdom was published in March 1861. The rough version of the Prologue as well as Part 1 have been ready by 1863; the latter's first chapter were published in Otechestvennye Zapiskis January 1869 issue. The whole of the Part 1 appeared in the 1873 (5th) edition of the Works by N.Nekrasov. Chapter 2, \\"The Last One\\" (–ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥—ã—à, Posledysh) was written in the late 1872 and appeared in print in the OZ February 1873 issue. Part 3, \\"The Peasant Woman\\" (–ö—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—å—è–Ω–∫–∞, Krestyanka), was published in OZ No.1, 1874. In all the posthumous editions \\"Krestyanka\\" featured as part 2 and \\"Posledysh\\" followed it. In 1876-1877 Nekrasov was working hectically upon Part 4, \\"The Feast for All the World\\" (–ü–∏—Ä –Ω–∞ –≤–µ—Å—å –º–∏—Ä), but death from cancer on 28 December 1877 (old style) prevented him from finishing it. =Problems with censorship= All four parts of the poem had their problems with censorship. Part 4, which was supposed to appear in Otechestvennye Zapiskys November 1876 issue, was banned altogether. A.Petrov, the head of the Saint Petersburg censorship committee informed the magazine that it will be closed immediately should it proceed with the proposed publication. For the now terminally ill author this proved to be a heavy blow. According to sister Anna Alekseyevna Nekrasova, on November 19 the poet \\"sent for censor Petrov and for two hours was trying to put it to him that there was nothing reprehensible in the Part 4. He even suggested certain lines in the earlier parts of the poem might have deserved the ban better... Petrov puffed, swiping sweat from his face, occasionally moaning: 'Please calm down, Nikolai Alekseyevich... Once you get better, you'll correct some things and it will pass through...'\\"Literary Hetritage (–õ–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–æ–µ –Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ). Vols. 49/50. Moscow, 1946, pp 174-175 In the last desperate attempt to appease the censors, Nekrasov removed several fragments (including three songs) from Part 4 and added two lines glorifying Tsar Alexander II (Glory to the one / Who's given freedom to the people, - Slavsya, narodu / davshy svobodu). Encouraged by Dostoyevsky who (mistakenly) informed him that Professor N.N.Grigoryev, the chief of the governmental Press and Publishing department, expressed his willingness to lift the ban from the publication of the poem's final part, Nekrasov asked the latter for help in a personal letter: \\"I made some concessions according to the censor [Lebedev]'s demands and removed Soldier's Song along with two more songs, but to throw away Yakov's Story, - and he considers this necessary so as to avoid the arrest of both the book and the journal, - is something I cannot do, for that would render the whole thing meaningless. The ugliness of serfdom at its most extreme is shown here so as to highlight the great moral value of its abolition. How can one maul the poem on the grounds that it features gloomy songs and scenes from the times of serfdom? There is hope in it too. The final verdict depends of your Excellency. As for me, now I regret I had to cut those fragments, I did that against my own convictions.\\" Apparently, Grigoryev was not impressed by Nekrasov's argument, for the final part of the poem remained banned. In January 1881, three years after Nekrasov's death, as the political tension subsided, Saltykov-Shchedrin again presented the final chapter for the censor's consideration. N.S. Abaza, who succeeded Grigoryev as the Press and Publishing department's chief, found nothing wrong with it and the same censor Lebedev signed the permission. In the February 1881 issue of Otechestvennye Zapiski, \\"The Feast For All the World\\" was published for the first time, albeit with all the cuts that Nekrasov had made himself. Having noticed in the proofs the verse glorifying the Tsar, Anna Nekrasova reminded Saltykov that it had been written under pressure and asked for it to be removed. Saltykov answered it was too late to change, besides, it was this version that had been approved by Abaza.N.Shchedrin (M.E.Saltykov). The Works of... Vol. XIX. A letter to N.K.Mikhaylovsky. 1939, Pp 190-191 For some reason Anna Nekrasova decided against removing the offending fragments from the text when she herself was supervising it for the 1881 edition of The Works of N.A.Nekrasov. This was done decades later, starting with the 1927 Soviet edition of it. Elements of folkore One the distinguishing features of the poem is its closeness to Russian poetic folklore. Working upon it, Nekrasov used numerous academic sources and ethnographical collections. He contributed to it some of his own findings too. According to Gleb Uspensky, Nekrasov for twenty years was \\"word by word\\" gathering bits and pieces he later used in the poem.Ptchela, 1878, No 2. \\"Nekrasov worked with the Russian folklore Nekrasov not as a copyist but as a real artist... He managed to work the rich and complex multitude of the Russian proverbs and sayings into the vast tapestry guided by ideological lines with great taste,\\" argued Korney Chukovsky. Chukovsky, K.I. Nekrasov the Master. Ed. IV. Moscow, 1962. Pp 424 - 670 In each of the poem's four parts elements of Russian folklore were used differently. \\"The Last One\\" (Posledysh), a family drama in the form of a poetic novelette, is devoid of it altogether. \\"The Feast For All the World\\" features song-like fragments only occasionally. On the whole its written in a middle class intelligentsia manner, some of its songs (\\"In the moment of gloom, Oh Motherland...\\") sounding like no songs at all. On the other hand, \\"The Peasant Woman\\" (Krestyanka) is built upon the huge bulk of a folklore material. Some of the folk songs have undergone artistic treatment, others (\\"You tell me, why...\\", \\"My hated husband rises...\\") are used here in their authentic forms, documenting Russian peasants's ways of life. \\"Krestyanka\\"'s Chapter 1 features some wedding zaplachki (\\"mourning-rants\\") and pritchety (lamentations) collected by Pavel Rybnikov in the Olonets region. Several songs here are taken from the \\"Songs Collected by P.N.Rybnikov, Vol. I-IV, 1861-1867\\". Chapter 2 of \\"Krestyanka\\" (The Songs) is based upon the books of collected folklore by Vladimir Dal (\\"The Proverbs of the Russian People, 1862\\"), Rybnikov, Pavel Sheyn (\\"Russian Folk Songs\\", 1870), Viktor Varentsov (\\"The Collection of Songs from the Samara Region\\", 1862) and several others. In 1872 folklorist Elpidifor Barsov released his acclaimed \\"Northern Krai Lamentations\\", reviewed in Otechestvennye Zapiski by Nikolai Mikhaylovsky. Several of the verses from it (tellingly, all quoted by the reviewer) were used by Nekrasov in Chapter IV of the Part 3. All belonged to Irina Fedosova, the famous Olonets voplenitsa (lament-cryer). In the tale of Matryona Korchagina, one of this chapter's character, Nekrasov used details of Fedosova's autobiography, related by Barsov in his 1972 book. Legacy Nekrasov's magnum opus is regarded as a groundbreaking work, a \\"great poem, featuring the whole of the Russian people as its main hero,\\" according to Korney Chukovsky. \\"With its extraordinary verbal expressiveness, energy and many discoveries, this is one of the most original Russian poems of the 19th century,\\" wrote literary historian D.S.Mirsky.Chukovsky, K.I..

The Initiative addresses the mitigation of and preparedness for risks related to CBRN material and agents. The origin of these risks can be criminal (proliferation, theft, sabotage and illicit trafficking), accidental (industrial catastrophes, in particular chemical or nuclear, waste treatment and transport) or natural (mainly pandemics but also be the consequence of natural hazards on CBRN material and facilities). The CBRN CoE Initiative seeks to boost cooperation at national, regional and international levels, and to develop a common and coherent CBRN risk mitigation policy at national and regional level. Risk mitigation comprises prevention, preparedness and post-crisis management. Objectives Lack of coordination and preparedness related to CBRN risks at national level and fragmentation of responsibilities within a region can have dramatic consequences. This is why the European Union is setting up a framework for cooperation and coordination amongst all levels of government and international partners. This Initiative is mirroring the EU CBRN Action Plan implemented inside the EU. The main objective of the EU CBRN CoE Initiative is to facilitate regional cooperation in order to enhance CBRN capabilities. Implementers The Initiative is implemented and funded by the European Commission (Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development - EuropeAid (DG DEVCO) in cooperation with the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI). The European External Action Service (EEAS) is also deeply involved in the follow up of the initiative. The Initiative is developed with the technical support of the Joint Research Centre (JRC)) and relevant International/Regional Organisations, the EU Member States and other stakeholders, through coherent and effective cooperation at national, regional and international level. Legal Framework The legal basis for the Initiative is the Instrument for Stability (IfS) (Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2006 establishing an Instrument for Stability, OJ L 327/1 24.11.2006). Funding for the CoE comes from the long term component of the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) that has as one of its aims, amongst many, to mitigate and prepare against risks. The CoE remit, specifically, is to mitigate CBRN risks whether of an intentional, accidental or natural origin. Cooperation with International and Regional Organisations Where appropriate, the CBRN CoE Initiative is working in cooperation with international and regional partners or programmes, such as the IAEA, the OPCW, UNODA, BWC-ISU, the WHO, OIE, FAO, INTERPOL, EUROPOL, the UN SC 1540 Committee, the Arab League, the African Union, ASEAN, ISTC, Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction; each contributing with its own unique support according to its mandate. Regions Growth of the CBRN CoE by year The Centres of Excellence Initiative is present in 60 countries, and is grouped around eight Regional Secretariats: * African Atlantic Fa√ßade (Benin, Cameroon, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Gabon, Liberia, Mauritania, Morocco, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo) * Central Asia (Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan) * Eastern and Central Africa (Burundi, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia) * Gulf Cooperation Council Countries (Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE) * Middle East (Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon) * North Africa and Sahel (Algeria, Burkina Faso, Libya, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Tunisia) * South East Asia (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Muang Lao, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam) * South East and Eastern Europe (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Georgia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia, Ukraine) Projects Once Partner Country needs have been identified, by the implementation of the needs assessment process, regional projects are developed that are carried out to build capacity in the country and complement national measures. There are currently 66 projects underway involving CBRN experts from the Partner Countries together with experts from European Union Member States.

It came out in two volumes in Saint Petersburg in 1845, to be followed by The Petersburg Collection (–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫) and April the First.

The Physiology of Saint Petersburg had considerable success and is regarded in retrospect as a major incentive for the development of realism in the Russian literature.Korney Chukovsky. The Works by N.A.Nekrasov in 8 vol. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura, Moscow. 1967. Vol. IV.Teachers and Precursors. Gogol. IV. 77-141 History In spring 1844 Nikolai Nekrasov tried to publish \\"The Petersburg Corners\\", an excerpt from his autobiographical novel The Life and Adventures of Tikhon Trostnikov, in Literaturnaya Gazeta, but the piece, described by biographer Korney Chukovsky as \\"by far superior to everything he'd written before,\\" was stopped by censors. It was then that the author came up with the idea of compiling an almanac which would unite the authors of the Nikolai Gogol-led \\"natural school\\". He found an enthusiastic supporter in Vissarion Belinsky who at the moment was \\"waging the war for Gogol\\" against the Russian literary retrogrades and instantly recognized in the proposed project a handy vehicle for his agenda. In fact, the style of the introduction written by Belinsky suggested he was a de facto co-editor who took at least some part in compiling the material, Chukovsky argued. Among the works included into the collection were pieces by Dmitry Grigorovich, Ivan Panayev, Vladimir Dal, Evgeny Grebyonka as well as four articles by Vissarion Belinsky (\\"The Introduction\\", \\"The Alexandrinsky Theatre\\", \\"Petersburg and Moscow\\", \\"The Literature of St. Petersburg\\"), but Nekrasov's novelette was its centerpiece. Again, it caused trouble: censor Amply Otchkin found \\"The Petersburg Corners\\" \\"outrageous and indecent,\\" and Nekrasov had to wait almost a year before the offending item was finally censor-approved in February 1845. The publication proved hugely successful. Gogol himself expressed interest, asking his friend Smirnova-Rossette to send a copy to Germany where he was staying at the time. The conservative critics denounced the book unanimously. L. Brandt wrote in Severnaya Ptchela: \\"Nekrasov is just another component of this newest trend, set by Gogol, tending to shy all things sensitive and solemn, preferring instead to reveal scenes that are dirty and dark..., seeing art's goal as the glorification of all things ugly and obscene.\\" Legacy The almanac, aiming to bring the readership as close to the real life in Russia as it was possible (by exposing \\"all the dark corners of our social life, and all the hidden mechanisms of our existence,\\" as Nekrasov put it), became the triumph for the \\"natural school\\". This publication, along with the 1845's Saint Petersburg Collection (the latter featuring among other works, the Poor Folk, Dostoyevsky's debut) are seen as precursors of Nekrasov's Sovremennik.

The local wild fauna are the main themes of the belief system. In the past, the necessity for them to move and to get one's bearing even during the night and at different seasons, by searching the weather's mildness, is probably one of the element which developed their imaginary facing the sky. The key constellations are inspired by occidental ones, but the Mongolian cosmogony associates its own beliefs with them. As Mongolian knowledge transmission is mainly verbal, there are few written sources.  Constellations  Generally, stars represent animals turning around the North Star which is symbolized by the golden stick (Altan Hadaas). Constellations that have different names from Western astrology include Num Sum (The Bow and the Arrow) for the Swan, Doloon Burkhan for the seven stars of the Big Dipper, Gurvan Maral Od (the Three Kings) for Orion's Belt, and Hun Tavan Od (the Five Men) is Cassiopeia.  Planets and stars  Mongolian astrology calculates the positions of each of the planets visible with the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. The names of the celestial and the days they are associated with are: * the Sun: Nar, Sunday * the Moon, Sar, Monday * Mercury: Bud, Wednesday * Venus: Sugar, Friday * the Earth: Delkhii * Mars: Angarag, Tuesday * Jupiter: Barhasbadi, Thursday * Saturn: Sanchir, Saturday * Uranus: Tengeriin-van * Neptune: Dalai-van * Pluto: Dalkhii-van. The particle -van at the end of the name of the final three indicates royal status. Therefore a possible translation of Pluto is \\"the princely ground\\"; Uranus as \\"the princely sky\\", and Neptune as \\"the princely ocean.\\" The names of the celestial bodies come from Sanskrit and are largely used in Mongolian, but in an unofficial way. The star located above Mizar in the Big Bear constellation is prominent in Mongolian astrology. It symbolises the recovery and protection star. According to legend, it was placed there by Tengeriin, the god of heaven, to protect Mizar. In the thirteenth century, to become an archer for Genghis Khan one had to be able to identify these two stars with the naked eye. Mongolian expertise in astrology and astronomy goes back to the fourteenth and fifteenth century astronomer, mathematician and viceroy in Samarkand, Taraghay, known as Ulug Beg, whose empire spread to Central Asia. Turning away from his royal obligations, he examined celestial bodies and astronomical questions. He was the first to precisely measure Saturn's revolution period (Sanchir) with a sextant of 40 meters radius.  Myths and legends  Stars attributions of The Big Dipper in terms of the birth year in the Chinese zodiacal calendar. This illustration is adapted from an illustration of Stellarium software Stellarium. Mongolians are particularly attached to the Great Bear. This constellation is limited for them to the seven Dipper stars making the bear's tail and body, but the legend concerning it is probably the most famous in Mongolia. Once upon a time, there were eight orphan brothers gifted with outstanding capabilities living within a kingdom. The king and the queen lived within it peacefully. One day, a monster came and kidnapped the queen. The king asked the eight brothers to bring her back and said: \\"If one of you succeeds to rescue my beloved, I will give to him a golden arrow\\". The orphans went together to assist their queen. They searched the monster during two days and three nights, when in the middle of the third night, they found and killed the monster. They brought back the queen in the castle. The king did not cut out the arrow in eight parts, he decided to threw it in the sky. The first to catch it could keep it. The younger brother succeeded the test and changed immediately into the North Star (Polar Star). The seven others changed into the seven gods, the seven Gods visiting their younger brother every night. The name Doloon burkhan (the Seven Gods) come from this legend to appoint the Great Bear and the Golden Stick, Altan Hadaas, the Polar Star. One tradition, based on the birth years in the Chinese calendar, concerns the link between Mongolian people and the Great Bear as one star of this constellation is attributed to each of them. Chinese and Mongolian calendars have some similarities (the Mongolian calendar is a lunar calendar). Each year is symbolized by an animal, itself associated to a star of the constellation Great Bear. The first, Dubhe, corresponds to the Rat's year, the second, Merak, corresponds to the Ox and so on until the end of the Great Bear's tail where Alkaid symbolizes the year of the Horse. Then we come back to the first, the Goat year and we repeat the same way until the twelfth and latest year of the Chinese calendar, the one of the Pig. Therefore, the two stars at the end of the tail are assigned one time only. = Sun = At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly dry meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very good archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns without missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself all the fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot (ground-hog) to ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, pulled a first arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth which destroyed the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards the last sun, when a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The bird was hit. The man had not reach his goal, so he left towards exile in a hole, cut his fingers and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved our Sun, otherwise all life would have disappeared from the world's surface. = Eclipses = At that time lived a monster named Raah which frightened the entire world. He devoured all who were in its way. The god Orchiwaani owned a magic spring: whoever drank from it became immortal. One day, Raah stole the spring and drunk. The Moon and the Sun caught the monster in the act and reported to Orchiwaani. Seething with rage to hear about this piece of news he went to fight the monster. He cut its head many times but it grew again immediately because Raah had become immortal. He thought then to cut its tail in order to allow all that it ate to leave again directly. Just as Orchiwaani would seize the monster to finish it off, it escaped and disappeared between the Moon and the Sun. Then Orchiwaani asked the Moon, who recaptured Raah and cut its rump and its tail. In revenge, the monster comes back sometimes to eat the Moon or the Sun which exit immediately, giving rise to moon and solar eclipses. When there is an eclipse, some Mongolians believe it to mean that Raah devours the Moon or the Sun and they make a lot of noise so that the monster liberates the eclipsed star. In the 13th century, Guillaume de Rubruck wrote: \\"Some [Mongolian people] have knowledge in astronomy and predict them [to other Mongolian people] the Lunar and Solar eclipses and, when it is about to produce one, everybody stocks up on food because they do not pass the door of their habitation. And while the eclipse happened, they play the drum and instruments and do big noise and clamors. When the eclipse is finished, they devote themselves to beverage and festivity and do big party.\\" = Other beliefs linked to the sky = According to a Mongolian legend, a woman devoting herself to count one hundred stars in the sky will dream about her future husband. Sometimes, Mongolians honor the Great Bear (Doloon Burkhan) by throwing milk in its direction. Milk, of white color, symbolizes purity in Mongolia. They pray so that something may be fulfilled, but for several persons, not for just one person, because this would bring bad luck. Milk can be replaced by vodka which, even if it is colorless, symbolizes the dark color and the strength for Mongolians. By doing this, it avoids bad luck, quarrels, fear and fends off evil spirits.{{citation needed)) References Category:Cosmogony Category:Mongol mythology ","title":"Mongolian cosmogony"},{"id":"44506798","text":"Women Who Flirt () is a 2014 Chinese-Hong Kong romantic comedy film directed by Pang Ho-cheung and starring Zhou Xun, Huang Xiaoming, Xie Yilin and Sonia Sui.

The \\"dragoon\\" regiments of the line had distinguished themselves in the German Campaign of 1805, and therefore Napoleon decided to reorganize the cavalry of the Guard and create within it a regiment of dragoon guards. This regiment was colloquially known as the Dragons de l'Imp√©ratrice (Empress' Dragoons), in honor of Empress Jos√©phine. Following the Bourbon Restoration, they were renamed Corps royal des Dragons de France (Dragoons of France Royal Corps) but were disbanded shortly afterwards. The Empress' Dragoons were reformed during the Second Empire (1852-1870). Composition The regiment was made up of three squadrons, headed by 60 officers personally selected by Napoleon. The first squadron was to have 296 men, and be made up of \\"v√©lites\\", while the other two were regular squadrons of 476 horsemen. To complete this new unit, each of the 30 dragoon regiments of the line provided 12 men, each with 10 years of service; the brigadier, chasseur, and dragoon line regiments provided the sous-officiers. The unit's numbers rose to 1269 in 1807 with the addition of two new squadrons, and on December 9, 1813, it was attached to the Guard's 3rd regiment of √©claireurs. Campaigns The Empress Dragoons at the battle of Hanau The Dragons de la Garde Imperiale distinguished themselves at the battle of Friedland (1807), and at the battle of Wagram (1809). They suffered heavy losses at the battle of Maloyaroslavets and at the battle of Berezina (1812). They participated in the battles of Leipzig and Hanau (1813) and captured 18 guns at the battle of Saint-Dizier (1814). Their last battle was Marshal Ney's charge at Waterloo (1815). Uniform The dragoons' uniform and weaponry was the same as those of the Guard's horse grenadiers, only in green rather than blue, and (in place of the bonnet √† poil) a copper dragoon helmet with a hanging mane in the Neo-Greek Minerve style, with a red plume. The trumpeters wore a light blue tunic with white lapels and crimson turn backs and collar. The mane on their helmets was white and the plume was light blue. They rode grey horses. They also had a white uniform for parade, consisting of a white coat with light blue lapels and collar lined with gold.

Career  A. Razgon graduated from Lomonosov University in 1948. He was a student and later an associate of N. Rubinstein, a renowned Soviet historian and specialist in the historiography of Russian history. He worked as a Senior scientific officer (1952-1962) and later as the Deputy Director for Science (1962-1972) in the Research Institute for Museum Studies in Moscow. Razgon was the head of the Museum Studies sector at the Museum of Revolution from 1972 to 1974. He headed the Department of cartography of the State Historical Museum, Moscow, from 1974 to 1988. In 1984, he founded the Department of Museum Studies at the All- Union Institute of improvement of professional skills of workers of art and culture, and was the head of the Department until 1989. He was also lecturing on Museology in the Faculty of History at Lomonosov University and in the Department of Museum Studies of the Moscow State Historico-Archival Institute. In the USSR, he was the first academic to attain the rank of Professor in the Department of Museum Studies (1986). Razgon was one of the founders of ICOM‚Äôs International Committee for museology (ICOFOM) and from 1977 to 1983 was ICOFOM‚Äôs Vice President. He participated in the creation of the international Glossary of museum terms Dictionarium museologicum published in 1983 and 1986. Together with museologists from the GDR, Razgon led an international project to write the book ‚ÄúMuseum Studies: Historical museums‚Äù which was published in 1988 and which was, for many years, the main textbook on museology. In the last decades of his life, Razgon put a lot of energy into the development of the theoretical and methodological foundations of the education of professional museologists. The State Historical Museum and other heritage institutions have organized a number of conferences to commemorate his work and ideas for the purpose of the further development of museum theory and practice.  Research interests  Razgon authored over 100 scientific papers on economic history and museology. His research was based on both printed and archival sources as well as on objects from museum collections, and his writings were devoted to the history of historical, archaeological, military and local lore museums and to the protection of monuments of history and culture in the context of the history of society and development of scientific knowledge. Summarizing these observations, his doctoral dissertation \\"Historical museums in Russia in 1861-1917\\" (1973) became an important work in the historiography of Russian museology. He directed the preparation of collective writings on the history of museum work entitled: ‚ÄúEssays on the History of museums in Russia and the USSR‚Äù (1960-1971) and were among those Razgon published about the state of historical museums and monuments from the 18th century to the year 1917. Since the mid1970s, Razgon‚Äôs scientific interests lay mainly in the field of history and the theory of museum work. Razgon considered that museology was showing ‚Äúfeatures of an independent scientific branch‚Äù Razgon A.M. Museological provocations 1979, in Museology ‚Äì Science or just practical museum work? MuWoP 1, 1980, p. 11‚Äì12. that was studying the processes of the preservation of social information, a knowledge of the world and the transfer of knowledge and emotion through museum objects. Razgon was promoting the idea of ‚Äúmuseum sources studies‚Äù, i.e. museum objects analyzed as a source of information. He was also interested in determining the place of museology in relation to other sciences and fields of knowledge and in the improvement of museological terminology. Razgon‚Äôs idea of ‚Äúmuseum sources studies‚Äù as a separate area of knowledge was later developed in the writings of Nina P. Finyagina (1930-2000) and Natalia G. Samarina (1958-2011). From their point of view, the main difference between the ‚Äúmuseum sources studies‚Äù and ‚Äúhistorical source studies‚Äù lay in the emphasis on semantic information that a museum object carries.

In June 1924, Mussolini instructed Cesare Mori to eradicate the Mafia from Sicily and on October 25, 1925, appointed Mori prefect of the Sicilian capital, Palermo. History The 'Iron Prefect' Cesare Mori In 1924, Mussolini initiated a campaign to destroy the Sicilian Mafia, which undermined Fascist control of Sicily. A successful campaign would legitimize his rule and strengthen his leadership.Duggan, Fascism and the Mafia, p. 119 Not only would a campaign against the Mafia be a propaganda opportunity for Mussolini and the National Fascist Party, but it would also allow him to suppress his political opponents in Sicily, since many Sicilian politicians had Mafia links. According to a popular account that arose after the end of World War II, as prime minister of the Kingdom of Italy, Mussolini had visited Sicily in May 1924 and passed through Piana dei Greci, where he was received by the mayor and Mafia boss Francesco Cuccia. At some point Cuccia expressed surprise at Mussolini‚Äôs police escort and is said to have whispered in his ear: \\"You are with me, you are under my protection. What do you need all these cops for?\\" After Mussolini rejected Cuccia's offer of protection, Cuccia, feeling he had been slighted, instructed the townsfolk not to attend Mussolini's speech. Mussolini was outraged.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 152Duggan, The Force of Destiny, p. 451-52 However, according to scholar Christopher Duggan, the reason was more political rather than personal: the Mafia threatened and undermined his power in Sicily, and a successful campaign would strengthen him as the new leader, legitimising and empowering his rule.Duggan, Fascism and the Mafia, p. 119 Mussolini's Minister of the Interior, Luigi Federzoni, recalled Mori to active service and appointed him prefect of Trapani. Mori arrived in Trapani in June 1924 and stayed until October 20, 1925, when Mussolini appointed him prefect of Palermo. Mussolini granted Mori special powers to eradicate the Mafia by any means possible. In a telegram, Mussolini wrote to Mori: > \\"Your Excellency has carte blanche, the authority of the State must > absolutely, I repeat absolutely, be re-established in Sicily. If the laws > still in force hinder you, this will be no problem, as we will draw up new > laws.\\"Petacco, L'uomo della provvidenza, p. 190. Mori formed a small army of policemen, carabinieri and militiamen, which went from town to town, rounding up suspects. To force suspects to surrender, they would take their families hostage, confiscate their property,Lupo, History of the Mafia, p. 175 and publicly slaughter their livestock.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 173 Confessions were sometimes extracted through beatings and torture. Some Mafia members who had been on the losing end of Mafia feuds voluntarily cooperated with prosecutors to secure protection and exact revenge.Lupo, History of the Mafia, p. 182 Charges of Mafia association were typically leveled at poor peasants and gabellotti (tenant farmers), but generally not leveled at wealthy landowners.Lupo, History of the Mafia, p. 179 By 1928, over 11,000 suspects were arrested.Lupo, History of the Mafia, p. 174 Many were tried en masse.Mafia Trial, Time, 24 October 1927Mafia Scotched, Time, 23 January 1928 More than 1,200 were convicted and imprisoned,Selwyn Raab, Five Families, p. ? and many others were internally exiled without trial.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 176 In order to destroy the Mafia, Mori felt it necessary to \\"forge a direct bond between the population and the state, to annul the system of intermediation under which citizens could not approach the authorities except through middlemen..., receiving as a favour that which is due them as their right.\\"The Mafia and Politics , by Judith Chubb, Cornell Studies in International Affairs, Occasional Papers No. 23, 1989 Mori‚Äôs methods were sometimes similar to those of the Mafia: He did not just arrest the bandits, but sought to humiliate them as well. Mori aimed to convince Sicilians that the Fascist government was powerful enough to rival the Mafia and that the Mafia could no longer protect them. Mori's inquiries brought evidence of collusion between the Mafia and influential members of the Italian government and the Fascist Party. His position became more precarious. Some 11,000 arrests were attributed to Mori‚Äôs rule in Palermo,Duggan, Fascism and the Mafia, p. 245 creating massive amounts of paperwork which may have been partially responsible for his dismissal in 1929.Duggan, Fascism and the Mafia, p. 225Newark, Mafia Allies, pp. 45-46 Mori's campaign ended in June 1929 when Mussolini recalled him to Rome. Although Mori did not permanently crush the Mafia, his campaign was successful at suppressing it. The Mafia informant Antonino Calderone reminisced: \\"The music changed. Mafiosi had a hard life. [...] After the war the mafia hardly existed anymore. The Sicilian Families had all been broken up.\\" Sicily's murder rate sharply declined.Lupo, History of the Mafia, p. 186 Landowners were able to raise the legal rents on their lands; sometimes as much as ten-thousandfold. The Fascist Party propaganda machine proudly announced that the Mafia had been defeated.Newark, Mafia Allies, pp. 47-48 Many Mafia members fled to the United States. Among these were Carlo Gambino and Joseph Bonanno, who became powerful Mafia bosses in New York City. In 1943, nearly half a million Allied troops invaded Sicily. Crime soared in the upheaval and chaos. Many inmates escaped from their prisons, banditry returned and the black market thrived. During the first six months of Allied occupation, party politics in Sicily were banned.Dickie.

Career =Journalism= He began work as a journalist in 1973 after graduating cum laude in philosophy from Yale University, joining the Rocky Mountain News in December 1977. He covered police, courts and investigations. In 1983, he began a five-year stint on the investigations unit and city desk of the Denver Post, and then seven years on the investigative unit of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. In 1986, Kilzer and two other Denver Post reporters won for that newspaper a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for a series that debunked the notion that millions of small American children were being kidnapped each year by strangers. He and another Minneapolis Star-Tribune reporter won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting in 1990 for articles exposing how top officials at the Saint Paul Fire Department were profiting from the arson industry. He has also won over a dozen national journalism awards, including the George Polk Award for National Reporting, and the IRE award for investigative journalism. In 1994, Kilzer returned to the Denver Post as investigations editor, followed by five years as investigative reporter where he had begun his career: The Rocky Mountain News. Kilzer covered the insider stock trading by Qwest CEO Joe Nacchio and appeared before his stock fraud indictment and conviction. In 2008, Kilzer accepted the job of editor-in-chief of the JoongAng Daily in Seoul, South Korea. The JoongAng Daily (now known as the Korea JoongAng Daily) is published in partnership with the International New York Times. Kilzer returned to the United States in 2010, taking a job on the investigative unit of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. He retired and moved with his wife, Liz, to Costa Rica where he is pursuing a book writing career. In 2013 he won the William Brewster Styles Award given by the Scripps Howard Foundation for his reporting on international money laundering. Kilzer won the award, together with fellow reporter Andrew Conte and Investigations Editor Jim Wilhelm for work published in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. =Books= Kilzer's 1994 book, Churchill's Deception, sought to prove that Great Britain tricked Germany into attacking the Soviet Union in 1941. It was published by Simon & Schuster. Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"an audacious rereading of the diplomatic history\\" of World War II,\\" in which Kilzer argues \\"that Winston Churchill deliberately nurtured Hitler's illusion that powerful British factions sought an end to the war on terms favorable to Nazi Germany, and thus outwitted Hitler into starting a war against the Soviets that Germany could not win.\\" The book maintains that Rudolf Hess's 1941 flight to Britain was a British intelligence operation, and that the man who died in Spandau Prison in 1987 was not Hess. Kirkus called the book \\"an absorbing and cogently argued original contribution to WW II literature.\\" Booklist said historians would give the book \\"short shrift\\" because it was primarily derived from existing published works, and Library Journal described the Hess theory as \\"generally discredited.\\" His 2000 book Hitler's Traitor: Martin Bormann and the Defeat of the Reich contends that Germany's defeat was largely the result of the Red Orchestra spy ring that had penetrated the German High Command. The book contends that Martin Bormann, a top aide to Adolf Hitler, and Heinrich M√ºller, head of the Gestapo, were both Soviet agents. Publishers Weekly said that Kilzer \\"revisits this arena with an entertaining synthesis of evidence about the activities of these spies, extensive accounts of relevant military history, and informed speculations about causes and effects, motives and behaviors.\\" Kilzer's first book of fiction, co-authored with Mark Boyden, a British business consulting executive, is called \\"Fatal Redemption,\\" published by Enigmas Publishing. \\"Fatal Redemption\\" won several national awards including the IRDA in 2015, the crime fiction award category for the Beverly Hills International Book Awards and the general fiction category of the 2015 Great Northwest Book Festival.

While this is the last look On the corps and the coffin, The soul which they contained, triumphs by trust in God.

We want to promise at the tomb Trust, justice and pious devotion, That the blessed one above, Once our spirit will have risen, Will lead us to the Father. }  Music  The 28-bar-long work in F minor is scored for choir and 3 trombones. The setting of the first two strophes (bars 1 to 8) is identical. It is followed (bars 9 to 16) by the setting of the third strophe, and, after two instrumental bars, ends (bars 19 to 28) with the setting of the last strophe. Although it is a funeral song, it displays little of the mournful character one might expect. The text and the music, with largely diatonic harmony and a predominance of major sonorities, focus instead on confidence about resurrection and salvation. Like the concomitant Libera me, the work contains portents of Bruckner's mature style and has thus a significant place in Bruckner's musical development.K.W.

Work as Raja From 1922‚Äì1950, with Professor Battacharya as administrator, Jhargram developed into a township, and many educational institutions were established. The Kumud Kumari Institution was founded in 1924. In 1925, an annual sports fund was created to encourage athletic activities and to construct a football stadium and the Jhargram Club. Malla Deb established Jhargram Agricultural College, which was later renamed Jhargram Raj College, as well as Vidyasagar Polytechnic for industrial training. He provided funds to set up Sri Ramkrishna Saradapeeth Girls High School and Bharat Sevashram Sangha. In 1931, he commissioned a new palace on 23 acres of land; it is a prominent example of Indo-Saracenic architecture. During World War II, he constructed Dudhkundi Airfield for the United States Air Force and provided the Allied forces with elephants, vehicles, and other help.The Jhargram Palace With the consent of the governor of Bengal, Malla Deb established a hospital for lower-class residents of Jhargram in his late father's name: Chandi Charan Charitable Hospital. Later, similar hospitals were established in every tehsil to serve nearby villages. The raja donated land to the Roman Catholic Church of India and to the Muslim community to build Nurrani Jama Masjid, a mosque, in Jhargram. In 1947, more land was acquired, and the Rani Binode Manjuri Government Girls' School‚Äînow one of the premier schools in Midnapore‚Äîwas built. In Midnapore, he founded the Tuberculosis Chest Clinic and the Homeopathic College, and gave donations for the construction of the Vidyasagar Memorial and the purchase of books for a library. He also bore all of the expenses to build the Midnapore Club and Jhargram Stadium. (It was renamed Aurobinda Stadium after his death.) Between 1928 and 1950, he contributed hundreds of thousands of rupees to welfare causes. In 1947, he gave 10,000 bighas of land to poor farmers, making him the single largest land donor in West Bengal. His beneficiaries ranged from the Kolkata Bangiya Sahitya Parishad to New Delhi Kali Bari. Derecognition In the 1950s, the Constitution of India was amended, the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act was passed, and the estate of Jhargram was merged with West Bengal. In 1971, the government of India abolished all official symbols of princely India, including titles, privileges, and remuneration (privy purses).1\\\\. , \\"Through a constitutional amendment passed in 1971, Indira Gandhi stripped the princes of the titles, privy purses and regal privileges which her father's government had granted.\\" (p 278). 2. Quote: \\"The princes of India ‚Äì their number and variety reflecting to a large extent the chaos that had come to the country with the break up of the Mughal empire ‚Äì had lost real power in the British time. Through generations of idle servitude they had grown to specialize only in style. A bogus, extinguishable glamour: in 1947, with Independence, they had lost their state, and Mrs. Gandhi in 1971 had, without much public outcry, abolished their privy purses and titles.\\" (pp 37‚Äì38). 3. Quote: \\"Although the Indian states were alternately requested or forced into union with either India or Pakistan, the real death of princely India came when the Twenty-sixth Amendment Act (1971) abolished the princes' titles, privileges, and privy purses.\\" (page 78). 4. Quote: \\"The third stage in the political evolution of the princes from rulers to citizens occurred in 1971, when the constitution ceased to recognize them as princes and their privy purses, titles, and special privileges were abolished.\\" (page 84). 5. Quote: \\"Her success at the polls emboldened Mrs. Gandhi to act decisively against the princes. Through 1971, the two sides tried and failed to find a settlement. The princes were willing to forgo their privy purses, but hoped at least to save their titles. But with her overwhelming majority in Parliament, the prime minister had no need to compromise. On 2 December she introduced a bill to amend the constitution and abolish all princely privileges. It was passed in the Lok Sabha by 381 votes to six, and in the Rajya Sabha by 167 votes to seven. In her own speech, the prime minister invited 'the princes to join the elite of the modern age, the elite which earns respect by its talent, energy and contribution to human progress, all of which can only be done when we work together as equals without regarding anybody as of special status.' \\" (page 441). After losing his royal title, Malla Deb served for two terms as a member of the Legislative Council of Bengal. He also served in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament. Personal life In 1930, Malla Deb married Binode Manjari Devi, daughter of the Lal Saheb Girish Chandra Bhanja Deo of Mayurbhanj, a major feudal state in Odisha. They had two children: a son, Yuvraj Birendra Bijoy Malla Deb, born in 1931, and a daughter, Rajkumari Savitri Devi, born in 1943. After his first wife died in 1944, he married Rupa Manjari Devi, with whom he had two daughters: Rajkumari Gayatri Devi and Rajkumari Jayshree Devi.Royal Families of India He was an angler and hunter, for which he won trophies that are still kept in the Jhargram Palace. He went to Odisha for hunting with his friend Zaminder Krishnananda Hota, Zaminder of Dubrajpur He was also a photographer and won international prizes from the United States, Switzerland, Singapore, and the Soviet Union. He had a deep knowledge of Vaishnav Sangeet music and organized regular concerts at the palace. Malla Deb died on 11 November 1976 in Kolkata. Legacy Malla Deb was known for working to rehabilitate Bengali Hindus from East Bengal in Jhargram and Midnapore during the partition of India. After India gained its independence, he owned businesses in Kolkata and large real estate properties in Kolkata, Midnapore, and Digha. His son Yuvraj Birendra Bijoy got involved in politics and was a two-time member of the Legislative Assembly of West Bengal from Jhargram's Vidhan Sabha constituency, representing the Indian National Congress. His son Shivendra Bijoy Malla Deb‚ÄîNarasingha Malla Deb's grandson‚Äîis a social worker and politician associated with the All India Trinamool Congress, and the chairman of Jhargram Municipality.

It was designed by Richard Gailey and built . It is also known as Louis Stamm residence. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 May 1999.  History  This residence on Westminster Road, Indooroopilly, was constructed in about the 1890s as the home of Louis Stamm, a Brisbane-based business man. The building is thought to have been designed by prominent local architect, Richard Gailey. The building was last occupied as a residence in c. 1999. During the 1880s and 1890s Indooroopilly developed as a fashionable suburb with the construction of a number of substantial residences. Louis Stamm, who later built the residence on Westminster Road, purchased a 42-acre block at Indooroopilly on 21 April 1873 only two years before the opening of the Indooroopilly railway station. The coming of the railway provided the major impetus to the development of the suburb. By the late 1880s government and social facilities, including a school, an hotel, shops and a carpenter were established in Indooroopilly. Louis Stamm is variously described in sources as a merchant, newspaper proprietor and brewery owner in Queensland. He is listed in the Queensland Post Office Directories simply as a Justice of the Peace. Stamm subdivided the Indooroopilly property which included land adjacent to the railway station in 1875, the year that train services were established, and land was sold from this original allotment during the next twenty years encouraging further growth of the suburb. Major suburban residences including Ross Roy, Claude William Chambers' own house dating from 1897; Henry Hunter's own house designed by him on Clarence Road in 1888; William Archdall's house on Station Road by Hunter and Corrie of 1891; Warwillah (Glencairn) for FC Bolton designed by Charles McLay in 1892; Riverton for James Cannan and Tighnabruaich for Henry Charles Stanley both designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley in the late 1880s; Newlands for Newman Wilson designed by Alexander Brown Wilson in 1889 and a number of houses designed by Oakden, Addison and Kemp including Warranoke for Gilson Foxton, Robert Rendle's house and George Henry Male Addison's own house, Fernbrook, all dating from the late 1880s-early 1890s. This residence, which Louis Stamm constructed for his own use in the 1890s belongs to the tradition of these other houses. Louis Stamm is thought to have commissioned local architect, Richard Gailey to design the building. Gailey was commissioned for the design of a number of substantial residences in the late nineteenth century, including Moorlands, Glen Olive (his own house) and Verney. A description of early large homes in Indooroopilly appeared in the Brisbane Courier of 15 August 1931 which after listing a number of the houses mentioned above describes the house of Louis Stamm: > \\"...while the home of Mr LJ Keating, on Westminster-road was constructed to > the design of the late Mr Richard Gailey and is considered to be one of the > outstanding examples of residential architecture in Brisbane. It was built > by Mr Keating's grandfather, the late Mr L. Stamm about 35 years ago and > used to be occupied by the late Dr Hawkes, Mr HR Boer (at one time Attorney > General), Mr T Daley, solicitor and other prominent citizens.\\" It seems that Louis Stamm may never have lived in this house, as his residence is listed most often as at 25 Herbert Street, Spring Hill. Stamm was an early Chairman of the Indooroopilly Divisional Board when it separated from Taringa Division and Toowong Division. By 1885 Stamm retained only of his original Indooroopilly allotment and this was mortgaged to Henry Love who subdivided it in the late 1880s. Stamm retained lots 71, 72 and 73 of Portion 46 and this transfer from Love was recorded in 1898. Stamm is thought to have built the house at about this time. The residence appears to have been leased to a number of people during the years from its construction to the 1920s when the Keating family moved there. Stamm died in 1903 and the house and land were passed to his daughter Mary Louisa Keating, who had married Andrew Keating in 1884. Mary Louisa and Andrew had two children, Louis Joseph and Margaret Francis. Louis Keating and his wife, Eileen Matilda, moved into the residence on Westminster Road in 1924. Eileen Matilda died and Louis remarried, Eileen Phillis. Following the death of Louis Keating, Eileen Phillis Keating remained at the residence until early 1999. During the 1920s or 1930s the house seems to have been extensively renovated. Much of the interior fittings and finishing of the present building, particularly on the ground floor, along with some external detailing, appear to date from this period rather than from the late 1900s from which the shell of the house dates. The property was unoccupied after 1999 and was sold by the Public Trustee in 2002 to Amalek Pty Ltd. In 2008 Amalek were served with a maintenance notice to repair doors and windows, clear the drains and fence and mow the yard. As the building had not been well-secured, vandals had broken in resulting in damage and theft, allowing for subsequent rain damage. It was the first application of changes made by the Queensland Government to the Queensland Heritage Act 1992 to allow the government to force owners to maintain their heritage properties or pay a fine up to $75,000.  Description  The Keating Residence, Indooroopilly, is a substantial rendered brick two-storeyed house, prominently sited on a principal thoroughfare from Indooroopilly Railway Station to the Indooroopilly Shopping Centre. The building is apparent from many surrounding streets and is distinguished from other development in the area by its age and unusual architectural treatment. The residence is a two-storeyed building, with unusual external features such as a pyramidal roofed tower on the principal elevation and extending its octagonal plan form down through the corner of the building. The building is essentially rectangular in plan with one of the short faces of the plan from facing Westminster Road being the principal facade of the building. The octagonal tower element projects from the south eastern corner of the plan. The building has a complex roof structure, dominated by the tower element which is higher that the other roof elements. The entire roof and the awnings which line the faces of the building are clad with corrugated iron sheeting. A number of gabled projections extend from the face of the building. The gable ends are treated with diagonally battened panels incorporated into which are fine finials and drop mouldings. Variously sized gabled projections occur on each of the four faces of the building, from various points. This asymmetrical massing contributes to the overall picturesqueness of the structure. Stairs leading to the house, 2014 Access is provided to the building from a two part stair extending from the Westminster Road footpath to the entrance door. The Westminster Road boundary of the property is bordered by a large rendered masonry fence which acts as a retaining wall, braced by a number of piers. The fence is capped with a row of face bricks. Centrally positioned in this fence is a wrought iron gate providing access to a series of concrete stair rendered with a red colouring. These stair reach a concrete landing level with the surrounding landform and from here a second series of concrete steps lead to the front door. This second series are flanked by a short rendered masonry wall with face brick capping. The southern elevation which is the principal facade, has a central entrance bay, with the tower element to the east and a gabled projection to the west. The central entrance, to which access is provided via the already mentioned stairs, is a single timber framed and glazed door with an elliptical fanlight above. The glazing in these features and in most other openings throughout the building is arctic glass. The tower element is lined on both storeys with round arched window openings fitted with casements and a round arched transom above. Below the windows, which are separated by simple moulded pier-like elements is a concrete panel with six rectangular perforations, filled with glass bricks on the inside face. The ground floor of tower windows are shaded by an awning supported on oversized brackets and extending from the front door around to the eastern facade of the building. The gabled projection on the southern face of the building features a ground floor bay window which has a steeply pitched hipped awning supported in similarly oversized brackets. The upper floor of the gabled element features a central three part window opening, again shaded by an awning. The entire building is lined with a series of concrete rendered mouldings, at base level forming a plinth; at the level of the sill of the ground floor windows; at the level of the base of the round arched windows above the ground floor windows; at the line of the first floor; at the line of the sills of the first floor windows and, again, at the top of these windows, below the arched transoms. This banding is variously smooth rendered and moulded. The western, eastern and northern faces of the building, continue the banded mouldings, fenestration patterns and gable detailing. Internally, the two floors of the building are arranged around a central hall which continues northward from the position of the front door to the rear of the building. On the ground floor the front door provide access to a large porch area which incorporates the area of the tower element. The large proportion of window openings in the walls ensure that this porch area and a similar area on the first floor are naturally lit and ventilated. The flooring in the porch is of terrazzo tiles which have been formed into patterns reflecting the unusual planform of the spaces. French doors open onto the porches from internal rooms. A large nineteenth-century doorway opens from the ground floor porch to the hallway of the house. It is thought that this was the original entrance to the building when the porches were only semi-enclosed prior to the renovations of 1920s. This doorway comprises a single timber panelled and moulded door flanked by sidelights and a transom panel above. The sidelights and transom feature leadlight panels. This door leads onto the hall, in the vicinity of the timber dog-leg stair. The stair features turned newel and balusters and is clad with stained timber boarding on the underside. The hall of the ground floor, like most of the rooms on this floor is lined with timber panelling to a height of about . The hall features a number of plaster rendered archways supported on piers. The ceiling of the hall is plastered and without cornices. The first room on the west of the hall from the doorway is a study, which has a large bay window into which is fitted a window seat. The three windows within the bay are fitted with leadlight panels. The walls of the study are lined with timber panelling surmounted by a plate rail supported on timber brackets aligned with the framing of the wall panelling. The ceiling of this room is lined with pressed metal, with a central panel, borders and cornices. Like this room the drawing room on the ground floor is lined with timber panelling with a plate rail and has elaborate pressed metal ceilings. A white marble fireplace and a large three part window opening with leadlight panels are features of this room. The dining room on the ground floor, which is in the north eastern corner of the building, is the only room on the ground floor which survives with a nineteenth century interior. The room has plaster walls, a plaster moulded cornice, a white marble fireplace with cast iron grate and surrounds and a tiled hearth. The rooms on the upper floor have been more recently renovated, with s wall veneer panelling on all walls and plaster walls and ceilings. The windows are framed in original moulded timber framing. The ceiling of the first floor hall has been recently repaired with plasterboard.  Heritage listing  Keating Residence, Indooroopilly was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 May 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The residence at 10-12 Westminster Road was constructed in the late 1890s and demonstrates the development of Indooroopilly at this time when a number of substantial, architect designed residences were built on large allotments. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is an outstanding example of late nineteenth century architecture in its picturesque massing, unusual detailing and garden setting. The interiors of the house are of particular significance, with intact fittings and fixtures dating from the 1920s. In particular the timber wall panelling, pressed metal ceilings, carpeting, fixed furnishing and other fittings on the ground floor of the residence are of particular interest. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The residence has aesthetic and social value as a local landmark. The building is prominently sited on a principal thoroughfare and is distinguished by its unusual architectural treatment and age from the surrounding development.

The campaign, which is led by parents and traces its origins to a thread on the on-line forum Mumsnet, is a spin-off of the Let Toys be Toys campaign, which seeks to get toy manufactures to stop gendering their products. In its founding statement, the campaign said: ‚ÄúChildren are listening, and take seriously the messages they receive from books, from toys, from marketing and the adults around them. Do we really want them to believe that certain things are off-limits for them because of their gender? They‚Äôre not ‚Äògetting it wrong‚Äô if a girl likes robots, or if a boy wants to doodle flowers. [...] It's time that publishers Let Books Be Books and leave children free to choose their interests for themselves‚Äù. Response from authors Prominent authors supporting the Let Books Be Books campaign include former and current children's laureates Anne Fine and Malorie Blackman, the poet laureate Carol-Ann Duffy, and Philip Pullman. Anne Fine told UK newspaper The Guardian: > \\"You'd think this battle would have been won decades ago. But even some > seemingly bright and observant adults are buying into it again [‚Ä¶] There are > girls of all sorts, with all interests, and boys of all sorts with all > interests.

But > no, these idiotic notions are spouted so often they become a self-fulfilling > societal straitjacket from which all our children suffer\\". Also speaking to The Guardian, Pullman, author of the His Dark Materials trilogy, said: > \\"I'm against anything, from age-ranging to pinking and blueing, whose effect > is to shut the door in the face of children who might enjoy coming in. No > publisher should announce on the cover of any book the sort of readers the > book would prefer. Let the readers decide for themselves\\". Response from publishers In the week following the campaign's launch, Parragon Books responded on Twitter, tweeting: \\"Feedback on gender-specific titles is important to us. We have no plans to create new titles referring to boy/girl in the UK\\". In the same week, publisher Usborne announced that a plan to \\"discontinue publication of titles such as these was decided some time ago‚Äù, adding that the company took \\"feedback on gender-specific titles very seriously‚Äù and that it had \\"no plans to produce any titles labelled 'for girls' or 'for boys' in the future\\". On Sunday 16 March, the literary editor of the UK newspaper the Independent on Sunday, Katy Guest, announced: > ‚ÄùGender-specific books demean all our children.

And nor will the children‚Äôs books blog at independent.co.uk‚Äù. However, Michael O'Mara, owner of Buster Books defended his company's gender- specific titles, such as The Beautiful Girls' Colouring Book and The Brilliant Boys' Colouring Book, to The Independent on Sunday in March 2014, saying: > ‚ÄùIt's a fact of life how a very large percentage of people shop when buying > for kids, do it by sex.

In November 2014, Ladybird Books signed up to the Let Books Be Books campaign and announced that it was \\"committed\\" to avoiding gendered titles and would be removing such labelling in reprinted copies. The publisher added: \\"Out of literally hundreds of titles currently in print, we actually only have six titles with this kind of titling\\". Its parent company, Penguin Random House Children's division, will also be following suit.

The Popular Front (PF), despite not having the formal endorsement of either the Labour Party or the Liberal Party, fielded candidates at parliamentary by-elections with success. There was no general election to test the support of the PF, and therefore the opportunity for it to form a government. Origins of the Popular Front The Popular Front was launched in December 1936 by the Liberal Richard Acland, the Communist John Strachey, Labour's economist G. D. H. Cole, and the Conservative Robert Boothby. Acland and Boothby were both serving in the House of Commons at the time.\\"The Liberal Party and the Popular Front\\", in English Historical Review (2006) =Richard Acland= Richard Acland was a new Liberal member of parliament who had gained Barnstaple from the Conservatives at the 1935 election. He quickly became an influential figure on the left of the Liberal Party, advocating closer ties with the Labour Party and electoral co- operation with them at constituency level. He also became an outspoken supporter of a Popular Front, and then one of its founders. =John Strachey= Strachey was elected as a Labour Member of Parliament for Birmingham Aston in 1929, serving until 1931. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Oswald Mosley and resigned from the Parliamentary Labour Party in 1931 to join Mosley's New Party. Following the New Party's drift towards fascism, he resigned to become a supporter of the Communist Party, contesting the Aston constituency as an independent. As the author of The Coming Struggle for Power (1932), and a series of other works, Strachey was one of the most prolific and widely read British Marxist-Leninist theorists of the 1930s. In 1936 with the publisher Victor Gollancz he founded the Left Book Club.Stuart Macintyre, John Strachey, 1901-1931: The development of an English Marxist, MA thesis, Monash University, 1972. =G. D. H. Cole= Cole was an Oxford academic, writer and political theorist who favoured libertarian socialism. He was a notable figure in the Labour Party. In 1936 Cole began calling for a Popular Front movement in Britain, where the Labour Party would ally with other parties against the threat of fascism.Daniel Ritschel, The Politics of Planning: The Debate on Economic Planning in Britain in the 1930s. Oxford University Press, 1997 (pp. 282‚Äì83) =Robert Boothby= Boothby had been the Scottish Unionist Party Member for Aberdeen and Kincardine East since 1924. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill from 1926 to 1929. United Front The PF campaign was preceded by the United Front campaign. The campaign for a United Front, sought to get co- operation between the Labour Party, the Independent Labour Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain. A major part of that unity campaign was to have electoral co-operation against the National Government at a future general election. In 1931 the ILP had disaffiliated from the Labour Party and at the 1935 General Election the ILP and the Labour Party had fielded candidates against each other that had resulted in cases of the National Government candidate winning due to a split left vote. Within the Labour Party, one of the leading figures in support of the United Front was Sir Stafford Cripps. By 1937 the Labour Party showed little indication for resolving this issue and those within it ranks such as Cripps faced expulsion as a result. =Sir Stafford Cripps= He was Labour MP for Bristol East and Solicitor General in the last Labour government of 1931. He had not given up on trying to unite the left and saw that supporting the Popular Front would achieve the same aims. In putting the case for a Popular Front, he argued that the Labour Party acting alone would not be able to defeat the National Government. Party responses to the Popular Front =Communist Party= The Communist Party of Great Britain took its lead from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). The view of the CPSU in the mid-to-late 1930s was that Communist parties across Europe should form Popular fronts to work with all other anti-Fascist parties to oppose Fascism. The CPGB was happy to fall in line with this position. =Independent Labour Party= The ILP, who had chosen not to affiliate with the Labour Party during the 1930s, had been supporters of the United Front with Socialists and Communists. However, they did not support the Popular Front as it was to include the Liberal Party. At the 1937 ILP Conference they voted to oppose a Popular Front but to continue to support a United Front.Manchester Guardian 30 March 1937 At their 1938 Conference, leader James Maxton re-affirmed his party's opposition to the Popular Front. The ILP remained an opponent of any co-operation with capitalist parties, even after war broke out in 1939. When all the political parties agreed to a wartime electoral truce, the ILP refused to agree. =Labour Party= The Labour Party National Executive published a letter on 13 April 1938, opposing the Popular Front. Co-operative Party The Co- operative Party, which was affiliated to the Labour Party, held its 1938 Conference during April. Party Chairman Alfred Barnes personally endorsed the Popular Front and 2 days later, the conference voted in favour of the Popular Front.The Liberal Magazine, 1938 However, when the Co-operative Party met in 1939 for its Conference, this position was narrowly overturned. Labour Party Conference 1939 =Liberal Party= The attitude of the Liberal Party gradually changed during this period. At the 1935 General Election, former party leader David Lloyd George, through his Council of Action had demonstrated a willingness to support both Liberal and Labour candidates. After the 1935 elections Lloyd George and his parliamentary group returned to the mainstream Liberal Party and continued with the Council of Action. The first time the Liberal Party formally considered the Popular Front was at a meeting of their Executive Committee on 20 October 1936. They had received the proposal to support the Popular Front from writer and philosopher Aldous Huxley. Their response was to recommend to the Liberal Party Council that the front not be supported. They stated that the executive did not think that an electoral pact with Labour was possible and arguably desirable. At the meeting of the Party Council on 18 January 1937, this position was agreed. In April 1937 the issue was debated at the Union of University Liberal Societies Conference. Once again the front was rejected.The Liberal Magazine, 1937 Popular Front by-elections At the 1937 Combined English Universities by- election former Liberal MP Thomas Edmund Harvey gained the seat from the Conservatives standing as an Independent Progressive, seeking to rally anti- government supporters on the left. The success of this campaign caused many left leaning academics to consider if candidates standing under a similar platform could be as successful in non-University seats. Throughout the parliament, the National Government would frequently find themselves only opposed by one opposition candidate, either Labour or Liberal. Some of these candidates sought to campaign on the Popular Front platform, with varying degrees of support from other parties. There were few specific cases of an anti-government candidate standing on a Popular Front platform as opposed to a party platform. In such cases these candidates ran as Independent Progressive. =Oxford= The 1938 Oxford by-election was held on 27 October 1938. The Liberal Party had selected Ivor Davies,Liberal History, Spring 2002 a 23-year-old graduate of Edinburgh University, despite the fact that he was the candidate for Central Aberdeenshire at the same time. The Labour Party selected Patrick Gordon Walker, who had contested the seat at the 1935 general election. On 13 September, Davies offered to stand down from the by-election if Labour did the same and backed a Popular Front candidate against the Conservatives.By-Elections in British Politics Eventually, Gordon Walker reluctantly stood down and both parties supported Sandy Lindsay, who was the Master of Balliol, as an Independent Progressive. The Conservatives held the seat with a reduced majority of 3,434 or 12.2%. =Bridgwater= The 1938 Bridgwater by-election was held on 17 November 1938. Vernon Bartlett was a journalist and broadcaster with extensive experience of foreign affairs. He was approached by Richard Acland, Liberal MP for Barnstaple, a seat bordering Bridgwater, about standing as an anti-appeasement candidate in the by- election.Spartacus Educational Bartlett agreed to do so providing he had the support of the Liberal and Labour parties. The Bridgwater Liberal Party unanimously backed Bartlett's candidature.The Times 26 October 1938 Before the by-election vacancy was known, the local Labour Party had already re-adopted Arthur Loveys their previous candidate, to contest a General Election expected to occur in 1939. Loveys withdrew and Labour generally supported Bartlett, although many in the Labour Party were unenthusiastic about co-operation with the Liberals.The Times 9 November 1938 Some Labour voters were reluctant to support Bartlett, believing he was really a Liberal candidate.The Times 17 November 1938 However, he did receive a letter of support from 39 Labour MPs just before polling day. Bartlett won the seat with a majority of 2,332 or 6.3%. He hailed the result as a defeat for Chamberlain, saying that it showed people understood the dangers of the Government's foreign policy.The Times 19 November 1938 =Westminster Abbey= The 1939 Westminster Abbey by-election was held on 17 May 1939. The Labour candidate in 1935, William Kennedy, had been re-selected to contest the next General Election, however, the Labour party decided not to contest the by-election. The Communist party, who had not contested the seat before, chose Dr. Billy Carritt, to stand. In an attempt to revive the Popular Front strategy, Carritt stood as an Independent Progressive. Carritt attracted the highest ever percentage poll of any anti- Conservative candidate in this seat. The performance revived interest nationally in electoral co-operation to defeat National Government candidates at a General Election. Popular Front in the constituencies Despite the defeat of the Popular Fronters at the Labour Conference, co-operation between constituency Labour and Liberal organisation continued to grow through the year. It was widely anticipated that Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain would call a general election in 1939 and all political parties were going through the process of selecting local candidates. =Tiverton= Tiverton had been a Conservative seat since they took it from the Liberals in 1923. No Liberal or Labour candidate had stood since 1929. The Liberals had selected a candidate, A. Turner, back in 1938. There was no Labour candidate in place. The former Liberal MP for Tiverton was the North Cornwall Liberal MP, Sir Francis Acland. He was the father of PF founder, Richard Acland. The Aclands had a strong influence over the Tiverton Liberal Association.Killerton, Camborne and Westminster: the political correspondence of Sir Francis and Lady Acland The Tiverton Liberals were open to the idea of supporting an Independent Progressive, if such a candidate were supported by the local Labour party. It was thought that another Liberal, Michael Pinney, would appeal more to the local Labour Party. By March 1939 Pinney had agreed to stand as a Popular Front candidate and Turner had agreed to withdraw in his favour.Western Morning News 29 March 1939 In April 1939 the local Liberals and the local Labour Party both formally endorsed Pinney.Western Morning News 17 April 1939 In May 1939 the national Labour Party decided to bar the Tiverton division from the party.Western Times 12 May 1939 Aftermath Calls for a Popular Front ceased when Britain declared war on Nazi Germany. However, it was becoming increasingly recognised that during wartime, it was better to have a broad based government that could command all-party support. By May 1940 Winston Churchill had become Prime Minister and had included in his new government other Conservative anti-appeasers and the leaders of the Labour and Liberal parties. The Communist Party's support for co-operation fluctuated depending on the foreign policy of the Soviet Union. John Strachey left the party and re-joined the Labour Party. The ILP was to take a semi-anti-war position. In 1940 Cripps was appointed by Winston Churchill as Ambassador to the Soviet Union. In 1942 Acland broke from the Liberals to found the socialist Common Wealth Party with J. B. Priestley, opposing the war-time electoral truce between the major parties. At the 1945 General election, there were a handful of instances of Labour not running candidates in Con/Lib constituencies, but essentially there was no electoral co-operation between Labour, Liberal and Communist or even in Bridgwater where Labour decided to oppose Vernon Bartlett standing for re-election as a Progressive.

Chu from a screenplay by Ed Solomon and a story by Solomon and Peter Chiarelli. It serves as a sequel to 2013's Now You See Me and the second installment in the Now You See Me series. The film stars an ensemble cast that includes Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Daniel Radcliffe, Lizzy Caplan, Jay Chou, Sanaa Lathan, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman. The plot has the Four Horsemen and their leader Dylan Rhodes recruited by Walter Mabry, a criminal mastermind, to steal a data chip. On July 3, 2013, the film was officially announced to be in development. Filming began in November 2014 and lasted until May 2015. The film was released on June 10, 2016, by Lionsgate. It received mixed reviews from critics but was a box office success, grossing $334 million worldwide. Plot Eighteen years later FBI, the fugitive Four Horsemen ‚Äì J. Daniel Atlas, Merritt McKinney, Jack Wilder, and new member Lula May ‚Äì await orders from the Eye, the secret society of magicians. The Horsemen‚Äôs handler, FBI Special Agent Dylan Rhodes, delivers their instructions: the Horsemen are to expose corrupt tech CEO Owen Case, whose latest cell phone will secretly collect users‚Äô personal data to sell on the black market. In New York City, the Horsemen hijack the phone‚Äôs launch, but are interrupted by a mysterious figure who reveals to the public that Jack faked his death, and that Dylan is working with the Horsemen. Dylan eludes the FBI as the Horsemen escape down a construction chute only to find themselves in Macau. They are captured by Chase, Merritt‚Äôs twin brother, and brought to Walter Mabry, Owen‚Äôs former business partner. Having exposed the Horsemen in New York, Walter reveals how they were lulled unconscious and flown to Macau. He explains that Owen took his company from him, as well as a chip designed by Walter to access any computer system in the world. Despite the protests of the other Horsemen, Daniel agrees to steal the chip for Walter before Owen can sell it. They acquire supplies from a magic store owned by Li and Bu Bu, and arrange to deliver the chip to the Eye, knowing they cannot trust Walter. Posing as potential buyers, they infiltrate the Macau Science Center, using cardistry and sleight of hand to sneak the chip past its supervisor, Allen Scott-Frank. Dylan is contacted by Thaddeus Bradley, the magic debunker he framed for the Horsemen‚Äôs crimes. Thaddeus offers his help in finding the Horsemen, and Dylan extradites him from prison. They go to Macau, and Dylan finds Daniel waiting to give the chip to the Eye. Walter arrives, having manipulated Daniel into believing he was in contact with the Eye, and Dylan fights Walter‚Äôs men as Daniel escapes with the chip. Captured, Dylan discovers Walter is the son of Arthur Tressler, whose fortune Dylan and the Horsemen stole. Walter and Arthur lock Dylan in a safe and drop him underwater, mirroring the death of Dylan‚Äôs father. Arthur pays Thaddeus for bringing him Dylan, and Thaddeus promises to deliver the Horsemen as well. Dylan escapes from the safe and is rescued by the Horsemen. Realizing the chip they have is a fake, they resolve to stop Walter from acquiring the real chip, and are joined by Li and Bu Bu. The Horsemen announce a new performance in London, with an implicit threat to expose Walter, who flies to London with Arthur and Chase in a private jet. On New Year‚Äôs Eve, the Horsemen perform across the city, but they and Dylan are captured by Walter‚Äôs men and brought to the jet. Once in the air, they are forced to hand over the fake chip, which Walter confirms is real. Dylan and the Horsemen are thrown out of the plane, which is revealed to be a set floating on the Thames. They explain how they had misled the three into thinking they had won and reveal Jack had hypnotized Chase into throwing them out of the plane as planned. Walter, Arthur, and Chase‚Äôs misdeeds are broadcast to the crowd and around the world, and they are taken into FBI custody as Dylan and the Horsemen escape before the FBI can apprehend them. They arrive at the Greenwich Observatory, where they meet other members of the Eye, including Li, Bu Bu, and Allen. Their leader is revealed to be Thaddeus, who explains to Dylan that he was actually his father‚Äôs partner in magic and was pretending to be his rival this whole time. He appoints Dylan the new leader, and the Horsemen are shown a secret entrance to see more of the Eye. Cast * Jesse Eisenberg as J. Daniel Atlas.

He was known for his writings on the compagnons, or members of workers' brotherhoods, in which he preached peaceful relations between the brotherhoods, and the intellectual and moral improvement of their members. He became a deputy after the 1848 revolution, and was forced into exile after Napoleon III took power in 1851. His last years were spent in obscurity and poverty. Early years Agricol Perdiguier was born in Mori√®res-l√®s-Avignon, Vaucluse on 3 December 1805, the seventh of nine children. His father was a joiner and his mother a seamstress. The family was relatively well off, since his father also owned fields and vineyards, and put his children to work. During the French Revolution in 1789 his father joined the Avignon volunteers, and reached the rank of captain in the Army of Italy. Agricol grew up speaking the Occitan language of Le Midi, very different from the French of the north. He had a basic schooling for two or three years, and learned to read, write and do arithmetic. He learned French, but did not learn how to pronounce it correctly. After the Bourbon Restoration of 1815 his father went into hiding to escape the Second White Terror and was later arrested. The White Terror was particularly severe in the southeast of France and strongly affected Agricol Perdiguier. He was persecuted for having supported Napoleon during the Hundred Days although only a child of ten at the time. Carpenter Agricol Perdiguier towards the end of his life Perdiguier's father decreed that Agricol would become a carpenter when he was 13 or 14. In 1822 he was sent to work for a year with a friend of his father, a carpenter in Avignon. He then went to work for M. Poussin, another friend of his father. Both of his masters belonged to societies of compagnons, or crafts guilds, and M. Poussin advised Perdiguier to join one. In 1823 he was hired by M. Ponson, who advised him to make a Tour de France, a form of apprenticeship where an artisan works for a series of different masters in different locations. Perdiguier also began to learn to draw. Agricol Perdiguier undertook his tour of France from 1824 to 1828. He left Avignon on 20 April 1824 bound for Marseille. He became a compagnon on All Saints Day in Montpellier under the name of Avignonnais-la-vertu. He was elected a full compagnon in Chartres, then a first compagnon in Lyon on Christmas 1827. He left Lyon on 17 August 1828 after eleven months in that city, and reached Mori√®res on 24 August 1828. Public figure During his tour Perdiguier taught himself by reading the classical authors, and learned about the different places he visited. He wrote about the need for reconciliation of the different societies, which were sometimes engaged in bitter and bloody fights. He also wanted intellectual and moral improvement of compagnons, and of the working classes in general. In 1839 he published his writings as Le livre du compagnonnage (The book of the brotherhoods). Much of the book consists of songs and texts preaching brotherhood. His message influenced writers such as George Sand and Eug√®ne Sue. He was initiated to Freemasonry on March 17, 1846, at \\"Hospital of Palestine\\", a Supreme Council of France lodge in Paris.Journal de la Grande Loge de France, issue 66, April 2006, page 8Histoire de la franc- ma√ßonnerie en France, page 298 (Achille Ricker, Nouvelles √©ditions latine, Paris 1967) After the French Revolution of 1848, Perdiguier was elected to the Constituent Assembly on 29 April 1848 for both Vaucluse and the Seine. He chose the Seine. In this election, only 285 out of 851 of the new deputies had been republicans before the revolution, and only six candidates of the radical republicans were elected. They were Ferdinand Flocon, Martin, Blanc, Caussidi√®re, Ledru-Rollin and Agricol Perdiguier. Perdiguier was re-elected to the Legislative Assembly on 13 March 1849. He sat with the moderate left, and defended limits to the length of work days against the Conservatives. After the coup of 2 December 1851 in which Napoleon III seized power, Perdiguier was among the proscribed Republicans. He was arrested at his home, and on 9 January 1852 was expelled from the country. Last years Grave of Perdiguier in P√®re-Lachaise - Division 85 Perdiguier spent some time in Belgium and then Geneva. He drafted his autobiography in Antwerp in 1852, and it was serialized in a Swiss magazine. M√©moires d'un compagnon (Memoirs of a Compagnon) appeared as a book in 1854 and was immediately acclaimed, becoming the best known autobiography of a worker in French. The book describes his journey around France as a young journeyman, discusses the architecture of the cities he lived in, and gives anecdotes that illustrate the everyday life of a journeyman, which he had already described in his Livre du Compagnonnage. He also describes the quarrels between the different brotherhoods, and gives his views on morality and politics. His account provides a valuable record of the worker's brotherhoods of the time, and has been reprinted many times. Perdiguier returned to France in December 1855, and opened a small bookshop in Paris. In 1863 he undertook a third tour of France, visiting Avignon and Mori√®res. The last years of his life were difficult, and spent in obscurity. Perdiguier remained a Republican and a deist. During the defense of Paris in 1871 he was appointed deputy mayor of the 12th arrondissement. He was hostile to the Paris Commune. He died of a stroke in Paris on 26 March 1875, in a state of destitution. He is buried in the P√®re-Lachaise Cemetery.

History  One story of its origin is: \\"A young man harvested bright yellow fruit from a tree for his mother. When he brought that fruit to eat for dinner, it was missing, but despite this the house still smelled of the fruit. He wanted his mother to taste this fruit so he goes back to the tree while a full moon was out. When he got to the tree, a woman was there who wanted the fruit as well. She said that her father would be grateful if she gave him some of the fruit, so they both took some home. After that day, in every full moon, the young man went to the tree and met the woman while they both harvest fruit. They fell in love and married.\\" According to legend this fruit brings happiness and gratitude. See also * List of Thai desserts  References   Sources  * Freya. (2013, December 10) * C.

The name of Maccabi was given to the club, as the founders were members of Maccabi Bulgaria, the only Jewish sports association in their country of origin, Bulgaria. The club joined Liga Gimel at the 1954‚Äì55 season, in which they finished runners-up at the Central division and promoted to Liga Bet, which became the third tier of Israeli football following restructuring of the Israeli football league system. After six seasons playing in Liga Bet, Maccabi won the South A division in the 1960‚Äì61 season and qualified for the Promotion play-offs, where they beat S.K. Nes Tziona in two legs, 2‚Äì0 and 2‚Äì1, and promoted to Liga Alef, then the second tier. In Liga Alef, the club narrowly avoided relegation in the 1961‚Äì62 season after twelfth-place finish.

The club suffered further relegation in the 1963‚Äì64 season, this time to Liga Gimel, after finished bottom of Liga Bet South B division.

Initially it consisted of a large council of experts with a small administrative team whose purpose was to \\"advise educational services and industrial training organisations on the use of audio visual aids and media\\" but it quickly became more than this, developing projects, producing an academic journal BJET and advising government on setting up major computer aided learning programmes (NDPCAL and MEP). It was amalgamated with the Microelectronics Education Support Unit (MESU) in 1989 to form the National Council for Educational Technology (NCET which later was renamed the British Educational and Communication Technology Agency (Becta) in 1997). Formation The original Council (NCET) consisted of a chairman appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science after consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland, 31 members appointed by the former and 4 members appointed by the latter. In addition, assessors from eight government departments and educational bodies attended meetings. In 1973, as a result of the recommendations of the Hudson Working PartyCentral Arrangements for promoting Educational Technology in the United Kingdom, HMSO, 1972), the Council was a representative body, consisting of 59 people. Directors =Professor Tony Becher 1967‚Äì1969 = Tony Becher was the first Director appointedHubbard G., 1980, The Business of Educational Development, British Journal of Educational Technology, 11-3 p156 from the Nuffield Foundation\\"Educational Technology Two\\", Education + Training, Vol. 10 Iss 12 pp. 481 ‚Äì 481 =Geoffrey Hubbard 1969‚Äì1986 = Geoffrey Hubbard was appointed as Director in June 1969. He was previously an engineer and then a civil servant at the Ministry of Technology. He successfully steered the Council through its sometimes difficult relationship with government. He retired in 1986 but continued his role as Chairman of the National Extension College. =Richard Fothergill 1987‚Äì1988 = Richard Fothergill was appointed Director following his role as Director of the Microelectronics Education Programme. The British Journal of Educational Technology  The British Journal of Educational Technology (BJET) was sponsored and funded by the Council. It published its first issue in January 1970 and Professor Norman Mackenzie was its first editor and the prime mover behind its creation.Hubbard G., 1980, The Business of Educational Development, British Journal of Educational Technology, 11-3 p156 Although sponsored by the Council it always kept a strong, peer-reviewed, academic approach to its work ‚Äì as it said in its \\"Auspices\\" at the front of each volume. Whilst the British Journal of Educational Technology is supported by the Council for Educational Technology for the United Kingdom, it nevertheless reflects an independent, and not official view, of developments or opinions on educational technology. BJET continued through the decades and is now published by Blackwell and continues to publish academic articles on educational technology. Importantly its back numbers chronicle much of the history of educational technology in the UK and elsewhere.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-8535 Developing NDPCAL During the late 1960s computers were beginning to make an impact on education and John Duke, the Council's newly appointed assistant Director proposed a major initiative in computer-based learning.Hooper R., 1977, Editorial Introduction, British Journal of Educational Technology, 8-3 p164 The Council set up a Working Party to investigate the potential role of the computer and to outline a programme of research and development. Following a feasibility study the Council set out the case for a 5-year programme in 'computer-based learning' in 1969. The Government, following much discussion amongst the interested departments and an intervening general election, announced the approval of Mrs Thatcher, Secretary of State for Education and Science to a 'National Development Programme in Computer Aided Learning' in a DES press release dated 23 May 1972. Developing MEP During the late 1970s, with the rapid rise in the use of microelectronics, the Prime Minister Jim Callaghan, is reported to have asked each government department to draw up an action plan to meet the challenge of new technologies and the DES asked CET to create plans for a new programme ‚Äì the Microelectronics Education Programme.Fothergill (1988) Implications of New Technology for the School Curriculum (London, Kogan Page) The Programme was aimed at primary and secondary schools in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Although it was delayed by the change of government in 1979, Keith Joseph as Education Secretary finally approved it in 1980 and in March a four-year programme for schools, costing ¬£9 million. Publications As well as BJET CET published a range of publications, many the result of projects it set up and funded.

Water flowed out of the pond through Baisley Creek towards Baisley Pond. From there, it flowed through Cornell Creek into Jamaica Bay. The stream was formed by beavers prior to human settlement. The local Lenape native word for beaver, Jameco, became the namesake of the English settlement to the north of the pond, which became known as Jamaica. Beaver Pond's namesake animal was a vital component in the colonial economy. Beaver fur attracted Dutch colonists to the region and the animal appears on the seal of New York City. English settlers arrived in the area in 1656, with permission from the New Netherlands government to build Rustdorp. Following the English takeover of the colony in 1664, the popular name Jamaica became official and the town became the seat of Queens County in 1683. The pond's oldest neighbor is Prospect Cemetery, which accepted its first interment in 1668 and continued to perform burials until 1988.Worth, Robert F. ‚ÄúAt a Legendary Cemetery, a Rare Look Behind the Gates‚Äù The New York Times May 22, 2004 Later, the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line and Atlantic Branch were built in Jamaica.

The text was published clandestinely in 1577. The date of preparation of the Discourse on Voluntary Servitude is uncertain: according to recent studies it was composed by √âtienne de La Bo√©tie during his university education. According to his closest friend Michel de Montaigne, the speech was written when La Bo√©tie was about 18 years old.Murray Rothbard, Introduction to The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude by √âtienne de la Bo√©tie, translated by Harry Kurz, New York: Free Life Editions, 1975, note 4, republished by the Mises Institute 2002: \\"Having remained long in manuscript, the actual date of writing the Discourse of Voluntary Servitude remains a matter of dispute. It seems clear, however, and has been so accepted by recent authorities, that Montaigne's published story that La Bo√©tie wrote the Discourse at the age of eighteen or even of sixteen was incorrect. Montaigne's statement, as we shall see further below, was probably part of his later campaign to guard his dead friend's reputation by dissociating him from the revolutionary Huguenots who were claiming La Bo√©tie's pamphlet for their own. Extreme youth tended to cast the Discourse in the light of a work so youthful that the radical content was hardly to be taken seriously as the views of the author. Internal evidence as well as the erudition expressed in the work make it likely that the Discourse was written in 1552 or 1553, at the age of twenty-two, while La Bo√©tie was at the university. See Bonnefon, op. cit., pp. xxxvi-xxvii;\\" The full text of the introduction by Myrray Rothbard and of The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude may be found here: https://mises.org/library/political-thought-%C3%A9tienne-de-la-bo%C3%A9tie Content The essay argues that any tyrant remains in power while his subjects grant him that, therefore delegitimizing every form of power. The original freedom of men would be indeed abandoned by society which, once corrupted by the habit, would have preferred the servitude of the courtier to the freedom of the free man, who refuses to be submissive and to obey. This relation between domain and obedience would be resumed later by anarchist thinkers. Lew Rockwell summarizes La Bo√©tie‚Äôs political philosophy as follows: > To him, the great mystery of politics was obedience to rulers. Why in the > world do people agree to be looted and otherwise oppressed by government > overlords? It is not just fear, Boetie explains in ‚ÄúThe Discourse on > Voluntary Servitude,‚Äù for our consent is required. And that consent can be > non-violently withdrawn.Rockwell, Lew (11 February 2011), √âtienne de la > Boetie and Egypt, LewRockwell.com Influence The thought of La Bo√©tie was also taken up by many movements of civil disobedience, which drew from the concept of rebellion to voluntary servitude the foundation of its instrument of struggle. √âtienne de La Bo√©tie was one of the first to theorize and propose the strategy of non-cooperation, and thus a form of nonviolent disobedience, as a really effective weapon. 1575 Nicholas Barnaud The morning awakening of the French \\"Reveille matin des Francais\\"......herditary right of kings tempered by advice from electors of the people. He thunders against voluntary servitude in which whole people s stagnated. A servitude which Etienne de la Boetie explained by three series of factors in \\"Discourse on voluntary servitude\\" (1574-6) a) custom or acclimatisation b) reverence for religious or sacred rites which sustain or tower over tyranny C) proliferation of fear.

Ending his life in industry early he came back in 1968 to the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering as a lecturer on heat treatment. Here he established Heat Treatment laboratory introducing new heat treatment technologies in a country for the first time. Experiments done for his PhD using an experimental quenching tank built by the Swiss company Borel shifted his attention to quenching which became his main interest. His greatest scientific achievement is the invention of Temperature Gradient Method for quenching intensity measuring, recording and evaluation. Soon afterwards, an appropriate software package was developed with the aim of recording the quenching intensity for different quenchants and working conditions. This is enabled by measuring the heat flux density from a surface of a special probe developed earlier in a cooperation with the American company NANMAC, known as Liscic/NANMAC probe. The relevant computer program enables also to calculate the cooling curves at every arbitrary point of the round bar cross-section, as well as to predict the resulting microstructure and hardness after quenching.

It has flowers that come in a range of shades, from purple, to violet-blue. It has purple or violet blue falls of , that have a dark purple veining with a creamy-white/white signal patch. It has standards of , that are slightly paler than the falls, but still veined but with a pale yellow background. It has purple crested styles and a bi-lobed stigma. After flowering it produces seed capsules, these have not been described. Its germination rate can be very high, depending on the amount of moisture within the soil.British Iris Society (1997) Seedlings of both Iris masia and Iris grant-duffii initially form a small bulb with reticulate tunics (net-like coatings). In 2017, a comparison was carried out on the morphological and anatomical properties of Iris masia and Iris pamphylica (another endangered Turkish endemic iris), it was found that the leaves of both taxa have xeromorphic structure. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.} It has a chromosome count of 2n=24. Taxonomy It is occasionally known in Turkey, as the 'Barbed iris'. It was originally discovered by plant hunter, Paul Sintenis in 1888, near to the village of 'Sueverek', on the lower slopes of the Karadja Dagh, a mountain which lies in the district of Diyarbakƒ±r Province (now part of Southeastern Anatolia) of northern Mesopotamia. It was then named by Otto Stapf in 1888. Herr Max Leichtlin then gave Sir Michael Foster some specimens and Mr Foster then published it 'The Garden' (Issue 61 on page 288) on 3 May 1902 as Iris masiae (Foster). Iris masia got its name from the ancient name of its habitat, the Karadja Dagh mountain, which was once known as 'Mons Masius', (erroneously given as 'Mons Masins' by Dykes). The mountain was also known as 'Mount Masia'. It was again published and described as Iris masiae by Dykes, in the 'Gardeners Chronicle' (Issue 99) of London in 1910. In his research of his book 'The Genus Iris', Dykes then discovered that Mr Fosters Iris masiae and a Kew Garden specimen were very similar to his species of Iris grant- duffii and Iris Aschersonii. Dykes had to then publish a correction in 'Gardeners Chronicle' Issue 147 in 1910. Calling it Iris Masia. Iris Aschersonii was later treated as a synonym of Iris grant-duffii. But Iris masia was then classified as a separate species by Brian Mathew in his book of 1981 'The Iris'. It is one of only two species in the Syriacea series according to Mathew. It has been found that the species within Series Syriacae (with short fat, vertical rhizomes and terminal bulb-like buds) are derived from Iris series Tenuifoliae (another dry-land rhizomatous group of irises). There is also a genetic link between Syriacae and the bulbous ‚Äòreticulata‚Äô irises, especially with divergent Iris pamphylica, which has been confirmed by pollen similarities and rootstock morphology. A 'Sintenis' collected plant specimen is within the University of Vienna, Institute for Botany ‚Äì Herbarium, collected from Kurdistan/Iraq. Subspecies Iris masia Dykes subsp. dumaniana G√ºner was found in 2012. It was published in 'T√ºrkiye Bitkileri Listesi' p. 893‚Äì894 in 2012. It was found in Anatolia in Turkey in woody region on limestone soils, at 20m above sea level. Distribution Iris masia is native to the northwestern Middle East and Asian Turkey. Its populations are spread along the north Syrian Desert, from the southeastern Anatolia region in Turkey and northwestern inland Syria, to northeastern Syria adjacent to Iraq‚ÄîIraqi Kurdistan.Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, 1986 It grows in meadows, pastures and steppes at elevations of between above sea level. In 1946, near Aleppo in Syria, a purple variety of Iris grant-duff was found. It was originally named 'Iris caeruleo-violacea' by Paul Moutarde. This has been re-classified as a synonym of Iris masia. In a 1975 survey (by M.Agami and A.Dafni) of plants, only plants of Iris grant-duffii were recorded near the Belus River (Nahal na'aman). From two plant studies were carried out in 2001 and 2004 in Turkey. Iris masia populations in the country had a restricted distribution range, which is categorized on the IUCN Red List book of Turkey for the IUCN as 'Vulnerable'. Of the non-endemic plants are distributed only in south-east Anatolia, Iris gatesii and Iris masia, (which are known from the mountain of Karacadaƒü and its surrounding areas) have extremely restricted ranges. Iris masia is found in the southeastern Anatolia region with other monocot flowers. In 2017, it was considered 'endangered'. Cultivation Similar to Iris grant-duffii, Iris masia is rare in cultivation in the UK. It can be cultivated in deep pots, as long it has a high potash feeding, and protected from the winter rains. But in sheltered areas of Canada, it could be planted against a south-facing wall within well- drained soil. Non-sheltered areas need a Bulb frame.

John Field House built 1743 John Field's grandson, John Field (born 1714), built a stone house at 625 River Road in 1743. A later addition was wood frame construction. Benjamin McDowell Field House in 1960 About 1868, Benjamin McDowell Field built a large two-story frame house along River Road. It was also known as the Kenneth Perry House, named after its last owner. The house was destroyed by fire in 1965. Fieldville Dam As part of the Delaware and Raritan Canal, a dam was constructed on the Raritan River at Fieldville to supply water for the last five miles of the canal to New Brunswick. What remains of the dam can still be seen in the Raritan River, about 500 feet upstream from the I-287 North overpass near exit 10.

It was designed by engineer E. G. Stone and erected from 1913-1915. It would appear to be the only one of its kind in Australia in terms of its length and the use of the Considere construction technique. The aqueduct appears to be the last example in Australia of Armand Considere's system of reinforcing for concrete structures. It was added to the Victorian Heritage Register on 23 October 1991. Description The Barwon Sewer Aqueduct straddles the Barwon River flood plain at Breakwater, south of Geelong. According to the literature, it is the longest and largest structure built according to the Considere system. The aqueduct comprises 14 spans over a length of 750 metres (2,424 feet). Each pier is the centre of a cantilevered truss, the gap between trusses bridged by girders carrying the ovoid concrete sewer pipe and a walkway, both of which span the bridge. In contrast to the straightforward expression of structure in the cantilevered trusses and walkway, the piers are capped by simple architectural forms which echo the details of Egyptian pylons and Classical Triumphal Arches. In keeping with many such early reinforced concrete bridges and engineering works (as opposed to buildings) the aqueduct could have been executed at a much larger scale and still retained its visual qualities. Bridges such as the Loddon Bridge (1911), Victoria, and the Railway Bridge (1910) near Lockyer Creek, Queensland, are good, contemporary examples which share this quality, which in some cases could be equated with the simplicity of the earlier, timber trestle-bridges. History The last decade of the nineteenth century and the first two decades of the twentieth century were a period of rapid urban development in the major cities, requiring investment in urban infrastructure including railways, roads and water, electricity and gas and in sewerage systems. Developments in Sydney and Melbourne were reflected at a regional level in large towns and cities such as Geelong in Victoria. The Geelong Commissioners appointed to implement a sewerage scheme for Geelong visited the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works and the Sydney Board in July 1910. A visit was also made to Adelaide in September 1910. On 1 June 1910, surveyor Charles Campbell Breen had already begun work on the survey alignment for a sewer to serve Geelong. The Geelong Commissioners obtained permission for the Boards engineer, Mr C. E. Oliver, to report on the feasibility of using a sewerage farm at Geelong. Mr Oliver concluded that it was practicable to do so at Point Henry, but did not go so far as to recommend doing so. Mr Oliver had acted as a Royal Commissioner into the Perth Sewerage System in July 1909 (Cooke, 1981: 56-69). One of the first steps in the sewerage scheme for the Geelong Waterworks and Sewerage Trust District was the fixing of appropriate boundaries in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Act. Boundaries were approved in November 1910 and encompassed an area of 8,081 acres. The area at Werribee servicing Melbourne was of the order of 26,000 acres. The Royal Commission on Sanitation in Britain had recently studied the issue of discharge into streams of faecal matter. Mr R. T. Mackay, Chief Engineer to the Geelong Water Works and Sewerage Trust, was aware that the flow of the Barwon River did not permit the necessary standards except for limited periods. A survey of the coastal currents along the coast was carried out by Mr Breen, as an alternative way of discharging treated sewage. The final recommendation by Mr Mackay was that an ocean outfall was the best way of sewage disposal while the simplicity of the scheme made for economy. The estimated cost of the outfall proposal was ‚Ç§285,992 compared to ‚Ç§261,878 for a sewerage farm. The successful contractor, Messrs Stone and Siddeley, established a factory adjacent to the railway at Geelong to manufacture the pre-cast sections of sewer pipe, also winning the contract to lay the pipes in some areas as well as that for the design and construction of an aqueduct across the Barwon River. Mr R. Taylor, the forerunner of Rocla Pipes, another concrete product manufacturer, was also involved in the work of supplying and laying sewage pipes as well as the construction of pumping stations (Cooke, 1981: 56-69). Designed in 1912 by Mr E. G. Stone, and constructed from 1913-1915 at a tender cost of ‚Ç§18,450, the Barwon Sewer Aqueduct was described in January 1916 in the Commonwealth Engineer. Geelong had recently installed a sewerage scheme in which reinforced concrete was widely used and in which it was necessary to cross the River Barwon and the river flats with the sewer line. On the recommendation of Mr R. T. Mackay, Chief Engineer to the Water Works and Sewerage Trust, it was decided to erect an aqueduct. Alternative prices in steel and concrete were submitted, the Trust accepting the design and tender of Mr Stone, Engineer for Messrs Stone and Siddeley, Reinforced Concrete Specialists of Sydney, with branches in Tasmania and South Australia (Stone, 1920: 49-51). The accepted structure was designed on the cantilever principle to cross the river and its flats, a length of 2,424 feet, with fourteen spans; thirteen were to be 176 feet and one of 136 feet. It was stated that one of the advantages was that the movement caused by temperature variations would not impact on the appearance or function of the sewer, which would have a grade of 1 in 2,500, when compared to steel construction. The cantilevers were to be splayed, to take account of horizontal wind stresses. The pre-cast concrete pipes (ovoid to achieve maximum hydraulic efficiency), in 8 foot lengths, were to be built into the structure. Trial bores along the site of the aqueduct showed that rock existed from 5‚Äì40 feet below the surface. However, reinforced concrete piles were to be used to support the bases of the piers. The reinforcement throughout was to be of ordinary commercial steel rods, which were lapped rather than joined into continuous bars. The steel rods in the upper booms of the cantilevers were arranged in concentric rings around the longitudinal rods. The gaps between each cantilever section were to be spanned by a 40-foot girder section fixed at one end, but free to move at the other. An expansion joint was to be provided at each span, its design being similar to that of an ordinary ‚Äòstuffing box‚Äô. A footpath, acting as a structural form, would be provided throughout the whole length of the structure. At the time of its completion it would be considered one of the finest concrete structures in Australia (Stone, 1920: 49-51). The Barwon Sewer Aqueduct was commissioned in 1916 and decommissioned in 1972. The viaduct and its surroundings were entered in the Historic Buildings Register, Victoria, in 1981. Condition and integrity The Barwon Sewer Aqueduct has become an issue in terms of its condition and the cost of conservation, although it is still of relatively high integrity. The structure was repaired continuously from 1977-1980 using shotcrete to cover reinforcing exposed by spalling of the concrete through fumes and carbonation. The loss of cover to reinforcing appears to be limited for the most part to vertical and diagonal members of the trusses where the members are smaller in cross section. A report completed in 1995 for Barwon Water concluded that, due to its condition, there was no factor of safety and the structure could collapse at any time. This was contested by the Institution of Engineers. An Inquiry in 1996, however, found that the aqueduct should not be demolished. The Geelong Aqueduct Committee supports restoration of the aqueduct; the owners, Barwon Water, have estimated the initial cost of repair and maintenance at $7.94 million in 2005, with ongoing maintenance costs of $2.2 million for 30 years.

History In 1875 Matthias Robinson opened a drapery shop on Lynn Street, Hartlepool. He quickly expanded the business by taking on the store next door, before buying the large building next to his store and calling it Lynn House. On the advice of doctors, Matthias moved his family to Stockton on Tees due to his wife's health condition and in 1896, a new store was opened in Stockton-on-Tees as the first Robinsons department store. The two houses that were converted on Stockton High Street were destroyed by fire in December 1899, but a new store was completely rebuilt on the same site re-opening in May 1901. The new store had 48 departments, a restaurant and a cafe. The building was designed by Barnes & Coates of Sunderland with the assistance of W. Basil Scott and is an early example of steel frame construction in England.The Development of Steel Framed Buildings in Britain 1880- 1905 by Alastair A Jackson By 1912, the Hartlepool business had grown further with premises opening on the opposite side of Lynn Street, which Matthias called The Coliseum and buildings on Whitby Street which he named Birmingham House. The business continued to grow and in 1914 opened a new department store in Briggate, Leeds.A History of Modern Leeds by Derek Fraser This store was later expanded in 1938 by purchasing neighbouring department store H & D Hart. After the death of Matthias in 1929, his sons took over the running of the business with his son Cyril running the Stockton branch until he retired. The Stockton branch was then run by his grandson, Lionel, who was later responsible for negotiating the sale of the business to Debenhams. The Leeds store was run by another of Mathias's grandsons, Cecil. The business expanded in 1961 with the purchase of Bainbridge Barker, a quality department store in Darlington, which was renamed Matthias Robinson. The following year Debenhams purchased all four stores of Matthias Robinson for ¬£2.8 million. The stores continued to operate under the Matthias Robinson or Robinsons name, with the Hartlepool store being closed and demolished in the late 1960s. In 1973, as part of a wider rationalisation and rebranding exercise, the Darlington store was closed and the Robinson name was dropped in favour of Debenhams at the two remaining stores which continue to trade. On 26 April 2019, it was announced the Stockton branch would close in 2020 as one of 22 to be closed.

It has the following properties: * It works for any number (n) of partners. * It works for any set of weights representing different entitlements of the partners. * The pieces are not necessarily connected, i.e. each partner might receive a collection of small \\"crumbs\\". * The number of queries is finite but unbounded ‚Äì it is not known in advance how many queries will be needed. The protocol was developed by Jack M. Robertson and William A. Webb. It was first published in 1997 and later in 1998.  Problem definition  A cake C has to be divided among n agents. Each agent i has: * A value- measure Vi on subsets of C; * A weight wi representing the fraction of C to which the agent is entitled. The sum of all wi is 1. If all agents have the same rights, then wi = 1/n for all i, but in general the weights may be different. It is required to partition C into n subsets, not necessarily connected, such that, for every two agents i and h: > V_i(X_i) / w_i \\\\geq V_i(X_h) / w_h So i does not envy j when taking their different entitlements into account.Robertson and Webb do not state this definition explicitly, but it follows from equations (10.1), (10.2), (10.3), (10.4) and the text following them in page 131. In our notation, these equations imply: \\\\begin{align} V_i(X_i)\\\\geq w_i V_i(X)  V_i(X_h)\\\\leq w_h V_i(X)  V_h(X_h)\\\\geq w_h V_h(X)  V_h(X_i)\\\\leq w_i V_h(X) \\\\end{align}  Details  The main difficulty in designing an envy-free procedure for n > 2 agents is that the problem is not \\"divisible\\". I.e., if we divide half of the cake among n/2 agents in an envy-free manner, we cannot just let the other n/2 agents divide the other half in the same manner, because this might cause the first group of n/2 agents to be envious (e.g., it is possible that A and B both believe they got 1/2 of their half which is 1/4 of the entire cake; C and D also believe the same way; but, A believes that C actually got the entire half while D got nothing, so A envies C). The Robertson‚ÄìWebb protocol addresses this difficulty by requiring that the division is not only envy-free but also near-exact. The recursive part of the protocol is the following subroutine. = Inputs = * Any piece of cake X; * Any Œµ > 0; * n players, A1, ‚Ä¶, An; * m ‚â§ n players which are identified as \\"active players\\", A1, ‚Ä¶, Am (the other n ‚àí m players are identified as \\"watching players\\"); * Any set of m positive weights w1, ‚Ä¶, wm; = Output = A partition of X to pieces X1, ‚Ä¶, Xm, assigned to the m active players, such that: * For every active player i and every other player h (active or watching): > V_i(X_i) / w_i \\\\geq V_i(X_h) / w_h So agent i does not envy agent h when taking their different entitlements into account. * The division is Œµ-near-exact with the given weights among all n players ‚Äì both active and watching. = Procedure = Note: the presentation here is informal and simplified. A more accurate presentation is given in the book. Use a near-exact division procedure on X and get a partition which all n players view as Œµ-near-exact with weights w1, ‚Ä¶, wm. Let one of the active players (e.g. A1) cut the pieces such that the division is exact for him, i.e. for every j: V1(Xj)/V1(X) = wj. If all other active players agree with the cutter, then just give piece Xi to active player Ai. This division is envy- free among the active players, so we are done. Otherwise, there is some piece P on which there is disagreement among the active players. By cutting P to smaller pieces if necessary, we may bound the disagreement such that all players agree that: V(P)/V(X) < Œµ. Split the active players to two camps: the \\"optimists\\" who think that P is more valuable, and the \\"pessimists\\" who think that P is less valuable. Let Œ¥ be the difference between the values, such that for every optimist i and every pessimist j: Vi(P)/Vi(X) ‚Äì Vj(P)/Vj(X) > Œ¥. Divide the remaining cake, X ‚àí P, into pieces Q and R, such that the division is near-exact among all n players. Assign P ‚à™ Q to the optimists. Because they believe that P is valuable, they necessarily believe that P ‚à™ Q is sufficiently valuable to more than cover their due share. Assign R to the pessimists. Because they believe that P is less valuable, they necessarily believe that the remainder, R, is sufficiently valuable to more than cover their due share. At this point we have partitioned the active players to two camps, each collectively claiming complementary portions of the cake and each camp is more than satisfied with their collective portion. It remains to divide each portion of the cake to the players in its camp. This is done by two recursive applications of the procedure: * Recursively partition P ‚à™ Q among the optimists (i.e. the optimists are active and all other players are only watching). * Recursively partition R among the pessimists. In both applications, the near-exactness factor should be at most Œ¥. Because the resulting partition is Œ¥-near-exact among all n players, the partition among the optimists doesn't cause envy among the pessimists and vice versa. Thus the over-all division is both envy-free and near-exact.  See also  * Brams‚ÄìTaylor protocol ‚Äì another envy-free protocol with disconnected pieces and finite unbounded runtime. Does not guarantee near-exactness. * Simmons‚ÄìSu protocols ‚Äì envy-free protocol which guarantees connected pieces but the runtime might be infinite. Does not guarantee near-exactness.

Lolita arrives on Earth and meets 3 college roommates Sara (Christine Nguyen), Brandy (Karlie Montana), and Joe (Seth Gamble) that agree to let Lolita move in with them. While Sara and Brandy are at work Joe teaches Lolita about sex at the pool. Afterward she teleports back to her home planet and found it easier to show her professor what she had learned rather than explain it verbally. He instructs her to watch how humans have sex and then teleports her back to Earth. When Lolita returns she goes with Brandy to shadow her at her job as a candy striper at the nearby hospital where they encounter Mr. Reynolds (Alec Knight), a patient that is interested in Brandy. Lolita uses her special power of suggestion to get Brandy to break hospital rules and have sex with Reynolds. After they return home Lolita goes to the local pub where Sara and Joe work and meets Sara's boyfriend, Greg (Chad White), and decides to have sex with him. After they are done she agrees to find out if Sara loves him or is only interested in his money. The next day Lolita and Sara are sunning by the pool and Lolita finds out that Sara does love him and tells Greg that night at the pub.

About 30% of sudden cardiac deaths in young people are not explained after full conventional autopsy, and are classified as sudden unexplained deaths. The use of a panel of genetic markers for long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and cardiac channel miopathies elucidated around 40 to 45% of the cases.  Ethics  In today‚Äôs day and age the use of Molecular Autopsy has come with its share of ethical issues. The issues are raised because there are no set laws that a Medical Examiner must follow. For instance it is not required for an examiner to get permission from a relative to go forth with a molecular autopsy. This has created many issues for families because they may not always want to know the results of why a loved one died. Knowing this information can create anxiety and concern for family members over a possible mutation of their own gene that could cause their death, while they would have no way of stopping it. It also creates an issue because with most if not all examinations, samples of a test are retained in a lab. This means the tests from a loved one is saved forever, to be possibly used in a different experiment. The family usually has no say on whether this will happen or not. The problem that arises for medical examiners is that if an examination is done and the lives of family members could be at risk, they have no authorization to tell the family if they do not wish to know. Some examiners believe that this is against their duty as a professional doctor. For example, it has been estimated that 30% of young sudden cardiac deaths can be traced to being inherited. So doctors feel that it is against their profession to not let someone know when they could be at risk.McGuire, Amy L., Quianta Moore, Mary Majumder, Magdalena Walkiewicz, Christine M. Eng, John W.

Genome Research. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Sept. 2016. Web. 21 Apr. 2017.  Methods  When a traditional medical autopsy is not able to determine the sudden cause of death, molecular autopsy may help provide an alternative insight through the use of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing. It looks at things from a cellular level instead of only what the human eye can see. The first step in performing a molecular autopsy is to obtain a sample of blood or tissue from the individual after death has occurred. DNA is then extracted from the blood sample in order to undergo a process of genetic sequencing. Then, the DNA sequence is carefully analyzed to detect any gene mutations that may be a cause of sudden death. Initially, molecular autopsy focused on the direct DNA sequencing of four genes. However, recent advancements in sequencing technologies have made it possible to screen a large number of genes at once from a small sample of DNA through whole-exome sequencing (WES) in which the coding regions of all 22,000 genes are sequenced. This potentially allows the detection of genetic variants of genes related to all major diseases.Lahrouchi, Najim, Elijah R. Behr, and Connie R. Bezzina. ‚ÄúNext-Generation Sequencing in Post-Mortem Genetic Testing of Young Sudden Cardiac Death Cases.‚Äù Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 3 (2016): 13. PMC. Web. 2 Apr. 2017.  Case Studies  A study of sudden death brought a mother to once question whether her thirteen-year-old son has what previously killed her seventeen-year-old son. This son had been found lying in bed dead with an autopsy that was inconclusive. Many blamed it on drug use and abuse, but that was really not the cause. PQRST complex of a heart beat Almost half the sudden deaths of previously healthy children have no findings on autopsy. These children are referred to as having sudden unexplained death syndrome (SUDS). In the Olmsted County population study, six of the twelve cases died of unknown causes of SUDS. A lot of forensic pathologists blame a fatal arrhythmia of the heart to be the cause of SUDS due to the lethal disorders like long QT syndrome (LQTS). This is a prolonged QT interval in the heart‚Äôs natural rhythm. This is can leave no trace for an autopsy. The clinical signs of LQTS are syncope, seizures, or sudden death. In England there are around 200 SUDS cases yearly, and nearly a third of those were blamed on LQTS. This however, cannot be proved without an electrocardiogram before death. By looking at the molecular level of the issues that cause SUDS and/or LQTS, they may be able to find the ion channels that are cardiac defective. There are six LQTS genetic markers, five LQTS genes, and around 200 mutations identified all in patients with LQTS. By targeting these molecules, molecular autopsy can be possible. This is how molecular autopsy is relevant in all three of the following cases. = Case 1 = In this case of the mother with questions of her living son possible having the same issue that her now dead son had, there was a history of these LQTS clinical signs that were stated above in the family. Specifically, the grandmother had syncopal episodes multiple times. Although, multiple electrocardiograms showed no significant findings that would lead to a diagnosis of LQTS. There were multiple studies done, one in particular was the epinephrine-triggered alterations in repolarization. This showed the results of having five nucleotides (guanine [g], cytosine [c], guanine, cytosine, and thymidine [t]) from positions 735 - 739 were not present. These are the genetic components of DNA. This resulted in the cardiac potassium channel to cause a shift of amino acids. This shift is where the stop codon at an amino acid is introduced and needed. This can severely impact the depolarization and repolarization of the heart, which is crucial for the normal rhythm of the muscle.Ackerman, Michael J., MD, PhD, David J. Tester, BS, and David J. Driscoll, MD. \\"Molecular Autopsy of Sudden Unexplained Death in the Young : The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology.\\" LWW. American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology, June 2001. Web. 20 Mar. 2017. = Case 2 = Another study was done for molecular autopsy on the RyR2-encoded cardiac ryanodine receptor in SUDS. There were 49 cases in this study, 30 of which were male. Thirteen of the 49 studied had a family history of syncope. In seven of these cases of SUDS, there were six distinct RyR2 missense mutations. During these deaths, the activities were as follows: three cases of exertion, one case of emotion, and three unknown cases. This study was of the first on RyR2 in molecular autopsy. It targeted 18 of the 105 protein-encoding exons of the cardiac ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel. This revealed one in every seven to be positive for the RyR2 mutations in SUDS. This studied showed that testing of this mutation should be a part of the autopsy investigation. This study also proved that this mutation is possibly inheritable.Tester, David J., BS, Daniel B. Spoon, BS, Hector H. Valdivia, MD, PhD, Jonathan C. Makelski, MD, and Michael J.

N.p., 2004. Web. = Case 3 = Another study is the pharmacogenomics as molecular autopsy for forensic toxicology. This study is looking at the genotyping of cytochrome P450 3A4*1B and 3A5*3. Pharmacogenetics is the study of genetic contributions to drug action. This can help in certifying a fentanyl toxicity. Fentanyl is used for anesthesia in surgery or pain control/management in animals and humans. This drug can have variable metabolisms due to the different alleles in the cytochrome P450. This study looked at 25 different fentanyl related deaths (22 caucasians, 1 African American, and 2 Native Americans). from the Milwaukee county medical Examiner‚Äôs office and referrals. Blood was taken and analyzed after death by radioimmunoassay and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. This study showed the average fentanyl concentration in CYP3A4*1B wild type and 3A5*3 homozygous variant cases were higher than those of the CYP3A4*1B variant cases (this was not a significant difference). The data taken from this study gave scientific evidence that CYP3A5 is involved in the fentanyl metabolism, where as the homozygous CYP3A5*3 causes impaired metabolism of fentanyl. Genotyping CYP3A4*1B and 3A5*3 variants may help to certify the fentanyl toxicity. For further studying of this subject, there will be more cases needed. This study was mainly to supply information for this drug monitoring and pain management.Jin, Ming, Susan B. Gock, Paul J. Jannetto, Jeffrey M. Jentzen, and Steven H.

Web. = Relationship with molecular autopsy = Molecular autopsy has become a huge component in the investigation process of SUD, specifically sudden cardiac death (SCD). The causes of SCD range widely but the greatest contributor to SCD is an underlying genetic predisposition, especially in those under the age of 40. The inherited diseases include, but are not limited to, primary arrythmogenic disorders and inherited cardiomyopathies. Molecular autopsy not only helps identify an explanation for SUD, but evaluates the potential risks that relatives may have in relation to cardiovascular disease. Over 3 million people die of SCD a year, making molecular autopsy for SCD in high demand. Using molecular autopsy for SCD in the young, fit, and seemingly healthy individual is an increasingly interesting topic for research. Up to 30% of the autopsies given post-mortem to young individuals who die of SCD have no cause of death identified, called autopsy-negative or sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS). This is because many primary arrhythmogenic disorders do not cause structural damage to the heart, making it difficult for pathologists to draw a conclusion on the cause of death. Genetic testing for SADS cases started over ten years ago. A sample of the cadaver‚Äôs blood is taken and tested. The molecular autopsy focuses on four main genes: KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, and RYR2. Greater than 95% of the mutations found in the molecular autopsy are a chromosome dominant trait, indicating that half of the children to the tested individual also carry the mutated gene.Semsarian, Christopher, and Robert M.

She came to fame after Guten Morgen, Du Sch√∂ne (Good Morning My Lovely) was published, and remains an important figure in East German literature after her death from cancer. Biography Grave of Maxie and Fred Wander in Kleinmachnow Cemetery Wander had a rough time in the early stages of her life as she left school at seventeen years old in order to make a living. She was in and out of a number of jobs as a factory worker, a secretary for a company and also a writer for some film scripts. She had no signs of turning her life around to something worth more until she met a Holocaust survivor, who became her husband, Fred Wander. They had three children, and began writing travel books and other journalism. Fred inspired Maxie to become an author that she always wanted to be. In the early to mid 1970s Maxie conducted a large number of interviews with women of all ages in order to help her with her book. She spent much time collecting this material as she wanted to become an important part as a documentary and women's literature writer in Germany. She then published her first book, Guten Morgen, Du Sch√∂ne (Good Morning My Lovely), which contained 19 monologues by different women talking about their life day in and day out. In the monologues which Wander recorded in her book were women expressing their opinions and concerns in society about topics such as sexism, diversity, stress placed on woman and other controversial issues that women go through that they may not feel comfortable about talking to their husband or friends about each day, so they kept these emotions built up inside of them. The book also talked about other sensitive subjects such as suicide and mental breakdown. This book, obviously designed for a female readership, sold 60,000 within one year in just the GDR alone. This shows the effect that her work had on women may have been dealing with these issues. Her book was published in 1977, the same year she was suffering from incurable cancer. She ended up dying that same year the book was published, but was able to get a chance to experience the immediate glory and positive feedback from her book. She was able to write letters of more issues to her fans as she was sick in the hospital. The effect she had on GDR in such a short period of time was like no other all because the turn around in her life to go reach for her dream to become a writer.

It was designed by John Young and built in 1861 by Jones and Halpin. It is no longer used as a synagogue, but has been refurbished and is in use as offices. It was listed on the Victorian Heritage Register on 14 September 1995. Significance and history The synagogue is a particularly distinctive and important architectural design, in the Italianate style and in the eclectic and diverse manner of the architect John Young. The building is of social importance as the Synagogue of Geelong and in the history of the Jewish community in the area. It is a comparatively early building in Geelong and is of some importance in the surrounding townscape. The structure exhibits a detailing which is uncommon in buildings of this period, including the detailing to the side bays and particularly the corner piers and the broken pediment with its heavy brackets above the semi- circular gable light. There is a stucco porch with distinctive and prominent classically derived details. The form of the round headed side windows is unusual and the glazing pattern distinctive. The interior is believed to be intact and is notable for its exposition of the architect styles used for buildings of the smaller religious congregations during the nineteenth century. The synagogue is a four bayed structure with gables to either end, an advancing stuccoed porch and an apse to the other end. The walls are stuccoed and the roof is of slate. The corners of the main facade feature prominent piers elaborately decorated with recessed shafts, prominent string courses and other mouldings, recessed panels and prominent and distinctive brackets supporting the broken pediment motif above. The porch is also stuccoed and features prominent quoins, bourgeois and architrave moulding, round headed paired entrance doors, string course on brackets and a parapet. Above the porch is a large semi-circular window with prominent key stone and architrave mouldings. The side walls are arranged with recessed panels about each round headed window, surmounted by large key-stones and brackets in the form of dentals. There is a string course beneath the windows which feature an elaborate pattern of glazing bars and coloured glass. The interior is restrained and the apse is framed by a circular arch on Corinthian based pilasters. The structure was built in 1861 to the designs of architects John Young and F. T. Honey, practising as Young and Honey and the builders were Jones and Halpin. The foundation stone was laid on 22 July 1861 and the Synagogue was consecrated on 1 December 1861. This building replaced an earlier wooden building erected at the corner of Yarra and McKillop Streets, Geelong, which was consecrated on 1 June 1854. The building is intact both externally and internally and is in good condition. Description The synagogue is a single-storey gabled building with an apsidal extension on the eastern gable end. The roof is of slate and the brick walls have been cement rendered. A rectangular, flat-roofed, porch extends westward from the main gable end. It is enframed in much the same way as entrance doors to early homes in Ohio in the United States. The raking cornice of the gable forms an overhanging eave and a broken horizontal cornice is supported on either side by a pier giving the impression of a pediment. The latter is emphasised by prominent modillions, which are also used below the projecting cornice of the porch. Within the tympanum is a Diocletian window, common in Palladian architecture, with a moulded architrave and keystone. The piers are astylar and though prominent are decorated in low relief. In plan form they resemble early nave piers of the Norman period. The engaged colonettes enframe a rectangular moulding with a central circle. This decorative element was commonly used in early Italian renaissance architecture as well as subsequent adaptations. The small circular reliefs used in the upper section of the pier are most unusual and may be simplified version of the patera, commonly used motifs in the Adam style. They have been replicated in an exceptional manner in the stained glass windows. The elevation of the porch is overwhelmed by quoining especially by the Gibbs surround of the round-arched entrance. Above the paired wooden doors is a plain fanlight with a Hebrew inscription. The side walls are externally divided into four bays by plain pilasters. Within each bay is a round-arched window with a sill course below and keystone above which is extended to a wide string course. The string course, with dentils below, runs the full length of the side walls. This is an element common to many of Young's works including the Golden Age and Argyle Hotels. An unusual decorative element, however, is the stepping of the string course to represent a capital on the pilasters. Together with the dentils it appears to be a representation of ionic volutes. Such a treatment of classical elements is not unusual in Young's work. Internally there is a curved stained wood ceiling with a semi circular cut-out to a low light to enter from the Diocletian window above the balcony. Below the balcony is a vestibule, a small room and the staircase. The building is slightly water damaged. At the time it was assessed for the former Register of the National Estate, the local Jewish community wished to demolish the building (which stands on a grant of Crown land) because of the cost of upkeep and the tiny congregation, so it was not used for other purposes. The building remains, has been refurbished, and is now being used as offices. Because Young built the first synagogue and the similarities in style with his other buildings the synagogue is attributed to Young alone (rather than Young and Honey).

The collective art work of his workshop, which continued after his death, was signed Atelier Faria. Life and career =Brazil= Faria was born in 1846, the eldest of four children of physician Jos√© C√¢ndido Faria (-1855) and Josefa Aragonez, who was of Spanish extraction.Biography of Faria on Cartoonvirtualmuseum.org and Lu√≠z Ant√¥nio Barreto: C√¢ndido Aragonez de Faria, infonet.com.br are used throughout this section Dr. Faria had studied in Montpelier and specialised in cholera. He founded the Hospital de Caridade de Laranjeiras and died in a cholera epidemic in 1855. The family moved to Rio de Janeiro, where their relatives lived. There young C√¢ndido studied at the Liceu de Artes e Of√≠cios (School of Arts and Crafts) and at the Escola de Belas Artes (Fine-Arts School). Faria's very productive career started with his artwork for many magazines satirizing local politicians and the clergy in Rio de Janeiro, like Paul Gavarni and Honor√© Daumier did in France. He began as a main caricaturist in 1866 for the satirical periodical A Pacotilha (English: Fake, later Pandokeu (Joker)). In September 1869 he started with his brother Adolfo the weekly O Mosquito (The Mosquito). In April 1871 he bought O Lobisomen (The Werewolf) from the lithographer Ant√≥nio Alves do Vale. Faria and Vale signed some works together. Then in June 1874 Faria started a new weekly 0 Mefist√≥feles as the sole illustrator, to be merged with O Mosquito in 1875. From 1869 through 1874 Faria was one of the illustrators of the magazine A Vida Fluminense (Life in Rio de Janeiro), since 1874 O F√≠garo, for which he became the sole illustrator. Since October 1876, Faria supplied cartoons to the weeklies O Ganganelli and O Mequetrefe (The Coxcomb). In 1877 he founded the magazine O Diabrete (The Goblin). Faria worked also for more ephemeral magazines, such as A Com√©dia Popular (The people's comedy), A Galeria (The Gallery), Ziguezague and Ba-Ta-Clan (The Hotchpotch). =Argentina= During 1879 - 1882, Faria illustrated in Buenos Aires the main satiric weekly El Mosquito and the new magazine Cotorra (English: parrot, windbag), introducing chromolithography in South America. Later he obtained the right to exclusively illustrate the artistic and literary weekly El Correo del Domingo (Sunday Post) and the daily El Gr√°fico (~ The graph). =France= In 1882 Faria emigrated to France and established his workshop at Paris, working with Charles Cl√©rice of the Cl√©rice Fr√®res illustrators. Faria gained fame by his illustrations for books (e.g., Le fils de Porthos by Paul Mahalin, L'enfant d'Une vierge by Alfred Sirven, and Pour rire √† deux by Olympe Audouard) and magazines (La Caricature by Albert Robida, Le Papillon, Le Monde illustr√© and La Musique pour tous). But Faria also illustrated many editions of sheet music for the singer Paulus (Jean-Paul Habans) and created the portrait of the singer Mont√©hus used for numerous covers. He also illustrated sheet music for songs, romances and operettas by Justin Cl√©rice, Louis Ganne, Charles Lecocq, Olivier M√©tra, Edmond Missa, Robert Planquette, Vincent Scotto and others. Since 1895, Faria and the lithographers Seba√Øn and Axelrod created posters for shows, tourism and general advertising. From 1902 up to his death in 1911 he was, with about 300 posters, the main poster designer for the film company Path√© (Les Victimes de l'alcoolisme by Ferdinand Zecca, L'assommoir based on Emile Zola, and so on). In France Faria married and had a son Jacques, artist and father of Philippe Aragonez de Faria, who would curate his father's and grandfather's work.

It was first introduced in the scientific literature by Drs. Harry Harlow and John Bromer in 1938. Origin The Wisconsin General Test Apparatus was created in the 1930s at the Harlow Center for Biological Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The development of the device is credited to Drs. Paul Settlage and Walter Grether, and Drs.Harry Harlow and John Bromer are credited with the first publication about the device in 1938, where it gained much notoriety. It was originally designed for testing learning in non-human primates. In particular, the WGTA was intended for use with Rhesus monkeys. Design The Wisconsin General Test Apparatus is a piece of laboratory equipment designed to allow both the subject and the researcher to interact in a controlled environment, while conducting an assortment of memory and learning tests. The apparatus is constructed of two independent square compartments. One of which is a flexible cage to contain the primate subject and the other is the presentation board which houses the stimulus tray. The stimulus tray contains several food wells which can be covered with three- dimensional objects such as stars, squares, pyramids, or circles, with differing sizes and colors. There is a one way screen separating the two compartments which allows the researcher to control whether the subject can see them place the stimulus objects and food rewards in the stimulus tray or not. On the outside of the stimulus compartment, opposite the cage, there is a second one way screen which allows the researcher to observe the subject at each stage of the trial without interfering with the subject‚Äôs behavior. Both compartments are completely enclosed to ensure the safety of both the subject and the researcher. There are several other components that make up a standard WGTA which have remained constant throughout the numerous modifications made to the device over time. One of these elements is a food reward such as a raisin, peanut, grape, or apple bit. Underneath a variable number of stimulus objects, usually 1-3, there will be a reward for the subject to access once they properly move the object. The WGTA also provides the option for an interval of observation in which the monkey can see but not yet move any of the stimulus objects. The researcher is able to observe the primate‚Äôs behavior during this interval through a one way screen. There is also another interval during which the divider is removed and the monkey can access the objects and obtain the food reward. For this period of time, the primate is allowed to manipulate the objects in an attempt to obtain the reward, during which time the observer is able to collect additional observational data on the primate‚Äôs behavior. Uses The Wisconsin General Test Apparatus is used to test the learning capabilities of monkeys. The subject, usually a primate, is contained in the half of the apparatus that functions as a cage. Here the primate and observer are able to be kept safe during different intervals of observation. Numerous tests including black-white discrimination and reversal tests and two-choice object discrimination tests have utilized the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus. The device has also been modified for other uses. These include but are not limited to modifications for: use with rats, use with smaller primates, a semi-automatic function, and for improved portability.

It occurs in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Taxonomy The fungus was described as new to science to Canadian mycologist Kenneth A. Harrison in 1964. The type was collected by Alexander H. Smith in Crescent City, California, on November 1937. It is kept at University of Michigan Herbarium. Harrison considered this species‚Äîin addition to H. cruentum and H. scleropodium‚Äîto be members of the stirps (species thought to be descendants of a common ancestor) he called \\"cruentum\\". This stirps is characterized by the presence of red juice drops on young fruit bodies, bluish spines, and similar spore morphology. Description The fruit bodies have irregularly shaped caps measuring in diameter. The cap surface is rough with small hard points, has ridges, and is a dark blue-wine red color that changes later to lavender. The outer cap edge turns whitish with age. Young fruit bodies are covered with drops of red juice. The flesh has a woody or cork-like texture, and a strong, \\"disagreeable\\" odor and taste. The spines on the underside of the caps are up to 3 mm long with a color ranging from initially grayish violet blue to wine- blue with brownish tints, to dull grayish-green. The stipe measures long by thick, and tends to root into the ground. Its color is deep bluish-black (with similarly colored flesh within) with a whitish mycelium at the base. Staining the spines or the cap or stipe flesh with potassium hydroxide turns it blue- green. Spores are angular, cross-shaped with four to six thick points, and measure 4‚Äì5 by 3.5‚Äì4.5 ¬µm. The spore shape has been likened to jacks. =Similar species= The lookalike species Hydnellum caeruleum can be readily distinguished from H. cyanopodium by its lack of a medicinal odor, the absence of red juice drops, and the orange to rusty-brown color of its stipe. H. caeruleum can be further distinguished microscopically by its roughly spherical spores. H. scleropodium has a smoother texture and more pallid colors. H. cruentum, found in Nova Scotia, Canada, has an odor that has been described as \\"medicinal\\". Habitat and distribution Hydnellum cyanopodium fruits singly, in groups, or with fruit bodies fused together. It occurs under Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and pine (Pinus spp.) in California. The fungus is also found in Oregon.

It first premiered on September 26, 1831 at the Park Theatre in New York City. Background This theatrical piece was written at the request of Edwin Forrest, an American actor seeking to further his career. He wanted to solidify his fame by acquiring the rights to perform in plays customized to highlight his talents and physical attributes so he devised a contest to encouraged dramaturgs to author new works in return for a cash price. Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags, a play by John Augustus Stone won Forrest's inaugural play prize in 1829. A huge success, Metamora inspired Forrest to continue offering the prize. Robert Montgomery Bird, a doctor without \\"an all-consuming passion for medicine,\\" hearing of the prize, penned and submitted his first play, the blank verse tragedy Pelopidas, or The Fall of the Polemarchs. Although Pelopidas won the prize, it was not produced or published until 1919, possibly because Pelopidas does not dominate the action of his play in the way Metamora managed and therefore failed to show off Forrest's abilities adequately. However, Forrest found it well written and encouraged a second submission by Bird. The following year, Bird won Forrest's prize a second time with that play that would become his most impactful, The Gladiator. Bird's brother Henry, in a letter advised Robert to continue with The Gladiator as Spartacus was \\"altogether more suited to Forrest's Roman figure & actions.\\" In fact, it turned out to be the perfect vehicle to showcase Forrest‚Äôs ‚Äúmuscular acting style‚Äù . Thanks to The Gladiator, Forrest became ‚Äúthe most famous American actor of his day‚Äù.

Spartacus is a gladiator who initially refuses to fight because he will not ‚Äúslay a man for the diversion of Romans‚Äù. The play opens with Phasarius, a Thracian slave and other gladiators decrying the position of Rome and considering a revolt against the state left vulnerable by its colonizing and war-mongering generals. However, upon heading from his lanista, Bracchius, that a newly captured Thracian gladiator is an even better fighter than himself, Phasarius resolves to postpone his plans for coup. This newly captured slave is Spartacus, who agrees to battle so that he may free his also captured wife and child. He barters his services, ‚ÄúI will serve you Better than slave e'er served‚Äù, in exchange for his family, ‚ÄúKeep us together‚Äù. Upon meeting each other in the arena of the amphitheater, however, Phasarius and Spartacus recognize each other as brothers, refuse to fight and incite their fellow gladiators to revolt. They proclaim, ‚ÄúDeath to the Roman fiends, that make their mirth Out of the groans of bleeding misery! Ho, slaves, arise! it is your hour to kill! Kill and spare not -For wrath and liberty!-‚Äù War ensues. The gladiator army, led by Spartacus is initially successful in their crusade against the Romans. However, the two brothers have differing agendas: while Spartacus wants to return with his wife, Senona and son to his beloved Thrace and his live as a shepherd, Phasarius wants to sack Rome. He declares, ‚ÄúWhilst this city stands, This ne'er can be; for just so long our country Remains a Roman province. Tear it down, And you enfranchise Thrace, and half the world\\". Phasarius eventually defects from his brother's army when Spartacus forbids his advance on Julia, the captured niece of Crassus, a Roman praetor. Splintered, the various rebelling armies are easily defeated by the Romans. Phasarius, reconciled and reunited with his brother's dwindling campaign, attempts to escort Senona and her son through a forest to safety. In this attempt, Senona and her child are slain by waiting Roman troops, while Phasarius manages to stumble back to Spartacus and deliver the tragic news before he too dies. Enraged, Spartacus refuses a pardon granted to him by the Romans. In his final bloody fight, Spartacus manages to kill his former captor, Lentulus, before he is felled by multiple Roman troops over the cries of Julia's protest. Though it does not have happy ending, The Gladiator conveys the huge sacrifice man has been willing to withstand throughout history for the sake of freedom. Production history Forrest as Spartacus The Gladiator premiered at New York's Park Theatre on September 26, 1831. Although the weather on opening night was poor, the actors in secondary roles of questionable distinction and the sets and costumes \\"wretchedly bad,\\" the play was a massive success and was received with increasing enthusiasm each of the four nights it played. This original production was noted for the play's climatic Act Two in which Spartacus and Pharsarius refuse to slaughter each other. This scene was staged in a spectacular way, the likes of which had not yet been seen that century. After such success in New York, the production moved to Philadelphia, where it was first produced on October 24 and Boston, where the play was seen in November. The Gladiator was such a success for Forrest that he opened with it when he traveled to London in 1836. Although Forrest was a success at the Drury Lane Theatre on October 17 with The Gladiator, the audience demonstrated their desire to see Shakespeare as The Gladiator was seen by many in the audience as anti-British. Although The Gladiator remained a central part of Forrest's repertoire, as with many pre- Civil War plays, it eventually fell out of favor as naturalism and \\"realistic representation\\" became more popular. Even though Bird‚Äôs work helped secure Forrest prominence, their partnership ended when Forrest failed to compensate Bird as they had originally agreed. In fact, Forrest‚Äôs ‚Äúpoor treatment led Bird to become a novelist‚Äù. Notwithstanding the dissolution of their partnership, Forrest produced and starred in The Gladiator over 1000 times. Slavery in The Gladiator The social relevance of The Gladiator is unquestionable. Spartacus is the ‚Äúunderdog who through thirst for individual freedom and love of family risks all in taking on a tyrannical government‚Äù. Certainly, 19th century American theater patrons could identify to this as the young country was still figuring out how to live up to the ‚Äúpromises of the Revolution‚Äù. But the impact reached far beyond the confines of mainstream American theater goers. Dealing with slave insurgency in Ancient Rome, The Gladiator implicitly attacks the institution of Slavery in the United States by ‚Äútransforming the Antebellum into neoclassical rebels‚Äù. Spartacus was born free just like the first generation of slaves in America and he valued that freedom above anything but family. Unquestionably, the play deals with many of the issues faced by the African slaves of the time including the inevitable shattering of family units resulting from individual slave sales. Spartacus‚Äô yearning for his wife and son mirrored the plight of many slaves with family members scattered across multiple households or plantations. Although Spartacus finds himself ‚Äúremoved from anything like liberty and dignity‚Äù, he manages to rise from the ‚Äúlowest of the low to become an inspiring role model who comes close to achieving freedom for himself and others‚Äù. Robert Montgomery Bird Bird's opinion on Slavery in the United States is often questioned in regards to The Gladiator. The play was written in a time of great abolitionist activity: William Lloyd Garrison founded The Liberator, an influential anti-slavery newspaper, the same year as Bird wrote his play. Thus the timing of the first performance of The Gladiator was impeccable with it coinciding with the inception of The Liberator. It almost seemed to predict the slave uprising led by Nat Turner in Virginia which resulted in the deaths of many whites until Turner and his men were captured and executed. In his appraisal of the work, Whitman insists that, \\"this play is as full of 'Abolitionism' as an egg is of meat.\\" He called The Gladiator a calculated play to ‚Äúmake the heart of the masses well responsive to all those noble aspirations on behalf of mortal freedom‚Äù. Clearly, Whitman had no doubt of the play‚Äôs abolitionist undertones. Jenna Gibbs states that Bird ‚Äúused the story to denounce black slavery‚Äù and adds that, ‚ÄúBird noted that his intention was an impassionate and strong dialogue about slavery‚Äù. Richards was also convinced of Bird‚Äôs anti-slavery agenda stating, ‚ÄúThe Gladiator seems intent in reminding audiences that it enacts a slave revolt‚Äù. Yet later scholars have dissented from Whitman's surety. Though some still debate that it is not clear that he intentionally conceived The Gladiator as an abolitionist play, everyone agrees that he was fully aware of its incendiary potential in the South. Certainly, Bird did not want his play to be \\"damned\\" in the south. And while Bird himself was worried that, The Gladiator produced in a Slave state would lead to, \\"the managers, players, and perhaps myself ... rewarded with the Penitentiary,\\" he also differentiated between \\"nobel\\" Thracian rebels and \\"violent\\" African American slaves. Writing in his journal of the Nat Turner slave rebellion, Bird remarks, \\"if they had had a Spartacus among them to organize the half million of Virginia, the hundreds of thousands of the [other] states, and lead them on in the Crusade of Massacre, what a blessed example might they not give the world of the excellence of slavery.\\" Regardless of Bird‚Äôs intention, the truth is that the play‚Äôs setting could be easily changed from Rome to a Southern plantation without need to modify much else. Criticism From the very first performance in New York City the play was a major success, both commercially and critically. Mr. Forrest‚Äôs Spartacus was deemed ‚Äúthe perfection of the art histrionic‚Äù and ‚Äúone of the gems that shone upon the stage‚Äù. Amongst other praise accorded The Gladiator, it was called \\"the best native tragedy extant,\\" \\"decidedly the best drama ever written in this century\\" with \\"the stamp of genius in every lineament.\\" The prominent Philadelphia critic, Wemyss called the play, upon its opening in that city, \\"the perfection of melodramatic tragedy.\\" The play was indeed a huge success in Philadelphia as well as Boston and other cities in the Northeastern United States. Writing in The Brooklyn Eagle in late 1846, Walt Whitman also discusses Forrest's talent, citing the actor as \\"a deserved favorite with the public.\\" While the relationship between The Gladiator and its playwright to slavery is much debated (see above), the play is often seen as the pinnacle of romanticism in American drama. Written only a few years following the inauguration of Andrew Jackson, the play is Anti-imperial and anti-British where distant colonies are persecuted while ancient lineages reign dominant over \\"the new blood of the poor,\\" a common theme in Jacksonian political rhetoric. The Gladiator played successfully across the country for 70 years. A marker of its enormous success may be seen in how many performances were produced: by 1854, The Gladiator had been performed over 1000 times, a remarkable feat. It was considered to be the first time a play had reached such a threshold in the playwright's lifetime. Forrest retained the play in his repertoire until his death, and it was eventually taken up by John Edward McCullough and Robert Downing. Legacy The Gladiator‚Äôs legacy was a success from its very first performance. Its theatrical acclaim can be attributed to the appeal of its star, Edwin Forrest, in conjunction with the story of the oppressed seeking freedom from despotism. The story not only capitalized on the success of the American Revolution but it fed from the cultural and societal mood of the time. By subtly tying the story of Roman slavery to that of African American slaves, Bird created a framework through which he could express his human equality views. As a result, The Gladiator became a cornerstone of American dramaturgy awarding Bird his righteous place as one of the most acclaimed playwrights of the early 19th century. Having been performed over 1000 times, The Gladiator‚Äôs longevity attests to the universality of its central story touching on themes ranging from freedom and family to the sacrifice sometimes required to achieve societal rather than individual goals. Not only is the story of The Gladiator a universally appealing tale, but Forrest‚Äôs foresight in having such a play custom fitted to his ability is also an important aspect of the legacy of this work. In fact, The Gladiator‚Äôs \\"Spartacus was perfectly conceived to meet the actor‚Äôs strengths\\" and completely suited to \\"Forrest‚Äôs Roman figure and actions\\". Spartacus is \\"loud, dynamic, and anti-aristocratic\\" which perfectly suited Forrest‚Äôs image. With Forrest talents and physical abilities determining the course of the play, it is one of the first instances where a particular actor‚Äôs skills and physique dictate the tone and content of a theatrical offering. Today, theatrical vehicles are often created to fit the needs and desires of many superstars and even up- and comers who are believed to be worth the time and financial investment. Published during the \\"Golden Era of the American Stage\\", The Gladiator stands as one of the first epics written by an American author. As a theatrical piece, its impact in the American entertainment industry is irrefutable. Bird‚Äôs play, with its critical and financial success, demonstrated the potential of ancient history as fodder for entertainment. It can be considered a precursor to the many works inspired or set during the Roman Empire that are found in contemporary literature and portrayed in the theatre, television shows, and feature films. For example, Broadway's Her First Roman and Pippin are based on Roman Empire characters though gladiators are not central to the stories. Gladiators do abound in television and film. Spartacus‚Äô story has been told by at least one long running television series and a 2004 made for TV movie starring Goran Visnjic. On the big screen, Howard Fast‚Äôs novel Spartacus was adapted into film in 1960 starring Kirk Douglas and it is considered a classic. Just like Bird‚Äôs play, Fast‚Äôs novel has social relevance in that it reflects the fight for the ‚Äúpolitical empowerment of the working class‚Äù (Joshel et. al. 91). Perhaps the most successful Roman Empire movie is the 2000 film Gladiator starring Russell Crowe. Though not directly based on Bird‚Äôs work, the influence of The Gladiator is evident throughout Crowe‚Äôs film. Although the story is different, the heroic central figure, Maximus, is uncannily similar to Spartacus including the yearning for family, his failed attempt at escaping Roman rule, and his untimely sacrificial death. It is important to note that, just like Forrest, the actors in both of the films mentioned had input regarding the content of the films and used them as career building vehicles.

Scenery in theater at the time closely mirrored these changes and with the onslaught of the Industrial Revolution and technological advancement throughout the century, dramatically changed the aesthetics of the theater. Realism Theatrical realism was a general movement in 19th-century theatre from the time period of 1870-1960 that developed a set of dramatic and theatrical conventions with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances. Part of a broader artistic movement, it included a focus on everyday middle-class drama, ordinary speech, and simple settings. This idea of representing subject matter truthfully, was evident in the changes that were made to scenic design in theater. Theatrical designers and directors began meticulously researching historical accuracy for their productions, which meant that scenery could no longer be drawn from stock - which was typically used over and over again in generic settings for different shows. Scenery began to be custom designed and made for specific production. This meant, while scenery used to be seen as capital investment, it was not considered to be more disposable when the production was removed from the repertory. Scenic Innovation One of the most important scenic transition into the century was from the often-used two dimensional scenic backdrop to three dimensional sets. Previously, as a two dimensional environment, scenery did not provide an embracing, physical environment for the dramatic action happening on stage. This changed when three dimensional sets were introduced in the first half of the century. This, coupled with change in audience and stage dynamic as well as advancement in theater architecture that allowed for hidden scene changes, the theater became more representational instead of presentational, and invited audience to be transported to a conceived ‚Äòother‚Äô world. =Box Set= The epitome of the new three dimensional style sets and one of the most important advancement of scenic design was the popularization of the box set. The box set has been around since the 17th century but lacked support. Madame Vestris had introduced realistic stage furnishing in 1836 at her little Olympic Theatre in London, and forced them on American managers when she toured this country in 1838-1839.Taubman, Howard. The making of American theatre. New York: Coward McCann Inc., 196, pg 140 The box set was a gradual replacement of the painted wing-and-shutter sets. Between 1800 and 1875, many theater artists began to use them. A box set consists of flats hinged together to represent a room; it often has practicable elements, such as doors and windows, which can be used during the course of a play or show.Martin, Ben. THEATER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. . With the new pursuit of realism, room-like box settings now had heavy molding, real doors with doorknobs, and ample accurate furniture. Having the box set also meant that many theater artists began to stage all the action behind the proscenium in the late 1800s, thus reinforcing the illusion of a fourth wall. Audiences would be watching a ‚Äúslice of life‚Äù through a window. Box sets allowed scenic designers to create better visualized atmospheres and moods. Aesthetic Style 19th century scenic styles in America were unique derivations from the European masters. Scenic artists from Europe brought with them the Romantic, Baroque, or classical landscapes that they knew from their homes, but the styles seemed to change when they landed on the American shore.Beuder, Susan Crabtree & Peter. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Ed. Taylor & Francis. Illustrated. 2005. The romantic English landscape painting style slowly adapted to the American image. The more rugged wild- western American landscape came to be idealized by native scenic artists throughout the century. Many theatres invested in generic scenery meant for virtually any production. An all-purpose set included landscapes, European cities, prison, palace, village, mountain pass, and forest.Beuder, Susan Crabtree & Peter. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Ed. Taylor & Francis. Illustrated. 2005, pg 415 The oleo was a versatile drop for any sort of entertainment. The oleo drop often hung in the in-one position, subdividing the stage into a shallower depth that was more appropriate for a brief interlude.Beuder, Susan Crabtree & Peter. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Ed. Taylor & Francis. Illustrated. 2005, pg 415 The act curtain or drop curtain functioned as today's main drape, the decorative divider wall between audience and stage. Often, it was the most elaborate piece a theater owned and was painted to harmonize with the interior decorations of the theater itself. Technological Advancement During the nineteenth century, the technology of the industrial revolution was applied to theater. Many historians believe that the popularity of melodrama, with its emphasis on stage spectacle and special effects, accelerated these technological innovations: For example, Dion Boucicault was responsible for the introduction of fireproofing in the theater when one of his melodramatic plays called for an onstage fire.Martin, Ben. THEATER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. =Panorama= While the invention of the panorama is attributed to Scotsman Robert Barker in 1787, Frenchman Louis Jacques Daguerre (1789 to 1851) is largely seen as having perfected the invention in the 19th century. He created the diorama which was a still painting viewed by an audience sitting on a rotating platform. This soon gave way to the moving panorama in which a setting was painted on a long cloth, which could be unrolled across the stage by turning spools, created an illusion of movement and changing locales. A popular American play, William Dunlap's A Trip to Niagara (1828), used this device to show a voyage from New York City to Niagara Falls via a steamboat.Martin, Ben. THEATER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. . The advent of the panoramas coupled with Charles Kean‚Äôs invention of the Corsican trap meant that entire horse and chariots races could be enacted on stage. The emphasis on recreating natural environments onstage was probably influenced by romanticism, which called for a \\"return to nature.\\" THE MOVABLE STAGE AT MADISON SQUARE THEATER, NEW YORK =Elevator Stage= On February 7, 1880, The Spirit of the Times announced: ‚ÄòTonight Mr. J. Steele MacKaye will open the most exquisite theatre in the world, and all New York will assemble to do honor to the realization of his artistic visions‚Ä¶Mr. MacKaye will play the drama Hazel Kirke through with only two-minute waits between the acts, and will then exhibit the double stage‚Äîone compartment set for the kitchen of Blackburn Mill and other as boudoir at Fairy Grove Villa. MacKaye's elevator stage was an important development of American drama and theatre. It was a solution to the problem posed by the increasing use of box sets to reproduce interior scenes in detail. With the elevator stage, multiple scenes could be changed in a fast and detailed way. This greatly improved the speed and efficiency of scenic changes, and that design didn‚Äôt have to be simplified, they could still be detailed. The elevator stage was described in the Scientific American, April 5, 1884. [It consists] of two theatrical stages, one above another, to be moved up and down as an elevator car is operated in a high building, and so that either one of them can easily and quickly be at any time brought to the proper level for acting thereon in front of the auditorium. While the play is proceeding before the audience, the assistants arrange another scene on the upper stageFrench, Glenn Hughes & Samuel. A history of the American theatre. Binghamton: Vail Ballot Press Inc., 1951, pg.234-236 =Edwin Booth Theatre= New styles of scenery meant that new means of scene shifting were needed. The Edwin Booth Theatre, opened in 1869, was the first in a new generation of theaters built specifically to suit three dimensional set pieces. It was the first theater to have a level stage floor (rather than a raked floor, as had been the standard in proscenium-arch theaters since the Renaissance) and no grooves in the stage floor for shifting flats. This idea would become the standard by the end of the century. Elevators and equipment for flying scenery also complemented the space. =Stage Lighting= Nineteenth-century technology revolutionized stage lighting, which until then had been primitive. The introduction of gas lighting was the first step. In 1816, Philadelphia's Chestnut Street Theater became the earliest gas-lit playhouse in the world.Hewitt, Barnard. Theatre U.S.A. 1655-1957. University of Illinois: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1959, pg 105 The introduction of gas lighting revolutionized stage lighting. It provided a somewhat more natural and adequate light for the playing and the scenic space upstage of the proscenium arch. However, this new richness in lighting provided difficulties at first. Though scenic painters had to learn to subdue their colors to the increased candle-power, the brightness only further highlight the disparity between three dimensional set pieces and their two dimensional backdrop and led to the latter's eventual decline. The advent of limelight, also known as Drummond light, also effectively introduced spotlighting to theater. Thomas Edison's electric incandescent lamp, invented in 1879, was the next step. It made electricity the most flexible, most controllable, and safest form of lighting, in the twentieth century, it would make stage lighting design a true art. These new means of illumination tremendously increased the control over stage light and stimulated interest in imitating lighting phenomena of natureHewitt, Barnard. Theatre U.S.A. 1655-1957. University of Illinois: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1959, pg 105. Noted Designers, Artists, and Technologists It was during this time that scenic artist began to be recognized for their work. Many of the scenic artists operated their own scenic studios in New York and towards the latter half of the century, the first theatrical unions were formed as a response to the Theatre Syndicate. Producing who originally hired staff carpenters and company painters began to place their productions out to bid. It was also during this time period that designers began working with models to convey their design. *Steele MacKaye (1842-1894) was one innovative theater technologist that invented the elevator stage. In 1880, at the Madison Square Theater in New York, Mackaye used two stages; one above the other, which could be raised and lowered; while one stage was in view of the audience, the scenery on the other, which was either in the basement or in the fly area, could be changedHewitt, Barnard. Theatre U.S.A. 1655-1957. University of Illinois: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1959. *David Belasco (1853-1931) was an American producer, director and playwright, Mr. Belasco is primarily remembered today for his emphasis on naturalistic detail. David Belasco is best known for his ultra-realistic melodramas of the turn of the century. He and his chief scenic artist, George Gros, created meticulously detailed interiors, realistic exteriors, and stunning atmospheric effects.Beuder, Susan Crabtree & Peter. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Ed. Taylor & Francis. Illustrated. 2005, pg.415 Belasco and Gros produced some of the most memorable scenic inventions of the American theatre and certainly some of the finest realistic scenery of the theatre history. His laborious scenic and lighting techniques were seen by the avant-garde as the embodiment of every ill of the stage and were severely ridiculed by history. In 1909, for a production of The Easiest Way, his scenic artist placed the contents of a boarding house room, including the wallpaper, on the stage of the Stuyvesant Theatre and three years later (1912) he built on stage a fully functioning restaurant for the Governor's Lady.Wild, Larry. A Brief History of Theatrical Scenery. 18 February 2002. 23 February 2006 . Alfred Roller, Before a Palace, for Goethe's Faust, Part II, Act V, Scene 17, 1911, Pen and black ink, watercolor and gouache, on paper *Alfred Roller (1864-1935) was trained as a painter in Vienna, but his designs hinted at a new concept of scenic design.Sumner, Edwin Mims Jr. & Oral. The Pageant of America- the American stage. Yale university press, 1929, pg 338 Focused entirely on the interplay of light and color to create evocative stage spaces. Roller's designs relied on a selected or simplified realism in which only few items were introduced to the stage, but each of them evocative, detailed and powerful. He utilized mobile scenic towers that could be rearranged and altered with light to form new shapes and movement patterns on the stage (Sumner 338). He was probably the earliest designer to embody and practice the ideas of Adolph Appia and Edward Gordon Craig. *Charles Witham (1842-1926) was born in Portland, Maine and educated as an artist. He spent some time as an itinerant landscapist before becoming involved with the theater. Thanks to the friendship of Gaspard Maeder, Witham obtained his first theatre job as Maeder's assistant when the latter was chief designer for Niblo's Garden in New York in the early 1860s. By 1863, Witham had become head designer for the Boston Theater where he painted scenery for Edwin Forrest. His stay in Boston was short because he was hired by Edwin Booth to join his staff as scenic artist. He would go on to be Booth's primary designer for years to come. His collection of work remains the largest surviving theater scenic art from the time period Notable Plays Scene from Daly's Under the Gaslight (1868) *Under the Gaslight (1868), was one of the first of many plays to use a steam engine onstage while the hero was being tied to the railway tracks. ‚ÄúDespite the fact that, on the first night, the machinery of the great railroad scene failed to work properly, the audience was held in tense excitement, and the play from the outset was a success‚Äù It ran for 110 performances.French, Glenn Hughes & Samuel. A history of the American theatre. Binghamton: Vail Ballot Press Inc., 1951, pg 198. The mechanical effects involved are said to have been patented by Augustin Daly. Poster of musical theatre The Black Crook, representing the finale in which the amazons crush the forces of evil. *There were many thrills in The Black Crook (1866), but the greatest of them was the corps de ballet and the hundred of costumes. After the premier, which lasted from 7:45pm till 1:15am, the Tribune reported that ‚ÄúThe Scenery is magnificent; the ballet is beautiful; the drama is‚Äîrubbish‚Ä¶the last scene in the play, however, will dazzle and impress to even a greater degree, by its lavish richness and barbaric splendor. All that gold and silver, and gems and light, and woman‚Äôs beauty can contribute to fascinate the eye and charm the sense.French, Glenn Hughes & Samuel. A history of the American theatre. Binghamton: Vail Ballot Press Inc., 1951, pg 199 The best exhibited scenery piece is the one that closes the second act. A vast grotto extending into an almost measureless perspective. Stalactites descend from the arched roof. A tranquil and lovely lake reflects the golden glories that span it like a vast sky. In every direction one sees the bright sheen or the dull richness of massy gold. Beautiful fairies and sprites make the scene luxuriant.Hewitt, Barnard. Theatre U.S.A. 1655-1957. University of Illinois: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1959, pg 196. *The Poor of New York (1899), scenically displaying such contrasts and spectacles as a rich home in Madison Square, a tenement house in Cross Street, with a fire, a bank in Nassau Street, and a snow storm in Union SquareFrench, Glenn Hughes & Samuel. A history of the American theatre. Binghamton: Vail Ballot Press Inc., 1951, pg 187, Aftermath The end of the 19th century witnessed both the height and the end of scenery painted in traditional perspective. Scenic design was realistic and creative that released the audience‚Äôs imagination. Realism was but a passing style. Towards the end of the century, realism would find an opposite in naturalism. Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig would be the ones to revolt against the idea of the actor standing on a flat floor surrounded by ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù painted canvases. Their controversial ideas would be the basis of the New Stagecraft. The 20th century would bring the scenic designer an entirely new aesthetic for the world of the theatre in the form of Henrik Ibsen and Modernism. As movies replaced theatre's popularity, an international aesthetic weighed in against painted scenery, scenic studios began to shrink, and scenic artists began to disappear. The golden age of scenic painting of the 19th century rapidly turned to a much more fragmented one in 20th century, as theatre styles changed radically and eventually the theatre lost popularity to movies and television.

Production monitoring and control of larger operations is often run from a central space, called a control room or operations room or operations control center (OCC). The emerging area of Project Production Management (PPM), based on viewing project activities as a production system, adopts the same notion of production control to take steps to regulate the behavior of a production system where in this case the production system is a capital project, rather than a physical facility or a physically dispersed service.

Personal life Diver was born Katherine Helen Maud Marshall in Murree, now in Pakistan, where her father Charles Henry Tilson Marshall served as an officer in the British Indian Army. She grew up in India and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), but received her education in England. She had a lifelong friendship with the sister of Rudyard Kipling, Trix Fleming. Diver married Thomas Diver (1860‚Äì1941), an officer in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, . They settled in England and had a son, Cyril (1892‚Äì1962). Writing Maud Diver published her first novel, Captain Desmond, VC, in 1907. This and several subsequent books were successful and charted on the bestseller lists of the time. She specialised in the imperial romance genre which was popular at the time. However, unlike her contemporary, Kipling, Diver has been forgotten by later generations. There has been recent interest in her books as a source of information for studies on Anglo-Indian culture. Her novels tried to instruct Englishmen on how they were to live in British India and included depictions of mixed marriages (for example in Lilamani and its sequels) between Indians and the English as a positive means of bringing East and West together. She countered Kipling's aphorism of \\"East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet\\" with, At the same time, she also held the view that the British bloodline should not be diluted too much (as in the book, Desmond's Daughter).

He was a principal proponent of Mail art. His efforts were concentrated in the areas of self-documentation and performance, often employing subterfuge and a wry sense of humor. He was a founding member (with Robert J. Lambert) of the conceptual rock band Les Petites Bon-Bons.  Early work and activism  Active in the local civil rights and anti-war movements in the late 1960s, Dreva was devoted to the cause of gay rights on the local and national level. He was a founding member (together with Robert J. Lambert) of Les Petites Bon-Bons, a flamboyantly attired musical group that never played a single concert. In fact, they never so much as picked up an instrument. Instead they dressed as glitter rock musicians of the era (1970‚Äôs) and were frequently featured in newspapers and magazines as Les Petite Bon Bons. In one of his most famous performances he would sneak out at night and spray paint public buildings in South Milwaukee. The next morning, in his role as a reporter for the local South Milwaukee weekly, the Voice-Journal, he would report glowingly on these graffiti events sometimes signed by the ‚ÄúArt Gangster‚Äù thus creating a countercultural figure and simultaneously influencing the way in which that figure was portrayed in the media. It was a ruse that lasted several years. As a mail artist he corresponded with individuals well known for their work in this field including On Kawara, Ray Johnson, Ben Vautier, Coum Transmissions, General Idea and members of Asco. His work was included in countless mail art exhibits both nationally and internationally, including Extended Sensibilities: Homosexual Presence in Contemporary Art at the New Museum in New York in 1982. During the 1980s Dreva became increasingly interested in Latin America, learning Spanish and spending considerable time in Guatemala, El Salvador and other Central and South American countries, where he studied revolutionary movements. He was a supporter of the Shining Path in Peru, but adamant in insisting that gay rights be included in their agenda.

History John Fry Rockhey bought a small drapery business on Fleet Street, Torquay from a Mr Peter Thomas in 1881, and set about expanding the business with his partner Mr T S Bulleid. The store grew from the original one to four over the next few years and by 1901 the business was incorporated. John Fry Rockhey was Mayor of Torquay 1896-97 and 1901‚Äì02 and was made a Freeman of the City. Upon the death of J F Rockhey (date unknown), his business partner T M Bulleid took over as Chairman of the board until his death in 1937, when J F Bulleid took over the reins. He was behind a remodelling of the store which took place between 1939-40. A further store was opened in Newton Abbot. In 1948, D H Evans purchased the business for ¬£259,556 but continued to operate the business as a separate entity from the Oxford Street store. In 1954, however, Harrods completed the purchase of the entire preference share capital of DH Evans (they had owned the entire ordinary share capital since 1928). House of Fraser purchased the Harrods group in 1959.

Described as new to science in 1976, it is found in the southeastern United States. The mushroom is frequently confused with Marasmius siccus, and microscopy is needed to reliably distinguish between them. Taxonomy The fungus was described as new to science in 1976 by mycologist Martina S. Gilliam. It has been classified in the section Sicci of the genus Marasmius, along with species like M. delectans, M. megistus, M. anomalus, and M. haematocephalus. However, molecular analysis has not provided evidence that these species form a distinct phylogenetically related group. Description The gills are yellowish-white and distantly spaced. The cap is initially cushion shaped or bell shaped before becoming convex, and it has a small umbo; it reaches a diameter of . The cap surface is dry, somewhat velvety in texture, and has radial furrows extending to the edge of the cap as well as a pleated margin. The color ranges from tawny brown to rusty brown. The thin yellowish-white gills are up to broad, free from attachment to the stipe, and distantly spaced‚Äîthere are typically 23‚Äì28 gills present. The stipe measures long by 1‚Äì1.25 mm thick, and is straight or curved, shiny, and hollow. It is dark brown except for a pink region near the top, and it has a tuft of cotton- like white mycelium at the base. The odor and taste of the mushroom are weakly farinaceous (similar to freshly-ground flour). The edibility of the fruit bodies has not been determined. Marasmius fulvoferrugineus has a white spore print. The spores are shaped like lances (oblanceolate) or curved clubs, and are smooth, hyaline (translucent), and have dimensions of 15.2‚Äì18 by 3‚Äì4.5 ¬µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 35‚Äì38 by 8‚Äì12 ¬µm. =Similar species= Other Marasmius species readily confused with M. fulvoferrugineus include M. siccus and M. pulcherripes.

He was responsible for much of the work on railways in the North and Midlands of England, particularly the Whitby and Pickering Railway and the North Midland Railway. Early life He was born on 1 October 1810 in Chester to Joseph Swanwick and Hannah nee Wicksteed, one of a large family. He was first educated at a school run by his maiden aunts, Mary and Martha Wicksteed, followed by tutelage of the Rev. William Bakewell, the Unitarian minister at Chester. At the age of around twelve he went to live with the Rev. Dr. Hutton in Leeds, since though his elder brothers had been sent to a public school, his large family was proving expensive to educate. In common with such schools of the time, the curriculum of the school seems to have consisted of Latin, Greek, French, and some elementary mathematics. It did not include science or engineering as unbefitting for one of his class. In 1826, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled at the University of Edinburgh. He discarded his classical studies in favour of mathematics, natural philosophy and geology. Returning home in 1827, he continued his study of mathematics. He had a strong interest in civil engineering, following the work of a cousin on his mother‚Äôs side, Thomas Wicksteed, engineer of the East London Waterworks Company. It was at this time that the Grosvenor Bridge was being built at Chester across the River Dee. Frederick‚Äôs father knew the contractor James Trubshaw personally and obtained permission for Frederick to assist with the work. Following this, an uncle introduced him to George Stephenson. Career Aged nineteen, he was indentured to George Stephenson for \\"four years and eight months from 5 October 1829 in the occupation or business of a civil engineer,\\" and went to live with him at his home with the other apprentices. Within a year he was made private secretary, succeeding Daniel Gooch and continued in that position until Stephenson moved to Ashby-de-la-Zouch. He assisted Stephenson in building the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and drove one of the engines, ‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù which drew the first passenger train. This was followed by the construction of the Leicester and Swannington Railway in 1832. Following this, Stephenson delegated to him the entire work of building the horse-drawn Whitby and Pickering Railway, which opened on 26 May 1836. In 1835, George Stephenson received the commission to build the North Midland Railway from Derby to Leeds. He and Swanwick travelled the route on the 5th and 6 August, and the latter carried out further inspections with his assistants, meeting George Stephenson at Sheffield to discuss their future plans. Concurrently with this he was working on the York and North Midland Railway and the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway. Confidence in his capability was such that in 1836 he was present at the House of Lords to give evidence to the Committee about these three lines, as well as on the proposed Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway. The accuracy of his presentations at a time when the slightest error could cause rejection of a bill justified the confidence Stephenson placed on him. The Act for the North Midland Railway was obtained in 1836, and Frederick Swanwick became acting engineer. Again, Stephenson, who was wishing to concentrate in exploiting the coal in Leicestershire and in Clay Cross, delegated to him the responsibility for almost the entire work involved in its construction. This entailed laying out of the line, preparing the plans and specifications of all the work, and organising and superintending much of the work The construction of the 72 mile line took four years to accomplish, practically its whole length being on embankments and viaducts or through cuttings and tunnels. The line was opened in 1840. He continued as resident engineer of the North Midland Railway until 1844, and played a leading role in the formation of Midland Railway taking the various bills through Parliament, and then supervising the work on new lines and reconstruction of existing ones, among them the Nottingham and Mansfield, Nottingham and Lincoln, the Erewash Valley Line and the Mansfield and Pinxton. Personal life Though tremendously busy, he set great store by his family life. In 1836 he lived at Norton Lees on the outskirts of Sheffield but in 1837 he moved to Whittington, and invited his father, mother and sister to join him, with his maiden aunts, the Misses Wicksteed, to live nearby. On 21 July 1840 he married Elizabeth Drayton, fourth child of Mr. William Drayton, of Leicester, with whom he had a son and a daughter. From about 1850 he began to prepare for retirement and took on no new professional work. He had for some time been a supporter of benevolent schemes such as the Mechanics' Institute, various schools in Chesterfield and Whittington, and the Chesterfield and North Derbyshire Hospital. The extended leisure allowed him to give them more attention. In 1857 he intervened in a dispute between the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway Company, in which he had shares, and the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway Company. Though many of the others had sold their shares in disgust, he secured an agreement between the two companies. In 1869 he became a Justice of the Peace for the county of Derby and was active in the Liberal Party, resisting invitations to stand for Parliament. He took an increasing interest in education, visiting schools around the country to study them. Whittington was expanding rapidly with industry and had become three separate villages: Old Whittington, New Whittington and Whittington Moor. Swanwick gave generously of his time and money to provide education for the increasing population, in time building up to a school in each of the three villages. In the autumn of 1884, signs of failing health began to show themselves. Even after stays, first in Gloucestershire, and then Bournemouth, it had not improved a year later. Finally on 15 November 1885 he died, and was buried at Chesterfield cemetery on the 21st.

He was a member of the Central Committee of the ruling SED (party) politburo and a deputy chairman of the national Council of Ministers. He also produced a number of political publications. Life =Early years= Werner Krolikowski was born into a working-class family. He trained for office work. By the time the war ended the frontier between Poland and Germany had moved west and Krolikowski, along with millions of other Germans, had also moved, the town of his birth now being part of Poland. In 1946 he joined the newly formed Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands) in the Soviet occupation zone of what was left of Germany. =Party worker= He worked till 1950 for the council in the Malchin district, some 75 km (40 miles) south-east of Rostock, then from 1951 till 1952 for the regional party leadership at Mecklenburg. In 1952 he was appointed First secretary of the party district leadership at Ribnitz- Damgarten on the north coast. Then, in December 1952, he was relieved of his functions \\"on account of gross breach of party rules\\".\\"wegen grober Verletzung des Parteistatuts\\" Nevertheless, between 1953 and 1958 he was second and then first secretary to the party district leadership at Greifswald, then till 1960 he was secretary for Agitation and Propaganda for the party district leadership in the Rostock region in succession to Karl Zylla before, in 1973, moving to the other end of the country and taking a position as First Secretary of the Dresden district leadership, where his predecessor had been Fritz Reuter. =National politics= In 1963 Krolikowski became a member of the Party Central Committee, and in 1970 he became a member of the national People's Chamber (\\"Volkskammer\\"), where his responsibilities included membership of the assembly's National Defence Committee. In 1971 he joined the party politburo's central committee. Between 1973 and 1976 he was Secretary of the Party's Central Committee, and from 1976 right up till 1989 he was a member of the Economics Commission and of Central Committee Working Groups on the Balance of Payments and on inter-German Economic Relations. From 1976 till 1988 he was First Deputy Chairman of the German Democratic Republic's Ministerial Council. In 1988, following the sudden death of Werner Felfe (who had suffered the misfortune to be identified in western media as a possible successor to First Secretary Erich Honecker) Krolikowski regained the Central Committee secretaryship for agriculture. =Various reverses= In November 1989 The Wall came down. In November 1989 Werner Krolikowski resigned from his various public offices and on 3 December 1989 he was expelled from what had till very recently been the unchallenged ruling party in East Germany. An investigation was launched, based on \\"suspicions of abuse of office and corruption\\" (\\"Verdachts auf Amtsmi√übrauch u. Korruption\\"). In May 1990 he was charged with \\"misappropriation of state funds\\" (\\"Veruntreuung von Staatsgeldern\\") and arrested before being released on bail. However, the case was dropped on health grounds. The ambassador's insight The extent to which East Germany's leader Erich Honecker and his inner circle felt unsettled and undermined by on-going Perestroika in the Soviet Union became more widely known after Honecker himself had retired. The Soviet ambassador in East Berlin from 1983 till 1990 was a man called Vyacheslav Kochemasov, a diplomat whose experience of politics in Moscow and in East Berlin went back a long way. He gave an interview to the western press in 1992 in which he disclosed that as far back as 1986 Werner Krolikowski had told him, in confidence, that the situation in the SED Politburo had become \\"unbearable\\": policy decisions were totally driven by dogma, there was no longer any discussion, there was an absurd level of centralisation and an utterly implausible communications strategy. Something must be done: the leader must be replaced. Werner's brother Werner Krolikowski's elder brother, Herbert Krolikowski (1924-2012) was also an East German politician of eminence. Herbert never rose quite as far as Werner, but he did serve as East Germany's deputy foreign minister between 1963 and 1967 and again between 1975 and 1990. Awards * 1964 Patriotic Order of Merit * 1970 Patriotic Order of Merit * 1978 Order of Karl Marx * 1980 Patriotic Order of Merit After 1966 the \\"Patriotic Order of Merit\\", which Krolikowski received \\" (\\"for services to the people and the fatherland\\" (\\"F√ºr Verdienste um Volk und Vaterland\\") was awarded at three different levels, designated respectively bronze, silver and gold, so that particularly long standing providers of exceptional service not infrequently won it more than once.

They are specialized predators of echinoderms, and are notable for preying on the destructive crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) among others. The genus is monotypic with the single species, Paracorynactis hoplites. Taxonomy Paracorynactis hoplites is the only species classified under the genus Paracorynactis. It belongs to the family Corallimorphidae of the corralimorph order Corallimorpharia. It was first described as Corynactis hoplites by the British biologists Alfred Cort Haddon and Alice M. Shackleton in 1893. In 1980, it was transferred by the Dutch marine biologist Jacobus Cornelis den Hartog to the newly created genus Pseudocorynactis. In 2010, Oca√±a et al. noted the difference in tentacle development between this species and other members of the family Corallimorphidae. It was again transferred to a new genus, Paracorynactis. Description Paracorynactis hoplites polyps can vary in diameter from as small as only to as large as . Their tentacles end in extremely sticky balls (acrospheres) covered with stinging cells (nematocysts). Distribution and habitat Paracorynactis hoplites are known to occur in coral reefs in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, and was recently encountered in Kenya. Paracorynactis hoplites are usually attached in reef crevices and under coral ledges at a maximum depth of . Most, however, can be found within of the water's surface. Incidentally, these are areas which are also commonly used by their prey (echinoderms) for shelter. Ecology and behavior Paracorynactis hoplites polyps will continually move their tentacles in an effort to detect prey. When an acrosphere comes in contact with suitable prey, it will immediately stick unto the prey's skin while firing its stinging cells (nematocysts). The polyp then extends itself towards the prey, bringing all the other remaining acrospheres towards the prey until it is trapped. The body can extend to five times its normal length when doing this. The polyp will then slowly pull the prey towards its mouth and digest it. Once the soft tissues are dissolved, the undigested pieces of the prey (e.g. spines) are regurgitated. Small prey are swallowed whole. Larger stiff-bodied prey, however, usually only get partially eaten before escaping by breaking the captured limb(s) off (autotomy). Captured large starfish, for example, usually only lose one arm. Paracorynactis hoplites are highly efficient predators of echinoderms. They specialize in preying on sea stars and short-spined sea urchins. They are also known to prey on sea cucumbers, brittle stars, and nudibranchs to a lesser extent, which indicates that they can potentially prey upon all soft-bodied slow-moving animals. They are also believed to supplement their diet with plankton when prey is scarce, as with other corallimorphs and sea anemones. But they will also refuse additional food once a prey has been recently captured and digested. Animals with smooth shells or long spines generally seem to be rejected as prey by Paracorynactis hoplites polyps. Among them are long-spined sea urchins like Diadema setosum, Diadema savignyi, and Echinothrix calamaris. Brittle stars of the genus Ophiomastix as well as shelled gastropods are also not attacked. Paracorynactis hoplites is interesting for its ability to capture even large sea stars like horned sea stars (Protoreaster nodosus) and the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci). Polyps in diameter have been observed capturing sea stars as large as across. Paracorynactis hoplites also do not seem to be affected by the toxins of venomous echinoderms like the aforementioned crown-of-thorns starfish and the flower urchin (Toxopneustes pileolus); both of which are toxic to humans, fish, and other marine predators. Paracorynactis hoplites are also used as hosts by several symbiotic species of cleaner shrimp that aren't affected by their stinging cells. These include Thor amboinensis (sexy shrimp), Stenopus hispidus (banded coral shrimp), Ancylomenes holthuisi, and Cuapetes lacertae. Several species of fish have also been observed living among the tentacles of Paracorynactis hoplites with no adverse effects. Among them are cardinalfishes like Ostorhinchus multilineatus (multi-striped cardinalfish), Ostorhinchus nigrofasciatus (blackstripe cardinalfish), and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus (five-lined cardinalfish); and gobies like Trimma nasa (nasal dwarfgoby) and Eviota pellucida (neon pygmy goby). Importance Paracorynactis hoplites may prove valuable as natural population control measures for the highly ecologically destructive crown-of-thorns starfish.

He was named an NBL All-Star and won an NBL championship with the Melbourne Tigers, who retired his No. 25. He also had a two-year coaching stint with the Hunter Pirates. Simmons is the father of National Basketball Association (NBA) player Ben Simmons. Playing career A New York City native, Simmons attended South Bronx High School in The Bronx before playing college basketball for Oklahoma City University during the 1980s. After graduating from Oklahoma City and moving around Central and South America for a short while, Simmons signed with the Melbourne Tigers of the Australian National Basketball League in 1989. He and fellow American Dave Colbert were fan favorites in Melbourne as they brought immediate success to a booming franchise. In his first NBL game, Simmons scored 28 points against the Hobart Devils. He backed this up with a 25-point, 15-rebound effort against the Eastside Melbourne Spectres the next night. He went on to score 30 or more points seven times in his debut season, including a 40-point performance against the Brisbane Bullets on August 20. To conclude a successful season, Simmons, Colbert and Australian basketball legend Andrew Gaze helped the Tigers reach the NBL post-season for the first time in club history. Simmons continued to play with the Tigers through the early 1990s, earning All-Star honors in his second season and helped the Tigers win the NBL championship in 1993. In the spring of 1994, Simmons joined the Westchester Stallions of the United States Basketball League before returning to the Melbourne Tigers for the 1994 NBL season. Simmons was considered the ultimate team man as he adjusted his play to suit his role every season. However, following the conclusion of the 1996 season, the Tigers parted ways with Simmons as they wanted change with an import who could provide more offence than what they felt Simmons could give the team. Simmons subsequently joined the Newcastle Falcons in 1997 but managed just one season with the club. He joined the Sydney Kings a month into the 1998 season, but his stint did not last long, as he left the club after appearing in just six games. In December 1998, Simmons returned to the Newcastle Falcons, signing with the club for the rest of the 1998‚Äì99 NBL season as a replacement for sacked import Todd Mundt. Following the conclusion of the NBL season, he joined the Rockhampton Rockets for the 1999 QBL season. In September 1999, Simmons signed with the Canberra Cannons as a naturalized Australian to replace injured import Clayton Ritter. He played two seasons for the Cannons but finished his career on a sour note when he was released by the club with six games to go in the 2000‚Äì01 season due to off court issues that were not disclosed to the public. Coaching career In 2003, Simmons was hired by the Hunter Pirates as an assistant coach for the 2003‚Äì04 NBL season. However, in December 2003, he took over the head coaching job on an interim basis after the club controversially sacked Bruce Palmer just months into the Pirates' debut season. He returned to an assistant coaching role for the 2004‚Äì05 season after the club hired legendary Australian coach Dr. Adrian Hurley. Personal life Simmons is a black American who became a naturalized Australian citizen. He and his wife Julie, a white Australian, have two children: daughter Olivia and son Ben. He also has four step-children: Melissa, Emily, Liam and Sean; Emily is the wife of NFL player Michael Bush. His long-time friend, David Patrick, is the godfather of his son Ben. Patrick was an assistant coach at Louisiana State University (LSU) during Ben's lone season there. Ben Simmons was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft.

Among his other works are compositions of waltzes and marches. He also wrote secular and religious music. Biography Jos√© Rufino Reyes was born Santo Dominigo, Dominican Republic, on November 15, 1836. He was the son of Rafael Reyes, a poor retailer, and Mar√≠a Merced Siancas. They had two other children, Manuel Mar√≠a Reyes Siancas (b.1821) and Francisco Reyes Siancas. Reyes had no formal education and was raised in cottage dwelling. He was a military soldier, where he studied music with the director of the military band, Juan Bautista Fonseca. He learned various musical instruments, with primary focus on the cello. National anthem In 1882, alongside Emilio Prud'Homme, he wrote the music for what would later become the national anthem of the Dominican Republic. The following year on August 7 he premiered the composition in celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the restoration of the Republic with lyrics written by Prud'Homme, during a ceremony held at the Lodge La Esperanza. The composition was then again performed on February 27, 1884, in honor of Juan Pablo Duarte in the theater of the Republic during the occasion of the arrival of Duarte's remains in the country, which were deposited in the Chapel of the Immortals.Today his face is on the 2,000 Dominican peso bill next to Emilio Prud'Homme In 1885, the composition received its greatest public praise when it was performed by the military band teacher Betances, in the Cathedral Square and its popularity then increased on the fiftieth anniversary of the Republic. In 1896 it was nominated to be the official anthem of the country unsuccessfully. On 7 June 1897, the Congress of the Dominican Republic passed an act adopting \\"Himno Nacional\\" with the original music and revised lyrics as the country's official national anthem; however, then-President Ulises Heureaux (1846‚Äì1899) vetoed the act because the lyric's author, Prud'homme, was an opponent of the president and his administration. Death Jos√© Rufino Reyes died on January 31, 1905, without seeing the national anthem being formalized. His remains were laid to rest by the words of Federico Henriquez y Carvajal. In 1916, the Congress tried once again without results to formalize the anthem. Eventually on May 3, 1934, due to a message sent to Congress by the dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, a law was passed which established Reyes' composition as the official anthem of the Dominican Republic.

It was announced in October 2014 as the successor to the original Tesco Hudl, which was released on 30 September 2013. The device features an 8.3-inch screen, a 1.83 GHz quad-core processor and 16 GB of internal flash memory. The tablet was originally launched with Android 4.4.2 KitKat and is officially upgradeable to Android 5.1 Lollipop. On 23 October 2015, Tesco announced that the Hudl 2 had been discontinued and that no successor was planned. History The Hudl 2 was announced at a launch event on 3 October 2014 with the tagline \\"We want to show you the bigger picture\\", accompanied by the hashtag \\"#Letshudl\\".  Hardware  = Design = The Hudl 2 was available in eight colours. It has a soft coating on its back and a large front bezel. When held in landscape it is much wider and slightly slimmer than the original Hudl, though it is the same height. At 420 grams it is heavier than its predecessor and competitors; the original Hudl weighs 370g whilst the Nexus 7 (2013) weighs only 290g. =Screen and input= The Hudl 2 has an 8.3\\" IPS panel, LCD display with a resolution of HD 1920√ó1200 and a pixel density of 273 ppi. This is a significant improvement over the older model, which had a 7-in 1400√ó900 LCD display with a pixel density of 242 ppi. The screen is less bright than the older model. The screen features a multi-touch capacitive panel, and contained within the device is a gyroscopic sensor, 3-axis accelerometer and an ambient light sensor. It is possible to connect the Hudl to an external display through use of the onboard HDMI port. = Audio and output = The hudl2 has speakers on the back of the device, in the format of speaker holes in two rows at each side of the tablet. There is also a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack. = Battery = Tesco claimed that the battery could last up to 8 hours (depending on use), an hour more than the original Hudl. = Storage = The Hudl 2 comes with 16GB of internal storage of which approximately 9GB is available to the user. The total storage capacity of the Hudl 2 is expandable through the microSD card slot up to 32GB. With the 5.1 Lollipop update, the Hudl 2 officially supports 128GB cards (formatted FAT32).  Accessories  There was a wide range of accessories available for the Hudl 2. Tesco offers: * stylised cases * a variety of styli * a pair of children‚Äôs headphones * earbud headphones * screen protectors * car charging kits Software and applications The tablet runs on Google‚Äôs Android operating system, giving it some advanced features such as voice search. It has access to Google‚Äôs collection of apps including Chrome and Google Maps. It also has some of the same software as the first hudl such as BlinkBox, allowing the user to purchase or rent films. The Hudl 2 comes with new e-reader software for viewing e-books. As it is Tesco‚Äôs product, there is an emphasis on encouraging the users to continue or start shopping in Tesco by having services such as Tesco Direct and Tesco Bank in folders available from the homescreen. The 'My Tesco' launcher is present as it was for the first hudl, allowing the users to access shopping interests such as their Clubcard account or to find their nearest Tesco store. = Child use = Tesco promote the Hudl 2 as a family tablet. Their dedicated child safety app comes bundled in an attempt to achieve this goal. This app lets a user create a separate account for each user and limits accessible web content based on the user's age range. Other features of the child safety app include being able to control the amount of time users are allowed to use the device each day and the ability to block entire apps from users. Reception With its low price of ¬£129, most expected the hudl2 to be similar to its predecessor, an accessory to laptops. Instead reviewers were impressed by the specifications of the tablet for its price point. Chris Finnamore of ExpertReviews rated it 5/5, calling it a \\"vast improvement\\" over the Hudl 1. CNET wrote \\"it has more than enough to satisfy most families and its wealth of parental control information will help you arm your kids with the knowledge they need to stay safe online\\". The parental control options were lauded by other reviewers as well; AndroidCentral describes how \\"owners are asked if they wish to configure the hudl2 to block sensitive content, restrict the amount of time a child can use the product, and more\\". A shared point of praise among reviews was that of the hudl2‚Äôs strong push towards family and less savvy customer usage. The Independent were particularly impressed with the Get Started app. They said \\"Get Started offers comprehensive and clear tips on how to use the tablet for everything from shopping to gaming, as well as showing some basic security measures and ways to share the Hudl safely amongst family members\\". Despite the many successes of the hudl2, reviewers were displeased with some of the more fundamental specifications. The five megapixel camera was described as \\"shoddy\\" by The Independent, and many reviewers were unimpressed with the battery life. As with many tablets, the hudl2 comes with several preinstalled apps of varying usefulness which cannot be removed but can be disabled. The \\"My Tesco\\" launcher is preinstalled as the default launcher, though has been described as \\"sluggish\\" by TechRadar. Discontinuation On 23 October 2015, Tesco announced that it would no longer be stocking the Hudl 2 although it would continue offering technical support to existing owners. While it did not explain the reason behind the decision, the company had been pursuing a strategy to focus on its core bricks-and-mortar grocery business which had already seen it sell off or close its video streaming and e-book operations. The announcement came one week after Tesco had announced that it had no plans for a Hudl 3 and \\"nothing planned at the moment\\" in the sector. According to Marketing Magazine, a number of key people who had worked on the Hudl project, including its lead Android engineer and product managers, were no longer with Tesco.

The orchestra composes and performs original scores to accompany films of the Silent Era, provides musical scores in collaborative multidisciplinary performances, records soundtrack music for contemporary films, and regularly performs at various music venues. Origins and history Started in late 2008 as a studio project by Pete Petrisko, the orchestra transformed into a live multiple-member ensemble in 2009. Its line-up varied, between three and seven musicians, until 2012, when group membership solidified with Petrisko, Jim Dustan, Jocelyn Ruiz, and Vic Void playing together regularly. Erik Hunter joined in 2014, officially making the ensemble a quintet. Cited as a \\"band staffed by futurists and dadaists who take the sounds of the past and filter them into the heads of today's audiences\\", the orchestra is most identified with dieselpunk music - combining elements of Jazz, Swing, and Bluegrass commonly found during the Diesel Era, with its own unique instrumentation and avant-garde composition. Additionally, it draws from the \\"noise\\" aesthetic of Proto-Industrial music harkening back to the Russian avant-garde period. The orchestra favors Electroacoustic music and Acousmatic sound techniques, and the use of contact microphones, in addition to traditional instruments, when creating elements of its music. Its eclectic sound has not gone unnoticed, RPM Orchestra holds distinction as the \\"Oddest Band in Phoenix\\". Best known for composing original scores to accompany films of the Silent Era, performed in front of a theater audience during screenings, RPM Orchestra was awarded Best of Phoenix 2018 - Best Live Accompaniment by Phoenix New Times, which wrote, \\"Combining old-timey instrumentation with radio sounds, haunting samples, and modern noise, RPM creates compelling and timeless soundscapes.\\" Discography =Albums= *Afterglow (2009, Onewordlong) *Roundabout (2010, suRRism-Phonoethics) *Blossoms (2012, Absence of Wax) *Three Uses of the Knife (2013, Sirona Records) *Hit on all Sixes (2015, 56th Street Records) *Canary (2015, suRRism-Phonoethics) *Stepwise (2017, Onus Records) =EPs= Live orchestra's 10th Anniversary double- release: *Singles (2019, self-released) *Tenfold (2019, self-released) =Compilations= *The Sepiachord Almanac (2012) *When in AZ Vol. 2 (2018) Film scores RPM Orchestra is listed in the Silent Film Musicians Directory, a comprehensive worldwide compendium of modern-day silent film musicians and composers. =Silent Era feature film scores= *Tod Browning's The Unknown (1927), premiered 2011. *D.W.

The rapids began below the present-day city of Dnipro where the river turns to the south, and dropped 50 meters in 66 kilometers, ending before the present-day city of Zaporizhia (whose name literally means beyond the rapids). There were nine major rapids along this path (although some sources give a smaller number) which almost totally obstructed the river for navigation. Also, there were about 30-40 smaller rapids and 60 islands and islets. After the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station was built in 1932, they were inundated by the Dnieper Reservoir. Historic mentions The Dnieper Rapids were part of the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks first mentioned in the Primary Chronicle. The route was probably established in the late eighth and early ninth centuries and gained significant importance from the tenth until the first third of the eleventh century. On the Dnieper the Varangians had to portage their ships round seven rapids, where they had to be on guard for Pecheneg nomads. The existence of the rapids was mentioned in Emperor Constantine VII's work De Administrando ImperioAn English translation of De Administrando Imperio. and in The Tale of Igor's Campaign. Names of the major rapids In Ukrainian tradition, there were 9 major rapids (given in the direction of the river flow as shown in the picture on the right):–Ø–≤–æ—Ä–Ω–∏—Ü—å–∫–∏–π –î.–Ü. –î–Ω—ñ–ø—Ä–æ–≤—ñ –ø–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∏:–ê–ª—å–±–æ–º —Ñ–æ—Ç–æ–≥—Ä. –∑ –≥–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ—ñ—á–Ω–æ-—ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á. –Ω–∞—Ä–∏—Å–æ–º ‚Äî –•–∞—Ä–∫—ñ–≤: –ü–µ—Ä—à–∞ –¥—Ä—É–∫–∞—Ä–Ω—è –¥–µ—Ä–∂. –≤–∏–¥–∞–≤–Ω–∏—Ü—Ç–≤–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏, 1928. ‚Äî –°. 41.(in Ukrainian)–û–º–µ–ª—å—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ –ì. –ú. –°–ø–æ–≥–∞–¥–∏ –ª–æ—Ü–º–∞–Ω–∞ –ø–æ—Ä–æ–≥—ñ–≤ –î–Ω—ñ–ø—Ä–æ–≤–∏—Ö.- –î–Ω—ñ–ø—Ä–æ–ø–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤—Å—å–∫: –°—ñ—á, 1998.(in Ukrainian) # Kodatsky ().

He grew up in Bairnsdale in the East Gippsland region of Victoria. Though his first name was Lachlan by birth, he insisted on being called Lock or Lockie. Career Lock and his family built his first boat, a trimaran called Bunyip, in 1959 while he was still a teenager. In 1960 he raced in the Easter regatta at Paynesville, Victoria, Australia, and won against a field of 300 boats. This initial success inspired others to build similar boats. Crowther then studied electrical engineering in Melbourne and in the early 1960s became involved in multihull design and the Amateur Yacht Research Society. In 1962 Trio was built based upon his designs. Crowther's next design was the Kraken 25, garnering some recognition. Later, Lockie decided to give up his day job in Melbourne and move to Sydney to design multihulls full-time. In 1969, a Kraken 40 won the New York to Bermuda race with him aboard. Crowther's first offshore racing trimaran, Bandersnatch, won the Sydney to Hobart multihull race in 1996. Legacy During Crowther's career, over 2500 of his designs were built. A notable design was the trimaran Spirit of America, an early user of GRP-foam sandwich construction featuring composite beams with unidirectional fibres and turned-down ends. Crowther also developed 'bulbous bows' to reduce pitching, and thus increase speed when sailing upwind in a swell. After Crowther's death in 1993, Crowther Designs was run by his son, Brett. Based in northern Sydney, it merged with Incat Designs - Sydney in 2005 to form Incat Crowther. Some Crowther designs are now offered through Melbourne-based Bloomfield Innovation, run by a former associate.

New York: Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data, 2006. Print. Sensory dysfunction disorder is not recognized by the American Medical Association. \\"Sensory processing (SP) difficulties have been reported in as many as 95% of children with autism, however, empirical research examining the existence of specific patterns of SP difficulties within this population is scarce.\\" The brain receives messages from the body's sensory systems, which informs the brain of what is going on around and to a person's body. If one or more of these systems become overstimulated, it may result in what is known as Sensory Dysfunction Disorder. An example of a response to overstimulation is expressed by A. Jean Ayres, in Sensory Integration and the Child: Understanding Hidden Sensory Challenges. She writes, \\"When the flow of sensations is disorganized, life can be like a rush-hour traffic jam‚Äù (p. 289).Ayres, A. Jean Sensory Integration and the Child: Understanding Hidden Sensory Challenges. Los Angeles, CA: Western Psychological Services, 2005. Print. The following sensory systems are broken down into individual categories to better understand the impact a sensitivity can have on an individual.Emmons, Polly Godwin, and Liz McKendry Anderson. Understanding Sensory Dysfunction: Learning, Development and Sensory Dysfunction in Autism Spectrum Disorders, ADHD, Learning Disabilities and Bipolar Disorder. Philadelphia, PA: Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 2005. Print. Systems =Tactile system= The tactile system is the sense of touch. Someone with Sensory Dysfunction Disorder may have symptoms of not being able to process any form of physical connection. Conversely, a person may need to have some sort of physical connection to soothe an anxiety he or she is experiencing. =Vestibular system= The vestibular system includes motor skills, equilibrium, and timing. A child with Sensory Dysfunction Disorder may have a difficult time in sports or sensing the perimeters of his or her surroundings. Sometimes movement for a person can result in a soothing sensation or cause stress, depending on how that individual perceives the information. =Proprioceptive system= The proprioceptive system concerns a person's joints and muscles. It tells the brain if a part of the body is moving without actually having to see it. It also controls eating, writing, and using utensils. This sense enables a person to understand the amount of pressure used to carry out routine tasks, such as eating and writing. Bodily pressure is part of this as well; for example, a child may enjoy being held tighter by someone or leaning into things such as walls, desks, and potentially other people. =Olfactory system= The olfactory system is considered the sense of smell. People with Sensory Dysfunction Disorder could have difficulty with certain fragrances or odors. Conversely, they may find certain smells to be soothing, and use them to calm themselves. =Gustatory system= The Gustatory system concerns a person's taste and sense of smell. A child with Sensory Dysfunction Disorder may not be able to tolerate the texture or taste of certain foods. Their senses may not respond well to food, and they may be unable to smell food that is burning. =Auditory system= The auditory system deals with hearing. Children with Sensory Dysfunction Disorder may feel that certain noises are painful or overwhelming. They may need to cover their ears when hearing a sound or in anticipation of what they think will be an offensive sound. They can find certain music to be soothing and become mesmerized by it. However, they may become overstimulated and upset if they hear something for which they are unprepared. =Visual system= The visual system involves sight. A child with Sensory Dysfunction Disorder may or may not be able to see an item that is directly in front of them. He or she may be sensitive to certain lighting. A child who struggles with some sort of sensory sensitivity can also have a difficult time with emotional control. His or her brain may be unable to fully comprehend what is happening in his or her surroundings, which can cause confusion and lead to extreme behavior issues. This could result in intense outbursts and anxiety. During such episodes, children are no longer able to receive any audio information that is generally used to calm them. \\\\- Authored an article, Sensory Dysfunction in Children \\\\- Researched information for article through internet and medical booksde\\"/> They become unresponsive to any disciplinary actions that may typically be used. Their brain reaches a state of sensory overload and any new information, such as conversation to alter their current state of mind, becomes ineffective. They need to calm themselves and let their brains slow down. The Mislabeled Child The Mislabeled Child, written by Brock Eide, and Fernette Eide, provides information that can improve the messages to the brain for children with Sensory Dysfunction Disorder, so they may become more responsive to their senses that ordinarily overwhelm them. The authors suggest that with specified therapy, namely from Occupational Therapists, messages may be rerouted, creating a new nerve tract through the brain. Treatment of Sensory Dysfunction Disorder has several steps because there are many areas of concern. Treatment can improve with parental involvement and repetition. The Mislabeled Child has compiled a list of steps to help with Sensory Dysfunction Disorder: #Making the world more sensory-friendly #Managing sensory-seeking behaviors #Managing sensory-avoidant behaviors #Improving whole-body balance and movement #Improving fine-motor function #Improving emotional regulation\\" (p. 314) Step one is important to a child with sensory dysfunction because this is where they receive their stimuli that can cause them to become overstimulated. Understanding the specific elements that may cause the initial anxiety and removing or altering it, can ease a child's anxiety levels and lessen confusion. Step two suggests that certain behaviors and activities may be calming for the child. Finding activities that involve movement, whether full motor skills or fine motor skills, can be helpful. Activity and exercise can strengthen these senses. Step three states that this dysfunction concerns a person's senses, meaning there are specific triggers that may exacerbate behaviors causing the child to stay away from that particular irritant. This could involve the use of a 'sensory diet'. It is noted in the book The Mislabeled Child that \\"Improving sensitivities in multiple senses often does not require specific desensitization therapies for each one, because our sensory systems are so highly linked, or integrated. Addressing sensitivities in one area often improves sensitivities in many areas\\" (p. 324). Step four includes strengthening gross motor skills, which can build better muscle tone through play, enabling children to have more control over their own body. Children may struggle with balance and ability in activities because they lack gross motor skills. As a child's gross motor skills inform the brain about a person's surroundings, the brain becomes confused and inhibits their reactions to their surroundings. Step five recommends that children who struggle with fine motor skills dealing primarily with their fingers and hands, need to do exercises, such as pinch grip, cutting, and writing, to strengthen them. An Occupational therapist works with the child to develop these skills. Being unable to use their fine motor skills makes it very difficult and frustrating for a child to write properly and can cause the child to avoid doing anything involving handwriting and similar situations. Lastly, in step six, as the child matures it is important to help him or her to become more aware of how their response to their own senses and learn to understand what their bodies are doing. Once they are able to learn these cues, they can help themselves by knowing when it is time to take a break and regain control over themselves. The Out-of-Sync Child There are ways that children with Sensory Dysfunction Disorder may still have fun. The book The Out-of-Sync Child Has Fun Activities for Kids with Sensory Processing Disorder, written by Carol Stock Kranowitz, M.A., provides different activities for the various sensory systems.Kranowitz, M.A. Carol Stock. The Out-Of-Sync Child Has Fun Activities for Kids with Sensory Processing Disorder. New York: Penguin Group (USA) Inc., 2003. Print. These activities can be tools to help strengthen these senses. Recognition of the disorder The American Psychiatric Association does not recognize Sensory Dysfunction Disorder as a medical diagnosis.Brennan, M.D. Daniel. \\"Health & Parenting Sensory Processing Disorder.\\" WebMD. Daniel Brennan, M.D. Osteoarthritis Treatment, 10 May 2014. Web. 6 Nov. 2014. Daniel Brennan also comments on this in his article \\"Health and Parenting Sensory Processing Disorder\\" and further proposes that it is typically paralleled with another disorder such as ADHD, autism spectrum, and countless other disorders, rather than as its own disorder.

It lies at one end of the Maspalomas beach, south of the resort town centre, next to the area known as the Maspalomas Dunes. The lighthouse is a distinctive landmark in the resort, and is the tallest masonry lighthouse in the Canaries at being superseded only by the more modern concrete Morro Jable lighthouse on Fuerteventura. With a focal height of above the sea, its light can be seen for 19 nautical miles, and consists of a pattern of three flashes of white light, over a period of thirteen seconds.  Construction and equipment  This lighthouse is a construction conceived by the engineer Juan Le√≥n y Castillo as a luminous complex made up of two main bodies, the house of the bullfighter and the tower. The house, with a rectangular floor plan, was developed from a traditional idea such as the Canarian patio, but the four facades of the building are aided by the eclectic fashion of the period in which it was built. The dwelling, attached to the base of the tower, acts as a plinth that counteracts the thrusts of the tower. left The decision to build a lighthouse in Maspalomas dates from 19th of June 1861, but it was not until 1884 that Juan de Le√≥n y Castillo was commissioned to draw up the project. The works lasted until 1889 and the lighthouse emitted its first flash of light on the night of its commissioning, 1st February 1890. The tower, presented to the sea, in the southern part of the set, is a truncated cone cylinder that has an average diameter in the upper body of 6.20 meters, a height of 54.70 meters and at its summit is located the lantern, so that the set reaches a height of 60 meters. It has a classic shaft design whose section decreases as it approaches its capital, finished off with rings and modules. Its facade has a succession of elongated vertical openings, which give light to the staircase leading up to the lantern and, at the top, under the capital, a small glazed lamp whose purpose is rather ornamental. The colour of the tower is blue-grey, typical of the masonry with which it is built in its entirety. The lantern is a glass dome of 3.7 meters in diameter, covered at the top. Inside it are the optics, the reflectors and the 1000-watt halogen lamp, which emits a white light at the rate of a group of a slow flash with a 1+2 frequency of 13 seconds between groups. The flashes have a nominal night-time range of 19 nautical miles. The lighthouse is located in Punta de Maspalomas, at the end of Maspalomas beach, next to the dune field, pool and oasis of the same name; tourist area in the greatest degree in the south of the island of Gran Canaria. It is the most popular lighthouse in the Canary Islands, considered an emblematic symbol and one of the best known monuments in Gran Canaria and the municipality of San Bartolom√© de Tirajana. In addition to being recognized as an Asset of General Interest, it is one of the oldest lighthouses still in operation in the Canary Islands. It is fully automated and operates using conventional electrical power connected to the public grid. It has annexed rooms at the foot of the tower, in a two-storey building of eclectic style. This building is attached to the tower on its north side and is a rectangular construction, symmetrical in the arrangement of its doors and windows, whose perimeters are outlined in stone. Its corners and a cornice that finishes off the entire upper part also make use of ashlars to harmonise the whole. Above the entrance to the building there is a small balcony made of tea wood and inside there is a patio that serves as a distributor to give access to all the rooms and to the tower itself. In them are the different rooms, warehouses and the room that the lighthouse keeper had; as well as a generator and the corresponding batteries to guarantee the operation in case of disconnection or failure in the electrical network.  The lighthouse as a Landmark and future uses  The profile of the Maspalomas Lighthouse is very characteristic and it is integrated in the tourist urbanization of Meloneras which is close to it and can be distinguished from other places in the south of Gran Canaria such as Campo Internacional or Playa del Ingl√©s. The silhouette of the lighthouse and the Maspalomas Dunes are a unique icon that serves to recognize the Maspalomas Costa Canaria brand as a unique tourist destination. The Maspalomas Lighthouse was declared a Property of Cultural Interest in the category of Historical Monument by the Canary Islands Government in 2005. Its protected area is 5225.72 square meters along a perimeter of 318.15 linear meters. Faro de Maspalomas, May 2018 -2 On the occasion of Christmas 2005, the lighthouse was decorated, for the first time in its history, with Christmas lights. The micro-bulbs were placed by the Town Hall of San Bartolom√© de Tirajana along the entire length of the tower, managing to enhance its height and showiness both in the distance and from the tourist enclave of Meloneras. Since 2007, part of the lighthouse premises have been used for specific cultural purposes and a small permanent cultural centre is planned. In 2011 and after the San Bartolom√© Town Hall gave up its concession, a new concession agreement was signed between Puertos del Estado and the Cabildo de Gran Canaria, interested in housing an Ethnographic Interpretation Centre, a craft shop and a tourist information point. The Foundation for the Ethnography and Development of Canarian Crafts (FEDAC), as an autonomous body of the Cabildo of Gran Canaria, is responsible for the tendering of the works and the setting up of the said Centre. In February 2019, the Maspalomas Lighthouse reopened to the public after ten years of closure. While waiting for the museographic project for the Ethnographic Interpretation Centre to be awarded and executed, the Maspalomas Lighthouse can be visited with an exhibition of craftsmanship in the context of the rural houses of Gran Canaria together with objects of daily use until the middle of the 20th century. It also has contemporary products from the textile sector inspired by traditional craft techniques. It also has a doll's house from 1930 with seventeen rooms.

Facts Lehman Brothers International (Europe) was the UK subsidiary of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, the US parent that had gone in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. It had held money on behalf of many clients, including some affiliates of Lehman. The client money rules of Financial Services Authority were in the Client Assets Sourcebook, chapter 7, issued under the FSMA 2000 section 138. FSMA 2000 section 139 permitted FSA rulemaking for ‚Äòclients‚Äô money being held on trust in accordance with the rules‚Äô, and accordingly CASS 7.7.2R said that client money was to be held on trust for the purpose of the client money rules. If a firm failed, the client money distribution rules in CASS 7.9 applied. But under CASS 7.4, a firm could either (1) pay money into a segregated account or (2) put the money into the firm's own house accounts and then segregate it into client accounts at the close of the preceding day's business. Lehman had done the alternative approach in (2). On 15 September 2008, Lehman went into administration, a ‚Äòprimary pooling event‚Äô under CASS 7, so the funds in each ‚Äòclient money account‚Äô were to be treated as pooled and then distributed so that each client received a sum rateable to their ‚Äòclient money entitlement‚Äô. The administrators asked the High Court for directions under the Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, about how to apply CASS 7 to the client money that Lehman held. There was a lot of unsegregated client money in the firm's house accounts because of the operation of the alternative approach, and also significant non-compliance of Lehman with CASS 7 over a long time. Judgment =High Court= Briggs J held the statutory trust imposed on the client's funds under CASS 7 arose as soon as a firm received them.[2009] EWHC 3228 (Ch) This was to achieve better protection as required by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004/39/EC, article 13(7) and the Implementing Directive 2006/73/EC art 16. The term ‚Äòclient money account‚Äô, for what money needed to be pooled under CASS 7.9.6R referred to segregated accounts of a client, not any other account of the firm, so it excluded identifiable client money in house accounts. The pool was to be distributed only among clients whose funds had been placed in segregated accounts. =Court of Appeal= Lord Neuberger MR, Arden LJ and Sir Mark Waller dismissed Lehman Brothers Holding Inc's appeal on the timing of the statutory trust, but allowed the appeal of a representative of Lehman's non-segregated clients and two affiliates.Under case the name of Lehman Brothers International (Europe) v CRC Credit Fund Ltd [2010] EWCA Civ 917 It held the pool comprised all identifiable client money the firm's hands, and all were entitled to participate in the pool. A representative of the secured clients appealed. Arden LJ said the following.[2010] EWCA Civ 917, [171] Lord Neuberger MR concurred, saying the following. =Supreme Court= Lord Clarke, Lord Dyson and Lord Collins held that, dismissing the appeal, CASS 7 was to be construed according to the purpose of the MiFiD 2004/39/EC and 2006/73/EC, to achieve a high level of protection for client money, with the prompt and scrupulous segregation of funds. The statutory trust created by CASS 7.7.2R arose on receipt of the client money, and the fiduciary duties imposed by CASS 7 were owed by LBIE in respect of all client money, not just balances standing to credit in client accounts. The decision that fiduciary duties were owed by a firm in respect of all client money was relevant to construe CASS 7. If there was a choice of interpretations, then the one chosen should be the highest level of protection. Although CASS 7 used trust concepts, it was not meant to limit trust law. CASS 7.9.6R(2) referred to a client's contractual entitlement when it said ‚Äòclient money entitlement‚Äô to have money segregated. Lord Clarke said the following.[110] Lord Dyson gave the leading judgment. Lord Collins gave a concurring judgment. Lord Hope gave the initial opinion, but dissented, saying the following. Lord Walker dissented.

The market opened in 1928. When the market opened it consisted of 12 retail shops and, on the second floor, a 22 lane bowling alley. The market's location, at the cross section between Charles Street and Maryland Avenue, was originally the site of two country homes, including the site of Confederate General Bradley Tyler Johnson's former residence. With the rapid growth of North Baltimore in the early 20th century the area was no longer \\"country\\". The market hosted close to 50,000 people on its opening day. It soon grew to have over 200 grocery vendors. After World War II many businesses began to leave the Baltimore city area, to the point where there were only 30 stalls in use in 1968. In that year a fire shut down a large portion of the market. After the fire, the market was purchased by the owners of Center City, Inc., James and Carolyn Frenkil. The northern part of the market was razed to build a 17-story retirement home, while the rest of the building was turned into a supermarket. The heart of the building remained vacant for nearly 40 years. In 2008, a $1 million project was created to restore the main market building to create an art-focused group of shops, restaurants, and offices. In 2012, the project received a grant from the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development and Central Baltimore Partnership to upgrade the facility with new paint, new lighting, and re-open exterior windows.

The Sanok-Turka mountain range stretches on an area of 930 km¬≤ to the north of the Bieszczady Mountains, and to the south of the Przemyskie Upland, between the valleys of the middle San and Stryi River. They extend after the river Stryi by the Beskidy Brze≈ºne.

The southern border is generally carried through the ridges of the Otryt mountain range and through the San where the Tyrawski river joins as a tributary, although sometimes the Otryt mountain range is linked with the Sanocko-Turcza≈Ñskie mountains, then the southern border is the Upper San river.http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/tacitusc/germany/map.html The highest peak of the mountain range is Magura ≈Åomnia≈Ñska (with a height of 1024 metres), while on the Polish side of the border the highest peak is Jaworniki at 909 metres, (or Trohaniec if you use the expanded border at a height of 939 metres).

In the German historiography as Sanoker Berge, Berge Saana and Samborer Berge. According to the story of Tacitus, this area was described as Bastarnae Alpes, qui alias Carpathia Montes on the outskirts of the Hercynian Forest. The second part of the current name comes from the town of Turka.http://www.crtpesaro.it/Materiali/Latino/De%20Origine%20Et%20Situ%20Germanorum.php Events *According to the Hypatian Codex, in the spring of 1099 the Hungarian King Coloman crossed the Carpathian Mountains hitting the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia, where at the Battle of Wiar he suffered a spectacular defeat. Even in the sixteenth century Hungarian writers have argued that no defeat is not greater than that of their nation. According to Jan D≈Çugosz this battle had killed more than 8,000 Hungarians. *In 1377, Louis I of Hungary and Poland, crossed through the Sanok Mountains heading to Russia against the Lithuanian troops. *In 1941, the Molotov Line intersecting the mountains crashed German-Slovak troops in the Operation Barbarossa.

Biography  He came from a humble, working-class family. His father died early and his mother had to support the family doing laundry, so he spent much of his youth in poverty. Later, he was apprenticed to a Master Painter whose drunken, abusive behavior made him seek a way to escape, so he began saving his money with the goal of becoming an artist. Originally, he enrolled at the \\"School of Fine and Applied Arts\\", where he attended night classes while supporting himself by house-painting. In 1899, he was able to spend a few months in Munich, attending classes taught by Ludwig von Herterich at the Academy of Fine Arts,Brief biography @ the Magyar Elektronikus K√∂nyvt√°r but his financial necessities continued to prevent him from attending daytime classes so he ended up being essentially self-taught and able to paint only in his spare time. Self-portrait with his hat (date unknown) At first, he developed his style by painting still lifes, self-portraits and portraits of his mother, engaged in household chores. Then, perhaps under the influence of Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, he decided to focus on painting the workers he knew so well from his youth. For many years, he remained reluctant to show his works in public or part with them. What little money he earned from working went mostly to painting supplies. He eventually became a local \\"character\\", who was readily recognizable by the very old, floppy hat he always wore. In 1915, he joined the Army and received a wound that resulted in his right arm being paralyzed, but he continued to work as best he could with his left hand. One day, his neighbors heard a loud crash and rushed to his apartment, where they found him lying on his back, clutching his brush. He was taken to the hospital, but died shortly after arriving there. His friend, the art critic and writer Jen≈ë B√°lint (1889-1945) arranged for a quick, private (and apparently somewhat secret) burial at the New Public Cemetery. Within ten years, his neglected grave had disappeared. Due to the political unrest at the time, his first exhibition wasn't staged until 1922 at the Museum of Fine Arts. After 1945, when the Communist government took power and social realism in the arts was being promoted, his paintings gained official approbation. In 1959, on the anniversary of his death, a major exhibition was held at the Hungarian National Gallery. A commemorative stamp with one of his self- portraits was issued in 1969 and a statue in his honor (showing him in his trademark hat), by , was created in 1975 and placed in K√≥s K√°roly Park.

The board has 14 digital I/O pins (six capable of PWM output), 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), via a type B USB cable. It can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. It is similar to the Arduino Nano and Leonardo.https://arduino.cc https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-leonardo-with-headers The hardware reference design is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share- Alike 2.5 license and is available on the Arduino website.

The Uno board is the first in a series of USB-based Arduino boards; it and version 1.0 of the Arduino IDE were the reference versions of Arduino, which have now evolved to newer releases. The ATmega328 on the board comes preprogrammed with a bootloader that allows uploading new code to it without the use of an external hardware programmer. While the Uno communicates using the original STK500 protocol, it differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip.

History  an early production board The Arduino project started at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea (IDII) in Ivrea, Italy. At that time, the students used a BASIC Stamp microcontroller, at a cost that was a considerable expense for many students. In 2003, Hernando Barrag√°n created the development platform Wiring as a Master's thesis project at IDII, under the supervision of Massimo Banzi and Casey Reas, who are known for work on the Processing language. The project goal was to create simple, low-cost tools for creating digital projects by non-engineers. The Wiring platform consisted of a printed circuit board (PCB) with an ATmega168 microcontroller, an IDE based on Processing, and library functions to easily program the microcontroller. In 2003, Massimo Banzi, with David Mellis, another IDII student, and David Cuartielles, added support for the cheaper ATmega8 microcontroller to Wiring. But instead of continuing the work on Wiring, they forked the project and renamed it Arduino. Early arduino boards used the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip and an ATmega168. The Uno differed from all preceding boards by featuring the ATmega328P microcontroller and an ATmega16U2 (Atmega8U2 up to version R2) programmed as a USB-to-serial converter.  Technical specifications  * Microcontroller: Microchip ATmega328P * Operating Voltage: 5 Volts * Input Voltage: 7 to 20 Volts * Digital I/O Pins: 14 (of which 6 can provide PWM output) *UART: 1 *I2C: 1 *SPPI: 1 * Analog Input Pins: 6 * DC Current per I/O Pin: 20 mA * DC Current for 3.3V Pin: 50 mA * Flash Memory: 32 KB of which 0.5 KB used by bootloader * SRAM: 2 KB * EEPROM: 1 KB * Clock Speed: 16 MHz * Length: 68.6 mm * Width: 53.4 mm * Weight: 25 g  Headers  Arduino UNO = General pin functions = * LED: There is a built-in LED driven by digital pin 13. When the pin is high value, the LED is on, when the pin is low, it is off. * VIN: The input voltage to the Arduino/Genuino board when it is using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or other regulated power source). You can supply voltage through this pin, or, if supplying voltage via the power jack, access it through this pin. * 5V: This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7 - 20V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin of the board (7-20V). Supplying voltage via the 5V or 3.3V pins bypasses the regulator, and can damage the board. * 3V3: A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 50 mA. * GND: Ground pins. * IOREF: This pin on the Arduino/Genuino board provides the voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates. A properly configured shield can read the IOREF pin voltage and select the appropriate power source, or enable voltage translators on the outputs to work with the 5V or 3.3V. * Reset: Typically used to add a reset button to shields that block the one on the board. = Special pin functions = Each of the 14 digital pins and 6 analog pins on the Uno can be used as an input or output, under software control (using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions). They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive 20 mA as the recommended operating condition and has an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50K ohm. A maximum of 40mA must not be exceeded on any I/O pin to avoid permanent damage to the microcontroller. The Uno has 6 analog inputs, labeled A0 through A5; each provides 10 bits of resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). By default, they measure from ground to 5 volts, though it is possible to change the upper end of the range using the AREF pin and the analogReference() function. In addition, some pins have specialized functions: * Serial / UART: pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. These pins are connected to the corresponding pins of the ATmega8U2 USB-to-TTL serial chip. * External interrupts: pins 2 and 3. These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value. * PWM (pulse-width modulation): pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Can provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function. * SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface): pins 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), and 13 (SCK). These pins support SPI communication using the SPI library. * TWI (two-wire interface) / I¬≤C: pin SDA (A4) and pin SCL (A5). Support TWI communication using the Wire library. * AREF (analog reference): Reference voltage for the analog inputs.  Communication  The Arduino/Genuino Uno has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another Arduino/Genuino board, or other microcontrollers. The ATmega328 provides UART TTL (5V) serial communication, which is available on digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). An ATmega16U2 on the board channels this serial communication over USB and appears as a virtual com port to software on the computer. The 16U2 firmware uses the standard USB COM drivers, and no external driver is needed. However, on Windows, a .inf file is required. Arduino Software (IDE) includes a serial monitor which allows simple textual data to be sent to and from the board. The RX and TX LEDs on the board will flash when data is being transmitted via the USB-to-serial chip and USB connection to the computer (but not for serial communication on pins 0 and 1). A SoftwareSerial library allows serial communication on any of the Uno's digital pins. = Automatic (software) reset = Rather than requiring a physical press of the reset button before an upload, the Arduino/Genuino Uno board is designed in a way that allows it to be reset by software running on a connected computer. One of the hardware flow control lines (DTR) of the ATmega8U2/16U2 is connected to the reset line of the ATmega328 via a 100 nanofarad capacitor. When this line is asserted (taken low), the reset line drops long enough to reset the chip. This setup has other implications. When the Uno is connected to a computer running Mac OS X or Linux, it resets each time a connection is made to it from software (via USB). For the following half-second or so, the bootloader is running on the Uno. While it is programmed to ignore malformed data (i.e. anything besides an upload of new code), it will intercept the first few bytes of data sent to the board after a connection is opened.

This scheme maximises the amplifier gain but has narrower bandwidth than staggered tuning. * Double-tuned amplifier. This scheme is used on amplifier stages that are transformer-coupled rather than capacitor coupled. Both the primary and secondary coils of the transformer are tuned. This has the effect of widening the bandwidth. Other tuning schemes are sometimes called single-tuned to distinguish them.

It was designed by Charles William Thomas Fulton for his own use and was built in 1940. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2000.  History  Charles Fulton's residence, 1944 The Fulton Residence was designed in 1940 by Charles Fulton as his own home. The house was designed in a modified international style and won the 1948 Queensland Royal Australian Institute of Architects award for meritorious architecture. Charles Fulton choose to build his home at a time when the inner western suburbs of St Lucia and Taringa were being opened up for development. This development was stimulated by the move of the University of Queensland to St Lucia. Architects were particularly attracted to these suburbs because of the topography and vegetation and the area developed a reputation for innovative and experimental domestic design. In the post-war period a number of architects settled in the St Lucia area, including of Karl Langer, Edwin James Hayes, Campbell Royston Scott and Vitaly Gzell. Charles Fulton was born in Sydney in 1906 and received his architectural training as an articled pupil of Francis Ernest Stowe, architect and civil engineer. In 1931-1932 he worked in London as a draftsman for Rudder and Grout and then B George Architects. During this period he travelled in Europe and made pilgrimages looking at buildings. He was particularly interested in the work of Dutch architect Willem Dudok, whose Hilverusm Town Hall was influential in Britain in the early thirties. In 1933 he returned to Australia and settled in Brisbane where he was employed by Hall and Cook. In 1937 he entered into partnership with John Patrick Donoghue. In the same year he also became lecturer in charge of Architecture at the Brisbane Central Technical College and he taught in the architecture school for 33 years. He made a large contribution to architectural education throughout his whole career and the Queensland University of Technology named its architecture facility the \\"Charles Fulton School of Architecture\\" in his honour. Charles Fulton was a key practitioner and teacher of the modern trends in architectural design in Queensland during the late thirties and forties. The Masel Residence at Stanthorpe (1938), Nudgee Junior College Indooroopilly (1938) and his own residence all received meritorious architecture awards in the early Royal Australian Institute of Architects Queensland Awards Programs. Aside from their domestic work the practice of Donoghue and Fulton was renowned as hospital architects who combined the latest ideas in hospital planning with recent developments in architectural design. The Townsville General Hospital designed between 1935-39 (built 1951), the Kingaroy General Hospital and Nurses' Quarters (1936‚Äì38), Goondiwindi Hospital 1939, Roma Hospital 1940, Nurses' Quarters Nambour 1941-42 (demolished 1999) were all buildings designed in this period. After the Second World War the partnership of Donoghue and Fulton was dissolved and Fulton took a new partner James Musgrave Collin. During this period Charles Fulton designed a number of notable hospital buildings including, Barcaldine Hospital main block and Staff Quarters (1953), Clermont Hospital main block (1955), Aramac nurses quarters (1957). All these later buildings were characterised by low pitched roofs, linear planning, cross ventilation, wide eaves or awnings and the use of modern materials. The firm that he founded continues as Fulton Trotter. The Fulton family occupied the Fulton Residence for nearly 60 years with Charles Fulton dying in 1988 and his wife Violet Edna Fulton in 1999. Both Mr and Mrs Fulton were very attached to the house and garden and it remained virtually unaltered from when it was completed in 1940.  Description  Driveway in McCaul Street, 2014 The Fulton House is a modified example of the International style in the materials, detailing and asymmetrical massing. It is a two-storey buff-coloured brick house with contrasting red brick to the lower levels and a terra cotta tiled roof. A large box gutter is concealed behind a deep fascia board and this combined with the horizontal raked joints and the concrete balcony and steel balustrade serves to emphasise the horizontal lines. The chimney is built in a red brick emphasising the vertical line. Internally the house is designed on three levels with an entrance stair hall leading down to an open planned living dining room opening onto a small kitchen. The open stairwell leads to the upper level which contains two bedrooms, a study and a bathroom The main bedroom and study open onto the balcony. Internally the house is without decoration and is flooded with light from the large windows. The house is very intact and has many of the original light fittings and \\"modern\\" features such as built-in cupboards in the kitchen and bedrooms. Bookshelves in the living room and bed head units in the bedrooms were designed and built by Charles Fulton. The house is set back on the site overlooking Indooroopilly Road with a large mature garden in front of the house. The garden has a stone flagged terrace, stone retaining walls and stepped garden terraces all of which were constructed by Charles Fulton and his family.  Heritage listing  Fulton Residence was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The house demonstrates how, in the interwar period, European architectural ideas were transferred to Australia and modified to local conditions. The Fulton Residence is an important building in the evolution of domestic architecture in Queensland. In the immediate post war period the western Brisbane suburbs of St Lucia, Taringa and Indooroopilly were the location of many experiments with modern domestic architecture and the Fulton Residence is part of this tradition. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Fulton Residence is an excellent intact Queensland example of the international style of architecture, with its use of modern materials, and the asymmetrical balance of horizontal and vertical elements. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The design of the building with its interplay of horizontal and vertical elements and curved balcony has aesthetic value. Sited on a slope the house is enhanced by a large mature garden which contributes to the ambience of the surrounding suburb. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Fulton Residence is intimately associated with the esteemed architect Charles Fulton as the house he designed for his family. It displays many of the characteristics of his work including the use of face brickwork, the use of modern materials such as steel windows and stainless, corner windows, the eschewing of internal decoration and an interest in designing for a sub tropical climate. Charles Fulton is an important figure in the development of architecture in Queensland both as an educator and a practitioner. He played an important role at the Brisbane Central Technical College (now the Queensland University of Technology) for over thirty years. He was one of the main architects responsible for introducing the international style to Queensland. He experimented with this style combining it with an interest in climatic design. Aside from his own home his key buildings include the Masel residence at Stanthorpe, Nudgee Junior College Indooroopilly, Kingaroy General Hospital, Barcaldine Hospital and Townsville Hospital.

The scheme results in a wider bandwidth and steeper skirts than a single tuned circuit would achieve. There is a critical value of transformer coupling coefficient at which the frequency response of the amplifier is maximally flat in the passband and the gain is maximum at the resonant frequency. Designs frequently use a coupling greater than this (over-coupling) in order to achieve an even wider bandwidth at the expense of a small loss of gain in the centre of the passband. Cascading multiple stages of double-tuned amplifiers results in a reduction of the bandwidth of the overall amplifier. Two stages of double-tuned amplifier have 80% of the bandwidth of a single stage. An alternative to double tuning that avoids this loss of bandwidth is staggered tuning. Stagger-tuned amplifiers can be designed to a prescribed bandwidth that is greater than the bandwidth of any single stage. However, staggered tuning requires more stages and has lower gain than double tuning.  Typical circuit  A typical 2-stage double-tuned amplifier The circuit shown consists of two stages of amplifier in common emitter topology. The bias resistors all serve their usual functions. The input of the first stage is coupled in the conventional way with a series capacitor to avoid affecting the bias. However, the collector load consists of a transformer which serves as the inter-stage coupling instead of capacitors. The windings of the transformer have inductance. Capacitors placed across the transformer windings form resonant circuits which provide the tuning of the amplifier. A further detail that may be seen in this kind of amplifier is the presence of taps on the transformer windings. These are used for the input and output connections of the transformer rather than the top of the windings. This is done for impedance matching purposes; bipolar junction transistor amplifiers (the kind shown in the circuit) have a quite high output impedance and a quite low input impedance. This problem can be avoided by using MOSFETs which have a very high input impedance.Bhargava et al., pp. 382‚Äì383 The capacitors connected between the bottom of the transformer secondary windings and ground do not form part of the tuning. Rather, their purpose is to decouple the transistor bias resistors from the AC circuit.  Properties  Double tuning, as compared to single tuning, has the effect of widening the bandwidth of the amplifier and steepening the skirt of the response.Gulati, p. 432 Tuning both sides of the transformer forms a pair of coupled resonators which is the source of the increased bandwidth. The gain of the amplifier is a function of the coupling coefficient, k, which is related to the mutual inductance, M, and the primary and secondary winding inductances, Lp and Ls respectively, by : M = k \\\\sqrt {L_\\\\mathrm p L_\\\\mathrm s} There is a critical value of coupling at which the gain of the amplifier is a maximum at resonance. Below this critical value, there is a single peak in the frequency response with the amplitude peaking at resonance and the peak decreasing as k decreases. Such a response is said to be undercoupled, At values of k above critical coupling the response starts to split into two peaks. These peaks become narrower and further apart as k increases and the gap between them (centred on the resonant frequency) becomes progressively deeper. Such a response is said to be overcoupled. A critically coupled amplifier has a response that is maximally flat. This response can also be achieved without transformers with two stages of a stagger-tuned amplifier. Unlike staggered tuning, double tuning usually tunes both resonators to the same resonant frequency.Chattopadhyay, p. 196 However, a designer might choose to design an overcoupled amplifier in order to achieve a wider bandwidth at the expense of a small dip (typically to maximize the bandwidth) in the centre of the frequency response.Bakshi & Godse, p. 5.26 Like synchronous tuning, adding more stages of double-tuned amplifiers has the effect of reducing the bandwidth. The bandwidth of n identical stages, as a fraction of the bandwidth of a single stage, is given approximately by, : \\\\sqrt[4] {2^{1/n} - 1} This expression applies only to small fractional bandwidths.Bakshi & Godse, p. 5.29  Analysis  The circuit can be represented in a more generic way by replacing the amplifiers with a generalised transconductance amplifier as shown. Generic representation of one stage of a double-tuned amplifier and part of the following stage :where (omitting the stage number suffixes), :Go is the output conductance of the amplifiers :Gi is the input conductance of the amplifiers. Typically, a design will make the resonant frequencies and Qs on the primary and secondary sides identical, such that, : \\\\omega_0 = \\\\omega_{0 \\\\mathrm p} = {1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt {L_\\\\mathrm p C_\\\\mathrm p}} = \\\\omega_{0 \\\\mathrm s} = {1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{L_\\\\mathrm s C_\\\\mathrm s}} :and, : Q = Q_\\\\mathrm p = {1 \\\\over L_\\\\mathrm p G_ \\\\mathrm o} = Q_\\\\mathrm s = {1 \\\\over L_\\\\mathrm s G_ \\\\mathrm i} :where œâ0 is the resonant frequency expressed in units of angular frequency and the subscripts p and s refer respectively to components on the primary and secondary side of the transformer. = Stage gain = Double-tuned amplifier frequency response for various values of coupling With the above assumptions, the voltage gain, A of one stage of the amplifier can be expressed as : A = A_0 \\\\frac {2kQ}{4Q \\\\delta - i(1 + k^2 Q^2 - 4 Q^2 \\\\delta^2)} :where :i is the imaginary unit, :A_0 = \\\\frac {g_\\\\mathrm m} { 2 \\\\sqrt {G_\\\\mathrm o G_\\\\mathrm i}} :is the maximum gain deliverable by the stage, and : \\\\delta = \\\\frac {\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0} {\\\\omega_0} :is the frequency expressed as the fractional frequency deviation from the resonant frequency. = Peak frequency = With less than critical coupling, there is one peak in the response occurring at resonance. Above critical coupling, there are two peaks at frequencies given by : \\\\delta_\\\\mathrm H, \\\\delta_\\\\mathrm L = \\\\pm {1 \\\\over 2Q} \\\\sqrt {k^2 Q^2 - 1} :where Œ¥L and Œ¥H are respectively the low and high frequencies of the peaks expressed as fractional deviation. With critical coupling or above, the peaks reach the maximum gain available from the amplifier. = Critical coupling = Critical coupling occurs when the two peaks just coincide. That is, when : k^2 Q^2 - 1 = 0 or : k = {1 \\\\over Q} Bakshi & Godse, pp. 5.20‚Äì5.26 (for entire analysis section)  References  Bibliography * Bakshi, Uday A.; Godse, Atul P., Electronic Circuit Analysis, Technical Publications, 2009 . * Bhargava, N.

The Admiralty ordered her construction towards the end of May 1794 and work began the following month at Northfleet dockyard. She was completed on 12 October 1795 and joined Admiral John Jervis's fleet in the Mediterranean. In 1797, Emerald was one of several vessels sent to hunt down and capture the crippled Santisima Trinidad, which had escaped from the British at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Emerald was supposed to have been present at the Battle of the Nile but in May 1798 a storm separated her from Horatio Nelson's squadron and she arrived in Aboukir Bay nine days too late. She was part of Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth's squadron during the action of 7 April 1800 off C√°diz. Emerald served in the Caribbean throughout 1803 in Samuel Hood's fleet, then took part in the invasion of St Lucia in July, and of Surinam the following spring. Returning to home waters for repairs in 1806, she served in the Western Approaches before joining a fleet under Admiral James Gambier in 1809, and taking part in the Battle of the Basque Roads. In November 1811 she sailed to Portsmouth where she was laid up in ordinary. Fitted out as a receiving ship in 1822, she was eventually broken up in January 1836.  Construction  Emerald was a 36-gun, 18-pound, Amazon- class frigate built to William Rule's design.Winfield p. 148 She and her sister ship, , were ordered on 24 May 1794 and were built to the same dimensions: along the gun deck, at the keel, with a beam of and a depth in the hold of . They measured 933 tons burthen. Emerald was completed at Thomas Pitcher's dockyard in Northfleet at a cost of ¬£14,419 and launched on 31 July 1795, twenty-seven days after Amazon. Her coppering at Woolwich was finished on 12 October 1795, and she was fitted-out at a further cost of ¬£9,390. The Admiralty ordered a second pair of Amazon-class ships on 24 January 1795. They were marginally smaller at 925 tons (bm) and were built from pitch pine.  Service  = Mediterranean = Santisima Trinidad being rescued at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Emerald was one of the British frigates sent out to track her down afterwards. Emerald was first commissioned in August 1795, under Captain Velters Cornewall Berkeley and in January 1797, she sailed for the Mediterranean. Spain had become allied to France and declared war on Britain in October 1796. Early in 1797, a Spanish fleet of 27 ships of the line was at Cartagena with orders to join the French fleet at Brest. A storm blew the Spanish fleet off course, enabling Admiral John Jervis's fleet of 15 ships of the line to intercept it off Cape St Vincent on 14 February.Willis pp. 89‚Äì90 Although attached to Jervis' fleet at the time, as a frigate Emerald was too lightly built to take part in the Battle of Cape St Vincent; instead she anchored in nearby Lagos Bay with other vessels. On 16 February, the victorious British fleet and its prizes entered the bay. Jervis ordered the three frigates‚ÄîEmerald, and , of 40 and 32 guns, respectively‚Äîto search for the disabled flagship, Santisima Trinidad, which had been towed from the battle. Two smaller craft‚ÄîBonne-Citoyenne, a corvette of 20 guns, and the 14-gun sloop ‚Äîjoined the frigates. The British squadron on 20 February sighted Santisima Trinidad under tow by a large frigate and in the company of a brig. Berkeley, considering the small squadron under his command insufficient, declined to engage and eventually the Spanish ships sailed from sight. The 32-gun , while cruising alone, later located Santisima Trinidad and engaged her but the out-gunned British frigate was forced to abandon her attack.James (Vol. II) p. 49  Action of 26 April 1797  Following the Battle of Cape St Vincent, the British pursued the remainder of the Spanish fleet to C√°diz, where Jervis began a long-running blockade of the port.Dull pp. 147‚Äì148 On 26 April, while cruising in the company of the 74-gun , Emerald helped to capture a 34-gun Spanish ship and to destroy another. The Spanish vessels were close to the coast when Jervis's fleet sighted them. Sent to investigate, Emerald and Irresistible, under Captain George Martin, discovered the ships were the frigates and Clowes (Vol. IV) p. 507‚Äîthe Spanish ships had been carrying silver from Havana to C√°diz, but had transferred their cargo the previous night to a fishing boat that had warned them of the proximity of the British fleet.Woodman p. 99 The Spanish ships sought shelter from the British north of Trafalgar in Conil Bay, the entrance to which was protected by a large rocky ledge. Irresistible and Emerald negotiated this obstacle at around 14:30 and engaged the Spanish ships, which were anchored in the Bay.James (Vol. II) p. 82 The Spanish ships surrendered at approximately 16:00. Eighteen Spaniards were killed and 30 wounded during the fighting; one Briton was killed and one wounded. The remaining crew of Santa Elena avoided capture by cutting her cables and drifting her on shore so they could flee on foot. The British managed to drag Santa Elena off the beach but, badly damaged, she sank at sea. The British took Ninfa into service as HMS Hamadryad, a 36-gun frigate with a main battery of 12-pounders,James (Vol. II) p. 83 but were unable to retrieve the cargo of silver, which later arrived safely in C√°diz.  Second bombardment of C√°diz  Captain Thomas Waller took command of Emerald in mid-1797, and was stationed with Admiral Jervis's fleet off C√°diz. On 3July, Jervis attempted to end the protracted blockade by ordering a bombardment of the town. A first attempt resulted in the capture of two Spanish mortar boats but achieved little else.James (Vol. II) pp. 53‚Äì54 During a second bombardment on the night of 5July, Emerald, in the company of Terpsichore and the 74-gun , provided a protective escort for three bomb vessels, , and . This attack caused considerable damage; the next morning, the Spanish hurriedly moved ten of their line-of-battle ships out of range.James (Vol. II) p. 54 The British cancelled a third bombardment, planned for 8July, when the weather became unfavourable.  Attack on Santa Cruz  The British attack on Santa Cruz de Tenerife, painted in 1848 by Francisco de Aguilar Later in July 1797, Emerald took part in an unsuccessful attack on Santa Cruz. A planned attack in April, proposed by Admiral Nelson, had been aborted as the troops required to execute it were unavailable. When Jervis was subsequently advised that the Spanish treasure fleet was anchored there, he revived Nelson's idea.Heathcote p. 181 For the new attack, Nelson was to take three ships of the line, three frigates, including Emerald, and 200 marines, for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold. The frigates would then engage the batteries to the north-east of Santa Cruz while the marines stormed the town. However, a combination of strong currents and heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack. Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July; although the British were able to land troops, Spanish resistance was too strong and the British had to ask for an honourable withdrawal.Heathcote p. 182 After the attack, Nelson sent Emerald with his report to Jervis, who in turn sent her on to England with dispatches. Waller arrived at the Admiralty on 1September, with the news of the failed attacks.  Alexandria  While serving with Jervis on the Lisbon station in December 1797, Emerald, under the temporary command of Lord William Proby, captured the 8-gun privateer, Chasseur Basque. Waller returned as captain in April 1798. In May, Jervis dispatched a squadron of five ships, including Emerald and commanded by Nelson in the 74-gun , to locate a large invasion fleet that had left Toulon.James (Vol. II) p. 148 After receiving intelligence on 22 May, Nelson correctly predicted the French fleet's destination and set course for AlexandriaJames (Vol. II) p. 154 where the British captured or destroyed all but two of the French ships at the Battle of the Nile, which occurred between 1‚Äì3 August 1798.Willis p. 168 Emerald missed the battle; having previously become separated from the rest of the squadron in a storm on 21 May, she arrived at Aboukir Bay on 12 August.James (Vol. II) p. 183 When Nelson left for Naples on 19 August 1798, he left behind a squadron‚Äîcomprising three 74s , , , three frigates Emerald, and , and the corvette Bonne Citoyenne‚Äîunder Samuel Hood to patrol the waters around the port and along the coast.Clowes (Vol. IV) p. 373 On 2September, it encountered and destroyed the French aviso An√©mone. Emerald and Seahorse chased Anemone inshore, where she anchored in shallow water out of their reach. When they launched their boats to cut-out Anƒómone, her crew cut the anchor cable and their ship drifted on to the shore; as the Frenchmen were attempting to escape along the coast, hostile Arabs captured them and stripped them of their clothes, shooting those who resisted. A heavy surf prevented the British boats from landing, so a midshipman from Emerald, the young Francis Fane, swam ashore with a line and empty cask to rescue the commander and seven others who had escaped naked to the beach.James (Vol. II) pp. 192‚Äì193 Anƒómone had a crew of 60 men under the command of Enseigne de Vaisseau (Ensign) Garibou,Fonds Marine, p. 210. and was also carrying General Camin and Citoyen Valette, aide-de-camp to General Napoleon Bonaparte, with dispatches from Toulon. Camin and Valette were among those the Arabs killed. Emerald remained stationed off Alexandria for the rest of the year.  Action on 18 June 1799  Emerald and Minerve, while cruising together on 2June, took Caroline, a 16-gun French privateer, off the south-east coast of Sardinia. Later, Emerald assisted in the capture of , , , Salamine and in the action of 18 June 1799. The British fleet under George Elphinstone was some 69 miles off Cape Sici√© when three French frigates and two brigs were spotted. Elphinstone engaged them with three seventy-fours, , and , and two frigates, Emerald and .James (Vol. II) p. 262 The next evening, after a 28-hour chase, the French ships were forced into an action. The French squadron had scattered, enabling the British to attack it piecemeal. Bellona fired the first shots at 19:00 as she, Captain, and the two frigates closed with Junon and Alceste, both of which struck their colours immediately. Bellona then joined Centaur in chasing Courageuse. Faced with overwhelming odds, Courageuse also surrendered. Emerald then overhauled Salamine, and Captain took Alerte at around 23:30.Troude (1867), Vol. III, p. 164.  Action on 7 April 1800  Rear-Admiral John Duckworth, commander of the squadron blockading C√°diz, of which Emerald was a part when she fought in the action of 7 April 1800 Emerald returned to blockade duty at C√°diz in April 1800, joining a squadron under Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth that included the 74-gun ships and Swiftsure, and the fire ship . The squadron sighted a Spanish convoy on 5April, which comprised 13 merchant vessels and three accompanying frigates, and at once gave chase.James (Vol. III) p. 37 At 03:00 the following day, Emerald managed to overhaul and cross the bow of a 10-gun merchantman, which, having nowhere to go, immediately surrendered. By daybreak, the remainder of the Spanish convoy had scattered and the only ship visible was a 14-gun brig, Los Anglese. The absence of wind prevented the becalmed British vessels approaching her. Instead, Leviathan and Emerald lowered boats that rowed towards the brig, which they captured after a short exchange of fire. Other sails were now spotted in the east, west and south, forcing the British to divide their force: Swiftsure went south, Emerald east, and Leviathan west. At midday, Emerald signalled that there were six vessels to the north-east, and Leviathan wore round to pursue. By dusk, the two British ships had nine Spanish craft in sight. Three ships were seen at midnight to the north-north- west, and by 02:00 the following morning, two had been identified as the enemy frigates and .James (Vol. III) pp. 37‚Äì38 Duckworth ordered Emerald to take a parallel course to the enemy frigates in anticipation of a dawn attack, and at first light, the British closed with their opponents. The Spaniards had assumed the approaching vessels were part of their convoy, but by daybreak they had realised their error and vainly set more sail to escape. Being close enough to hail the Spanish crews, Duckworth ordered them to surrender. When the Spaniards ignored the demand, he ordered Leviathan and Emerald to open fire on the rigging of the Spanish vessels in order to disable them. Both Spanish frigates quickly surrendered.James (Vol. III) p. 38 Carmen had had 11 men killed and 16 wounded; Florentina 12 killed and 10 wounded, including her first and second captains. The two Spanish frigates were each carrying 1,500 quintals of mercury. A third frigate was visible on the horizon. Emerald immediately set off in pursuit but Duckworth recalled her and instead ordered her to locate the merchant ships; she secured four of the largest vessels by nightfall. The need to make the two captured frigates ready to sail delayed Leviathan, and by the time this was completed the third frigate had made her escape. Leviathan then returned to rendezvous with Emerald, managing to take a further enemy brig before night fell. The following day, both British vessels sailed for Gibraltar with their prizes. On arrival, they encountered Incendiary, which had made port the previous day with two captured vessels of its own. The small British squadron managed to secure nine merchant vessels and two frigates in total. = Caribbean = 1798 map showing the Dutch colonies of Essequibo and Demarara Britain declared war on France in May 1803 following the short-lived Peace of Amiens and by June, Emerald, under the command of Captain James O'Bryen, had joined Samuel Hood's squadron in the Leeward Islands. Prior to the British invasion of St Lucia on 21 June, she harassed enemy shipping, disrupting the island's resupply. The invasion force left Barbados on 20 June. It comprised Hood's 74-gun flagship , the 74-gun , the frigates and Chichester, and the sloops and . The following morning, Emerald and the 18-gun sloop had joined them. By 11:00, the squadron was anchored in Choc Bay.Clowes (Vol. V) p. 56 The troops were landed by 17:00 and half an hour later the town of Castries was in British hands. In the island's main fortress, Morne-Fortun√©e, the French troops refused to surrender; the British stormed it at 04:00 on 22 June, and by 04:30 St Lucia was in British hands. Following this easy victory, the British sent a force to Tobago, which capitulated on 1July.James (Vol. III) p. 207 Emerald was between St Lucia and Martinique on 24 June, when she captured the 16-gun French privateer Enfant Prodigue after a 72-hour chase. The French vessel was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Victor Lefbru and was carrying dispatches for Martinique. The Royal Navy took Enfant Prodigue into service as HMS St Lucia.Winfield p. 348 While in the company of the 22-gun brig , Emerald intercepted and captured a Dutch merchant vessel travelling between Surinam and Amsterdam on 10 August. On 5September, she captured two French schooners, and later that month took part in attacks on Berbice, Essequibo and Demarara.  Fort Diamond  Emeralds first lieutenant, Thomas Forest, commanded the 6-gun cutter on 13 March 1804 when, with 30 of Emeralds crew aboard, she captured a French privateer off Saint-Pierre, Martinique. Contrary winds prevented the privateer, Mosambique, from entering St Pierre and she had sought shelter beneath the batteries at Seron.James (Vol. III) p. 253 Because Emerald was too far downwind, Captain O'Bryen used boats and crew from Emerald to create a diversion and draw fire from the battery while Fort Diamond approached from the opposite direction, rounded Pearl Rock (some two miles off the coast), and bore down on Mosambique. Forest put the cutter alongside with such force that a chain securing the privateer to the shore snapped. The 60-man French crew abandoned their vessel and swam ashore. The Royal Navy took into service.Winfield p. 364  Capture of Surinam  1773 map of the Dutch colony of Surinam showing the respective positions of the Surinam and Commewine rivers, Warapee Creek, Braam's point, and the forts Leyden and New Amsterdam In the spring of 1804, Emerald and her crew took part in an invasion of Surinam. The invasion force consisted of Hood's flagship , Emerald, the 44-gun heavy frigates Pandour and , the 28-gun sixth-rate , the 12-gun schooner , the 12-gun corvette , and the 8-gun Drake, together with 2,000 troops under Brigadier-General Sir Charles Green. The force arrived from Barbados on 25 April after a twenty-two-day journey.James (Vol III) pp. 288‚Äì289 The sloop Hippomenes, a transport and a further three armed vessels, landed Brigadier-General Frederick Maitland and 700 troops at Warapee Creek on the night of 30 April. The following night, O'Bryen was ordered to assist Brigadier-General Hughes in the taking of Braam's Point. A sandbar initially prevented Emerald from entering the Surinam River but O'Bryen forced her across on the rising tide, with Pandour and Drake following. Anchoring close by, the three British ships quickly put the Dutch battery of 18-pounders out of action and captured the fort without loss of life.James (Vol. III) p. 289 Emerald, Pandour, and Drake then pushed up the river, sometimes in less water than the frigates required to float properly, until on 5May they arrived close to the forts Leyden and Frederici. The British landed a detachment of troops under Hughes some distance away, which marching under the cover of the forests and swamps, launched an attack that resulted in the swift capture of the two forts.James (Vol. III) pp. 289‚Äì290 By this time, most of the squadron had managed to work its way up the river as far as Frederici, Maitland was advancing along the Commewine River, and with troops poised to attack the fort of New Amsterdam, the Batavian commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Batenburg, duly surrendered.James (Vol. III) p. 290 Emerald captured the vessel Augusta, which was under American colours, on 22 August and sent her into Antigua with the cargo of wine that she had been carrying from Leghorn to Guadeloupe.Lloyd's List n¬∞ 4506. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016. Emerald left Tortola on 26 October as escort to a convoy of 50 vessels for England but having parted from them in a storm, she put into Madeira in distress on 11 December.Lloyd's List n¬∞ 4513. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016.Lloyd's List n¬∞ 4185. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016. = Service on the Home Station = Between February and June 1806, Emerald underwent repairs at Deptford dockyard and was recommissioned under Captain John Armour; Frederick Lewis Maitland assumed command in the first quarter of 1807. While in the Basque Roads in April, Emerald captured the 14-gun privateer Austerlitz, a brig from Nantes under the command of Captain Gatien Lafont.Demerliac (2004), n¬∞ 2190, p. 278. Emerald, while escorting a Spanish polacca that she had taken, spotted and captured the privateer on 14 April after a ten-hour chase. Austerlitz had been out of port two days but had made no captures; the polacca was the Spanish ship Prince of Asturias, which had sailed from La Guayra with a cargo of cocoa, bark and indigo. Emerald sent both prizes into Plymouth, where they arrived on 22 April. Emerald herself set off in pursuit of another vessel from La Guayra.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4146 ‚Äì accessed 11 November 2015. Emerald recaptured Zulema which had been plundered and taken by a French privateer as she sailed from Philadelphia to Liverpool. She arrived in Plymouth under her master, Mr Howard, on 4May.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4150. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016. During December, Plymouth received more of Emerald captures. At the beginning of the month, Young Elias was detained. Her master Monsieur Delance, had been sailing from Philadelphia to Bordeaux.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4210. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016. On 26 December, Mr Seaton's vessel, Friendship was caught returning from France.Lloyd's List n¬∞4215, ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016.  Apropos  Emeralds boats participated in a cutting-out expedition in Viveiro harbour on 13 March 1808. While cruising inshore at around 17:00, Emerald spotted a large French schooner, Apropos, of 250 tons (bm), anchored in the bay. Apropos was armed with twelve 8-pounder guns, though pierced for 16, and had a crew of more than 70 men under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Lagary. The crews of the schooner and of the two batteries guarding the harbour had seen Emerald but Maitland still made plans to attack Apropos. He soon discovered it was not possible to place Emerald so as to engage both enemy batteries simultaneously, and instead sent landing parties to silence the guns, which had been firing on his ship since 17:30. The first landing party, led by Lieutenant Bertram and accompanied by two marine lieutenants and two master mates, stormed the outer fort. Maitland then positioned Emerald close to the second battery while a boat under the command of his third lieutenant, Smith, landed about a mile along the shore. This second landing party encountered Spanish soldiers, but drove them off and pursued them inland. By the time Smith's party returned to the beach, Emerald had already silenced the battery. In the darkness, Smith subsequently failed to locate the fort. The crew of Apropos had run her ashore soon after Emerald had entered the harbour. The harbour batteries having been destroyed, Captain Maitland sent a further force under Midshipman Baird to secure and refloat the French ship. The original landing party under Lieutenant Bertram, which had already encountered and dispersed 60 members of the schooner's crew, met Baird's party on the beach. The British made several unsuccessful attempts to re-float the schooner before being forced to set her afire and depart. British casualties were heavy. Emerald had nine men killed, and 16 wounded, including Lieutenant Bertram. Maitland estimated that French casualties too had been heavy. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the clasp \\"Emerald 13 March 1808\\" to the Naval General Service Medal to the ten surviving claimants from the action.  Back in the Basque Roads  British chart of the Basque Roads, 1757 A French schooner Amadea arrived in Plymouth on 15 December 1808 having previously been captured and sent in by Emerald.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4302. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016. Back in the Basque Roads on 23 February 1809, Emerald was this time part of a squadron under Robert Stopford. Stopford's flagship, the 80-gun , was also accompanied by the seventy-fours and , and the 36-gun frigates and . At 20:00, Stopford's squadron was anchored off the Chassiron Lighthouse, to the north-west of Ile d'Ol√©ron, when the sighting of several rockets prompted him to investigate. About an hour later, sails were seen to the east which the British followed until daylight the following morning. The sails belonged to a French squadron that Stopford deduced to be out of Brest and which heaved to in the Pertuis d'Antioche. The French force comprised eight ships of the line and two frigates, and Stopford immediately sent Naiad to apprise Admiral James Gambier of the situation. Naiad had not gone too far however when she signalled that there were three other vessels to the north-west. Stopford ordered Amethyst and Emerald to remain while he and the rest of the squadron set off in pursuit. The British frigate and the sloop also joined the chase. Caesar, Donegal, Defiance, and Amelia eventually drove the three French frigates ashore and destroyed them. Emerald and Amethyst had more success in the spring of 1809 when on 23 March they captured the brigs Caroline and Serpent. In April, Emerald assisted Amethyst in the chase of a large 44-gun frigate off Ushant. Emerald sighted , with a main battery of 18-pounders and under the command of Captain Dupoter, at 11:00 on 5April and immediately signalled Amethyst for assistance. Amethyst caught a glimpse of the French forty-four just as she turned away to the south-east and gave chase but by 19:20 had lost sight of both Niemen and Emerald. Amethyst fell in with Niemen again at around 21:30 and engaged her. Niemen was forced to strike when a second British frigate, came into view and fired a broadside. The Royal Navy took Niemen into service under her existing name.Winfield p. 178 On 26 March, Enfant de Patria arrived at Plymouth. Patria, of 500 tons (bm), 10 guns, and 60 men, had sailed from France for √éle de France when Emerald and Amethyst captured her.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4340. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016. Two days later Emerald captured a second letter of marque, the 4-gun Aventurier, bound for the relief of Guadeloupe. She had a crew of 30 men.  Battle of the Basque Roads  Map illustrating the position of the anchored French fleet shortly before the British attack on the night of 11 April Emerald was part of the fleet under Admiral Lord Gambier that fought the Battle of the Basque Roads in April 1809. The French ships were anchored under the protection of the powerful batteries on the Isle d'AixJames (Vol. V) pp. 103‚Äì104 when on 11 April Lord Cochrane attacked them with fireships and explosive vessels.James (Vol. V) p. 105 Emerald provided a diversion to the east of the island with the brigs , , , and Growler. The fireships met with only partial success; the French, having anticipated such an attack, had rigged a boom across the channel.James (Vol. V) p. 104 One of the explosive vessels breached the boom, leading the French to cut their cables and drift on to the shoals.James (Vol. V) pp. 108‚Äì109 The following day, after much delay, Gambier ordered a battle squadron to reinforce Cochrane in the Basque Roads. The British ships anchored, with springs, in a crescent around some of the stranded French ships, and exchanged fire. Emerald took up position ahead of Indefatigable and behind Aigle and Unicorn, and directed her fire mainly towards the French ships of the line, Varsovie and Aquilon, both of which struck at around 17:30.James (Vol. V) p. 114. At 20:00, Emerald, along with the other British frigates and brigs, weighed and anchored with the 74-gun in the Maumusson passage to the south of Ol√©ron while a second fireship attack was under preparation.James (Vol. V) pp. 116‚Äì117 Although the fireships were ready in the early hours on the 13th, contrary winds prevented their deployment. The British instead set Varsovie and Aquilon alight just after 03:00, on the orders of Captain John Bligh, after removing their crews.James (Vol. V) p. 117. Emerald, and the other vessels moored with her, were recalled at 05:00 but owing to the lack of water, only the brigs were able to pass further up the river.James (Vol. V) pp. 118‚Äì119. Emerald therefore took no further part in the attack, which continued until 29 April when the last French ship was able to free herself from the mud and escape up the river to Rochefort.James (Vol. V) p. 122. = Later service = Emerald took two French sloops in July 1809. Deux Freres, en route for Guadeloupe from Rochelle when captured, arrived in Plymouth on 26 July.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4375. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016. A week later, Emerald captured the French schooner Balance, which had been sailing to France from Guadeloupe.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4376. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016. Both captures carried letters of marque, a government licence authorising the attack and capture of enemy vessels. The first, of four guns, was carrying a small reinforcement for Guadeloupe's garrison. The second, also of four guns, was carrying a cargo of coffee and other colonial produce. While off the coast of Ireland on 8October, Emerald rescued a British brig by capturing Incomparable, an 8-gun French privateer. The Frenchman was about to take the British vessel when Emerald intervened. Incomparable had a crew of 63 men and was four days out of Saint-Malo, but had not yet captured any other vessel. Still in Irish waters on 6November, Emerald took the 16-gun French brig , two days out of Brest and bound for Guadeloupe. After an all-night chase, Emerald caught up. Capitaine de fregate Croquet Deschateurs of Fanfaron resisted, firing several broadsides and a final double-shotted broadside. Unable to escape, Deschateurs prepared to board but Emerald evaded the manoeuvre and fired a broadside that dismasted Fanfaron, leaving Deschateurs no option but to surrender his vessel. The subsequent French court-martial not only absolved Deschateurs of any liability for the loss but also commended him for his conduct.Troude (1867), Vol. IV, pp. 74‚Äì77. Four days later Emerald arrived at Cork with Fanfaron and Luna. Fanfaron, with a crew of 113, had been carrying a cargo of flour, salt and other provisions, as well as iron, lead and nails, all for Guadeloupe.European Magazine and London Review, Vol. 56, p. 469. At the beginning of February 1810, Emerald captured and sent into Plymouth, Commerce, Hanson, master, which had been sailing from Drontheim to Bordeaux.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4432. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016. Then on 22 March, Emerald captured the 350-ton (bm) Belle Etoile in the Bay of Biscay. Caught after a twelve-hour chase during which she jettisoned much of her cargo; Belle Etoile, out of Bayonne, was pierced for 20 guns but only carried eight. Carrying a cargo of wine, flour, oil, and other merchandise to √éle de France, she was sent into Cork with her 56-man crew.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4446. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016. Emerald captured an American ship, Wasp, in July 1810. Wasp was carrying 91 passengers from New York to Bordeaux; they arrived at Plymouth on 30 July.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4481. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016. Emerald was still serving on the Home Station on 11 April 1811 when she sent into Cork a French privateer.Lloyd's List, n¬∞ 4554. ‚Äì accessed 12 July 2016. This was the 18-gun (or Augusta), which had been taken on 6 April. Nearly a month later, on 5July, Emerald left Madeira in the company of five East Indiamen and was still on convoy duties later that month when a transport ship spotted her escorting thirteen vessels off the coast of West Africa on 18 July.  Fate  In November 1811, Emerald sailed to Portsmouth and was laid up in ordinary. Fitted out as a receiving ship in 1822, she was eventually broken up in January 1836.

A number of his works are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Early life Charles Fulton was born in Sydney in 1906 and received his architectural training as an articled pupil of FE Stowe, architect and civil engineer. In 1931-32 he worked in London as a draftsman for Rudder and Grout and then B George Architects. During this period he travelled in Europe and made pilgrimages looking at buildings. He was particularly interested in the work of Dutch architect Willem Dudok, whose Hilversum Town Hall was influential in Britain in the early thirties. Career In 1933 Charles Fulton returned to Australia and settled in Brisbane where he was employed by Hall and Cook. In 1937 he entered into partnership with John Patrick Donoghue. In the same year he also became lecturer in charge of Architecture at the Brisbane Central Technical College and he taught in the architecture school for 33 years. He made a large contribution to architectural education throughout his whole career and the Queensland University of Technology named its architecture facility the \\"Charles Fulton School of Architecture\\" in his honour. Charles Fulton was a key practitioner and teacher of the modern trends in architectural design in Queensland during the late thirties and forties. The Masel Residence at Stanthorpe (1938), Nudgee Junior College Indooroopilly (1938) and his own residence all received meritorious architecture awards in the early Royal Australian Institute of Architects Queensland Awards Programs. Aside from their domestic work the practice of Donoghue and Fulton was renowned as hospital architects who combined the latest ideas in hospital planning with recent developments in architectural design. The Townsville General Hospital designed between 1935-39 (built 1951), the Kingaroy General Hospital and Nurses' Quarters (1936‚Äì38), Goondiwindi Hospital 1939, Roma Hospital 1940, Nurses' Quarters Nambour 1941-42 (demolished 1999) were all buildings designed in this period. After the Second World War the partnership of Donoghue and Fulton was dissolved and Fulton took a new partner James Musgrave Collin. During this period Charles Fulton designed a number of notable hospital buildings including, Barcaldine Hospital main block and Staff Quarters (1953), Clermont Hospital main block (1955), Aramac nurses quarters (1957). All these later buildings were characterised by low pitched roofs, linear planning, cross ventilation, wide eaves or awnings and the use of modern materials. The firm that he founded continues as Fulton Trotter. Later life Charles Fulton's residence, 1944 The Fulton family occupied the Fulton Residence for nearly 60 years with Charles Fulton dying in 1988 and his wife Violet Edna Fulton in 1999. Both Mr and Mrs Fulton were very attached to the house and garden and it remained virtually unaltered from when it was completed in 1940.

Cahn and written by Earl Felton and Harry Ruskin. The film stars Bruce Cabot, Virginia Grey, Edward Norris, Jean Chatburn and Cliff Edwards. The film was released on August 27, 1937, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot A power linesman by trade, Lucky Walden (Bruce Cabot) owes gambling debts, plus interest, to crooked gamblers. When they come to make him pay, Lucky hits one with a wrench, killing him. He goes to jail and is sentenced to death. Lucky's one chance is for his brother Steve (Edward Norris) to find an eyewitness who can testify that Lucky killed the man in self-defense. When the man is found and corroborates that story, Lucky gets a stay of execution. He then earns a full parole by risking his own life in saving a fellow inmate from some dangerous high-voltage wires. Lucky goes back to his old tricks.

With 95 dead and 150 wounded people, it is the worst train accident so far in the country. Accident At 22:45 hours local time on October 20, 1957, two passenger trains collided head-on on the single railway line at west of ƒ∞stanbul Sirkeci Terminal between the railway stations Yarƒ±mburgaz and Ispartakule. The east-bound motor train with the train number 3, composed of three diesel multiple unit (DMU) cars, departed from Edirne railway station at 16:00 hours local time heading for Istanbul. The west-bound train, the Simplon-Orient Express with train number 8, left Istanbul Sirkeci Terminal at 21:50 hours local time heading for Paris, France. It was composed of ten cars consisting of sleeper cars, couchette cars and saloon cars, and was pulled by a 2-8-0 steam locomotive, number 45501 of TCDD 45171 Class. The signalman at Yarimburgaz railway station, Baki ƒ∞n√∂z√º, cabled the movement of the west-bound train number 8 to the signaller at Ispartakule railway station, Cahit Fƒ±rat. As Fƒ±rat received the message, he knew immediately that both trains were in the same occupied block section, and a head-on collision would be inevitable, because he had just allowed the east-bound motor train to pass. Both signalmen hastily informed authorized officials around by phone about a possible collision, and requested sending of rescue teams to the railway line position at . The collision occurred at on the railway line from Istanbul Sirkeci Terminal, and caused the motor train wrecked almost completely. The cars meshed and bent accordion-like, and overturned. The express train suffered damage only in the front part of its first car. The crash was heard by a guard of the munition depot in the nearby 213th Infantry Regiment. All the deaths and injuries were among the crew and passengers of the motor train. The passengers of the express train sustained relatively less harm. 95 people including five crew members of the motor train were killed and 150 passengers were injured. Rescue The operation management at Sirkeci Terminal ordered a rescue train to the accident scene as soon as they received the information about the accident. Fire engines were deployed from nearby Bakƒ±rk√∂y Fire Department for fire risk on the spot. The fireman of the steam locomotive prevented a possible fire by removing the ember from the accident scene. The governor of Istanbul Fahrettin Kerim G√∂kay, Istanbul Chief of Police Hayrettin Nakipoƒülu, Bakƒ±rk√∂y District Prosecutor and Sirkeci Terminal Operations Deputy Director arrived at the crash scene right after the midnight to administer the rescue efforts. The prosecutor and the commander of the local gendarmerie started with investigation works. Both signalmen were arrested and sent to Bakƒ±rk√∂y Court, charged for the main responsible persons of the accident. Military units from around were ordered to take part in the rescue efforts. The smashed train wreckage had to be cut apart by oxy-fuel welding in order to recover the bodies of the dead and injured. The corpses were lined up beside the railway to enable their identification by the relatives. People with severe and less severe injuries were picked up and transported to the next Halkalƒ± railway station by a train, which was specially sent to the accident scene at 23:30 hours local time. They were then advanced in ambulances to ten different major hospitals within Istanbul. 50 passengers, who received outpatient treatment, were released soon. The day after the accident, the newspapers published the names of the dead and injured. Some of the severely injured people died later in hospital. Following the completion of the works for wreckage removal, the railway line was re-opened to traffic at 20:00 hours local time the next day. Investigation and trial An inspector of the Turkish State Railways (TCDD) prepared an accident investigation expertise for the court, in which the following failures were outlined: * the steam locomotive of the Simplon-Orient-Express was not equipped with headlights, * the cars of the motor train were old and wooden. They broke easily during the accident and contributed to the increased death toll, and * the cars of the express train made an early braking impossible. On March 26, 1959, the First Criminal Court in Istanbul found the signalmen Cahit Fƒ±rat 60% and Baki ƒ∞n√∂z√º 40% of guilty, and sentenced them to three years and two-and-half-years in prison respectively. In addition, they were punished to fines of 2,250 and 2,000 respectively. The court ruled further that the TCDD pay compensation to the injured and relatives of the dead.

Early life Alex was educated at Bedford Modern School, where his father taught PE. He had ambitions to become a cricketer, having captained his school team at county level, before his interest in art at the age of 16. He studied painting at Chelsea College of Arts, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts, and became a member of the Royal Society of Sculptors. Career Shortly after college, he was granted a Gilbert Bayes award by the Royal Society of Sculptors to help in his transition to professional practice, following which he collaborated with Conrad Shawcross on his work. After initially focusing on small sculptures, influenced by House designed by Rachel Whiteread and the work of Richard Wilson, Chinneck started working on large scale designs. Most of Chinneck's installations feature across Greater London. His early works include Telling the Truth Through False Teeth (2012), where the artist used 1,248 pieces of glass to create 312 identically smashed windows across the derelict facade of a factory in Hackney, From the Knees of my Nose to the Belly of my Toes (2013) in Margate where Chinneck created the illusion that the entire facade of house had slid into the garden, and Under the Weather but Over the Moon (2013), a commercial property situated on Blackfriars Road created to look as if it had become completely inverted. For his work in Hackney, local residents have described Chinneck as the \\"Banksy of Glass\\". His more recent works include Take my Lightning but Don't Steal my Thunder (2014), a building located in Covent Garden designed to appear as if it floated in the air, and A Pound of Flesh for 50p (2014), a house on Southwark Street made from 7,500 paraffin wax bricks which slowly melted. The installation, Pick Yourself Up and Pull Yourself Together (2015) saw a Vauxhall Corsa suspended upside down in Southbank Centre car park.

John Holzer, S.J. to start a parish in Guelph. In 1857, Fr. Holzer built a rectory, with the intention of it becoming a pre-novitiate. On 7 May 1862, the college opened, but closed less than three years later because of insufficient numbers.History from Church of Our Lady Immaculate, Guelph, retrieved 21 July 2014 =Construction= In 1913, while the Jesuits were serving the churches in Guelph, such as the Church of Our Lady Immaculate, they built the novitiate in north Guelph. It started when thirteen English-speaking Canadian Jesuits came to Guelph and purchased an old farmhouse, additional land, 240 hectares and renovated the farmhouse. It was for the training of future Jesuits and was called the St. Stanislaus Novitiate.History from OrchardParkCentre.ca retrieved 21 July 2014 =Guelph Raid= On 7 June 1918, military officers came and surrounded the building in search of men who may have joined the Jesuits to avoid conscription. This resulted in a scandal, because the son of the Justice Minister of Canada, Charles Doherty was studying to be a Jesuit there at the time. The ensuing dispute revealed the feelings that emerged after the introduction of the Military Service Act. A Royal Commission was created to investigate the incident and discussion in the media subsided when the commission's report was published in November 1919.Hogan, Brian F., The Guelph Novitiate Raid: Conscription, Censorship and Bigotry during the Great War, CCHA, Study Sessions, 45, (1978), pp. 57-80.Raid on Guelph novitiate drew national attention in 1918 from Wellington Advertiser, 18 June 2014, retrieved 9 July 2014 =Expansion= Brick by the chapel entrance marking its opening by the Bishop of Hamilton In 1921, a wing was added to the building that housed a chapel. In 1934, an expansion was required and a new building was added to the west of the site. It was built to house the juniorate. The juniorate was where Jesuits who had completed the novitiate stage in formation would go on to study Classics before studying philosophy at Regis College in Toronto. It currently serves as offices for Nature Conservancy of Canada and is known as Orchard Park West. In 1949, a Federalist style extension was built on to the juniorate building. It currently houses offices for the Canadian Mental Health Association. In 1954, the original building on the site, the novitiate, burned down. Following the fire, a series of developments were undertaken so that the property could continue as a novitiate and juniorate. The federalist style building became the novitiate and the building was extended to the south and east to house the juniorate. The new extensions were built from 1958 to 1960. When building commenced, the St. Stanislaus Novitiate was renamed and became Ignatius College. Included in the building was an extension that served as the chapel for the people there. In 1959, the partially completed building was opened by the Bishop of Hamilton, Joseph Francis Ryan. Closure In 1967, the Classics ceased to be taught and the students were moved elsewhere.

It was built from 1885 to . It is also known as Goldicott. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1998.  History  This substantial, single-storeyed concrete residence was erected in 1885 for engineer Charles Lambert Depree and his family, using a construction method patented by Depree in Queensland in November 1871. Depree was born in London , studied engineering at King's College 1861-63, and while articled (1864‚Äì67) worked on several railway engineering contracts in Britain. In 1868 he was working in France, and there acquired an interest in concrete construction. The following year, Depree and his wife emigrated to Queensland, settling in Fortitude Valley in Brisbane. In June 1870, Depree erected a small concrete building at Fortitude Valley to demonstrate the potential of this material for Queensland construction, as a result of which he acquired several Government contracts. In November 1871 he patented an improved method of building in concrete, a system of moveable formwork. From 1872 until 1890 he was employed by the Queensland Railways Department, and as resident engineer in charge of the Stanthorpe section of the Southern and Western Railway, 1875‚Äì77, initiated the first Queensland use of concrete for culverts and a tunnel. In 1878 Depree was appointed District Engineer for Railways Maryborough, returning to Brisbane in the mid-1880s, where he took up the position of Assistant Engineer-in-Charge of Surveys from September 1886. In mid-1885, following his return to Brisbane, Depree erected his family home, Goldicott, on land at Toowong to which he had acquired title in 1874. Depree's purchase extended from the southern side of the hill above Kensington Terrace down to Sherwood Road, and from the crest above Kensington Terrace, the site offered extensive views over Toowong, Auchenflower and Milton. It had been part of several larger parcels of land alienated separately by EJ Bennett and John Collings in the late 1850s. Toowong, a \\"fashionable\\" suburb since the 1860s, developed rapidly after the opening of Toowong railway station on the Brisbane to Ipswich railway line in 1875. In the mid-1880s, Goldicott was in close proximity to bus and railway transport, School of Arts, state primary school and two private schools, and gas and water were laid along Sherwood Road. Goldicott was Brisbane's first poured concrete house, constructed in the monolithic, or one stone, process, using Depree's patented system of movable formwork and apparently built to his design. Contractors Rose and James were employing the technique for the first time. In July 1885, this unique method of housing construction warranted an article in the Brisbane Courier. The house was described as a substantial residence, measuring with wide verandahs all around, and walls high. All the walls and footings were constructed of concrete, the outer walls being thick, and the inner walls . The floors and roof were of timber, the latter being clad in slates. The stone used in the concrete mix came from the site, and was described as a kind of greenstone, strongly impregnated with quartz. The article listed several advantages of building in concrete (presumably supplied by Depree): construction was marginally cheaper than brick; concrete was superior to brick in imperviousness to heat, damp and sound; little skilled labour was required for the construction; stone or gravel for the concrete mix could be obtained on site; and concrete was white-ant resistant. Despite the press coverage, concrete housing did not capture popular imagination in the 1880s. Goldicott was erected just as Queensland was entering the most significant economic boom of the 19th century, when the new middle class could afford housing built of brick and stone, the traditional symbols of wealth and prestige. No other concrete houses of this period have been recorded in this State, and Goldicott remains important as an early Queensland experiment in concrete housing. The place may also be significant on a national level. The Depree family resided at Goldicott from 1885 until 1890, when Charles Depree's failing health precipitated their return to England. He died there in August 1893, and although the family did not return to Queensland, Goldicott remained their property until 1902. Following the Deprees' departure, Goldicott was let to Surveyor-General A McDowall, and then to William Lees. It remained vacant for some years in the mid-1890s, but by 1897 was occupied by contractor John McCormick, whose firm John McCormick & Son had erected the second Albert Railway Bridge at Indooroopilly in 1893-94, and won the contract for the ironwork on the second permanent Victoria Bridge, erected 1896-97. In May 1902, the Goldicott Estate was subdivided and offered for auction, at which time the whole of the property, including the unfurnished house, was purchased by the Sisters of Mercy. The Sisters were to staff a new parish school to be established in nearby Holland Street, Toowong, and were seeking conveniently located accommodation. They took up residence in Goldicott, which was renamed Mount St Mary's Convent, in 1903. At this time the front room at the northeast corner of the house (probably formerly a bedroom), was converted into a chapel. In 1916, Archbishop James Duhig created the parish of Toowong by separating Toowong and Indooroopilly from Rosalie, and placed it under the charge of a group of newly arrived Jesuit Fathers. At Toowong, these fathers established the first permanent Jesuit presence in Queensland. However, the Sisters of Mercy continued to staff the parish school in Holland Street, and in the late 1920s gave to the parish just under 3/4 of an acre of land at the corner of Kensington Terrace and Grove Street, part of Mount St Mary's grounds, for the construction of a new church and school. The Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola, with the new school established in the undercroft, was opened and blessed on 18 May 1930. The Sisters continued to staff the parish school until the early 1980s. A 1902 photograph of Goldicott reveals that the front terraces had been formed by this date, but many of the stone walls in the grounds of the convent may date to , when the site for St Ignatius Church was being levelled and substantial quantities of stone would have become available. The eastern terrace, which contained an early tennis court, was most likely formed by 1902. The timber wing at the rear of the convent was erected , as a dormitory for children who were accepted as boarders at St Michael's (later St Ignatius) School. From the early 1900s, the Sisters had accommodated a few boarders at Mount St Mary's, but in 1919, this number increased to 19, and it is likely the dormitory wing was completed about this time. It is understood that the Sisters ceased taking in student boarders in the 1940s. During the Second World War, a new classroom block was erected behind St Ignatius Church and fronting Grove Street, at which time the Sisters of Mercy agreed that students could use part of the convent grounds (the terrace on the northern side of the house) as a playground. Later the eastern terrace was developed as a playing field with tennis and basketball courts. Sloping land at the rear of the convent was filled gradually, and levelled for a playing field in the 1980s. As well as teaching general subjects, the Sisters encouraged cultural pursuits such as music and speech lessons. At some stage a small weatherboard building had been moved onto the convent grounds for use as a music room. At one time the date of this building was recorded as \\"prior to 1967\\" however aerial photos from the 1930s show the building to be onsite by at least 1937. There is anecdotal evidence that the building once formed part of the Premiers Stables at Auchenflower House. Bernard Fanning, the lead singer of Powderfinger, took music lessons in the building. In 1992 the building was refurbished, at which time a hand painted, full-length mural on the walls of the entrance hall was revealed and subsequently covered again with wallpaper. Goldicott remained the property of the Sisters of Mercy and functioned as a convent until 2017 when it was sold to a property developer. Until it was sold, the house, music room and land had strong ties to the Toowong Catholic Community, being used for formal and informal events. For many years an opera event called Goldicott Under the Stars was held in the grounds of the house as a fund raiser for the neighbouring Catholic School. In 2018 the property developer sought permission to rezone the land, subdivide the property and demolish the historic weatherboard music room building. Media reported that the developer intended to erect a 600 bed aged care facility.https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/will-goldicott-house- in-toowong-be-turned-into-an-aged-care-facility/news- story/3a906746275c67f6865616b3260d223e Thousands of locals objected to the plans and the development application was rejected by the Brisbane City Council. The decision of the Council has been appealed by the developer to the Planning and Environment Court. Numerous objectors joined the proceedings and gave evidence of the heritage value of the house, music room and surrounds. As at early September 2019 the court decision is pending.  Description  Mount St Mary's Convent is a substantial one-storeyed concrete house situated on a prominent site in Grove Crescent, Toowong, overlooking the adjacent St Ignatius Catholic Church and with expansive views of Toowong and the Brisbane central business district. The house is sited on a ridge and the property is terraced and has established vegetation including a Hoop Pine, jacarandas, frangipannis, mango trees and assorted eucalyptus. A simple timber building dominates the entrance to Mount St Mary's Convent from Grove Crescent. Original concrete steps leading to the house on the eastern side are decorated with early large terracotta urns. The house consists of the 1885 concrete section and a two-storey timber extension at the rear. The concrete section has a simple rectangular plan surrounded on three sides by a wide timber verandah, the soffit of which is clad with beaded boards and supported on pairs of square timber columns featuring large decorative timber sweeps. The high pitched double hipped roof of the early house, is clad with corrugated iron sheeting and abuts a smaller hipped section over the dining room. This principal roof is distinct from the hipped roof over the kitchen wing and later extensions. The early section of the house is constructed of mass concrete prepared in situ and cast with the specially devised movable formwork. The early concrete foundations have recently been underpinned. The external faces of the concrete walls on the verandah are rendered and scoured in imitation of ashlar stonework, whilst other external faces are plain rendered. The main entrance is on the north facade of the house, accessed by two tiers of recent concrete stairs. A large entrance door with side lights and a transom, is emphasised by a gable featuring a decorative timber fretwork panel. The doorway is flanked by two full length bay windows, of concrete construction, with full length sash walk through windows. A cavity above the window conceals the opened lower sash. The building features many timber framed vertical sash windows, with concrete sills. Several former walk-through windows have been shortened to form conventional sash windows, by introducing timber panels in the lower section of the original doorway. The interior is planned around a central entrance hall and adjoining L-shaped corridor, off which the major rooms are accessed. Though the wall finishes in the entrance hall are recent, beneath the wall-paper is a full length mural depicting flora and bird-life. The hall is fitted with an original gas light fitting. To the right of the entrance hall is the parlour and community room which are separated by two full-height three-leaf timber folding doors, extending the width of the room. A white marble fireplace with early ceramic tiles is featured in the parlour, and an ebonised timber fireplace, featuring etched relief patterns, is in the rear community room. To the left of the entrance hall is the room now used as a prayer room, but originally likely to have been the main bedroom. A number of bedrooms open from the corridor beyond the entrance hall. These bedrooms also open onto a rear or side verandah, allowing access to the bathroom in the south-eastern corner. Early beaded board timber partitioning occurs in one of the bedrooms. The dining room adjoins the single storeyed early timber kitchen wing, onto which the double storeyed timber extension was constructed. The kitchen is now partitioned, and an early external brick chimney shows the extent of the original room. This wing is connected to the main house by an open timber verandah walkway extending to the later timber addition. The interior walls are generally of concrete, finished with wall-paper and featuring a reproduction cornice. The floor has been raised which has caused shallow skirting boards.  Heritage listing  Mount St Mary's Convent was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Mount St Mary's Convent (Goldicott) was erected during the second phase of Toowong's development, following the opening of Toowong railway station in 1875, and is important in illustrating: # the retention of the ridge above Kensington Terrace and Sherwood Road as an area of substantial homes situated within extensive grounds, this pattern having been established in the early 1860s # the emergence of ribbon development along Brisbane's late 19th century railways. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Mount St Mary's Convent (Goldicott), erected in 1885, was the first poured concrete house in Brisbane, and probably in Queensland. It is significant as an early and very rare Queensland experiment in concrete housing, and is important in demonstrating a high degree of technical achievement. The concrete construction was innovative and remarkable for its time. The place is significant for its association with engineer Charles Lambert Depree, and his contribution to concrete construction implementation and technology in 19th century Queensland. Mount St Mary's Convent (Goldicott) has retained a considerable proportion of its original grounds which allow the house to remain remote in the midst of extensive development. This is a rare example of an 1880s house in Toowong which has retained substantial grounds and outlook. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. It is significant as an early and very rare Queensland experiment in concrete housing, and is important in demonstrating a high degree of technical achievement. The concrete construction was innovative and remarkable for its time. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Established trees and terraces contribute to its aesthetic significance by contributing to the building's picturesque qualities. The house has a number of early fittings, including the entrance hall light fitting and various joinery items. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period.

The first wave of immigration occurred between 1890 and 1914 and was primarily composed of economic migrants seeking employment.Satzewich 2003, p. 26 The second wave occurred in between World War I and World War II.Satzewich 2003, p. 49 During World War II, a third wave occurred, which contained more political refugees than the first two waves of immigration.Satzewich 2003, p. 86 The current wave of immigration, known as the ‚Äúfourth wave,‚Äù is economically driven with emigrants moving to find better living conditions and higher wages.Satzewich 2003, p. 190-192 While immigrants from the three previous waves tended to settle in Ukrainian communities in New York or Chicago, members of the fourth wave are increasingly settling in California, ‚Äúchoosing cities with more lucrative job opportunities.‚Äù Shevchuk 2003, p. 12 The number of Ukrainians in California increased by 73.7%, from 54,141 to 94,044 people, from 1990 to 2006 while the number of Ukrainians decreased by -2.0% in New Jersey and only increased by 20.4% in New York.Wolowyna October 2009 p. 9 Now, 16.9% of all Ukrainian-Americans live in the Pacific Coast area, which is a 67.7% growth in share from 10.1% of the total population in 1990. The population of Ukrainian-Americans in the greater Los Angeles area increased by 23.6% from 21,398 people in 1990 to 26,456 people in 2006.Wolowyna October 2009 p. 12  Demographics  The 2010 United States Census reported 26,222 persons declaring themselves to be of partial or full Ukrainian ancestry living in the Los Angeles county area. Of this population, 15,872 were reported as being born in the U.S. while 10,350 were born in foreign countries. Of the foreign born, 27.8% emigrated between 1953 and 1987, and 68.9% emigrated between 1988 and 2010.\\"Ukrainians by Year of Immigration\\" The median age of the Ukrainian population in Los Angeles is 42 years old.\\"Age by Sex\\" 31.7% of the population is between 45 and 65 years old, and 22.5% of the population is older than 65. Roughly half of the population is male and half is female. Culture =Language= The two Eastern European languages primarily spoken by Ukrainians in Los Angeles are Russian and Ukrainian. As of 2010, 26.2% of Ukrainians in Los Angeles speak Russian at home and 6.4% speak Ukrainian.\\"Number of Persons of Ukrainian Ancestry and of Persons Speaking Ukrainian or Russian at Home, by Metropolitan Area: United States, 2010*\\" In the state of California, 26.0% of Ukrainians speak Russian and 18.5% speak Ukrainian at home.\\"Number of Persons of Ukrainian Ancestry and of Persons Speaking Ukrainian or Russian at Home, by State: United States, 2010*\\" =Religion= Ukrainian-Americans in Los Angeles of the Christian faith are primarily either a member of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church or the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. In Los Angeles, there are two Ukrainian Orthodox churches, the Saint Andrew First Called Ukrainian Orthodox Church,\\"Saint Andrew First Called Ukrainian Orthodox Church\\" and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Saint Vladimir (Volodymyr).\\"Saint Volodymir Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Home\\" There is also a Ukrainian Catholic Church, the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Ukrainian Catholic Church.\\"Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Ukrainian Catholic Church - About - Google+\\" All three churches were founded in the 1950s after the immigrant wave of Ukrainians that fled Soviet oppression and brutality during World War II fled Ukraine. These immigrants were interned at various Displaced Person's camps throughout Germany after World War II before finally arriving in Southern California. Saint Andrew First Called Ukrainian Orthodox Church was founded by several families. After a thorough search was conducted for the location of the new parish, the site selected was high on a hilltop offering some of the most beautiful panoramic views of downtown Los Angeles, Century City and the entire Los Angeles basin, stretching all the way to the Pacific Ocean. =Political Engagement= An anti-war rally called Rally Against Russian Invasion in Ukraine took place on Sunday, September 21, 2014 at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles, Ca.Euromaidan Press \\"Euromaidan Press\\" September 21 is the International Day of Peace, and marches for peace are held all over the world. The anti-war rally in Los Angeles consisted of a couple hundred Ukrainian-Americans, and they protested against Russia‚Äôs involvement in the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. = Diaspora Organizations= The California Association to Aid Ukraine (CAAU) is an all-voluntary, non-profit organization based in southern California that channels local support and fundraising for the people of Ukraine. The CAAU has partnered with the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles to send medical equipment to Ukraine. They also pay to bring Ukrainian doctors to Los Angeles for training at Cedars-Sinai.\\"CAAU: Our Programs\\" The Ukrainian Culture Center (UCC) is located at 4315 Melrose Ave in the East Hollywood area of Los Angeles. Founded in 1940, and celebrating its 70th anniversary in 2014, UCC hosts weekly children‚Äôs Ukrainian school and Ukrainian folk dancing for children and adults. Additionally, the Center hosts the Annual Pysanka Festival, the Taras Shevchenko Annual Commemoration, as well as yearly Ukrainian Independence celebrations and Holodomor remembrance events. The Holodomor remembers the 7 million Ukrainian genocide victims of the man-made famine that Soviet dictator Josef Stalin imposed on the Ukrainian nation in response to their attempts to gain freedom and build a democratic society. The Center is directed by Ukrainians and Americans of Ukrainian descent who are professionals in fields ranging from arts, entertainment, law and finance. The goals of UCC are to develop coordinate and guide the national civic life of its members and to conduct various activities intended to represent Ukrainian culture, preserve worthwhile customs and traditions of the Ukrainian people to resident of Southern California. The Center works closely with governmental leaders, both local and national, to achieve these goals. One of the most instrumental individuals in organizing UCC at its current location was Mykola Novak. In the 1960s, after locating the former Jensen Theatre as the new home for UCC, Mr. Novak not only negotiated an exceptional price for the building but later took a year sabbatical from his job in order to volunteer to repurpose the former movie theater for use by the Ukrainian community. Working days and evenings Mr Novak and other volunteers reconstructed the previously sloping floor of the theater and leveled it, completely restored the 1920s era theater to its former architectural glory including refurbishing and full restoration, but also updating the structure to then current building codes. This immense work was all done by local Ukrainians who not only volunteered their time but also donated all the needed building supplies and material. Though these community members only recently arrived to the Los Angeles area having lived in the Displaced Person's camps that permeated Germany after World War II, they were not fully established in their new lives in the United States but, nevertheless, donated many hours and dollars to build a new home for the Ukrainian Diaspora. The result was creating one of the most beautiful culture centers in all of the United States. UCC also founded the Ukrainian National Museum in Ontario, California, publishes the \\"Visti\\" magazine to provide updates and communication to the region's Ukrainians, supports the Chervona Kalyna Ukrainian Folk Dance Troupe, and provides continued financial assistance to the Ridna Shkola of Los Angeles. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s UCC sponsored Captive Nation's week with the support of the Los Angeles Mayor's office to recognize and support those countries who remained dominated under Soviet oppression. UCC sent a delegation to the Democratic National Convention, and has worked in conjunction with other organizations representing Bulgarians, Croatians, Estonians, Hungarians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Poles, Romanians, Serbs and among others, more recently uniting for the Annual European Heritage Festival. UCC is the home of the nationally recognized choir \\"Kobzar\\" which has been led by such well known and astounding directors such as Volodymyr Bozhyk, who was also the co-conductor - along with Hryhory Kytasty - of the world-renowned Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus of Detroit, Michigan. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA), the representative organization for the Ukrainian diaspora in the United States, has a branch in Los Angeles.

It is within the grounds of the Ignatius Jesuit Centre situated on Woolwich Street to the west of Riverside Park. In the 1960s and 1970s it was the centre of a significant shift in Ignatian spirituality.\\"English, John J.

In 1962, the decision was made by the Society of Jesus to sell the site and move the centre to Guelph. The old site in Oakville became the Glen Abbey Golf Course. From 1962 construction began on the spirituality centre in Guelph, helped by financial assistance from Bishop Joseph Ryan of Hamilton. In 1964, it was opened and was called the Guelph Centre of Spirituality. At first, it only hosted weekend retreats for parishioners from churches within the Diocese of Hamilton. From the late 1960s to the 1970s it became the centre of a change in how retreats in Ignatian spirituality were conducted and changed its name to Loyola House. Two Jesuit priests, John English, S.J. and John Veltri, S.J. altered the experience for those on retreat. They came from St Beuno's College in Wales with new ideas about Ignatian spirituality. Before this time, retreats were preached; at certain times in the day, those on retreat would all be told what to pray. Veltri and English changed this by providing points for prayer through daily interviews with the retreatants, giving personal one-to-one spiritual direction. Veltri was at Loyola House from 1967, and English was the novice master at the St. Stanislaus Novitiate next door in 1965, moving over to Loyola House in 1978.John Veltri, S.J. and John English, S.J., In Dialogue with Father John English, S.

While the novitiate was attended by the son of the Justice Minister of Canada, Charles Doherty, Canadian military officers surrounded it attempting to enforce the Military Service Act, causing a Royal Commission to be appointed by the Parliament of Canada in April 1919. Background The Military Service Act was passed in 1917 to increase the men enlisted to replace the casualties in World War I. When it was enforced in on 1 January 1918, riots broke out in Quebec in protest at the act.Auger, Martin F. \\"On the Brink of Civil War: The Canadian Government and the Suppression of the 1918 Quebec Easter Riots\\" from Canadian Historical Review 89/4 (2008), pp 9, 15-17, 83 By April 1918, the government had amended the act so that most of the exemptions had been removed, such as those working on farms, except \\"clergy, including members of any recognised order of an exclusively religious character, and ministers of all religious denominations existing in Canada at the date of the passing of this Act.\\"\\"The Military Service Act,\\" Ottawa: The King's Printer, 1917. However, the question on when a clerical student becomes clergy was an issue. Catholic seminarians became members of the clergy at the start of their training. Protestant students for the priesthood became clergy or ministers at the end of their training. Charles Doherty the Minister of Justice felt that the act exempted Catholic students for the priesthood. However, in late May 1918, enforcement of the act no longer became the responsibility of the police under the Ministry of Justice, but the Military Police who came under the Department of Militia and Defence. Many, such as General S. C. Mewburn, Minister of the Militia and Defence, Henry Westoby, the military representative in Guelph, and Colonel Godson-Godson, Provost Marshall for Canada, were either not aware of the Minister of Justice's previous interpretation, or did not agree with it.Hogan, The Guelph Novitiate Raid. Timeline * 30 May 1918: Colonel Godson-Godson, Provost Marshal for Canada, telegraphed military representatives in London, Ontario, asking why students at the Guelph novitiate had not been 'called'. * 5 June 1918: General Mewburn sent a memo to London, Ontario, asking why the novitiate had not been 'cleaned out'. Major J. Hirsch then asked Captain A. C. Macauley to organise a squad to search the novitiate for evaders.Stephen Thorning, \\"Raid on Guelph novitiate drew national attention in 1918\\" from Wellington Advertiser, 18 June 2014, retrieved 9 July 2014 * 9:30pm on 7 June 1918: A squad led by Captain Macauley all dressed in civilian clothes, surrounded the Jesuit Novitiate in Guelph. Macauley and Inspector Menard went into the novitiate and met the rector, Fr. Bourque S.J., who was ordered to present all the novices within 5 minutes. He sought advice from Fr. Wm. Hingston S.J., an army chaplain with the rank of Captain, to meet Macauley and Menard. Hingston came in full military dress and requested to see Macauley's documentation. Macauley provided a document that said that he needed authorisation, but refused to show the authorisation itself. Three Jesuit novices were arrested, including Marcus Doherty the son of Charles Doherty, the Minister of Justice. * Midnight on 7 June 1918: After interrogation, Marcus Doherty phoned his father. Macauley then spoke with the Minister of Justice who told Macauley that he was acting illegally, he should withdraw from the novitiate and explain his actions in a report. He also requested that no information be given to the press. * 8 June 1918, Macauley returned to the novitiate to obtain a complete list of information. * 19 June 1918: The Toronto Star broke the story, triggering other newspapers to report on the incident for the next 3 months. After this Macauley was transferred to Winnipeg. The Jesuits transferred Fr. Bourque to be rector of St. Paul's College, Manitoba. * 16 August 1918, The Guelph Daily Herald wrote about sermons by Rev. M. B. Christie and Rev. Kennedy Palmer of the Guelph Ministerial Association who 'exhorted the Orangemen to stand firm against the menace of the Roman Catholic Church' and that it appeared that the Church 'had its hand at the throat of the new government'. * Early September 1918: Rev. Kennedy Palmer went on a tour of Western Canada to speak about his views on what happened in Guelph. * 7 April 1919: Motion in Parliament requesting a Royal Commission on the events in Guelph to investigate charges brought by Palmer against Doherty and the Department of Justice of improper conduct and interference in the application of the Military Service Act to the Jesuit novitiate and imposing censor on the news of the affair.Stephen Thorning, \\"1918 raid on novitiate remained a hot issue for months\\" from Wellington Advertiser, Volume 45, Issue 39, retrieved 15 November 2014\\"Royal Commission will prode Guelph novitiate affair\\" from Montreal Gazette, 8 April 1919, retrieved 10 November 2014. * 9 September 1919: First of five days of testimony taken by the Royal Commission on the affair.Hear the counsel sum up argument in novitiate case from The Toronto World, September 13, 1919. * 3 November 1919: Royal Commission report published. It stated that there were 'no foundation' for any charge against Charles Doherty, the Minister of Justice, and the Department of Justice. Also, it stated that all of the Jesuit novices were exempt from the Military Service Act. It went on to say that Macauley made three errors: He did not produce any written authority at the novitiate, he conducted the raid in civilian clothes and that he was highhanded in his manner throughout the evening.\\"Both ministers acted properly in raid affair\\" from Montreal Gazette, 4 November 1919, retrieved 10 November 2014.

An American Plague was one of the finalists in the 2003 National Book Award and was a 2004 Newbery Honor Book. It portrays the agony and pain this disease brought upon the American people marking its place in history in order to never be forgotten. Plot It is the year 1793 in Philadelphia. At this point Philadelphia is considered to be the largest city located in North America. The city is hit with an incurable and unknown disease. The disease killed about 50% of the people effected. The author Jim Murphy describes a disease called the yellow fever and how it affected the residents of Philadelphia. In the novel he highlights the heroic roles and actions that the Philadelphia free blacks took in order to fight this deadly disease. He also didn't forget to let readers know about the constitutional crisis our first American president George Washington was facing that lead to him leaving the city of Philadelphia, and everything he owned and knew behind, because of this deadly disease. The cure for the disease was not found until centuries later. Characters Dr. Benjamin Rush: Developed a radical treatment process for the yellow fever disease which involved withdrawing blood from patients and giving patients mercury and the root of a poisonous plant. Mayor Matthew Clarkson: The only government leader who stayed to deal with the issues that were going on in Philadelphia when the plague was taking place. President George Washington: Was involved with foreign affairs when the plague struck and was out of touch with the government affairs for the time length of six weeks while the plague was taking over Philadelphia. Thomas Jefferson: Was the Secretary of State when the plague struck Philadelphia. Edmond-Charles Gen√™t: Was the French Ambassador who wanted the Americans to help France with their revolution. The Reverend J. Henry c. Helmuth: Believed that the plague was a punishment sent by god because there was an increase in gambling as well as in drinking among the people of Philadelphia. Absalom Jones: Was involved in the building of the St. George's United Methodist Church and, after participating and helping build the church, was told to sit in the back of the church by the church leaders. Matthew Carey: Wrote a book that was pronounced to be a best seller titled \\"A Short Account of the Malignant Fever\\" Dr. William Currie: Believed that the fever came from a shipment that came from the West Indies and claimed that it was not the yellow fever. Critical reception Critics that were able to engage with the book found it to be very intriguing. It has been stated that Jim Murphy created an impeccable book that draws the reader in while at the same time creating fear. He is able to describe how horrid this period of time was for history with solid research and amazing facts. \\"In a lavishly illustrated book, containing maps, newspaper columns and period illustrations, Jim Murphy unflinchingly presents the horrors of the event as well as its heroes\\" states Anita Silvey. Kirkus Reviews named it Starred Review and found the book to be \\"A mesmerizing, macabre account...powerful evocative prose... compelling subject matter...fascinating discussion...valuable lesson in reading and writing history. Stellar.\\"\\"Leisurely, lyrical tone...Murphy injects the events with immediacy...archival photographs...bring the story to life...comprehensive history.\\" was Publishers Weekly's opinion about the work. Murphy spotlights the heroic role of Philadelphia's free blacks in combating the disease, and the Constitutional crisis that President Washington faced when he was forced to leave the city ‚Äî and all his papers ‚Äî while escaping the deadly contagion.

It was designed by architect John Francis Hennessy, junior, and built from 1929 to 1936 by Concrete Construction (QLD) Limited. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 July 2005.  History  View from Grove Street, 2014 The Roman Catholic Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola at Toowong was opened in 1930 and is a Romanesque building designed by Sydney architect John Francis Hennessy. It was constructed as part of Archbishop James Duhig's vision for the development of the Church in Brisbane through a major building program that included several such landmark churches. Although there was European settlement at Toowong in the 1860s, the area did not develop until the opening of the Brisbane to Ipswich railway line in 1875 made it readily accessible. A number of villa houses were constructed on large estates on the Toowong ridge, while more modest residences occupied the lower levels. The first St Thomas Church of England opened in 1875 and by 1878 Toowong had enough families to warrant a provisional school. In 1879, the first Catholic Mass was celebrated at Toowong in a private home, as there was no church in the area. Catholics living in the area attended St Stephens Cathedral in the Brisbane central business district. In 1888 Archbishop Robert Dunne purchased land in Holland Street below the site of the present church and on 9 April 1893 the new timber church, called St Michael and the Holy Souls, was blessed and opened there. In 1902, the Sisters of Mercy purchased a large private home, Goldicott, at the top of the hill and took up residence there, naming it Mount St Mary's Convent. They began teaching at the school next to the church in 1903. A tramline from the city opened in 1904 and was soon extended, contributing to the growth of the Toowong area. In 1912, James Duhig became Dunne's Co- Adjudicator, taking on much of his administrative duties. The first Catholic Brisbane parishes were erected at Coorparoo, Kangaroo Point, South Brisbane, Red Hill and Rosalie, the parish of Toowong being later formed from part of Rosalie. Although Dunne had only encouraged the Sisters of Mercy and the Christian Brothers to establish branches of their orders themselves in Queensland, Duhig was keen to encourage other religious orders in order to expand education. In August 1915 he wrote to Father John Ryan of the Society of Jesus in Sydney in this regard. In 1916 Toowong became the responsibility of the Jesuits who purchased and enlarged a house near the church for use as a presbytery. It was opened on St Ignatius Loyola Day, 30 July 1916. By the early 1920s, both church and school were becoming inadequate for the growing congregation and the distance between convent and school had always been inconvenient for the teaching nuns, so the Sisters of Mercy provided a solution by offering part of their land for a new building. A public meeting was held in November 1928 at which it was suggested that costs could be kept down by building a hall underneath the church and by using it as a school. John Francis (Jack) Hennessy drew up the plans at the end of 1929. His father, also John Hennessy, founder of the Sydney firm of Hennessy and Hennessy, was an ecclesiastical architect who had worked on St Patrick's, Manly, and St Josephs at Hunters Hill. Duhig met the younger Hennessey when he was Bishop of Rockhampton and they had become friends. After Duhig became Archbishop of Brisbane, Jack Hennessey received a number of commissions from him. These included the churches of St Agatha, Clayfield (1925), Corpus Christi, Nundah (1926), and St Augustine, Coolangatta (1926). He also designed the ambitious Cathedral of the Holy Name whose construction commenced but was never completed. The foundation stone for the church was laid on 16 June 1929. Duhig announced at the ceremony that \\"the day of wooden churches are past\\" and that he hoped that no more would be built in the city. His vision for the development of the Catholic Church in Queensland included plans for the building of a number of substantial churches to manifest the strength and presence of the Church. Seeking landmark sites, he chose many on hilltops. The new church was built by Concrete Constructions Ltd and was supervised by Leo Drinan, Hennessy's partner in the Brisbane office. All materials used were of the best quality and all five altars were designed by H Credington of the Catholic Art Gallery in Melbourne and made in his studios at Carrara in Italy. Andrew Petrie and Sons erected them. Many handsome gifts were bestowed on the church, including altars, statuary and a number of stained glass windows by John Hardman of London and William Bustard, a noted local glass artist who created the \\"Magnificat\\" and \\"Christ the King\\" windows. The Architects and Builders Journal of Queensland, in its May edition, predicted that \\"This building should rank as one of the handsomest churches of its size in Queensland\\". The Catholic Leader of 22 May 1930 thought that \\"The Italian Romanesque style of architecture, with the scope for elaborate interior embellishment and bold use of colour, is eminently suitable to the climate of Queensland\\" and the church indeed has a high quality of interior detailing. This decorative work includes ornate main and side altars, statuary, stained glass and in particular, extensive and striking scagliola work to the sanctuary and pulpit. Scagliola (from scaglia or scales, after the natural form of the mineral used) is an artificial stone created from gypsum plaster, glues and dyes that can be made to imitate various types of stone, though usually rare types and colours of marble. The best work is visually indistinguishable from genuine marble, though it is far lighter, so that large and complex decorative features, such as the St Ignatius pulpit, can be constructed that would be difficult and costly to create in stone. The technique was developed in Germany and Italy at the end of the 15th century and was used mainly for decorating churches, such as San Miniato al Monte in Florence, Italy. Fine early examples of it also survive in secular buildings such as the Pantheon and Syon House in England. It became popular in America in the 19th century, the work being carried out by itinerant Italian craftsmen, though much was not of good quality. The art was revived in Australia by the Sydney firm of Melocco Brothers. In 1908 Italian Pietro Melocco arrived in Sydney and began a commission on St Mary's Cathedral, the magnificent decorated floors of which became his life's work. His two brothers joined him and their firm was responsible for most of Sydney's best mosaic and terrazzo work, though much of this has not survived. For the Government Savings Bank in Martin Place, Tony Melocco decided to use scagliola, a technique by then fallen into disuse. Finding no one in either Italy or America able to teach him, Galli Melocco moved to Brisbane in 1929 to set up a branch of the company, though he returned to Sydney a year later as the Depression reduced the demand for such decorative work. It is not known if any major scagliola project other than that at St Ignatius Church was carried out in Queensland. The church was blessed and opened by Archbishop Duhig on the 18 May 1930 and dedicated to St Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus. Its cost of included excavations, seating, lighting, decoration and fittings. The old church was relocated to Graceville, where it remains. Between 1933 and 1936 a number of works were carried out by Depression relief labour. Kensington Terrace was excavated and the land on the southern side of the church was excavated to provide better access. The spoil was used to reclaim land along the northern side of the church that is now used as a car park. The hall under the church did not prove suitable for long-term use as a school as it was too small and could not be divided into separate classrooms. On 3 November 1946 the foundation stone of a new school was laid to the west of the church. It was opened on 18 July 1948 and has been extended in several stages in the late 20th century. Father Leo Murphy, assistant priest at St Ignatius since 1942, died in 1957 and a fund was set up to purchase a pipe organ as a memorial to him and in accordance with the instructions of Pope Pius XII who had ruled that a pipe organ was the approved instrument for use during the liturgy and to accompany singing. The organ was constructed by Whitehouse at a cost of ¬£2050 and was installed on 2 February and blessed on 8 March 1959. The Sanctuary was paved with marble in February 1963 and new lighting was installed in the church and hall. Following changes recommended by the Second Vatican Council, the first mass at St Ignatius facing the people was held in 1966. A silky oak communion table was constructed for this purpose and donated by parishioner Frank Shuttlewood and his wife. The baptismal font of carved Carrara marble has been moved from the Baptistery to the front of the church and the confessional booths on either side of the rear of the church appear now to be used for storage.  Description  Parapet, 2014 The Roman Catholic Church of St Ignatius Loyola is a brick Romanesque building cut into a steeply sloping site on Toowong ridge. It commands a fine prospect across the city and its prominent position and square bell tower make it a landmark. It is a two-storey building with a hall on the lower level and the church proper on the upper level. The church has an asymmetric front with a stepped parapet and is constructed of decorative polychrome brickwork in orange and brown. The roof is clad in Roman terracotta tiles. The upper level is accessed by steps to a large terrace at the eastern end. It is cruciform in plan with a long nave and short transepts terminating in small chapels, on the northern side accessing an elaborate scagliola pulpit. Doors on the southern side are accessed by bridges that extend from a raised walkway. The ceiling is clad in fibrous cement sheeting with lattice vents and there is a choir loft faced with silky oak panelling above the eastern entrance, which contains the organ. Below this, on either side of the entrance are altars and in the wall on each side are the doors to confessional booths, now used for storage. Panels depicting the Stations of the Cross are set into the walls of the nave and at the western end is an apsidal chancel with vestries and a sanctuary approached through arches clad in orange veined scagliola and lined with the same material. The floors are concrete and are paved with marble in the Sanctuary. The lower floor has separate entrances and contains a large hall with a stage at the eastern end and a kitchen. There is an arcaded verandah along the northern side. Directly behind the church, and a few metres from it, is a brick school constructed on a similar scale, which is not considered to have heritage significance.  Heritage listing  The Roman Catholic Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 July 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola is important as evidence for the period of expansion of the Catholic Church in Queensland during the 1920s and 30s under the leadership of Archbishop James Duhig. It is one of the churches, substantial in fabric and notable for quality of design and finish, which were intended to demonstrate and encourage a strong Catholic presence in the diocese. It is a manifestation of the Catholic ethos of selecting imposing sites to produce prominent landmarks and is a characteristic of churches built during the time of Archbishop Duhig. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola is rare for its extensive use of scagliola for the sanctuary and pulpit which may be the only example of such use in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola is a particularly good example of an inter-war church, influenced by the fashionable revival of Romanesque church architecture in Australia, with its tower, picturesque massing and polychrome brickwork, a style favoured by Archbishop Duhig. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola has high aesthetic value as a well designed and visually pleasing building on a landmark site. The interior is notable for the quality of its fittings and finishes, including glass, altars, statuary and the use of scagliola for wall cladding and arches to the sanctuary and the ornate pulpit. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a parish church and formerly a school, it has been important for several generations of Catholics in the surrounding area as a source of spiritual, social and educational sustenance. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola has special associations with the life and works of Archbishop James Duhig and the architect John Francis Hennessey and with the work of the Society of Jesus in Queensland.

It features the Cradle of Forestry, waterfalls, trails and scenic vistas. Route description The scenic byway begins at the intersection of US 64 and NC 215, near Rosman (el. ). Traveling north, along the banks of the North Fork French Broad River, it reaches the Balsam Grove community; there, access to Courthouse Falls can be reach via Forest Road 140. At Pinhook Gap (el. ) the scenic byway enters through a small stretch of Jackson County before returning into Transylvania County. At Beech Gap (el. and highest point), the scenic byway enters Haywood County and connects with the Blue Ridge Parkway. Descending from the Pisgah Ridge, it soon follows the West Fork Pigeon River to Lake Logan (el. ); where originally existed a logging town known as Sunburst, until a devastating wildfire in 1925 closed the mill and then it was submerged by the lake in 1933. In Woodrow (el. ), named for President Woodrow Wilson, the scenic byway switches from NC 215 onto US 276 towards Brevard. The scenic byway, now following the East Fork Pigeon River, slowly ascends between Cold Mountain and Mount Pisgah. At Shining Creek Gap (el. ) is where the Shining Rock Trail Head is located and the beginning of the National Scenic Byway; making a curve and crossing over the East Fork Pigeon River, the scenic byway now quickly climbs up the Pisgah Ridge again. Crossing back into Transylvania County at Wagon Road Gap (el. ), it connects again with the Blue Ridge Parkway before making a switchback descent into the Pink Beds. The Pink Beds is an upland bog with dense growth of pink blooming rhododendrons and laurels. Located nearby is the Cradle of Forestry, where the very first school of forestry, the Biltmore Forest School, was founded by Carl A. Schenck in 1898. Three miles south from the Cradle of Forestry is Sliding Rock (el. ), a popular summertime location where visitors can get cool by sliding on rocks and into the pool below. Nearby is Looking Glass Falls, named by the mountain its on, the water appears like a mirror gleaming off its granite face. The Pisgah Forest National Fish Hatchery, located in the former logging camp of John Rock and along the Davidson River, is where trout is raised and released in the area rivers. Near Brevard is the Pisgah Visitor Center, where once stood a community around the Sycamore Flats area(el. ) and stands the historic English Chapel (1860-1940). Visitors may also see a pair of stone pillars, which were built to honor Transylvania County residents who served in World War I and also mark the border of the Pisgah National Forest. At the intersection of US 64/US 276 and NC 280, both the North Carolina Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway ends; the National Forest Scenic Byway, however, continues along US 64, through Brevard, to meet back with NC 215 to make a complete loop. Despite the overlap along US 64, no byway signage is marked along this section. A majority of the scenic byway was built along former railroad tracks that were used for logging operations in the area in the late 19th and early 20th century. The highways, both NC 215 and US 276, have 9% grades and curves that may require some drivers and most truckers to slow as much as ; thus the scenic byway is not recommended for recreational vehicles or buses. Each byway varies in length and general focus. The National Forest Scenic Byway is the longest and makes a loop along NC 215, US 276 and US 64 (as shown in article). The National Scenic Byway is the shortest with along US 276. The North Carolina Scenic Byway is along NC 215 and US 276. History The Forest Heritage Scenic Byway was established in 1989 as a United States Forest Service (USFS); in 1990, it also became a North Carolina Scenic Byway. In 2009, part of US 276 portion of the scenic byway was also designated as a National Scenic Byway, by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT).

He began his National Football League career as a member of the Cleveland Browns. Early life Vincent Mayle was born June 12, 1991, in Sacramento, California, to Renee Mayle. He has two older siblings: a sister, Tinea, and a brother, John. He was raised in a single-parent household in Natomas, California, a suburb of Sacramento. Tinea Mayle described him as ambitious but quiet, preferring to shock people with his actions and achievements rather than tell them about himself. Mayle grew up wanting to be a basketball player. He idolized LeBron James as a child, and earned the nickname \\"Little LeBron\\" in the sixth grade for his ability to mimic James' playing style. When he was 11 years old, Mayle obtained James' autograph at the 2003 ESPY Awards‚Äîthe first autograph Mayle ever got, and the first athletic autograph he ever obtained. Mayle did not play football until he began attending Inderkum High School. In the 2008 season (his senior year), Mayle played running back on offense and linebacker on defense. He scored 15 touchdowns that year. Mayle later admitted that despite his success on the football field, he almost never watched football on television. Mayle was not a good student, however, and although he graduated high school in 2009 his grades were so poor that he was not eligible under NCAA rules to play sports at a four-year college or university. College career =Junior college= Mayle subsequently enrolled at Shasta College, a community college in Redding, California, where he played college basketball for a year. But as a power forward, Mayle discovered he was too small and his peers too skilled for him to have much of a career playing basketball. Nevertheless, he averaged 8 points per game. When his mother suffered an accident in the summer of 2010, Mayle took a year off from school to care for her and worked several jobs to earn income. During his year off from school, Mayle decided to give up basketball for football, convinced it would get him farther in life. Deciding he would compete at the highest level possible, he began lifting weights to transform his body from the lean form required for basketball into the much more muscular physique needed for football while he continued to care for his mother. In the fall of 2011, Mayle returned to school, enrolling at Sierra College, a community college in Rocklin, California. He took a year off from sports in order to focus on academics, and his grades markedly improved. In the fall of 2012, his high school football coach convinced him to return to playing football. Mayle did so, Sierra College head coach Jeff Tisdel put the then- Mayle at wide receiver (after considering making him a defensive end, linebacker, and tight end). Mayle had 61 receptions for in the 2012 season, second-best in the state. His 16 touchdowns were the best of all receivers among all junior colleges in California, and he was named Valley Conference offensive Most Valuable Player and All-California Most Valuable Player. He also won a position on the Valley Conference First Team, All-State First Team, and Football All-American Junior College First Team. Mayle's focus on football could waver at times, and he too often allowed his athleticism compensate for skill or knowledge about the defense. Tisdel benched him for a game after Mayle dropped four passes in practice. The punishment brought his attention back to the field, and he caught four touchdowns in the next game. Determined to move up to a four-year college, Mayle continued to get good grades and took a heavy 20-credit course load in the spring of 2013 to make him eligible under NCAA rules. He also worked out heavily in the summer, and practiced passing routes on his high school playing field. Mayle was considered a three-star recruit (out of four possible stars) by college scouts. Mayle was recruited by a number of notable four-year collegiate football programs, including Arizona State University, Louisiana State University, Ohio State University, Texas A&M; University, the University of Kentucky, the University of Houston, the University of Miami, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and the University of West Virginia. Many other schools declined to recruit him, worried that he had only a single year of NCAA eligibility left. He chose Washington State University (WSU) after head coach Mike Leach and outside receivers assistant coach Dennis Simmons became the only coaches to visit him personally. =Washington State= At WSU, Mayle played football on a scholarship. He continued to lift weights seriously and improve his strength and stamina, and hone his receiving skills. He also lost a considerable amount of weight, dropping to from . One of his former high school football coaches, Terry Stark, called his physical transformation \\"incredible\\". He also continued his heavy off-season training and practice schedule. But during the 2013 season, Mayle began to lose his focus on football. He believed his superior athleticism was enough to allow him to win games, and he dismissed the technical and skill-building side of football. He didn't take practice seriously, was indifferent to the study of game film, and rarely talked to coaches or teammates. WSU receivers coach David Yost told him to \\"Stop making excuses and get your job done. You'd be a much better player if you stopped making excuses and get what you have to do done, instead of making excuses why you didn't get it done.\\" Mayle later recalled that this comment cut deeply, but also motivated him to get back on track athletically. The 2013 season started slowly for Mayle due to his difficulty adjusting to the far more competitive football world at WSU. He averaged just 1.4 catches and 14 yards per game in the first five matches. But in his final eight games, he caught 4.4 passes and had 54.9 yards per game. Mayle was fourth on the WSU squad in receptions (42) and yards (549), and caught five touchdowns in six games. He tied with Gabe Marks and Dominique Williams for a team-high seven touchdowns. He was a contender for the Fred Biletnikoff Award, an honor given to the most outstanding receiver in American college football. At the end of the 2013 season, WSU applied for and was granted a waiver by the NCAA, giving Mayle another year of college football eligibility. In the 2014 season, Mayle led the Pac-12 Conference in both receptions (106, 9 for touchdowns) and yards (1,483), was tied for second in the country for receptions, and was second- best receiver in the nation in receiving yards per game (123.6). Both the number of receptions and the number of yards were a WSU single-season best ever in the team's history, and he was one of only two players in the nation to have two 250-yard receiving games. He also led the nation in dropped passes (19). At the end of the season, he was appointed to the All-Pac-12 Second Team and Sports Illustrated magazine named him an All-America honorable mention. Professional career =Pre-draft= CBS Sports analyst Rob Rang said in November 2014 that he expected Mayle to be picked in the fourth or fifth round of the 2015 NFL draft. Rang called him \\"a pretty spectacular athlete\\", but felt he ran routes a little sloppily and occasionally lost his focus on the ball. But he had excellent speed and acceleration, and good evasion skills. In his last collegiate season, he led the FBS with 19 dropped passes, leading to many scouts citing that his inability to hold onto passes was a major concern. =Cleveland Browns= Mayle was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fourth round (123rd overall) of the 2015 NFL Draft. He was the highest WSU wide receiver picked in the draft pick since Jason Hill was drafted in the third round in 2007. The team announced on May 18 that Mayle would have surgery on his right thumb. Physicians determined Mayle broke his thumb while playing in the Senior Bowl in January, but that the injury was not properly diagnosed until NFL rookie mini-camp. On May 17, 2015, Mayle signed a four- year, $2.76 million rookie contract that also included a $473,152 signing bonus. Although he was a fourth round pick and still in his first season, Mayle was one of the Browns' final cuts during training camp on September 5, 2015. It was cited that he was cut due to dropping numerous passes throughout training camp. =Dallas Cowboys= On September 8, 2015, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys to their practice squad. On October 10, he was promoted to the active roster. Three days later he was waived and re-signed to the practice squad. On December 30, Mayle signed a 3-year, $1.575 million contract to return to the Dallas Cowboys. On September 3, 2016, he was released by the Cowboys and was signed to the practice squad the next day. He was promoted to the active roster on November 16, after tight end Geoff Swaim was lost for the season with an injury. He was used on special teams and to contribute as a blocker in the running game from his wide receiver position, but struggled with penalties. He was waived on December 29, to make room for offensive lineman Ryan Seymour, who was needed for depth purposes in the last game of the season, in order to rest some of the starters for the postseason play. =Baltimore Ravens= On December 30, 2016, Mayle was claimed off waivers by the Baltimore Ravens, to secure his rights for the 2017 season. He was declared inactive for the week 17th game. In 2017, he was moved to tight end during Organized Team Activities. He was the fourth-string tight end and made the team mainly because of his special teams contributions. On September 1, 2018, Mayle was waived by the Ravens. =Los Angeles Chargers= On September 25, 2018, Mayle was signed to the Los Angeles Chargers' practice squad. Mayle signed a reserve/future contract with the Chargers on January 14, 2019. He was waived/injured during final roster cuts on August 31, 2019, and reverted to the team's injured reserve list the next day. He was waived from injured reserve with an injury settlement on September 10. =Toronto Argonauts= Mayle signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL on January 27, 2020.

The agricultural machinery industry or agricultural engineering industry is the part of the industry, that produces and maintain tractors, agricultural machinery and agricultural implements. This branch is considered to be part of the machinery industry.  History  :See also history of Agricultural machinery and Mechanised agriculture = 19th century = The agricultural machinery industry emerged in Britain and the United States in the 19th century. Until then the common tools of farming were the plough and the sickle.R.C. Gifford. Agricultural Engineering in Development: Concepts and principles. 1992. p. 7-8 These iron agricultural implements were often made by blacksmiths in the local village, who regularly also acted as farrier. In the first part of the 19th century some of the early agricultural machine manufacturers arose from these blacksmith workshops,Jan H. Maas (1994) De Nederlandse agrosector: geografie en dynamiek p.177Gifford (1992, p. 9) even stated that \\"nearly all farm machinery manufacturers today can be trace their beginnings to a blacksmith.\\" such as John Deere who started up with the production of ploughs in series in the 1840s. Agricultural Implements, 1851. Other companies arose from the introduction of horse drawn reaping, which replaced the type of hand reaper in use since biblical times. A company as the McCormick started up with building these kind of harvesting machines around the 1840s. And another origin of agricultural industry was the introduction of combined harvesting, threshing and cleaning in the 1830s. The Case Corporation for example started building those in 1842 as the Racine Threshing Machine Works. Until early 20th century most of those machinery were powered by horses. Mid 19th century the portable steam-powered plowing engines were introduced. They were used in pairs, placed on either side of a field to haul a plow back and forth between them using a wire cable. These portable engines were also used to power threshing machines, mills and pumps. The portable steam engines were produced by specific agricultural machinery maker, such as Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies who had started as brass and iron-founder making casting ploughshares late 18th century. Late 19th century in Britain more companies such as Richard Garrett & Sons and Mann‚Äôs Patent Steam Cart and Wagon Company developed steam tractors for direct ploughing, but the heavy, wet soil of England meant that these designs were less economical than a team of horses. In the United States, where soil conditions permitted, steam tractors were used to direct-haul plows. Steam-powered agricultural engines remained in use well into the 20th century until reliable internal combustion engines had been developed. Collins (1987) recalled that the impact of the agricultural machinery industry in the 19th century was still limited. He stated : \\"prior the third quarter of the nineteenth century the impact of machinery in agriculture was slight compared with that in manufacturing industry. Some operations such as barn work and hay and corn harvesting had been largely mechanized by 1880 but, up to the Second World War, many were still performed by hand labour and large numbers of workers were still required for seasonal tasks such as hop- and fruit-picking and vegetable cultivations.\\"Collins, Edward JT. \\"The rationality of'surplus' agricultural labour: mechanization in English agriculture in the nineteenth century.\\" The Agricultural History Review (1987): 36-46. = 20th century = In the beginning of the 20th century in the UK the Agricultural machinery industry \\"although composed of many hundreds of firms, was dominated by a few large ones, chiefly in the eastern counties of England. The total output of the industry was estimated to be worth 6.5 million pounds in 1913, or about 5 percent of the total value of the output of the mechanical engineering industry at the first Census of Production in 1907.\\"Dewey, Peter. \\"The British Agricultural Machinery Industry, 1914-1939: Boom, Crisis, and Response.\\" Agricultural History (1995): 298-313. Agricultural exhibitions, 1951 In the first decennia the internal combustion engine; first the petrol engine, and later diesel engines; became the main source of power for the next generation of tractors. Early companies expanded into the tractor business, such as John Deere which bought the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company in 1918, which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor. In the 1930s new technologies as rubber ties and hydrologics were introduced in tractors and other farm machinery.Gifford (1992, p. 8) The diesel engines also contributed to the development of the self-propelled, combined harvester and thresher, or combine harvester (also shortened to 'combine'). Instead of cutting the grain stalks and transporting them to a stationary threshing machine, these combines cut, threshed, and separated the grain while moving continuously through the field. In the second part of the 20th century the production of agricultural machinery in development countries rose rapidly. In the 1960s a country as the UK exported more than 60% of its production to Western Europe, Australia, USA, Canada and South Africa, and main manufacturers started production plants abroad. Another trend was the increased concentration among manufacturers. In the 1970s in the UK six companies supplied 75% of the total output.Keith Cowling, David Metcalf, A. J. Rayner. (1973) Resource Structure of Agriculture: An Economic Analysis, p. 127-8See also: World bank (1954) Western Europe - Tractor and agricultural machinery industry. The further mechanization of agriculture in the 20th century made possible by the agricultural machinery industry had a huge impact of the economic structure of society. In the developed countries the total labour force engaged in agriculture dropped from about 75% in 1800 to less than 5% late 20th century.Gifford (1992, p. 9) In developing countries, in late 20th century still 75% of all land \\"was farmed with only hand-tools and draught-animal technology.\\"Gifford (1992, p. 10) In Turkey still 48% and in India 66.5% of the labor were working in agriculture, according to the FAO Production Yearbook 1990. = 21st century = A 2013 report by the VDMA gave the following preview of the current developments in the agricultural machinery industry: :\\"The general trends in society, agriculture and technology allow conclusions about the future requirements profile for agricultural machinery...

Agricultural Machinery November 2013 : Market Perspectives 2014, 2013-14. p. 5  Agricultural machinery  The agricultural machinery industry produces agricultural machinery, machinery used in the operation of agricultural areas and farms. Main types are:Ade Asefeso (2012). CEO Guide to Doing Business in Australia, p. 54 * Tractors and power. * Machinery for tillage or soil cultivation. * Machinery for planting, seeding, fertilizing, pest control, irrigation. * Machinery for harvesting, haymaking, and post-harvest, such as produce sorters, and machinery for loading * Machinery for milking * Other agricultural machinery, for example grinder mixers, wool presses and windmills. In developed countries overall the largest segment of agricultural equipment sales is tractors.  Agricultural machinery manufacturers  Agricultural machinery manufacturers exist in sizes from small and medium business to multinationals. James & Akrasanee (1988) stipulated that those forms have different production management, and can be classified into three groups: :* The first group consists of those workshops with limited and simple equipment. Despite their flexibility, the production management system is very rare in this case. :* The second group includes those with certain degrees of division of labour within the plant. They do organize some plant layout, but not in a fully systematic manner. :* The last group constitutes those with clear production lines and division of labour.Kenneth James, Narongchai Akrasanee.

Gyanendra (2006) recalled, that \\"the early agricultural mechanization in India was greatly influenced by the technological development in England. Irrigation pumps, tillage equipment, chaff cutters, tractors and threshers were gradually introduced for farm mechanization. The high yielding varieties with assured irrigation and higher rate of application of fertilizers gave higher returns that enabled farmers to adopt mechanization inputs, especially after Green revolution in 1960s.\\" The Turkish Ministry of Economy (2011) explained that \\"Turkey is one of the few countries of the world which is self-sufficient in food. At present Turkey is the largest producer and exporter of agricultural products in the Near East and North Africa... The agricultural machinery industry is about 1000 manufacturers countrywide.... Companies manufacturing agricultural machinery and equipment except tractors are mostly small and medium size companies. The sector employs about 15,000 workers... The value of agricultural machinery and spare parts and agricultural tractors and trailers exports was US$ 313 million in 2009.\\" = Agricultural machinery industry in Europe = With a volume of 28 billion euros (2014) agricultural machinery production in the European Union (EU) represented 28 per cent of world total according to VDMA. Out of the EU total, the share of Germany is 27 per cent, followed by Italy (17 per cent) and France (14 per cent). All leading international manufacturers have several production sites on the European continent, and their products from these factories in general are destined for the high end customers who yield for efficiency and accuracy on the fields. The EU production of tractors was 187,000 units, correspondent to a value of 9.4 billion euros (2014). Outside the EU, a major production site for tractors is the Minsk Tractor Works (Belarus) with a high market share in the neighbouring countries, especially within the Commonwealth of Independent States. The leading countries for tractor production in the EU are Germany and Italy (with John Deere, Case New Holland, AGCO and Same Deutz-Fahr being the major brands). Germany is also the major place for the manufacturing of harvesting, spraying, fertilizing and seeding equipment. Italy and France have a primary position for soil working machines and transportation vehicles. The majority of the agricultural machinery companies are small and medium-sized and family owned. One third of the EU production is destined to markets outside the union, mainly to the Eastern European markets, but also to North America and, increasingly, to Asia. After a peak in 2003 and 29 billion euros of turnover, the sector experienced an economic downturn in 2014/2015. The strategy of the European industry is to keep its leading technological position and to diversify its market presence into the high potential regions (e.g. Asia). = Agricultural machinery industry in North America = The AEM (2014) stated that \\"U.S. domestic sales of agricultural machinery and equipment rose from about $20 billion in 1999 to $38 billion in 2012.

According to news reports at the time, the 22-year-old Miss Markham was pronounced dead in Sprakers, New York on July 8, 1894, by a Dr. Howard, the family physician. Since the weather was quite warm, it was decided to have the burial quickly, and her coffin was closed and fastened after family members said goodbye on the morning of July 10. But on the way to the graveyard, the hearse was stopped after a noise was heard coming from the coffin. The lid was unfastened to find Miss Markham alive, exclaiming \\"You are burying me alive!,\\" to which Dr. Howard reportedly said, \\"Hush child, you are all right. It is a mistake easily rectified.\\" Markham soon after fainted, but recovered after being administered some stimulants. She stated that she had been conscious the entire time of the preparations for burial, but was unable to cry out.

Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, 323 U.S. 210 (1944), is a 1944 Supreme Court case. It involved a black man, Tom Tunstall, who was unfairly dismissed from his job because of his race. Background Plaintiff Tom Tunstall was a locomotive fireman, employed by the defendant company, Norfolk Southern Railway Company and its predecessor Norfolk Southern Railroad Company (both hereinafter called the Railway) on or prior to March 28, 1940. The plaintiff was rendered ineligible for membership in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen (hereinafter called the Brotherhood) solely because of his race. On or about March 28, 1940, the Brotherhood initiated negotiations with the defendant Railway and other carriers. As a result, there was a collective bargaining agreement dated February 18, 1941. And ever since the beginning of the negotiations with the Railway until the result of the collective bargaining agreement, the Brotherhood has claimed to be the exclusive bargaining representative under the Railway Labor Act 48 Stat. 1185, 45 U. S. C. ¬ß¬ß 151 et seq.,. Case summary page Logo of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, established in 1873, known as the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen from 1907. In other words, when a labor union is certified as bargaining agent under the Railway Labor Act, it becomes the exclusive bargaining representative for the entire craft or class of the employees. Consequently, minority members of the bargaining unit can neither choose another representative of their choice nor engage in individual, independent bargaining. This would then often lead to less power for them due to the fact that their interests would not be properly represented by the bargaining representative and thus they have no choice but to remain without proper representation. During the entire time under consideration in this case, the Brotherhood maintained that the employment rights of the plaintiff and the class represented by him are governed by the said collective bargaining agreement dated February 18, 1941. The Brotherhood initiated the negotiations without notifying the plaintiff, Tom Tunstall, or any other members of his class.Houston opposes review of Tom Tunstall's case. (December 13, 1947). Afro-American (1893-1988) Retrieved from The Railway and the other carriers protested against the negotiations proposed by the Brotherhood and the Brotherhood invoked the services of the National Mediation Board without giving notice of such action to the plaintiff or any other members of his class. Moreover, the Brotherhood did not notify the plaintiff or any other members of his class after the execution of the contracts that such agreements had been executed0 Plaintiff Tunstall claimed that he suffered because of the Brotherhood‚Äôs modifications to the collective bargaining agreement. As a result of the negotiations, Tunstall was deprived of his seniority and rights by being removed from his job as a fireman. Instead, he was assigned more difficult and arduous work at a lower wage and was replaced by a white member of the brotherhood. This situation left the black firemen and enginemen voiceless and thus powerless, basically unable to protect their rights. Therefore, the plaintiff brought suit for declaratory judgment, injunction, and damages on account of discriminatory contract in favor of white members and against black members of the craft. However, the Fourth Circuit at the Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case on the ground that the federal courts lacked the jurisdiction over the case. The plaintiff therefore appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal of the Circuit Court and granted a writ of certiorari. Opinion of the Court Mr. Charles H. Houston for plaintiff, Tom Tunstall. Mr. Harold C. Heiss for respondent, The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen. Chief Justice Stone delivered the opinion of the Court, which held that the Railway Labor Act imposed on unions a \\"duty to exercise fairly the power conferred upon it in [sic] behalf of all those for whom it acts, without hostile discrimination against them.\\"Steele v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., 323 U.S. 192, 203 (1944) The Court outlined the Railway Labor Act's duty in its Steele opinion, and adopted it by reference in Tunstall, dedicating the balance of the Tunstall opinion to discussing whether a class action for an injunction under the Act poses a federal question. Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen, 323 U.S. 210, 211-14 (1944) (answering the federal question issue in the affirmative). This duty defined by the Court required that the Brotherhood, as an exclusive bargaining agent, was required \\"in collective bargaining and in making contracts with the carrier, to represent non-union or minority union members of the craft without hostile discrimination, fairly, impartially, and in good faith.\\"Steele, 323 U.S. at 204. Although the Court never specifically stated the magic words, this good faith duty has become widely recognized as the \\"duty of fair representation.\\"Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen, 323 U.S. 210, 211-14 (1944) The Court opinion emphasized that it was especially concerned with the problem of economic hardships that would have resulted by the Railway Labor Act. The Court commented, \\"the minority would be left with no means of protecting their interests or, indeed, their right to earn a livelihood by pursuing the occupation in which they are employed.\\"Steele, 323 U.S. at 201. Justice Frank Murphy‚Äôs concurring opinion explicitly advocated the strength of Houston‚Äôs Realist arguments.Realist argument, as described by Professor Bell, was designed to work in such a manner by pointing judges towards the unique factual and ethical issues of each case, while overlaying the economic and political implications of the judge's decision. Bell, supra note 12, at 367. Justice Murphy commented that \\"the utter disregard for the dignity and the well-being of colored citizens shown by this record is so pronounced as to demand the invocation of constitutional condemnation.\\"Id. at 208 (Murphy, J., concurring). He did not hesitate to criticize the majority for failing to candidly confront the issues that Houston raised; \\"to decide the case and to analyze the statute solely upon the basis of legal niceties, while remaining mute and placid as to the obvious and oppressive deprivation of constitutional guarantees, is to make the judicial function something less than it should be.\\"Id. at 208 (Murphy, J., concurring). Justice Murphy even advocated that a clearer and stronger message be sent by the Court: No statutory interpretation can erase this ugly example of economic cruelty against colored citizens of the United States. Nothing can destroy the fact that the accident of birth has been used as the basis to abuse individual rights‚Ä¶ [a] sound democracy cannot allow such discrimination to go unchallenged. Racism is far too virulent today to permit the slightest refusal ‚Ä¶ to expose and condemn it wherever it appears in the course of a statutory interpretation.(n79 Id. at 209.) In conclusion, the Court announced that the duty of the certified collective bargaining agent to represent the members of unions fairly and without racial discrimination when negotiating a bargaining agreement was implicit in the Railway Labor Act.Black Labor and the American Legal System: Race, Work, and the Law, By Herbert Hill Therefore, the Court is of opinion that the record clearly demonstrates that the motion of the plaintiff for summary judgment should be granted and the motions of the defendants for summary judgments should be denied Legacy By winning this case before the US Supreme Court, Attorney Houston made a unique contribution for the rights of minorities in the area of labor law. The strategy of legal Realism implemented by Houston in this case, with analysis of the lasting ramifications emanating from, is worth noting. This case is one of many other cases within the larger history of civil rights Houston pursued in the courts. His involvement in the issues facing African-American union members began with the Colored Railway Trainmen and Locomotive Firemen‚Äôs Local No.5. The facts presented to him by Tunstall v. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen were \\"reflective of the ubiquity of discrimination\\" put against African Americans in unions.  See also  * Steele v.

The volume is dedicated \\"To the Memory of the Three Hundred Thousand Who in the War For the Maintenance of the Union Fell Devotedly Under the Flag of Their Fathers\\" and its 72 poems deal with the battles and personalities of the American Civil War and their aftermath. Also included are Notes and a Supplement in prose in which Melville sets forth his thoughts on how the Post-war Reconstruction should be carried out. Critics at the time were at best respectful and often sharply critical of Melville's unorthodox style. The book had sold only 486 copies by 1868 and recovered barely half of its publications costs. Not until the latter half of the twentieth century did Battle-Pieces become regarded as one of the most important group of poems on the Civil War. The poems and their background The book is Melville's return to poetry after a hiatus which began in 1860 when Harper & Brothers turned down a book of his poems, which is now lost. After moving his family from Massachusetts to New York in 1863, Melville contemplated writing a book of poems on the war, but evidently did not begin to do so until 1864.For details see Parker (2006) pp. 498 ff The book was not published until 1866, a year after the end of the war. The title refers to the familiar paintings by Dutch and British artists who depicted scenes of battle at sea and musical settings of these battles. Melville's major source for the poems were the early volumes of Frank Moore's (compiler) eleven-volume The Rebellion Record: A Diary of American Events, with Documents, Narratives, Illustrative Incidents, Poetry, Etc. (New York:G.P. Putnam, 1861-1868).Gale (1995), 31. Battle-Pieces is made up of 72 short lyric and narrative poems grouped into two sections. The first and longer sequence is centered on battles, but the emphasis is on taking stock of the results and on the personalities of the officers who led them. The second, shorter series is made up of elegies, epitaphs, and requiems. The opening poem is \\"The Portent\\", a meditation on the hanging of the abolitionist John Brown: :Hanging from the beam, :Slowly swaying (such the law), :Gaunt the shadow on your green, :Shenandoah! :The cut is on the crown :(Lo, John Brown), :And the stabs shall heal no more. :Hidden in the cap :Is the anguish none can draw; :So your future veils its face, :Shenandoah! :But the streaming beard is shown :(Weird John Brown), :The meteor of the war. Other poems include \\"A Requiem For Soldiers Lost In Ocean Transports\\", \\"The Martyr Indicative of the Passion of the People on the 15th of April 1865\\", \\"The Frenzy In The Wake Sherman's Advance Through The Carolinas\\", \\"The March To The Sea\\", \\"Look-Out Mountain The Night Fight\\", \\"Shiloh A Requiem\\", \\"A Utilitarian View Of The Monitor's Fight\\", \\"The Conflict Of Convictions\\" and \\"On the Slain at Chickamauga\\". In the prose \\"Supplement\\", Melville says that he is \\"one who never was a blind adherent\\" and advocates reconciliation with the South. He does not favor enfranchising former slaves immediately, for they are \\"in their infant pupilage to freedom\\" and argues that sympathy for them \\"should not be allowed to exclude kindliness to communities who stand closer to us in nature\\". He continues, \\"Let us be Christians toward our fellow-whites, we well as philanthropists toward the blacks, our fellow-men.\\" Lawrence Buell notes that Melville wrote from a Yankee viewpoint but that Battle-Pieces seldom voices jingoism or triumphalism. The Martyr \\"The Martyr\\" is Melville's reaction to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1866, one year after the event.Michael Paul Rogin Subversive Genealogy: The Politics and Art of Herman Melville, 1985. \\"He was, in American symbolic history, the lamb of God himself. The \\"parricides\\" who killed Abraham Lincoln, in Melville's poem, \\"The Martyr\\", transformed him into Christ. Melville's prose note to \\"The Martyr\\" described the poem as \\"indicative of\\" Melville praises Lincoln in Christ-like terms calling him \\"the Forgiver\\", but predicts that his assassination will cause the forgiver to be replaced by the avenger.Robert L. Gale, A Herman Melville Encyclopedia, 1995 page 245. \\"Melville in his poem \\"The Martyr\\" praises Lincoln, whom he calls \\"the Forgiver\\", as a kind, calm, clement leader. But the poet predicts that Lincoln's assassination will cause the avenger to replace the forgiver.\\"  Prose Supplement  The Supplement in prose is Melville's meditation on the period after the Civil War, now known as the Reconstruction Era. As the scholar Robert L. Gale summarizes, \\"Melville urges Christian charity and common sense with respect to Reconstruction efforts, a wide and humane patriotism, an awareness that victory came to the North not by greater heroism but because of greater resources and population, sympathy for the liberated slaves, and decency in Congress.\\"Gale (1995), p. 31. Critical response Contemporary review in the Indianapolis Daily Journal The initial reception in the major journals was sympathetic but not entirely approving. Richard Henry Stoddard, for instance, wrote :The habit of his mind is not lyric, but historical, and the genre of historic poetry in which he most congenially expatiates finds rhythm not a help but a hindrance. The exigencies of rhyme hamper him still more, and against both of these trammels his vigorous thought habitually recalcitrates.... That it is not the nature of his thought which is at fault, may be plainly perceived from multitudes of strong and beautiful images, many thoughts picturesquely put, which, belonging legitimately to the poetic domain, still refuse to obey the rigid regimental order of the stanza, but outly its lines, deployed as irregular, though brilliant skirmishers.... Stoddard also found it :a book which, without having one poem of entire artistic ensemble in it, possesses numerous passages of beauty and power. For these it is well worth going through, and belongs, at any rate, to a place on the shelves of those who are collecting the literature of the war, as well as of that much larger class who would not be without a book of Typee's gifted author.New York World (October 19, 1866) quoted in The Life and Works of Herman Melville More recent critics praise Melville's poetry in general and Battle-Pieces in particular. Lawrence Buell writes that, next to Walt Whitman, Melville wrote the best series of Civil War lyrics. Editions * foreword by James M. McPherson; introduction by Richard H. Cox and Paul M.

Early life and career Yves was born and raised in Jaro, Iloilo City. A pick-up from the Visayan cage recruit. His first taste of competitive basketball was when he participated in a community tournament. After doing time with a Chinese high school, the 6-4 slotman transferred to the West Negros College in Bacolod. Even though he was only in High School, Yves showed a brand of play good enough to earn him a slot with the Western Visayas Regional Athletic Association selection (Region VI) that participated in the 1983 Palarong Pambansa held in Tacloban, Leyte. It was playing against the De La Salle team that coach Pilo Pumaren and \\"Boss Henry\\" Cojuangco spotted him and marked him down as a possible De La Salle recruit. In May of that same year, Yves was transported to the mainland to take part in the first-ever PABL tournament as a Taft-based Green Archer. A month later, he joined the training camp of Ron Jacobs with the aspirations of making it with the RP squad to be sent to Hong Kong ABC. Unfortunately, coach Jacobs felt that Yves was still too raw to meet the demands of a tough tournament and was cut from the final selection. In early 1984, when the call for national team aspirants to the Asian Youth tournament was announced, Yves pounced on the opportunity to sharpen his skills. He passed the requirements and underwent rigid preparations for the biennial competitions. Together with Negrense buddy, Naning Valenciano, they helped steer the RP squad to a third-place finish in Seoul, Korea. By that time, the Northern Consolidated contingent of Ron Jacobs was already showing a lot of muscle in the PBA. Professional career With his good looks, Dignadice became an instant darling amongst female basketball fans. But on the court, this basketball adonis was an exceptional defensive player. With his long arms and quick feet, Dignadice could guard all five positions and was a terror when it came to protecting the paint, always forcing his opponents to take awkward shots. His defensive capabilities gave him three All-Star invites and, more importantly, inclusion in the first ever national basketball team composed of PBA players in 1990, purportedly as coach Robert Jaworski's personal choice. He was also an integral part of the San Miguel franchise‚Äôs Grand Slam run in 1989. His stock fell off the grid as the 90s came because of various injuries. Also, unlike contemporary Jerry Codi√±era, he never really had a firm grasp on the starting PF/C spot, and it didn't help him that he had the more illustrious Ramon Fernandez as his teammate and the team's main man. He was the last part of the Grand Slam squad to leave the Beermen when he was assigned to Ginebra a year before his eventual retirement.http://www.sydrified.org/2014/03/the-sydrified-special-san-miguel- beer.html After his retirement, he left the Philippines and is currently residing in the US.https://m.facebook.com/YvesAD12 International career Dignadice was a member of two Philippine national teams: the first one was with the NCC-backed national team that won the gold medal during the 1985 ABC Championship (now FIBA Asia) in Kuala Lumpur, and second with the all-pro Philippine squad that won silver during the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing.

Rather than a traditional circular shape, the Shark Wheel is composed of one or many three-dimensional sine waves. The shape is a hybrid of a sphere and cube, taking on the properties of both shapes while in motion. It has been touted as the reinvention of the wheel by various news outlets. The wheels were funded by a Kickstarter campaign that reached nearly eight times its initial goal. It attracted the attention of award-winning skateboarder Tony Hawk and was used by skateboarders who placed in various competitions around the world. The product appeared on ABC's Shark Tank in May 2015. Inventor The shape of Shark Wheels came to David Patrick while he was designing an alternating wake turbine that was a spinoff from his research. The sine wave design that Patrick's research came up with worked well for the turbine (which Patrick says also has potential uses in wind, water, and other forms of renewable energy generation). Patrick's work has led to support from the LA Cleantech Incubator and the formation of 4sphere, his renewable energy solutions company. The shape of the Shark Wheel was intended for use as the four component pieces of the turbine (and its shape is in current use). When the Shark Wheel shape was accidentally dropped, it rolled. The wheels appear to be square, but roll smoothly like conventional wheels. Its single or multiple interlocking rings are based on sine wave patterns, which create a thinner contact patch with the pavement compared to a conventional wheel of the same width. The company claims that this design offers less rolling resistance and a faster ride. The company also claims the design has properties of thin and wide wheels, depending on the terrain (on hard surfaces it operates like a thin wheel with low friction and on soft terrain it produces the contact patch of a wide wheel). The shape of the wheel resembles a shark's jaw which Patrick says gave the product and the company their names. Application Shark Wheel for skateboard applications. Shark Wheel says its skateboard wheel design gives it better maneuverability over debris, water and other conditions that deteriorate the performance of conventional wheels. According to a Future Tech segment in the Discovery Channel's Daily Planet series, the thinner contact patch from the three strips gave a faster ride, less rolling resistance while cutting a path through dirt, sand and water which also reduces hydroplaning (as opposed to traditional skateboard wheels which \\"steamroll\\" over obstacles) Skateboarder Tony Hawk said he saw how the wheels could be very functional, especially downhill. Patrick funded Shark Wheels‚Äô initial design and manufacturing though a Kickstarter campaign in the summer of 2013. Though the initial goal was $10,000, it closed with close to $80,000 pledges from 1,094 backers, delivering over 1,000 sets of wheels. There was also preorder available on Shark Wheel website up to April 2014. Skateboarder Eric Palmer, using Shark Wheels, placed No. 4 in the Miami Ultraskate 2014, and No. 3 in the Broad Street Bomb in Philadelphia; Casper Grette of the uGGa buGGa crew also placed No. 1 in the Kongsberg Downhill in Norway 2014 using the wheels. The wheels have applications where an upright wheel would usually be used. Future potential applications the company mentioned include luggage wheels, roller skates and scooters, as well as many other transportation-related and industrial applications.

The Tyee, May 23, 2015. He has recorded both as a solo artist, and as a member of several bands, including The Cordells, and Red Cedar, with Morley Loon. Thrasher has advocated for Inuit and First Nations issues for much of his career.  Early life  Thrasher was born in 1948, in Aklavik. He was born into the traditional Inuit hunting culture of the western Arctic; his father was a whaler and hunter. At age five, he was removed from his family and placed in the Canadian government's residential school system. In Aklavik, he attended the Immaculate Conception and Grollier Hall Residential Schools until he was sixteen., where he learned to play drums on a kit in the gym. After leaving school, he worked as a forest firefighter in Whitehorse, and began playing in rock groups. A fan of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr, Thrasher formed a band called the Cordells with his brother and friends.  Music career  The Cordells toured northern Canada in the late 1960s and early 1970s, playing schools and community halls. Based out of Inuvik, they were considered the town's first rock and roll band, and played mostly contemporary songs and covers. After a show in the mid-1970s, Thrasher was approached by an elderly man and challenged as to why he didn't play music that reflected his Inuit heritage. From that point, Thrasher moved into more personal songwriting and began studying Inuit music. After this change in style, Thrasher joined Canadian artists such as Buffy Sainte-Marie and Willie Dunn in exploring their Inuit and First Nations roots in the mid-1970s, and speaking out on political issues. Thrasher toured heavily in this period, and suffered from alcoholism. In the early 1980s, Thrasher made two recordings with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Northern Service: Spirit Child, a full-length studio album of original songs, and Sweet Grass, a live recording in Val-d'Or, Quebec, with fellow First Nations musicians Willy Mitchell, Morley Loon, and Roger House. Thrasher joined Morley Loon as part of his Vancouver-based Red Cedar group in the 1980s. In 1990, Thrasher participated in the Odeyak expedition, where Cree and Inuit leaders paddled from Quebec to New York City. A song composed by Thrasher was performed in Times Square by the group. In 1998, Thrasher performed as part of a revival of traditional potlach ceremonies organised by Commissioner of the Yukon Judy Gingell in Whitehorse. His songs \\"Spirit Child\\", \\"Old Man Carver\\" and \\"We Got to Take You Higher\\" are featured on the 2014 compilation album Native North America, Vol. 1.\\"Light in the Attic Unearths the Forgotten History of First Nations Music with 'Native North America' Compilation\\". Exclaim!, October 8, 2014.

He was also known by his courtesy name Zijian (). He was known as a capable governor and was also a writer. Life According to the Records of the Grand Historian, Fu Buqi (Zijian) was born in 521 BC, 30 years younger than Confucius, He was from the State of Lu, Confucius' native state. Fu Buqi served as magistrate of Shanfu County (present-day Shan County, Shandong) in Lu, and governed the county well without putting in much effort. Wuma Shi, another disciple of Confucius, had served in the same position and succeeded only with very hard work. Wuma asked Fu Buqi how he managed it so easily, Fu replied: \\"I employ men; you employ men's strength.\\" Several ancient texts, including the Records of the Grand Historian, the L√ºshi Chunqiu, and the Han Shi Waizhuan, record anecdotes demonstrating Fu Buqi's good governance. Confucius praised Fu Buqi's governing ability, and thought he was fit for higher positions such as a king's or lord's adviser. In the Analects, Confucius called Fu Buqi a junzi (gentleman), and cited him as evidence of the high moral standard of the people of Lu. Throughout the Analects, Confucius praised only two of his disciples as junzi, the other being Nangong Kuo. Fu Buqi was also a writer. His works were still extant during the late Western Han dynasty, and were included in Liu Xin's (50 BC ‚Äì 23 AD) catalogue Qil√ºe (‰∏ÉÁï•). According to the Yanshi Jiaxun, Fu Sheng, the prominent Qin and Han dynasty scholar, was a descendant of Fu Buqi. Honours In Confucian temples, Fu Buqi's spirit tablet is placed in the outer court, beyond those of the Four Assessors and Twelve Wise Ones. During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong posthumously awarded Fu Buqi the nobility title of Count of Shan (ÂñÆ‰ºØ). During the Song dynasty, he was further awarded the title of Marquis of Shanfu (ÂñÆÁà∂‰æØ).

She took on several high-profile roles in the capital of South Australia, Adelaide and was President of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) of South Australia, one of the most prominent organisations in the successful campaigns which made South Australia the first of the Australian colonies to grant women the right to vote in 1894.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/nicholls-elizabeth-webb-7839 Background Nicholls was born on 21 February 1850 in Rundle Street, Adelaide to parents Samuel Bakewell, grocer, and his wife Mary Ann, n√©e Pye. Following her mother's death when she was just three years old, Nicholls spent some years living with relatives in England before returning to Adelaide. Her father remarried, his new spouse being Mary Ann's sister Eliza Hannah. Nicholls herself married warehouseman Alfred Richard Nicholls on 2 August 1870, having one daughter and four sons as well as taking in two orphaned relatives who they also raised in their household. As a young woman Nicholls is quoted as saying I long to have the will and the power to be very useful. Her father Samuel and her uncle William both became members of the South Australian House of Assembly, providing her with some background in local politics. An active member of the Archer Street Wesleyan church in North Adelaide, Nicholls taught Sunday School and distributed religious tracts.Jones, Helen 1986. 'In Her Own Name: A history of women in South Australia from 1836' Wakefield Press: Adelaide Nicholls was said to be \\"short in stature, with a benign expression, she was a pleasant, unself-conscious speaker and quickly earned her members' approval for her efficiency and enthusiasm\\",Jones, Helen 1986. 'In Her Own Name: A history of women in South Australia from 1836' Wakefield Press: Adelaide, p. 97 Nicholls was described as being \\"prone to chafe quietly at 'unreasonable restraint'\\" Woman's Christian Temperance Union In July 1886, three months after its formation, Nicholls joined the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of South Australia. Becoming heavily involved in 1888, Nicholls became the provisional president of the Adelaide branch late that year and was elected colonial president in 1889, holding the position until 1897. In 1891 Nicholls became one of the first women admitted to the South Australian Temperance Alliance. Nicholls founded the WCTU's journal Our Federation and was its editor from 1898 to 1904 when it ceased. Women's Suffrage Nicholls reinvigorated the WCTU's suffrage work and encouraged women to write to their local Member of Parliament. She invested large amounts of effort in educating women on their political potential, speaking in numerous places on the basics of enrolling and voting, using her 'Platform of Principles'. Nicholls joined the Women's Suffrage League of South Australia and subsequently became a League Councillor. In 1894 she assumed the role of Colonial Superintendent of the WCTU's Suffrage Department. Nicholls helped to gather 8,268 of the 11,600 signatures for the 1894 suffrage petition to the South Australian Parliament. Later life c.1919 Nicholls was an appointed member of the Adelaide Hospital Board from 1895 to 1922 and was one of the first four female Justices of the Peace appointed in 1915 and would often sit on the Children's Court. Nicholls advocated for similar female appointments in other Australian States and argued for prison reform. She also sought the improvement of conditions and wages for working women which led to her becoming a shareholder of the women's South Australian Co-operative Clothing Co. From 1909 Nicholls was a member of the Women's Non-Party Political Association, becoming its president in 1911. She remained passionate about women's suffrage and was elected vice- president of the League of Women Voters and attended the 10th World Convention of the International Women's Suffrage Alliance at Geneva in 1920. In 1921 she helped found the Australian Federation of Women Voters and lobbied the League of Nations (now the United Nations) on behalf of Australian women. Nicholls remained committed to the WCTU throughout her life and was involved in successful referendum of hotel closing hours which resulted in the imposition of a 6pm closing time in 1915. She justified all reforms on the grounds of temperance and social purity. Her husband, who had worked 55 years with G. & R. Wills & Co., died on 11 November 1920. Nicholls moved into Willard House, the WCTU Adelaide headquarters and residence on Wakefield Street near Francis Xavier's Cathedral. She died at North Adelaide on 3 August 1943 and is buried in Payneham cemetery, South Australia.

(Note: this gives Dashwood's birth year incorrectly as 1826.) Goldie was born in Paris, France and baptised on 25 April 1825 in St Marylebone Parish Church, London. He was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge in 1843. Goldie graduated from Cambridge University in 1847 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and was ordained as a priest in the Church of England. He was priest in charge at High Toynton, Lincolnshire in 1851 and then from 1852 to 1866 he had the same position at St Thomas's Church, Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire. He was vicar of St Ives (then in Huntingdonshire) from 1866 until his death there in 1886. Goldie's tenure at St Ives was controversial and his \\"ritualistic proceedings\\" alienated many of the congregation; he also attempted to impose church rates and was consistently and successfully opposed on that and on his candidates for the post of churchwarden in \\"stormy\\" parish meetings that attracted hundreds of people. Goldie's first-class cricket career was accidental. In the 1846 University Match between Cambridge University and Oxford University, held at Oxford, the Cambridge batsman John Walker did not appear for the match; the Cambridge team batted one man short in the first innings, but Goldie was co-opted to bat at No 11 in the second innings, and scored one run.Note: the www.cricketarchive.com scorecard indicates that it was Goldie who was absent in the first innings, but the contemporary report here shows that Walker was the missing Cambridge batsman. Goldie married Harriet Nicol, the daughter of a Bengal Army colonel, in 1848; among their children was John Goldie, who won fame in rowing at Cambridge and at Henley and after whom the Goldie second string Cambridge University rowing team is named.
