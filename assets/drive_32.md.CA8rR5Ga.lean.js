Hobbs, 574 U.S. ___ (2015), was an American legal case in which the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that an Arkansas prison policy which prohibited a Muslim prisoner from growing a short beard in accordance with his religious beliefs violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). Background Gregory Holt (also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad) was a prisoner in the Arkansas Department of Corrections. Holt was also a devout Muslim who believed, based on hadith, that his faith obliged him to leave his beard entirely uncut. However, Arkansas policy prohibited inmates to grow any beards (except to a length of a quarter inch when medically required). Holt requested an exemption from the no-beards policy through the prison grievance process. Based upon a case ordering California officials to allow Muslim prisoners to grow a half-inch beard, Holt requested permission to grow a half-inch beard only, as a \\"compromise\\". His request was rejected. In lower courts Holt then filed a motion in court to require Arkansas allow him to grow a half-inch beard, arguing that he deserved an exception under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. He argued pro se that he was entitled to an exemption because Arkansas's policy was not, as required under RLUIPA, the \\"least restrictive means\\" for Arkansas to further its interests. The magistrate initially recommended the motion be denied, but the District Court temporarily granted his request and sent the matter back to the magistrate for a hearing. At the hearing, Holt testified that it was impossible to hide anything in his beard. Two prison officials testified in response that inmates could hide contraband in half-inch beards, that an escaped prisoner with a beard could change his appearance by shaving his beard, and that it would be difficult to consistently measure half-inch beards. The magistrate ultimately deferred to the judgment of the prison officials, relying on Eighth Circuit precedent, and recommended that Holt's motion be denied. The District Court adopted the magistrate's recommendations, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed. Holt then filed a pro se petition for a writ of certiorari and a request to proceed in forma pauperis. On March 3, 2014, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Supreme Court decision The majority opinion written by Alito said that RLUIPA does not require a prison to grant religious exemptions simply because a prisoner asks or because other prisons do.. However, Arkansas officials offered no evidence that a short beard presented security risks or could serve as a hiding place for contraband, as the officials argued. Arkansas had not overcome the high hurdles set by the law: that policymakers may not burden a person‚Äôs exercise of religion unless they can show a compelling governmental interest and that the policy was the least-restrictive means of achieving that goal. In a concurrence, Justice Ginsburg, contrasting the case with Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, said accommodating Holt‚Äôs request \\"would not detrimentally affect others who do not share petitioner‚Äôs belief.\\" In a separate concurrence, Justice Sotomayor disagreed with the majority's application of RLUIPA, but did agree that Arkansas officials did not adequately respond to Holt's request to keep a beard.

Between 1965 and 1987 the abortion rate used to be very high (between 20 and 28%). Since independence, the abortion rate has almost halved and relatively stabilized after 2000 (between 12 and 14%). In the 2014, 13.8% of pregnancies in Azerbaijan ended in abortion, a slight rise from the all-time low recorded in 2005 (12.1%).  History  As in all of the former USSR, Azerbaijan, known prior to 1992 as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, was subject to the abortion legislation and regulations of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. As a result, abortion practices in Azerbaijan were similar to those throughout the former USSR. The description given below pertains to the situation in Azerbaijan prior to independence. Since independence no changes have been made in the abortion law. The Soviet Decree of 27 June 1936 prohibited the performance of abortions except in the case of a danger to life, a serious threat to health, or the existence of a serious disease that could be inherited from the parents. The abortion had to be performed in a hospital or maternity home. Physicians who performed unsafe abortions outside a hospital or without the presence of one of these indications were subject to one to two years' imprisonment. If the abortion was performed under unsanitary conditions or by a person with no special medical education, the penalty was no less than three years' imprisonment. A person who induced a woman to have an abortion was subject to two years' imprisonment. A pregnant woman who underwent an abortion was subject to a reprimand and the payment of a fine of up to 300 rubles in the case of a repeat offence. In an edict of 23 November 1955, the government of the former USSR repealed the general prohibition on the performance of abortions contained in the 1936 Decree. Other regulations, also issued in 1955, specified that abortions could be performed freely during the first twelve weeks of pregnancy, if no contraindication existed, and after that point, when the continuance of the pregnancy and the birth would harm the mother (interpreted to include foetal handicap). The abortion had to be performed in a hospital by a physician and, unless the mother's health was threatened, a fee was charged. Persons who performed an abortion illegally were subject to criminal penalties established by criminal laws such as the Soviet Criminal Code. For example, if the abortion was not performed in a hospital, a penalty of up to one year's imprisonment could be imposed, and if it was performed by a person without an advanced medical degree, a penalty of up to two years' imprisonment was possible. In the case of repeat offences or the death or serious injury of the pregnant woman, a higher penalty of up to eight years' imprisonment could be imposed. A woman who underwent an illegal abortion was not penalized. Despite the approval of the 1955 edict and regulations, the problem of illegal abortions did not entirely disappear in the former USSR. This situation resulted in part from the government's conflicted attitude towards contraception. Although at times it manifested support for contraception, it did little to make contraception available and in 1974 effectively banned the widespread use of oral contraceptives. The situation was also due in part to a revived pronatalist approach to childbearing adopted at times by the government, which looked unfavourably on abortion. The result was a reliance on abortion as the primary method of family planning. Concerned with the high rate of illegal abortions, in 1982 the government issued a decree allowing abortions for health reasons to be performed through the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy. The government continued to extend the circumstances under which legal abortions were available, and on 31 December 1987 it issued another decree setting out a broad range of non-medical indications for abortions performed on request through the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy. These were: the death of the husband during pregnancy; imprisonment of the pregnant woman or her husband; deprivation of maternity rights; multiparity (the number of children exceeds five); divorce during pregnancy; pregnancy following rape; and child disability in the family. Moreover, the order provided that, with the approval of a commission, an abortion could performed on any other ground. This extension of the grounds for abortion after the first twelve weeks of pregnancy, combined with the ambivalent attitude of the government towards contraception, led to a dramatic increase in the number of officially reported abortions. Other factors resulting in a high incidence of abortion have included shortages of high-quality modern contraceptives and reliance upon less dependable traditional methods; a lack of knowledge among couples of contraception and of the detrimental health consequences of frequent abortions; and the absence of adequate training for physicians, nurses, teachers and other specialists. In 1989, the availability of condoms in the entire former USSR amounted to only 11 per cent of demand; intrauterine devices (IUDs), 30 per cent; and pills, 2 per cent. Data from the 1990 all- union sample survey of contraceptive use indicate that, in Azerbaijan, 6.5 per cent of all women aged 15‚Äì49 years regularly used contraception, 10.1 per cent sometimes used contraception, 41.9 per cent did not use any contraceptive method and 35.3 per cent knew nothing about contraception.

Not only wouldn't the local school board make space available, they wouldn't even sign a general letter of support for the idea of an integrated party. Potter described Mareshia as coming from a strong family, still considered newcomers to rural Rochelle, Georgia, even though her grandmother moved her family there decades ago.

He worked with the band Chicago, Yanni and Manhattan Transfer as well as the Bee Gees. Biography Michael J. Murphy was born in 1946 in Aurora, Illinois, the son of Jim and Mary Murphy. He began making music as a youngster with his father's band. During high school he was a drummer in the Vaqueros Drum and Bugle Corps. The Vaqueros disbanded in 1963 but he was a major influence in their drum section. He was in the band at East Aurora High School and was a quarterback on their football team, graduating in 1964. After a year at Doan College in Nebraska, he joined the U.S. Navy and served as an instructor in the Navy School of Music. He returned to Aurora in the early 70's and became an instructor at the Fox Valley Raiders Drum And Bugle Corps and was on their board of directors https://www.facebook.com/105414373960/photos/a.10154815253883961.1073741827.105414373960/10154815254328961/?type=3&theater; He also played drums in the Ambassadors Band which included Bill Mickelberg (top, center) and Andy Waterman (on right) on guitar, Dick Jess on trombone, Mike on drums and Don Markese on the Sax. Career He then became a professional musician in both Chicago and Los Angeles as a studio drummer, jingle producer, educator, live performer, and manufacturer, serving as Operations Director for DW drums. He toured five years with the Grammy Award- winning band Chicago as a drum and computer technician, bridging the gap into digital technology, developing protocol for use of sequencing in live performance; executing the same for Yanni and Manhattan Transfer. Bee Gees In 1989, Mike became the drummer for the multi-award-winning Bee Gees, supporting their 1989 One for All World Tour after Chester Thompson left before the Gibb Brothers performed their One concert in St. Paul, Minnesota promoting their album One. They performed on four continents for a total of twenty-five concerts (eleven in Europe, six in Australia, two in Japan, and six in the U.S. He also performed with them on their four-CD box set, Tales from the Brothers Gibb. He appears on the \\"One for All Tour concert film\\". He later married one of the backing vocalists/percussionists from the Bee Gees' One For All tour, Tampa Lann. He continued to live in California for many years. Murphy with the Bee Gees in 1989 Murphy also recorded additional drums with the Bee Gees on their 1992 American hit single \\"When He's Gone\\" wherein future Eagles backup drummer and percussionist Scott Crago played the mainline drums. Trevor Murrell became the Bee Gees' drummer in 1992. Post-Bee Gees As a devoted husband, Mike moved to Cleveland, Ohio in 1994, to support his wife as caregiver for her Alzheimer-stricken mom. With his vast industry experience, he became a successful custom integrator of audio, video, lighting, and security systems for many elegant northeast Ohio homes, as well as sound reinforcement for concert halls, stadiums, arenas, museums, medical facilities, and many local churches, including Parkside Church and his own Hudson Community Chapel. As a religious person, Mike professed faith in Jesus Christ and used his talents, with excellence and joy, to lead others into worship every Sunday from behind the church's drum set. His wife Tampa was also the church's pianist, choir director and chief singer. Mike also worked as a project manager and professional audio and systems integration engineer for the prestigious NETEAM AVI before retiring from the same company to begin a full-time ministry position as director of media and production at his local church. Death Mike succumbed to a lung complication on April 11, 2006 at the age of 60.\\"Former Bee Gees drummer died\\", We are One, Online Newsmagazine, News, April 24, 2006. Retrieved on 1 December 2014.

The nonlinearity of the convection term is the main problem in solving a stationary or nonstationary Navier-Stokes equation or Euler equation problems. Stoke incorporated ‚Äòthe method of artificial compressibility‚Äô to solve these problems. Navier-Stokes equation \\\\rho \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot abla \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right) = - abla p + \\\\mu abla^2 \\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{f}. Stokes approximation The Stokes approximation is developed from the Navier-Stokes equations by omission of the convective term. For small Reynolds numbers in the incompressible flow, this approximation is more useful. Then incompressible Navier Stokes equation can be written as- R_e. \\\\partial_t \\\\tilde{u} + R_e . \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\tilde{u}, \\\\tilde{ abla} \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\tilde{u}+R_e. abla\\\\tilde{p}-\\\\tilde{\\\\Delta}\\\\tilde{u} = 0 . Here linear diffusion term dominates the convection term. In the stationary problem neglecting the convection term, we get- R_e . abla p -\\\\Delta u = 0 Many theorems can be proved by using this process. The main problem with the solution of the incompressible flow equation is the decoupling of the continuity and momentum equation due to the absence of pressure or density term. Chorin proposed the solution for this problem of the pressure decoupling; this approach is called artificial compressibility. \\\\partial_t\\\\psi-L[\\\\psi] = 0 where \\\\psi = (u_1,u_2,u_3,p)^T In the above equation stoke assume that at, non-stationary Navier Stokes problem converge towards the solution of the correspondent stationary problem. This solution will not depend upon the function . If this is used for the above equation consisting of Navier stokes equation and continuity equations with time derivative of pressure, then the solution will be same as the stationary solution of the original Navier Stoke problem. This process also introduce the new term artificial time as t‚Üí‚àû. Artificial compressibility method is combined with a dual time stepping procedure which involves iteration in pseudo-time within each physical time step. This guarantees a convergence towards the solution for the incompressible flow problem.

They are in the family Pupinidae, superfamily Cyclophoroidea. This genus of land snails is endemic to Indochina. Like other pupinid snails, the shells of these snails are shaped like insect pupae. The shells are however characteristically large, up to , in contrast to other pupinids, many of which are considerably smaller. The soft parts of species in this genus are yellowish to pale orange in color, and their shells can range in color from black or yellowish to bright orange. These snails feed on decaying organic matter on forest floors. Taxonomy Pollicaria belongs to the family Pupinidae of the superfamily Cyclophoroidea.

The shells possess a shallow angled groove at the rear which functions as a breathing device. They range in color from monochrome black or yellowish to bright orange The body is yellowish to pale orange. Patches of dark-brown to black spots may be found scattered on the head and on the upper surfaces of the muscular foot. The head contains darker orange tentacles with dark eye spots on the outer base. The foot is broad and short. The operculum is attached to the rear top part of the foot. Elephant pupinid snails are dioecious (having separate male and female sexes). Males have a cone-shaped external penis on the right side of their body which will broaden and enlarge during mating season. Females also have a genital groove on the right side of their body. Distribution and habitat Elephant pupinid snails are endemic to tropical forests in Indochina. They are present in Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. They are commonly found in abundant numbers under the leaf litter of forests near limestone outcroppings. Ecology Like other pupinids, elephant pupinid snails are important decomposers, feeding on decaying organic matter under leaf litter on the forest floor.

The Maritime Heritage Project; Ships arriving at the Port of San Francisco; Arrivals 1852 from maritimeheritage.org, accessed November 30, 2014 The Capacity under Captain Driscoll, subsequently was hired by Captain James Turnbull to carry a cargo of U. S. Army supplies for Fort Yuma. It would also carry the engine, boiler and wood to assemble the side-wheel paddle steamer tug, Uncle Sam to the Colorado River Delta. The Uncle Sam would be the first of many steamboats on the Colorado River. After arriving in early September, the Capacity then had to wait longer than expected, over two months, in the anchorage in the estuary of the river until the Uncle Sam was built and launched in mid-November and then again waited four more months to empty its hold of the Army supplies. The anchorage was a trial for a ship anchored in that location, subject to extreme tides that left the ship stranded at low tide and struck by a 4 to 6 foot tidal bore when the tide came back in twice a day. The long wait was due to the limited 35 ton cargo capacity and the weakness of the 20hp engine of the tug when pitted against the strong down stream current of the Colorado, that made a round trip to and from its destination at Fort Yuma take 12 days each. The Capacity was successfully unloaded and left the river.Richard E.

It is the eleventh volume in his extensive Dray Prescot series of sword and planet novels, set on the fictional world of Kregen, a planet of the Antares star system in the constellation of Scorpio. It was first published by DAW Books in 1976. The Dray Prescot series is made of several cycles of novels, each cycle essentially forming a series within the series. In addition to being the eleventh volume in the series as a whole, Armada of Antares is also the last of six volumes in the Havilfar Cycle. It is set on the fictional continent of Havilfar as well as the islands of Pandahem and Valka. The 52 completed novels of the Dray Prescot series were written by Bulmer between 1972 and 1997, when a stroke stopped his writing, also the later Dray Prescot books, after 1988, were originally only published in German. The series is in the spirit of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter of Mars series.Ken Bulmer obituary The Guardian, published: 22 December 2005, accessed: 2 December 2014 Plot summary The book continues on from Avenger of Antares with Prescot being at home in his fortress in Valka with his wife and children. Attacked by four assassins in his own garden he defeats them and captures one but the latter is himself assassinated before he can talk. Employing the help of Evold Scavander, a wise man of Valka Prescot persuades the research into the contents of the two boxes in the flying boats which cause them to fly and makes some progress. When a merchant ship from Pandahem is captured Prescot learns that Vitridia, the female pirate he once served with in Swordships of Scorpio is still alive and active but that the fight against Hamal is becoming ever more desperate. Prescot and the Emperor raise an army of 15,000 as an assistance force to help the nations of Pandahem. He parts from Delia, now pregnant with their second set of twins and heads for Tomboram to assist Kov Pando. At the Battle of Tomor Peak Prescot's army defeats a 20,000-strong Hamalian force. He encounters Pando and his mother Tilda after the battle but is not recognised by them. During the night he accidentally walks into Rees who was captured during the battle and is now escaping. In his identity of Hamun Prescot joins Rees and they reach the Hamalian lines. From there Prescot, Rees and Chido return to Ruathytu. In a tavern in the capital the three watch a fight between Apims, humans, and Diffs, the non-human races of Kregen and see a stranger arrive and turn the battle for the humans. Prescot recognises him as an agent of the Savanti and learns that they are called Savapim. He befriends the Savapim, another Earth man, making him believe that Prescot is one of theirs. Prescot learns a number of things without disclosing his own origins, story and name. Prescot volunteers to deliver a letter for a cousin of Chido's to the Volgendrin, hoping to find further information there on the flying boats and unawares of what the Volgendrin really are. He learns that they are flying islands when he accidentally jumps over the edge and is barely rescued. He learns more about the purpose of the Volgendrin but than, ready to depart, is recognised by Ornol ham Feoste, Kov of Apulad, as Chaadur who the former blames for the murder of his wife. Prescot attempts to deny his former identity but is forced to fight and flee. He temporarily escapes but is than captured and eventually taken for trial to Ruathytu. Condemned to death and torture Prescot is spared when he is recognised by the former Kov of Falinur, Naghan Furtway. Instead he is taken to the Queen who decides to drag him through the streets during her coronation parade as Empress, tied to a Calsany, a donkey-like animal. Back in the dungeons Prescot is freed by the Kataki Strom Rosil, under orders of Phu- si-Yantong. Prescot soon overpowers the Katakis but spares Rosil who escapes and the former heads off towards Vallia. Prescot assembles his new air armada of flying ships and heads for Jholaix in north Western Pandahem, the last area not yet conquered by Hamal and still held by Prescot's expeditionary force. In the following Battle of Jholaix Prescot's forces are successful in defeating Hamal and freeing Pandahem. A peace treaty is hinted at and Prescot returns home to Valka and Delia.

It is installed in Washington Park in Portland, Oregon, United States. The fountain's name derives from the sound made when water drips from the upper basin. Staehli designed the fountain to serve as a watering trough for horses pulling carriages into the park. Based on a Renaissance fountain, it was originally painted white and included a statuette of a boy, possibly depicting Cupid, though the figure was damaged and permanently removed from the sculpture before or during the 1940s. The fountain was restored in 1960, but no longer functioned. Its condition was deemed \\"treatment urgent\\" by the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\\" program in February 1994. Since then, its water-pumping function has also been restored. Chiming Fountain has been included in published biking and walking tours of Portland and has been mentioned as a highlight of Washington Park in guides recommending family-friendly activities in the city. Description and history The decorative fountain is located at the junction of Southwest Sacajawea Boulevard and Southwest Sherwood Boulevard in the main circle of Washington Park. It was designed by John \\"Hans\\" Staehli, a woodcarver from Switzerland who immigrated to Portland and was known for his decorative carvings of churches. The fountain was commissioned by the city in 1891 for $400 and completed by Staehli later that year, becoming the city's second piece of public art. It served as a watering trough for horses pulling carriages into the park.Sybilla Avery Cook: * * The fountain has been given many different names, but is most commonly referred to as Chiming Fountain, in reference to the sound made by water dripping from the upper basin. Detail of the horned gargoyle-like figures The fountain is made of cast iron and measures approximately tall with a diameter. It has a pedestal and two round bronze basins separated by a narrow post, and stands in an octagonal concrete base which served as a retaining pool. The pedestal has four horned gargoyle- like figures. On the bottom of the pedestal's west side is an unsigned inscription which reads: \\"J. Staehli/Portland, Org./64 Second St.\\" Staehli's design is based on a Renaissance fountain and was originally painted white. The central post originally held a figure of a boy carrying a staff (or possibly a fish or a torch) from which water spouted. Some sources suggest the figure depicted Cupid, hence one of the fountain's nicknames, \\"Cupid's Fountain\\". According to Portland Parks & Recreation, the figure was last recorded in 1912 in a photograph of Willis McElroy's band in the nearby bandstand. However, in the 1920s, freezing weather expanded water in the fountain, damaging the figure. The boy statuette was removed from the fountain and discarded by the 1940s, and it was not replaced. The fountain topped by a statuette of a boy, in a 1901 photograph The city planned to remove the fountain in 1960 due to disrepair. However, Mayor Terry Schrunk instructed the parks bureau to begin a restoration after Francis J. Murnane, a local longshoreman and advocate for historic preservation, appealed its removal. Much of its original decoration was absent, so replicas of existing pieces were constructed at a cost of $450. The restoration cost around $1,775, including assembly and installation. Despite its restoration, the fountain was no longer functional. Its condition was deemed \\"treatment urgent\\" by the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\\" program in February 1994. Since then, the fountain's plumbing has been restored. According to Smithsonian, the fountain is administered by the City of Portland's Metropolitan Arts Commission. Reception The fountain has been included in published biking and walking tours of the city, including one which described it as \\"elegant\\". It was also mentioned as a highlight of Washington Park in the 2010 guidebook Best Places: Portland and by Delta Sky Magazine. Similarly, Chiming Fountain has been included in descriptions of the park in guides recommending child-friendly activities and sites in the city.

It had its world premiere at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 23, 2011, where it won two Golden Gate Awards for Best Documentary Feature and Bay Area Documentary Feature. The documentary follows activists Bradley Crowder and David McKay as they plan to protest the 2008 Republican Convention. The film recounts their journey from boyhood friends growing up together in Midland, Texas, to the convention in St. Paul, Minnesota, and ends soon after their trials. Synopsis Told mostly from the young men's point of view, the film highlights on their political past growing up in a conservative town while they held more liberal, anti-war beliefs. These beliefs led them down a path towards a well-known activist, Brandon Darby, who made a name for himself for his work with hurricane Katrina victims. Known as an aggressive and no-nonsense activist, Darby had credibility from his affiliation with the Common Ground Collective or Common Ground Relief which worked to secure aid for hurricane victims. Darby, McKay, and Crowder, along with a few others, planned and executed a plan to protest the convention. Together they made shields to protect themselves from the police departments use of rubber bullets against protesters and headed off to the convention. Interviews with the FBI suggested that they were aware of these activities all along. They were intimately tracking these (and many other) protesters, and when the group reached St. Paul, they found it to be more like a police state than a city. As the story plays out, we learn exactly how the FBI became so knowledgeable: informants. And in this case, their informant was Brandon Darby. After their homemade shields were stolen at the convention, the men, along with Darby, became increasingly paranoid and terrified. Crowder and McKay decided to make molotov cocktails to be used in property destruction. They changed their minds, but didn't dispose of the devices. Soon after, the men were arrested under terrorism charges and their faces were plastered all over the news media. But the question of exactly who is to blame is at the center of the film. The men trusted and emulated Darby, and according to them, Darby influenced every decision that was made. So the viewer has to ask if they were entrapped. And if they were indeed entrapped, does that mean the government who is trusted to seek out terrorists to ensure freedom is implicit in terrorist activities?

His name was synonymous with the field of botany in the United States for more than 30 years. Although educated and well-versed across the spectrum of botany, Fink focused his passion on lichenology, publishing more than 100 research papers, reviews, notes and monographs. With a specialty in taxonomy, Fink‚Äôs contributions to the field of lichenology was in the realm of identifying the relationship, classification and distribution of lichens. He had a broad interest in fungi, particularly Ascomycetes. Several lichens have been named in his honor, including the species Calosphaeria finkii, Dermatina finkii, Patellaria finkii, and the genus Finkia. Early life and education Fink was born in Blackberry, Illinois on December 22, 1861 to Reuben and Mary Elizabeth Fink. He received his primary and secondary education in Blackberry. Fink earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1887 and a Master of Science degree in 1894 from the University of Illinois. It was during his time at the University of Illinois that Fink made the acquaintance of two professors who inspired him to pursue natural history. Fink went on to do his graduate work at Harvard University, where he received a Master of Arts degree in 1896. While at Harvard, Fink was the Townsend Scholar. Harvard brought him into contact with another great influencer, an expert and leading authority at the time in the field of lichens. This and other contacts not only propelled Fink to ultimately deliver his own contributions to the field of botany, but also opened the door for him to obtain his first two teaching jobs. Career Fink began his teaching profession at Upper Iowa University in 1892 as Professor of Botany. In 1903 he was recruited to become Professor of Botany at Grinnell College where he remained for three years. In 1906, Fink accepted the call from Miami University to head up the Department of Botany. He remained at the University until his death in 1927. Bruce Fink's earliest research paper was published in 1896. The topic was \\"Pollination and Reproduction of Lycopersicum esculentum.\\" At this time, his interest in lichens began to take hold, leading him to author numerous research papers on the subject. Fink was a member of numerous scientific societies, including Iowa Academy of Science (president), American Association for the Advancement of Science, Sigma Xi, and Botanical Society of America, among others, oftentimes assuming leadership positions. Bruce Fink was never one to shy away from controversy. He was an early champion of Schwendener‚Äôs proposal that lichens were actually dual organisms, consisting of both algae and fungi. It was a very unpopular thesis in America at that time. He went on to develop and advocate a classification scheme that positioned lichens amidst the fungi that he believed were parasitic on their algal component. He was an opponent of tobacco and published several papers on the subject of tobacco addiction. Fink was not content to merely study lichen systematics and floristics, he was also absorbed with their ecology and physiology. His floristic studies are the ones for which the world now remembers him, especially his studies of Minnesota lichens and his \\"Lichen Flora of the United States\\" which was completed by his student Joyce Hedrick after his death. \\"Lichen Flora...\\", although difficult to exploit, is the only study for the United States that considers all lichen groups (1,578 species, varieties, and forms, belonging to 178 genera and 46 families). Personal life Bruce Fink was married to Ida May Hammond and they had three children.

The film stars George Sanders, Richard Johnson, Faten Hamama, John Meillon, Ahmed Mazhar, Eric Pohlmann and the director's father Walter Rilla. The film was released on August 21, 1963, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.CAIRO Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 30, Iss. 348, (Jan 1, 1963): 36. The film is a nearly scene-by-scene remake of John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle. Plot Mastermind Brit criminal Major Pickering arrives in Cairo by air from a Greek prison, on a phony passport. The Major has a foolproof scheme to rob King Tut's jewels, which are displayed in the secure Cairo Museum and worth a quarter of a million dollars. Through his contact man Nicodemos, the shady casino operator brother of the Major's con artist passport illustrator Greek cellmate, he rounds up a disparate gang to execute the daring heist. The only gang member known to the Major is the reliable countryman and fellow soldier, an explosive expert safe-cracker, Willy (John Meillon), now a family man, marrying native and reluctant to go on the caper until persuaded by a fast $25,000 cut. Nicodemos gets untrustworthy import-export businessman Kuchuk to finance the caper, while the Major hires lazy coffee shop owner Kerim as driver and his hashish smoking hot-headed gun-wielding small-time stick-up man Ali as his enforcer. Ali looks upon it as his last chance to buy a sugar cane farm in his country birthplace, and pretends to be indifferent to the unconditional love shown to him by the penniless hard-luck nice girl belly dancer Amina. The boys go through the sewer as planned, but inside the museum an alarm is accidentally triggered and brings the police before they can make a clean escape. It results in Willy being fatally shot and dropped off at home. When the robbers that evening go to exchange the jewels for the money, Kuchuk and his gun wielding accomplice Ghattas pull a double-cross, and in an ensuing shoot-out Ghattas is dead and Ali seriously wounded, with Kuchuk now forced by the Major to make a deal with the police for $200,000 or they will melt down the invaluable jewels. When the frightened Nicodemos is intimidated by the persistent police commandant and Kuchuk commits suicide, the rest of the gang is rounded up before they can escape from Cairo‚Äîwith Ali dying in Amina's arms just as they reach by car his father's farm and the Major captured alive when staying too long to admire a belly dancer as the police raid the area.

She is a Democrat representing the 44th Assembly District, which encompasses portions of Ventura County and the city of Westlake Village. Prior to being elected to the Assembly in 2014, Irwin worked as a systems engineer at Johns Hopkins University and Teledyne, then served as a two-term Mayor and three-term City Councilmember in Thousand Oaks.  Early life and education  Irwin was born in the Tarzana neighborhood of Los Angeles to Dutch immigrants John and Barbara Van Egmond, and grew up in the Woodland Hills neighborhood. She graduated with a systems engineering degree from the University of California, San Diego, where she was an Academic All American swimmer.  Career  After graduating from UC San Diego, Irwin worked as an engineer for three years at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, then for five years at Teledyne. In 2003, Irwin was appointed to the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission, ran for City Council the following year, and became mayor of Thousand Oaks in 2008. In 2014, Irwin successfully ran as a Democrat in the race to represent California's 44th State Assembly district, defeating Republican opponent Rob McCoy. Irwin was reelected in 2016, defeating Republican opponent Kerry Nelson. She was reelected again in 2018, defeating Republican opponent Ronda Baldwin-Kennedy. = Legislative tenure = Irwin is the Chair of the Assembly Committee on Veterans Affairs, and the Assembly Select Committee on Cybersecurity. She also serves on the Committees on Agriculture, Business & Professions, Higher Education, and Privacy and Consumer Protection. Irwin has also been appointed to other significant roles including the Governor‚Äôs Military Council, and as Co-Chair of the National Conference of State Legislature‚Äôs Task Force on Cybersecurity.  2015-2016 session  During her first term in office, Irwin passed significant legislation. Irwin improved the cybersecurity of the state by mandating state agencies undergo independent security assessments, she banned powdered alcohol, expanded the ability of University of California research to be turned into real-world applications, and worked with Attorney General Kamala Harris to create the OpenJustice Web portal to provide better access to criminal justice data.  2017-2018 session  During her second term in office, Irwin helped secure critical funding for infrastructure projects in Ventura County, including $68.6 million for a grade separation project at Rice Avenue in Oxnard,CA, and $9.5 million for emergency wastewater treatment facility repairs in Oxnard, CA. She continued her work passing significant cybersecurity legislation, enacting into law the first ever security requirement for Internet of Things devices. Irwin also significantly changed how California Community Colleges approached remedial education in an effort to get students into transfer level courses.  2019-2020 session  In 2019 Irwin focused heavily on gun violence prevention legislation in response to the Borderline Shooting in Thousand Oaks, CA. Her legislation strengthened Gun Violence Restraining Orders, in part by allowing them to extend up to five years. She also required law enforcement agencies to have policies about using Gun Violence Restraining Orders. Irwin also secured $3 million to support local law enforcement efforts to recover firearms from individuals listed in the Armed and Prohibited Possessors System. Irwin also authored ACR-17 which renamed a portion of U.S. Route 101 in Thousand Oaks after Sgt. Ron Helus, from the Ventura County Sheriff‚Äôs Office who died in the line of duty during the Borderline Shooting. In 2020, Irwin shifted the majority of her efforts towards assisting her district‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Irwin spearheaded efforts to collect personal protective equipment (PPE) for front line health care workers and organized blood drives during a local shortage. Irwin also brought together local governments, academics, private businesses, and non-profits to conduct a COVID-19 antibody testing study in Ventura County. Irwin worked with the group to acquire reliable and available serology tests to be used for the study. She also helped identify and secure locations that would be utilized as testing sites for the countywide study which offered free COVID-19 antibody testing to residents. The antibody testing study was developed to not only understand the prevalence of COVID-19 in Ventura County, but was also modeled to understand the prevalence in targeted groups including first responders, low-income households, and those experiencing homelessness. Thousand Oaks Memorial controversy In October 2019, Irwin pulled out of attending a fundraising event for the family of an officer killed in the Borderline shooting. An organizer of the event claimed that Irwin's withdrawal was due to the planned attendance of Ronda Kennedy, a Republican who lost to Irwin in the 2018 election. After the Ventura County Sheriff's Office also withdrew from the fundraiser, citing a policy of non-participation in political events, the event was postponed indefinitely. Personal life Irwin married Jon Irwin, a corporate executive, in 1986, and has three children.

North Carolina, 574 U.S. 54 (2014), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court, ruling that a police officer's reasonable mistake of law can provide the individualized suspicion required by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution to justify a traffic stop. The Court delivered its ruling on December 15, 2014.  Background  On April 29, 2010, Maynor Javier Vasquez and Nicholas Heien were traveling along Interstate 77 in North Carolina. Vasquez was driving Heien's car, and Heien was sleeping in the back seat. While watching for \\"criminal indicators of drivers [and] passengers\\", Sergeant Matt Darisse observed Vasquez drive by and thought he appeared \\"nervous\\". Sergeant Darisse then began following Vasquez. Vasquez eventually slowed his car when approaching a slower-moving vehicle, and Sergeant Darisse observed the car's right rear brake light hadn't turned on. Sergeant Darisse believed that it was a violation of North Carolina traffic law to drive a vehicle with a broken brake light, so he activated his blue lights and stopped Vasquez (observing that as he did so, the right brake light \\"flickered on\\"). Sergeant Darisse informed Vasquez and Heien that he had stopped them for a broken brake light. During the stop, Sergeant Darisse began to suspect the vehicle might contain contraband. His suspicion increased when Vasquez and Heien claimed, in separate questioning, that they were traveling to different ultimate destinations. Sergeant Darisse then asked Vasquez if he could search the vehicle. Vasquez said he should ask Heien, who said he \\"d[id]n't really care\\". The ensuing search found cocaine. = In lower courts = Vasquez pleaded guilty to attempted cocaine trafficking. Heien filed a motion to suppress the results of the search to prevent their use in court, which the trial court denied. Heien then pleaded guilty to two counts of trafficking, while reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. On appeal the North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed. After careful analysis of the North Carolina statute governing brake lights, the Court of Appeals concluded that it required only one working \\"stop lamp\\". Heien's left brake light was functional, so his right brake light's dysfunction did not constitute a violation. It also concluded that separate statutory language requiring all \\"originally equipped rear lamps [be] in good working order\\" didn't apply to stop lamps. The Court of Appeals then concluded that the stop violated the Fourth Amendment, explaining that \\"an officer's mistaken belief that a defendant has committed a traffic violation is not an objectively reasonable justification for a traffic stop\\". The Court of Appeals then held that evidence from the search had to be suppressed under the exclusionary rule. (While federal courts and some state courts recognized a good-faith exception to the rule for officers acting in good faith, the North Carolina Supreme Court had previously explicitly declined to recognize it.) North Carolina appealed the decision to the North Carolina Supreme Court, challenging only the conclusion that a mistaken belief that a traffic violation had occurred provided no \\"objectively reasonable justification\\" for a traffic stop. (North Carolina did not challenge the Court of Appeals's interpretation of the traffic statutes.) After surveying the answers to this question provided by other circuit and state courts, the North Carolina Supreme Court concluded that the Eighth Circuit's answer ‚Äî that an officer may make a mistake of law and yet still act reasonably in making a stop based solely upon that mistake ‚Äî was correct, declining to adopt eight other federal circuit courts' answer. It then concluded that Sergeant Darisse's mistake of law was objectively reasonable and that he had reasonable suspicion to stop Heien's vehicle. Heien petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. On April 21, 2014, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.  Supreme Court  The Court published its opinion on December 15, 2014, affirming the lower court by an 8-1 vote.. Chief Justice Roberts authored the majority opinion, with Justice Kagan filing a concurring opinion in which Justice Ginsburg joined, and Justice Sotomayor filing a dissenting opinion. The majority held that a police officer's reasonable mistake of law can indeed provide the individualized suspicion required by the Fourth Amendment to justify a traffic stop based upon that understanding. In her concurring opinion, Kagan wrote that the full text of North Carolina's law \\"poses a quite difficult question of interpretation, and Sergeant Darisse‚Äôs judgment, although overturned, had much to recommend it\\". In her dissent, Sotomayor argued that the reasonableness of a search or seizure should instead be determined by evaluating \\"an officer's understanding of the facts against the actual state of the law.\\"  See also  * List of United States Supreme Court cases *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 574  References  External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:United States Fourth Amendment case law Category:2014 in United States case law ","title":"Heien v.

This framework came into force on 1 December 2014.  Vision The stated vision for industrialization is: \\"Research to Innovation, Innovation to Industry and Industry to prosperity.\\" The policy encompasses fourteen thrust areas with a plan to develop six industrial corridors and common infrastructure. The cornerstone to the policy is zero graft and zero corruption - in pursuit of a secure and progressive business environment. While large companies such as ITC, Tata Motors and Mahindra are planning to expand their business in the newly developed state(s), this policy has also gained significance in the investment community. History On 5 May 2011 the Andhra Pradesh administration introduced guidelines to drive industrial promotion in the state. This policy was successful in attracting corporations such as PEPSI and the Siri City project. This also boosted the growth of the service sector in Hyderabad, transforming it into anIT logistics hub. After bifurcation, both states sought investments that could increase employment and standard living. Telangana's policy framework was introduced on 27 November 2014 and came into effect on 1 December 2014. Telangana govt sets a record with new industrial policy and clears 17 projects worth Rs 1500 crore within 15 days of the launch. Core values * Facilitate industrial growth * Increase employment rates. * Inclusively facilitate social equality * Marginally effect the socially disadvantaged sections = Minimum inspection and maximum facilitation = Each industrial unit is to be inspected once every nine months; as established in advance. Occasional random inspections may occur with written permission of the department manager. Maximum facilitation encompasses an effective system beyond a single window anchor. Self-certification and automatic renewal will be encouraged along with an online E-Help line system. = Single window mechanism = Main article: TS-iPASS The industrial clearance system shall be beyond a single window system, and shall be called Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-Certification System (TS-iPASS). This operates at three levels: very large projects, large industries and SMEs. Thrust areas Core Sectors Include: * Life Sciences * IT hardware including bio-medical devices, electronics, and cellular communication * Precision engineering including aviation and aerospace * Food processing * Automobiles, tractors and farm equipment * Textiles and apparels * Plastics and polymers * Fast-moving consumer goods and domestic appliances * Engineering and capital goods * Gems and jewelry * Waste management and green technologies * Renewable energy and solar parks * Mine-based and wood-based industries * Transportation, logistic hub, and inland ports = Special support = A very low proportion of the population is owned by Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and women entrepreneurs.

He was actively involved in the legal profession and was one of the founders of Stewart McKelvey, the largest regional law firm in Atlantic Canada. McKelvey served as president of the Canadian Bar AssociationCanadian Bar Association: Past CBA Presidents and then was the first Canadian to be president of the International Bar Association.\\"Neil McKelvey headed the International Bar Association,\\" Globe and Mail, October 4, 2011.Past Presidents, and Divisions' Chairs of the International Bar Association In 1986, McKelvey was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada for his community service and contributions to the legal profession.Order of Canada Citation: Neil McKelvey Early life and family McKelvey was born in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1925, the son of Fenwick and Margaret McKelvey. In 1948, McKelvey married his wife, Joan. The couple were married for 63 years at the time of his death. They had two sons, Peter and Roger.Brenan's Funeral Home & Crematorium - E. Neil McKelvey Obituary Military career McKelvey was a veteran of World War II. He joined the Royal Canadian Artillery in 1944, and shipped overseas a few months later with the 4th Field Regiment of the RCR. In 1945, he was in the Netherlands when the war ended. McKelvey later transferred to the Canadian occupation force in Germany, not returning home until 1946. He remained active with the military for the rest of his life, serving as the Honorary Lieutenant Colonel of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, from 1992 to 2009. Legal career =Legal education and law firms= After he returned to Canada, McKelvey attended Dalhousie Law School in Halifax, graduating with a degree of Bachelor of Laws in 1949. He was called to the Bar of New Brunswick in the same year, and began practising with the firm of Porter, Ritchie & Riley.\\"Stewart McKelvey Mourns the Passing of Neil McKelvey,\\" September 13, 2011. In 1955, McKelvey founded the firm of McKelvey Macaulay Machum. That firm later merged with several other firms in the Atlantic provinces in 1990 to become Stewart McKelvey Stirling Scales, now known simply as Stewart McKelvey, the largest regional firm in Atlantic Canada. McKelvey continued on in the new firm as senior partner and counsel. McKelvey eventually served as a director on several corporate boards, including NB Power and Bell Canada/BCE Inc.\\"E. Neil McKelvey, O.C., Q.C., C.D., has been posthumously inducted into the New Brunswick Business Hall of Fame,\\" March 22, 2012. =Litigation practice= McKelvey was recognised as a top litigator in New Brunswick, throwing himself into his court cases. He appeared more than twenty times in the Supreme Court of Canada. His last Supreme Court case, in 1990, was taken on a pro bono basis on behalf of a woman who lost the sight in one eye following a cataract surgery. McKelvey successfully argued that the evidence led at trial was sufficient to prove a legal claim of negligence. The decision remains a leading case on the burden of proof of causation in malpractice cases.Snell v. Farrell, [1990 2 SCR 311.] As a lawyer in the Maritimes, McKelvey appeared several times in cases involving shipping issues, such as an inquiry under the Canadian Shipping Act into the 1957 collision between the Saint John harbour boat and the freighter Fort Avalon. He also represented the Canadian Coast Guard before a Royal Commission inquiring into the grounding of an oil tanker, Arrow, in Chedabucto Bay, Nova Scotia, in 1970. The grounding resulted in the spill of 108,000 barrels of oil, leading to questions about the way the Coast Guard had responded to the environmental hazard. For many years, he was also counsel for the owners of the Irving Whale, an oil carrying barge that sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1970 and posed a potential environmental hazard. In the early 1960s, McKelvey faced a decision about his career path, when his name was mentioned for a possible appointment to the New Brunswick Court of Queen's Bench. McKelvey turned down the appointment, preferring to remain a litigator. Years later, he explained his decision: ‚ÄúI had to choose whether I wanted to be a judge or to remain a lawyer; I concluded that the secluded life of the bench, listening to lawyers argue cases and then having to prepare a decision, was not for me.‚ÄùMcKelvey, E. Neil, I Chose Law: Memoirs of E. Neil McKelvey, OC, QC. Leader in bar associations =Saint John Law Society= In 1969, McKelvey served as President of the Saint John Law Society, the local organization for lawyers in Saint John. =Canadian Bar Association= McKelvey was involved in the Canadian Bar Association both provincially and nationally. In 1962, he was the president of the New Brunswick Branch of the CBA. A decade later, he serve as the national President of the Canadian Bar Association in 1973-1974. During his time in office, the CBA produced a model code of professional conduct. McKelvey was a strong believer in the value of solid ethics for lawyers, and toured the country to promote the new code. He was a strong advocate for the role of lawyers in society: ‚ÄúLawyers are the lubricants of society. Just as lubricants keep a machine functioning, lawyers minimize the frictions in society to keep it functioning.‚Äù =International Bar Association= McKelvey served as President of the International Bar Association in 1979-1980, the first Canadian to hold that post. The IBA is one of the leading international associations of lawyers and law societies. When he took the position, the IBA's finances were in a poor shape, but by the time he left, it was on a sound financial footing. One of his major concerns while with the IBA was defending the independence of the legal profession. He stated that lawyers must have the ‚Äú‚Ä¶ courage to disregard influences of third parties whose interests may differ from the client, even though those third parties may be in a position to bring strong pressure to bear, financial or otherwise, on the lawyer.‚Äù =Membership in bar associations= McKelvey was a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, the American Bar Association, the ADR Atlantic Institute, the American Arbitration Association and ADR Chambers Canada. Community service McKelvey was very active in his community, serving on numerous community groups. At various times, he was Chairman of the Saint John Port Development Commission, Chairman of the Saint John Regional Hospital Foundation, Director of the Saint John Seafarers‚Äô Mission, President of the Saint Patrick's Society of Saint John, Commodore of the Royal Kennebeccasis Yacht Club, a board member of the Imperial Theatre, and a member of the Board of Governors of Dalhousie University.

He was a leader of the Russian antifascist movement, and a member of the Coordinating Council of the anti-Putin opposition. He became famous as a prominent critic of the government's destruction of woodland. In 2010, Gaskarov was a spokesman for a large environmental protest in the Moscow suburb of Khimki. He was put on trial and found not guilty. In May 2012, he was beaten during the Bolotnaya Square protests in Moscow, and was later arrested, tried, and convicted. On August 18, 2014, he was sentenced to three and a half years in a penal colony. Early life and education He was born on June 18, 1985, in the Moscow suburb of Zhukovsky. He began to be politically active while in school. He began his political activism by participating in and organizing grass-roots efforts to protect the Khimki and Tsagovsky forests from destruction. Gaskarov was known as the ‚Äúunofficial mayor‚Äù of Zhukovsky, where he sought to encourage fellow citizens to organize and demand their rights. In Zhukovsky, Gaskarov ‚Äúorganized a homeowners association, a soccer club, participated in creating a coffee shop, opened a movie theater, organized screenings and concerts,‚Äù and engaged in other civic activities. ‚ÄúGaskarov has invested a great deal of time and energy in seeing that his hometown of Zhukovsky... develops in a way that is responsive to the needs of ordinary citizens,‚Äù stated one source. ‚ÄúAs a community organizer and activist in his hometown... he was an emerging talent in leftist opposition circles,‚Äù according to one source. He has ‚Äúadvocated for free and fair elections. Amid a rise in nationalist and neo-Nazi activity in Russia, he was a leader in the anti-fascist movement.‚Äù Feodor Karpov, the father of Gaskarov's fianc√©e, stated ‚ÄúHe was for justice but was always trying to find a constructive solution.‚Äù In 2007 he graduated from the State Government Academy of Finances. After graduating in 2007, he began work as a consultant. Activism =Khimki protests and trial= He became famous in Russia and elsewhere when he was arrested on August 30, 2010, a day after a grassroots protest in the Moscow suburb of Khimki in which he was as a spokesman. The protest was against the government's plan to destroy the Khimki forest in order to construct a new Moscow-St. Petersburg highway. Gaskarov was known as one of the ‚ÄúKhimki hostages.‚Äù On October 22, 2010, Gaskarov was released from police custody by Khimki Judge Svetlana Galanova in defiance of an appeal by the prosecution to leave him in police custody. Gaskarov expressed surprise at the judge's action, saying that he had little faith in the Russian judicial system. The prosecution presented no new evidence against Gaskarov, aside from a FSB report stating that Gaskarov was a longtime activist of the antifascist movement (apparently in an informal youth association), was an organizer and participant of unauthorized actions (and so detained on March 20th, 2010 for it), had foreign contacts, and had taken part in unsanctioned protests. The prosecution accused him of Gaskarov testified ‚Äúthat anti-fascism is not a crime, that his antifascist views cannot be cause to place him under arrest, and that his trips abroad are his own personal affair.‚Äù Gaskarov said that on March 20th he participated in the march as a correspondent for the NGO Institute \\"Collective action\\" and, after his arrest, was acquitted by the magistrate's court. On July 28th, Gaskarov also arrived in Khimki as a correspondent for Institute \\"Collective action\\", which is confirmed by a letter from the leaders of the NGO itself. Gaskarov was released and in the summer of 2011 he was cleared of all charges. After Gaskarov was acquitted from the Khimki case, the police ‚Äúsubjected him to constant pressure, including several attempted provocations,‚Äù according to one source. =December 2011 elections= Gaskarov was an observer at the December 4, 2011, Russian elections, and said ‚Äúwhat we saw was quite clear-cut. Indeed, it is a weird situation when you are trying and cannot even find a single person in your circle who would say ‚ÄòI voted for United Russia, and that‚Äôs why this party is doing so well.‚Äô Actually there were no such people, there was no mass support for those in power.‚Äù Gaskarov went on to become an active participant in the mass demonstrations against what the protesters saw as the falsification of the December 2011 Russian elections. He spoke at the largest demonstration, on December 24, at which he also organized security, which involved forestalling neo-Nazi provocations. His public activities in December 2011 marked the beginning of his career as a high-profile media presence and commentator. =Bolotnaya Square protest= During the Bolotnaya Square protests, which took place in Moscow on May 6, 2012, the day before Vladimir Putin's inauguration as president of Russia, Gaskarov was beaten by riot police using batons and boots. The protests were the first occasion in which Russian police under Putin crushed opposition protests. One report stated that both Gaskarov and his fianc√©e, Anna Karpova, ‚Äúfound themselves caught up in the melee‚Äù between police and protesters. ‚ÄúThe police charged and people were falling and being detained,‚Äù Karpova later said. ‚ÄúIt was chaos. I was walking behind Alexei when I heard him yell ‚Äòstop‚Äô and lunge forward.‚Äù According to one source, Gaskarov was beaten after shouting at a unit of soldiers for dragging another protester across the concrete. ‚ÄúThe soldiers beat Gaskarov with their batons and kicked him in his face so he suffered several bloody wounds. His injuries were documented in the hospital where he was treated.‚Äù An amateur video showed Gaskarov ‚Äúpulling a security trooper off a fallen protester and then releasing him.‚Äù Another video showed ‚Äúan officer kicking him in the head as he lay on the ground.‚Äù That night, Gaskarov was given several stitches. On May 28, 2012, Gaskarov attempted to open a case against the officers who had mistreated him, but no action was taken in the matter. In October 2012, he was elected to the Coordinating Council of the Russian opposition. As a member of the Coordinating Council, ‚Äúhe has consistently pursued a grassroots social movement agenda.‚Äù In March 2013, Gaskarov won election to the alternative People's Council of Zhukovsky. =Arrest and trial= Almost a year after the Bolotnaya Square protests, on April 28, 2013, as he was looking to head the anti-fascists in Russia, he was taken into custody in Moscow, becoming the last person to be arrested in the Bolotnaya Square case. He was taken into custody when he left his apartment to buy groceries. His arrest came ‚Äújust a few days before the anniversary of the May 6 demonstration,‚Äù when ‚ÄúGaskarov was preparing to lead a left-wing and anti- fascist column at May Day demonstrations.‚Äù He was charged with involvement in the organization of mass riots and in violent activity against the authorities. He was placed in jail, and was given a court date of April 29, 2013. On May 11, 2013, police detained nine people at a bicycle rally held in Moscow to show solidarity with Gaskarov. Less than two months after Gaskarov's arrest, his lawyers asked the Moscow City Court to release him from detention pending trial. Russian Duma deputy Dmitriy Gudkov, human-rights advocate Lev Ponomarev, and Novaya Gazeta editor-in-chief Dmitriy Muratov vouched for Gaskarov, assuring the court that he would not flee the country. This request was rejected on the supposed grounds that Gaskarov ‚Äúdid not reside at the address where he was registered, used secrecy to conceal his criminal activity, and possesses the financial capability to leave the Russian Federation.‚Äù In late March 2014, Gaskarov's case, along with those against his fellow activists Ilya Guschin, Elena Kokhtareva, and Alexander Margolin, was sent to the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court in Moscow. During the lead-up to the trial, Anna Karpova, Gaskarov's fianc√©e, told the Institute of Modern Russia that ‚ÄúAlexey is very seriously preparing for the trial. He wants to utilize his legal base to its full extent and is going to participate in the process to the fullest extent. Even despite the circumstances, when one might think it impossible to influence the process, he is very active in terms of defending and asserting his position.‚Äù His pretrial hearing began on April 14. One commentator described the trial as ‚Äúa farce which demonstrates that the facts are completely irrelevant for the outcome.‚Äù At the trial, the persons presented as witnesses were not identified by their real names but by pseudonyms. These witnesses purportedly testified that Gaskarov ‚Äúhad given orders to a group of people who actively participated in the ‚Äòmass riots.'‚Äù The prosecutor also claimed that Gaskarov had pulled an ‚Äúinternal forces soldier‚Äù by his hand and pulled a member of the OMON riot police away from another activist whom he was placing under detention. Neither officer was harmed. Gaskarov acknowledged that he had sought to protect a fellow activist from an officer, explaining that ‚Äúpeople who did not demonstrate any aggressive behavior were being beaten and detained.‚Äù One report stated that the charges against Gaskarov were ‚Äúbased on the statements of two 'secret witnesses.' Another individual said during the trial that a state government agency, the Anti-Extremist Center, had pressured him ‚Äúto make a false statement against Gaskarov.‚Äù In secret testimony, police officers said ‚Äúthey had video evidence that Gaskarov had led attacks on police, though the footage was never shown.‚Äù As the trial proceeded, on source stated ‚ÄúGaskarov was repeatedly denied bail, and evidence that might have helped clear him was rejected or ignored.‚Äù Another report stated that Gaskarov and his lawyers were ‚Äúconvinced‚Äù that authorities wanted to imprison him ‚Äúby any means‚Äù because of his political activity. Critics said the trial was ‚Äúpart of a Kremlin campaign to stifle dissent while all eyes are on the Ukraine crisis.‚Äù Acting on the assumption that he would be found guilty, Gaskarov and Karpova were married at his Moscow prison in early August. On August 14, 2014, Gaskarov gave his closing statement at the trial. He said that the case had ‚Äúbecome emblematic‚Äù because it showed ‚Äúhow power deals with opposition ‚Äì with those whose view is different from the general line.‚Äù He stated that the movement against the Putin regime had drawn more and more members because of Putin's declaration ‚Äúthat the idea of interchangeability of power wasn‚Äôt best for Russia.‚Äù He added that ‚Äúwe should be happy that the events on the Bolotnaya Square happened exactly this way because in all developed democratic countries protests...shape political competition, which allows a country to find an optimal way of development.‚Äù He also asked: ‚Äúis there a right to protest in Russia, which all developed countries have? At present, as we can see, Russia is deprived of this right.‚Äù He further pointed out that none of the police that had abused him and other protesters had been brought up on criminal charges; on the contrary, he said, ‚Äúour case has been an attempt to make the police into some untouchable caste.‚Äù In conclusion, Gaskarov asked that the judge make a decision based not on politics but on ‚Äúwhat we have really done.‚Äù Still, he said, ‚Äúin this country, if the path to freedom lies through prison, then we are ready to take it.‚Äù On August 18, Judge Natalia Susina sentenced Gaskarov to three and a half years in a penal colony for ‚Äúinciting mass riots.‚Äù His co-defendant Ilya Goushchin was sentenced to two and a half years and Alexander Margolin to three and a half years. Karpov said in August 2014 that electoral and judicial corruption had destabilized Russia's political system to the extent that the only solutions were now extreme ones, and as a result Russians may eventually ‚Äúfind that figures like Alexei Gaskarov,‚Äù a reformer and not a revolutionary, ‚Äúwould be sorely missed.‚Äù References  External links  *Free Alexey Gaskarov Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:People from Zhukovsky, Moscow Oblast Category:Russian activists Category:Russian anti-fascists Category:Russian dissidents Category:Russian prisoners and detainees Category:Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation alumni ","title":"Alexey Gaskarov"},{"id":"44560202","text":"Tabernaemontana ciliata is a species of plant in the family Apocynaceae.Tabernaemontana ciliata at www.theplantlist.org.

There is a small inlier of the Lynton Slates at the foot of the Quantock scarp at Triscombe. The formation is composed of slates and siltstones together with some sandstone. Though its base is not seen, it is believed to be between 3‚Äì400 m thick. There are fossils of brachiopods, bivalves and bryozoans present, consistent with a shallow marine depositional environment.British Geological Survey 1984 Taunton England and Wales sheet 295 Solid & Drift Geology. 1:50,000 scale geological map (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) One of Devon and Exmoor's better known natural tourist attractions is Valley of the Rocks, a dry valley developed in this formation just to the west of Lynton.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/Lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=LNSL (BGS on-line lexicon of rock units) Hangman Sandstone Formation The Hangman Sandstone forms the coastal outcrop east from Hangman Point as far as Heddon's Mouth and indeed the larger part of the cliffs eastwards again to Woody Bay. It again forms the coastal cliffs from Lynmouth Bay east to Porlock Weir, including Foreland Point and Culbone Hill and also from Hurlstone Point to Minehead. The Porlock Ridge and Saltmarsh Site of Special Scientific Interest has a shingle ridge deposited during the Holocene epoch.

These rocks extend from Morte Point, where they form the coast between Woolacombe and Flat Point, south-southeastwards through West Down and Arlington then east to Withypool. Further east the outcrop broadens to form the Brendon Hills and the rolling country around Clatworthy Reservoir. The eastern extent of the main outcrop reaches the villages of Stogumber and Tolland. An outlier forms the southeastern part of the Quantock Hills between Goathurst and West Monkton. Over the centuries the Brendon Hills have been mined for minerals, notably ironstone from which iron is extracted for making steel. During the 19th century this activity reached a peak with the West Somerset Mineral Railway, including an incline, being built to take the ore to Watchet from where it was sent to Ebbw Vale for smelting. The main mining operations ended when the mines were worked out towards the end of the 19th century. Pickwell Down Sandstones Formation Brayford Quarry The Pickwell Down Sandstones are red and brown sandstones with shales which extend from the hills of Pickwell Down and Woolacombe Down overlooking Morte Bay east- southeastwards to Muddiford and Bratton Fleming. The outcrop pattern is shaped by a major east-west aligned syncline/anticline pair between Brayford, where there is a stone quarry, and Dulverton. East of Dulverton the formation forms the prominent Haddon Hill and extends via Heydon Hill as far east as the village of Wiveliscombe. There are a number of former workings for iron, copper and manganese across the western part of its outcrop.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/Lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=PDS (BGS on-line lexicon of rock units) A geomorphological survey at Anstey's Coombe showed that mining had taken place at the site during both the Romano-British period and the 16th to 17th century. Upcott Slates Formation The Upcott Slates provide the coastal cliffs on the south side of Morte Bay and their narrow faulted outcrop continues east-southeastwards beneath Georgeham and to Winsham and Marwood. The outcrop continues east via Shirwell to Little Bray, north of Brayford. Slightly offset by faulting to the south, it continues east to North Radworthy. A major east-west syncline in this area gives rise to an outcrop stretching southwest to East Buckland and then by virtue of a parallel anticline, stretching southeast then east to North Molton. Subject to numerous northwest-southeast aligned faults, the outcrop can be followed via Molland to east of Dulverton. The formation consists of slates varying in colour from buff through grey and green to purple. These rocks originated as muds laid down in swamps and freshwater lakes.British Geological Survey 1982 Barnstaple England and Wales sheet 293 Solid & Drift Geology. 1:50,000 scale geological map (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey)http://www.bgs.ac.uk/Lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=USL (BGS on-line lexicon of rock units) Baggy Sandstones Formation Climbers on the Baggy Sandstone at Baggy Point The Baggy Sandstones form the headland of Baggy Point and the faulted outcrop stretches away to the east north of Croyde, through Knowle to Stoke Rivers and Brayford. Its outcrop wraps around a syncline/anticline fold pair in a reverse-S shape via East Buckland and parallels the outcrop of the Upcott Slates east to Dulverton. It is mapped as a distinguishable unit of the Exmoor Group as far as the Batherm valley, east of Skilgate. The formation consists of sandstones, siltstones and shales including some feldspar and mica rich units, variously of marine through brackish to freshwater origin. The outcrop forms a small yet prominent ridge along its outcrop.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/Lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=BYS (BGS on-line lexicon of rock units) Pilton Mudstone Formation The Pilton Mudstones form the coast at Croyde Bay and form the headland at Saunton Down. The formation extends eastwards through Barnstaple to the Buckland area where due to a syncline/anticline pair, the surface outcrop divides. A thinner band of these strata continues east coincident with the valley of the River Yeo and the former railway to Brushford. The outcrop broadens once again forming the country around Clayhanger and Waterrow before reaching its furthest east at Kittisford and at Nunnington Park, south of Wiveliscombe. The formation consists of shales and siltstones along with bands of calcareous sandstone. Fossils include brachiopods and bivalves in the lower part of the formation, suggestive of a shallow marine depositional environment and, in its upper part, trilobites and goniatites indicating deeper water conditions. The sandstones thicken to the east and have been worked in quarries between Charles and Brayford. Limestones occurring towards the top of the formation have also been worked in places. Whilst most of it is Devonian, the uppermost part of the formation is Carboniferous in age though the precise location of the boundary is difficult to determine.British Geological Survey 1982 Barnstaple England and Wales sheet 293 Solid & Drift Geology. 1:50,000 scale geological map (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) References Category:Carboniferous System of Europe Category:Devonian System of Europe Category:Geological groups of the United Kingdom Category:Geology of Somerset Category:Geology of Devon ","title":"Exmoor Group"},{"id":"44560238","text":"Tabernaemontana coriacea is a species of plant in the family Apocynaceae.Tabernaemontana coriacea at www.theplantlist.org.

It was discovered on 2 November 1991, by American astronomer Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory in California, and later named after Japanese astronomer Saeko Hayashi.  Orbit and classification  Saekohayashi is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8‚Äì2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (981 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 20¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. In November 1983, it was first identified as at the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory, extending the body's observation arc by 8 years prior to its official discovery observation at Palomar.  Physical characteristics  = Slow rotation and shape = In 2009, a rotational lightcurve of Saekohayashi was obtained by American astronomer Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory, Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of hours with a high brightness variation of 0.78 magnitude (). A high brightness amplitude typically indicates that the body has a non-spheroidal shape. While not being a slow rotator, it has a notably longer than average period. = Diameter and albedo = The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a high albedo of 0.30, typical for E-type asteroids, and calculates a diameter of 3.7 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 14.1.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Japanese astronomer Saeko S. Hayashi (born 1958), associate professor at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, who works with the Subaru Telescope. Her research includes the formation processes of planetary systems. Saeko is also dedicated to the popularization of astronomy in Hawaii and Japan and is an active member of the International Astronomical Union.

He played in the Football League for Charlton Athletic and Southampton. Playing career Purves was born in High Spen, County Durham and as a child was a keen supporter of his local club, Newcastle United. Although he was taken on by them as a trainee, he failed to make the grade but played youth football for various clubs in the north-east. In October 1946, he moved to London to join First Division club Charlton Athletic. In his first season at The Valley, Charlton won the FA Cup, defeating Burnley 4‚Äì0 in the Final. Purves was not in the team for the semi-final match against his boyhood heroes, Newcastle United, and turned up to watch the match at Elland Road, Leeds wearing a Newcastle United rosette, much to the displeasure of Charlton's manager, Jimmy Seed. After five years at Charlton Athletic for whom he made 46 Football League appearances, scoring four goals, he was signed for Southampton in June 1951. He made his Southampton debut on 15 September 1951, when he took the place of Ted Bates at inside-right for a 2‚Äì0 victory over Doncaster Rovers. Although he played for five of the next six matches, he then lost his place to Jimmy McGowan. Described as a \\"constructive inside-right\\", his personal best season for the \\"Saints\\" came in 1952‚Äì53, when he made 21 appearances, although Southampton ended second from bottom and were relegated to the Third Division. Although Purves played in the opening two matches of the 1953‚Äì54 season, he was then dropped in favour of Roy Williams; his final Southampton appearance came on 6 March 1954. At the end of the season he was released, having made a total of 36 appearances with four goals for Southampton. Later career After retiring from full-time football, Purves remained in the Southampton area, working at Vosper Thornycroft and continuing to play non-league football until his mid-40s, including a period as player-manager of Basingstoke Town. Purves was married to Ivy Grace and had daughters Christine, Angela and sons Alan and David. He died on 20 June 2013.

Life =Early years= Scheibe was born in a sleepy market town in Saxony-Anhalt, some 45 km (28 miles) south-west of Leipzig. His father was a labourer and his mother was a cook. Scheibe was bought up by his grandparents, both of whom were early members of the German Communist Party (KPD).Armeerundschau Nr.10-1983 He received a basic education at the small local school and then undertook an apprenticeship as a typesetter in Gohlis (Leipzig). =Political activism and detention during the Nazi years= Between 1930 and 1933 Scheibe was a member of the Young Communists (KJVD / Kommunistischer Jugendverband Deutschlands). In January 1933 the National Socialists seized power and membership of political parties (other than of the Nazi Party) almost immediately became illegal. During the ensuing twelve years most of Scheibe's life was spent in prisons and concentration camps. He was arrested in August 1933, charged with preparing to commit high treason (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\") and sentenced to eight months of detention, which he spent at the Bautzen Correction Centre. He was released in June 1934 but appears to have continued to undertake illegal political activities and was arrested again in June 1935, faced the same charge as a before, and was sentenced to a further two years. He was initially taken back to Bauzen before being transferred, in 1937, to Buchenwald where at one stage he was put in charge of the camp post office. He also spent a large amount of time during the Nazi period in a Correction Centre in Zwickau. =The Soviet occupation zone / The German Democratic Republic= The war ended in May 1945 and with it the Nazi regime. Scheibe at once joined the Communist Party (KPD), which the next year, following a forced merger of political parties, would leave him as a member of the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED/ Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). Military career On 1 June 1945 he joined the People's Police (VP / Volkspolizei) in the Soviet occupation zone (SBZ / Sowjetische Besatzungszone), in the central part of what had till recently been Germany. This was the part of the country in which he had grown up, and it was the part that during the next few years would evolve into the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). From 1945 till 1948 Scheibe was deputy head of the Criminal Police in Leipzig, then serving from 1948 till 1949 as the Head of the Criminal Police in G√∂rlitz. The following year he was selected and sent for special training in the Soviet Union. After returning to East Germany he joined the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft (literally \\"Standby Police\\") in Prenzlau. Immediately following the Second World War there had been agreement among the occupying powers that there was no place for an army in Germany, but in East Germany the Volkspolizei (people's police) nevertheless retained some of the quasi-military characteristics associated with the police services under the Hitler regime: by 1950 the \\"Standby Police\\" were coming to be seen as a military force by another name. Between 1951 and 1956 Scheibe served in various leadership capacities with the Kasernierte Volkspolizei (literally \\" People's Police in barracks\\"), a different (and in the end larger) quasi-military police service which would in retrospect become recognised as the precursor of the East German National People's Army.

Scheibe returned from Moscow in 1959 and became Deputy Chief of the General Staff and Chief of Operations in the newly established army. Between 1960 and 1967 he served as Chief and Chief of Staff in the Air-force. In 1967 he was appointed Chief of the Air-force, a high-profile position which he held till 1972.

The firm announced that it has left the binary options business and is exploring other possibilities. It had previously announced a downsizing of its operations in Israel and moving many functions to other locations. The firm claimed to have 70 percent share in the market for binary options platforms, and charged binary options firms up to 12.5% of their revenues. The firm's office in Ramat Gan was raided by the FBI, accompanied by Israeli police, in January 2018. The FBI was searching for evidence in the case of Lee Elbaz. Elbaz, CEO of Yukom, a binary options broker, was accused of fraud. She was convicted of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in August 2019, and in December 2019 sentenced to 22 years in federal prison. As of March 2020 restitution to victims was still being decided but a figure of $28 million was being considered. Pini Peter, owner of SpotOption said his company has left the binary options business and \\"I‚Äôm considering closing the company down altogether.\\" On 30 January 2018 Facebook banned advertisements for binary options trading as well as well as for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offering (ICOs). Founding Sources disagree on the founding of the company. Bloomberg reports \\"Spot Option\\" at 7 Jabotinsky, Ramat Gan, Israel, was founded in 2011; a location consistent with information from Companies House in the UK which list a founding date of 2016. The nonprofit public interest news organization Bureau of Investigative Journalism reports a unit in Israel appearing in 2010. They also report that the founder and primary shareholder is Pinchas Peterktzishvilly, also known as Pini Peter, who was convicted on money laundering charges in 2005. According to an advertisement for Banc De Binary, its CEO Oren Shabat Laurent was a founder of SpotOption. Oren himself was embroiled in significant controversy surrounding hiring experts to obfuscate the truth about Banc de Binary and SpotOption's affiliate funnel online; which effectively sees the latter create a range of affiliate funnel online products such as auto-traders, which in turn lure new depositors into placing funds at Spot Option's tied agents and brands. Market positioning and controversy The firm claims that two thirds of the binary option dealers around the world use SpotOption, and that the firm has $5 billion annual trading volume. In 2015, the company's former CEO, Ran Amiran, said \\"SpotOption is the industry\\". SpotOption and TechFinancials together supply trading technology to brokers with claimed $8 billion annual turnover. SpotOption supplied brokerages including the now defunct Banc De Binary, formerly SpotOption's biggest client, and smaller brokerages including itrader, BDSwiss, OptionRally, Webitrader, and FXDD. In 2016, SpotOption claimed 300 brands or affiliates. among them are: * Banc de Binary, once SpotOption's largest client, shut down in January 2017 after being fined or prohibited from operating in multiple countries on three continents. * BD Swiss, also known as Banc de Swiss, a licensed brand of Keplero Holdings Ltd, fined ‚Ç¨150,000 in December 2016 by CySEC, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission. BD Swiss has addresses in Cyprus and Germany, but not Switzerland. * The demise via self-inflicted gunshot wound of Canadian entrepreneur, Fred Turbide, was attributed to Spot Option powered 23Traders.com brand. According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, \\"PowerPoint presentations posted online by Hong Kong-based SpotOption sales manager Thomas Chang in 2016 and former Middle East sales manager Fakhri Husseini in 2013 told potential brokers that only 20% of people who invest in binary options ever get any money back after signing up.\\" SpotOption exhibited at the IFX Expo International held in Cyprus in May 2016. Their director of marketing, Tammy Levy, when asked about crackdowns by law enforcement, was quoted as saying \\"SpotOption is a technology company, okay? Everyone is responsible for checking regulation in the jurisdiction where they want to work. I am here to tell you what options you have technologically.\\" Gambling using binary options At the 2011 iGaming Super Show, the company showed its platform to traditional gaming vendors, claiming it was compatible with industry regulations and profitable for operators. Peterktzishvilly (Pini Peter) said they intended \\"to bridge the forex and gaming industries\\". The company appeared at numerous gambling industry trade shows including ICE Totally Gaming in London in 2014 and the American Gaming Association's Global Gaming Expo Asia 2015 in Macao, calling itself creator of \\"the perfect financial game\\". In May 2015, SpotOption launched its new Spot5 platform that would include new instruments called \\"digital contracts\\". These were developed in order to meet new regulatory requirements. On 23 August 2017, the company announced their intention to launch a blockchain based trading platform for binary options called SpotChain, a new product which will raise money from the crowds to fund their operations.

While scriptures related to Khandoba do not mention Banai, she is a central subject of folk songs. Banai is considered as a Dhangar, a sheep herding caste, and is sometimes regarded to be of celestial origin. Oral traditions chiefly discuss the tale of her marriage to Khandoba and her conflicts with his first wife Mhalsa. Banai is an antithesis of Mhalsa; together they complete the god. Banai is generally depicted with Khandoba and often is also accompanied by Mhalsa. Banai does not enjoy independent worship, but is worshipped as Khandoba's consort in most of his temples. She is the patron goddess of the Dhangar community and is worshipped as a protector of their herds. Development and symbolism Khandoba with Mhalsa and Banai, at Mailar Mallanna Temple, Khanapur near Bidar, Karnataka Though Khandoba is a god with five wives, his first two consorts Mhalsa and Banai are the most important. The tale of the King or god with two wives is retold with some variation across India: Murugan and his wives Devasena and Valli; Venkateswara, Lakshmi and Padmavati being some examples. The motif of Shiva and his wives Parvati and Ganga is told in the Puranas. The theme of the god marrying a tribal girl like Banai recurs across the Deccan region; another example being Valli's marriage to Murugan.Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel pp. 323-4 Deities across the Deccan (even extending to Kerala and Tamil Nadu) often have two wives; one wife from a high caste and another from the lower social strata: a lower caste or a tribal.Sontheimer in Channa pp. 32-33 Khandoba's wives who come from various communities establish cultural linkages of the god to these communities, who worship them as their patron god. While Banai is considered as a legal wife of Khandoba in Maharashtra (especially with the Dhangars), the Kurubas of Karnataka regard her as a concubine.Sontheimer in Channa p. 35 While Mhalsa is from the high-caste Lingayat merchant (Vani) community, Banai is described as a Dhangar (shepherd caste), representing the \\"outside\\" and associates Khandoba with non-elite herding castes like Dhangars, Gavli and Kuruba (Gowda) who live in the forest. Some traditions consider Banai as a Gavli (cowherd caste) or Koli (fisherman caste). In Karnataka, she is called Kurbattyavva and is a Kuruba. Banai is an antithesis Mhalsa. Mhalsa has a regular ritualistic marriage with Khandoba. Banai, on the other hand, has a love marriage after being captured by the god. Mhalsa is described as pure, ugly, jealous and a good cook; Banai is impure, erotic, resolute, but does not even know to cook. Mhalsa represents \\"culture\\" while Banai \\"nature\\"; together they aid the god-king Khandoba.Sontheimer in Feldhaus, pp. 116-8 The oral legends and texts initiate a process of Sanskritization of the folk deity Khandoba by elevating him to the classical Hindu god Shiva; his two principal wives Mhalsa and Banai are equated to Parvati and Ganga.Stanley in Hiltebeitel p. 278 Banai does not appear in the Sanskrit Malhari Mahatmya, the main scripture related to Khandoba, however it mentions Ganga arriving from heaven. Banai (Ganga) has a quarrel with Mhalsa (Parvati), ultimately ending with the message that both are the same. Some Dhangars consider Banai also to be a form of Parvati.Sontheimer in Feldhaus, p. 127 The chief source of legends related to Banai are ovi (pada) or folk songs sung by Vaghyas and Muralis, the male and female bards of Khandoba. They sing at jagrans (a vigil) where the bards sing in praise of Khandoba through the night. The songs talk about the relationship of Khandoba to his consorts and the mutual relationships of the wives. They are centred on Mhalsa and Banai and often narrate about their quarrels.Sontheimer in Feldhaus, p. 115 The tale of the marriage of Khandoba and Banai is a central theme in many Dhangar folk songs. The Varkari saint Sheikh Muhammad (1560-1650) disparages Khandoba in his Yoga-samgrama and calls him the \\"mad\\" god that searches for Banai due to \\"sexual passion\\", an allusion to the tale of Banai's marriage, indicating that the tale was well-established by this era.Sontheimer in Barz & Horstmann, p. 39 According to scholar G√ºnther-Dietz Sontheimer, the legend of Banai has close parallels with the story of King Dushyanta and Shakuntala from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The tale of another folk god Mhaskoba (Bhairava) to gain his wife Balurani or Balai despite obstacles is also similar to Khandoba's endeavour to win over Banai. Legends Banai does not appear in the Malhari Mahatmya originating from the Brahmin (high-priest caste) tradition, which glorifies Khandoba as Shiva and de-emphasizes his earthly connections. In contrast, Banai occupies the central position in the Dhangar folk narrative and Mhalsa's marriage to Khandoba is reduced to a passing mention; Marathas and other settled castes give more importance to Mhalsa.Sontheimer in Barz & Horstmann, pp. 38, 40 = Early life = Generally, Banai's birth is not discussed in the folk songs. Few regard her as an avatar of the apsara (celestial nymph) Rambha, while others consider her as one of the seven daughters of Indra, the king of the gods. She is found by a Dhangar in a golden box in the forest, hidden in a termite mound or a pit. Her Dhangar father (sometimes named Yamu) is the chief of shepherds, who owns nine lakh sheep and goats, nine lakh lambs and numerous barren ones. Yamu is said to have prayed for a child and finds Banai in a box. A virgin ewe is said to have fed Banai her milk, as Yamu does not have a wife and does not know how to feed the infant. In another miracle, a three-storeyed house appears at the place of Yamu's tent for the young Banai to reside, while the rest of the Dhangars live in tents.Sontheimer in Barz & Horstmann, pp. 13-14 She grows up as a rich shepherdess and becomes the overseer of twelve Dhangar vadas (pastoral settlements or camps, inhabited by different Dhangar clans). She cares for her sheep, grazes them and learns how to breed them. = Marriage = Once, Khandoba and Mhalsa play a game of saripat (translated as game of dice or chess). Khandoba loses everything to Mhalsa in the wager, except his dhoti, his flag, his staff (wand) and his bhandari, the bag of magical bhandara (turmeric powder). In a dream, he sees Banai and falls in love with her. He goes on a hunt in the forest, gets away from the army and stays with Banai for twelve years. He marries her in non-ritualistic marriage and brings her back to Jejuri. A variant describes how Khandoba arrives in Chandanpur on a hunting expedition and becomes thirsty. A Dhangar directs him to Banai's vada. Banai offers him water or sends a pot of water, in which Khandoba reads Banai's name. In another version, the pot with nine jewels is a sign for Khandoba to recognise Banai, the girl he saw in his dream. He falls for her and loses purposefully in saripat with Mhalsa and accepts a twelve- year exile. In this period, he disguises himself as an impoverished, old leper and becomes a man-servant of Banai's father. Some folk songs have erotic overtones, for example, some songs give erotic descriptions of Banai's beauty which maddens Khandoba. Khandoba is described as doing odd jobs under Banai's orders. Banai first assigns him the task of sweeping the entire vada. He is responsible for cleaning the sheep pens and taking the sheep and lambs for grazing. He completes all tasks by spreading his magical bhandara. The shepherds are astonished how a single old man can handle all the animals. Their vanity is crushed. Banai assigns him the additional responsibility of taking care of five hundred children. She commands if any sheep or lamb is lost or a child cries, she will not give him his food. But Khandoba fulfils the tasks again by spraying his bhandara. She assigns him the job of washing the sheep and lambs. Instead, Khandoba kills all her sheep and lambs to humble the shepherds and Banai. He skins the sheep and separates the meat. A repentant Banai begs his forgiveness; he agrees to revive her flock on the condition that Banai marries him. Khandoba revives the sheep by spreading his bhandara and reveals his true form.Sontheimer in Feldhaus, pp. 116-32Sontheimer in Channa pp. 35-44Sontheimer in Barz & Horstmann, pp. 15-21 The wedding is deemed not in accordance to Hindu rituals. Banai and Khandoba marry in a simple, un-Brahmanical ceremony, where sheep droppings are showered on the couple, instead of rice as in the ritualistic weddings of classical (Brahmanical) Hinduism. The wedding is conducted without a Brahmin officiating priest. Shepherds read the mantras (the responsibility of the Brahmin in a normal wedding) and the bleating of sheep replaces the traditional wedding band. The wedding is sometimes described as a gandharva marriage. Due to the unceremonious nature of the wedding, she is sometimes considered as a rakh (concubine) of Khandoba.Sontheimer in Channa pp. 35, 44 = After marriage = Painting on the outer wall of Banai's temple, Jejuri. Khandoba and Mhalsa are depicted killing the demons. Rarely, Banai replaces Mhalsa in the description of the incident. In all versions, Khandoba returns to Jejuri with his new wife and faces the wrath of Mhalsa. Many songs tell about the confrontations of Mhalsa and Banai. In some songs, Mhalsa complains about Khandoba's infatuation with the impure Banai. The cantankerous Mhalsa grumbles how Banai has polluted the house by her uncouth ways and suggests that Banai should be returned to the wilderness again. The songs sing how the vegetarian, high-caste Mhalsa is forced to catch fish and eat in the same plate as the non-vegetarian low-caste Banai. Mhalsa is portrayed blaming Banai for the problems in the palace and talking about her superiority to Banai. Banai retorts by saying that Khandoba came to her, mesmerized by her beauty and became her servant. A frustrated Khandoba leaves the palace on a hunting trip after Mhalsa and Banai quarrel about who will embroider a shawl for him and marries Rambhai. The songs also narrate how ultimately the wives have to remain in harmony and aid each other. For example, a song sings how Mhalsa and Banai come together and celebrate the festival of Diwali with Khandoba at Jejuri. Rarely, Banai also appears in Khandoba's chief legend where he slays the demons Mani and Malla. Mhalsa and Banai (or Ganga) futilely help Khandoba in the battle to collect the blood of Mani, every drop of which was creating a new demon. Finally, the dog of Khandoba swallows all the blood. Rarely, Banai is described as seated behind Khandoba on the horse and fighting with a sword or spear, a role generally assigned to Mhalsa.Stanley in Hiltebeitel pp. 280-4 Worship and iconography While traces of Banai/Balai's association with the folk god Biroba as a \\"mother\\" remain, Banai rarely enjoys independent worship in modern times. She is generally worshipped as Khandoba's consort.Sontheimer in Channa, p. 45 While in Karnataka, her temple is outside the village and Mailara (as Khandoba is known in Karnataka) journeys every year to visit it for ten nights from his temple in the village. In Maharashtra, Banai's temple is inside the village, but outside the chief temple, as in Khandoba's chief temple at Jejuri. Mhalsa - who is installed in the main temple - is said to resist the arrival of Khandoba's new wife Banai and thus, Banai does not reside in the chief temple. Frustrated by the constant quarrels between the two wives, Khandoba is said to have divided the hill of Jejuri into two halves: the lower half belongs to Banai, where she has a separate shrine while Mhalsa rules the upper half where she stays with Khandoba in the main temple.It is customary to pay respects to Banai on the way up to the main shrine, before worshipping Khandoba and Mhalsa there. It is said that Khandoba bestowed the honour of first worship on Banai, while sending her off to a separate residence. Banai is the patron goddess of the Dhangars and the protector goddess of flock and herds. She takes care of the well-being of the community and is worshipped for increasing the herd. Stone votive images of sheep and other cattle are offered to her for plentiful animals. No animal sacrifice or non-vegetarian offerings are presented to Khandoba directly, instead non-vegetarian offerings intended for Khandoba are offered to Banai. Dhangars sacrifice rams in her honour and offer her a naivedya (food offering) of liver, meat and rice, especially on the holy days: Vijayadashami (when warriors traditionally set off on war or on a journey) and the full moon days in the Hindu months of Magha and Chaitra. Khandoba is often depicted with two identical goddesses accompanying him, representing Mhalsa and Banai. In brass images, Banai is depicted holding a lamb and offering water to Khandoba, while Mhalsa rides with Khandoba on his horse. In metal plaques worshipped by the Dhangars, Banai accompanies Khandoba on his horse and is depicted with sheep.Sontheimer in Barz & Horstmann, p. 41 Notes References  * * Category:Hindu goddesses Category:Hindu folk deities Category:Animal goddesses ","title":"Banai (goddess)"},{"id":"44560390","text":"This incomplete list covers the ever-expanding field of video production, and the companies which produce video products, whether for private or commercial purposes.

An artillery expert, he gained fame during the Turkish Wars of the late 18th century.  Biography  Born Johann M√∂ller to a family of Lutheran German burghers, he entered the Russian artillery in 1739 as a rank private, and by 1752 had been commissioned as an officer. By 1759 he was a lieutenant-colonel, and saw action in the Seven Years' War. At the Siege of Kolberg in 1761 he gained distinction as commander of the artillery under Rumyantsev, and was later entrusted with organizing and commanding one of the army's first light infantry units.Duffy, Christopher. Russia‚Äôs Military Way to the West: Origins and Nature of Russian Military Power, 1700-1800. London, 1981. pg. 120-121 In the following years M√∂ller would continue to be promoted, reaching the rank of lieutenant-general in April 1773. As a senior officer of Russia's artillery branch, M√∂ller was made a member of the Main Chancellery for Artillery and Fortifications in 1772 and soon became its preeminent member. After the death of Prince Grigory Orlov in 1783 M√∂ller succeeded him as General Feldzeugmeister, the titular head of the Imperial Army's artillery corps (he had been de facto head for several years before that), and was promoted to the rank of general-in-chief. With the outbreak of war with the Ottoman Empire in 1787, Prince Grigory Potemkin asked M√∂ller to join his field army based out of Ekaterinoslav, and assist in the planning of besieging Ochakov. After the strategic fortress was taken, M√∂ller was awarded with both the Orders of St. Andrew and St. George in the 2nd class alongside the title of baron. During the campaign of 1790, he was given command of his own field corps assigned to seize the fortress of Kiliya. During an attempted storming of the city, M√∂ller was mortally wounded and died on October 10. General Ivan Gudovich took over command and captured the city a few days later. M√∂ller- Sakomelsky was considered a critical reformer of Russia's artillery forces in the 1770s and 80's. He oversaw the recasting of guns so that they were significantly lighter and more easily moved in battle, but not any less powerful. He removed weapon types like the Secret howitzer from service to simplify logistics and training. In June 1788 he composed a Supplement for gunners explaining how to best use their weapons against Turkish forces, updating tactics that had not been revised in three decades.Duffy, Christopher. Russia‚Äôs Military Way to the West: Origins and Nature of Russian Military Power, 1700-1800. London, 1981. pg. 183 The name M√∂ller-Sakomelsky came from the general's elevation to the rank of baron in 1789, Sakomelsky being derived from his granted estate in the volost of Zakomelsky located near Usvyaty. He had numerous offspring, two of whom became prominent generals in Russian Army. Yegor (1767-1830) was a cavalry commander during the Napoleonic Wars, participating in many critical battles of the invasion in 1812. His elder brother Pyotr (1755-1823) was Minister of War from 1819 to 1823. The family continued to provide officers to the military service up until the Russian Revolution.

It took place during the privatization process of T√ºrk Ticaret Bankasƒ± (TTB), aka T√ºrkbank. Background Established as a regional bank by private investors under the name Adapazarƒ± ƒ∞slam Ticaret Bankasƒ± in 1913, T√ºrkbank became the first private bank of Turkey. Following the Turkish financial crisis, which blew up in January 1994, and the devaluation of the Turkish currency at hundred percent, the bank weakened, which operated 274 branches and employed 4,532 staff nationwide at that time. The bank was taken under control by the Treasury in May of the same year. The bank's 84.52% stake was taken over by the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund of Turkey (, TMSF) for sale in a public tender. The TMSF requested for tender on May 4, 1998. On May 18, Police of Istanbul applied to the State Security Court () to obtain a permission to eavesdrop businessman Korkmaz Yiƒüit's mobile phone for the length of one month due to reasonable grounds on his existing ties with and money transfer to organized crime. On August 4, Yiƒüit's construction company with his Bank Ekspres placed the highest bid of US$600 million for the majority stake, followed by US$595 million of Zorlu Holding controlling Denizbank. Right after the accomplishment of the tender process, the police notified the TMSF in writing about the relationship between Yiƒüit and the mob boss Alaattin √áakƒ±cƒ±, and √áakƒ±cƒ±'s thraetening other bidders of the tender. Korkmaz Yiƒüit (born 1943) was a self-made businessman, who owned two banks, two newspapers and three television channels at that time, all acquired not a long time ago. Alaattin √áakƒ±cƒ± (born 1953), a former member of the ultra- nationalist organization Grey Wolves and one of the leading mobs of the Turkish underworld, was a fugitive since 1992, sought for several crimes. √áakƒ±cƒ± had connection with businessman Erol Evcil, who had tried to purchase T√ºrkbank in 1995. On August 17, 1998, √áakƒ±cƒ± was apprehended in France upon request by the Turkish Police, and extradited to Turkey. Fikri Saƒülar, a deputy of the Republican People's Party (CHP) in the opposition and a former Minister of Culture, received a recording tape by mail on August 29, which contained a conversation between Yiƒüit and √áakƒ±cƒ± about the T√ºrkbank tender. On October 8, Saƒülar submitted the recording tape to his friend Tuncay √ñzkan, the news director of Kanal D, for broadcasting on the TV. As Kanal D did nothing in the meantime, Saƒülar disclosed the private conversation at a press conference on October 13. Thereupon, the TMSF annulled the tender for T√ºrkbank sale on October 15, 1998. Downfall of Yƒ±lmaz cabinet and trial Yiƒüit was taken to the Organized Crime Department of Istanbul Police, where he presented a testimony of five pages on November 12, in which he confessed all his connections and unlawful doings related to the tender process. The scandal spread over to the politics when some information from Yiƒüit's testimony leaked to the public. It became apparent that Prime minister Mesut Yƒ±lmaz and Minister of State responsible for Economy G√ºne≈ü Taner were involved in the scandal. Yiƒüit claimed that \\"Yƒ±lmaz and Taner encouraged him to buy T√ºrkbank, and offered him loans from other state banks to ensure that his bid was the highest\\". He was arrested, tried and imprisoned, losing all his assets during this time. Right after the political scandal emerged, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey formed a parliamentary investigation committee. Yƒ±lmaz was invited to testify before the committee. The coalition cabinet led by Yƒ±lmaz was brought to fall by motion of no confidence on January 11, 1999. After hearing several politicians and journalists, the parliamentary committee prepared an investigative report, which blamed Yƒ±lmaz for conspiring to rig bids on tender. However, the report became obsolate due to the upcoming 1999 general election to be held on April 18. After the 2002 general election on November 3, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and CHP both pushed the suspended corruption cases, including the T√ºrkbank scandal. On December 9, 2002, a parliamentary committee was formed, which heard further witnesses involved in the tender process, and investigated the allegations against Yƒ±lmaz and Taner once again. Accomplished on June 25, 2004, the thousands-page report concluded Yƒ±lmaz and Taner of bid rigging, and proposed their trial at the Constitutional Court of Turkey (), which is the supreme court for trials of high-ranking politicians in Turkey. The parliament assembly accepted the report by 429 votes in favour of the total 447 present in the 550-seat parliament (276 votes would have been sufficient) on July 13, 2004. Yƒ±lmaz asked for his trial before the independent Constitutional Court. On July 23, the Constitutional Court rejected the submission on the grounds that the case has to be separated for both defendants. The parliament decided on October 27 to send the two politicians separately to the Constitutional Court. Mesut Yƒ±lmaz became so the first prime minister ever to stand trial in the Constitutional Court of Turkey. The highest court ruled on June 23, 2006 that on some of the allegations relating to their term of office and responsibilities, Mesut Yƒ±lmaz (June 30, 1997 ‚Äì January 11, 1999) and G√ºne≈ü Taner (June 30, 1997 ‚Äì November 25, 1998) are guilty of bid rigging as per Turkish Penal Code's Article 765 Section 205. However, the sentences were reprieved in accordance with applicable laws.

Their value, for their patrons, was their military capabilities, their loyalty and discipline. Their ability to capitalize on opportunity for social mobility, while maintaining their own unique cultural identity created an interesting tension in their social narrative. Their slave origins created a discrepancy in their nobility. This discrepancy was often eluded in commentary by the Persian Chroniclers of the time. Origins The need to secure the Sultanate regime from Mongol marauders led to the delineation of a frontier that needed to be defended.Sunil Kumar, \\"The Ignored Elites: Turks, Mongols and a Persian Secretarial Class in the Early Delhi Sultanate,\\" Modern Asian Studies 43, no. 1 (2009): 45‚Äì77. To guard the Punjab marches, there was increasingly more and more slaves that were being bought. Their allegiance was not along ethnic lines, and their dedicated patronage allowed them to incorporate themselves into the military hierarchy as trusted officers and commanders. The Sultanate bought Turks in order to develop a strong cavalry arm and in particular to amass a corps of mounted archers.Peter.

Jackson, \\"Turkish Slaves on Islam‚Äôs Indian Frontier,\\" in Slavery & South Asian History, ed. Indrani Chatterjee and Richard M. Eaton (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2006)65 Turks, being brought into a foreign land, having no particular ethnic allegiance still maintained a cultural identity. In addition to holding high rank in the military, certain Turks, that were particularly dedicated to their patron also enjoyed holding ceremonial positions in court.Turkish Slaves 64 The sultans even honored non- Turks with Turkish titles.Sunil Kumar, \\"Service, Status, and Military Slavery in the Delhi Sultanate: Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries.\\" in Slavery & South Asian History, ed. Indrani Chatterjee and Richard M. Eaton (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2006), 83‚Äì114. Social status As one Sufi saint noted \\"they were slaves, not learned in the secretarial or Islamic sciences, they were rude, bellicose and vain and their military calling undoubtedly led to unjust killing of innocent people\\".Sunil Kumar, \\"Service, Status, and Military Slavery in the Delhi Sultanate: Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries.\\" in Slavery & South Asian History, ed. Indrani Chatterjee and Richard M. Eaton (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2006), 89 One can see when viewing how the institution of Turkish Slaves in the Delhi sultanate created a problem. Their excellence was preceded by slave origins. These origins were often not spoken of, where possible, in order to create a more refined image. The quality of being a Turk per se, was not a problem it was their slave origin that created a challenge.Sunil Kumar, \\"The Ignored Elites: Turks, Mongols and a Persian Secretarial Class in the Early Delhi Sultanate,\\" Modern Asian Studies 43, no. 1 (2009): 61 It was ironic that these marginalized groups happened to be the political elites and Sultans of Delhi in itself creates a telling commentary on the incomplete state of evidence and the dire need to rewrite the narrative of the sultanate.Sunil Kumar, \\"The Ignored Elites: Turks, Mongols and a Persian Secretarial Class in the Early Delhi Sultanate,\\" Modern Asian Studies 43, no. 1 (2009): 45‚Äì77. Life in the Sultanate There existed a racial divide among the Persians and the Arabs, this was displayed in social riots. The free counterparts to the slaves were distinct members of society, and were not able to predicate the term to which the Sultanate and the slaves would maintain its power. Authority was derived mostly from their patronage, and while they were deployed as military slaves it did not hinder their ability to seize political power. Their privileged job opportunities were not invulnerable to critique because of their slave origin. This shows that while status within the Sultanate can be seen through post - their origins were inescapable social paradigms. This is a subtle continuity of the hierarchical class structure based on birth from the Indian caste system. They were termed 'new Muslims' within the Sultanate. Reputation Turkish slavery was very distinct from the conventional idea of a slave-master relationship. While it was based on subservience, the high ranking positions and yielded power that resulted from their careers created an aura of power, rather than weakness and submission. Their reputation did not hinge on social status but on their relationship and their career. They had a mixed reputation for greed and turbulence as well as for martial accomplishments and perseverance in Islam.Sunil Kumar, \\"The Ignored Elites: Turks, Mongols and a Persian Secretarial Class in the Early Delhi Sultanate,\\" Modern Asian Studies 43, no. 1 (2009): 45‚Äì77. They had subordinates of their own, and they had a level of autonomy that created a dismay from onlookers who were aware of their Slavic origins. Within the Sultanate, which was composed of Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, Turks, Afghans and many other groups - the reputation of the Turks was of high stature - regarding them as elites in the community. Impact The infusion of immigrants from the Afghan Punjab frontier into the Delhi Sultanate helped shape its future. Social and cultural history of Muslim society, and the reproduction of authority within the Delhi Sultanate can be attributed to these slaves. Their ambition was often degraded by their social status, through the scope of the existing ideals of the Persian Chroniclers and the institutionalized caste system of the Hindus. The outsiders, the deployed slaves, and their purpose can be said to be more than just military assets. They created for themselves their own circles of elites. They did this while maintaining their identity. Their language spread throughout the sultanate. Their story, often eluded by the narratives of the time, is one of dedication and discipline. Skills and expertise in battle acted as a catalyst to gain favor, reverence, that lead to high ranking positions which placed them as an authority in a heterogeneous society. The deliberate tension within the Delhi Sultanate due to their Slavic origins, only further displays their importance in society. The role of the Sultans, as former Slaves, and their attempt to spread turkishness, by electing Turkish titles to non-Turks, and by incorporating the Turkish slave into high governing ranks in the court - shapes the landscape both socially and politically. These 'new Muslims' helped shape the identity of the Delhi Sultanate and help instil the Islamic Culture into this Indian Kingdom. Studies In the broader context of learning about South Asian history, one can find an inconclusive range of facts surrounding the portrayal of day-to-day life. Often, certain aspects of society or identity are left out because either they are thought to be insignificant or not part of the greater narrative. As one can see in the example of the Turkish Slaves, the court chroniclers chose to elude aspects of their history. So, as the authors that have been referenced in this article have done, one must piece together the puzzle. To do this, the authors thought outside the box and looked beyond court scribes, into memoirs, personal letters, and documents indirectly linked to the topic. Turkish slaves provide a narrative of capitalizing on opportunity, building authority, and creating a reputation so large that its true origins had to be hidden, for they may tarnish views on their accomplishments. It is also questioned if the deployment into the frontiers and employment into the Delhi Sultanate a way for the 'Turkish' culture to flourish or it was a way to ensure the authority of Islam could flourish, through the installation of military men into the capital.

On 28 June a People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) mortar attack on Cam L·ªô killed 2 Marines and wounded 5. On 14 July in preparation for Operation Hastings, General Lowell English established his command post at Cam L·ªô with security provided by 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines and artillery support from the 3rd Battalion, 12th Marines. Following the completion of Operation Hastings, the artillery and tanks from the 3rd Tank Battalion remained at Cam L·ªô with security provided by 2 Companies from 2/4 Marines. The artillery and tanks were used to support Marine patrols into the DMZ as part of Operation Prairie. On the early morning of 26 August the 812th Regiment of the PAVN 324B Division attacked Cam L·ªô resulting in 9 Marines killed and 20 wounded. From February‚ÄìMarch 1967 the Marines launched Operation Prairie II a series of sweeps from Cam L·ªô to Con Thien resulting in 93 Marines and 694 PAVN killed. In March 1967 Route 9 west of Cam L·ªô was reopened to Khe Sanh for the first time since 1964. The road would suffer numerous ambushes making it dangerous if not altogether unusable. Cam L·ªô was intended to form a supporting base for the McNamara Line and provided artillery support USMC forces engaged at Con Thien.

Generally speaking communication ethics deals with the moral good present in any form of human communication. This includes interpersonal communication, mass mediated communication, and digital communication. Ethical communication encompasses being honest in all communications, keeping confidential information confidential, and not discussing the personal or business situations of plagiarism is a crime others in public or in front of a third party. Overview Communication ethics concerns not only the individual, but is of great concern to businesses, corporations, and professional entities. A business with unethical communication practices is not as effective as one with ethical communication practices. For example, a business with unethical communication practices may withhold evidence that it is harming the environment or breaking a law through a lack of transparence; while a business with ethical communication practices will immediately press a release to the affected parties. In this example, transparency makes the business more effective because it notifies its clients, prospective or established, providers/suppliers, or other affiliates of the potential environmental hazard or law violation. In other words, in this example, transparency will encourage trust and good faith, that the effective business will not conceal what is in the interest of its audience. For the sake of counterexample, there may be a time when censorship is the more effective business practice: take the case of trade secrets, when a design method or management tactic is not openly revealed in the name of competitive advantage; or when terms of agreement/use that a business may have with a service provider forbids transparency. In the latter counterexample, a business may use social media to advertise, but the social media service provider may limit the conduct of its users. Here, if the business considers social media to be a valuable service to achieve its advertising, it may have to censor its product or service to preserve its agreement with the social media provider. Communication ethics is also a division of the NCA (National Communication Association) which was established by Western Michigan University in 1985, as well the NCA has adopted a Credo for Ethical Communication. The Communication Ethics Conference has been held every year for the last 13 years, and has various speakers from Communication Studies backgrounds.

Pyridines occur widely in natural and synthetic products, so there is wide interest in routes for their synthesis. The method is named after Dr. Fritz Kr√∂hnke. Reaction development =Discovery= In his work at the University of Giessen, Kr√∂hnke observed condensation of Œ±-pyridinium methyl ketone salts 1 with Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl compounds 2 via a Michael reaction when treated with ammonium acetate to give 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridines in high yields under mild reaction conditions.Zecher, W.; Kr√∂hnke, F. Ber. 1961, 94, 690-697. The proposed intermediates, 1, 5-dicarbonyl compound 3, have not been isolated.Kr√∂hnke, F.; Zecher, W. Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English 1962, Volume 1, pages 626‚Äì632. Since its discovery, the Kr√∂hnke synthesis has enjoyed broad applicability to the preparation of di-,tri- and tetrapyridine derivatives, demonstrating a number of advantages over related reactions such as the Hantzsch pyridine synthesis. center =Mechanism= The mechanism of the Kr√∂hnke pyridine synthesis begins with enolization of Œ±-pyridinium methyl ketone 4 followed by 1,4-addition to the Œ±, Œ≤-unsaturated ketone 5 to form the Michael adduct 6, which immediately tautomerizes to the 1,5-dicarbonyl 7. Addition of ammonia to 7 followed by dehydration via 8 generates the imine intermediate 9.,Potts, K. T.; Cipullo, M. J.; Ralli, P.; Theodoridis, G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981, 103, 3584-3586.Kelly, T. R.; Lee, Y. J.; Mears, R. J. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 2774-2781 The imine intermediate is then deprotonated to enamine 10 and cyclizes with the carbonyl to generate intermediate 11. The pyridinium cation is then eliminated to form hydroxy- dienamine 12. Aromatization of 12 via subsequent loss of water generates the desired pyridine heterocycle 13. center =Reagent synthesis and reaction conditions= The starting materials for the Kr√∂hnke synthesis are often trivial to prepare, lending to the convenience and broad scope of the method. Preparation of the Œ±-pyridinium methyl ketone salts can be easily achieved by treatment of the corresponding Œ±-bromo methyl ketone with pyridine. The Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones are often available commercially or can be prepared using a number of known methods. Additionally, Mannich bases can also be utilized as the Michael acceptor for the scheme, further diversifying the scope of starting materials that can be incorporated into the Kr√∂hnke scheme.Kr√∂hnke, F.; Zecher, W.; Angew. Chem. 1963, 75, 189 The reaction conditions for the Kr√∂hnke synthesis are generally facile and the reactions often proceed in high yields with reaction temperatures generally not exceeding 140 ¬∞C.Kr√∂hnke, F. Synthesis. 1976, 1, 1-24 The Kr√∂hnke synthesis is generally performed in either glacial acetic acid or methanol, but it can also be done under aqueous conditions, and more recently under solvent-free conditions. 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds have also been shown to be viable starting materials in place of the Œ±-pyridinium methyl ketone salts.Rehberg, R. W.; Kr√∂hnke, F. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem.1968, 91, 717 For example, treatment of 1,3-diketone 14 with base in ethanol followed by ammonium acetate, acetic acid, the corresponding enone and a Lewis acid yields 3-acyltriarylpyridines of the form 15. These acyl pyridine are attractive intermediates because they have an electrophilic handle that allows for additional functionality to be incorporated into the molecule. This allows for straightforward construction of complex polyaryl systems, an attractive method for library synthesis of drug targets containing functionalized pyridine moieties. center =Advantages over other methods= The Kr√∂hnke synthesis for making pyridines possesses a number of succinct advantages over other methods. Unlike the Hantzsch synthesis,Hantzsch, A. (1881). \\"Condensationprodukte aus Aldehydammoniak und Ketonartigen Verbindungen\\". Chemische Berichte 14 (2): 1637 the Kr√∂hnke method does not require oxidation to generate the desired product since the Œ±-pyridinium methyl ketone already possesses the correct oxidation state. Another advantage of the Kr√∂hnke synthesis is its high atom economy. For example, the Chichibabin synthesis requires 2 equivalents of unsaturated starting material.Chichibabin, A. E. J. prakt. Chem. 1924, 107, 122 Additionally, the byproducts of the Kr√∂hnke synthesis is water and pyridine, which allow for easy workup and purification protocols. Unlike comparable methods for pyridine synthesis, the Kr√∂hkne synthesis benefits from being a high-yielding one pot synthesis, which ultimately allows for abbreviation of synthetic pathways and further simplifies combinatorial library cataloging. Scope and limitations The broad scope of the Kr√∂hnke pyridine synthesis has made it particularly useful for the synthesis of poly aryl systems including pyridyl, thienyl, and furanyl moieties as well. The method tolerates a broad array of aryl substitiuents on both the Œ±-pyridinium methyl ketone fragment and the Œ±, Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and can thus be used to generate a wide catalog of poly-aryl systems. Additionally, electron-withdrawing groups and electron-donating groups on the incoming aryl substituents are both well tolerated. The Kr√∂hnke synthesis can also employ alkyl and vinyl substituents giving moderated to good yields as well.K√ºrti L√°szl√≥, Barbara Czak√≥. Strategic Applications of Named Reactions in Organic Synthesis. Elsevier Inc.: Burlington, Massachusetts. Due to its broad scope, the Kr√∂hnke method has seen wide applicability to for the synthesis of bipyridines (16), terpyridines (17), quaterpyridines (18) and even up to septipyridines (19) as shown below.Kr√∂hnke, F.; Kr√∂ck, F. W.; Chem Ber. 1971, 104, 1645 center Variations and combinatorial studies The Kr√∂hnke method is featured in a solvent-free synthesis of triarylpyridines that proceeds via a homo-coupling of two diaryl substituted Œ±, Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.Adib, M.; Tahermansouri, H.; Koloogani, S. A.; Mohammadi, B.; Bijanzadej, H. R. Tetrahedron Lett.2006, 47, 5957-5960 This strategy offers a facile means for preparation of pyridnyl aryl systems that are important fragments of many useful drug scaffolds. center In 1992, Robinson and co- workers developed a similar pyridine synthesis using enamino nitriles as one of the three-carbon fragments in place of an Œ±-pyridinium methyl ketone.Robinson et. al. J. Org. Chem. 1992, 57, 7352 This improvement increases the reactivity of the system and allows for formation of fully substituted pyridines whereas use of an Œ±-pyridinium methyl ketone requires that the 3- or 5- position on the resulting pyridine be unsubstituted. Kr√∂hnke condensation of enamino nitrile 20 with enone 21 yielded fused pyridine 22. center The mechanism of this Kr√∂hnke-type reaction likely proceeds via a vinylogous cyanamide 23 which undergoes elimination of hydrocyanic acid, deprotonation to form enamine 24 and cyclization to form intermediate 25, which is then dehydrated to form the desired pyridine product. center A clean one-pot Kr√∂hnke method in aqueous media generates 4‚Äô-aryl-2,2‚Äô:6‚Äô, 2‚Äô‚Äô-terpyridines.Tu, S.; Jia, R.; Jiang, B.; Zhang, J.; Zhang, Y.; Yao, C.; Ji, S. Tetrahedron, 2007, 63, 381-388 Reaction of aryl aldehyde 26 with two equivalents of 2-acetylpyridine (27) yielded terpyridines of the form 28. center In addition to variations on the original method, a number of combinatorial studies using the Kr√∂hnke synthesis and its variations have been employed to synthesize vast libraries of highly functionalized pyridines. Janda and co-workers utilized the general Kr√∂hnke reaction scheme to generate a 220 compound library.Janda, K. D.; Wirsching, P.; Fujimori, T. J. Comb. Chem.2003, 5, 625-631 Various methyl ketones 29 and aldehydes 30 were coupled via aldol condensation to give enones of the form 31. These compounds were then reacted with various Œ±-pyridinium methyl ketones 32 to give the desired tri-substituted pyridine 33. center In 2009, Tu and coworkers developed a 3 fragment, one-pot combinatorial strategy for developing 3-cyanoterpyridines 34and 1-amino-2-acylterpyridines 35.Tu, S.; Jiang, B.; Hao, W.; Wang, X.; Shi, F. J. Comb. Chem. 2009, 11, 846-850 These combinatorial variations of the Kr√∂hnke reaction provide an efficient synthetic strategy to poly arylpyridine scaffolds. This methodology would also be advantageous for biological assays and screening experiments. center Synthetic applications to ligands and biologically active molecules The Kr√∂hnke methodology has also been utilized to generate a number of interesting metal-binding ligands since polypyridyl complexes such as bipyridine (bipy) have been used extensively as ligands. The Kr√∂hnke synthesis was used to prepare a family of tetrahydroquinoline-based N, S-type ligands.Chelucci, G. et al. J. Mol. Catal.

The mid to low-altitude tropical rain forest covers hilly country, from 400 to 550 metres in altitude, on the eastern verges of the largest southern African forest of this type, altogether 820 km2 in extent. It can be reached using public transport from Sussundenga. Flora and fauna =Flora= Buchwa bamboo at Tava marsh in Moribane forest M√ºller et al. (2005) described two main vegetation types, namely a) moist, evergreen forest dominated by Forest newtonia (Newtonia buchananii), Chirinda stinkwood (Celtis mildbraedii), Forest ordeal tree (Erythrophleum suaveolens), and Panga-panga (Millettia stuhlmannii), and b) transitional forest on the northern verge of the forest, where the predominant species were Winged bersama (Bersama abyssinica), Panga- panga, Two-winged pteleopsis (Pteliopsis myrtifolia), Toad-tree (Tabernaemontana elegans), and Bushveld bitterwood (Xylopia longipetala). =Fauna= Native mammals include Bush elephant, Bushbuck, Red duiker, Samango monkey, Bushpig and several species of small carnivore. History Moribane forest was intensively exploited from the early 20th century onwards, initially for natural rubber derived from Rubber vine, and subsequently for its native timber species, namely Red mahogany, Iroko and Panga-panga. As the 21st century approached, it was damaged by wildfires and shifting agriculture. Despite past overexploitation, the widespread occurrence of saplings of Stem- fruit miraculous-berry, Forest newtonia, Iroko, Panga-panga and Forest ordeal tree, gives reason for hope that it will naturally regenerate. Renamo had a stronghold in the area during the Mozambican Civil War. By the end of the war in 1992 the forest was largely intact, but its Bush elephant population was reduced. While the local people had earlier observed taboos on hunting of elephant, they now had concerns about the recovering elephant population. Chief Mpunga argued that the relation between elephants and humans was spiritual, and people subsequently moved out of the area frequented by the elephants. Facilities Ndzou (i.e. Elephant) camp is a joint venture between Eco-Micaia and the local community, which offers guided walks, and a chance of tracking of the shy, forest-living Bush elephants with a local guide. A number of forest trails can be taken from Ndzou camp or Mpunga ranger camp, varying from 4 to 12 km in length. The Mpunga ranger camp, located 3 km to the south of Ndzou, caters only for visitors who bring their own tents and camping gear, and who are self-sufficient in terms of food. Ndzou has thatched rondavels, tents, a three-bedroom house, restaurant and bar.

He became deputy commander of what was then known as the \\"Iranian Revolutionary Guards\\" shortly after the Iranian Revolution. Kolahdouz was killed, when the Iranian Air Force Lockheed C-130 he was in crashed, near Tehran, in 1981; also killed in the crash of C-130H 5-8552 was the Minister of Defence and other high-ranking officers. In his memory a street in Tehran is named after him. Birthday He was born in Ghouchan, Mashhad. His mother family originally were from Armenia and immigrate to Iran in 1923. Azizeh, the mother of Yousef, was the third children of her family. Hasan, father of Yousef, had a store in Ghouchan When Yousef went to joveini high school, since that he interested in regularity and orders in nature, he chose the major of Mathematics-physics in high school. He was interested in art and painting. Yousef was very active in cultural affairs such that built a library with the aim of his teacher. Also, he participated in theater group. He was a basketball player. After getting diploma, he went to enroll in the faculty of Army officers. Officer faculty He went to officer faculty in 1964. He familiarized there with Hasan Aghareb Parast. Yousef and Hasan established a council by the name of \\" nobility council\\" in Persian\\"sherafat\\". They deal with problem such as conditions of Masters of faculty and also students. They also considered on the place of military men in society, obeying, ethics in army, the virtue of dying for the sake of country etc. Yousef became familiar with Master Mousa Namjoo. Namjoy suggested to Hasan Aghareb parast to participate in hidden organization. This organization was one of the most complex and fighting before revolutionary of Iran. according to memoires of Muhammad Ali Sharif, Mousa Namjoo insisted to cause Yousef to go in Imperial Guard (Iran).hamshahri newspaper,p12,number:6356, Tuesday, 31st Shahrivar 1393 solar Kolahdouz was missioned to form the group of ones who are loyal to Ruhollah Khomeini in Army organization. Shiraz Yousef went to shiraz to spend the armorial initial center in 1965. After a while, Hasan married with the sister of Yousef. Yousef trained about two-month period in England Chieftain tank. He also accepted the responsibility of spying and reporting of Hasan Aghareb Parast because the intelligence service of that time was suspicious to him. . \\"There is no miscase and first lieutenant Hasan Aghareb parast is so loyal to his country and Shah\\" said by first lieutenant Yousef kolahdouz. He married Zahra Mouzarani in the summer of 1973. Tehran-Imperial Guard (Iran) Kolahdouz in Imperial Army uniform Yousef went to Tehran in 1974. he was selected as member of Imperial Guard (Iran) there. He was familiar with Ali Zabetian, a religious man and officer. Yousef and his family, by guiding of Ali Zabetain, could rent an apartment in Tehran. the intelligence service of that time, described Yousef as Dianthus, in Persian by the name of \\"Gole Mikhak\\". Later, Yousef alongside with Toutiani participated more in political activity against shah regime by the aim of overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty. He also was familiar with Hassan Ayatan Iranian Shia theologian and politician.During the Ashura days in 1979 Iran, Kolahdouz took part in political activity against Shah such that designed as schema against the operation of repressing of demonstrators. This schema was to execute forcing group in Imperial Guard (Iran). This group also designed a plan for assassinating the high rank officers of shah. During the Lavizan event, killed approximately seventy of officers by corporation of Kolahdouz and his old men namely Hasan zadeh and Omidi abed. the news on this important event distributed by Kolahdouz amongst media. This enterprise led to lose the repressing operation. Kolahdouz along with Namjoo and Hasan Aghareb Parast comprised the first committee in welcoming to Ruhollah Khomeini. They also talked on conditions of Army in committee. One of the most important discussion was on disbundment of Army. Revolution and victory it was near the victory of Iranian Revolution of Iran. Yousef assigned to preserve of arsenal of Lavizan infrastructure. since that time the establishment of revolutionary Guard of Iran planned. The first place planned the establishment of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was welcome committee of Khomeini in early days of revolution. After that. A military committee manages to disestablish the Army. Establishment of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Kolahdouz believed that despite the Army, Iran need to a revolutionary force which preserve of Khomeini and revolution. according to Khomeini's order to Lahouti, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was established. Yousef early was in charge of training of forces in the IRGC. First he designed three programs on training: three-month program for laymen, one-year program for ones who intend to manage, three-year program for ones who intend to be masters and staffs. Three years programs led to the establishment of Imam Hussein university. Kolahdouz later tried to write the doctrine of IRGC with the help of three ones.

It is endemic to Pilate Lake.  Discovery  The Chirocephalus marchesonii was observed for the first time in 1954 by Vittorio Marchesoni, director of the Botanical Institute of the University of Camerino, during an excursion. New samples were studied in 1957 by Ruffo and Vesentini, who established that it was a new species of crustacean. Chirocephalus name is in tribute to his first discoverer Vittorio Marchesoni.  Description  left Chirocephalus marchesonii stands out easily from other branchiopods thanks to its long, approximately cylindrical body as well as its lack of a shell. Its body, which presents an obvious metamerism, is divided into three sections: head, thorax equipped with eleven pairs of appendices/fins which also have a breathing function, and abdomen which contains the reproductive organs: an egg sac in the female, and two penises of the same length in the male. These crustaceans, whose distinctive feature is that they swim on their backs, form part of the zooplankton. They move by making swinging movements of the appendices along the rib cage. Their swimming position seems to derive from a positive phototropism. The species has a characteristic coral red coloring. The size ranges for both sexes between 9 and 12 mm. The eggs are spherical in shape and compared to other similar species found in Italy (C. kerkyrensis, C. salinus, C. sibyllae, C. diaphanous and C. ruffoi) are among the largest, with an average diameter of 0.43 mm. Chirocephalus marchesonii has an anamorphic development, where the embryo opens as a Nauplius larva, only reaching adult shape after a series of gradual morphological modifications, while new sections and appendices are gradually added. Its biological cycle is synchronized and totally dependent on the annual hydrological cycle of Pilate Lake, generally between the beginning of June and the end of September.  Habitat and behaviour Pilate Lake One of the principal characteristics of the anostraca consists in their adaptability to environments subjected to strong seasonal stress. The environment is often made of temporary water pockets and of little aquatic ponds characterized by a total temporary lack of water and going through extreme phases (draining/freezing) and (or) by fluctuations of the water level and as a result by strong wavering of the physic-chemical factors. In order to face up these kinds of difficulties, the Chirocephalus produce a form of resistance called cyst, inside of which the embryo is stopped at the stage of gastrulation, is isolated by a protective partition which allows it to keep its vitality until the moment when the ideal conditions for its development recreate themselves until the hatching.  Preservation  The cysts are left season after season and do not all hatch out, a part stays in the sediment which constitutes de facto a stock and an extra guarantee for the species survival. The protection of the biotope is primordial because the life of the species under its adult form only goes for several months, whereas the cysts which are produced stay vital for many years if the anthropic factors do not disrupt the sediments where they build up. The most important risk is particularly related to the climatic changes in progress. The ecosystem of altitude such as the Pilate Lake one is characterized by specific climatic conditions which make it particularly vulnerable to high temperatures. The Pilate Lake is considered as a relic zone which, by its climatic and orographic conditions, constitutes a real refuge housing which keeps giving the necessary conditions to the survival of every species which populate it, among them the Chirocephalus marchesonii, stenothermic species of low temperature. If the forecasts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reinforce, the species could disappear from now until a few decades.

After twelve weeks, abortions are only legal in Cambodia when they will save the woman's life or preserve her health, the pregnancy is a result of rape, or the child may be born with an incurable disease. In any of these instances, at least two medical personnel must approve the abortion.  Abortion Law in Cambodia (1997)  Abortion is legal in Cambodia up to twelve weeks of pregnancy under the law of 1997. If the woman seeks an abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy, it is only allowed under certain conditions: a) if there are chances that the pregnancy/fetus is not developing normally or continuation of the pregnancy poses a threat to the woman's life b) if the fetus has developed a disease that cannot be cured or (c) if the unintended pregnancy is the result of rape. In the above stances, ‚Äúeither 2 or 3‚Äù doctors must approve these cases for the abortion to take place. It is mandatory to have the consent or permission from the woman seeking an abortion, for abortion. The abortion can only be carried out by \\"medical doctors, medical practitioners or midwives\\" who are authorized from the Ministry of Public Health.  Abortion stigma in Cambodia  Though abortion is legal in Cambodia, an unmarried woman seeking an abortion is looked down upon. Women are expected not to indulge in sex before marriage and getting pregnant before marriage is frowned upon. Dr Ouk Vong Vathiny, executive director of Reproductive Health Association of Cambodia, told Phenompenhpost, \\"Many women don‚Äôt want to tell anyone because as Buddhists, the community considers it a sin.‚Äù According to a study conducted by BMC, 40 percent every 32 women's deaths reported in Cambodia, resulted from unsafe Abortion. According to another a report by the Guttmacher Institute, abortion, despite being legal in the county, is not widely available because of the shame and stigma attached to it, thus forcing women to opt for alternative unsafe routes like ‚Äúdeep massage abortion‚Äù ‚Äî a traditional practice. Abortion has a history in Cambodia and one of the traditional methods of deep massage abortion - where pressure is applied to a pregnant woman's stomach to abort the fetus, can be seen in one of the stone carvings in the 12th century temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The next carving shows that the same woman and the people who helped her in terminating the pregnancy by massage of abdomen, are condemned to ‚Äòunderworld‚Äù. The bas-relief sculptures in Angkor Wat, Cambodia are the first ever known of an abortion in progress. Experts describe the deep massage abortion methods as high risk as it causes hemorrhage and severe bleeding to the woman who is seeking an abortion by this method.

(abbreviated as APSMHC or simply Pesante Hospital) is now a 98-bed capacity tertiary PhilHealth accredited private hospital located in Midsayap, Cotabato that caters the health needs of the people of PPALMA area. Background Anecito Trestiza Pesante, Sr., lived modestly with his family in the medium-sized town of Midsayap, Cotabato, then with a population of only 84,041. They run a family-owned sari-sari store that sells dry goods and manage a farm. The family had strong ties with the rural community; one that depended on land for livelihood. Farming wasn‚Äôt a particularly lucrative business, soothe people would purchase goods from then Pesante Store using barter system, during harvest season, the family acquired money in exchange for chickens and vegetables. Janet Pesante recalls an instance of complaining to her father that it was too hot and they need to buy an electric fan, ‚Äúyou could live without a fan, but not without an education‚Äù her father whipped. Their father‚Äôs strong emphasis on the importance of education couldn‚Äôt be doubted for he have sent his children to private schools despite of tremendous financial challenge that paid big dividends. In 1985, Evelyn Pesante, the second child completed her medical school and opened a small clinic in their house in November 1986. A few months later, due to the high demand for hospital services and the increase number of patients, the clinic was moved to a bigger and more strategic location in the public market area. She called her new place as Holy Family Medical Clinic, named after her college dormitory and the street of the former subdivision she lived in. The clinic catered mostly for consultations, as there were only five midwives. Meanwhile, Mr. Pesante Sr., with his background in running a business, was in- charge in the records and accounting section of the clinic. It has only five beds, later upgraded to eight beds available for patients who needed to be admitted. Dr. Evelyn Pesante, who understood the importance of education as much as her father did, worked hard to help send her siblings to school. Eventually, Mr. Pesante Sr. became ill with cancer, the sickness that took his life in 1989. As he lay on his deathbed, he called each of his children to his bedside to leave his last request and wish. Once completed, he was at peace to die. In 1995, a huge destructive fire in the public market site affected the operation of the clinic. At the same year, Ramon Pesante, the third child, finished his medical school. He trained at Cotabato Regional and Medical Center, where he specialized in surgery. With the combined efforts of Dr. Evelyn Pesante and Dr. Ramon Pesante, they henceforth moved back to their house, in which they developed to establish the Pesante Surgical and Medical Emergency Clinic. It has a laboratory, an emergency room, an operation room, a delivery room and a capacity of fifteen to twenty beds, but it had remained a clinic that was only for admissions, consultations, and out-patients at that time. In the year 2000, due to the Department of Health‚Äôs stringent requirements, the clinic did not get the permission to upgrade to a primary hospital. This was also the time when Dr. Ramon Pesante started to settle with his own family; he put up his own clinic where he performs minor surgical procedures. Hence, Dr. Evelyn Pesante also had her own humble clinic that could attend patients for observation for at least twenty-four hours; after this they referred to higher hospitals when necessary. The three youngest children, Alex, Janet, and Ron Pesante all became Registered Nurses and moved to the United States. On one of their vacation to their hometown, the family gathered and talk about the idea of construction of the hospital that their late father wished for on his deathbed. Since, for a family of medical professionals, it only made sense they couldn‚Äôt have been better way for them to serve their community. This was when they started planting the seed that would grow to be the Anecito T. Pesante, Sr. Memorial Hospital, Co. that stands today. The three children abroad, worked hard to fund the hospital. In December 2005, marks the start of construction with the demolition of the family‚Äôs ancestral house building. The original plan was to build only two- storey hospital, but they trashed this and went on to build a four-storey hospital, having realized the need for a bigger hospital in PPALMA area that would serve more people. This idea was especially fuelled when the floor plan for the hospital was finally approved by the Department of Health in Manila. The construction took a short hiatus due to financial constrains, but roughly after three years, the first three storeys were finished, opening to the public on May 8, 2008 with hospital instruments and equipments came on the way from the States.

The 256th overall episode, it was written and directed by series co-creator and co-star Trey Parker. The episode premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on December 3, 2014. The episode is part one of the two-part season finale. The episode lampoons the popularity of Internet Let's Play celebrities and the phenomena of Internet trending topics that lack actual relevance. The episode also references and intertwines multiple elements from previous episodes in the eighteenth season of South Park. YouTuber PewDiePie plays himself in this episode. Plot Kyle rushes home to play video games and bond with his brother Ike. However, Ike is not interested, as he is instead watching a video of Internet celebrity PewDiePie offering video game commentary online, a practice known as Let's Play (LP). Kyle is perplexed that Ike and other children seem to be entertained more by rehashed content. Despite Kyle's dismissal of LP, Cartman soon takes up the hobby himself, offering commentary on videos he recorded of Kyle and Stan, which infuriates Kyle, in particular because among Cartman's subscribers is Ike. Meanwhile, Randy Marsh learns of an upcoming local benefit concert that will feature a roster of top pop musicians, including his female stage persona, Lorde. Randy calls his producer to refuse to play the concert, due to his reliance on pitch correction software, but the producer reminds Randy that he needs the money due to his son Stan's spending on freemium gaming. Reluctantly, Randy decides to appear at the concert when his daughter, Shelly Marsh, expresses a desire to see her idol, Lorde in concert, because, as Shelly explains, Lorde is \\"real\\". Backstage at the concert, Randy again hesitates to go on stage, but his producer tells him that the audience does not care what singers sound like, telling Randy, \\"Just go out there and pump your hips and rub your clit.\\" When Randy says that that is not what his music is about, Iggy Azalea perceives this as self-importance on Randy's part, and gets into a brief altercation with him. Later, when Azalea performs with a hologram of Michael Jackson, Randy feels like something is being \\"lost\\" by rehashing dead celebrities. Kyle invites Ike's friends over to his house to play video games, but all of them are watching various video game commentary channels on their mobile devices in Ike's bedroom. When told that video games should be played in the living room, the children dismiss Kyle and Stan as out-of-touch \\"grandpas\\", while Stan is convinced that his own generation is superior to theirs, and Kyle perceives his living room to be \\"dying\\". When Randy's performance begins, his off-key singing and poor live performance turn the fans against him. He accidentally sets the Michael Jackson hologram free, and then rubs his groin in an attempt to win the audience back, but this only makes them angrier and leads to a disillusioned Shelly tearing her Lorde poster off her bedroom wall. When Randy calls his producer, his producer says that pop star fame has never been about music, but the publicity generated by performers' antics, which Randy has now generated. Randy resolves to reveal his identity publicly. Meanwhile, the Jackson hologram is seen on a bus heading toward South Park, because as he explains, he needs to \\"take care of some important business\\". In response to his escape, the company that created him, Syntech Hologram Company, activates their hologram of Tupac Shakur, who steals a car and goes out in pursuit of Jackson. Randy meets with his producer to tell him that he will reveal publicly that he is Lorde. The producer responds that artists are merely exploited to generate revenue, and that a hologram of Lorde will appear on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and will expose her anus to create more publicity. Seeing Randy as an obstacle to this plan, the producer's henchmen attempt to restrain Randy, but Randy escapes to his home. When he tells his wife Sharon this, she is incredulous that she just slept with a hologram, though the hologram turns out to be Shakur's, and not Randy's. Randy's producer conspires with Cartman to install Cartman as the leader in an upcoming social revolution involving holograms. Production Trey Parker and Matt Stone said on the DVD audio commentary that this episode was originally two separate episodes, one about PewDiePie and one about Lorde. This plan did not materialize because they couldn't figure out an ending that would be long enough to fill up the time for either show. To rectify this, they intended to put them together to make one episode. However, this didn't work either because Parker had written a lot of good material and now felt it needed to be a three-part story arc episode. They considered actually doing this but expected problems with Comedy Central. After shifting back and forth between one episode and three episodes, they finally settled on two partway through the production cycle. In hindsight, they thought it would have been better off if they made it a three-part story. The scene in which Randy/Lorde is at the concert and gets into a fight with Iggy Azalea was originally going to be used as the final scene for \\"The Cissy\\", the third episode of this season. This idea was scrapped with the intention to use it later; it was used in this episode, but with a few modifications. Sia was originally present but was at some point removed and Randy was going to get in a fight with everyone else, not just one person. The PewDiePie story originated from Parker having similar experiences to Kyle that he had with his step-son. Another influence of the story was the fact that Parker and Stone felt that more people experienced South Park: The Stick of Truth, their video game, through PewDiePie than by actually buying and playing the game themselves. They thought it would be fun to \\"rip\\" on this. Parker and Stone said that making this episode, and the second part, made them feel old, mainly because the episodes deal with newer things that young people are interested in, such as new technology, pop music, and the focus on Internet. This is also where the title came from; things like Twitter, YouTube Let's Play, and the Internet in general, sometimes feel like places where all people do is \\"rehash each other's shit\\", an opinion that is shared by several characters in the episode. Reception The episode received a B+ rating from The A.V. Club's Eric Thurn, who commented \\"at first this seemed like a pretty good, if also a bit scatter-brained episode of South Park\\", but praised the continuity shown in both this episode and the entire season. Max Nicholson from IGN gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10, stating \\"in terms of sheer meta- ness, this week's #Rehash was off the charts.\\" Chris Longo from Den of Geek gave the episode 2.5 out of 5 stars and called it \\"an episode that throws a lot of fun ideas at us with nothing to balance them out.\\" References External links *\\"Episode 1809 '#REHASH' Press Release\\".

It sponsors an annual literary prize, the Prix Cazes, named for a previous owner. History On , L√©onard Lipp and his wife P√©tronille opened the brasserie on the Boulevard Saint-Germain. Their speciality was a cervelat r√©moulade starter, then choucroute garnie, served with the finest beers. The brasserie's atmosphere and its modest prices made it a great success. Anti-German sentiment during the First World War led to a change of name to Brasserie des Bords for several years. Of Alsatian origin, Lipp left Alsace when it became part of Germany. In July 1920, the bougnat (Paris immigrant) Marcellin Cazes redesigned the brasserie, which had become frequented by poets such as Paul Verlaine and Guillaume Apollinaire. He decorated it with tiled murales by L√©on Fargues, with painted ceilings by Charly Garrey, and purple moleskin seating. In 1955, Cazes passed the baton to his son Roger. On 29 October 1965, Mehdi Ben Barka, a Moroccan anti-monarchy politician opposed to King Hassan II, was abducted by the Morocco Secret Service in front of the brasserie, probably with the help of the French. The Ben Barka Affair became a political scandal which fundamentally changed France‚ÄìMorocco relations. Since 1990, the brasserie has been progressively developed by the Bertrand family of Auvergne, owners of the Angelina tea house, of fast food chain Bert's and of the Sir Winston pub chain.

The cast and crew had to deal with a number of obstacles, including crew members who got sick, paperwork, actors who were injured, a limited budget, and the prejudices of some Vietnamese people against the director, Linh Nga, because she was a woman and only 20 years old. Another challenge was travelling across Vietnam to film the S√≥c TrƒÉng pagoda scenes. Parts of the film, mainly Buddhist scenes near the end, were shot in the ancient temples of S√≥c TrƒÉng. Themes Xuoi nguoc duong tran sought to recover the voices of Vietnamese women. Its creators cast a wide net in their effort to share, understand, and include women's experiences, points of view, and positions in traditional Vietnamese life.

His Odissi style is robust and unique. He was a recipient of the 1977 Sangeet Natak Akademi Award. and 1974 Odisha Sangeet Natak Akademi Award. Biography Deba Prasad Das was born in 1932 in a Karana family at a small village near Cuttack called Keul Chabi Sua, in the Indian state of Odisha to Indramani Devi and Durga Charan Das, a police officer. He lost his mother at an early age and was brought up by his grandfather who was a local violin player. Das did his early schooling at Puri and started picking up music and dance at the age of six from a nearby traditional school (Pathara Akhara) run by Mohan Chandra Mohapatra. However, he had to move to Behrampur when his father was transferred there. When Das was 14, his father sent him to the music school of Radha Raman Ray, a music director working with New Theatres. He worked there for a monthly salary of approximately 3 plus food and assisted the performers in the green room. Soon, he worked his way up as a gate man, a ticket collector and finally as a prompter. The break came when Guru Pankaj Charan Das and later, Moha Mohapatra started associating themselves with the New theatre and Das got a small role, appearing only at the beginning of the dance cramas. Later, when New Theatres closed down in 1949, he moved to Annapurna and worked there for a few years where he had the opportunity to work alongside the renowned Odissi exponents such as Pankaj Charan Das, Kelucharan Mohapatra, Kumar Dayal Sharan and Mayadhar Raut. Annapurna also became defunct by 1953 by which time Deb Das had already mastered the dance form of Odissi. The next move was to Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya, a school of dance music, where Das joined as a faculty member for Odissi in 1964. Here, he tutored Indrani Rahman a Bharatanatyam dancer at that time, whom he taught Odissi. and the association with Rahman brought Das into public notice when the Rahman took her guru along with her for concerts. In 1957, Indrani Rahman presented an Odissi demonstration choreographed by Deba Prasad Das at the Dance Festival and this performance is reported to have assisted Odissi to be taken notice as a classical dance form. Later, in the same year, Rahman made her debut performance of Odissi at a show witnessed by Kapila Vatsyayan, Charles Fabri and others, and this is known to have brought the Deba Das style of Odissi into public notice.'Sabda Swara Pata' is an important feature of this style of Odissi. Das, a representative of Gotipua Odissi culture and considered by many as one of the four first generation gurus of Odissi, is known to be founder of the Deba Prasad Gharana. He had many disciples such as Indrani Rahman, Bijayalaxmi Mohanty, Oopali Operajita, Pushpa Mahanti, Srinath Raut, Sudhakar Sahoo, Durga Charan Ranbir, Dhuleswar Behera, Anita Singhdeo, Sangeeta Dash, Sujata Mishra, Ramli Ibrahim, Gajendra Panda, Manoj Behera, Gopa Biswhas, Gayatri Chand, Atashi Tripathy are among many others who have emerged as noted exponents of Odissi. Notable Bharatanatyam guru Leela Ramanathan had also taken Odissi training under him. He has also choreographed many dance dramas and solo numbers. Deba Prasad Das died on 16 July 1986, aged 54. Awards and recognitions Recipient of Senior Research Fellowship from the Government of India, Deba Prasad Das also received the World Development Corporation award in 1983 and the Odisha Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1974. Sangeet Natak Akademi honored him with their annual award in 1977.

Bagaran () is a village in the Armavir Province of Armenia near the Armenia‚ÄìTurkey border. Its name is derived from the nearby ancient Armenian city of Bagaran which was a large city and fortress that straddled both banks of the Akhurian River, and served as a former capital of medieval Armenia.Hakobyan, Tatul. \\"After years of isolation, the ancient capitals of Yervandashat and Bagaran are now open to visitors .\\" Armenian Reporter. April 10, 2009. A small Kurdish-populated village called Kƒ±lƒ±tta≈üƒ± now partially lies on the Turkish side of the closed border. History =Ancient and medieval= According to the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi, Bagaran was founded during the 3rd century BC by king Orontes IV of Armenia.Hewsen, Robert H., \\"Bagaran Bagaran.\\" Iranica. It quickly became the religious centre of Armenia, replacing Armavir as the main spiritual site of the Orontid pagan temples.Armenian encyclopaedia After fall of Orontid Dynasty and the rise of Artaxiad dynasty, king Artaxias I moved all the pagan monuments from Bagaran and relocated them in his newly built capital of Artashat, founded in 176 BC. During the second half of the sixth century, Bagaran along with the entire canton of Arsharunik became the property of the Kamsarakan princes. The Church of Saint Theodore built between 624 and 631, was one of the main landmarks of Bagaran. Inscriptions on the church of Saint Theodore of Bagaran were located at the exterior of the entire building, starting at the northern face of the western apse and running across the northern, eastern and southern faces. Orbeli, Joseph, –ò–∑–±—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Ç—Ä—É–¥—ã. Yerevan, 1963, p. 390. The Bagratunis took over the city during the eighth century. In 895, after the establishment of the Kingdom of Armenia, Bagaran became the capital of an independent Armenia under king Ashot I. His successor king Smbat I moved the capital Bagaran to Shirakavan in 890. Under the Bagratid rule, Bagaran remained one of the prosperous centers of the Armenian kingdom. Many members of the Bagratuni rulers, including Ashot I, were buried in Bagaran.Manuk-Khaloyan, Armen, \\"In the Cemetery of their Ancestors: The Royal Burial Tombs of the Bagratuni Kings of Greater Armenia (890-1073/79),\\" Revue des √âtudes Arm√©niennes 35 (2013): pp. 134-42. However, in 1045, Bagaran along with the Armenian capital Ani was invaded by the Byzantines. In 1064, the city was attacked and heavily destroyed by the Seljuk Turks. During the 12th century, the Shah-Armens took over Bagaran. In 1211, Bagaran was briefly ruled by the Zakarid princes of Armenia before being invaded by the Mongols in 1236. In 1394, Bagaran was finally destroyed by Tamerlane.Bagaran, one of the 13 capitals of Armenia =Modern= Saint Theodore Church of Bagaran, before 1923 At the beginning of the twentieth century, there was an Armenian- populated village near the site of ancient Bagaran with a population of slightly over 300. In 1920, as a result of the Armenian Genocide, the territories of Republic of Armenia located west of the Akhurian River were captured by Turkey. The small group of the Armenian survivors of Bagaran, crossed the river and founded the modern village of Bagaran within the Armenian SSR, just 8 km south of the site of the ancient city. According to the Armenian historian Joseph Orbeli, the Church of Saint Theodore of Bagaran was one of the most important examples of early medieval Armenian architecture. It was largely intact before 1920 but is now entirely destroyed.  Health  Bagaran has a health post where women are offered free health screenings.

It is located at Middleport, Stoke-on-Trent, England.Middleport Pottery The buildings, which still house an active pottery, are protected for their historic interest. Middleport Pottery is owned and operated by Re-Form Heritage. History Middleport Pottery has been described as a ‚Äúmodel pottery\\" of the Staffordshire pottery industry at the time of its construction. Its scale and linear organisation contrast with the constricted sites and haphazard layout of traditional potteries such as the Gladstone Pottery Museum.Stoke on Trent Historic Buildings Survey; Baker D: Potworks: London: 1991-: P.89-93). It was designed to make all production processes more efficient and to improve conditions for the workforce. The passageways between the ranges were just wide enough for a cart to get through, and for the easy movement of workers and pottery. Finished pottery was placed (using the crane next to the packing house) straight onto barges on the Trent and Mersey Canal waiting to take the ceramics out to the coast for international export. Alternatively they were sent out by horse and cart via the road. The Boulton steam engine powered the machinery for mixing clay and continued to be in use until the coal strike of the 1970s. It was fed by a large boiler that also provided steam for heating and drying pottery. Middleport Pottery had many pre-eminent designers over the years. Charlotte Rhead worked there from 1926-1931 producing her exquisite tube-lined designs, and David Copeland worked at the pottery in the 60s, bringing new modern designs while still using traditional copperplate engraving skills. Conservation status of Middleport Pottery The pottery was given listed building status in the 1970s. By this time six of the seven bottle ovens on the site had been demolished. The surviving bottle oven was given its own listing. In 1988 the course of the Trent and Mersey Canal through Stoke-on-Trent was designated a linear conservation area. =Urban decay= English Heritage put the canal conservation area on the \\"Conservation Areas at Risk\\" register in 2010, in large part because of urban decay caused by the decline of traditional industries. A 2011 review of the conservation area noted that Middleport Pottery was a building at risk. The Prince‚Äôs Regeneration Trust / Re-Form Heritage involvement In 2010 the pottery was acquired by Denby Holdings Limited, the parent company of the well-known UK ceramics and consumer goods manufacturer Denby Pottery. In 2011 Middleport Pottery was at serious risk of closure because of the very poor state of repair of the buildings. This would have seen the loss of jobs and substantial buildings of historic significance would have been left to further degenerate. In the same year Re-Form Heritage stepped in to buy and save the buildings and began a ¬£9 million project to revitalise them. After Re-Form Heritage bought the site Denby Pottery continued to operate in the factory as a tenant. The production of Burleigh Pottery has continued uninterrupted at the site since it opened in 1889. The restoration work was led by Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios and included a varied and extensive programme of training and educational activities to support the local community in skills provision with an emphasis on traditional British craftsmanship. The pottery opened to the public as a visitor destination in July 2014 following the three-year regeneration. The restoration enabled Burleigh Pottery to remain on-site, saving local jobs and craftsmanship. In total the restoration has saved 50 local jobs and created 70 more. The unused buildings have been developed to provide attractive accommodation for workshops, enterprise space, craft and community areas, a cafe, a gallery and a heritage visitor centre. Today Following renovations, Middleport Pottery was opened to visitors in 2014. The pottery has enjoyed rising visitor numbers, and a number of businesses are based at the site. Burleigh Pottery is still produced at the site using traditional craftsmanship. The Old Packing House was refurbished and became the new Prince of Wales Studios that is open as a business home for craftspeople to work and exhibit their products. The Princes Regeneration Trust granted ¬£200,000 to the Pottery towards the conversion and Prince Charles (the Prince of Wales) helped open the Studios in January, 2016, including unveiling some signs; .Studios opened by Prince Charles https://staffslive.co.uk/2016/01/prince-charles- opens-new-pottery-studios-burslem/ Since it opened as a visitor destination, the pottery has won eight awards: a RIBA National Award for architectural excellence; three RIBA West Midlands Awards; a Europa Nostra Award for heritage; a Civic Trust AABC Conservation Award for building conservation; a Placemaking Award for heritage; and a Heritage Open Days‚Äô Community Champions Award.

After the murder of Ghislaine Marchal, Marchal's gardener Omar Raddad was arrested. Defended at his trial by Jacques Verg√®s, Raddad was convicted 1994, and sentenced to 18 years in prison. Raddad always maintained his innocence. Raddad received a partial pardon from French President Jacques Chirac in 1996 at the request of Moroccan King Hassan II, which reduced his sentence to 4 years and 8 months, and was released from prison in 1998. The misspelled sentence \\"Omar m'a tuer\\" (\\"Omar killed me\\"), found written in blood at the crime scene, became a widely used phrase in French society during the 1990s. The last word of the sentence is not properly conjugated; it should read: \\"Omar m'a tu√©e\\". Skeptics contended that this is an odd mistake for a native French speaker to make. The mistake is understandable, however, since both tuer and tu√©e are pronounced [ty.e]. The case was the subject of the 2011 film Omar m'a tuer by Roschdy Zem.  Description of the events  = The facts = Born Ghislaine de Renty, Ghislaine Marchal was the daughter of an industrialist who was engaged in the Resistance during the Second World War and died in deportation. Divorced from her first husband, with whom she had a son, in 1991 she was the wealthy widow of Jean-Pierre Marchal, owner of a famous company that supplied equipment for automobiles,, in nouvelobs, 1 August 2010. and sister-in-law of the president of the Paris Bar Council Bernard de Bigault du Granrut. She split her time between her main house in Switzerland and her villa La Chamade, which she had built in the hills of Mougins. = Ghislaine Marchal disappeared = On Sunday 23 June 1991, around 11:48am, Ghislaine Marchal, having just got out of the shower, is chatting on the phone with her friend Erika S. She has planned for her friend to come to La Chamade for lunch on monday morning. Ghislaine Marchal tells her she is in a hurry as she needs to get ready to have lunch at her friends' Mr and Mrs K.'s house at 1pm. They end their conversation at 11:50. This will be the last time that her voice was heard by those close to her. Surprised that she hadn't arrived, her friends called her in vain several times from 13:30 onwards. Around 6, Colette K. drove to La Chamade. She rang the doorbell but nobody answered, nor did they to another phone call she made that evening. On Monday 24 June, Erika S. arrived at 11:30, as planned. She rang, rang again, called, all in vain. Alerted by Mrs Erika S. and Mrs Colette K., a third friend, Francine P., sent an employee of the security company to the house in the early afternoon. The house, dark and silent, shows no trace of a break in, the blinds had only been drawn in the bedroom; on the unmade bed were glasses, a diary; the breakfast tray is in the kitchen. The keys are in the door, which remains unlocked, the alarm is not activated. It seemed as though Ghislaine Marchal had just woken up, but she wasn't there. Throughout the afternoon, the searching begins; the security company employee returns with Francine P. and her attendant. They are quickly joined by Ghislaine Marchal's doctor. They find jewelry, an open hand bag, which doesn't contain any cash, but no trace of the owner. = The cellar door is blocked from inside = Finally, on 24 June 1991 in the evening, the police are alerted and arrive at the house. After searching the house, they become interested in an annexe to the main house. A flight of stairs descends to the cellar, which had not been visited as of yet, and of which the metal door is locked. After unlocking it, the door would still not open any more than 2 cm. One officer pushed with all his might as another feeds his arm through the gap and identifies a folding bed placed against the door on the inside. He manages to violently push it backwards: the door opens a little bit more, but a metal tube, placed on the ground perpendicularly to the door, firmly blocks it on its hinges. The door was warped and twisted by the officer's pushing, enabling him to get a leg through the gap and kicking the tube several times. The final kicks shifts the tube, enabling him to open the door. In January 1992, investigators note that the pressure on the door made the tube move, leaving a semi circular imprint on the cement floor. = Discovery of the body = At the back of the cellar, Ghislaine Marchal is lying face down, her legs pointing to the bag wall, her arms stretched out in front of her on the ground, dressed in only a blood stained bath robe pulled up to above her waist. The doctor's first observations on the evening of the 24th, and the autopsy of 28 June revealed severe injuries: 5 violent blows to the head, carried out with a rafter, to kill and not to knock her out which caused open cuts on her head and cerebral edema, a V shaped cut on her throat, which missed the trachea and the big arteries of the neck; ten cuts on her thorax and on the abdomen, caused by a double edged tapered blade measuring 15 to 20cm long, and maximum of 2cm wide, which provoked an eventration and three cuts into the liver; two into her left thigh, one of which produced a thin stream of blood perpendicular to the axle of the leg; the victim thus lay on the floor immobile after having received this injury, for at least long enough for the blood to coagulate, approximately 7 minutes. Injuries and fractures of the hands, a phalange almost ripped off, suggest that she looked to protect herself by bringing her hands to her face, several scrapes on her arms and legs, in particular on the soles of her feet and the back of her knees, as well as traces of dust and cement on her robe suggest that the victim had been dragged on the ground. Forensic experts note that it had not been possible to determine the order in which the blows were delivered. None of them were immediately fatal, but were after approximately 15 to 30 minutes of agony. Captain Georges Cenci notes that the assassin seemed 'determined, but also clumsy in his movements'. Doctor Jean Pagliuzza, forensic doctor, who had been consulted by the defense lawyers accepted to give his advice to journalist Eve Livet after the gardener was sentenced. He thinks that the murder could have happened in a rapid sequence of only 3 to four minutes. In this type of attack, the first blows have the intention of neutralising the victim by stunning her. After this, the blows carried out with a white weapon follow, very quickly. 'Taking into account the force of the blows, her aggressor was a man [...] he was left handed'. He indicates that the lowest injury was the first to be made. 'The blade hit higher and higher the more the victim collapsed'. The V shaped injury on her neck 'is often found in this type of murder' because of the lateral movement of the head, looking to escape the blows to the neck. The expert specifies that the attacker must certainly have received blood on him. Given the way the blood flowed following this, he estimates that the victim never got up; she died 'rapidly from bleeding'. If she had stood up, the haemorrhage of the liver would have filled the abdominal cavity, something which was not observed by forensic scientists. = Discovery of the inscriptions 'Omar killed me' = The cellar's metal door opens onto a hallway. On the left 'Omar m'a tuer' is written in blood, in well formed letters, one meter above ground level, on a locked white door leading to the wine cellar. A bloody trace is visible under the inscription. In front of the metal door, at the back of the main room, the sentence is partially written again on the door of the boiler room: 'Omar m'a t'. This 'second inscription' as the investigators called it, lower than the first, is barely legible. It is situated on the boiler room's side of the door, but because the door is blocked open, it is facing the entrance of the room and not the boiler room, where the body is.

Criminal conviction In 2009, Rosenberg was arrested, extradited to the United States, and pleaded guilty for participating in a telemarketing lottery fraud. As part of a plea bargain, she was sentenced to four years in prison in a Manhattan federal court, but later her sentence was reduced before being deported to Israel. Joining the Kurds Rosenberg gained international press coverage as the first foreign woman to join Kurds battling the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Syria or Iraq. According to an interview with Kol Yisrael (Israel Radio) quoted by The Jerusalem Post she decided to join the Women's Protection Units, the female counterpart of the People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters, for humanitarian and ideological reasons and \\"because they are our brothers\\" who are fighting evil. Wladimir van Wilgenburg, an analyst for the Jamestown Foundation said \\"Rosenberg is quite popular among the Kurds, especially those [who] sympathize with Israel‚Äôs national struggle, and the fact that the Israelis/Jews managed to create their own state, something which a lot of Kurdish nationalists aspire to.\\" The Jerusalem Post stated that upon return to Israel she would be arrested and prosecuted, as was the case of several Israeli Arabs who joined ISIL and subsequently returned to Israel. The paper pointed out that Rosenberg also breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq, an enemy country, which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter; the Israeli government had also cracked down on those going to fight against Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad. In Canada, Minister of Public Safety Steven Blaney stated that while the government \\"would not oppose a citizen who is willing to engage in a battle for liberty and helping the victims of barbaric crimes,\\" he believed that \\"the best way to fight terrorism is to support our national law enforcement or national security agencies and eventually get involved with them.\\" In late November 2014 militants on social media started claiming that Rosenberg has been captured, along with several other female fighters by ISIL perhaps during the Siege of Koban√Æ. This was denied by Kurdish officials who said she was nowhere near Koban√Æ. On December 1, Rosenberg updated her Facebook page, saying that she was safe. If captured, she would have been the second Israeli dual citizen, after American-Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff, and the first Canadian, to be held hostage by ISIL. There was also speculation that, if she had been captured, Canada might have mounted a rescue operation to retrieve her. Return to Israel Gill Rosenberg returned to Israel on 12 July 2015 after 6 months in Syria and Iraq.

Biography  He was born February 15, 1964 in Barcelonnette, in the Alps. As a very young man, he came to live in Provence; a region he never left since then. He said by the way that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to live without sun, mistral and cicadas. Married and father of a family, he worked as a primary school teacher for a long time, before turning completely towards writing. Passionate by French literature and convinced of the power of imagination and words, he always dreamed of alternate universes, dragons, magic. He died November 8, 2009. Career He published his first texts at Flammarion, including his first one Amies √† vie, before releasing the Ewilan saga (double trilogy), Le pacte des Marchombres and L‚Äôautre (trilogies), three heroic fantasy series, a genre he especially loved. His love for fantastic literature started early (he still wore short pants), with an intense (he didn‚Äôt sleep for a whole week) meeting with J.R.R. Tolkien, followed by deep and frequent divings into Farmer‚Äôs, Zelazny‚Äôs, Howard‚Äôs, Bradley‚Äôs, Moorcock‚Äôs and Leiber‚Äôs universes, as well as other master magicians. When we asked him from where his inspiration came from, he replied generally about the impact these readings had on his imagination, or even his personality, before adding he never felt like having invented anything:‚Äù I just open the door and the story goes from my mind to my computer‚Äù. Some other projects have seen the light, mostly at Rageot, or were in the making as Bottero spent most of his time writing, while he wasn‚Äôt touring all over France for animations or book fairs. He won the teenager prize (in Rennes, Ille-et-Vilaine) in 2008 for the first volume of L'autre: le souffle de la hy√®ne, released at Rageot. This is a prize given each year by the High school students from the Ille-et-Vilaine department, who choose to vote amongst 10 books. He also received the departmental prize of H√©rault by the students in 6th and 7th grade for Le Pacte des Marchombres (a trilogy dedicated to Ellana, one of the main characters in the series La Qu√™te d'Ewilan and Les Mondes d'Ewilan); and the prize ‚ÄúImaginales‚Äù in 2011 in Epinal for Les √Çmes crois√©es. December 4, 2008, he was awarded the prize of the Paille en Queue (a bird that can be found in La R√©union) on the occasion of the third youth book fair of Indian Ocean in Le Port (La R√©union). As a child, he explained,‚Äù I dreamt of staggering adventures swarming of dangers but I could find the gate to the parallel world! I ended persuading myself this world doesn‚Äôt existed and I dealt with a classic world..until I started to write novels! A flavor of adventure slid down my life.

History After changing its name from Torment, Mefisto was one of the first Swedish extreme bands to follow Bathory. They had a big influence on early Swedish death metal, along with Obscurity as well as Merciless shortly thereafter. Mefisto originally consisted of three members: guitarist Omar Ahmed, drummer Robert \\"Thord\\" Granath, and singer Sandro Cajander. Cajander, who later joined Morbid, had a deep, harsh vocal style comparable to but more extreme than peers Bathory or Venom, which was developed further by LG Petrov of Nihilist (later Entombed). Mefisto released two cassette demos, \\"Megalomania\\" in May 1986 and \\"The Puzzle\\" in November 1986. However, after just two demos Mefisto disbanded in 1987, getting little support. The band has since gained cult status, heavily influencing the upcoming extreme music underground, especially the Stockholm death metal scene. These demos, which were reissued as a compilation CD entitled \\"The Truth\\" on Regain Records in 1999 form a prototype for Swedish death metal. As of December 2014 they have reformed. Their debut album was released on 20 February 2016.

History In 1869 Edward Bates opened a drapery shop in partnership with a Mr Pain at the age of 18. By 1871 the partnership was dissolved and by 1877 the business had grown to four shops. However at the age of 45 in 1896 Edward had died leaving his son Edward II in charge of the business at the age of 24. In 1900 the business moved from the four separate shops to one location at 94-96 High Street, Chatham. Edward II was a campaigner for better working conditions for employees and was co- founder of the Chatham Tradesman Association (now Medway Chambers of Commerce). The business was incorporated in 1921, and a year later Edward III son of Edward II joined the business eventually taking over as Managing Director, a position he held until 1966, when his son Edward IV took over the position. In 1963 the store again moved to new premises at 125 High Street, Chatham, and in 1966 the store became members of the Associated Department Stores group. The business expanded again in 1969 by buying a department store in Maidstone called Blake & Son. The business continued to operate until the late 1970s when first Blake & Son was closed in 1978, and in 1979 Edward Bates was sold to Bentalls department store group.

Finally, it is also important to recognise that the Housing Gap does not take into account existing shortages in building rates. The extra strain caused by the growing Housing Gap will therefore exacerbate the problems the UK already faces on its current housing stock. Research from ShelterShelter, The housing Crisis, 2013 - http://england.shelter.org.uk/campaigns/why_we_campaign/the_housing_crisis for example found that: ‚ÄúThere are a number of aspects that point towards a historic and continued housing shortage, with 1.7 million households waiting for social housing, approximately 650,000 households in England are considered overcrowded, and an further 49,000 households were living in temporary accommodation arranged by local authorities.‚Äù Such pressures only add to the extent of the shortage going forward.

Situated close to the border of Western Australia, approximately north west of Timber Creek and north east of Kununurra. The Victoria River flows through the property. It is bounded by Newry Station and Auvergne Station to the south and by Spirit Hills Station to the north and west, and lies on the traditional lands of the Mariu people. The property occupies an area of and can support a herd of over 9,000 heads of Brahman cattle. The property was established by Raymond Locke who was granted the lease for the area in June 1960 under Pastoral Lease No. 568 over . The lease was known as Bullo River Valley Station and was pioneered by Raymond and Barbara Locke. The Locke family established bores and fencing and had a herd of over 1,000 Shorthorn cattle. They also had an airstrip constructed at a cost of 1,200 pounds. Barbara Locke also served as the President of the Country Women's Association - Ord Valley Air Branch during her time at Bullo. Bullo River was owned by the author Sara Henderson and her husband, an American, Charles Henderson. The Hendersons acquired the property in 1963 from the Lockes and moved to Bullo River the same year, Charles died in 1986 and Sara took over running the property with the help of her three daughters. In 2001 Henderson's oldest daughter, Marlee Ranacher and her husband Franz acquired Bulloo from her mother following a legal battle. In 2011 the property was struggling following the live export ban imposed by the Gillard government. Marlee Ranacher led a protest group to Canberra then returned to Bulloo to place the property on the market. Shortly afterward while aerial mustering her plane's engine failed and she crash landed on a mud-flat before having to swim ashore and activating an emergency beacon. Authorities contacted her husband who picked her up in his helicopter. The insurance paid out on the plane kept the property afloat until market conditions improved. The station was sold in 2015 to Grant Farris who paid 9.5 million for both the leasehold and 7,000 head of cattle. Farris and his partner, Grant McLeary, announced they would be spending another 1 million to redevelop the property for both cattle and tourism.

The Chutiya people are one of the major and earliest section of the plain inhabitants of Assam who have migrated from present-day Southern China. The seat of the Chutias when they were in the ascendant, appears to have been about Lakhimpur and the back of the Subansiri River.

The Chutia community are recognized as an Other Backward Class by the Government of India and are an ethnic Assamese-speaking group.Chutia falls under OBC During the colonial period, the Chutia community had the second largest population in Upper Assam(east of Koliabar).Hamilton, Francis, Account of Assam, p.53, \\"In the parts east from Kaliabor, the tribe next most numerous is called Chutiya.\\" Today, most of them reside in this region of Upper Assam and in Guwahati city. Etymology There are many views to the etymology of the word \\"Chutia\\". *According to writers like Bishnuprasad Rabha, W.B. Brown and Paban Chandra Saikia (in \\"The Dibongiyas\\"), the word Chu-ti-ya is originally derived from the Deori-Chutia language which means natives who live near pure waters. Chu meaning for pure/good, Ti meaning water and Ya meaning for natives of the land. It is essentially similar to the way the terms for the Deori clans (Dibangiya, Tengaponiya or Borgoiya) have originated which means residents (denoted by suffix \\"Ya\\") living near Dibang, Tengapani and Bornoi rivers.Saikia, P.C. The Dibongiyas. 1976, p. 38.Brown, W.B. \\"An outline grammar of the Deori Chutia language\\", p.70.Rabha, Bishnuprasad \\"Rabha Rachanwali(Vol I)\\", 1982, p.336. *The Deodhai Buranji mentions the Chutias as Chutika instead. There is a sloka in the Buranji which reads, The term Chutika is also of Deori-Chutia origins. Chu means good/pureBrown,W.B.,An Outline Grammar Of The Deori Chutiya Language,p.70 and Tika stands for lineage/origins.Rajkumar,S., Chutia, Bhuyan and Matak kingdom,p. 16. Thus, Chu-tika could mean People of good origins. On the other hand, Chu also means pig in the same language and this would link the Chutias (pig origin) to the Varaha lineage as adopted by the Kamarupa kings.Bhuyan, S.K.Deodhai Assam Buranji(Chutia r Kotha).Dept. of Historical and Antiquarian Studies, 1932, p. 5. It is very possible that the origin word Chutika later shortened over time to Chutia. *R.M. Nath in his book \\"Background of Assamese culture\\" claims that the term is derived from chut or \\"mountain top\\", their original place of habitation before settling down in the plains of Upper Assam. But, this is cannot be true as the term \\"Chut\\" doesn't belong to Deori- Chutia language or any other Bodo dialects. Origin There are numerous folklores among the community which points to ancestors Bhirmukka and Subahu- Chutan. The Deodhai Buranji mentions Birpal to be a descendant of Bhirmukka. It also reads \\"Sadiya Korjaku-Desha Chutika-Bansha Bhirmukka\\". As per the Buranji, due to some misfortune (deva-dosha), Birpal had to settle down with 60 Chutia families (around 6000 peopleDutta, Sristidhar, \\"The Mataks and their kingdom\\",p.45.Morans, Borahis, Kacharis and Chutias were the main tribes in the Matak community. As all of them were Bodos in origin, they had a common living pattern too. They lived in joint families. The number of members in a joint family sometimes exceeded one hundred) in a hill named Swarnagiri/Sonagiri in the year 1189 A.D.(1111 saka) and later became lord over other Chutia states like Rangalgiri, Swetagiri, etc. As per another folklore of the Chutia priestly community Deoris, Bhirmukka was the descendant of a king named Subahu-Chutan.Barua, S.L. Chutiya Jatir Buranji. 2004, p. 454. This ancestor can be identified to be the second last king of Bhauma dynasty Subahu.Subahu was the 20th king after Narakasura' The Deoris called the Chutia kingdom as Chutam (Land of Chutias).(IJRSSH) 2013, Vol. No. 2, Issue No. III, Jul-Sep Another folklore prevalent among the community notes a hill by the name of Sotai-Parvat. The folklore states that at a very early time, the plains of Assam was a marshland devastated by frequent floods which made the people settle in the hills. The sky was said to be very close to the ground (probably as it was covered by clouds) and this annoyed the people a lot. One day an old women who knew magic attempted to solve the issue but instead ended up removing the sky completely. This made the place very cold and dark. So, the people migrated from the place and gathered together in a hill named Sotai-Parvat. They stayed there for some time and then shifted to the plains due to some reason. One group crossed a mighty river (probably Brahmaputra) and the other did not. This is how the Chutias scattered around the region. It is interesting to note that there still exists a hill named Sotai pahar in today's Sonitpur district (previously known as Hadappesvara).\\"Sotai Pahar, which is a part of Balipara reserve forest on the western side of the road.\\" Chutia rule (unknown-1523) A 15th century depiction of a Chutia man in warrior attire. The Chutia Kingdom was an early medieval state in eastern Assam on the northern bank of the river Brahmaputra. The kingdom absorbed the ancient Pal dynasty and reigned for over 400 years in northeastern Assam and areas of present-day Arunachal Pradesh, with the capital at Sadiya. The kingdom controlled the entire region of present Assam districts of Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Tinsukia and parts of Jorhat, Dibrugarh, Sonitpur. It was the dominant kingdom in upper Assam till the 16th century in which it expanded from Parshuram Kund in the east to Vishwanath in the west. During the medieval times, the Chutia people were considered to be the most developed group in the northeastern region of India.Guha, Amalendu,The Ahom Political System: An Enquiry into the State Formation Process in Medieval Assam (1228-1714),p.5,\\"The period from 13th to the 16th century saw the emergence and development of a large number of tribal political formations in north-east India. The Chutia, the Tai-ahom, the Koch, the Dimasa, the Tripuri, the Meithei, the Khasi and the Pamar- all these tribes crystallised into rudimentary state formations by the 15th century....The most developed of the tribes in the 15th century were the Chutias.\\" Most illustrious of the Chutia kings was Gaurinarayan (Ratnadhwajpal), son of Birpal. He brought many other Chutia groups into his kingdom. In 1224 Ratnadhwajpal defeated Bhadrasena, the king of Swetagiri. Then he went on to subjugate Nyayapal and marched toward Kamatapur, where he formed an alliance with the Kamata ruler by marrying a princess. Then he marched to Dhaka, and made friends with the Gauda ruler. The hostilities with the Ahoms began when the Chutia Kingdom expanded to the south and during which Ahom king, Sutuphaa, was killed by the Chutia king during a friendly negotiation. This conflict triggered a number of battles between the two sides, which saw great lost of men and money. The simmering dispute often flared till 1523-24 when the Ahoms struck the Chutia Kingdom in its weakest state, they finally took Sadiya and killed the then king Nityapal. The Ahoms established their rule by instituting the position of Sadiyakhowa Gohain, the governor in charge of Sadiya. But the Chutia had dispersed to frontier regions, and continued raids against the Ahoms. It finally ended in 1673, when the Chutias fall under the domination of the Ahoms. Chutia Kekura Dola(Palaquin) donated by king Satyanarayan to the Gharmora Satra. =Gunpowder and Cannons= The Chutias were the first people in Assam to use firearms. When the Ahoms annexed Sadiya, they recovered hand-cannons called HiloiS.K. Bhuyan in his book Assam Buranji,p.24 mentions that the king and his generals started using the among other things, the Hiloi thula Chora Nao(gunboats) after annexing the Chutia countryAs per the Bahgharia Buragohain Buranji, the hand-cannons Hiloi recovered from Sadiya numbered at around seventy-nine.The Assam Buranji(Sukumar Mahanta) and the Deodhai Assam Buranji mentions the number to be 1000 pieces.Hiteswar Borborua in his book Ahomor Dinmentions the firearms procured from Sadiya as Barud as well as large cannons called Bor-top, Mithahulang being one of them.Sharma, Benudhar.Maniram Dewan,p.289.Hiteswar Borborua in his book Ahomor Din p. 451 states that the Ahom king Suhunmgmung acquired the cannon Mitha hulang from the Chutias and initiated the production of firearms in the kingdom Before that the Ahoms weapons included bows and arrows.Barua, Gopal,Chandra,Ahom Buranji,p.57 As per History of Assam by Edward Gait, the first usage of gunpowder by Ahoms date back to their war against Turbak in 1532. Up to this time the Ahoms weapons consisted of swords, spears and bows and arrows. The Chutias were defeated in 1524 which shows that the Ahoms learned the use of gunpowder from the Chutias. This is further corroborated by the fact that all the Hiloidari (cannonmen)Naoboicha Phukanar Buranji,p.55 and majority of Hiloi-Khanikars (gunmakers) belonged to the Chutia community.Dutta, Shristidhar, The Mataks and their kingdom, p. 30. It is believed that the gunpowder and firearms in this part of India was of a better quality than rest of India. It is known that when Mir Jumla went back from Assam he took with him 675 big guns and about 4750 maunds of gunpowder in boxes because they were in much better quality than what they used. A terracotta tile of Bhismaknagar depicting a person with a crossbow or a hand-cannon This is one of the Mithaholong guns which the Ahoms procured after defeating the Chutias. Language The original language of the Chutias belong to the Tibeto-Burman Bodo-Garo languages group, also known by the same name i.e. Chutia. Although, the language is no longer spoken by majority of Chutias, it is well preserved by the Deori people or the priestly section of the group.Brown, W.B. An Outline Grammar of the Deori-Chutiya language. 1933, p.3 . According to W.B.Brown, the Chutia language was the original language of Upper Assam. According to PRT Gurdon(1903), the Deori-Chutia language is very similar to the Moran dialect of Assamese and it can well be stated that the Moran language was nothing but a transitionary language between Chutia and Assamese language for the Chutias, Morans, and a section of Deoris (Tengaponia, Borgoya). After the advent of Prakrit in the Brahmaputra valley, the language of the Chutias evolved and assimilated with the Prakrit language. This was probably the time when the first form of Assamese originated in Upper Assam. The old Chutiya language was preserved by the Deori priestly section. Stone inscription of Chutia king Dharmanarayan dated 1442 A.D. found in Paya-Tamreswari temple. It declares the renovation of the temple using bricks. When the Ahoms arrived in the 13th century, they found the Chutiya language to be a version of localised Prakrit with a Prakrit script. According to Ahom buranjis, this form of Assamese along with the original Chutiya language were the only languages to have a writing script when they arrived. This form of Assamese was then adopted by the Ahom courts and spread throughout the kingdom. They used this to form the Gargaya Assamese used in later Buranjis. The modern written form of Assamese is mostly influenced by the Gargaya branch of Assamese.Yasmin Saikia in her book Assam and India: Fragmented Memories mentioned Sadiya, capital of the Chutiya kingdom to be one of the two important centers of development for the Assamese language. The Chutias may have abandoned their original language due to socio- historical and geographical factors, but many address-oriented terms and other verbs and nouns of the original language are still used by the people in their present Assamese dialect. The address oriented terms which are still prevalent include ‚Äòboba‚Äô or ‚Äòbupai‚Äô (father), ‚Äòyoi‚Äô or ‚Äòaio‚Äô or ‚Äòbou‚Äô(mother), ‚Äòdai‚Äô or ‚Äòdaiti‚Äô (Uncle), ‚Äòmai‚Äô or ‚Äòmahiti‚Äô (Aunty), ‚Äòpei‚Äô or ‚Äòpahiti‚Äô (aunty), ‚ÄòKai‚Äô or ‚ÄòKaiti‚Äô (brother), ‚Äòbai‚Äô or ‚Äòbaiti‚Äô (sister), ‚Äòaowa‚Äô(Baby), ‚Äòpelinga‚Äô (adult boy), etc. Other nouns include ‚ÄòAti‚Äô (Village), ‚ÄòDati‚Äô (Border), ‚ÄòDanh‚Äô (Mosquito), ‚ÄòDar‚Äô (Cloth hanging rope), ‚ÄòDokora‚Äô (Wooden hammer), ‚ÄòDun‚Äô (Small Basket), ‚ÄòIngkori‚Äô (one inset), ‚ÄòJobaka‚Äô (Cleaner), ‚ÄòJobura‚Äô (Vegetable curry), ‚ÄòKuduna‚Äô (Grinding pot), ‚ÄòKuki‚Äô(Basket), ‚ÄòMadoli‚Äô(ornaments), ‚ÄòNawara‚Äô (Water protector), ‚ÄòPupu‚Äô (breast), ‚ÄòRoina‚Äô(Cleaning instrument), ‚ÄòTakun‚Äô(Stick), ‚ÄòTadung‚Äô (cooking spun), etc. Adjective, verb and adverbial terms of original language include ‚Äòamoto‚Äô (heart), ‚Äòayoi‚Äô (painful), ‚Äòayoiya‚Äô (very pain), ‚Äòbega‚Äô (quick), ‚Äòbugi‚Äô or ‚Äòbuki‚Äô (carrying), ‚Äòchuruka‚Äô (clean), ‚Äòdep-depia‚Äô (Full of pot), ‚Äòdow‚Äô (friend), ‚Äòdogiya‚Äô (beat), ‚Äòdakara‚Äô(not ready to eat), ‚Äòdobong‚Äô(Sound of falling), ‚Äòduba‚Äô (bury), ‚Äòdhupa‚Äô or ‚Äògoba‚Äô (covered by hand), ‚Äògujak‚Äô(thorn), ‚Äògugung‚Äô (long sharp weapon), ‚Äòhedem‚Äô (selfish), ‚Äòhaku‚Äô (Bamboo bridge), ‚Äòhao‚Äô (curse), ‚Äòhereka‚Äô (tasteless), ‚Äòheleng-jeleng‚Äô, (weakness), ‚Äòheleng‚Äô (weak), ‚Äòhiseba‚Äô(clearing water), ‚Äòkujung‚Äô or ‚Äòkunga‚Äô (bronken waist), ‚Äòkora‚Äô (bring out from pot), ‚Äòlabi‚Äô(take), ‚Äòlekia‚Äô (this type), ‚Äòlung‚Äô (very high), ‚Äòlikota‚Äô (hard to cut), ‚Äòpachiba‚Äô (ask to do), ‚Äòraideng‚Äô (big cane), ‚Äòrip-rip‚Äô (sweet wind), ‚Äòrim-jim‚Äô (mid test of chili), ‚Äòrohila‚Äô (stopping), ‚Äòruka‚Äô (putting hand in hole), ‚Äòsew‚Äô (habit), ‚Äòsew-bew‚Äô (character), ‚Äòteou‚Äô (though), etc. Religion In the early medieval period, the Chutias followed Folk religion similar to other Tibeto-Burman groups before adopting Hinduism.Chutias followed a tribal tantric cult During the rule of the Chutia dynasty, they worshipped with the help of their tribal priests, Deuris. Their favourite form of worshipping this deity was that of Kesai Khaiti, a tribal Goddess. A mix of tribal religion and Hinduism became the state religion at a very early time and influence was felt in the royal court. Human sacrifices of criminals was offered to tutelary Goddess, Khesai Khati and pilgrims from region far more remote i.e. Tibet and China brought their offerings as a token of faith. Chutia Dharma Husori performed in Borgaon, Tinsukia In modern times, the majority of Chutias are followers of Ekasarana Dharma, a pantheistic religion founded and propagated by Srimanta Sankardeva during the 15th century in Assam. Society =Social life= Chutia people generally live in joint families, although nowadays nuclear families have also started emerging. The number of members in a joint family at times exceeded one hundred. The father is the head of the family. It is only when the family became too big and unmanageable, that married sons were allowed to have their independent establishments. Household duties are discharged by the family members with mutual understanding and co-operation, on a rotatory basis.Dutta, Sristidhar, \\"The Mataks and their kingdom\\",p.45. Several families united together and formed a village. Each village had a headman called Gaon-burha. His office us hereditary. He is elected by the elders of the village, taking into account his moral integrity and intellect. The elders of the village formed a body or council called Raij-mel with the Gaonburga as its president. The council looked after any matter relating to the village. Questions of defence, crime and punishment are also under its jurisdiction. The Bar-maleki is the chief justice of a crime or punishment. For religious purposes at the village, there are other positions like the Hatula(for conducting rituals), the Bharali(care-taker of namghars and temples) and the Deori(distributing prasad and food). In a Chutia village, labour-intensive works fishing, hunting, sowing and harvesting crops, building huts or even marriages and death rites are usually done in a collective manner. The youth are also involved in a major way in society and usually serve as social workers. They are organised as Yuva Samaj or Yuvak Sangha. In certain villages, Aleng Ghar is constructed, where the young people gather together for doing social works. These houses are also popularly known as Dekachang(youth-house). =Clans= Chutiyas are originally divided into different clans/bangshas which were based on descendants of a common ancestor. These Bangshas were divided into Khels which were professional classes like Now-Holiya, Jaapi-hojiya, Lahing, Bebejia, etc. Khels were further divided into Foids.Barua, S.L. Chutiya Jatir Buranji. 2004, p. 229. Some of the major clans/Bangshas among Chutiyas are 1)Buruk, 2)Bihiya, 3)Borahi, 4)Lofai, 5)Lahual, 6)Lajum 7)Fesuwal, 8)Lalung, 9) Uta, 10)Har, 11)Chawrok, 12)Bosha, 13)Khas, 14)Lekang, 15)Changsa, 16)Melleng, 17)Laopiya, 18)Kantok, 19)Doisung, 20)Diha. Some of the Khels are 1)Rupawal, 2)Lahing, 3)Deori, 4)Kari, 5)Sonowal, 6)Tiruwal, 7)Luholiya, 8)Barisuwa, 9)Kohar, 10)Kumar, 11)Gospuriya, 12)Pangiriyal, 13)Dahotiya, 14)Moliya, 15)Rupsokoliya, 16)Khanikar, 17) Naoholiya, 18)Khatowal, 19)Jaapihojiya, 20)Bebejia, 21)Hiloidhari, 22)Dhekial, 23)Baruwati, 24)Dolakasharia. =Historical divisions= After the fall of the Chutia kingdom, the Chutia people were divided into different groups due to circumstances based on either religious inclinations or associations with other communities. Over time, Chutias divided into five important groups: * Hindu Chutia The Hindu Chutias represented a large section of the population. These are the Chutias who were initiated by Vaishnavite saints like Shankardev, Madhavdev into Vaishnavism sect of Hinduism. They are popularly termed as Kesa-ponthi as they have been imposed certain restrictions like the use of animal meat and alcohols in their rites by the Vaishnavite community. The other group Poka-ponthi have retained their tribal customs in their original form.Khanikar, Surjya kanta, Chutiya Jaatir Itihax aru Luko- Sanskriti.1991, p. 215. * Ahom Chutia Among the Pokaponthis, the Ahom Chutias formed the major sub-division. They were termed as such as they intermarried with the Ahoms. Most of them have been absorbed into the Ahom fold over time. In the British census, the Ahom Chutias along with many Kacharis and Morans returned as \\"Ahoms\\".(p.122.) They held various position in the Ahom kingdom's administration as seen with Momai Tamuli Borbarua, Langi Panisiya Borphukan,Goswami, Hemchandra, Purani Asam Buranji,p.31.Barua, Gopal Chandra, Ahom Buranji,p.37. Rupchandra Borbarua,Barua, Gopal Chandra, Ahom Buranji,p.32. Kirtichandra Borbarua, Lachit Borphukan, Piyoli Borphukan, Badanchandra Borphukan, Thumlung Borgohain,Chao-Thumlung Borgohain of a Tiura(Tai word for Chutia) family. Banrukia Gohain(during Susenpha's reign),\\"The Banrukia Hazarika was of Chutia origin. The Banrukia Gohain, a son of Banrukia Hazarika had seven sons.\\" Banlungia Gohain(during Rudra Singha's reign)Barua, Gopal Chandra, Ahom Buranji,p.31 and many more. Even during Sukapha's reign, many Chutia families like Som-chiringGoswami, Hemchandra, Purani Asam Buranji,p.23 and ChangsaiGoswami, Hemchandra, Purani Asam Buranji,p.25 were absorbed into the Ahom fold. Majority of Ahoms of the Chetia clan as well as the Lahon clan originated from the Chutia community.Dutta, Shristidhar, \\"The Mataks and their Kingdom\\",p.30 * Borahi Chutia It is believed that the Borahi Chutias were a sub-group of Chutias who had certain religious rites different from other Chutias. The Buranjis mention classes (khel) like the NaoboichaBorborua, Hiteswar,Ahomar Din and HiloidariNaoboicha Phukanar Buranji as being originally Chutias and included in the Borahi fold. Moreover, the Tai word used for the Borahis was Kha-lang meaning \\"slaves that lived below the Chang(platform)\\" (the way pigs are reared in rural Assam) indicating that the term \\"Borahi\\" was a derogatory term originally used to refer to the subjugated Chutias during the early years of Ahom rule. Although most of them were absorbed into the Ahom group, some of the Chutias living in Dhemaji, Golaghat and Sibsagar districts still identify themselves as Borahi- Chutias. * Deori Chutia Deori Chutias were originally the priests of the Chutia people. They were retained in Sadiya by the Ahoms after the Ahom-Chutia wars. Thus, they separated from the others and later took the identity of a different tribe.Sharma, S.K. Discovery of Northeast India: Volume 2. Mittal Publications,2005, p. 81. In the British census reports, the Deoris were termed as Deori-Chutias.Census of India: Part 1, p. 127., p.30. The community has maintained their racial traits, language, religion, folktales and traditional beliefs through the centuries.Sharma, S.K. Discovery of Northeast India: Volume 2. Mittal Publications,2005, p. 81. They were divided into Jimochayan/Dibang-Diyongial(Dibongia), Midoyan/Tengapania, Luitugan/Borgoya.Deoram, L.D.,Study of Mishing and Deori Community,p. 50. The native language is retained only by the Dibongia group. *Miri Chutia Miri Chutias were the Chutias who lived in the bordering villages of the northern bank of Brahmaputra and fled to the Miri hills during the Ahom invasions. They intermarried with the Mishing and were subsequently absorbed by the later. They chiefly belonged to the Bihiya, Buruk (Medok) and Bebejia clans.Miri Chutiyas explained in \\"Society and Economy in North-East India\\" In several villages, Mishing families still offer annual homage of ‚ÄòJal-Pinda‚Äô to some Chutiya Mine or Chutiya grandmother which indicates that these people were originally Chutias.Mising: An indigenous tribe of Assam In the past, these descendants of the Chutia aristocracy also wore their hair long, contrary to the usual custom of the Mishing tribe; this they said was the privilege of the royal family.Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 1880,p.236. One of the two groups among the Mishing tribe, the Barogram, were referred to as Chutia-Miri which indicates that these Mishings were earlier subjects of the Chutia kings. These people include clans like Pegu (derived from Pagro), Doley (derived from Doloi), Patir (derived from Pator) indicating the Chutia influence.Bhandari,J.S.,Ethnohistory, Ethnic Identity and Contemporary Mishing Society,p.94Taid, D.R.Transitional Phase of Acculturation of the Mishings vis-a-vis the Assamese society during Medieval Period of Assam,p.36. There is a large area in Dhemaji district inhabited by Barogram Mishings termed as Chutia-mirigaon. Traditional Attire =Male Attire= A Chutia man in his traditional attire The traditional attire of the Chutia men includes the Chutia paguri (headgear), Chutia sula (shirt), Churia (lower garment), Gamusa/Bisuwan (scarf), Cheleng sador (Shawl) and Tongali (waist scarf). The royals and the rich in the past wore clothes made out of Muga and Paat Silk, whereas the ordinary class wore Cotton (summers) and Eri Silk (winter). The royals also used other clothing items like the Panikamoli cloth as well as the Aruwan.The Chutia king Nitipal had gifted Panikamoli and Arowan to the Ahom kingBorborua, Hiteswar,Ahomar Din,p.49.The Ahom king received Aruwan cloth after looting Sadiya.Borborua, Hiteswar,Ahomar Din,p.563., The Aruwan-dhara khel was created for the first time during Suhungmung's rule after defeating Chutias. In the ancient times, royal men wore jewelry items like Longkeru (Earrings), Mota Moni (necklace) as well as golden footwear (Paduka). The royals also used silk umbrellas with gold embroidery known as Gunakara.Khanikar, Surjyakanta, Chutia Jatir Itihas Aru Loka-sanskriti,p. 383-384 Some components of the male attire include: *Chutia paguri Chutia priest Deori with the Xatphul paguri. There were several types of Chutia headgears or paguris in the past as per the style of tying the knots. The three primary types are Xatphul/Sarpa Paag, Ronuwa/Junga Paag and the Enajori Paag. Out of this, the Xatphul and Enajori paguri are still worn. The Xatphul type is worn by the priests/Deoris and is snake-shaped; hence the name Sarpa (snake). Today, the Chutias use this type as their traditional Chutia headgear. The Ronuwa type was worn in the battle field and can be seen in the terracota plates of Bhismaknagar as well as the Tamreswari temple.Barua, Swarnalata, Chutia jatir Buranji, p.696 The word Enajori means strong family bond.Meaning of Enajori The Enajori type was a commoners turban which is the one worn in Bihu dances today. *Churia (Churu-Isa) Terracotta plate of Bhismaknagar depicting a Chutia soldier wearing Churia. The Chutias often wear their Churia (dhoti) short (till the knees). The Deori-Chutia word for cloth is I√±/IsaDeori, Kishore,Chuperemago,p.17, I√± means clothDeori, Kishore,Chuperemago,p.17, Isa means a piece of clothIng-Isa collectively means cloth in Deori-Chutia(similar to the Dimasa RiDimasa word for cloth is Ri(p.11) and Boro HiBodo word for cloth is Hi). The word Churia is possibly derived from Churu-isa in Deori-Chutia meaning short (Churu) cloth (Isa).Deori,Sujata,Migration and cultural transformation of deoris in Assam; a geographical analysis: Socio-Cultural traits of Deoris, p.110The Dimasa word for dhoti is Risa(p.2) The Churias used by Chutia men are very well depicted in the terracota plates of Bhismaknaagar as well as the Tamreswari temple.Barua, Swarnalata, Chutia jatir Buranji, p.696 As per Buranjis, the Ahom royals didn't allow any common man to wear dhotis till their ankles which may be the reason why Chutias donot wear it that way.Bhuyan,S.K.Satsari Buranji, p.7 *Gamusa and Bisuwan The Gamusa is an important part of the Chutia attire and is used as a scarf. The Bisuwan (Bisu meaning \\"Bihu\\" and Wan meaning \\"textile\\")Van/Wan means textile is a variant of the Gamusa used during the Bihu/Bisu festival. The difference between the Gamusa and the Bisuwan is mainly the design and use. Although both the scarfs consist of red side borders, the Bisuwan consists of floral patterns as cross border at one end, instead of the regular plain red cross borders of the Gamusa. Gamusa is a regular scarf for daily use by the household. On the other hand, the Bihuwan is a special gift presented during the Bihu festival. On such occasion, respect for elders, affection for the young, love between young men and women blossom into ceremonial expression. That expression takes the form of a presentation of the bihuwan with special floral patterns. *Tangali Terracotta plate of Bhismaknagar showing Chutia attire Churia and Tongali. The Tangali is a waist wrapper worn by males or used as belt to gird the waist. In the past, a white Tangali was worn by warriors in the battlefield which would turn red with blood on their return. This symbolism later made way for the red Tangali which is worn by young boys when they perform Bihu Huchori. The two ends of Tangali are trimmed with fringes and ornamented with floral motifs of coloured threads. The Tangali can be seen in the terracota plates of Bhismaknagar as well as the Tamreswari temple.Barua, Swarnalata, Chutia jatir Buranji, p.696 *Cheleng Chador (Cheleng-Isa) The Cheleng Chador is another important component of the Chutia attire. It is usually wrapped around the shoulders similar to a shawl and is about 9 feet in length.Hamilton, Francis, Account of Assam,p.61, The Cheleng is a piece for wrapping around the shoulders of men in cold weather: it is 6 cubits long(9 feet) by 3 wide. The word Cheleng-chandor is possible derived from the word Deori-Chutia word Cheleng-Isa meaning long chest wrapper.As per the dictionary Chuperemago by Kishore Deori, Che=chest, Leng=long & Isa=cloth(chador)Kalita, Sonaram,Socio-Economic and political life of deoris in Assam: A study on social acculturation, p.173, The Deori community clothes are generally very colourful. They weave their own cloths like Igu (cloth used for lower portion of women), Seleng (scarf for men), baiga (women cloth used for upper portion of body), Bonse (towel), Topen (bed sheet) and various colourful dresses for both men and women in their looms. The Deori Bishu songs have mentions of Cheleng cloth in many instances such as: '''' =Women Attire= A Chutia girl in her traditional attire Riha(Methoni), Mekhela, Chula, Gatigi and ornaments Gam kharu, Madoli and Junbiri. Among the Chutia people, women of every age group have their own unique clothing style. Girls until puberty wear a Gamusa called Baiga as an upper garment and a Mekhela/Igu as a lower garment (waist to ankle). In the olden times, it was either made of Muga/Paat (effluent class) or cotton (common class).Padmeswar Naoboicha Phukan, Assam Buranji, p.30, As mentioned in the text, one of the Ahom kings adopted Muga and Paat in their royal courts by recruiting about 1000 Muga weavers from the Chutia community which shows the importance of Muga among Chutias After puberty and until marriage, the girls wear a Riha/Risa (chest wrapper)Nigam, V.N.,Learning geography instead of Baiga as the upper garment. This custom of changing the clothing style after puberty is a tradition of the tribe.There is still a custom in some rural areas that upon attaining puberty, the Riha is introduced to the menstruating girl. During marriages, the brides wear a Paat/Muga Riha along with Mekhela and Chador. The Dukothia, Chador and the Kokal-mora are signs of marriage.Unmarried women wore the Riha and the Mekhela. Only married women would wrap a Chador over their Rihas while going out. The brides also wore Harudai Jaapi as headgear in the past.Khanikar, Surjyakanta, Chutia Jatir Itihas Aru Loka-sanskriti,p. 384-389 A married women usually wears a mekhela, kokal-bandha (waist wrapper) as well as Gathigi (headgear) and a Chador to cover their head. The Mekhela of married women is a longer cloth which is worn up to their bosom unlike that of girls worn from the waist and downwards. The Riha of women is worn only on special occasions like Bihu, marriage ceremonies, temple visits, rituals, etc. Chutia traditional ornaments include Madoli (Chutia word), Dugdugi (Chutia word), Junbiri,‚Äå Thuria, and Gam- kharu.Khadu is a word of Bodo-kachari origin It is interesting to note that the girls of the community seldom wore earrings and the Thuria earrings symbolised the marital status of a woman. For marriage, the ears of the bride were pierced and the diameter of the holes was increased so that the Thuria earrings would fit into it. Some components of the female attire include: *Mekhela (Igu) The Mekhela is the most important component of the Chutia female attire. Until marriage, girls wear the mekhela from the waist downwards, which is later tied up to the bosom after marriage. The Deori- Chutia word for Mekhela is IguDeori,Sujata,Migration and cultural transformation of Deoris in Assam; a geographical analysis: Socio-Cultural traits of Deoris, p.110 (similar to Rigu of DimasasDimasa:Dress and Ornaments,p.32 and Rigwnai of Tripuri). Another cloth called Kokal-bondha (waist wrapper) is also worn above the mekhela by married women. The Chutias consider the red-embroidered Dabua-Bosa Mekhela to be their symbolic attire. Apart from the primary Dabua-bosa design, the Mekhela also consists of Buta- bosa and Phul-bosa at the lower end, which generally uses white and black threads. *Riha (Risa) Chutia girls wearing Riha, Mekhela and Gathigi. Riha refers to the chest wrapper worn by Chutia women. It is derived from the Deori-Chutia word IsaLuguri Isa is the chest wrapper for DeorisDeori,Sujata,Migration and cultural transformation of Deoris in Assam; a geographical analysis: Socio-Cultural traits of Deoris, p.110 (Risa in DimasaRisa in Dimasa means small(sa) cloth(ri). Although Risa is now referred to as the Dimasa dhoti, it may have referred to the women's upper garment(shorter) as well. Dimasa women today instead consider the longer Rijhamphai(chest to knee) as their upper garment. and TripuriBala, Lipika,Evolution of Risa with special reference to Tripuri tribes in TripuraBareh, Hamlet,Encyclopaedia of North-East India:Tripura, p.145The word for Cloth is Ri and for the chest-wrapper is Risa) The Riha is a narrow cloth as indicated by its name. It can be divided into two types. One worn by girls and the other by married women. Unmarried girls wear the Riha from the chest to the waist, while married women wear it by wrapping around the shoulder similar to the Chador. After the introduction of the blouse, the Riha has become pointless as a component of a girl's attire and is being replaced by the Chador-Blouse ensemble. But, among married women, it is still being although in a different fashion (like a Chador).The Riha, which is now worn as a sador, was initially a breast cloth. This discontinued use of the Riha/Risa among girls have made people believe that the Riha is only an attire of married women which isn't true. The style of wearing a Riha beneath the Chador among married women indicates that the Riha is much older. The Muga Riha/Risa forms a part of the symbolic attire of the Chutia people. Muga silk is an ancient heritage of the Chutia people. As per the Naoboicha Phukan Buranji, Muga was adopted in the Ahom courts at a later period by employing a thousand Muga producers and weavers from the Chutia community. It consists of patterns known as Kesh-bosa in both the ends. This is evident from the Chutia Bihu song, \\"Loskosi loskosi, Riha lobi Kesh basi\\". There are several types of folds involved in wearing a Chutia Riha (as a chest wrapper by girls). These include Japoni, Lahi-bhaj, Kakhori-bhaj, Khamusia-bhaj, Baiga and Kuwum. *Gathigi Gathigi is the headgear of Chutia women which consists of a Gamusa tied around the hair. The word Gathigi is derived from Gathi which means \\"knot\\" in Assamese language. It is mostly worn to protect the hair from dirt and also acts as a hair-covering while cooking. It is mostly worn to protect the hair from dirt and also acts as a hair-covering while cooking. The Bihu songs well establish the historical link between the traditional red-white Gamusa with Sadiya. '''' *Dukothia, Chador and Kokalmora An old Chutia woman wearing the Mekhela, Kokal-mora and Dukothia. The Chutia Dukothia is a cloth of 2 kathi or 6 feet in length and wrapped around the head and the upper body, while the Chador is about 8‚Äì9 feet in length and wrapped from the waist to the upper body and head. Wearing the Dukothia or Chador is compulsory for married women in front of elders or on religious occasions. These are mostly made of cotton or endi silk. The Kokal-mara, on the other hand, is a waist wrapper cloth. It is known as Joka-Chiba in the Deori-Chutia language and is worn above the mekhela and tied to the waist. The Dukothia, Chador along with the Kokal-mora symbolises the marital status of a woman. In spite of this, some girls wear the Dukothia as a scarf too. *Hasoti and Dabua Katari Chutia Dabua Katari which is tied to the Hasoti. The Hasoti and Dabua Katari are both age-old heritage of the Chutia tribe and form an important component of the Chutia female attire. Hasoti is a small red handkerchief which is tied to the Mekhela. On the other end of the Hasoti, a pocket clasp knife called Dabua Katari is tied. It is used by Chutia women to do daily chores like cutting areca nuts or betel nut leaves. The Dab/Dabua Katari is also found among Boros and Dimasas which they call as Daba knife. The Dab Katari finds mention in Deori Bishu songs as: '''' '''' *Harudai Jaapi The Jaapi has always been an integral part of Chutia heritage. The Chutia brides wore a Sorudoi Jaapi during marriage ceremonies which were continued up until recently.Khanikar, S. Chutia Jaatir Itihax Aru Luko-Sanskriti,1991, p.387. As per historical text, the last Chutia king Nitipal had given two gold and silver embroidered Japis to the Ahom king as gifts in his attempts for a treaty.Khanikar,S. Chutia Jaatir Itihax Aru Luko-Sanskriti,1991, p.100.\\"Then the Chuti√¢ king desired to send one silver lipped umbrella (J√¢pi), silver and gold bracelets, a gold pir√¢, an elephant, and two √Çroans to the Ahom king.\\" Besides this, after annexing Sadiya, the Ahom king received much treasure and bounty among which included Jaapis.Mahanta,S. Assam Buranji.D.H.A.S.,1945, p.10. During the Ahom rule, Jaapi-hajiya Khel (guild for making Jaapis) was monopolised by Chutias, which indicate that they were experts in weaving Japis.http://ignca.gov.in/Asi_data/72269.pdf Dutta, S. Mataks and their Kingdom, 1985, p.30 There is mention of Jaapi in Deori Bishu songs as: '''' Culture =Housing= The Chutia people reside mostly in the interior places of Upper Assam mostly on the banks of the rivers. The community is one of the reserved types and prefer living in isolation. The habitation pattern is based mainly on river routes. The villages are connected by a road which runs parallel to the river. A Chutia village usually consists from at least 60 to about 140 families. Earlier each family housed about 100 individuals in joint families,Dutta, Sristidhar,The Mataks and their kingdom,p.45.Morans, Borahis, Kacharis and Chutias were the main tribes in the Matak community. As all of them were Bodos in origin, they had a common living pattern too. They lived in joint families. The number of members in a joint family sometimes exceeded one hundred but over time nuclear families have also started replacing joint families. The Chutias are used to two kinds of dwelling - one is the grounded house and the other is the raised house(also known as Chang ghar). The materials used to build houses are mostly perishable ones like bamboo, wood, reeds and thatching grass. In the past, the Chutia royals lived in brick houses as evident from the ruins of Sadiya and other places. In every house, one can find a Bor ghar(consisting of a hall, fireplace and Akhal/kitchen) and a Maral ghar(bedroom). The Maral ghar is built at the centre of the house. There are other houses like Bharal ghar(granary),Goral ghar(poultry house) and a Guhali ghar (cowshed) in every family. There is a saying among the Chutias,\\"Pube Bharal, Pachhime Goral, Uttare Saru and Dakhine Goru\\". This indicates that the Bharal ghar was located in the eastern direction, the Goral ghar in the west, while the Bor ghar(Soru) and Guhali ghar in the north and south directions respectively. There is a long poduli (route) that connects the house to the village road and ultimately to the river-side road. The building of a house is known as ghar-saja. People in Chutia villages build their houses in a collectively. Whenever someone wants to build a house, he invites the villagers in an appointed day to help him. This get-together is termed as Haria luwa. Hari luwa also takes place in other social events which require large manpower like marriages, fishing or even during rice cultivation. After the house is completed, the household treats the villagers with rice beer, jalpan(snacks), etc. =Rituals= The rituals of the Chutia community have a tribal-tantric folk religion base with an influence of Hinduism. The spread of neo-Vaishnavite religion brought some reforms among a section of Chutias like who are now known as Kesa-ponthi. They are named as such because they have been imposed certain restrictions like use of animal meat and alcohol in their rites. Others who have retained the age- old customs in its original form are termed as Poka-ponthis. Some of the rituals include Sabahs like Holita loguwa, Aai, Panitula Borsabah, Dangoria, Borsarakia, Lakhimi/Minuchi Adora, Gorokhia, Khuti, Jal Devota, Jal kuwari, Apeswari, Kalika; Hewa/Pujas like Deo-kuber, Suvasani, Moh jokh Raati Hewa, Haun puja, and other rituals like Bhekulir Biya, Na-khuwa, Nangol dhua, Bhoral pitha dia, Nangol pitha dia.Barua, Swarnalata, Chutua jatir Buranji, p.360-400 A few of the rituals are discussed below. Deo-kuber  The Deo-kuber of the Chutia community The Deo-kuber ritual is a tribal-tantrik form of ancestral worship. It is also known as as earthen lamps are lighted in the name of the god of wealth Kuber as well as Kundi. The other Bodo origin tribes like Boros, Koch and Rabhas also celebrate a similar festival which they call as Kuber Brai. During the rule of the Chutia kings, this ritual was often organised for the welfare of the state. In this ceremony, the religious symbols of Kuber god, i.e. Golden cat and Golden sword-shield are placed at a pedestal and worshipped. During this ceremony, rice beer(Chuje), Handoh guri(ground rice), puffed rice (Akhoi), areca nut, betel leaves, several kinds of Pitha (Khula dia, Tel Diya, etc), duck meat and posola(a dish made of banana stem) are prepared. A pair of a male and female duck is sacrificed in the name of Gira-Girasi (ancestral deities) and smoked meat is offered along with two servings of Chuje to the deities. After the Deori completes his prayers and rituals, the duck is prepared into a dish and distributed among the people as offerings from God.Barua, Swarnalata, Chutua jatir Buranji, p.364-65 Dangoria Sabah The Dangoria is considered to be a village deity among the Chutias. According to the ancient beliefs, his spirit lives under the largest tree of the village and is supposed to protect the villagers from all troubles. Children are not allowed to go near the tree after the sunsets. The villagers believe that the spirit of the Dangoria roams around the village at night holding his Dang (stick). His spirit warns the people who are likely to face trouble in the upcoming days by hitting the gate of the family with his stick. If the household hears the noise, they organise the Dangoria ritual. The ritual is known as \\"Rangason\\" in Deori-Chutia language. The Dangoria Sabah of the Chutia community The ritual is generally organised near the tree where the spirit is believed to reside. Nowadays, many people organise it in their homes instead. The ritual is performed in several ways. The Poka-panthi sect offers rice wine (Chuje) along with meat while the Kesa- panthi sect offers rice-powder (pitha-guri), milk-pudding () and bananas. The Poka-panthis have three types of Dangoria rituals (Kala Sorai, Ronga sorai and Tinitia Sorai) according to the type of bird being sacrificed. The ritual is mostly performed during the evening time. In this ritual, first earthen lamps are lit under the tree. Then, an offering of or is made along with four pairs of betel leaf and areca nuts, Banana Khar and vegetable curry. The Poka- panthis also sacrifice the birds and cook the meat along with Korai guri. Later, the priests pray to the spirit of the Dangoria deity and bless the household. After that,‚Äå the food is eaten and the ritual ends.Barua, Swarnalata, Chutua jatir Buranji, p.367-68 Apeswari Sabah The Apeshwari Sabha is organised to worship Apeshwari Ai (a form of Kechai-khati goddess). Whenever a child in a household grows weak or an infant can't speak his first words, it is believed that the goddess has cursed the family. Therefore, in order to ask forgiveness for their sins, the family conducts the ritual. This ritual is also found among the Deoris and call the deity as Apeswari or Yoi Midi. The Apeswari Sabah of the Chutia community In this ritual, the house is first clean thoroughly and all the used clothes are washed. Then, some girls, as well as old women from the village, are called to the household. They are named as Gopinis and are made to sit in a circle in the courtyard. After that, the family brings in the offerings which include rice-powder (pitha-guri), unpasteurised milk (ewa gakhir) and bananas. Then, at the front of the women, a sieve (Saloni/Dala) is placed on top of which the offerings are arranged on a banana leaf (agoli kolpat) and a white cloth. Next, earthen lamps (saki) are lit and the area is decorated with flowers and betel nuts. The Gopinis then recite prayers (Apeshwari naam) to the goddess so as to bless the household especially the child. The family is asked to come and pray to the goddess and the Gopinis themselves bless the child/infant. After this is over, a set of offering is separated for the goddess and offered to her at the backyard of the house or in an open field. The rest is given to the Gopinis as offerings for their service.[ https://archive.org/details/chutiaburanji/page/n104/mode/1up Barua, Swarnalata, Chutua jatir Buranji, p.370-372] Suvasani  The Suvasani ritual is mostly carried out at night in the months of April/May for the well- being of family/village members. Suvasani Ai is a household deity (a form of the goddess Kechai-khati). During ancient times, the front room of the house was kept for the worship of this household deity. The members of the family generally treated the room as a protected room. In the ritual, first, the Deori (priest) prays to the goddess Suvasani for the welfare of the family/village and then distributes prasad along with holy water to the people for purifying their souls. Then, ducks are sacrificed by the priest with the help of other people. After the sacrifice is over, the male members of the family/village get together and organise a feast. This ritual is also found among the Tengaponia clan of the Deoris and call the deity as Suvasani or Yanyo Midi. Due to the influence of Neo-Vaishnava faith, a large number of Chutias have either left performing the ritual or have replaced the duck with an ash gourd.

ECMA-407 uses inverse coding in the time domain, an invention by the Swiss-Austrian mathematician Clemens Par, and shows lowest spatial bitrates ever achieved (for instance, several minutes of NHK 22.2 may be represented by an encapsulated data package of 100 bytes). It was chosen for the World Intellectual Property Organization Award in 2009. Inverse coding goes back to Victor Ambartsumian's scientific legacy on inverse problems and represents the first solution of its kind in audio by separating sound sources at the same frequency by a time-level model. Victor Ambartsumian formulated the first known inverse problem for monochromatic and isotropic elementary scattering acts in 1929. The first inverse problem in audio was solved by Clemens Par in 2002.  The Ecma S5 standards family  S5 (\\"Scalable Sparse Spatial Sound System\\") is a scalable multichannel coding system, which may incorporate a wide range of base audio codecs, preferably with additional encapsulation capacity for external data, e.g. MPEG-4 or MPEG-D. Compatible bit stream syntax may thus be maintained, and ECMA-407 becomes ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù during transmission. An S5 codec can be determined by the functional block diagrams of the S5 encoder and of the S5 decoder. According to the standard, S5 encoder shall at least consist of a base S5 encoder; and a S5 decoder shall at least consist of a base S5 decoder. S5 encoder. S5 decoder.  Base S5 System  The base S5 encoder compresses multichannel audio information by downmixing the f-channel signal to g channels and produces sparse spatial data according to an inverse coding model, which approaches the localization and ambiance of the original signal. The inverse coding model directly constructs an upmix of h channels from the audio downmix and its associated spatial data. Compressing the downmix audio by a base audio coder further increases the coding efficiency of S5. The various bitstreams produced by the functional units of an S5 encoder may be encapsulated into a single bitstream by the functional unit 'Multiplexer'. Ancillary data may be conveyed from the S5 encoder to the S5 decoder. This ancillary data may be used to encapsulate data other than coding parameters, for example, loudness parameters according to ITU-R or the European Broadcasting Union, which may be used to adjust the perceived level of audio signals. ECMA-407 specifies the base S5 encoder/decoder and their interfaces only. All other components and their interfaces are not specified, as such specific S5 codecs are subject to separate standards. As the base S5 encoder and the base S5 decoder are agnostic to the other system components, EMCA-407 represents the common base for all S5 specific standards.  S5 Conformance  ECMA-407 specifies the base S5 encoder and decoder in terms of configuration data, downmix, inverse coding parameter data and upmix. In addition it provides reference and guidance on how to incorporate further components to form a scalable multichannel coding system for audio data compression. S5 conformance is established by its specified dataflows.  S5 Signal Analysis and Invariant Theory  The discovery of algebraic invariants with Gaussian processes is based on David Hilbert's ‚Äû√úber die vollen Invariantensysteme‚Äú and the studies of Grace and Young from 1903. Algebraic invariants with Gaussian processes were discovered by Clemens Par in 2010 in conjunction with the depicted vertical plane. S5 'Signal Analysis' is not specified. It may be either based on statistical methods, which require extensive computational power, or on the discovery of algebraic invariants with Gaussian processes by Clemens Par in 2010 (after having been averted to this classical problem by Rudolf E. K√°lm√°n), based on German mathematician David Hilbert's published proof of the invariant field in 1893 and the apolarity behavior of algebraic cones as extensively studied by Grace and Young in 1903. Computational complexity can be easily eliminated, when basing S5 signal analysis on algebraic invariants.  S5 Extensions  Inverse coding in time domain finds its pendant with inverse coding in frequency domain, another invention of Clemens Par in 2013 and 2014, which unlike parametric coding requires no side information at all. This upmix in the Fourier field may double the number of output channels without altering the bitstream syntax.  S5 Loudness and Electronic Fingerprint  ECMA-407 uses modern tools such as loudness according to ITU-R or the European Broadcasting Union and electronic fingerprint that allow internal and external synchronization, for example, with video, with additional services or with \\"second screens\\".  First ECMA-407 Implementation and Broadcasts  ECMA-407 was first implemented by Swissaudec in 2014 in co- operation with Marco Mattavelli's research group at √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne and was tuned by Swissaudec and Wieslaw Woszczyk‚Äôs research group at McGill University‚Äôs ‚ÄúStudio 22‚Äù. Ecma S5 was first presented to the public by the Convenor of Ecma TC32-TG22 at International Multimedia Telecommunications Consortium in Porto, Portugal on October 8, 2013. Its world premiere was an ECMA-407 satellite test carrier, which was established in cooperation with France T√©l√©visions, SES, Ecma International and other partners for the \\"Future Zone\\" of IBC in Amsterdam in September 2014.

During the second half of the sixth century, Bagaran along with the entire canton of Arsharunik became the property of the Kamsarakan princes. The Church of Saint Theodore built between 624 and 631, was one of the main landmarks of Bagaran. Inscriptions on the church of Saint Theodore of Bagaran were located at the exterior of the entire building, starting at the northern face of the western apse and running across the northern, eastern and southern faces.

In 895, after the establishment of the Kingdom of Armenia, Bagaran became the capital of an independent Armenia under king Ashot I. His successor king Smbat I moved the capital Bagaran to Shirakavan in 890. Under the Bagratid rule, Bagaran remained one of the prosperous centers of the Armenian kingdom. Many members of the Bagratuni rulers, including Ashot I, were buried in Bagaran.Manuk-Khaloyan, Armen, \\"In the Cemetery of their Ancestors: The Royal Burial Tombs of the Bagratuni Kings of Greater Armenia (890-1073/79),\\" Revue des √âtudes Arm√©niennes 35 (2013): pp. 134-42. However, in 1045, Bagaran along with the Armenian capital Ani was invaded by the Byzantines. In 1064, the city was attacked and heavily destroyed by the Seljuk Turks. During the 12th century, the Shah-Armens took over Bagaran. In 1211, Bagaran was briefly ruled by the Zakarid princes of Armenia before being invaded by the Mongols in 1236. In 1394, Bagaran was finally destroyed by Tamerlane.Bagaran, one of the 13 capitals of Armenia =Modern= At the beginning of the twentieth century, there was an Armenian-populated village near the site of ancient Bagaran with a population of slightly over 300. In 1920, as a result of the Turkish‚ÄìArmenian War, the territories of the Republic of Armenia located west of Akhurian River were captured by Turkey. The small group of the Armenian survivors of Bagaran, crossed the river to the eastern bank and founded the modern village of Bagaran within the Armenian SSR, just 8 km south of the site of the ancient city. Nowadays, a small Kurdish-populated village called Kƒ±lƒ±tta≈üƒ± partially lies on the ruins of Bagaran, on the Turkish side of the closed border. According to the Armenian historian Joseph Orbeli, the Church of Saint Theodore of Bagaran was one of the most prominent examples of early medieval Armenian architecture.

SAFFA was organized by the Bund Schweizerischer Frauenvereine (BFS, the Federation of Swiss Women's Associations), the Swiss Catholic Women's League (SKF), and 28 other Swiss women's associations, to highlight the precarious situation of working women in the postwar years.  Saffa 1928  Lux Guyer's SAFFAhaus, as of today in K√ºsnacht The predecessor of Saffa was the first exhibition on women's work, organized by Rosa Neuenschwander in Bern in 1923. In the '\\"Viererfeld\\" area (today L√§nggasse- Felsenau) in Bern, the first Saffa was held from 26 August until 30 September 1928. Louise (Lux) Guyer, the first Swiss women architect, was the chief organizator, and she completed the buildings in only three months using prefabricated elements made of wood. When the fair opened, her reputation was firmly established. Focus of the exhibition were the services of women in family, working life, science and art; the representation of women's work and their importance for the Swiss economy and society. Saffa also promoted the female self-confidence and campaigned ‚Äìfor the so far not related ‚Äì political rights to the Swiss women and the right to a gainful employment, as well as for their recognition as Swiss citizens with all political rights, unless the Women's suffrage in Switzerland was realized in the last cantons in 1990.  Saffa 1958  Saffa-Insel on Z√ºrichsee lakeshore in Wollishofen From 17 July until 15 September 1958, the BSF led the second Saffa with over a hundred national and cantonal women's organisations on the Landiwiese in Z√ºrich- Wollishofen. Before, the Saffa-Insel, an artificial island was poured, being still a popular meeting place that is also used as lido in the summer and for events. As chief architect of the exhibition, which stood under the motto \\"Life circle of women in family, occupation, and country\\", acted Annemarie Hubacher-Constam. SAFFA presented the women, who were wanted in the booming economy as consumers and workers, possibilities in the areas of education, employment, shopping and leisure. In accordance with the needs of economic and sociopolitical needs, SAFFA promoted the then three-phase model as an 'ideal female curriculum': employment prior to the marriage, motherhood, and return to the labour market. In addition, the women had to absorb negative impacts of the rapidly changing world, nevertheless, by spreading harmony inside and outside of their families. The men should be made aware of 'women services' in the service of the general public on the indispensability and so motivated to fix the social discrimination against women. With the profits from the two exhibitions, solidarity works were established for women. Having 1.9 million visitors, the exhibition was organized exclusively and also designed by women, including ETH Zurich alumnae Berta Rahm and Claire Rufer-Eckmann.Jakob, Evelyne Lang. \\"The Life and Work of Berta Rahm, 1910 - 1998,\\" IAWA Newsletter, Fall 1999, V. 11, p. 1. An innovation and particularly startling were the rotundas, which were planned as manifestation of the solidarity of women. Topics such as \\"my home ‚Äì my world\\", \\"needle and thread\\" and \\"in the realm of the kitchen\\" attracted the then housewives. The Saffa 1958 was marked by the upcoming vote to women's suffrage, thus the promoters did not practice an overly combative appearance and even created a \\"men paradise\\" (M√§nnerparadies) department. On occasion of the Saffatheater J√∂rg Schneider played in the cabaret comedy Lysistrata. For that time, the women excelled with innovative ideas, among the Saffa Women's Orchestra at the opening concert, of course, exclusively from women musicians, and directed by the first women conductor who graduated in Switzerland, Hedi Salquin, who conducted the concerto for orchestra Intrada by Fernande Peyrot (1888‚Äì1978) in the Wasserkirche auditorium. The exhibition was a great success and generated a substantial financial surplus that was used for solidarity associations for women. The Saffa island was dedicated to women, and is part of the water lot owned by the canton of Z√ºrich.  Saffa 2020  The Swiss Federal Council signed the optional protocol as an addition to the Women Convention for the legal and formal recognition of the full human rights of women in Switzerland in February 2007. The Internet platform frauennet.ch proposed the decision to organise a third SAFFA on the occasion of their women picnic brunches on the Swiss national holiday on the Saffa-Island in Z√ºrich. For financial reasons, the project could not be started for the time being. Alliance F, as before better known as Bund Schweizerischer Frauenvereine (BFS), prepares a third Saffa, founded the \\"2020\\" association for this purpose, and initiated the project \\"2020 ‚Äì der weibliche blick auf die zukunft\\" (literally: 2020 ‚Äì the female looks to the future). The project seeks to capture ideas and visions for the future of our society from the perspective of women and in an appropriate manner of the public present. A first web presentation was 2013 and started the realization phase to SAFFA 2020.

Early life Dali Tambo is the son of Oliver Tambo, former president of the African National Congress, and Adelaide Tambo. Tambo attended Lancing College in West Sussex, United Kingdom, before going on to study at the American University and the Sorbonne in Paris, France, where he acquired a Bachelor's degree in International Affairs and Political Science. Dali Tambo is married to Rachael Tambo and they have four children; their oldest son is named after his father (OR Tambo). Artists Against Apartheid In 1983 Dali Tambo founded the anti-apartheid organisation Artists Against Apartheid with musician Jerry Dammers. The organisation organised numerous anti-apartheid concerts in Europe during the 1980s. Tambo returned to South Africa in 1991 as apartheid ended. People of the South Tambo hosted the talk show People of the South on SABC from 1994 to 2002 and again from 2012 to 2013. =Mugabe interview= On 2 June 2013 People of the South aired an interview Tambo did with the President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe only two months before the 2013 Zimbabwean general election. It reportedly took Tambo three years to organise the interview with the Mugabe family. The interview generated some controversy and was criticised for being \\"sycophantic\\" by the Mail & Guardian newspaper, and called a \\"public relations exercise\\" for Mugabe by CapeTalk567 radio presenter Kieno Kammies. In the heated interview with Kammies on CapeTalk567 Tambo replied that \\"People of the South [is] not Hard Talk\\" and that the show's laid back non-confrontational style would be at odds with challenging Mugabe on the allegations of human rights abuses, election fraud, and the controversial land reform program that Mugabe led. Sculpture park Since leaving People of the South in 2013, Tambo has focused his attention on promoting the idea of a commemorative sculpture park in city of Tshwane. The planned park will feature 400 to 500 life-size bronze statues of highly regarded anti-apartheid activists. Statues Through his company Koketso Growth, he obtained tenders to make statues. One such an example is The Statue of Nelson Mandela on the balcony of Cape Town City Hall. He commissioned Barry Jacksen and Xhanti Mpakama to do the work. It was unveiled on 24 July 2018.

Its origin is France. The Raf tomato Marmande is a variety which stands out for its flavor and texture, as well as its resistance to water with high salt content. The name Raf derives from the fact that it is resistant to a fungus called Fusarium oxysporum lycopersici (in Spanish, \\"resistente al Fusarium\\"). This was one of the causes of its popularization in greenhouse cultivation. Raf is the product of a selection of traditional tomatoes so it is not a hybrid tomato. Raf Tomatoes of Cabo de Gata-Nijar Natural Park In Spain the production areas most relevant to this type of tomato are the neighborhood of Cabo de Gata and the municipality of Nijar, both in Almeria (Spain)- Cabo de Gata-Nijar Natural Park.  Features  Their morphology is special and very characteristic. It is a fruit of irregular shape with deep furrows that end in the center, oval and flattened at the ends. These grooves make it very recognizable and attest to its quality. Its color is deep green with touches approaching the black on top. Inside the pulp is a pinkish color, compact very firm and juicy, meaty texture with small seeds. It is consistent and usually has a delicious sweet taste (9 degrees brix) due to the balance between sugar and acidity of citrus and malic type. Maturation occurs from the inside out. The Raf tomato is a vigorous plant but current productions try to reduce this original vigor he has done that encompasses within un-determinate transportation and medium vigor. Its natural size can reach 4 m while production will rarely let the feet. The reason that the Raf tomato is peculiar given for their growing conditions. Need a certain salinity water to counteract generating the fruit sugars. It has been cultivated for decades but semi-abandonment by more intensive crops. Originally it was cultivated in the open but now is under street or under plastic mesh. The production is usually limited to about 2,000 acres and yield of a plant usually 4‚Äì6 kg. The yield of a tomato plant of another variety ranges from 20 to 22 kg of product medium.

Career Born in Lisbon, Abreu began at Carcavelos at age 14, playing two seasons for their under‚Äì17 team before, moving for Estoril. He made his professional debut for them on 22 May 1994, in a Primeira Liga match against Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es, and added two more appearances in the remainder of the season. At 21-years, Abreu left Estoril and joined Atl√©tico CP on the third tier, a move he would follow in the following two seasons, first signing with Machico and then with Portimonense. On 13 August 1999, Abreu joined Benfica B. He was call-up by Jupp Heynckes for the first team match against Sporting on 6 May 2000, but did not play. In October 2000, he alongside, Diogo Lu√≠s and Geraldo Alves extended their contract with Benfica until 2004. In December, Abreu was loaned out to Felgueiras until the end of the season. He played his first game for Felgueiras in a home loss to Porto, and he was directly involved in injuries to two Porto players, Pena and Drulovic. The first required 15 stitches to his right hand and the latter lost two teeth and was knocked-out. He received criticism from Porto president, Pinto da Costa, to which he defended himself, describing the events: \\"The clash with Pena, was in my opinion, casual and without intent. I think everybody saw it. I am not the blame he got injured, it could happen to me. About Drulovic, I honestly do not remember anything and besides, it is irrelevant because it is thing that happen all the time in football.\\" Abreu returned to Benfica in June, but found himself back to the B-team and with an offer to terminate his contract and become a free player. In December, after six-months without competing, he accepted an early termination and signed with Oliveirense. He then began a career in the lower leagues, mainly the second and third tier, representing nine other clubs, before returning to Carcavelos in July 2015, for his final year.

At the end of January in 1990 he became Chairman (leader) of the short lived German Forum Party (DFP / Deutsche Forumpartei) in East Germany where in 1990 he sat as a member of the country's first (and last) freely elected People's Chamber (Volkskammer). Following the abolition of East Germany as a separate state, he became a member of the German National Assembly (Bundestag) between 1990 and 1994, his DFP (party) having merged with the German FDP in August 1990. Life Schmieder was born during the early years of the German Democratic Republic in a small town roughly halfway between Leipzig and Dresden. His parents were in business. His secondary schooling was successfully concluded in 1971 with several years at a special maths & sciences school in Riesa and an apprenticeship as an electrician. =Professional career= After his military service, in 1973 he enrolled as a student at the Technological University in Karl-Marx-Stadt. (The town has subsequently reverted to its earlier name, Chemnitz.) In 1978 he graduated with a degree in Thermal Engineering. He then worked for a year as a Project Leader with the Leipzig-Grimma Chemical Plant Construction operation before returning to the Technological University where he was employed, in the first instance, as a Research Assistant, and then from 1983 till 1984 as a Development Engineer. In 1984 he received an engineering doctorate for work on \\"Vacuum Drying of Plastic Granules in a Rotating-drum Dryer in the presence of Inert Gas\\".\\"Vakuumtrocknung von Plastgranulat in einem Vakuum- Drehtrommeltrockner unter Anwesenheit von Inertgas\\" He then became a senior employee with the Karl-Marx-Stadt district council for whom he worked till 1987. After that, till 1990, he was employed as a deputy team leader and patent engineer at the Karl-Marx-Stadt Research Centre. In parallel, in 1989 he started a correspondence course to become a patent attorney. From 1995 he worked for some time as managing partner of a Start-up and Management consultancy. At the same time Dr. Schmeider has since March 2001 headed up the regional People's Solidarity (Volkssolidarit√§t) organisation in Saxony. =Political career= J√ºrgen Schmieder joined the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD / Liberal-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands) in 1982. The East German LDPD was one of five constituent Bloc parties controlled by the country's ruling SED (party) through a political structure called the National Front. Between 1986 and 1988 Schmieder was district deputy party chairman for Karl-Marx-Stadt (Chemnitz) north. Karl-Marx-Stadt was the birthplace of the New Forum movement, and Schmieder was one of a group of New Forum activists who in December 1989 / January 1990 co-founded the German Forum Party (DFP / Deutsche Forumpartei). In January 1990 Schmieder was elected party chairman. The DFP joined with other small liberal/centrist parties, forming the Association of Free Democrats (Bund Freier Demokraten) to contest the East German national election on 18 March 1990. Schmieder's name headed the Alliance's list for the Leipzig electoral district: he was elected a member of the country's first (and last) freely elected People's Chamber (Volkskammer), and was nominated as one of the assembly's six deputy presidents. In October 1990 Schmieder was not among the 144 deputies in the chamber who, as part of the German reunification process, became members of the Bundestag (National Assembly) of the reunited Germany. However, in the national election two months later his name was included on the FDP candidate list for the Saxony electoral district. The party's share of the vote in Saxony entitled it to five seats from its list for the district, and accordingly Schmieder, whose name was fifth on the party list for the electoral district, was able to take his seat in the Bundestag at the start of 1991. As a member of the Bundestag he served as a full-time member of the Home affairs committee, the Post and telecommunications committee and more briefly (from August till October 1992) of the Legal affairs committee. He was also an alternating member of the Finance committee. At the same time he became district party Chairman for the FDP in Chemnitz and a member of the party's regional executive for Saxony. He held on to both these regional appointments till 1995. On the national stage, he failed to be listed as an FDP candidate for the next Bundestag election, which took place on 16 October 1994. He nevertheless contested the election as a direct (i.e. not on a party list) candidate for the Chemnitz electoral district. As anticipated, he failed to get elected, receiving just 2.5% of the first preference votes.

Digital TV Europe. Accessed November 30, 2014 Germany's HD+ was slated to be a founding member but was not included at this time. HD+ announced that it had joined the Free TV Alliance on October 29, 2014. In March 2015, the Free TV Alliance issued its first suite of technical specifications, offering a common way for an operator‚Äôs mobile app to control the TV viewing experience on the TV screen, aimed at harmonising the technology across Europe and removing complexities for equipment manufacturers. FTA and FTV Free satellite TV services (i.e. not pay-TV) in Europe take the form of either free-to-air (FTA) or free-to- view (FTV) broadcasts. Free-to-air services are transmitted in the clear without encryption and can be received by anyone with a suitable receiving dish antenna and DVB-compliant receiver. These services can include proprietary data services such as an EPG that is only available to reception equipment made for, or authorised by, the FTA broadcaster. Free-to-view services are broadcast encrypted and can only be viewed with reception equipment that includes a suitable conditional-access module and viewing card, in the same way as a pay-TV satellite service. However, the FTV service viewing card is usually a means to restrict access to the service to a specific geographic area or to pay for the delivery of the platform as a whole and not to authorise viewing of individual channels or packages of channels, and may be made available for a regular fee, a one-off payment or even for free. HD+, in particular, has come in for criticism for describing itself as Free-to-view and joining the Free TV Alliance because of the service fee charged for its viewing cards.http://www.a516digital.com/2014/11/where-free- tv-will-cost-you.html However, that all the HD+ channels are also available free to Sky Deutschland HD subscribers underlines that the HD+ service fee is for the provision of the platform, as explained in 2009 by Ferdinand Kayser, then president and CEO of SES Astra, \\"The fact that a free TV channel, financed by advertising or public fees, is encrypted, does not mean that it becomes a pay-TV channel. Cable TV, for example, is also not pay-TV just because the access to the cable costs money. The same applies to public TV for which you have to pay a [licence] fee.

In time of peace, their role was to protect official residences and palaces and to provide security to important political figures. In time of war, their role was to protect the Imperial headquarters, to escort prisoners and occasionally to enforce the law and limit civil disorder in conquered cities. The unit was renamed Gendarmes des chasses du roi during the First Bourbon Restoration but was disbanded in 1815 during the Second Restoration.  Organisation A squadron of Gendarmes d'√©lite was raised in 1801 and integrated into the Consular Guard. In 1804, the unit comprised two cavalry squadrons and two companies of infantry which were now part of the Imperial Guard. At full strength they were 632 men, but the infantry companies were disbanded in 1806 and only 456 cavalrymen remained in the unit. The men should be at least tall in order to enter the unit. A platoon of the Gendarmes d'√©lite was in charge of the execution of the Duke of Enghien in 1804.Isidore Marie Brignole Gautier, \\"Conduite de Bonaparte relativement aux assassinats de Monseigneur le duc d'Enghien et du Marquis de Frott√©\\", Paris, 1823, p.32 The same year a detachment of the Gendarmes d'√©lite escorted Napoleon in the street of Paris for his coronation.Bernard Picart, \\"Histoire des religions et des moeurs de tous les peuples du monde, Volume 5\\", Paris, 1819, p.293 Campaigns Gendarme d'√©lite The Gendarmes d'√©lite were nicknamed \\"The Immortals\\" because, as a military police, they were less engaged in combat than other units and had less personnel killed in action. However, when committed into combat they fought bravely and earned several battle honours. =Peninsular War= About 105 Gendarmes d'√©lite took part in the repression of the revolt of Madrid in 1808. A detachment of 56 gendarmes were part of Lassalle's great charge against Spanish positions at Medina de Rioseco (1808). They fought also at the siege of Astorga and the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo (1810). =Invasion of Russia and Sixth Coalition= The Gendarmes d'√©lite fought at the battle of Borodino and covered the French retreat at the battle of Berezina (1812). Despite the losses endured during the Russian campaign, the gendarmes fought at the battle of Leipzig in 1813. In a notable episode, general Fournier-Sarlov√®ze was sent to the Mayence prison by Napoleon for his defeatist attitude, following defeat at Leipzig. En route to Mayence, his carriage was escorted by a detachment of Gendarmes and was attacked by a group of Russian Cossacks. A gendarme was killed, but the general grabbed the sword of the dead, took the reins of the carriage and with the help of the remaining gendarmes routed the Cossacks. He then returned to his seat and stated \\"Go on! To Mayence!\\".B√©atrice Capelle et Jean-Claude Demory, Mar√©chaux d'Empire, E/P/A, 2008, 288 p. (), ¬´ Fournier- Sarlov√®ze, le sabreur extravagant ¬ª. The gendarmes fought the Russians again at Montmirail and Vauchamps during the invasion of France (1814). =Hundred Days= The first Bourbon Restoration saw the replacement of their bearskin caps by crested helmets which was partially completed when the war of the Seventh coalition broke out. The unit last saw action at the battles of Ligny and Waterloo (1815), before being disbanded during the second Bourbon Restoration.  Uniform  The Gendarmes d'√©lite wore a blue coat with red lapels, cuffs and turnbacks. The collar and cuff flaps were blue piped red. They wore buff breeches, waistcoat and gloves. They had white aiguillettes and clover-shaped epaulettes. They wore a tall bearskin cap with a visor, topped by a red round cloth patch nicknamed cul-de-singe (\\"monkey bottom\\") with a white grenade embroidered on it. They rode black horses. Belting was buff with white edges. The trumpeter wore the same uniform but with reversed colours. They rode grey horses. In 1815, crested helmets with black manes (red for trumpeters) were introduced but not completed, so the Gendarmes d'√©lite fought their last campaign with mixed headgears.

It transformed the 6,000-strong African Union-led peacekeeping force known as MISCA into a UN peacekeeping mission and became operational on September 15, 2014. The UN deployed a transition team to set up MINUSCA and prepare for a seamless transition of authority from MISCA to MINUSCA. As of 2016, it has more than 10,000 troops on the ground. Its role is to: * support for the _Pres_ process; * facilitating humanitarian assistance; * promotion and protection of human rights; * support for justice and the rule of law; * disarmament; * demobilization; * reintegration; * repatriation processes. The current Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of MINUSCA is Mankeur Ndiaye of Senegal. The top country contributor for troops and police is Rwanda with 1,369 troops and 438 police officers sent to assist with MINUSCA, followed by Pakistan, sending 1,225 troops and Senegal sending 316 police officers. History MINUSCA deployment in 2014 The S√©l√©ka militia staged a rebellion in 2013 that led to the end Fran√ßois Boziz√©'s regime in the Central African Republic (CAR), due to economic and political. The S√©l√©ka's continued heinous crimes in Central African Republic led to worsening conditions in Central African Republic, which then evolved the conflict from government resistance into a religious conflict. Information was later found that the S√©l√©ka was a Muslim group committing human rights violations against their predominately Christian country. A Christian militia then formed, calling themselves the Anti-Balaka, to fight against the S√©l√©ka. The Central African Republic began to weaken as the conflict continued, with an incline in mortality and a decline in life expectancy, which attributed to increasing rates of preventable and treatable diseases. The conflict also resulted in 320,000 people fleeing to neighboring countries, including Chad and Democratic Republic of Congo, and as of 2017, left approximately 600,000 people internally displaced.  Present  In 2015, a battalion from the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), numbering 807 personnel, was deployed to the CAR as part of MINUSCA. The DRC also deployed 118 police. In August 2015, allegations surfaced that three DRC soldiers had raped three young women in the town of Bambari, northeast of the capital Bangui. Allegations of child sexual exploitation and abuse were also made.MINUSCA, \\"New Allegations of Sexual Abuse Emerge Against MINUSCA Peacekeepers,\\" press release, February 4, 2016, cited in In January 2016, it was announced that the battalion would be repatriated, as it had failed to meet UN \\"vetting and preparedness\\" requirements. In recent attacks taken place in CAR in April 2018, MINUSCA and government forces initiated an operation that would disarm a militia, that was predominately Muslim, in Bangui's peacekeeping 5 district, which is also where Christians were majority. MINUSCA is challenged to attain the mandate in protecting human rights and disarming and dismantling non state actors due to the lack of infrastructure resistance in using military force. As the mandate for MINUSCA has been extended and amended on November 15, 2019, to fit the needs to support the Central African Armed Forces (FACA), there will be difficulty considering the lack of infrastructure and resources. The update to the mandate also includes for MINUSCA to assist the electoral process for a peaceful transition for president and legislative body by providing good offices, security, operational, logistical, and technical support for the election. In the Peacekeeping Budget, MINUSCA receives 14% of the budget, with a total of $930,211,900 as of 2018‚Äì2019.

It is a rhizomatous perennial. It has the common name of prairie iris.Robert Wildermuth, David P. Powell It was published by Small in Addisonia (Colored Illustrations and Popular Descriptions of Plants. New York, NY) in 1925. It was later classified by various Iris authors (including R. C. Foster, 'Contributor to Gray Herberium'. 119: 3‚Äì82. 1937) as a variety of Iris hexagona, and called Iris hexagona var. savannarum. It was listed in 'Iridaceae of North America database' (version 2010) and 'The PLANTS Database' (in 1996 and 2000), as 'Iris hexagona var. savannarum' and in the 'Guide to the Vascular Plants of Central Florida'.Richard P. Wunderlin In 2002, Henderson re-classified both of Small's species Iris giganticaerulea (located in coastal Alabama to Louisiana) and Iris savannarum (located in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida) as distinct species. Iris hexagona then was left to populations in South Carolina and a few regions in northern Florida. This was agreed and expanded on by Daniel Ward in 2011 (from the University of Florida), who linked Iris kimballiae as a variant of Iris savannarum. It was later classified as a synonym of Iris savannarum. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=44. Iris savannarum and several other ornamental plants were evaluated for their potential use as accumulator plants for treating arsenic (As) contaminated soils. It was found that the iris dry weight increased with increasing solution concentrations but As did not accumulate in the plant tissue. As the iris can be harvested multiple times a year, it is a good choice for phytostabilisation. It is listed on The National Wetland Plant List (NWPL), which was updated in 2013. It is found in Atlantic Gulf Coastal Plains (AGCP) and Eastern Mountains and Piedmont (EMP). Specimens can be found at the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario Herbarium. Iris savannarum has been hybridized with Iris fulva to produce Iris √ó cacique. Description Iris savannarum is different to Iris hexagona in several features, including seed capsules (Iris hexagona capsules are hexagonal while Iris savannarum capsules are rounded), leaves (Iris hexagona has yellow-green leaves, while Iris savannarum has bright green leaves) and blooming times (Iris hexagona flowers one month later than Iris savannarum). It has a greenish coloured rhizome (2‚Äì2.5 cm diameter) with the fibre-like remains of the last season leaves, which branches with ease, forming large open clumps or colonies. The colonies are sometimes measured by the acre. The rhizome is poisonous to humans. It has 30‚Äì100 cm long stems, which have one branch. It has bright green grass-like leaves, rising from the base of the plant, (approx. 60‚Äì100 cm long by 0.8‚Äì2 cm wide). They usually die back after the plant has stopped flowering. The iris flowers between spring and summer. Generally between March to April. It has between 1‚Äì3 flowers per stem. Which come in ranges of blue, from violet-blue to blue to white. The white form was originally called Iris albispiritis, until it was re-classified as a synonym of Iris savannarum. The perianth tube is 1.2‚Äì1.5 cm long. It has blue or pale violet sepals, which are flecked with white and have deep blue veining (either side of the central ridge). They are about 7‚Äì8 cm long. The central ridge is yellow with a light green claw. It has a bright green ellipsoid seed capsule, which is about 6‚Äì10 cm long. They have 6 sharp, wing-like, equally spaced ridges, which converge to form a stout beak at apex of the capsule. Inside, are brown, circular or lozenge-like (8-12mm diameter) seeds. The seed capsules can be very heavy, for the flowers stems, which then bend down to the ground or water (depending on habitat). The seeds are then released from the capsule, if released near water they will float (due to a cork-like coating). They can also drift in the wind to create new colonies. They are pollinated by insects, bees most normally. The iris flower has a small flap that protects the stigma, this prevents self-pollination. When a bee lands on the flower to gather pollen, it brushes past the flap, heading towards the anther. The bee collects pollen from the anther and deposits pollen from other flowers. On its way out, it brushes the stigma flap, closing it again. Native range Iris savannarum is found in the southeastern U.S., specifically in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. It is the most southerly-occurring iris species in the United States. Its main region of distribution is in Florida, where it dominates other iris species, and occurs in many small to medium-sized colonies in many places in the state. Its range in Florida includes Sarasota County, and even as far south as Big Cypress Swamp in Monroe County. It prefers open freshwater swamps. It also likes rich loamy sandy soils and poor sandy loam soils, and is tolerant of both soils that are wet all year and soils that are dry all year.

Ho'o was born in 1910 in Oakland, California, and in his youth campaigned on behalf of trade unions. Having previously studied t'ai chi with Choy Hok Pang, Ho'o rediscovered the art in his 50s whilst on a health retreat in Mexico. After this, he began teaching as an assistant of Wen-Shang Huang, one of his early instructors. The two of them founded the National T'ai Chi Association, a loose affiliation of t'ai chi schools, in 1962. In 1967, Huang left to teach at a university in China, leaving Ho'o in sole charge of the Association. On his return to China, Huang sponsored a teaching visit to America by Dong Huling to provide instruction to his American students. In 1973, Ho'o founded the Aspen Academy of the Martial Arts, a centre for the study of martial arts located in Aspen, Colorado. He held the post of professor of Oriental History at the California Institute of the Arts, and was Chairman of the National T'ai Chi Ch'uan Association. Ho'o was a licensed acupuncturist, and a member of the Black Belt Magazine Hall of Fame. He developed his own form of t'ai chi, extracting movements from a number of different styles. His approach stressed the health benefits of t'ai chi, and focussed on exercises to relax and soften the body. Ho'o died in 1993, survived by his seven children.

Background and chart success Songwriter Bill Martin described \\"Shang-a-Lang\\" as an attempt to combine Brill Building songwriting - in particular the partly onomatopoeic lines of \\"Da Doo Ron Ron\\" - with the clanging sounds he'd long heard emanating from the shipyards in the Glasgow burgh of Govan where he'd been born and raised.

Martin's collaborator Phil Coulter created the track's clapping sound by hitting two pieces of wood together as he had in their 1970 writing success, \\"Back Home\\", by the England football team. \\"Shang-a-Lang\\" was Bay City Roller's fifth single release and their third to place in the UK charts, its tenure being ten weeks in the spring of 1974 with a peak of number 2 being held off from the number 1 position by another nostalgic track: \\"Sugar Baby Love\\" by The Rubettes. \\"Shang-a-Lang\\" would be the first Bay City Rollers single released in Canada where the group would soon become massively popular: however the original \\"Shang-a-Lang\\" was expediently covered by Montreal-based session group Tinker's Moon (de) whose version charted at #23 in Canada: the Tinker's Moon version also gave \\"Shang-a-Lang\\" what attention the song would receive in the US reaching number 111 on the Record World Singles Chart 101 - 150.Record World Vol 30 (1 August 1974) #1419 p. 30 References Category:1974 songs Category:1974 singles Category:Bell Records singles Category:Bay City Rollers songs Category:Songs written by Bill Martin (songwriter) Category:Songs written by Phil Coulter ","title":"Shang-a-Lang (song)"},{"id":"44562040","text":"They Always Return at Dawn (Spanish: Siempre vuelven de madrugada) is a 1949 Spanish drama film directed by Jer√≥nimo Mihura.Bentley p.96 Cast * Mercedes Albert as Elvira * Margarita Andrey as Susana * Manuel Arb√≥ as Comisario Su√°rez * Rafael Bardem as Don Carlos * Francisco Bernal as Barman * Rafael Cort√©s * F√©lix Fernandez as Don Jos√© * Jos√© Franco as El hombre * Casimiro Hurtado * Rufino Ingl√©s as Paco * Jos√© Isbert as Don Jacobo * Mar√≠a Mart√≠n as Mary * Arturo Mar√≠n as Don Ram√≥n * Matilde Mu√±oz Sampedro as Maruja * Miguel Pastor as Manolo * Julio Pe√±a as Luis * Antonia Planas as Do√±a Pilar * Conrado San Mart√≠n as Andr√©s * Asunci√≥n Sancho as Cecilia * Pilar Sirvent as Chica del tiro al blanco * Mar√≠a Luisa Sol√©  References  Bibliography * Bentley, Bernard.

However tandoori chicken as a dish originated in the Punjab before the independence of India and Pakistan.Rude Food: The Collected Food Writings of Vir Sanghv By Vir Sanghvi In the late 1940s, tandoori chicken was popularised at Moti Mahal in Peshawar by Kundan Lal Jaggi, Thakur Dass, and Kundan Lal Gujral, who are all Punjabi as well as the founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant. =Naan= According to the New Larousse Gastronomique (2018) culinary reference book, \\"the Punjabi naan is a white-flour, yeasted flat bread enriched with a little ghee ‚Äì its tear-shape comes from being slapped on the side of a tandoor oven and baked partly hanging vertically\\".New Larousse Gastronomique (2018).

History Frederick John Bright was born in Castle Hedingham, in Essex in 1832 and went onto work for the London Missionary Service in India. During his time in India, his son Percy was born by his wife June in 1864. They returned to England due to the ill health of Frederick's mother, firstly moving to Poole, then Lymington where Frederick ran a small haberdashery business for 6 years. In 1871 he opened a store at no. 9 Bournemouth Arcade selling needlework and Berlin Wool, before quickly adding a bookshop and a printers which by 1894 were located at 8-11 Bournemouth Arcade. From 1886 F J Brights printed the Brights Illustrated Guide to Bournemouth. The store expanded again by adding a new stationery and fancy goods department at 14-26 Old Christchurch Road, and moving into the new art of photography. The business continued to be run by Frederick until the 1920s when his son Percy took over. In 1923 he took over Flora Ltd, a Gown & Millinery shop in Southsea renaming the business Brights (Southsea) Ltd, however by 1928 the business was no longer operational. He sold off the photography and printing business in 1924 to partner Frank Higby Oliver. In 1925 he purchased the Exeter department store Colson & Co. rebranding the store Colsons of Exeter, and in 1932 bought the Clifton department store of Bobby & Co. In 1941, however, Percy was hit by a coal lorry and died at the age of 78. After the war the Exeter store was rebuilt in 1953 and the business continued to operate as an independent company until 1960 when J J Allen took over the Brights brand. The Brights brand continued to be operated after the purchase of J J Allen by House of Fraser in 1969, however after the purchase of Dingles by House of Fraser in 1971, the Brights and Colsons brands were dropped and replaced by Dingles in 1972.

Hagupit particularly impacted the Philippines in early December while gradually weakening, killing 18 people and causing $114 million (2014 USD) in the country. Prior to making landfall, Hagupit was considered the worst threat to the Philippines in 2014, but it was significantly smaller than 2013's Typhoon Haiyan. Hagupit developed into the 22nd tropical storm of the annual typhoon season on 1 December 2014 and became that year's eleventh typhoon the next day. Under a favorable environment, the typhoon underwent rapid deepening and reached peak intensity northwest of Palau on 4 December, with a clear eye. Hagupit slightly weakened but restrengthened on 5 December, but subsequently started to weaken again, due to subsidence associated with an upper-level trough. The typhoon made first landfall over the province of Eastern Samar in the Philippines on 6 December, and then made three other landfalls over the country. For land interaction and the slow movement, Hagupit weakened into a tropical storm on 8 December. When arriving at the South China Sea on 9 December, deep convection of the storm diminished significantly. The system could not overcome the hostile environment and weakened into a tropical depression on 11 December, before it eventually dissipated southeast of Ho Chi Minh City on 12 December. Meteorological history A tropical disturbance formed about 130 km (80 mi) north of the equator and about 530 km (330 mi) south-southwest of Kosrae in the afternoon of 29 November, resulting in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the next day for consolidating under favorable upper-level conditions. Early on 1 December, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded it to a tropical depression, and so did the JTWC designating it as 22W. Only six hours later, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Hagupit, as well as the JTWC, owing to a consolidating low-level circulation center (LLCC) with tightly curved banding wrapping into the system. However, the RSMC best track data indicated that the system had been already a tropical depression since 30 November and a tropical storm early on 1 December. With low vertical wind shear and excellent radial outflow, Hagupit consolidated further on 2 December and was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA and a typhoon by the JTWC at noon. Late on the same day, the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon when it began to track west- northwestward along the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge. A swath of GPM/GMI precipitation rates over Typhoon Hagupit Remaining in a favorable environment, Hagupit underwent rapid deepening in the afternoon on 3 December and as a result, the JTWC upgraded it to a super typhoon due to the system depicting a significant eye. The PAGASA named the typhoon Ruby as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility early on 4 December. Simultaneously, Hagupit presented the very tightly curved and deep convective banding with a clear 35 km (25 mi) eye, which 1-minute maximum sustained winds reached 285 km/h (180 mph), equivalent to Category 5 of the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). The JTWC also forecast that Hagupit would become as strong as Typhoon Haiyan, but it failed to intensify further. The JMA analyzed that Hagupit had reached peak intensity at 06:00 UTC, with the 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 215 km/h (130 mph) and the central pressure at 905 hPa (26.72 inHg). However, the system then started an eyewall replacement cycle and due to moderate easterly vertical wind shear, became less symmetric, with the bulk of the deep convection displaced over the western semi-circle. Typhoon Hagupit approaching the Philippines on 6 December As Hagupit slowed down and continued a weakening trend, the eye became cloud-filled early on 5 December, and as a result, was no longer equivalent to Category 5 of the SSHWS. Because of a robust poleward outflow channel into the mid-latitude westerlies to the north, the eye became clearer and was surrounded by a symmetric annulus of intense convection; the JMA also indicated the brief intensification at noon. Moreover, a slight break in the steering and the zonal flow along the southern periphery of the mid-latitude trough lacked the dynamics to influence Hagupit, making the typhoon move westward very slowly. Outflow in the southeast quadrant got hampered due to subsidence associated with an upper-level trough, resulting in a cloud-filled eye again. Thus, Hagupit weakened further, causing the JTWC to downgrade it to a typhoon early on 6 December. At 21:15 PST (13:15 UTC), Typhoon Hagupit made landfall over Dolores, Eastern Samar, with the 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). Half a day later, the system made its second landfall over Cataingan, Masbate and turned west-northwestward. Owing to land interaction and its slow movement, the JMA downgraded Hagupit to a severe tropical storm on 7 December, at 21:00 UTC. The JTWC also downgraded Hagupit to a tropical storm early on 8 December, right before the fragmented system made its third landfall over Torrijos, Marinduque. After its fourth landfall over San Juan, Batangas at 17:45 PST (09:45 UTC), the JMA downgraded Hagupit to a tropical storm at noon. On 9 December, deep convection over the LLCC weakened significantly when Hagupit arrived at the South China Sea and turned westward, although good poleward outflow channel tapping into the mid-latitude westerlies helped the system sustain its minimal tropical storm intensity. Soon after that, due to a marginally favorable environment, deep convection over the partially exposed LLCC increased again. Hagupit briefly intensified in the afternoon on 9 December, under moderate vertical wind shear offset by vigorous poleward outflow into the strong westerly flow to the north. However, deep convection began to be displaced from the partially exposed LLCC one day after. On 11 December, despite favorable poleward outflow, Hagupit was not able to overcome upper-level subsidence in the southeastern quadrant and increasing vertical wind shear, as low-level northeasterly winds became completely out of phase with the upper-level. Consequently, the JMA downgraded it to a tropical depression, and so did the JTWC. The JTWC issued its final warning on Hagupit due to the LLCC of Hagupit being displaced from the deep convection and rapidly unraveling early on 12 December. Hagupit eventually dissipated southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, before noon on 12 December. Preparations PSWS Map in the Philippines during the passage of Typhoon Hagupit (Ruby) Typhoon Hagupit, also known as Typhoon Ruby, entered the PAR late on 3 December, at the same time it was upgraded into a Category 5 super typhoon. With this, the NDRRMC reported that schools were suspended in the areas: Samar, Biliran and Tacloban during 4‚Äì5 December. On 5 December, the NDRRMC had put up Signal Warnings No. 1 and 2 from the lower part of Luzon to the upper part of Mindanao. Rough seas and gale-force winds were warned over the seaboards over the eastern part of the country. The Department of Health went under Code Red alert at DOH-retained hospitals in regions expected to be hit by the typhoon starting on 6 December. At the same time, PAGASA has put up Signal No. 3 warnings over Samar and were expecting storm surge up to 4 metres high. Residents in at least 42 areas in Bicol and Visayas took precautionary measures against possible storm surge due to Ruby. As of 7:30 a.m, Project NOAH said three of the 42 are under Storm Surge Advisory (SSA) 3, 11 are under SSA 2, and the rest are under SSA 1. SSA 3 involves waves of up to four meters above sea level; SSA 2 three meters; and SSA 1 two meters. It was also reported that schools and businesses were closed from 5‚Äì6 December in places in Visayas and southern Luzon. Because of its slow movement, preparations were further warned in areas such as southern Luzon and western Visayas. The PAGASA and NDRRMC warned that classes and businesses were suspended again during 8‚Äì9 December in Regions III, IV-A, IV-B and NCR. Early on 8 December, the PAGASA had issued a Signal No. 2 warning over Metro Manila and the MMDA has also been put on red alert because of the typhoon. On 8 December, the NDRRMC had reported that other regions such as Regions I, V, VII and CARAGA has no classes during 8‚Äì9 December. Impact As a weakening Category 3 typhoon, Hagupit first made landfall over Dolores, Eastern Samar on 6 December. Because of its slow movement, Signal Warning No. 3 were still up in some places in Visayas. The next day, Hagupit made its second landfall over Cataingan, Masbate. As of 19 December, at least 18 people had been confirmed dead by the typhoon, leaving nearly 916 injured according to the NDRRMC. Total financial loss were calculated at PhP5.09 billion (US$114 million).  Retirement  The name Ruby was the replacement for the name Reming, which was retired by PAGASA after its 2006 incarnation. Despite being used for the first time, PAGASA announced that the name Ruby would be retired from its naming lists after incurring over PhP1 billion in damages. The name Rosita has been selected by PAGASA to replace Ruby for the 2018 season, which was itself retired after the season.

The motor may have fixed or variable torque depending on the stator winding. It is named after its inventor Robert Dahlander (1870‚Äì1935). Invention Robert Dahlander Robert Dahlander, a Swedish engineer working for ASEA, discovered that switching the poles in a motor led to a reduction in the speed of the motor. In 1897 he invented an electrical configuration to switch between poles in a motor for which he was granted a patent along with his co-worker Karl Arvid Lindstr√∂m. The new connection was named the \\"Dahlander connection\\" and a motor having such a configuration is commonly referred to as a \\"pole changing motor\\" or a \\"Dahlander motor\\"., Arrangement for obtaining two different pole numbers for asynchronous AC motors, 11 February 1897 Operation delta connection) and high speed (double star connection) The Dahlander motor is based on a 'consequent pole' connection. The primary factor in determining the speed of an induction motor is the number of poles, given by the formula :n_s={120\\\\times{f}\\\\over{p}} (RPM), where :ns = Synchronous speed, in revolutions per minute :f = AC power frequency :p = Number of poles per phase winding A regular induction motor has an equal number of opposite poles; that is, at any instant, there are an equal number of North and South magnetic poles. Some smaller induction motors are connected so that all the poles are identical, causing the motor to act as though there is an equal number of opposite poles in between. A Dahlander motor achieves different speeds by switching the configuration of the electrical windings, indirectly adding or removing poles and thus varying the rotor speed. The poles can be varied at a ratio of 1:2 and thus the speed can be varied at 2:1. Normally, the electrical configuration of windings is varied from a delta connection (Œî) to a double star connection (YY) configuration in order to change the speed of the motor for constant torque applications, such as the hoists in cranes. Star connections (Y) varied to double star connections (YY) are used for quadratic torque applications, such as pumps. Advantages and disadvantages Dahlander motors have advantages compared to other speed control systems like variable frequency drives, as there is less power loss. This is because most of the power is used to drive the motor and no electrical pulse switching is done. The system is much simpler and easier to use compared to other speed control methods available. However, the Dahlander motor has the disadvantage of fast mechanical wear and tear due to changing speeds in such a drastic ratio; this type of connection also produces high harmonic distortion during the shifting of poles as the angular distance between the power generated increases as the poles are decreased in the motor. Application Pole changing motors are normally used in applications where two speed controls are necessary. Some typical applications are: *Pumps, wherein two speeds can be used to control the output flow *Fans, to get variable air flow output *Crushers *Milling applications *Cranes, where two speeds can be used in hoisting applications: one speed for material movement and the other for positioning the material held in the hoist See also * Induction motor * AC motor * Variable- frequency drive * Variable-speed air compressor * Vector control (motor) References Category:Motor control Category:Electric motors Category:Electric power systems components Category:Electric power conversion Category:Mechanical power transmission Category:Mechanical power control Category:Electrical power control Category:Swedish inventions ","title":"Dahlander pole changing motor"},{"id":"44562391","text":"Jean-Louis Moncet (born July 30, 1945, in Rabat, Morocco) is a French motorsports journalist.

History =1966-7= An LVT-5 hit by mortars at Firebase Gio Linh on the night of 9 May 1967 still burns the next morning The base was established 13 km north of ƒê√¥ng H√† on Highway 1 immediately south of the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). On 19 May 1966 the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) attacked the ARVN base at Gio Linh killing 43 and wounding 54. From 15‚Äì18 September 1966 the 1st Battalion, 26th Marines launched Operation Deckhouse IV and discovered that the PAVN had built a network of tunnels and bunkers in the Con Thien-Gio Linh area. Gio Linh was intended to form part of the McNamara Line and formed one corner of what became known as Leatherneck Square, with the other corners being Con Thien, Cam L·ªô Combat Base and ƒê√¥ng H√† Combat Base. In February 1967 the 12th Marines had 4 175mm guns and 6 105mm howitzers based at Gio Linh. On 27 February the PAVN attacked Gio Linh with mortars, rocket and artillery fire. On 20 March the base was subjected to another rocket and artillery attack and on 21 March a supply convoy was ambushed just 300m from the base. The PAVN claimed to have killed over 1,000 enemy troops and destroyed 17 artillery pieces, 57 vehicles and three helicopters in the 20 March artillery barrage. From 20 March to 1 April Operation Beacon Hill saw BLT 1st Battalion, 4th Marines patrolling around the base to try to prevent further PAVN attacks. From 10‚Äì17 April the 11th Engineer Battalion began clearing a 200m wide strip between Gio Linh and Con Thien, a distance of over 10 km the strip was eventually completed on 1 July and widened to 600m. On 27/8 April Gio Linh was hit by over 800 artillery shells and 200 mortar rounds. On 8 May the PAVN launched an attack on Con Thien and shelled Gio Linh in an attempt to reduce its fire support for Con Thien. On 17/18 May PAVN artillery rockets and artillery hit ƒê√¥ng H√† and Gio Linh, killing 1 Marine and wounding 12 others at Gio Linh. By July engineers had completed clearing a 500m radius around the base and had started building underground bunkers. On 2 July, the first day of Operation Buffalo the base was again heavily shelled in an attempt to reduce fire support for the encircled 1st Battalion, 9th Marines. =1968‚Äì9= From late 1967 the ARVN 2nd Regiment of the 1st Division was based at Gio Linh together with Company M 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines to provide security for the artillery. On 9 January a mortar attack on the base resulted in 3 Marines killed and 2 wounded. In September 1969 as part of Operation Keystone Cardinal the 3rd Marine Division began its withdrawal from Vietnam and by early October the Marines had handed over control of their tactical area of operations (including the Gio Linh base) to the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division and the ARVN 1st Division. =1970-2= In 1970 the M55 Self Propelled Howitzer of the Marines 5th 175mm Gun Battery remained at Gio Linh under the command of the Army's 108th Artillery Group. A small number of Marines remained at ƒê√¥ng H√† as part of the ANGLICO unit supporting the ARVN 1st Division. By January 1972 the ARVN 3rd Division had assumed responsibility for the area north of Highway 9. The PAVN launched their Easter Offensive on 30 March 1972 and by midday on 1 April the ARVN garrison at Gio Linh had retreated from their perimeter positions to the base's bunkers, while the 5-man ANGLICO team continued to call in fire missions against the advancing PAVN. PAVN forces were probing the base perimeter when an Army Bell UH-1 Iroquois arrived to evacuate the ANGLICO team, just as the team was boarding the helicopter the landing zone was hit by mortar fire mortally wounding the team leader. Corporal James Worth of the ANGLICO team failed to board the helicopter and was listed as Missing in Action. By nightfall on 1 April all ARVN defensive positions along the DMZ and north of the Cam Lo River had fallen to the PAVN. Gio Linh would remain in North Vietnamese hands for the rest of the war.

Plot Half-brothers Yasha (Yakov) and Merab Papashvili live in Tbilisi. Yasha is a musician, and Merab works as a taxi driver. In 1987, Yasha (being half- Jewish on his mother's side) decides to repatriate to Israel with his family. Merab, being quite happy with his own lifestyle of a careless playboy and not thinking of emigration, accompanies them to Moscow and then to the Sheremetyevo airport. The brothers want to drink champagne together one last time, but the local cafe would not serve any and sends them to the duty-free shop instead. Not quite realizing the possible consequences, easy-going Merab grabs his brother's travel document and crosses the border checkpoint, pretending to be him. He buys champagne in the duty-free, but then realizes that he can't walk back quite as easily. He runs frantically around the airport, and due to a series of misunderstandings ends up being escorted to board a plane (meant for Yasha) which immediately takes off. While onboard, Merab befriends the charming adventurer Borya, who is dressed as a stereotypical Russian peasant and sports a balalaika. The plane lands in Vienna (a common practice at the time, due to the lack of direct flights from Moscow to Tel Aviv). As soon as they leave the airport, Borya breaks his balalaika apart to reveal a large stash of US dollars hidden inside (which at the time was illegal to own in the Soviet Union, let alone earn). He proceeds to buy himself a stylish outfit in the nearest supermarket and casually offers Merab a job. When the latter refuses, Borya gives him a taxi ride to the Soviet embassy and leaves, cheerfully anticipating to continue his spending spree. Merab tries unsuccessfully to get help from the embassy, but is told that the ambassador is off till Monday, and even then his case can't be resolved quickly. When Merab tries to press the issue, he is promptly apprehended by the Austrian police, taken mugshot of, and handed over to Sokhnut. There he again meets Borya, who had already managed to lose all his money in a casino. Undaunted, he contemplates the new business opportunities. Both decide to let Sokhnut fly them to Israel. Once in Israel, Merab again pretends to be Yasha to get through the immigration procedures. His new plan is to borrow some money from the local relatives, then return to USSR on a tourist visa and switch places with the real Yasha. He is received by Uncle Izya (Isaac) and his wife. After hearing his improbable story, Izya thinks he is a KGB spy and throws him out of the house at gunpoint. After spending a night in an abandoned boat on the beach, Merab visits the local market and encounters a casual acquaintance from Tbilisi, a former policeman, who brings him to a lavish party attended by another acquaintance of both, wealthy and influential Tengiz. At first Tengiz seems sympathetic, but Izya, who happened to be among the guests too, denounces Merab as a KGB agent. Merab is beaten and thrown out. After spending another night on the beach, Merab tries to contact the Soviet mission, but they wouldn't believe his story and suspect him of being an agent provocateur of some kind. Enraged, Merab follows the official to the parking and handcuffs himself to his car (he borrowed a pair of handcuffs from another protester a little earlier). However, this turns out to be a wrong car, and the official departs. Having no keys to the handcuffs, Merab unhinges the car door and carries it around for a while, before being able to break free. Merab is approached by an American journalist Jane and confides his story to her. She introduces him to old Senya (Semyon), a World War II veteran who works in a huge industrial freezing facility and seems to be involved in some shady business. He proposes a plan to sneak Merab secretly through the borders back to the USSR, and they depart on a fridge truck. On the way, both drink and sing Russian songs. Senya grows increasingly paranoid and incapacitates several innocent bystanders who seem suspicious to him. The truck is stopped by the police, while Merab is driving. Senya pretends to be asleep and not knowing Merab at all. Merab tries to run, is shot in the leg, arrested, taken mugshot of (this becomes a sort of a running gag in the movie), and thrown in prison. There he quickly changes several cells, being beaten by both Muslims and Jews after his unsuccessful attempts to blend in. Soon thereafter, Merab is bailed out of prison by Tengiz, who was alerted by Senya and after checking with mutual acquaintances in Tbilisi realized that Merab is in fact not a spy. They drive through the desert, when Senya confronts them on his fridge truck and stubbornly insists on his original plan. When Tengiz protests, Senya incapacitates him, then also Merab, and forcibly brings the latter to the border. Resigned to his fate, Merab bluntly obeys. Suddenly turned somber and mournful, Senya gives Merab his wedding ring and asks to put it on his wife's grave back in the USSR. (A flash-forward sequence during the opening credits, unexplained until now, reveals that in due time Merab made good on this promise). Senya walks Merab through the minefield, gives him directions and contacts, walks back and blows up on a landmine in what was possibly a deliberate suicide. Devastated, Merab remains on the site until captured by Jordanian border patrol. He is apprehended, taken mugshot of, and imprisoned as an Israeli spy. Three years later Merab is released from the prison. Using Senya's contacts, he crosses to Turkey and travels to the border with USSR. His original travel document is probably lost or expired, and in any case not meant for reentry, so he has no legal way of entering. Left without other options, he wades across the border river, waist- deep, with arms outstretched, begging the unseen border guards not to shoot. The film ends with yet another mugshot.

The buildings were Grade II listed by Cadw in 1967.British Listed Buildings;accessed 01 December 2014 The Georgian house dates from 1803 when it was built by John Price as his family home. The listed buildings also include Cadnant Lodge, at the entrance to the estate; a range of domestic outbuildings (which are thought to pre-date the Georgian house) and an icehouse. History The land at Plas Cadnant began as a farm in the 16th century, and by the Victorian era had become a country estate. The estate deteriorated during the second half of the twentieth century until it was purchased in 1990 by Anthony Tavernor who began renovations on the buildings and grounds. While his intentions were to open the estate as a business, he describes the renovation work as \\"a labour of love\\". Tavernor aimed to restore the gardens in the picturesque ideal, aiming for an early 1800s style. By 2006 Tavernor had opened a hotel service on the grounds via a number of self-catering cottages. Previously only open by appointment, the gardens were opened to the public in 2011, and a tea room and visitor centre were built. Gardens The estate's gardens were developed in the 1800s by the family who owned the land but had been left to grow wild since the 1940s. In the 1990s renovations began to uncover and restore the overgrown areas, and in 2010 Anthony Tavernor was honoured by the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales for his work. The garden consists of three sections: a walled garden containing a water pool, a \\"secret valley\\" garden in which waterfalls and a river can be found, and an upper woodland garden. In December 2015, during heavy flooding, water damaged large parts of the garden including the destruction of an original 200-year- old wall and a number of rare plants. Repairs began on the affected areas of the garden in January 2016.

She was appointed to that position in 2006, the first woman to lead a public university in the African Great Lakes area. Background and education She was born and raised in Kenya. She attended the University of Nairobi, graduating with a Bachelor of Education degree. She studied at Iowa State University, obtaining the degree of Master of Science in family studies in 1983. Her degree of Doctor of Philosophy, in the same field, was obtained in 1988, also from Iowa State University. She also holds a Master of Business Administration from the Eastern and Southern African Management Institute. Career When she graduated with her first degree, she joined the staff at Kenyatta University, in 1981, as a tutorial fellow. Because she had done very well during her Bachelor of Education studies, obtaining a first class honours degree in the process, she was given a scholarship to study at Iowa State University for her masters and doctorate. After her graduate studies in the United States, she returned to lecture at Kenyatta University. She specialized in \\"women‚Äôs education, home economics, statistics and research methodology\\". She was promoted from Lecturer to Head of Department, to Dean of Faculty. Then she was appointed Deputy Vice Chancellor for Finance and Planning. In 2006, when the position of Vice Chancellor at the university was advertised, she applied and beat three other applicants, all male, for the job. As Vice Chancellor, one of the major accomplishments is the establishment of Kenyatta University Referral Hospital, a 500-bed referral hospital, wholly owned by the university, which cost US$95 million to construct. In October 2013, Professor Olive Mugenda was appointed Chairperson of the Council of the Association of Commonwealth Universities. The association is the oldest international universities network, with over 500 universities, in 37 countries as members. The secretariat is based in London, United Kingdom. After her retirement from Kenyatta university, President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated her to serve in the Judicial Service Commission where she is to represent members of the public.https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2018/02/mugenda-koskei-nominated-to- judicial-service-commission/ She was also appointed in April 2019 as the chairperson of the board of the Kenyatta University Teaching & Referral Hospital in 2019.https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Uhuru-picks-Mugenda-to-chair- KU-hospital-board/1056-5060390-14wv1hhz/index.html The board was tasked to kickstart operations in the hospital that had been lying idle years after completion due to uncertainties over its management and ownership structure. She is currently the chancellor of KCA university. Family Mugenda and her late husband, Abel Mugenda, an academic at the University of Nairobi, are the parents of four children.

Background Kadyrov's election was considered by many to be by a fraudulent vote. The attack occurred during a parade and concert celebrating the 59th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the Second World War. Attack The explosion was caused by a bomb planted underneath the concrete floor of the VIP podium and occurred at 10:35 am during a cultural presentation that followed the parade. The blast tore a hole in the section designated for dignitaries. Other fatalities of the attack included Khussein Isayev (Chairman of the State Council), and Adlan Khasanov (a reporter for Reuters).

The attack may have been intended to sow panic and disorder among the Chechen leadership. The Russian appointed Prime Minister Sergei Abramov served as President until new elections were held sometime before September, as stipulated by the republic's constitution.

As is typical of other members of its family, this species has the ability to jump out of the water and glide on hypertrophied fins in order to evade predators. It is considered a ‚Äútwo-winged‚Äù flying fish, meaning that it only has enlarged pectoral fins, as opposed to ‚Äúfour-winged‚Äù flying fish, which have both enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. Davenport J. 1994. How and why do flying fish fly? Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries 4(2): 184-214.  Description  The sailfin flying fish is stocky as far as flying fish are concerned. It has comparatively small pectoral fins and a long dorsal fin relative to other flying fish. One distinguishing feature is its blunt snout. It displays countershading.McEachren J, Fechhelm JD. 1998. Fishes of the Gulf of Mexico, Vol. 1: Myxiniformes to Gasterosteiformes. One average, P. brachypterus measure 110-130 mm in length. Females of the species are usually slightly longer and heavier than the males.Stevens PW, Bennett CK, and Berg JJ. 2003. Flyingfish spawning (Parexocoetus brachypterus) in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Environmental Biology of Fishes 61: 71-76.  Distribution and habitat  This species is dispersed globally in coastal and sub-coastal waters. It is found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.Chang S, Chang C, Ame E. 2012. ‚ÄúSpecies composition and distribution of the dominant flying fishes (Exocoetidae) associated with the Kuroshio Current, South China Sea‚Äù The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology 60(2): 539-550.Trilles J, Ravichandran S, Rameshkumar G. 2011. A checklist of the Cymothoidae (Crustacea, Isopoda) recorded from Indian fishes. Acta Parasitologica 56(4): 446-459. In the Western Atlantic Ocean, it can be found off the shores of northern Florida to Brazil, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.  Behavior  When spawning sailfin flying fish aggregate in large numbers, with groups estimated to contain up to one million members in some cases. The individuals in such aggregations display high-energy jumping, gliding and swimming. Groups contain an unequal sex ratio, with males being approximately three times more abundant than females. Small groups usually containing 3-4 fish have been observed during spawning events. Such groups are thought to consist of one female being pursued by several males; these observations are consistent with the sex rations observed in the group as a whole. There are two spawning periods during the year, one from September to January, and one from March to August. Unlike other species of flying fish, it is unsure whether or not fertilized eggs need to attach themselves to flotsam. There are reports that this species‚Äô eggs may be free-floating.  Ecology  Like most other flying fish, the sailfin flying fish feeds primarily on zooplankton. It has also been found to eat fish scales and Sargassum, and is thought to be a generalist.Casazza TL. 2008. Community Structure and Diets of Fishes Associated with Pelagic Sargassum and Open-water Habitats off North Carolina. University of North Carolina It plays an important ecological role as a prey species for larger predators. Some organisms known to predate on the sailfin flying fish are large fish, dolphinfish in particular, large squids, and seabirds.Fanning LP, Oxenford HA. 2011. Ecosystem issues pertaining to the flyingfish fisheries of the eastern Caribbean.Harrison CS, Hida TS, Seki MP. 1983. Hawaiian Seabird Feeding Ecology. Wildlife Monographs 85: 3-71. The sailfin flying fish is the only known host to the buccal attaching parasite Glossobius parexocoetii, an isopod in the family Cymothoidae.Martin MB, Bruce NL, and Nowak BF. 2015. Review of the buccal-attaching fish parasite genus Glossobius Schioedte & Meinert, 1883 (Crustacea: Isopoda: Cymothoidae). Zootaxa 3979(2): 337-350. P. brachypterus has also been seen hosting various other species of parasites. Importance to humans P. brachypterus is generally considered bycatch by the commercial fishing industry. However, like other flying fishes, they can be prepared as salted fish by salting them and leaving them to dry out in the sun. In Taiwan, the sailfin flying fish and other flying fish are eaten by locals and are also used as bait. Flying fish eggs are also exported to Japan. To the Tao people, an indigenous ethnic group in Taiwan, P. brachypterus is one of the species of flying fish that comprise the bulk of their traditional fishing stock. Important Tao festivals coincide with the arrival and departure and flying fish from local waters. Between 2006-2007, there was a 60% decrease in the numbers of flying fish taken from Taiwanese fisheries, leading to concern from the indigenous people about the long-term viability of the flying fish stock. As an important prey item of dolphinfish, the sailfin flying fish and other species of flying fish play an important ecological role in maintaining dolphinfish fisheries. Because of high populations in the eastern Caribbean, some scientists have suggested investigating the feasibility of commercial P. brachypterus fishing in the region.Oxenford HA, Mahon R, Hunte W. 1995.

It convened to discuss the Henotikon, a christological document issued by Byzantine emperor Zeno in an attempt to resolve theological disputes that had arisen from the Council of Chalcedon. The Council was convoked by the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church Babgen I Umtsetsi. Besides the Armenians, delegates from the Georgian and Albanian churches were present. According to the Book of Epistles, 20 bishops, 14 laymen, and many Nakharars (princes) attended the council. The Armenian Church had not accepted the conclusions of the Council of Chalcedon, which had defined that Christ is 'acknowledged in two natures', thus condemning monophysitism (though not Cyril of Alexandria's miaphysitism), which insisted on the unification of human and divine natures into Christ. Miaphysitism was the doctrine of the Armenian Church among others. The Henotikon, Emperor Zeno's attempt at conciliation, was published in 482. It reminded bishops of the condemnation of Nestorian doctrine, which emphasized the human nature of Christ, and did not mention the Chalcedonian dyophysite creed. The First Council of Dvin was thus able to accept the Henotikon and keep open a possibility of conciliation with the Patriarchate of Constantinople while remaining steady in its christological doctrine. The Council stopped short of formally rejecting the Chalcedonian Definition of the dual nature of Christ. Such a step, which formalized the Armenian break from the Roman church, would not take place until the Second Council of Dvin, in 554/555. According to Karekin Sarkissian, in the first council of Dvin there is \\"the first official and formal rejection of the Council of Chalcedon by the Armenian Church\\". The Acts of the Council were discovered by Karapet Ter Mkrtchian and published by him in 1901.

Life Tewdwr was a member of the royal family of Cornouaille in Armorica. His father was Hoel, who figured in Welsh mythology about the Matter of Britain and Tristan and Iseult. While Tewdwr was still young, his grandfather Budic II was overthrown and forced into exile at the court of Aergol Lawhir of Dyfed. Budic successfully restored himself in the 540s but Hoel seems to have predeceased him. The king attempted to protect his succession by negotiating with a neighbouring ruler, Macliau of the Veneti, so that whichever lived longer would protect the young heir of the other. Upon Budic's death, however, Macliau invaded and annexed Cornouaille ( -577). Tewdwr fled to Cornwall and ruled over Penwith from Carnsew near the mouth of the Hayle River. He became infamous for his hostile reaction to Irish missionaries. He opposed Breage's mission (although Sabine Baring-Gould placed its arrival around 500), first compelling them to land at Reyvier instead of CarnsewBaring-Gould, Sabine.

After decades of exile, Tewdwr returned to Brittany and defeated Macliau and his oldest son Jacob in 577. He permitted Macliau's younger son Waroc to rule around Vannes. Legacy Having made martyrs of the Irish missionaries he opposed, Tewdwr became so infamous for his oppression that he began to appear in the hagiographies of saints he could not possibly have known, such as the 4th-century Meriasek. The early 6th- century Saint Kea supposedly protected a deer Tewdwr was hunting; losing his oxen in retaliation, the saint simply yoked the wild animal to plow his fields. Koch suggests that Tewdwr's appearances in Cornish literature-- particularly the Tudor dramas Beunans Meriasek and Bewnans Ke--were satirical treatments of Henry VII of England following his suppression of the Cornish rebellion of 1497.Koch, John.

So jump and sing your little song!‚Äù She kissed the boy heartily, who jumped Sprightly down the little hill, Soon he sang his little song in the shady valley, Jubilant; ‚ÄúNow I have everything!‚Äú Up and down floated his song. His mother called: ‚ÄúBring up flowers, Do not forget the flowers, light blue and small, They will be down there along the creek!‚Äù The mother enjoyed the joyful floating Of the little angel among the flowers, She prayed thankfully, mindful That the boy was a gift from Heaven. The flowers kissed the boy's mouth, They nodded to him in a dainty round, He laid down exhausted among them, And whispered: ‚ÄúI will go to sweet sleep.‚Äù Hidden under the flowery cover, The boy fell soon sweet and silent asleep; The mother called, but always in vain, ‚ÄúWhere is my little child, Lord of my life?‚Äù She hurries, whining loudly, down to the valley, Called shuddering her darling hundred times, Cried heartbreakingly, in tormenting urge. There she saw ‚Äì a shimmering snake! It curled and rustled away through the grass, Barely breathing, the mother spied at the place, A cry of horror from her breast, And she sank down, unconscious. Like a wilted flower in the dawn, So lay her lovely darling dead! With a painful smile in his pale face, His little hand held firmly ‚Äì forget- me-not. }  Setting  The cantata in D major is scored for choir, soloists and piano.

This darkly humoristic neo-noir drama explores the themes of friendship, crime, loneliness and tragic death. It was launched in Norway in September 2013 and in the UK in August 2014. Critics both in Renberg's native Norway and abroad have hailed it as a career high and compared him with the likes of Balzac, George R.R. Martin and the writers of modern HBO-series. See You Tomorrow is the first novel in the Teksas-series. Plot summary See You Tomorrow is set in Stavanger, the author's hometown and surroundings which he uses for his literary exploration of the human condition. The novel is told through 11 narrators, characters belonging to highly different worlds within the same city ‚Äì a group of adolescents at a high school and the bewildered and desperate father of two of them, and a gang of petty criminals trying to cope with the changing times. All of them are in search of something, trying to fill the holes in their lives. P√•l, divorced father of two, has a shameful secret that has dragged him into a huge debt, a lot more than he can ever hope to pay with his modest civil servant salary. He is desperate to make sure that no one finds out ‚Äì especially not his teenage daughters or his ex-wife. Sixteen-year-old Sandra also has a secret. She is in love with the irresistible delinquent Daniel William, a love so strong and pure that nothing can come in its way. Cecilie carries the greatest secret of them all, a baby growing inside her. She can only hope that her boyfriend Rudi is the child's father. But although she loves him, she feels trapped in their small-time criminal existence and dreams of escaping from it all. Over three fateful September days, these lives cross in a whirlwind of brutality, laughter, tragedy and love that will change them forever. History In the autumn of 2013, a new chapter began in Tore Renberg‚Äôs career. Renberg was known for his five novels spanning the young life and adulthood of Jarle Klepp (The Man Who Loved Yngve, The Orheim Company, Charlotte Isabel Hansen / I Travel Alone, Pixley Mapogo, These Are My Old Days) - a literary character resembling, to a certain extent, the author himself. However, Renberg was eager to challenge himself and take his literature a step further, moving away from autobiography and wholly embracing fiction and imaginative storytelling. The result was the novel See You Tomorrow. It was an immediate success, receiving rave reviews from the Norwegian critics and reprinted twice that same autumn. The second novel in the Teksas-series, Attack From All Sides, followed a year after and was also very well received. See You Tomorrow has also been published in Denmark and Sweden and the rights have been sold to a total of eight countries. Narration and literary technique See You Tomorrow is told in the present tense, and chronologically. It spans over 6 days the autumn of 2012, and consists of four parts, the first called ‚ÄùTuesday 25 September‚Äù, the second ‚ÄùWednesday 26 September‚Äù, the third ‚ÄùThursday 27 September‚Äù, and the fourth ‚ÄùSunday 30 September‚Äù. Like many books by Renberg, it uses epigraphs, this time one for every part: A quotation from Nick Cave, Mot√∂rhead and the Proverbs. The most important narrative trait of the novel is its multivocality. Renberg has named William Faulkner¬¥s As I Lay Dying (1930) one of the key influences to the literary style and technique of See You Tomorrow. Faulkner's novel tells the story of a collective, namely the Bundren family and their associates, as they fulfil the late Addie Bundren's wish to be buried in the town of Jefferson. In this eponymous novel Faulkner uses multiple narrators, varying chapter lengths and modes. As I Lay Dying presents itself through 15 different points of view over 59 chapters, titled by their narrators¬¥names. The major difference between As I Lay Dying and See You Tomorrow in terms of narration and style, lies in the fact that Renberg does not use first person narration, monologue or strict stream of consciousness. See You Tomorrow is told through 11 narrators, in the third person, but using a very intimate narrative tone, to the extent that the reader almost feels like it is a first person in disguise. The chapters are named with titles, blending a feel of the classic 19th century novel of Dickens or Balzac, with the modern rock album and American grit/pulp. Tore Renberg has several times stated music as a significant influence for his work, and more than ever with See You Tomorrow (Significance of music in See You Tomorrow). Among the 11 voices in See You Tomorrow there is no clear protagonist, but it could be argued that the centre of the novel is the petty criminal gang-leader Jan Inge Haraldsen, who stands as a sort of baroque chief in this universe, both literary and in terms of content. The characters See You Tomorrow has a wide range of characters, ranging from baroque criminals, a prostitute, a public employee and a group of young adults. 11 of them are point of view- narrators in the novel. Cecilie Haraldsen (born 1972). Petty criminal woman about to turn forty, nicknamed ‚ÄúChessi‚Äù. She lives in a run-down house by the fjord just outside the town centre of Stavanger together with her brother and her boyfriend. She has ‚Äúhips like shelves‚Äù and is described as ‚Äúborn difficult‚Äù and ‚Äúdownright spiny‚Äù, ‚Äúpale and freckly‚Äù, and unexpectedly sexy. She loves cinnamon buns, power ballads, first and foremost by Aerosmith, and cigarettes. As the novel progresses, the reader learns that Cecilie is pregnant, but that she does not know who the father is: her boyfriend Rudi, or Tong, the inmate she's been visiting in prison. As a young teenager she was being presented to the friends of her brother's as a gift in return for their criminal favors, thus becoming an in-house prostitute. One of these early guests was her now boyfriend, Rudi. This story is to be found in the pre-See You Tomorrow short novel, The Video Boy (2006). Cecilie holds 11 chapters in See You Tomorrow. Rudi (born 1970). Cecilie's boyfriend, also a petty criminal. Rudi's real name is Rune Digervold. He is a major fan of classic heavy metal like AC/DC and Mot√∂rhead, he has ADD/ADHD and he considers speech golden and silence overrated. Rudi calls himself ‚Äúthe Baron of Love‚Äù and is devoted to Cecilie in a very persistent way. A comic and a tragic figure, a very Renbergian portrait of a masculine and limitless man, echoing other such figures in his authorship, for instance Helge Ombo in the Jarle Klepp-series. For the romantic couple Cecilie and Rudi, Renberg has stated that Lula and Sailor in Barry Gifford¬¥s Wild at Heart as a major influence, as well as David Lynch¬¥s 1990 adaptation of the same novel. Rudi holds 13 chaptes in See You Tomorrow. Jan Inge Haraldsen (born 1969). The leader and the hoodlum mastermind of the Hillev√•g-Gang and Cecilie's older brother. Jan Inge started his criminal career in his teens, lending his sister out ‚Äúlike a VHS‚Äù (Rudi) in return for favors. From this gritty background in the eighties he built his trash-Tony Soprano world of torpedo jobs and petty crime. Jan Inge has been fascinated by horror movies since he was young. He considers them great works of ethic, and holds them alongside the Bible in telling the truth. He has plans of one day writing a book called ‚ÄúIt¬¥s too late ‚Äì a study of horror movies‚Äù. Jan Inge, now 120 kilos and lonely, also reckons himself a modern-day leader, constantly reading books on leadership theory. Unlike the two other persons in the house, metal is not his favorite music, he prefers old school country & western like Tammy Wynette and Kitty Wells. He has a secret relationship with a prostitute, Beverley Hinna, whom he visits once a week. His greatest fear is being left by his sister Cecilie and best friend Rudi, like his dad left him when he was 12 to go to Houston and work in the oil business after Jan Inge and Cecilie's mom died. Jan Inge has set up a list of house and gang rules, one of them being that the Hillev√•g-gang is anti- violence. The rule has been broken several times, and as See You Tomorrow unravels, Jan Inge must face the fact that he himself has become a killer. Jan Inge holds 12 chapters in See You Tomorrow. P√•l (born 1972). A forty-year-old man, a public employee. P√•l is the single father of two teenage daughters. His economy is in bad shape, he has gotten himself a debt of well over one million Norwegian kroners, and in a pathetic attempt to solve his problems he makes contact with a guy he knew when he grew up and whom he has heard turned criminal: Rudi. He offers himself up to the Hillev√•g-gang, stating that he will do anything for them if they can get him the money. This is the center of the crime-plot of See You Tomorrow and the one action that kickstarts the novel. P√•l loves his daughters and his border collie, Zitha. Tore Renberg was inspired by the notorious Baasland-case whilst creating the P√•l-character (a major criminal case in Norway where Bjarte Baasland, the son of a Norwegian bishop, got into a 70 million Norwegian kroner debt after gambling on the Internet). P√•l holds 12 chapters in See You Tomorrow. Tiril (born 1998). Tiril is the youngest of P√•l's daughters. Tiril is an angry with everything. She dresses up in torn stockings, purple and black clothes, in the emo-style of the first decade of the 2000s. Tiril has an evening job at the local shop where she lives, at Madla, some kilometres outside of the town centre of Stavanger. Tiril writes LOVE/HATE on her knuckles, and says that one day she will travel to Little Rock, Arkansas ‚Äì the hometown of Amy Lee, the singer of her favorite band, Evanescence. Tiril holds 10 chapters in See You Tomorrow. Malene (born 1997). Renberg has stated Malene as his personal favorite. She is perhaps the most mature human being portrayed in his novel, even though she is only fifteen. Malene is a much calmer character than her raging sister. She is a highly talented gymnast. She is called ‚ÄúDaddy¬¥s girl‚Äù and constantly worries about what her father is up to. Malene holds 9 chapters in See You Tomorrow. Sandra (born 1997). This young girl was the start of the whole novel, according to Renberg. He began writing about Sandra in 2007, as a single portrait of a na√Æve and desperate young girl madly in love with a no-good super-hot foster home kid, not knowing what to do with this text. A couple of years later it became the start of what became See You Tomorrow. Sandra is a Christian, she is upper middle-class, and she has never in her life told a lie or dared to break any rules, let alone laws. She is in the same class as Malene, who also becomes her best friend as the plot of See You Tomorrow thickens. She will turn sixteen in a few weeks. She wears a silver cross around her neck and has a dangerous secret. She is in love with Daniel William Moi and she will not live till the end of See You Tomorrow. Sandra holds 14 chapters in See You Tomorrow. Daniel William (born 1994). A foster home kid from Stavanger since his early childhood and one of the author's many portraits of damaged childhood, and perhaps the darkest one in his oeuvre. The reader never learns what has happened to Daniel in the past, but through Daniel's gothic language and nightmarish poetics, it is clear that he has witnessed severe dread. He is the lyricist of a metal band where he plays the drums. One of his lyrics goes like this: ‚ÄúI came down here to kill all of these girls / O Lord / Cause I¬¥m a bad man / But I¬¥m a real man‚Äù, echoing one of Renberg's modern heroes, Nick Cave, in its violent imagery. Daniel is seventeen years old, living with his foster mom Inger Ulland and her deaf daughter Veronika, and he is described as a boy ‚Äúthere were so many rumours about‚Äù, ‚Äúthe one in sixth grade nobody dared to talk to, the one all the girls thought was so hot with those deep eyes of his, and dangerous.‚Äù He is in love with Sandra, the meet at night after she finishes her evening job, but he is also drawn to the mystical Veronika. He drives a Suzuki AC50 and during the course of See You Tomorrow he becomes one of the novel's two murderers. Alongside Sandra, Daniel holds the most chapters in See You Tomorrow, 14. Tong (born 1971). The darkest individual in See You Tomorrow. Tong was adopted from South Korea as a child and does not know his biological parents. When the novel starts, Tong is in prison, at √Öna on J√¶ren. He is a member of the Hillev√•g Gang, but the reader learns that he has plans to ditch them. Every week Cecilie visits him and the two have had a sexual relationship for several months. He is a brutal and violent character. He returns from prison two- thirds into the novel. Tong holds 4 chapters in See You Tomorrow. Veronika (born 1997). Veronika is the most wicked and dangerous of the four young girls in See You Tomorrow. She is a politically uncorrect portrait from Renberg's hand, a character with a penchant for evil. Veronika is the daughter of Inger, and Daniel's foster-sister. She is also desperately in love with him and equally jealous of Sandra. Veronika is gravely hearing impaired. Veronika holds 5 chapters in See You Tomorrow. Shaun (born 1998). A hooded slacker from a dysfunctional family at Tjensvoll, next to Madla, in Stavanger. He sniffs glue and is the same age as Tiril. He is secretly in love with her. Shaun has a constantly running nose, he listens to porn-rap (Akinyele¬¥s ‚ÄúPut it in your mouth‚Äù, Greg Street¬¥s ‚ÄúSmell Your Dick‚Äù etc.), and he is the brother of Bunny and Kenny. To his own surprise he becomes Tiril's boyfriend. Shaun holds the least chapters in See You Tomorrow, only 1, chapter 91. One chapter of See You Tomorrow, the last one, titled ‚ÄúChange‚Äù, is not ascribed to a particular character. The Teksas-series See You Tomorrow is the first novel in the Teksas-series. The Video Boy (2006) is considered a pre-study, and Attack From All Sides (2014) is the second novel in the series. The eclectic Teksas-novels come with a unique blend of Nordic social realism, southern gothic and the rich pulp of Western popular culture. Renberg - both a former student of literature and a rock musician - draws on everything from heavy metal to horror movies and classic literature in his post-modern power-literature. The Teksas novels are insistently defying genre whilst exploring the possibility of incorporating a multitude of genres within their own realm; drama, comedy, tragedy, crime, goth, suspense, young adult, grit. The novels are collective stories written in the tradition of William Faulkner, clearly also heavily influenced by the modern revolution in TV-series; The Sopranos, The Wire, Deadwood. Attack From All Sides, plot summary: The brilliant Sandnes boy Ben is fed up with his stingy father and psychotic mother. He is bored from sniffing petrol with his older brother Rikki behind the abandoned boy scout headquarters. He hides a butterfly knife in his pocket and intends to set heaven and hell in motion in a quest for a new life. Sixteen kilometres further north lies the richest city in the world: Stavanger. It is the home of the Hillev√•g Gang: Uncle Rudi, Jan Inge and Cecilie. They live outside the law. Supporters of the Christian party, they are into heavy metal and don't give a damn about the rules laid down by an oil-rich society. The only thing they lack is a break that will yield big money. With his frightened older brother Rikki in tow, Ben leaves their childhood home and sets off on a journey that will be catastrophic for some and a shining success for others. Video Boy, plot summary: The novel Video Boy is a pre-study to the Teksas series. It was first published together with Grandma‚Äôs Got Cable TV (2006). The book tells the story of boys in the eighties and of friendship, music, TV and lost innocence. Video Boy is the story of P√•l and Hasse, aged thirteen and fourteen, who venture into a realm of darkness. They are tipped off about a boy called Video Boy, who seems to have every horror movie that was ever made. Video Boy is a frightening, weird, overweight and asthmatic teenager. P√•l and Hasse cannot quite figure out whether Video Boy and his sister actually live by themselves, cooped up in their dark house. P√•l and Hasse start coming over, bringing gifts in hope of being invited to watch scary movies. Their acquaintance with Video Boy and the others who hang out at his house becomes an introduction to the strange and frightful, a yet undiscovered world of horror and grit. Video Boy's place also houses something far more uncontrollable than the gory movies. In Tore Renberg's clean yet suggestive prose, the boys‚Äô experiences come across as an encounter with pure evil. Critical response Swedish literary critic Victor Malm (Sydsvenskan) wrote of See You Tomorrow and Attack From All Sides: ‚ÄúRenberg's novels are of international excellence ... See You Tomorrow is a wild, compassionate, first- rate thriller ... The second volume, Attack From All Sides, has also been published in Norwegian, and it is just as good ... The penmanship, the personification and the abundantly idiomatic dialogue make See You Tomorrow and Attack From All Sides brilliantly realistic prose, not just within Scandinavia, but among the international elite.‚Äù Expressen (Sweden) wrote ‚ÄúTore Renberg is one of this year's most brightly shining stars ... It is an incredibly good novel ‚Ä¶ See You Tomorrow is an achievement of technical power. In vital, maximalist prose, the characters' perspectives change in a weaving movement, slowly taking us to an amazing crescendo. The tone feels new, fresh and heartfelt.‚Äù Stephanie Boland (The Quietus) wrote of See You Tomorrow: ‚Äúaspects of the novel seem utterly ordinary, but taken in its behemoth whole, it dazzles ... See You Tomorrow is as boundary crossing as its author: defying easy genre designations, it centres around a crime story, but tempers its grit with romance, humour and a generous dose of pop culture.‚Äù In Denmark, Kristeligt Dagblad called See You tomorrow a ‚Äúwonderful novel‚Äù ‚Äì and you devour it in huge, greedy gulps.‚Äù, and The Danish Information wrote ‚ÄúIt is wild, but also wildly funny... It is fantastic! ... Realistic? Probably not, but insanely fun, and insanely well executed‚Äù. Jyllands-Posten awarded the novel five out of six stars and wrote ‚ÄúRenberg takes charge on the continent with See You Tomorrow. A book that involves both bursts of laughter and compassion‚Ä¶ a joyful display of literary expression.‚Äù In Norway VG, Dagbladet, F√¶drelandsvennen, Addresseavisen, Tr√∏nder-Avisa, T√∏nsberg Blad og Brabok.no awarded See You Tomorrow 6 out of 6 stars. VG called the book ‚Äúa prime example of the art of balance; innovative yet saturated with ancient tricks of storytelling‚Äù. Addresseavisen wrote: ‚ÄúSee You Tomorrow is impressive in every aspect - from its composition, language and credibility to its wit, palette and crescendos.‚Äô Aftenposten called it: ‚ÄòA criminal display of power‚Ä¶ a vitalistic tour de force‚Äù and Dagsavisen: ‚ÄúSix hundred pages of pure energy‚Äù. Dagbladet wrote: ‚ÄòWow, what a novel! ... Renberg's dark novel from Stavanger is filled with momentum, brutality, humour, poetry and musicality ... Renberg possesses a formidable talent for storytelling‚Äù.

One of the famous disciples of Josiah Conder. Early life and career Together with Katayama Tokuma, Tatsuno Kingo and Satachi Shichijiro, one of a group of renowned architectural students at the Imperial College of Engineering, Tokyo, and a protege of British architect Josiah Conder. Dispatched to London in 1901 by the co-founder of Mitsubishi, Iwasaki Yanosuke, Sone returned to design and supervise construction of the Senshokaku, an elegant two story mansion built on a steep hillside overlooking the Nagasaki shipyards. Keio University Old University Library Building in May 1912Sone's most famous work is the Old University Library Building (1912), still standing on the Keio University main campus at Mita. In collaboration with his architectural office partner, Chuj≈ç Seiichir≈ç, Sone produced a building in Edwardian neo-gothic style in red brick with white stone dressings. The Old Library has become possibly the most recognized landmark of the university. This late Meiji period structure employed the latest technology of the time, including steel beams and reinforced concrete floor slabs as well as electrical circuits, gas and steam heat. In the period between the end of the Meiji era and the outbreak of World War II, Sone and Chujo also designed many other buildings for Keio University including the Keio Corporate Administration Building and the First School Building, both still features of the Mita campus. Pre-1923 postcard with a view of the Mitsubishi headquarters in MarunouchiSone as superintendent, together with his former university instructor Josiah Conder as architect, was also responsible for many of the famed red-brick Mitsubishi buildings at Marunouchi, Tokyo. The Marunouchi district was designed as a showcase of earthquake resistant buildings and the Mitsubishi zaibatsu went on to construct over twenty such buildings on the site prior to the Great Kant≈ç earthquake of 1923.

Life and work Schwadron was born in Vienna and was the eldest son of Victor Schwadron, a co-owner of the ceramics company \\"Br√ºder Schwadron\\" with his brother Adolf. Schwadron started working as an architect in Vienna in the late 1920s, focusing on apartment interiors and furniture design, mainly for a wealthy Jewish clientele. His signature interior designs, furniture and lamps were typical of the restrained Viennese modernism of the early 1930s. By the mid-1930s, Schwadron was well established as an architect and his works were published frequently in European architectural and design magazines. In 1938, he fled the Nazis and went to New York. In 1939, he was chief designer for Rena Rosenthal's interior design company. Later, he ran his own design business, Ernst Schwadron Inc. on Madison Avenue for 30 years. Schwadron built one house in the U.S., which he built for himself and his second wife Gladys (Bradshell) in Cold Spring, New York in the late 1940s and which he called \\"Dream Lake.\\" He died in New York City in 1979 at the age of 82. Recognition In the early 1930s, the critic Else Hoffmann called Schwadron, ‚Äúone of the most hired architects of the younger generation who has created not only apartments for the cultivated Viennese Bourgeoisie but also received diverse commissions abroad such as a hunting lodge for an Indian prince or villas in the former Yugoslavia.‚Äù ... ‚ÄúHis taste and inventiveness‚Äù she writes, ‚Äútogether with his extraordinary knowledge about materials create apartments of highest functionality and a cultured mood.‚Äù She ends her article with a statement that, in hindsight, sounds prophetic, and also bitterly ironic: ‚Äúgreat journeys are awaiting Schwadron, journeys that will open up new worlds ‚Äî and new living circles. And new commissions will present themselves.‚Äù After Schwadron escaped the nazis by moving to the U.S. he received a few interior design commissions such as the design of the offices of the American Crayon Company (with Leopold Kleiner) and remodeling homes of fellow √©migr√©s from Vienna but survived by mainly working in furniture design. His work was published in architectural magazines, and reviewed even in the New York Times, but his signature design typical for the restraint modernism of Viennese \\"domestic lifestyle\\" (\\"Wiener Wohnraumkultur\\") was hardly understood or appreciated in the U.S. He died pretty much forgotten in the architectural world albeit his furniture pieces can still to be found in auction houses.

Early life Fatma Sultan was born on 1 November 1840 in the Be≈üikta≈ü Palace. Her father was Sultan Abdulmejid I, and her mother was G√ºlcemal Kadƒ±n, a Bosnian. She was the second child and eldest daughter born to her father, and the eldest daughter born to her mother. She had a sister Refia Sultan, one year younger then her and a brother Mehmed V, four years younger then her. After her mother's death in 1851, she and her siblings were adopted by Abdulmejid's first wife, Servetseza Kadƒ±n. In accordance with the custom, Fatma Sultan began to take lessons in the Quran in 1847, together with her sisters Refia Sultan, and Cemile Sultan, and brothers Murad V and Abdul Hamid II. First marriage =Engagement= When Fatma Sultan came of age, the sons of some of the most exalted personages aspired to the hand of the young princess. Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha and more especially his wife Adile Hanƒ±m, who was excessively proud, were particularly anxious that their son, Ali Galib Pasha, should become the Sultan's son-in-law. The other ministers wished to please the Grand vizier, and tried to induce their master to give the hand of the princess to the son of their colleague. After much pressing, the Sultan consented to the proposed union. =Wedding= Abdulmejid first purchased Mustafa Re≈üid Pa≈üa's palace and waterfront house in Baltalimani at a cost of 250,000 gold liras. He then gave freehold possession of these estates to his daughter Fatma Sultan, leaving the Pasha with a vast fortune to pay for the wedding expenses. Ali Galip Bey was appointed to Pasha's rank and made a member of the Meclis-i V√¢l√¢ (Supreme Court). The marriage which coincided with the most fervent period of the Crimean War, took place on 7 August 1854 in the √áƒ±raƒüan Palace. The bridal procession of Fatma Sultan left this palace, and traveled with \\"pomp and circumstance\\" partly by land and partly by sea, conveying the bride to Baltalimanƒ± Palace. The wedding lasted seven days, and was consummated on 10 August. =Issue= The next year she gave birth to a daughter, Cemile Hanƒ±msultan, who died in infancy. Second marriage After the death of Ali Galib Pasha in 1858 she married, Mehmed Nuri Pasha, son of Arif Pasha on 24 March 1859. The two had two children, Sultanzade Mehmed Fuad Bey and Emine L√ºtfiye Hanƒ±msultan. Both of them died young. Following the dubious conviction and exile to Arabia of her husband for complicity in the death of Sultan Abdulaziz, Fatma withdrew to her palace. In 1878, she and her siblings including her brothers Prince Ahmed Kemaleddin, and Prince Selim S√ºleyman, and sister Seniha Sultan, were all involved in the Ali Suavi incident with the objective of restoring Murad to the throne. She was widowed at his death in 1883. Death Fatma died on 26 August 1884 at the age of forty three and is buried in the mausoleum of Sultan Murad V at the New Mosque, Istanbul.

Hayashida was the subject of a Seattle Post-Intelligencer photograph which shows her, 31-years-old, holding her sleeping 10-month-old daughter, Natalie, while waiting to board a ferry from Bainbridge Island to the mainland with other Japanese American internees. The photo became an iconic image of the plight of approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans who were interned during World War II. However, the identity of the woman in the photograph remained unknown for decades. She was known only as \\"Mystery Girl\\" or \\"Mystery Lady\\" until the 1990s, when researchers at the Smithsonian Institution uncovered her identity and tracked her down. Hayashida was born on Bainbridge Island in 1911 to Tomakichi Nishinaka, a berry farmer, and Tomiye Fujita. Hayashida attended school in Japan for a short time, and graduated from Bainbridge Island High School. She married Saburo Hayashida in 1939 in Kitsap County, Washington; the couple had two children in Washington and one while imprisoned in Manzanar, where the family was held for a year. After Manzanar, the family was moved to the Minidoka internment camp in Idaho to be closer to relatives and friends. Upon release, the Hayashidas returned to Washington, to live first on Bainbridge Island, then in Seattle. In 2006, Hayashida testified in favor of a proposed memorial for Japanese American internees on Bainbridge Island before a U.S. congressional committee.

The Gending Sriwijaya dance is an Indonesian traditional dance from Palembang performed to honor and welcome the visiting special guests. The dance is often performed during state ceremonies, luncheons, dinner party or receptions, in front of the state's VIP guests, such as the head of state, president, king, queen and royal guests, minister and ambassador. For example, the Gending Sriwijaya dance was performed during annual Festival Sriwijaya in Palembang. The dance is based on the simpler Tanggai dance, and believed as the reenactment and recreation of the original welcoming ceremony commonly found in traditional Malay courts in the region, which demonstrate the Sekapur Sirih (bersirih or menginang) ceremony that offering the honored guests the betel leaf, areca nut and slaked lime. The dance is believed to be originated from the court of Srivijaya, and presented to describe the host‚Äôs welcoming hospitality, friendliness, happiness, and sincerity, as well as to demonstrate the beauty, gracefulness and cultured refinement of Srivijayan court. The dance is performed by nine young and beautiful women, wearing glittering songket-clad traditional costumes called Aesan Gede, completed with Selendang Mantri, Paksangkong and Dodot, and also wearing Tanggai gilded jewelry. It is believed that the dance costume combine various cultural influences, notably Malay, Javanese and Chinese elements. These women represent the princesses of Srivijaya, and are guarded by two Pengawal male dancers holding yellow parasols and gilded spears. In the background, a singer would sing the Gending Sriwijaya song during the dance performance, accompanied with gamelan and gongs musical ensemble. Today however, the live singer is often replaced by playing taped recorded music. The simpler version is usually performed without male guardians. Among the nine female dancers, there is one main dancer that wears the most complete and elaborated jewelries and costume, and acts as the prime lady. In the dance choreography, the prime lady would be the center and the foremost dancer. She holds tepak container as the props of Sekapur Sirih ceremony, and presents betel leaf, areca nut, and slaked lime for the honored guest to enjoy. On her sides, two other female dancers bring pridon, the brass containers traditionally used as spit container after the guests chew the betel nut. Today, however, the honored guest is not required to actually chew and spit out the betel nut, just the simple gesture of receiving or touching the tepak or pekinangan props would be enough. The Sekapur Sirih ceremony originally was only performed by king‚Äôs daughter, the princess of Srivijaya, accompanied by other princesses, noble young women, and dayang (ladies in waiting).

Robert W. Wood wrote in Forbes that the relationship between tax filing and obtaining health insurance may cause mixed feelings. Some are expected to feel they have benefited, but others may feel burdened by additional costs and/or filing requirements.  Premium Tax Credits  The Premium Tax Credit (PTC) is a refundable tax credit, payable by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to qualifying individuals who have obtained healthcare insurance through a healthcare exchange (marketplace) in the tax year. It can be paid in advance directly to a healthcare insurance company to offset the cost of monthly health insurance premiums. For the 2015 tax year 1.6 million taxpayers overestimated the amount they were supposed to receive for the advance tax premium. The average amount owing was $800.  Cost-sharing subsidies  Households with (Modified Adjusted Gross) income of 100-250% of the Federal poverty level (FPL) may also receive cost-sharing subsidies if they are enrolled in a silver plan through a healthcare exchange. The subsidy reduces the amount a household must pay out- of-pocket.  Individual Shared Responsibility Provision  Starting in 2014 all tax-filers must have healthcare insurance. Tax-filers who obtain qualifying healthcare insurance receive a 1095 form from an employer, a healthcare insurance company, or a healthcare exchange (marketplace). The 1095 serves as proof that the individual has obtained healthcare insurance. For the tax year 2014 only Form 1095-A provided by a healthcare exchange is required by the IRS. Individuals who were not insured during the tax year are required to make a payment when filing their tax return, unless they qualify for a tax exemption. An exemption certificate number is required in some cases for obtaining an exemption on a tax return. In 2014 the payment amount was 1% of income or $95 per adult ($47.50 per child) limited to a family maximum of $285 (national average premium for a bronze plan), whichever is greater. In 2015 the penalty increased to $285 per adult or 2% of income above the limit. The New York Times reported in February 2015 that up to six million uninsured taxpayers are expected to have to pay a penalty for not obtaining health insurance in 2014. = Americans residing outside the United States = Americans permanently residing outside the United States are exempt from the requirement to obtain health coverage in the United States. However they must file Form 8965 to obtain an exemption. Failure to file this form may result in a tax penalty. = American citizens and American residents residing outside the United States = American citizens and American residents residing outside the United States for part of the year can also get an exemption but only if they reside outside the U.S. for more than 330 full days during a twelve-month period. = Canadians residing in the United States part of the year = There have been some changes that may affect Canadians who reside in the United States part of the year: * In June 2014 a new cooperative program between Canada and the United States titled the Entry/Exit Initiative of the Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness Action Plan went into effect. * If a Canadian person spends more than 182 days within a calendar year in the United States, they may considered a U.S. Person for tax purposes under IRS rules. * Canadians who spend more than 182 days within a calendar year in the United States, can try to overturn U.S.-person-status by filing Form 8840 no later than June 15 of the year the tax return must be filed. * Being a U.S. person may have damaging tax effects on Canadians, because they must file U.S. tax returns on their world-wide income (even if none of the income is derived in the United States). * Even those who owe no tax may be faced with large costs associated with filing complicated tax returns in both Canada and the United States, including such forms such as FBAR and form 8965.  Small Business Health Care tax credits  Starting in 2015 Small Business Health Care tax credits are available to small businesses (25 employees or less) who obtain a qualified health plan offered through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace. Net investment income tax Higher income taxpayers, as well as taxpayers with sources of income that are defined as net investment income in the statute, pay an additional 3.8% tax to offset the costs of the Affordable Care Act.See I.R.C. ¬ß 1411(a), et seq. This tax first took effect in 2013. At the time, \\"higher income taxpayers\\" were defined as taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income of $250,000 for married couples filing jointly, $125,000 for married couples filing separately, and $200,000 for individuals or heads of household. The thresholds are not indexed for inflation, and so over time the tax will come to apply to most taxpayers. The tax is applied on income from interest, dividends, rents, royalties, passive activities, and gain from the sale of most properties.

From 1 April 2017 32 GP practices will leave the CCG and merge with Lancashire North CCG to form Morecambe Bay CCG. History From 1947 to 1974 NHS services in Cumbria (which did not then exist) were managed by Newcastle Regional Hospital Board which covered Cumberland, and the part of Westmorland covered by the Borough of Appleby and the North Westmorland Rural District and the Manchester Board which covered the remainder. In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. The whole of the newly created Cumbria came under the Newcastle RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and North Cumbria came under the Northern and Yorkshire Regional Health Authority. South Cumbria came under the North West (Mersey & North West) RHA. Cumbria from 1974 had three district health authorities South, East and West In 1993 South Cumbria was renamed Morecambe Bay District, which also included Lancaster. One Primary care trust was established covering the whole the county in 2002. It was managed by the North West Strategic Health Authority from 2002 until 2013. Cumbria CCG took on the responsibilities of the former PCT on 1 April 2013. Sustainability and transformation plan There are two plans for the county, one for West, North & East Cumbria, and one for Lancashire and South Cumbria. In March 2016 Amanda Doyle, Chief Clinical Officer of Blackpool Clinical Commissioning Group was appointed the leader of the Lancashire and South Cumbria Sustainability and transformation plan footprint. The West, North and East Cumbria plan is more advanced than most as it has been built on the Success Regime project. Some consultant-led maternity care services may move from the West Cumberland Hospital to Cumberland Infirmary Carlisle. In March 2017 it was agreed to reduce the number of community hospitals and develop more care at home. The proposed merger of North Cumbria University Hospitals with Northumbria Healthcare Foundation Trust was abandoned in April 2017. North Cumbria University Hospitals and Cumbria Partnership now work in a collaborative venture, with board members having positions with both trusts. This started with the same chief executive taking charge of both trusts in September 2017. In April 2018 it emerged that there were proposals to merge the STP for Northumberland, Tyne and Wear with those for North Cumbria and Darlington, Teesside, Hambleton, Richmondshire and Whitby; this would create the largest STP in the country with a population of 3.2 million. North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Alan Foster was made lead for all three STPs in October 2017. The 12 CCGs involved have set up a joint commissioning committee with delegated decision making powers. The West, North and East Cumbria sustainability and transformation partnership was one of four new integrated care systems established by NHS England in May 2018. Public health Suicide rates in the county are very high. In 2010-12, Copeland had the second-highest suicide rate in England, 15.5 per 100,000 people. The average rate in England was eight people per 100,000. In 2013-4 Barrow saw 251 admissions for self-harm, a rate of 372.9 people per 100,000. Primary care There are 82 GP practices in the county. Out-of-hours services are provided by Cumbria Health on Call. Rent-free accommodation for GP trainees is provided in Workington by Allerdale Borough Council and Impact Housing. Because of difficulties accessing secondary care, GPs are supported by the practice and community to manage more complex conditions within primary care than in more urban areas. Community care Palliative care is provided by Hospice at Home West Cumbria, St Mary's Hospice, Ulverston and Eden Valley Hospice, in Carlisle which also runs Jigsaw, Cumbria's Children's Hospice. The governors of Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust accused the success regime in April 2016 of seeing services at their community services trust as ‚Äúa cash cow to solve problems in the acute system‚Äù after it was suggested that inpatient beds at community hospitals could be focused on a smaller number of sites or developed as community hubs without inpatient facilities. Healthwatch Cumbria is an organisation set up under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to act as a voice for patients. NHS providers Mental health services in the county are provided by Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. Acute hospital services are provided by North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust and University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust though some specialist services are provided in Newcastle and Manchester. The North West Ambulance Service covers the county. The low density of population causes great difficulty in acute services. Hugh Reeve,Chair of Cumbria CCG expressed the problem: \\"If you put the world‚Äôs best obstetricians in Barrow, in five years‚Äô time they‚Äôll become deskilled because there isn‚Äôt enough work for them.\\" The Furness General Hospital scandal has dominated discussion of maternity services in the area for several years. Cumbria was named one of the 11 most financially challenged health economies in England in 2014. In February 2015 it was announced that the clinical commissioning groups planned for inpatient elective surgery at Westmorland General Hospital to be transferred to Royal Lancaster Infirmary and Furness General Hospital. Up to six GP practices will be brought together with community services in Barrow at a cost of ¬£12m. Lancashire North and Cumbria is one of the areas selected to pilot integrated primary and acute care systems under the Five Year Forward View. North Cumbria was one of three areas proposed for the new ‚Äúsuccess regime‚Äù by Simon Stevens in June 2015 in which NHS England will work in partnership with Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority to tackle in the local health economy. Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust is to merge with North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust in October 2019. About 250 staff in south Cumbria will transfer to Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust. Mental health services in the north of Cumbria are to be transferred to Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust. Maternity There are maternity units in Barrow, Whitehaven, Carlisle, Penrith, Kendal and Lancaster. In November 2014 the CCG invited the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to conduct a review a review of maternity services in Cumbria and the Morecambe Bay area.

Opened in 1913, it was one of the first purpose-built cinemas in Scotland. It is the only remaining example of an Atmospheric theatre in Scotland.  History  The Picture House, known locally as The Wee Pictures, was designed by the architect Albert Gardner, a student of architecture at Glasgow School of Art from 1901 to 1905. It opened in May 1913, and aside from a short hiatus in the 1980s, has been used continuously as a cinema since. The building is three storeys high with the projection room on the top floor, the balcony on the middle floor and the entrance on the ground floor. Gardiner was asked to refurbish the cinema in 1935, and did so in the \\"atmospheric style\\". This included a blue sky with moving white clouds, and the inclusion of small plasterwork buildings to recall a Mediterranean courtyard. Sound equipment was also installed in the cinema as part of the refurbishment. In August 2017 the Picture House, was voted as one of Scotland's six 'Hidden Gems' as part of Dig It! 2017 campaign. In November 2017, the National Library of Scotland announced that Campbeltown Community Business Ltd were donating the historical archive relating to the Picture House to the Library's Moving Image Archive. The archive includes newspaper cuttings, architectural drawings, advertisements, financial ledgers, and details of a 1938 plane crash which resulted in the cinema closing the night because the reels for that night's film were on the plane.  Restoration  In 2016, a ¬£2.5 million restoration was undertaken, with work to be completed in 2017. The work was carried out by architects Burrell Foley Fischer and Corramore Construction, with funding from various sources including the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Scottish Government and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. As a result of the restoration there are now two auditoriums, one of 192 seats, the other with 53 seats. There is a new foyer, caf√©, gallery and education space. The first pictures of the newly- refurbished cinema were released in November 2017.

Its head is the homonymous city. Bordered on the north by the department Trancas, east to Burruyac√∫ and Cruz Alta, south of Capital, Yerba Buena and Lules, and west to Taf√≠ del Valle. History The lands of the department, had been given, in colonial times, to encomendero Melian Leguizam√≥n y Guevara. In 1781, land purchase cited the name of Taf√≠ Viejo by Catalina de Ar√°oz de Facundo Tejerina y Barrera a Juan Clemente M√©ndez y Jos√© Mart√≠n M√©ndez. Later, in 1782, would be transferred to Maria Juliana Alzogaray. Until 1888, the town of San Miguel de Tucum√°n covered from Catamarca to Santiago del Estero. A new territorial division is then performed to form the departments of Taf√≠ and Cruz Alta. In 1907, the Constitution of Tucum√°n recognized the municipal government and the department of Taf√≠ gave rise to the town of Taf√≠ Viejo. Economy In the past the railway workshops located in the city of Taf√≠ Viejo were the engine of the departmental economy. Currently, the economic activity of the department has its basis in the production of citrus, especially lemon, being in town two citrus plants of advanced technology, and several packing. Also other activities have developed, such as plastic industry. Population The department Taf√≠ Viejo has two major population centers: the city of Taf√≠ Viejo and the municipality of Las Talitas, which grew up as a continuation of the capital city to the north. The city of Taf√≠ Viejo is third in number of inhabitants in the province, second only to Concepci√≥n, and the capital, San Miguel de Tucum√°n. Gastronomy The dining area has different features from other parts of Argentina derived in part from its origins as a railway junction (and therefore with little processing of their dishes) and workshop center. The recent growth of fruit production has led to the abundant incorporation of lemon juice or grated of it to many traditional dishes, being recognized in neighboring regions of his outstanding use. Seismic events The seismicity of the area of Tucum√°n is frequent, low-intensity, and a seismic silence means severe earthquakes every 30 years.http://www.inpres.gov.ar/seismology/historicos.php * Earthquake of 1861: although this catastrophic geologic activity occurs since prehistoric times, the earthquake of March 20, 1861 with 12,000 deaths, marked an important milestone in the history of Argentine seismic events since it was the strongest recorded and documented in the country.

It has been interpreted in many languages which also includes Persian and Braj. This page describes the interpretations of the story conducted by Todar Mal, the Hindu finance minister of Mughal emperor Akbar and Abu al-Faiz, Akbar's poet laureate. Faizi represent his work 'Nal wa daman' to Akbar. Both the interpretations include the central theme of love. In Todar Mal's version, the story of Nal (or Nala) and Damayanti has themes such as love, deceit and war between Hindu deities and Nal. On the other hand, Faizi talks about three oppositions which also play a role as themes. The first opposition is love and intellect (aql), the second opposition is between love and beauty (husn) and the third opposition is between Ishq and junnun (frenzy). However, one account is related to Bhakti which includes a lot of Hindu deities and connections between the supreme power and human beings. The other account is related to Sufism which includes a passionate connection between love and humans. A general statement related to Bhakti states that it is a devotional worship for one supreme deity, by whose blessings a person can achieve salvation. A Bhakti rendition of Nala-Damayanti: Todarmal‚Äôs ‚ÄòNector of Nal‚Äôs life‚Äô describes the famous story of Nal and Damayanti. The story is described from a Hindu traditional perspective keeping in mind the Hindu culture. The story includes themes of love, deceit and war. 'Nector of Nal's Life' is closely related to Bhakti of a Hindu deity called Hari. It starts off with Damayanti's life. Damayanti is a young princess whose beauty is beyond perfection. Due to this her mother insists on marrying her daughter to a God instead of marrying her to a mere human. They consider Lord Indra to be the perfect match for Damayanti. However, the goose that had been sent to Indra holding the invitation to the marriage was hit by a storm and lands in the kingdom of a handsome king named Nal. Nal takes cares of the goose and instead of continuing its journey the goose decides to choose Nal as the rightful husband of Damayanti. Lord Indra finds out that Nal is in love with Damayanti and demands him not to marry her or else he will have to pay for his actions. However, Indra realises that he must resort to deceit in order to win Damayanti, and so he decides to take the form of Nal. Damayanti is presented with two Nals and so she must choose the one she loves. \\"Anguished, she calls upon Hari who guides her actions and enables her to know which is truly Nal. Only when she looks into the eyes of both does she know her true love and garlands the real Nal\\" (Wadley 1999, 33). This is the first instance in the story in which the power of Bhakti is displayed. Another instance during which the notion of Bhakti is exhibited is when Hari is worried about Indra conspiring with Rahu and Ketu, Suraj and Sani. According to Hari, if their side won, they would cause Nal a lot of suffering. However, Hari says that if Nal was to remember Hari this whole time he would not be devastated. \\"But if this should happen and Nal continues to remember Hari throughout his twelve years of sorrow, he will return with more than he lost.\\" (Wadley 1999, 34). This notion of belief in God shows the true meaning of Bhakti in the Hindu culture. In addition, Nal and Damayanti were destined to struggle. Indra attacks Narvar the kingdom of Nal. All four planets jointly attack the king and destroy his wealth, grain and palaces. Looking at this Damayanti calls upon Hari once again to protect them. \\"But as the crisis worsens, Dumaiti calls out to Hari, asking for his help. Hari sends Narad to take Nal out of the city before all the beings in it die from Indra's onslaught\\" (Wadley 1999, 34). With the help of Hari, Nal and Damayanti reach the house of an oil presser because Sani cannot harm those who press sesame oil. Here, once again Nal's powers are active and he assists the oil presser by pressing much oil, making him wealthy. Sufism is the actualisation of the Truth by means of love and devotion. Love, Passion and Reason in Faizi's Nal-Daman,\\" in Love in South Asia:ACultural History also talks about the story of Nal and Damayanti however; a lot of Sufism elements take account in this version. Abu al-Fayz Faizi‚Äôs interpretation starts off with the story of Nal. Nal is portrayed as a man who is possessed by love. He has an illness of love because of which he is not the same. Nal blames love for his state but after meeting Daman (Damayanti) he does not think that love is evil. This is when the first opposition is introduced; love and intellect (Aql). In Sufism context, ‚Äúwhen love becomes excess, it can only lead to disaster, for this is the inevitable consequence of the neglect of the intellect (aql) and of notions of equilibrium that are crucial both for kingship and social order\\" (Alam and Subrahmanyam 2006, 116). After hearing many stories about love, he was possessed by it. Nal is told a story of an Indian princess (Daman) about whom there were many rumours around the kingdom. Upon hearing the story, he concludes that Daman is the reason for this sickness even though he had no direct or indirect contact with her. Also, a section in the story says that Nal is confused as to how the bandits broke into his treasure in spite of all the guards that have been patrolling it. This point is directly connected to intellect as Nal is taken over by love and cannot think straight. Another opposition that has been introduced in the story is between love and beauty (husn). In Sufism context love is vulnerable and ever-seeking whereas beauty is distant, refuses to be engaged and altogether is remarkable for its indifference. \\"Beauty fires arrows and love is wounded\\" (Alam and Subrahmanyam 2006, 118). Upon hearing of the beauty of Daman, Nal is mesmerised and falls further into the sickness of love. Lastly, the third opposition that has been introduced is between love and frenzy (junnun). After marrying Daman, Nal is completely lost to pleasure. He is shown to be possessed by frenzy of passion. His life is shown to have formed an alliance between love (ishq) and frenzy (junnun) against intellect (aql). He is so deeply in love that he loses his sense of equilibrium which is an important component of a great ruler. Nal's younger brother tries to take advantage of this situation by proposing a game of chess. Whoever won this game would win all the goods, treasure and the kingdom. \\"Nal, who is already a prisoner of junnun, falls into this whirlpool as its unsuspecting victim\\" (Alam and Subrahmanyam 2006, 130). Furthermore, another practice that portrays the element of junnun is the practice of Sati. In Hinduism sati was the practice of wife burning herself in the pyre of the husband. The wife would sacrifice their life along with their husbands. \\"The Sufi (follower of Sufism) brimming with love and fascination for his beloved, is thought to suffer immense pain, agitation, and distress over separation\\" (Rehman 2014, 3). The women would show their junnun for their husbands by setting themselves on fire because they cannot bear the separation. The two accounts Bhakti and Sufism are also very similar within these two stories. Nal is portrayed as an aashiq in Faizi's version and in Todarmal's interpretation Nal constantly falls in love with Damayanti once he hears how beautiful she is. In addition, when Nal goes to Daman's Swayamwara his competitor is a Pagan God compared to Indra in Todarmal's version. Another relevant point is the monotheism displayed. There are many Pagan Gods however; Nal only worships one ultimate God which is a little in parallel with the concept of Akbar praying to Allah. Nal is also shown to have amazing skills as a ruler. He makes a great king with a high intellect which again hints towards Akbar because he is known to be one of the greatest rulers in South Asian history. In conclusion, the re-interpretation of the story of Nal and Damayanti suggests a lot about the interaction between Bhakti and Sufism in early modern India. Akbar the great mystic king was interested in spreading the rich Indian works all around the Persian tradition. Due to this he chose this story and it exhibits the great interest he had in Hinduism particularly the account of Bhakti. Taking the love story of Nal and Damayanti and adding a metrical scheme of the story of Layla-Majnun is what Abu al-Fayz Faizi tried achieving. The love of Nal for Damayanti is portrayed in a Sufi way by Faizi who used the components like junnun, ishq and aql to exhibit his state in love. In addition, the re- interpretation of story also exhibits the great interest Muslim rulers had in some of the Hindu/Bhakti traditions. This includes the traditions of swayamwara and Sati. Both the interpretations have the component of swayamwara present. In the Bhakti account, Nal is competing with Indra and many other kings to win Damayanti. On the other hand, the Sufism account shows Nal competing with a Pagan God and other kings to win Daman. Also, the notion of Sati is an olden Hindu tradition. In this tradition, the married women whose husband passes away, sits in the pyre of her husband. This tradition explains that once a husband dies, the wife has lost all the hopes of living and so she must take her life as well. Faizi is shown to be interested in the tradition of Sati because he uses this notion in his Sufism account of Nal and Damanyanti's story. After Nal dies, Daman sits in his pyre and dies with him. With the help of such re-interpretations many Bhakti traditions passed over to Muslim and Persian cultures and many Sufi traditions passed over to Hindu culture. Therefore, this suggests that the interaction between the two devotional traditions is very strong. References Further reading *Alam, Muzaffar; Subrahmanyam, Sanjay (2006).

It is the fifth instalment of the modern Marlow series, between End of Term and The Thuggery Affair. Unlike the school stories for which Forest is best known, Peter's Room is set entirely at (or near) the family's home. Plot introduction The Marlow family, less their father and Giles, who are away at sea, spend their first Christmas at Trennels, the country estate they inherited following the death of their cousin Jon in an aeroplane accident. Eldest sister Kay is down from Oxford and spends most of her time closeted in the house's library and Rowan is preoccupied with her new role as farm manager. The main action of the book takes place in 'Peter's Room' - the loft of a disused outbuilding which Peter Marlow has been exploring, uncovering a variety of artefacts, such as a series of ancient farm record books. Snowed in at Trennels and spurred initially by Ginty's school project on the Bront√´ sisters' fantasy writings, they invent a swashbuckling story set in the imagined lands of Angora and Exina. Plot summary The fantasy created by the four youngest Marlow children (twins Nicola and Lawrie, Ginty and Peter) and their friend Patrick Merrick, takes up three chapters of the book. Matters reach a climax when Patrick, in character, wields an old pistol which Peter has previously found in the loft. Alarmed, Nicola knocks it from his hand, where upon it hits a table and is discharged, bringing their activities to adult attention, in the form of the Marlow's sister Rowan. Peter's Room is also notable for the beginnings of a romance between Ginty (recognised as the best-looking of the Marlow sisters) and Patrick. Nicola, previously a good friend of Patrick's, is left feeling sidelined, especially at a New Year's Eve party given by the Merrick family.

On his departure, Merritt received a ¬£52,500 severance package; no prosecution was sought by the university. Soon afterwards, both Pickering and Merritt's secretary were dismissed by the university. The secretary subsequently brought a claim for constructive dismissal against the university; an industrial tribunal found in her favour and she was awarded compensation of ¬£10,000. However, Pickering's career stalled. An unpublished report by Jeremy Lever QC into the events at Portsmouth concluded that \\"there was a causal link between the investigation into the vice-chancellor's expenses and Professor Pickering's departure from the university\\". However, ignoring both the Lever Report and the findings of the secretary's industrial tribunal, the National Audit Office (NAO) published a report in May 1997 that concluded that there was \\"no evidence\\" that Professor Pickering was \\"penalised or persecuted in any way\\" as a result of his actions as a whistleblower. The NAO report found that the vice- chancellor's secretary was also not victimised for whistleblowing. At the time of the publication of the NAO report, Pickering had been fighting for redress from the University of Portsmouth for four years; he sought to have the report withdrawn, arguing that it stood in the way of his chances of reaching a settlement with the university over his dismissal. However, Sir John Bourn, Comptroller and Auditor General of the NAO, wrote to Pickering saying: \\"I regret that you feel that you have been unfairly and unsympathetically treated by the NAO. It is of course for you to decide if you wish to take any further action on this matter. I think it unlikely that we can help you further\\". Pickering's campaign to have the NAO report withdrawn was later backed by Portsmouth MPs Mike Hancock and Michael Mates. Sir John Bourn acknowledged in a letter to the latter: > The report is critical of the way the governing body handled a number of > issues, including Professor Pickering's departure from the university [‚Ä¶ > and‚Ä¶] contains some criticisms of the treatment of whistleblowers. In > relation to Professor Pickering, the report does record that the > investigation (into the vice-chancellor's expenses) was not an insignificant > factor in the chain of events leading up to Professor Pickering's > departure\\". Pickering's challenge to the NAO report was unsuccessful. The university's new vice-chancellor, Professor John Craven, and its chair of Governors, Caroline Williams, refused to hold an internal inquiry into the whistleblowing affair, the latter saying: \\"As far as the university is concerned, the NAO has sufficiently dealt with the matter and there is nothing further for the university to do\\". Professor Craven said: \\"The university regards the NAO report as an authoritative, independent and definitive conclusion of the unhappy events which led to the resignation of Mr Merritt\\". Following repeated unsuccessful attempts to resume his career, Pickering suspected that he had been \\"blacklisted\\" for his whistleblowing at Portsmouth. In 2000, an inquiry by Elaine Storkey investigated his concerns that letters from a recruitment consultancy specialising in high-level educational appointments, Saxton Bampfylde Hever, \\"did not contain the truth\\". She found Pickering's concerns to be justified, concluding that: \\"The reasons he had been variously given as to why his applications were not put before the selection committees were not accurate\\", adding that Professor Pickering \\"would have made a very significant contribution\\" to higher education. Dr Storkey also said that the correspondence with Professor Pickering was \\"late, brief and somewhat dismissive\\". Storkey's inquiry nevertheless found that \\"Saxton Bampfylde had indeed promoted his candidacy as fairly as that of any other\\". The company admitted no liability but apologised to Pickering, through his lawyers, for not being as open as it could have been and for being \\"dilatory, dismissive and inaccurate\\" in its dealings with him. In 2014, Hampshire Constabulary reviewed the material relating to former University of Portsmouth vice- chancellor Neil Merritt's expenses; the force's chief constable, Andy Marsh, subsequently wrote a letter to Pickering in which he stated that it was \\"evident from this material that offences of fraud were committed\\" and that other allegations should also have been further investigated. He added: \\"I am sorry that the actions of Hampshire Constabulary seem not to have reached the standard expected of them\\". Other Positions Pickering served as a member of the General Synod of the Church of England (1980‚Äì90) and as a church commissioner (1983‚Äì90). He was president of Bible Churchmen's Missionary Society (BCMS)-Crosslinks between 1986 and 1992. From 2004 to 2006, Pickering was trustee and chairman of the Vocational Training Charitable Trust. He has been director and non-executive director of a number of companies, including Staniland Hall Ltd (1987‚Äì94).

Thus, synthetic methods towards substituted aromatic rings are always of great interest to chemists. Traditionally, regioselectivity on the aromatic ring is achieved by the electronic effect of substituents. Taking the well-known Friedel‚ÄìCraft electrophilic aromatic substitution as example, electron donating groups direct the electrophile to ortho-/para-position while electron withdrawing groups direct the electrophile to meta-position. However, with complicated systems, electronic difference between different C‚ÄìH bonds can be subtle and electronic directing effect alone could become less synthetically useful. The fast development of C‚ÄìH activation in the past few decades provides synthetic chemists with the powerful tools to synthesize functionalized aromatic compounds with high selectivity. The widely used approach to achieve ortho- selectivity involves metal-chelating directing groups, which forms a relatively stable 6- or 7-membered cyclic pre-transition state to bring the metal catalyst to the proximity of the ortho-hydrogen.Hartung, C. G.; Snieckus, V. in Modern Arene Chemistry (ed. Astruc, D.) 330‚Äì367 (Wiley-VCH, 2004).Colby, D. A., Bergman, R. G.&Ellman;, J. A. Chem. Rev. 2010, 110, 624‚Äì655.Lyons, T. W. & Sanford, M. S. Chem.

However, applying the same strategy to meta- or para- C-H functionalization does not work because the corresponding cyclophane-like cyclic pre-transition state is highly strained.Leow, D.; Li, G.; Mei, T-S.; Yu, J-Q. Nature 2012, 486, 518. Thus, while ortho-selectivity has been achieved by numerous catalytic systems, meta- and para-selectivity remains a challenge. Difficulty in achieving meta- selectivity In recent years, new strategies that override the electronic and steric bias have been developed to address meta-C‚ÄìH functionalization. However, before these discoveries, synthesis of meta-substituted aromatic compounds could be either limited or cumbersome. For example, before the development of the C‚ÄìH activation involving one-pot synthetic route to meta- substituted phenol derivatives by Maleczka and co-workers, the traditional synthesis requires 10 steps from TNT.Boele, M. D. K.; van Strijdonck, G. P. F.; de Vries, A. H. M.; Kamer, P. C. J.; de Vries, J. G.; van Leeuwen, P. W. N. M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 1586.Hodgson, H. H.; Wignall, J. S. J. Chem.

K.; Holmes, D.; Maleczka, R. E., Jr.; Smith, M. R., III Science 2002, 295, 305.Murphy, J. M.; Liao, X.; Hartwig, J. F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 15434.Zhang, Y-H.; Shi, B-F.; Yu, J-Q. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 5072 ‚Äì 5074. However, they are either limited to certain structure of substrates or are not highly selective. In recent years, several highly selective meta-C-H functionalization strategies have been reported which can override the intrinsic electronic and steric properties of the substrates and can apply to a wide range of substrate derivatives. The development of the modern meta-C-H functionalization strategies ‚Äúopen doors for numerous possibilities‚Äù for synthesis and catalyst development.Zhou, Y.; Zhao, J.; Liu, L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2009, 48, 7126‚Äì7128. One-pot synthesis of meta-phenol derivative involving meta-C‚ÄìH activation Conventional synthesis involving 10 steps and TNT starting material Recently-developed meta-selective C‚ÄìH activation strategies =Copper catalyzed meta-selective C‚ÄìH arylation= Reaction scheme of copper catalyzed meta-selective C‚ÄìH arylation of anilides In 2009, Gaunt's group reported a copper catalyzed meta-selective C‚ÄìH arylation reaction on anilide derivatives.Phipps, R. J.; Gaunt, M. J. Science 2009, 323, 1593. Despite the intrinsic ortho-/para- selectivity of the amido group, the arylation occurs exclusively on the meta position on a variety of anilide substrates. Remarkably, the regioselectivity is totally different from the earlier reported Pd catalyzed C-H functionalizations, where the amido group serve as a powerful ortho-directing group.Tremont, S. J.; Rahman, H. U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984, 106, 5759‚Äì5760.Daugulis, O.; Zaitsev, V. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2005, 44, 4046‚Äì4048. The method is robust under mild reaction conditions. It is compatible with a spectrum of substituted anilide as well as different bisaryliodonium salts. However, the meta-selectivity is lost when highly ortho/para-directing methoxy group substitutes one of the meta-hydrogen of the anilide, which marks the limitation of this method.highly ortho and para directing m-OMe overrides the meta-selectivity Despite the limitation, the paper was of high impact. It has been highlighted in a number of journals and news and was voted as one of the top 12 papers of 2009 by Chemical and Engineering News.http://www-gaunt.ch.cam.ac.uk/publications.shtml In a more recent report from the same group, Œ±-arylcarbonyl compounds were found to be good substrates for the copper catalyzed meta-selective C-H arylation.Duong, H. A; Gilligan, R. E.; Cooke, M. L.; Phipps, R. J.; Gaunt, M. J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2011, 50, 463‚Äì466. The power of the meta-selectivity overrides the electronic effect of different substituents, including the strong ortho/para- directing m-methoxy group.Reaction scheme of copper catalyzed meta-selective C‚ÄìH arylation of Œ±-arylcarbonyl compounds Although the copper catalyzed meta- selective C‚ÄìH arylation is quite successful, the mechanism behind the meta- selectivity is not completely understood. There are generally two proposed mechanisms both involving a Cu(I)/Cu(III) catalyst cycle. In Gaunt's original paper, he proposed a mechanism involving an anti-oxy-cupration step as the key to the meta-selectivity. First, the Cu(II) salt generates the active Cu(I) species through either disproportionation or reduction by nucleophile.Chen, B.; Hou, X-L.; Li, Y-X.; Wu, Y-D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 7668‚Äì7671. The active Cu(I) species undergoes oxidative addition with diphenyliodonium salt to generate a highly electrophilic Cu(III) species.Phipps, R. J.; Grimster, N. P.; Gaunt, M. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 8172‚Äì8174. While the Cu(III) species activates the aromatic ring, the amide oxygen attacks the ortho position, breaking the aromaticity and allowing cupration at the meta position.Maleczka, R. E. Jr. Science 2009, 323, 1572‚Äì1573. The intermediate then rearomatizes with base and undergoes reductive elimination to afford the meta-arylated product and regenerate the active Cu(I) catalyst. Mechanism of copper catalyzed meta-selective C-H arylation involving \\"anti-oxy-cupration\\" Alternatively, Li and Wu, based on DFT calculations, proposed a mechanism involving a \\"Heck-like four-membered-ring transition state\\". The amide oxygen first coordinates to the Cu(III) species generated from oxidative addition of Cu(I) triflate and diphenyliodonium triflate. Then, the phenyl group bonded to copper interacts with the aromatic ring at the meta-position, forming a four- membered-ring transition state. According to their calculations, the aromaticity is not completely lost during the transformation. In the last step, the Cu(III)-C bond breaks to regenerate the Cu(I) catalyst while the triflate ion abstract the meta-hydrogen to recover the aromaticity and gives the product. Alternative mechanism of copper catalyzed meta-selective C-H arylation =Meta-selective C-H functionalization assisted by a remote \\"end- on\\" template= Meta-selective C-H olefination assisted by a remote \\"end-on\\" template In 2012, Yu and co-workers reported a pioneering meta-selective C-H olefination using nitrile-containing templates to deliver the palladium to the meta-position via a macrocyclic cyclophane-like pre-transition state. The nitrile group is tethered to the aromatic ring by a removable linker. It coordinates weakly to palladium in an \\"end-on\\" fashion, which refers to the linear structure of C‚ÄìCN‚ÄìPd bonds.Schwarz, H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1989, 22, 282‚Äì287. The nitrile group helps accommodate the highly strained cyclophane- like pre-transition stateThe linear coordination is proposed to help overcome the high strain in the cyclophane-like pre-transition state that brings palladium to the vicinity of the meta-hydrogen. The template is designed as such that the flat arene linker keeps the substrate aromatic ring and the nitrile group coplanar. Bulky substituents on the arene linker \\"lock\\" the nitrile tether in the desired position. The delicate design results in high regioselectivity towards the meta-C-H bond. The templates can be removed easily to give toluene derivatives or hydrocinnamic acid derivatives in high yield. In their subsequent works, Yu and co-workers report the application of the same strategy in meta-selective C-H cross-coupling,Li, W.; Dastbaravardeh, N.; Li, G.; Yu, J-Q. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, 135, 18056‚Äì18059. meta-C-H acetoxylation and meta-C‚ÄìH olefinationTang, R-Y.; Li, G.; Yu, J-Q. Nature 2014, 507, 215. in a broad substrate scope. It is demonstrated that the \\"end- on\\" template not only work with the Pd(0)/Pd(II) catalytic cycle but is also compatible with the Pd(II)/Pd(IV) cycle. In all three works, addition of mono- N-protected amino acid (MPAA) such as N-acetyl glycine improves the reaction yields and enhances the regioselectivity.Cheng, G-J,; Yang, Y-F.; Liu, P.; Chen, P.; Sun, T-Y.; Li, G.; Zhang, X.; Houk, K. N.; Yu, J-Q.; Wu, Y-D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 894‚Äì897. =Mechanism= The mechanistic study of the palladium-catalyzed meta-selective C‚ÄìH bond activation with a nitrile- containing template was done by Yu, Wu, Houk and their co-workers. The DFT calculations suggest that the regioselectivity is achieved in the C‚ÄìH activation step, which is the rate-determining step. It proceeds via a concerted metalation-deprotonation (CMD) pathway, which means that palladation and deprotonation of the C‚ÄìH bond happen at the same time. Surprisingly, calculations reveal that the Pd‚ÄìAg heterodimeric transition state leads to meta-selectivity while the Pd monomeric transition state leads to ortho- selectivity. Pd-Ag dimeric transition state vs Pd monomer transition state for meta-selective C‚ÄìH activation The role of mono-N-protected amino acid is proposed as a dianionic ligand which participates in the CMD step assisting the deprotonation of the C‚ÄìH bond in the rate- and regio-determining step. =Meta-alkylation achieved by remote ortho-ruthenation and electrophilic-type substitution= Originally discovered by Frost and co-workers, the meta selective sulfonation of 2-phenylpyridine using a sulfonyl chloride coupling partner,O. Saidi, J. Marafie, A. E. W. Ledger, P. M. Liu, M. F. Mahon, G. Kociok-Kohn, M. K. Whittlesey, and C. G. Frost, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2011, 133, 19298-19301 utilising a ruthenium(II) catalyst. This reaction has been proposed to proceed via a similar method to that of the meta alkylation reported by Frost and Ackermann which involves a meta-selective C-H bond alkylation reaction with secondary and tertiary alkyl halides catalyzed by ruthenium(II) carboxylate catalysts.Hofmann, N.; Ackermann, L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, 135, 5877‚Äì5884.A. J. Paterson, S. St John-Campbell, M. F. Mahon, N. J. Press, C. G. Frost, Chem. Commun., 2015, 51, 12807-12810. The directing group first coordinate to the ruthenium catalyst. A reversible metalation takes place to generate the cycloruthenated complex as the key intermediates. The cycloruthenation activates the aromatic ring to undergo SEAr type alkylation at the position para to the C‚ÄìRu bond.Reaction scheme of Ru catalyzed meta-selective C‚ÄìH alkylation Meta-alkylation achieved by remote ortho-ruthenation and then electrophilic-type substitution Potential applications In Gaunt's and Yu's works, some derivatives of drug molecules and biologically active compounds were successfully functionalized in their meta-position. For instance, meta-arylated derivatives of anti-inflammatory drugs (S)-ibruprofen and (S)-naproxen were synthesized with copper catalyzed C‚ÄìH arylation. Meta-olefinated biologically important biphenyl, amino acid and Baclofen derivatives have been accessed by remote C‚ÄìH activation assisted by the \\"end-on\\" template. These demonstrate the potential applications of meta- selective C‚ÄìH functionalization in medicinal chemistry.

In this era, Viking activity started with raids on Christian lands in England and eventually expanded to mainland Europe, including parts of present-day Russia.Sprague (2007), p. 10. While maritime battles were very rare, Viking bands proved very successful in raiding coastal towns and monasteries due to their efficient warships, and intimidating war tactics, skillful hand-to-hand combat, and fearlessness. What started as Viking raids on small towns transformed into the establishment of important agricultural spaces and commercial trading-hubs across Europe through rudimentary colonization.Fasulo (2011), Viking Warfare. Vikings' tactics in warfare gave them an enormous advantage in successfully raiding (and later colonizing), despite their small population in comparison to that of their enemies.  Culture of war Vikings, according to Clare Downham in Viking Kings of Britain and Ireland, are \\"people of Scandinavian culture who were active outside Scandinavia... Danes, Norwegians, Swedish, Hiberno-Scandinavians, Anglo-Scandinavians, or the inhabitants of any Scandinavian colony who affiliated themselves more strongly with the culture of the colonizer than with that of the indigenous population.\\"Downham, Clare. Viking Kings of Britain and Ireland the Dynasty of √çvarr to A.D. 1014. Edinburgh: Dunedin Academic, 2008. Print, p. xv. Parts of the tactics and warfare of the Vikings were driven by their cultural belief, themselves rooted in Norse culture and religion, and vividly recalled in the later Icelandic sagas. In the early Viking Age, during the late 8th century and most of the 9th, Norse society consisted of minor kingdoms with limited central authority and organization, leading to communities ruled according to laws made and pronounced by local assemblies called things. Lacking any kind of public executive apparatus‚Äîe.g. police‚Äîthe enforcement of laws and verdicts fell upon the individual involved in a dispute. As a natural consequence, violence was a common feature of the Norse legal environment. This use of violence as an instrument regarding disputes was not limited to a man, but extended to his kin.Short (2010), pp. 41‚Äì42. Personal reputation and honour was an important value among Norsemen, and so actionable slander was also a legal category, in addition to physical and material injuries. Honour could be shamed from mere insults, where Norsemen were legally allowed to react violently. With this prevalence of violence came the expectation of fearlessness.Short (2010), pp. 40‚Äì44. Norsemen believed that the time of death for any individual is predetermined, but that nothing else in life is. Considering this, Norsemen believed there to be two possibilities in life: \\"success with its attendant fame; or death.\\"Short (2010), p. 42. The necessity of defending honour with violence, the belief that time of death was preordained, adventure and fearlessness were core values to the Viking Age.Short (2010), These principal values and convictions were displayed in the tactics of Viking raids and warfare. As in most societies with limited mechanisms for projecting central power, Norse society also shared traits of bonding through mutual gift-giving to ensure alliances and loyalty. One of the reasons many Norse went a-Viking was the opportunity to gather loot and wealth by trading and raiding. This wealth was then brought back to Scandinavia and used for political gain. This reasoning explains the Viking preference for attacking monasteries and churches containing riches and expensive relics that the Norsemen saw as valuable for trade. When vikings reach a certain age, they have to go to the next raid in memorial of the raid goddess, Deanne.  Raids  The Vikings preferred to attack coastal regions because these regions were impossible to block off from the enemies' standpoint.Sprague, Martina. Norse Warfare. The Norse were born into a seafaring culture. With the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Baltic and North Sea bordering southern Scandinavia, seafaring proved to be an important means of communication for Scandinavians, and a vital instrument for the Vikings.Fasulo, Viking Shipbuilding Despite reports since the 5th Century of the presence of seafaring Germanic peoples both in the Black Sea and in Frisia, and archaeological evidence of earlier contact with the British Isles, the Viking Age proper is characterized by extensive raiding, entering history by being recorded in various annals and chronicles by their victims.\\". These raids continued for the entirety of the Viking Age. These initial raids had a religious implication to them. Vikings would target monasteries along the coast, raid the towns for their booty, and destroy what was left. This caused mass fear amongst such monks, as they felt that it was punishment from God.Sprague (2007), pp. 10‚Äì11. There is also the complication of a lack of direct written sources about these raids from the Viking perspective. This leads to biased views of the raiders from Christians who were being attacked in their churches and lands . From their point of view, the Vikings were violent and evil heathens. Initially, the Vikings limited their attacks to \\"hit-and-run\\" raids. However, they soon expanded their operations. In the years 814-820, Danish Vikings repeatedly sacked the regions of Northwestern France via the Seine River and also repeatedly sacked monasteries in the Bay of Biscay via the Loire River. Eventually, the Vikings settled in these areas and turned to farming. This was mainly due to Rollo, a Viking leader who seized what is now Normandy in 879, and formally in 911 when Charles the Simple of West Francia granted him the Lower Seine.Sprague (2007), pp. 13‚Äì15. This became a precursor to the Viking expansion that established important trade posts and agrarian settlements deep into Frankish territory, English territory, and much of what is now European Russian territory.Abels (2009). The Vikings had taken control of most of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms by the 870s, which was after the time of the Great Heathen Army that swept the Anglo-Saxon rulers away from power in 865. This army focused not on raiding, but on conquering and settling in Anglo-Saxon Britain, being composed of small bands that were already in Britain and Ireland that worked together for a period of time to accomplish their goals. The Vikings were also able to establish an extended period of economic and political rule of much of Ireland, England, and Scotland during the Norse Ivarr Dynasty that started in the late 9th century and lasted until 1094.Taylor et al (2007), p. 39. In Ireland, coastal fortifications known as longphorts were established in many places after initial raidings, and they developed into trading posts and settlements over time. Quite a few modern towns in Ireland were founded in this way, including Dublin, Limerick and Waterford.  Warships  Much of the Vikings' success was due to the technical superiority of their shipbuilding. Their ships proved to be very fast. Their build was not designed for battle at sea, as this was a form of warfare that the Vikings very rarely engaged in, but these long narrow ships could accommodate 50‚Äì60 seamen who powered the ship by rowing, as well as a complement of warriors, and so able to carry sizeable forces at speed to land wherever advantageous. Due to their shallow draft, Viking ships could land directly on sandy beaches rather than docking in well-fortified harbours. Viking ships made it possible to land practically anywhere on a coast and to navigate rivers in Britain and on the Continent, with raids reported far up rivers such as the Elbe, the Weser, the Rhine, the Seine and the Loire, the Thames, and many more. Vikings also navigated the extensive network of rivers in Eastern Europe, but they would more often engage in trade than in raiding. Depending on local resources, the ships were mainly built from strong oak, though some with pine, but all with hewn planks that preserved the wood grain unbroken, resulting in light, but very strong and flexible strakes. Steering was accomplished with a single rudder in the stern. There was a relatively short mast that allowed fast rigging and unrigging. The low mast, built for speed when the winds were favourable, could often easily pass under bridges erected in rivers.Bruun (1997), p. 1286. These masts were designed to maneuver under the fortified bridges that Charles the Bald of West Francia created from 848 to 877. These boats have a shallow draft of around a meter of water.DeVries et al. (2012), pp. 291‚Äì92. Viking longships were built with speed and flexibility in mind, which allowed Norse builders to craft strong yet elegant ships. The close to 28 meters long and five meters wide Gokstad ship is often cited as an example of a typical Viking ship. Variants of these longships were built with a deeper hull for transporting goods, but what they added in hull depth and durability they sacrificed in speed and mobility. These cargo ships were built to be sturdy and solid, rather than Drakkar warships which were built to be fast. There is a mention of the Kn√∂rr being used as warships in poems written by skalds. Specifically, the poem \\"Lausavisor\\" by V√≠gf√∫ss V√≠ga-Gl√∫msson describes a Kn√∂rr being used as a battleship.  Seafaring military strategies  The fast design of Viking ships was essential to their hit-and-run raids. For instance, in the sacking of Frisia in the early 9th century, Charlemagne mobilized his troops as soon as he heard of the raid, but found no Vikings by the time he arrived.Winroth (2014), p. 71. Their ships gave the Vikings an element of surprise. Travelling in small bands, they could easily go undetected, swiftly enter a village or monastery, pillage and collect booty, and leave before reinforcements arrived.Winroth (2014), pp. 72‚Äì73. Vikings understood the advantages of the longships' mobility and used them to a great extent. Viking fleets of over a hundred ships did occur, but these fleets usually only banded together for one single‚Äîand temporary‚Äîpurpose, being composed of smaller fleets each led by its own chieftain, or of different Norse bands. This was most often seen in the Francia raids between 841 and 892. They can be attributed to the fact that it was during this time that the Frankish aristocracy began paying off Vikings and buying mercenaries in return for protection from Viking raids. Thus, there appeared rudimentary structures of Viking armies. Viking ships would rarely try to ram ships in the open sea, due to their construction not allowing for it. Vikings did attack ships, not with the intent to destroy them, but rather to board and seize them. Vikings raided for economic rather than political or territorial gains, and so were eager to enrich themselves through ransom money and slave trading. While naval Viking battles were not as common as battles on land, they did occur. As they had little to fear from other European countries invading the inhospitable regions of Scandinavia, most naval battles were fought amongst Vikings themselves, \\"Dane against Norwegian, Swede against Norwegian, Swede against Dane.\\"Sprague (2007), p. 174. Most Viking-on-Viking naval battles were little more than infantry battles on a floating platform. Viking fleets would lash their boats together, their prows facing the enemy. When they got close enough, the fighters would throw ballast stones, spears and use their longbows. Archers would be positioned in the back of the ships protected by a shield wall formation constructed in the front of the ship.Sprague (2007), p. 144. Depending on the size of the defending fleet, some would attack from smaller craft to flank the bigger ships.  Battle tactics on land  Viking units often lacked formation. They have been described as \\"bees swarming.\\" However, what they lacked in formation they made up with ferociousness, flexibility, and more often than not, extensive reconnaissance. This naturalistic sense of unconventional warfare is rooted in their lack of organized leadership. These small fleets brutally but effectively scared locals and made it difficult for English and Frankish territories to counter these alien tactics. Sprague compares these tactics to those of contemporary western Special Forces soldiers, who \\"attack in small units with specific objectives.\\"Sprague (2007), p. 27. Later in the 860s, the formation of the Great Heathen Army brought about a more organized type of warfare for the Vikings. Large squads of raiders banded together to attack towns and cities, landing from fleets comprising hundreds of ships. Viking raiders would anchor their largest warships before storming a beach. \\"It has been suggested that S√∂ 352 depicts an anchor and rope...It is perhaps more plausibly an anchor-stone...\\". However, it was more common practice for Vikings to beach their regular warships on land, where their battle tactics contained elements of surprise. \\"Vikings were notorious for laying ambushes and using woods to lay in wait for armies approaching along established roads.\\" If confronted by legitimate forces in raids, Vikings would create a wedge formation, with their best men at the front of this wedge. They would throw spears, and rush this wedge through enemy lines where they could engage in hand-to-hand combat, which was their forte. Some survivors of sea battles were pressed into guarding the ships during land skirmishes. Sagas of the Viking Age often mention Berserkers. These fabled Viking warriors are said to have spiritual magical powers from the god of war OdinWolf, Kirsten. The Daily Life of the Vikings. that allowed them to become impervious to injuries on the battlefield.Short (2010), p. 55. While these stories are exaggerated, the term berserks is rooted in truths about Viking warriors who were able to enter an intense, trance-like state whereupon they would \\"engage in reckless fighting.\\" These warriors were greatly feared by Christians in Frankish and English regions who viewed such men as satanic. The reason for these raids is unknown, but some have suggested that the increase in trade created a growth in piracy. Viking military tactics succeeded mainly because they disregarded the conventional battlefield tactics, methods, and customs of the time. They ignored the unspoken rules of leaving holy sites untouched, and they never arranged battle times. Deceit, stealth, and ruthlessness were not seen as cowardly.Sprague (2007), p. 374. During raids, the Vikings targeted religious sites because of their vulnerability,Winroth (2014). often butchering the clergy at these sites in honour of a Pagan god. Norsemen who sailed back to Scandinavia after raiding brought back their loot as a symbol of pride and power. \\"The Viking chieftains Sigfrid and Gorm 'sent ships loaded with treasure and captives back to their country' in 882\\". Warriors could be as young as 11 years old. Various basic physical tests were required to join the Viking forces, but these tests were considered easy to pass.  Common weapons  = Spear = The most common weapon in the Viking arsenal was the spear. They were inexpensive and effective weapons, and could also be used when hunting. In the late Roman Iron Age (ending c. 500 CE), the Norse were reputed for their preference of and prowess with the light spear. The wooden shaft of the Viking spear was between two and three meters long. There were two types of spears; one was made for throwing while the other was generally used for thrusting. The shafts were similar, but the tips of throwing spears were roughly thirty centimetres while the thrusting spears were close to sixty. Spears were sometimes used as projectile weapons in the occasional naval fight, as well as during raids onshore and in battle. This was in part due to the Norsemen's natural height and build, being taller and bigger than Frankish and English men at the time. The spear was popular because it was inexpensive and had a longer reach than the sword, making it the most common battlefield weapon all over the world, despite popular belief. = Archery = Another common weapon in the Viking arsenal was the bow. \\"In combat, archers formed up behind a line of spearmen who defended against a mounted attack.\\"Roth, Eric. \\"Viking Archery.\\" NewspaperDirect (Firm). Primitive Archer. Lufkin, TX: Steve Hulsey. Volume 17 (3) pages 38-40. Bows One bow found in an Irish grave was of yew with a rounded rectangular cross section flattened toward the tips, which had been heat bent toward the belly's side. Other bows, either complete or in pieces, were found made of yew and elm were found in Hedeby.Bows & Arrows of the Vikings, Dan H√∏j, Liljebjerget, Museum of Southwest Jutland, Ribe, 2019. Arrows Viking arrows have been found in pieces, usually of birch wood. Three feathers were used for fletching. \\"The Viking's long arrows are meant to be drawn to the ear for instinctive shooting, meaning that the archer does not sight on or even look at his arrow.\\"Roth, Eric. \\"Viking Archery.\\" Primitive Archer. Volume 17 (3) pages 38-40. = Axe = The axe overtook the spear as the most common weapon in the turbulent Migration Age, which saw much internal raiding and warfare in Scandinavia. It was the first \\"siege weapon\\" for raiding enemy farm hauses, where a spear or a sword could do little damage. The axe was commonly used for all kinds of farm labour and logging, as well as in construction and shipbuilding, and eventually adapted for use in Viking raids. Axes varied in size from small handheld broadaxes that could be used both for raids and in farming, to Danish axes that were well over a meter in length.Sprague (2007), p. 148. The popularity of the axe is often misunderstood in modern culture. The battle-axe was not seen as a superior weapon to the spear, and historical evidence shows that its use was rather limited. These axes had a wooden shaft, with a large, curved iron blade. They required less swinging power than expected, as the heads, while large, usually weighed only 0.8‚Äì0.9 kg, and as such were light and fast weapons, not depending on gravity and momentum to do most of the work.Winroth (2014), p. 26. The axe had points on each tip of the blade where the curve tapered off. This allowed it to be used to hook an opponent, while also doubling as a thrusting weapon.Short (2010), p. 50. The axe was psychologically intimidating to the people of Christian territories the Vikings sacked. King Magnus of Norway inherited his axe from his patron saint father, Olav Haraldsson. He named this axe Hel, the name of the Norse goddess of death. Christians associated this name with the word Hell. The axe of Magnus is still portrayed in the Norwegian coat of arms. = Sword = Swords had to be simple yet functional, and there was little to no design on them; however, once one was given a sword, a strong bond was formed between the weapon and its owner. It is believed that the sword was about 90 cm long and had a blade of 80 cm and a handle of 10 cm.Martens, Irmelin. Indigenous and imported Viking Age weapons in Norway ‚Äì a problem with European implications Almost every sword was double-edged, which meant that they could slash in different directions without having to worry about which side was the sharp side. Viking Age swords were common in battles and raids. They were used as a secondary weapon when fighting had fallen out of formation or their primary weapon was damaged. While there were many variations of swords, the Vikings used double-edged swords, often with blades 90 centimetres long and 15 centimetres wide. These swords were designed for slashing and cutting, rather than thrusting, so the blade was carefully sharpened while the tip was often left relatively dull.Sprague (2007), p. 145. A sword was considered a personal object amongst Vikings. Warriors named their swords, as they felt such objects guarding their lives deserved identities.Sprague (2007), pp. 139‚Äì40. A sword, depending on the make, was often associated with prestige and value due to the importance of honour in the Viking Age. No real method has been discovered as to how the Vikings made their weapons, but it is believed that individual pieces were welded together. While the Vikings used their own swords in battle, they were interested in the Frankish battle swords because of their acclaimed craftsmanship. Weapons often served more than one purpose. If two people were in disagreement, one would often challenge his offender to a duel of honour that was supposed to resolve the issue. This challenge would take place either on a small island or marked off area. A square with sides between 9‚Äì12 ft would be marked off with an animal hide placed inside the square. Each man was allowed three shields and a shield-bearer who carried the shield during battle. The helper could replace or carry shields for the combatant. The person who had been challenged was entitled to the first blow at the shields. The opponent could parry the blow and counter with his own strike; only one strike at a time was allowed. Once all of someone's shields had been destroyed he could continue to defend himself as best he could with a sword. This would continue until someone was injured; if blood fell on the animal hide then that person was required to pay three marks of silver to be set free and have his honour restored. =Defensive equipment= Only the wealthiest Vikings could afford helmets, as they were expensive. The one piece of defensive equipment that every warrior had was a shield. The shield itself was round and not oval-shaped which made it easier to carry and move with; however, it left the legs and some of the lower body exposed. Shields were made out of softwood, unlike any other shields in existence at the time. This was done in order to allow the shield to bend and give a small amount to prevent them from breaking as often. In addition to this, the weapons of their enemies sometimes became stuck in the shield, allowing the Viking an opportunity to kill them. Shields had handholds on the inside and were about 1 m in diameter (about 3 ft).

Major features on John Frost Square include the Newport Museum, Library and Art Gallery, the north entrance to Kingsway Shopping Centre and the headquarters of the Monmouthshire Building Society. History Chartist Mural John Frost Square was completed in 1977, following 16 years of planning.

With skeletons holding hour glasses it functioned as a modern momento mori. The Lonely Planet guide to Wales described it as \\"a hilarious clock tower that falls to pieces on the hour\\". The clock was dismantled in 2008 and put into storage, until 2011 when it was sold to local property developers for ¬£10,000 to re-erect on a 240 hectare Glan Llyn housing development on the old Llanwern Steelworks site. =Demolition and redevelopment= John Frost Square (2010) The Chartist Mural was demolished by the city council, despite protests, in October 2013.

Murro held the United States record in men's javelin throw from 1969 to 1982 and competed in the 1968 Summer Olympics. Career Murro broke the national high school record in men's javelin throw in 1967 while attending Essex Catholic High School in Newark, New Jersey, throwing 252 ft 8 in (77.01 m). In June 1968 he placed third at the national championships;\\"> three months later he won at the United States Olympic trials with a throw of 263 ft 9 in (80.39 m), defeating national champion Frank Covelli and qualifying for the Olympic Games in Mexico City. Murro was the top American at the Olympics, throwing 80.08 m (262 ft in) and placing ninth; Track & Field News ranked him as the world's 10th best javelin thrower that year. The magazine put him on the cover of its April 1969 issue. Murro continued improving in the next years, breaking Covelli's American record with a throw of 292 ft 8 in (89.21 m) in Tempe, Arizona on May 23, 1969. Murro won both the NCAA championship (representing Arizona State) and the national championship that year, with his national championship mark of 284 ft 3 in (86.64 m) breaking Al Cantello's meeting record from 1960.

Built in 1796, it served as Lovell's town hall and as a religious meeting place until 1852, when the Lovell Village Church was built. From then it has served strictly civic functions, and is still the location of Lovell's town meetings and voting. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history The meeting house is a single story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, and resting on a modern concrete foundation capped in granite. It occupies part of a larger lot in the village of Center Lovell, which also includes the town's traditional parade ground. The building is wide and long. The main facade faces south (not toward the street, and is five bays wide. The center bay houses the entry, which is sheltered by a small gabled hood supported by simple wooden brackets, and is reached by three wooden steps. The entry is flanked by two sash windows on each side. The building has simple wood-block quoining at the corners. The street-facing (western) facade has a centered group of four narrow one-over-one sash windows, above which is a decorated wooden triangular panel. The gable peak is adorned with Stick style wooden truss elements, behind which flushboarding finishes the wall, which is otherwise clapboarded. The interior of the building is a single large open space, with a raised platform stage at the eastern end, with seating in the remainder of the space. The stage is accessed by stairs at either end, with railings that have turned balusters. A beam extends across the space aligned with the front of the stage, and the otherwise open attic area is partitioned, creating the effect of a proscenium arch. The town's voting equipment is normally placed on the stage, and there is a wood stove at the southeast corner, where the door to the town vault is also located. The roof is supported by a series of open modified King post trusses. The walls are finished in pine wainscoting up to the windows, with an early form of gypsum board above. The town of Lovell was settled in 1788. When the town built the meeting house in 1796-98, it had two stories, providing a gallery space on the second level. It is believed that it had, on the eastern wall, a traditional colonial-era pulpit board and elevated pulpit, and the floor was filled with box pews, although much of this work was not completed until c. 1820. Complaints about the draftiness of the building prompted a decision in 1819 to lower the ceiling, and it was apparently lowered again in 1827. The building was used for both civic and religious purposes until 1852, when the church congregation moved to the newly built Lovell Village Church. Some of the religious elements of the interior remained behind, however, and were only removed during alterations in 1890. Around 1920 the town authorized further changes to facilitate the staging of theatrical productions. The town's offices are located in a modern building elsewhere in Center Lovell. This building continues to be used for town meetings and as a polling place.

On November 18, 2015, Sutter announced that FX had cancelled the series after one season. Overview Set in early 14th century Wales, Wilkin Brattle, a Welsh knight in the army of King Edward I of England, is betrayed by an Englishman with a lust for power who leaves him for dead. When Brattle is near death, a child apparition implores him to lay down his sword and follow the path of a different man. Later in life, Brattle lives as a happily married peasant farmer in Wales, awaiting the birth of his child. His new life of peace is shattered by the unbearable taxes assessed on the peasants by \\"Baron\\" Erik Ventris, the man who had betrayed Brattle. Pressured by his fellow villagers, Brattle leads a raid on the Baron's tax collector, which provokes Ventris' revenge killing of all the women and children in Brattle's village, and the burning of that village. Brattle's raiders battle with the Baron, ending in Ventris' death and the massacre of his troops. Revenge, however, is not complete, as the raiders want all the soldiers who slaughtered their kin to die by the sword. Brattle assumes the identity of Gawain Maddox, a journeyman punisher (executioner) injected into the plot just moments before the Baron's death. Brattle, aka Maddox, enters Castle Ventris intending to identify the remaining murderers so his fellow raiders can exact revenge. However, castle intrigue traps Brattle in his new alias and disdainful profession, forcing him to lead a double life while trying to determine whether this new path is the one the apparition has chosen for him, or if he has been led astray. The plot partially involves the fallout from the real-life Welsh revolt of 1294‚Äì95 against English rule, led by Madog ap Llywelyn.

It's about as morally complex a profession as you can imagine\\". Grazer pitched the idea to 20th Television chairmen Dana Walden and Gary Newman. The two, along with Fox21 president Bert Salke, suggested Sutter as writer. After meeting with Grazer and taking some time to contemplate the idea, Sutter built a whole world around it, and the pitch was taken to FX. Sutter explained the writing process and obstacles for the show on his vlog: \\"It's sort of fun of jumping into completely different world, completely different time, completely different vernacular, it's a toughest thing for me right now with the pilot is the story is all broken on my board here but you know trying to find different rhythms of speech and vernacular\\". Sutter held his fans hostage who were eagerly waiting for his new project. \\"I'm not writing it on period speech just because there's no actual recording of what that vernacular sounded like with intonation and everything.\\"http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/576543/20141219/bastard- executioner-sons-anarchy-kurt-sutter-katey.htm#.VJmwcV4CA The series was announced in December 2013. Sutter began writing the scripts once the last episode of Sons of Anarchy had wrapped up in late 2014. He reported, Katey Sagal is \\"definitely...involved\\" in the series. Paris Barclay, who directed 15 episodes of Sons of Anarchy, directed The Bastard Executioner pilot and was executive producer. Charles Murray, a writer/co-executive producer of the last two seasons of Sons of Anarchy, was a writer/co-executive producer on The Bastard Executioner series. Nichole Beattie was another Sons of Anarchy alumna on The Bastard Executioner writing staff; she has also written extensively for AMC's The Walking Dead and Rubicon. The Bastard Executioner was filmed in Wales, United Kingdom, and featured a mostly British cast. Barclay left for the UK on January 2 to work on casting and location matters. Sutter stayed in the US to finalize the script. He joined Barclay a few days later in the United Kingdom. The draft of the pilot script was sent to the studio executives at FX on the 7th of January. During mid-January, Sutter and Barclay visited several possible shooting locations in Wales, including Caerphilly Castle and Fforest Fawr. Filming began on 23, 2015. The show's producers spent 10 months considering locations in Wales with the help of the Welsh Government‚Äôs Wales Screen service, which encourages film and television productions to use locations, crews, and facilities throughout Wales. The project was one of the first major productions to move into Pinewood Studios' new facility in Cardiff. The set for the series, in the form of a medieval village with a small castle, was constructed to the west of Cardiff at Dragon International Film Studios in Llanilid. On May 22, 2015,The Bastard Executioner was picked up for a 10-episode series for fall launch. On November 18, 2015, FX and Sutter announced that Sutter had cancelled the series.  Reception  Reviews for The Bastard Executioner were polarized, with praise being directed toward the action sequences, writing, and acting, and criticism toward the pacing, limited development, and excessive violence. It holds a rating of 49% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 53 critics; the website's consensus reads: \\"Kurt Sutter's The Bastard Executioner doesn't want for dark thrills, but it unfortunately has more enthusiasm for brutality and gore than necessary narrative focus.\\" Out of 37 reviews in Metacritic, the show holds a rating of 55.

As an athlete, he experienced 15 reported concussions; however, he is suspected of having experienced many more than 15, especially considering his history of concussions before college. An examination by Dr. Ann McKee, a Boston University neuropathologist at the BU Brain Bank, conflicted with the original autopsy findings, diagnosing Kostageorge with stage one CTE, though she qualified her diagnosis by stating that it was \\"impossible to definitively link his suicide to any brain trauma he had sustained in sports.\\" Karageorge was remembered by the student body in a candlelight vigil, which took place on Ohio State University's Oval, next to a statue of university president William Oxley Thompson, where remembrance ceremonies are traditionally held by the student body.

He was then, from 2005 till 2009, Parliamentary Secretary of State in the Health ministry under Federal Chancellor Merkel. Life =Early years= Schwanitz was born in Gera, a long established city some 75 km (40 miles) west of Dresden, and then in the heart of East Germany's southern industrial region. After successful completion of his school career he undertook a professional training in construction work. He then studied Business administration at Jena and Law at East Berlin. He emerged from his tertiary education with degrees in Engineering Economics and in Jurisprudence, before taking a position as a research assistant in the Business Administration department at the Technology Institute at Zwickau =Politics= In October 1989 Rolf Schwanitz joined New Forum, a political movement originating in Zwickau and associated with the Peaceful Revolution that soon afterwards put an end to the German Democratic Republic as a stand-alone one-party state. In November 1989, in the same month that the Berlin Wall was breached, he switched to the (in East Germany newly refounded) SDP (party). Following German reunification in August 1990 the new party quickly merged with its (till now, and since 1946, purely West German) counterpart, which made Schwanitz a member of the SPD (party). Between 1993 and 2010 he served as the party's deputy regional chairman in Saxony. In 2009, following the resignation of Thomas Jurk, and until his successor Martin Dulig was elected, Schwanitz briefly served as acting regional party chairman in Saxony. He is also a member of the leadership circle of the Seeheimer Kreis, a working group of SPD politicians that describes itself as \\"undogmatic and pragmatic\\". =Religion= A party colleague has described Schwanitz as \\"a passionately convinced atheist\\".Conversation with Wolfgang Thierse Since 2010 he has supported the creation of a working group on \\"Secularism and secularists in the SPD\\".‚ÄûLaizistische Sozis‚Äú The objective of such a group should be that \\"Religious and non-religious communities must rank equally, and enjoy the same level of respect from the state, acting on behalf of society, with no privileges allowed to one side.\\"‚ÄûReligionsgemeinschaften und auch Religionsfreie m√ºssen dieselbe Rangigkeit und dieselbe Wertsch√§tzung in der Gesellschaft durch den Staat genie√üen, aber keine Privilegierung zu einer Seite‚Äú He wants to end \\"gender based discrimination involving those working with the church. The churches enjoy exemptions involving decisions on promotions and pay levels\\".‚ÄûSchlechterstellung der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter im kirchlichen Bereich. Wir haben dort Sonderrechte, dass das Mitbestimmungsrecht nicht gilt, wir haben dort Sonderrechte, was Tarifsituationen betrifft‚Äú He goes on, \\"If a third of the German population, sharing the non-religious perspective, also recognise the issue, then we need to raise it up the public agenda with an SPD working group\\".‚Äûwenn ein Drittel der Bev√∂lkerung in Deutschland aus Konfessionsfreien besteht, die dieses Thema auch sehen, dann muss man einen solchen Arbeitskreis quasi auch auf Augenh√∂he in der SPD auch aufbauen‚Äú Schwanitz was very sharply critical of the papal visit to Germany in September 2011, when he was one of the 50 or so members who boycotted Pope Benedict's high-profile speech to the Bundestag. =National politics= Following the East German national election on 18 March 1990, between March and October 1990, Rolf Schwanitz was a member of the country's first (and last) freely elected People's Chamber (Volkskammer), by now a member of the SDP and representing the Karl-Marx-Stadt electoral district. He was one of the 144 deputies in the chamber who on 3 October 1990, as part of the German reunification process, became members of the Bundestag (National Assembly) of a reunited Germany. In the first post unification election, which took place in December 1990, Schwanitz's name was on the SPD list for the Saxony electoral district and he was elected to the Bundestag. He enjoyed electoral success in the Bundestag elections in 1994, 1998, 2002, 2005 and 2009, but did not contest a seat in 2013. In the 2005 election he attracted nationwide criticism with an election poster showing the coffins of US soldiers, inside a cargo plane, being returned from the Iraq War. The headline on the poster stated, \\"She would have sent [German] soldiers\\" (\\"Sie h√§tte Soldaten geschickt\\"). The \\"She\\" in question was the (then) opposition leader Angela Merkel. The poster was accompanied by a recommendation for the voters in Saxony to vote for the SPD candidate, Rolf Schwanitz. Although Schwanitz subsequently served in a coalition government under Merkel, the context of the 2005 election was one in which their respective parties were competing nationally for votes, and the issue of whether Germany should send troops to Iraq in defiance of a pacifist tradition established since 1945, and in support of the US army, was one seriously divisive issue between mainstream parties of the moderate left (SPD) and the moderate right (CDU). The poster, intended to highlight Angela Merkel's position on the Iraq War, instead attracted national media criticism of Schwanitz. The hard hitting image of American coffins was considered tasteless: use of the image by the (originally East German) socialist atheist Schwanitz for electoral purposes had overstepped the boundaries of acceptability. =Ministerial Office= During 1990, Rolf Schwanitz served in East Germany's last government under Prime Minister Lothar de Maizi√®re. Schwanitz was appointed a Parliamentary Secretary of State, working in the department of the Justice Minister Kurt W√ºnsche. The 1998 election ended the 16 year chancellorship of Helmut Kohl. The SPD and Green parties received respectively 40.9% and 6.7% of the national vote. Candidates from receiving less than 5% of the national vote are excluded from the Bundestag, so that the combined 47.6% of the national vote translated into 345 of the 669 seats in the Bundestag, creating a majority for a new SPD/Green coalition government under Gerhard Schr√∂der. On 27 October 1998 Rolf Schwanitz was appointed Minister of State in Schr√∂der's Chancellery. At the same time, between 1998 and 2002, he was Federal Government Commissioner for the New Federal States (i.e. former East Germany). The outcome of the 2002 election was close, but it enabled Gerhard Schr√∂der to form a second coalition government with the Greens: this time Rolf Schwanitz was not a member of it. The largest two parties both lost ground in the 2005 election, and in the end a \\"grand coalition\\" was formed between the two of them, leaving the business of opposition to the less mainstream PDS, The Greens and the FDP. Within the governing CDU/CSU/SPD coalition government, now led by Angela Merkel, Schanitz again received a job, this time as Parliamentary Secretary of State for Health, working with the Health Minister Ulla Schmidt (SPD). The principal losers in the 2009 election were the SPD. Rolf Schwanitz resigned his office as the Social Democrats went into opposition.

The album was released in June 1985. Background In 1984, Avsec had spare time to begin working in his home studio in Twinsburg on demos which he began recording in winter 1984. The 40-50 songs he wrote had not been intended for a solo project, but were demos for Donnie Iris and the Cruisers. However, after being offered a solo album deal with CBS Records, Avsec selected ten of his recordings for a solo project under the moniker Cellarful of Noise. Cruisers' former drummer Kevin Valentine helped produce the record. In a 1988 interview with AOR Basement, Avsec revealed how the project came to be released by CBS: \\"I had some spare time and I was really just experimenting in my basement with an eight-track and some midi-equipment. My manager, Mike Belkin, shopped the tapes and CBS put it out, virtually as it was - although it was really just me messing around. Right after it came out, though, I wanted to get more serious about it and make a better sounding record.\\" In a 1985 interview with Scene magazine, Avsec said: \\"It's just a little hobby, I always like to be busy doing something. I've got an eight-track studio in my basement, and one day I was talking to Mike Belkin and I told him I'd like to try writing some songs. I didn't really feel like getting involved with another artist or anything like that. I've done a lot of that. I just felt I needed to be by myself. I wanted to be able to write lots of songs without having to try to write certain kinds of songs.\\" Speaking of Kevin Valentine, he said: \\"Kevin's pretty talented in that area [production]. He has always been more than a drummer. He's got good ears and he knows what to play. He thinks of the record as a whole. I'm the artist working on the thing, and then he can come in there, and I really need his input and opinion. And he can co-produce the album, which is what happened. I basically did all the vocals, keys and bass. We weren't exactly dealing with state of the art equipment, but we got into the spirit.\\" The other musician to work on the album was Alan Greene, who like Valentine, was part of the band The Innocents at the time. The album's only single, \\"I'd Walk the Line\\", was released in America by CBS and in the Netherlands by Epic. The B-Side was the album track \\"Something Goin' On with Us\\". It was released on both 7\\" and 12\\" vinyl, with the latter version adding a third track; \\"Easier Said than Done\\", also from the album. After releasing the album, Avsec said there were no plans for any live gigs to support it, though a video for the single was put forward as a possible option. This never came to fruition. Avsec and Iris maintained that Donnie Iris and the Cruisers was still their main focus, and that they wanted to continue to release new albums with the band. The band released No Muss...No Fuss in 1985 and returned to the studio again in 1986 to record a new album Cruise Control; however, a lawsuit with the band's former label MCA resulted in the shelving of the album. Later, the band's label HME went out of business and the band became an unsigned act. Avsec then began work on the second Cellarful of Noise album Magnificent Obsession, which featured Iris' involvement. Released in 1988, the album produced a moderately successful single, \\"Samantha (What You Gonna Do)\\". Recording and release The album was recorded and mixed within Avsec's basement studio \\"The Cellar\\", in Twinsburg, Ohio. It was mastered by Jack Skinner at Sterling Sound in New York.Cellarful of Noise - Cellarful of Noise - Vinyl LP back credits - CBS Records - BFZ 40134 The album was released on vinyl and cassette only, in America via CBS Associated Records, and on vinyl in the Netherlands via Epic Records. In America the album was also manufactured and distributed by the CBS label. To date it has not been released on CD, and has remained out-of-print since its original release. Track listing Critical reception Upon release, Billboard wrote: \\"Mark Avsec is the driving force behind this pop/rock project, which recalls Iris' robust style in its tight arrangements, dramatic vocal style and solid writing, aimed at mainstream.\\"Billboard magazine - Reviews: Albums - August 3, 1985 - page 74 Richard Paton of The Toledo Blade stated: \\"The name suggests post-punk mayhem, but in fact this is an album of tightly crafted power pop and rock with more catchy hooks than a fisherman's hat. The hooks get you from the opening track, \\"I'd Walk the Line,\\" while other songs such as the tougher \\"Heartwrecker,\\" have an almost anthemic quality. On \\"Easier Said than Done\\" the rock is wrapped in lush harmony. The album suffers somewhat from a lack of variety, but the energy it exudes is contagious.\\" Cash Box commented: \\"With a vocal and melodic approach reminiscent of Frankie Valli, Cellarful of Noise comes up with a promising debut.

He embraced a military career at the age of 17, and progressed through the ranks of service. In 1808, he was appointed to the 3rd Division in Metz, where he remained until his retirement in 1814. He was among the first recipients of the Legion of Honor in 1804. Mathieu Richard Auguste Henrion, Roget de Belloquet.Biographical Dictionare, vol. 2, M√©quignon; Lagny, 1834, p. 345. Service Born on 20 October 1760 at Lorry-Devant-le-Pont, in the Kingdom of France, Roget entered military service in the 7th regiment of chasseurs a cheval (light cavalry), on 13 May 1777, as a simple trooper. In 1793, as a sous-lieutenant he served in Custine's army at the Siege of Mainz. Later he served with Marceau-Desgraviers and Kleber to quell the Vendee uprising. By the end of uprising in the Vendee, he had reached the grade of adjutant general. Recalled to the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, General Desaix gave him command of the 13th Dragoon Regiment, which had achieved battle honors at Valmy four years earlier; at the Battle of Dierstein, he led the 13th in a charge and defeated the Austrian Regiment D'Alton, taking two flags and five cannons. He then turned to Offenburg, where he chased out the Austrians and pursued them beyond Gengenbach; in the second action, he took four guns from the Austrians, as well as forty boxes of ammunition, and a large number of prisoners. Emile Begin, Roget de Belloquet.Biographie de la Moselle. Verronnais, 1832, pp. 151-155. The Alpine Rhine, although near the source of the river, is wide and difficult to cross under flood conditions. In the Swiss Campaign of 1799, under overall command of Massena, he led the 13th Dragoons in Brigadier General Oudinot's division in the Alpine Rhine (the Rhine between Switzerland and Liechtenstein). He was instructed to cross the Rhine at a ford near Verdenberg. The sudden rise of the river made this impractical and several troopers drowned in the attempt. Colonel Roget led his regiment across the river under fire from Habsburg sharpshooters concealed on the other side; having reached the east bank, he ordered the remaining dragons on the far bank to bring the artillery across. Under the cover of artillery fire, Roget drove the Austrian defenders back past the village of Eschen. The next day, after a lively fight, Colonel Roget led a successful cavalry charge against the Regiment O'Donnell and Regiment Modena, taking a number of prisoners, five cannons, and 200 horses.See Lawrence Shadwell, Mountain warfare illustrated by the campaign of 1799 in Switzerland: being a translation of the Swiss narrative, compiled from the works of the Archduke Charles, Jomini, and other... London: Henry S. King, 1875,185. Subsequently, he was promoted to general of brigade. In 1799, under command of Michel Ney, he participated in the Battle of Winterthur.Digby Smith, \\"Clash at Winterthur,\\" Data Book, p. 157. He commanded the 13th Dragoons (after 4 March 1797). He fought at the Battle of Austerlitz, where he also commanded the 10th and 11th dragoons, of Walther's division. By 30 December 1806, he had been promoted to general of division and in 1808, he commanded the 3rd division at Metz. In January 1813, the Allied offensive had reached the border regions between the German states and France. In anticipation of invasion, Marshal Marmont investigated all preparations for the defense of Metz, and found the state of troops and defenses lacking. He accused Roget of gross incompetence, and removed him from his post as military commander of Metz, appointing Durette in his place.Michael V. Leggiere,The Fall of Napoleon: The Allied invasion of France, 1813-1814\\\\. Vol. 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 373. Upon the Bourbon Restoration, Roget retired to Remelfing where he died on 9 January 1832. Honors On 14 June 1804, he was named Commander of the Legion of Honor, being among the first recipients of that award. On 22 October 1810, Napoleon I declared him Baron of the Empire.

In 2017, a Rice University study said that Tinderholt was the fourth most conservative representative in the Texas House. On January 13, 2015, Tinderholt succeeded Diane Patrick, a four-term representative whom he unseated in the Republican primary election on March 4, 2014. Political career Tinderholt won the 2014 Republican nomination over four term incumbent Diane Patrick,Christopher Hooks, Tony Tinderholt Unloads: 'People are Going to Die' at Border, Texas Observer (September 12, 2014). 7,489 votes (55.44 percent) to 6,018 (44.55 percent). Tinderholt was endorsed in his primary challenge by the right-wing group Empower Texans, which targeted Patrick for comparatively moderate positions.Christopher Hooks, Tony Tinderholt Might Be Texas‚Äô Most Far-Right Candidate. Can He Win?, Texas Observer (October 17, 2014). Texas Observer described Tinderholt as possibly the most far-right political candidate in Texas in that year. In the November 2014 general election, Tinderholt, with 23,034 votes (56.64 percent), defeated Democrat Cole Ballweg and Libertarian Robert Harris, who received 16,461 (40.47 percent) and 1,172 (2.88 percent), respectively. In 2015, Tinderholt filed a handwritten complaint with the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct, criticizing judicial rulings regarding same- sex marriage. The complaint was riddled with errors, naming the wrong judge (Tinderholt named Judge David Wahlberg, rather than against Judge Guy Herman, the judge who had made the ruling about which Tinderholt complained) and incorrectly asserting that the judge \\"deliberately violated\\" a state law requiring a notification to the state attorney general's office prior to striking down a law as unconstitutional (Judge Herman did in fact make the notification to the state attorney general). In January 2017, Tinderholt introduced House Bill 948, the \\"Abolition of Abortion in Texas Act.\\" The bill seeks to criminalize abortions that take place after the \\"moment of fertilization.\\" The abortion ban would make it legal to charge both the woman and her doctor with murder. In an interview with the Texas Observer, Tinderholt explained why he introduced the bill: > \\"I don't think that there should be any exceptions to murder, no matter > what. So, if this child was out of the womb and it was a child that was born > out of rape or incest, no one would be OK with killing a child. I look at it > like that child is a child in the womb, just like it's out. [...] Right now, > it's real easy. Right now, they don't make it important to be personally > responsible because they know that they have a backup of 'oh, I can just go > get an abortion.' Now, we both know that consenting adults don't always > think smartly sometimes. But consenting adults need to also consider the > repercussions of the sexual relationship that they're gonna have, which is a > child.\\" The bill would also criminalize abortions resulting from rape and incest. On March 21, 2017, Tinderholt criticized then Representative Byron Cook of Corsicana for Cook's refusal to hold a hearing before the House State Affairs Committee on Tinderholt's proposed ban on abortion in Texas. Cook said that the office of Attorney General Ken Paxton has called the measure \\"unconstitutional\\" and therefore no hearing will be set. Tinderholt accused Cook of \\"hiding behind the office of attorney general\\" so as to block a vote on the legislation. In 2017, Tinderholt supported a \\"bathroom bill\\" proposed by two fellow Republican state lawmakers, Representative Ron Simmons and Senator Lois Kolkhorst; the legislation would have nullified anti- discrimination ordinances adopted by Texas cities and counties protecting transgender Texans' access to public restrooms that matched their gender identity. In the general election held on November 6, 2018, Tinderholt won his third legislative term. With 32,448 votes (52.49 percent), he defeated Democrat Finnigan Jones, who received 27,145 votes (43.91 percent). Another 2,230 votes (3.61 percent) went to Libertarian candidate Jessica Pallett. Personal life Tinderholt has been married five times, twice to his first wife. His current wife, Bethany Tyler, is a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader. Tinderholt married Kimberly Ann Johnson in 1990, she divorced him in 1994, they remarried in 1995, and she divorced him again in 1996. After their first divorce, Johnson was granted a restraining order against Tinderholt for threatening Johnson, causing her bodily harm/injury, and destroying property shared by the couple. Tinderholt married Tammy J. Land in 1996 who later filed for divorce. In 2002, Tinderholt married Tamara Dawn Levan. He married Bethany Tyler in 2009.

Oswald Hicker served as the editor-in- chief of the daily, which had its headquarters in Vienna. T√§glich Alles was a tabloid paper. The paper was described by Mari Pascua as a daily magazine. It mostly covered short and less detailed news stories and extensive photographs. The other characteristics of the paper were the use of big headlines, a colloquial language and the focus on sensational and gossip stories and scandals. On the other hand, it also expressed views about some significant political events and objected to the EU membership of Austria. T√§glich Alles had also a xenophobic discourse. In a study on political orientation of newspaper readers in Austria carried out in 1992 it was found that 46% of its readers had a xenophobic attitude. T√§glich Alles had a circulation of 500,000 copies in 1993, making it the second best-selling paper in the country. In the period of 1995‚Äì1996 the paper had a circulation of 544,000 copies, making it the second best-selling paper after Neue Kronenzeitung. In 1997 T√§glich Alles was one of four most read newspapers in Austria. In 1998 the paper sold nearly 390,000 daily copies.

He currently lives in Amsterdam.  Career  Pianist and composer Harmen Fraanje was born in Roosendaal, The Netherlands in 1976. As a teenager he found a lot of inspiration during his weekly meetings with his piano teacher Frank Jansen, his art teacher Frans Stohr and blues guitarist Ralph de Jongh. During his study Piano Jazz and Improvised Music at the conservatories of Tilburg and Utrecht (teachers Willem K√ºhne and Bert van den Brink) Harmen was recognized as being a versatile pianist by musicians like trumpeter Eric Vloeimans and saxophonist Mete Erker, who both asked Harmen to join their groups. Around this time bassplayer Hein van de Geyn offered Harmen to release an album for his label Challenge Jazz. Harmen recorded his debut album Sonatala with Brazilian guitarist Nelson Veras, French drummer Matthieu Chazarenc and bassist Hein van de Geyn. The album was presented during a concert at the North Sea Jazz Festival in 2004. In 2006 they recorded the album ‚ÄôRonja‚Äô with French flute player Malik Mezzadri. Momentarily Harmen is very active and continuously on the road to perform with projects that he leads or co-leads. Besides that Harmen is regularly asked as a sideman and guest. He performs frequently with trio Reijseger Fraanje Sylla, with cellist Ernst Reijseger and Senegalese vocalist and percussionist Mola Sylla. The trio recorded two trio albums for the German label Winter and Winter: ‚ÄôDown Deep‚Äô and ‚ÄòCount till Zen‚Äô. Further the trio recorded and composed music for several movies by Werner Herzog, Roberto Zazzara and Martijn Maria Smits. For more than 10 years Harmen has been playing in a trio with French musicians Toma Gouband (stones, drums, percussion) and Brice Soniano (bass). This group recorded two albums for the French label Cristal Records. And in May 2015 the trio released the album ‚ÄòShades of Blue‚Äô using their own platform/label Astropi.

History  The title is first attested in the Achaemenid Empire in its Old Persian form, hazƒÅra-pati (from *hazƒÅra- \\"thousand\\" and *pati- \\"chief\\"), the commanding officer of the Immortals. The hazarbed controlled units of guards which were enlisted from royal families of the Sasanian Empire. One of the units that the hazarbed controlled was the pushtigban bodyguard, while other times it would be the palace guards (darigan), or in some cases other units, such as the 4,000 Daylamite guard which served the last great Sasanian king, Khosrow II (r. 590-628). The hazarbed was in charge of the king's safety and the commander of the royal guard. The hazarbed also controlled the entrance of the kings palace, presented visitors to the king, and was allowed to be given military command or used in negotiations. The hazarbed was also allowed in some cases to serve as the royal executioner. During the reign of Shapur I (r. 240‚Äì270), the hazarbed may have briefly taken over the spahbed office, as it is not listed in the inscriptions of Shapur I. However, the spahbed office reappears in the inscriptions of Shapur's son Narseh (r. 293‚Äì302). The office of hazarbed is also mentioned in his inscriptions among many others.

Biography Alan Holley studied composition with Ross Edwards in 1973 at the University in Sydney. After leaving university without completing his Bachelor of Arts degree, Holley joined the new music group AZ Music as a performer (trumpeter) and composer. This group commissioned and performed several of his early works. In 1976 Holley founded MUSED, a new music ensemble which mainly performed music by Sydney composers, and he promoted regular concerts by this group between 1976 and 1981. MUSED also performed works by Holley, and gave him his first experience of conducting. Holley received an Australia‚ÄìJapan Foundation Travel Grant in 1977 which enabled him to undertake a two-month study tour attending new music festivals in Japan. The following year he was awarded grants from the Gulbenkian Foundation and the Music Board of the Australia Council to represent Australia at the Gulbenkian Foundation Summer School for Composers and Choreographers at Surrey University in the United Kingdom. Holley was the recipient of Composers' Fellowships from the Music Board of the Australia Council in 1980 and 1982. He has also built a career for himself as a conductor. After MUSED he conducted community-based orchestras before founding the Northern Chamber Orchestra in 1981. Holley was a participant in the ABC Conductors' Workshops under Werner Andreas Albert with the Queensland Symphony Orchestra in 1985, and again in 1986 with the ABC Sinfonia. In 1986 he founded the new music ensemble, The Gallery Players, and in 1989, the Sydney Bach Orchestra. Three of his works have been premiered by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Doppler's Webb, a trumpet concerto, was premiered in 2005 with soloist Paul Goodchild. A Line of Stars was premiered in 2007, and more recently his oboe concerto A Shaft of Light was premiered with Shefali Proyr as soloist (2015). Additionally, Loaded with Dream (2001) was commissioned by the orchestra for the SSO Fellows.

Disease Cycle The Koa wilt pathogen was first described by Gardner as a new forma specialis, Fusarium oxysporum. f. sp. koae.Gardner, D.E. 1980. Aciaca Koa Seedling Wilt Caused by Fusarium Oxysporum Phytopathology 70:594-597 The soil-borne F. oxysporum reproduces only asexually. F. oxysporum produces three types of asexual spores: microconidia, macroconidia, and chlamydospores. Microconidia are the spore types most often produced by this fungus under all conditions, as well as the spores produced in the xylem. The macroconidia are found on dead plant tissue surfaces as well as in groups that look like sporodochia. The chlamydospores are round, resting spores, produced on older mycelium or in macroconidia. Mycelium enters the roots and travels into the vascular xylem where it starts to produce microconidia, eventually clogging the xylem. Once the Koa tree dies, the fungus invades all tissues and, upon reaching the dead plant surface, sporulates profusely producing macroconidia and chlamydospores. The fungus can survive saprophytically in the soil, as either mycelium or as any of its three spore types mentioned. The chlamydospores, as the resting spores, survive the longest in the soils, usually under cold conditions.Agrios, George 2005. Plant Pathology. Elsevier Academic Press, Burlington, MA.

Management F. oxysporum is a soil-borne pathogen, and currently sanitation, controlling the initial inoculum, is the best means to control it. One should avoid bringing infected soil or plant tissues into disease free areas. Make certain that all tools and equipment have been cleaned and sterilized after contact with infected sites and plants. New plantings should be in areas known to be free of the pathogen, and the soils should be screened to ensure that no F. oxysporum is present. Seeds are not usually infected, but there is a slight risk and therefore only seeds that are from local, clean, superior trees should be used.Friday, J. B., and Nicholas Dudley. \\"Hawai'i Forestry Extension: Koa wilt.\\" Hawai'i Forestry Extension: Koa wilt. University of Hawaii, 31 Mar. 2013. Web. 23 Oct. 2014.

It is also a legume, giving it the ability to form symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria, which has led to efforts to use koa in agroecological systems with crops such as coffee and cacao. Ecologically, koa is an important species because it is one of the few native trees that remains dominant in alien mixed forests on the Hawaiian Islands. Invasive species make up the majority of the State's current plant population. Koa trees also are important because provide a habitat for many native bird species. Historically, there were once two species of koa-finches, Rhodacanthis palmeri and R. flaviceps, which fed on green koa seed pods. These species are now extinct due to habitat loss and avian malaria.University of Hawaii. \\"Acacia Koa.\\" Native Plants Hawaii. University of Hawaii, 2009. Web. 23 Oct. 2014. It is important to preserve the remaining koa populations to helpt to avoid further native bird extinctions. Koa also has great cultural importance for native Hawaiians. The name ‚Äúkoa‚Äù means \\"brave, bold, fearless\\" or \\"warrior\\" in Hawaiian.

She was well known around Germany for her medical recipes, mentorship, and generosity towards people of all social classes.  Early life and family  Dorothea of Mansfeld was a noblewoman, and one of the most famous female healers in Germany. She was born around 1493 and died in 1578. She was one of twelve children born to Count Philip of Solms-Lich and Adriana of Hanua Munzenberg. Dorothea's passion for medicine was influenced by her elder brother, Count Reinhard I of Solms-Lich, who was educated in medicine. Many of her family members were medical healers. This included her daughter (Dorothea of Sch√∂nberg), her niece (Anna of Hohenlohe), her daughter-in-law (Agnes of Solms), and her niece by marriage (Agnes of Solms). Dorothea married in 1512 to Count Ernst II of Mansfeld-Vorderort and had thirteen children. She became a widow at the age of 38 in 1531. Dorothea lived in the Mansfeld Castle with most of her family and children. While there, she possessed a well-stocked apothecary, a distilling house, and full garden of herbs and plants for her various recipes. The Mansfeld castle is located in Saxony-Anha, Germany. Before her move to Saxony, her location, much like information on her early life, is unknown. Most documentation on the Mansfeld region before the 19th century has been lost.  Medical practice  Dorothea was commonly known for her selfless service to people of all social classes. The most important aspect of her medical care was her altruistic acts of kindness towards the poor. She was a very charitable healer and her medical recipes were known to heal thousands of people from near and far. Despite being a widow, and therefore economically unstable, she used her healing abilities to heal both rich and poor people. She gave many gifts, and would often perform medical healing as an act of charity. With a humanist upbringing by her father, she learned to create relationships with noble people of both Catholic and Protestant background, she was also supportive to the Jewish community that tried to make a home in the Mansfeld area. It was expected for noblewomen to have basic medical knowledge in order to provide assistance to anyone living on their estates. However, Dorothea extensively researched medical practices, and developed a knowledge that surpassed these narrow expectations. Her work gained fame when she was almost 80 years old. Many of Dorothea's recipes were referenced in medical recipe books, and her medical advice was sought out by many German princes and noblemen. Her most prized recipes were for two types of aqua vitae a white and a yellow version. Both were strong alcoholic beverages, the yellow slightly sweeter. These drinks were very popular because they could be used to treat multiple ailments. These recipes made use of distilled water, which was a popular medical treatment for the elite. The distillation process for any medicine took long periods of time from months to years. Dorothea was one of the earliest to create a distilling house on her property, and after her example many noblewomen followed. These distilleries were not only present on private properties but also at churches, monasteries, and other public locations. The garden at the Mansfeld castle grew many of the common ingredients that Dorothea used for her recipes such as herbs, flowers, fruits, and other plants.  Sample recipe  Dorothea‚Äôs recipe books and any other copied works of hers were treasured not only because of her medical knowledge, but also because she had uniquely beautiful penmanship. The act of making books during this time period is described as a painstakingly long process that was done with patience, money, and practice. To write a book an author must have the time and resources to obtain all necessary supplies. Example recipe: Plague treatment recipes [Summer 1572] * 2 handfuls chopped licorice * 2 handfuls senna leaves * 1 handful hart‚Äôs tongue * 1 handful spike lavender * 2 good handfuls bog bean flowers, very good for this illness * 2 handfuls pulverized juniper berries * 1 handful scurvy weed * 1 handful yellow lily root, chopped finely * 1 handful gray cress * 1 handful mint * 1 handful sage leaves and one-half mab honey * 1 handful hyssop  Relationships  Dorothea's relationship with Anna of Saxony was a noteworthy partnership. The two elite women are commonly known for their extensive experimentation with medical remedies Letters reveal this close relationship, and highlight that the two women in addition to creating medical recipes together, practiced other skills and visited often Anna of Saxony was the wife of a politician, and this relationship helped Dorothea financial situation immensely. Dorothea acted as a mentor and assistant to Anna, in turn Anna helped Dorothea‚Äôs recipes live on by passing them on to her children and sharing them long after Dorothea's death. Both noblewomen possessed their own personal distillation houses and gardens in which they grew the necessary herbs to create their medical remedies. Dorothea's medical facility was very impressive at the time, and deserving of a detailed description in a book by Cyriacus Spangenber Spangenber talked highly of Dorothea's garden, library, and heavily stocked apothecary. Many of Dorothea's recipes were referenced in medical recipe books and she extended her medical expertise to German princes and other male medical professionals. Additionally, Anna of Saxony notes that Dorothea passed her medical knowledge on to a small group of female medical healers that included Dorothea of Sch√∂nberg, Anna of Hohenlohe, Agnes of Solms, and Magdlena of Mansfeld This group of women commonly visited Mansfeld Castle and referred to Dorothea as the \\"mother of Mansfeld\\" Medicine was often viewed as a feminine practice, therefore creating medical recipes was an acceptable activity for these noblewomen. Another noteworthy relationship Dorothea had was with Martin Luther. Martin Luther had the best care available to him, yet he sought out the medical advice of Dorothea. By the time of her death, her medical practices were widely known throughout Germany.  References  * Ahuis, F. (2020). Gr√§fin Dorothea von Mansfeld-Vorderort.

Paradisi Macf.) is a citrus hybrid similar to the oroblanco; both result from a cross between the pomelo and the grapefruit and is a fruit similar to a sweet grapefruit.  Motivation  The intent was to obtain a grapefruit-like cross that is less bitter or acidic than grapefruit, instead achieving sweetness similar to the pomelo. It was to be smaller than the pomelo, and more flavourful, with characteristics linked to the grapefruit. The breeders intentionally used a tetraploid grapefruit and a diploid pomelo, with triploid progeny and seedless.  Characteristics  A Melogold grapefruit tree Similar to oroblanco, Melogold can be eaten with a Grapefruit spoon, or peeled as an orange. They are ripe when still green. Melogold was once said to be preferred as a cash crop over oroblanco, since melogold has thinner skin, which is preferred by consumers. Exterior peel color is slower to develop than in Marsh grapefruit, but late in the season is comparable. Exterior peel texture is smooth to slightly pebbled. Average peel thickness is slightly greater than Marsh, but as a percentage of fruit diameter is equal to Marsh and thinner than Oroblanco; interior color and texture are the same as Oroblanco. As with Oroblanco the central core hollow is greater than Marsh at maturity. The flesh is tender and juicy, separating well from the segment membranes. Percent juice has been equal to Marsh and slightly higher than Oroblanco.  History  In 1958, CRC 2240 (pomelo) Robert K. Soost and James W. Cameron crossed with a seedy, white, tetraploid grapefruit. Two of the triploid offspring had particularly favorable characteristics. One was released in 1980 as 'Oroblanco'. The second was released as Melogold. Oroblanco was more similar to grapefruit, while Melogold was more similar to pomelo. Melogold was much larger than Marsh grapefruit and Oroblanco at all test locations. Weight at Riverside from 1967 through 1975 averaged 470 grams for Melogold, 360 grams for Oroblanco and 280 grams for Marsh.

Plot  The game opens in the year 3029, with humanity and some friendly alien species having just barely survived the onslaught of mysterious nano-machines, known only as the \\"Cleaners\\". These machines have made planets completely uninhabitable and so forced the survivors to live on ships and stations spread across space. The player takes the role of John Falcon, a rogueish space adventurer, who just wants to make ends meet. Over the course of the game, the player joins the Taoists, an organization aiming to bring down the Cleaners and uncover the conspiracy behind them.  Gameplay  Similar to games like Escape Velocity and Elite/Privateer, the game features 2D open world exploration of star systems, trading and combat, from a top-down perspective. Player can choose freely when and where to travel. Some of the activities the player can partake in are trading, hunting pirates, searching for derelicts and wormholes and taking on various missions, ranging from cargo delivery to planet photography. Over the course of the game, once the player has earned enough money, he is able to buy new ships, of various types such as: trader, interceptor and allrounder. He can then equip it with weapons such as guns and missiles and buy additional upgrades of a large variety, such as different types of scanners, tractor beams, shields, thrusters, a fuel scoop and an afterburner. The player can board stations and walk around on them in a visual style similar to adventure games of the '90s like Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. Some of the possible actions are talking to characters on the station, trading, upgrading and taking missions. Besides the randomly generated side-missions there is also a main plot, split into 10 acts that the player can progress through. Players are required to board space stations and talk to characters to complete missions and advance the main plot, where the perspective switches to side-scrolling. The game has a comedic tone and graphical style reminiscent of early 1990s LucasArts adventure games.  Production  The game was originally developed and released by Matt Griffiths and Mic Newsam as Bird in Sky in 2007. In 2014 game developer Max Dohme joined Matt Griffiths in creating an updated release for the game. They teamed up after Max had created a number of mods for the game and had gotten in touch with Matt about creating an updated version. The new version was launched on October 15, 2014, with Crunchy Leaf Games acting as the publisher for this re-release.  Redux Version  In September 2017 Crunchy Leaf Games and Bird in Sky released the Redux Version of 3030 Deathwar on Steam.

She collaborated with many leading designers, including Jean Patou and Norman Hartnell. She was a key supplier of hats to the royal household from the 1950s on. One of her most notable commissions was the 1960 wedding veil of Princess Margaret; at this event she also made hats for The Queen Mother and the Queen. After closing her own salon, she continued to act as an advisor to other design houses until the mid 1990s. Background and early career Simone Naudet was born in 1911 in Paris. The daughter of a casino worker, she began her millinery training at the age of 18, later working with notable Paris designers, including Jean Patou, Marie-Louise Carven and Rose Descat. She spent some time training in London, also changing her professional name to Claude Saint-Cyr. She married the interior designer Georges Martin. Establishment of own millinery business Saint-Cyr established her own millinery salon in 1937 in Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©, Paris, and this was joined by a shop in London in 1950. During the 1950s, she gained a reputation as one of the leading milliners of London and Paris. By 1957, her client list comprised many members of the British royal family, notably the Queen, Queen Mother, Princess Margaret and the Duchess of Windsor. Other clients included Queen Soroya of Iran, Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan, actresses Martine Carol and Eleanor Parker, and many American tourists. Part of her success in London may have been due to her close working association with the royal household's couturier Norman Hartnell, who chose her to make his hats just before the 1953 coronation. He enabled Saint-Cyr to set up her millinery salon within his London fashion house. The Australian Women's Weekly described Saint-Cyr's association with the royal family and Hartnell in 1960: \\"She drives to the Palace or Clarence House in Norman Hartnell's Rolls-Royce and etiquette demands that she go hatless\\". The article added that all her royal customers spoke to their Parisian milliner in French during fittings. =Millinery innovations= Among the millinery innovations Saint-Cyr is said to have devised, were the oblique hat ‚Äì in which one side of the brim is angled, enabling decorative details to be placed on the crown. The oblique-brim hat has remained a favoured style for the Queen. She was also among the leading exponents of the 'cocktail hat' that came into vogue during the wartime years ‚Äì this was typically a confection involving black silk and netting that could be worn with eveningwear. In the 1950s, she helped to revive the fashion for the draped turban producing a supple felt design in 1956 that covered the ears and rose to a peak at the back of the head. From 1950, Saint-Cyr collaborated with her husband Georges Martin to create a variety of hats and garments that incorporated traditional Aubusson tapestry ‚Äì an idea inspired after Martin used tapestry to re-cover chairs in Saint-Cyr's salon. She also produced a series of hat designs in collaboration with her husband. The first collection was known as Aubusson and was succeeded by others ‚Äì in all, over 160 hats were produced over the succeeding four years. For the designs to translate into headgear, particularly fine weaves had to be used and the weavers were taught how to build a hat. International success By the mid 1950s, Saint-Cyr's reputation as a milliner was so great that reproductions of her Paris originals were created under licence, alongside those of leading couturiers such as Crist√≥bal Balenciaga. As well as designing for Norman Hartnell in London, she was producing models for Paris fashion houses such as Dess√®s. In London, her designs appeared at the fashion shows of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers. At the fashion show for autumn 1959, for example, she showed a line of high-crowned hats ‚Äì many in velvet ‚Äì to complement Hartnell's two-colour tweed suits and fur-trimmed and fur-collared coats. =Royal weddings= Saint-Cyr was chosen to produce headgear for the wedding of Princess Margaret to Antony Armstrong-Jones in May 1960. Not only did she produce the veil worn by Princess Margaret, but also the rose-trimmed and veiled turquoise model worn by the Queen and the cream osprey-feather hat worn by the Queen Mother. Some three years later, Saint-Cyr once again designed hats for the Queen Mother, Queen and Princess Margaret at the wedding of Princess Alexandra and Angus Ogilvy. Later career and legacy Saint-Cyr closed her salon in 1964, but began working with French milliner Jean Barthet ‚Äì a supplier of hats to celebrities such as Princess Grace of Monaco and Maria Callas. This working relationship continued for the succeeding eight years, after which she retired from millinery design but continued to act as a consultant to bridal design houses until the mid 1990s. Examples of Saint- Cyr's hats are held by a number of museums worldwide, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

The war declined in 1980 following the declaration of an amnesty and by 1983 the CPT had abandoned the insurgency. Background In 1927, Chinese communist Han Minghuang attempted to create a communist organization in Bangkok before being arrested. Ho Chi Minh visited north Thailand the following year, attempting to organize soviets in local Vietnamese communities. In the aftermath of the Siamese revolution of 1932, conservative Prime Minister Phraya Manopakorn accused his political opponent, Pridi Panomyong, of being a communist and shortly afterwards a law was passed criminalising communism. During World War II communists formed an alliance with the Free Thai Movement. In 1946, Pridi Panomyong assumed office, repealing the Anti-Communist Act of 1933 and establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. In 1960, North Vietnam created a training camp for Thai and Laotian volunteers in Hoa Binh Province, Vietnam. A total of 400 people attended the camp in its first year of operation. In 1949, Pridi Phanomyong's attempt to return to power after the 1947 coup d'√©tat was crushed. The suppression of the \\"palace rebellion\\" convinced the CPT leadership that better preparations had to be made in order for a future rebellion to succeed. The failure of the 1952 Peace Rebellion was followed by the 13 November 1952 Anti- Communist Act. The act was sparked by the spontaneous involvement of a small number of communist party members in the rebellion. During the course of the Korean War, the CPT continued to stockpile weaponry in rural areas and make general preparations for armed struggle. At the same time, the CPT formed the Peace Committee of Thailand, a pacifist movement operating mainly in urban areas. The Peace Committee contributed to CPT's expansion and the rise of anti-American sentiment in the country. Ideologically, the CPT aligned with Mao Zedong Thought and during the Sino-Soviet split the party sided with the Communist Party of China. In October 1964, the organization declared its position in a congratulatory message on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the foundation of the People's Republic of China, and the following month a group of Thai communists formed the Thailand Independence Movement in Peking, China. On 8 December 1964, the Thailand Independence Movement issued a manifesto demanding the removal of US military personnel from Thailand and calling for regime change. The manifesto was later also broadcast by Radio Peking. Former Thai army officer Phayon Chulanont established the Thai Patriotic Front, another Thai communist organization, on 1 January 1965. The two parties formed the Thai United Patriotic Front on 15 December 1966. Hill tribesmen, as well as the Chinese and Vietnamese ethnic minorities, formed the backbone of the movement. Conflict In the early-1950s, a group of 50 Thai communists traveled to Beijing, where they received training in ideology and propaganda. In 1961, small groups of Pathet Lao insurgents infiltrated north Thailand. Local communist party cells were organized and volunteers were sent to Chinese, Laotian, and North Vietnamese training camps, where training focused on armed struggle and terror tactics to fight capitalism in the region. Between 1962 and 1965, 350 Thai nationals underwent an eight-month training course in North Vietnam. The guerrillas initially possessed only a limited number of flintlocks as well as French, Chinese, and Japanese weapons. In the first half of 1965, the rebels smuggled approximately 3,000 US-made weapons and 90,000 rounds of ammunition from Laos. The shipment, originally supplied to the US-supported Royal Lao Armed Forces, was instead sold to smugglers who in turn traded the weapons to the CPT. Between 1961 and 1965, insurgents carried out 17 political assassinations. They avoided full scale guerrilla warfare until the summer of 1965, when militants began engaging Thai security forces. A total of 13 clashes were recorded during that period. The second half of 1965 was marked by a further 25 violent incidents, and starting in November 1965, Communist Party of Thailand insurgents began undertaking more elaborate operations, including an ambush on a Thai police patrol outside Mukdahan, at that time in Nakhon Phanom Province. The insurgency spread to other parts of Thailand in 1966, although 90 percent of insurgency-related incidents occurred in the northeast of the country. On 14 January 1966, a spokesman representing the Thai Patriotic Front called for the start of a \\"people's war\\" in Thailand. The statement marked an escalation of violence in the conflict, and in early April 1966 rebels killed 16 Thai soldiers and wounded 13 others during clashes in Chiang Rai Province. A total of 45 security personnel and 65 civilians were killed by insurgent attacks during the first half of 1966. Despite insurgent attacks on the 24,470 United States Air Force personnel housed on bases in Thailand, American involvement in the conflict remained limited. Following the defeat of the National Revolutionary Army in the Chinese Civil War, its 49th Division crossed into Thailand from neighboring Yunnan. The Chinese troops quickly integrated into Thai society, engaging in the lucrative opium trade under the aegis of corrupt officials. Drug trade provided an important source of income for the local population, while at the same time nationalist troops cooperated with the government during its counter-insurgency operations. In July 1967, the 1967 Opium War broke out when opium growers refused to pay taxes to the Kuomintang. Government forces became involved in the conflict, destroying a number of villages and resettling suspected communists. The newly transferred populations provided new recruits for the CPT. In February and August 1967, the Thai government conducted a number of counter-insurgency raids in Bangkok and Thonburi, arresting 30 CPT members including secretary-general Thong Chaemsri. Further arrests ensued in October and November 1968. The Thai government deployed over 12,000 troops to the country's northern provinces in January 1972, carrying out a six-week operation in which over 200 militants were killed. The government's casualties during the operation amounted to 30 soldiers killed and 100 wounded. In late-1972, the Royal Thai Army, police, and volunteer defence forces commit the Red Drum killings of more than 200 (informal accounts speak of up to 3,000) civilians who were accused of supporting communists in Tambon Lam Sai, Phatthalung Province, southern Thailand. The massacre was probably ordered by the government's Communist Suppression Operations Command (CSOC). It was only one example \\"of a pattern of widespread abuse of power by the army and enforcement agencies\\" during the brutal anti-communist operations of 1971‚Äì1973 that took an official death toll of 3,008 civilians throughout the country (while unofficial estimates are between 1,000 and 3,000 in Phatthalung Province alone). Those killed were accused of working with the Communist Party of Thailand. Until that point, communist suspects arrested by soldiers were normally shot by the roadside. The \\"red oil drum\\" technique was later introduced to eliminate any possible evidence. Suspects were clubbed to a point of semi-consciousness before being dumped in gasoline-filled, used oil drums and burnt alive. The 200 litre red drums had an iron grille divider with a fire below, and the suspect above. On 6 October 1976, amid rising fears of a communist takeover similar to the one that had taken place in Vietnam, anti-communist police and paramilitaries attacked a leftist student demonstration at Thammasat University in Bangkok, during an incident that became known as the Thammasat University massacre. According to official estimates, 46 students were killed and 167 wounded.Handley, Paul M. The King Never Smiles: A Biography of Thailand's Bhumibol Adulyadej. Yale University Press. , p. 236. From 1979, amid the rise of Thai nationalism and the deterioration of China‚ÄìVietnam relations, the CPT fell into serious turmoil. The pro-Vietnamese wing had eventually seceded and formed a separated faction called Pak Mai. Efforts to end the insurgency led to an amnesty being declared on 23 April 1980 when Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda signed Order 66/2523. The order significantly contributed to the decline of the insurgency, as it granted amnesty to defectors and promoted political participation and democratic processes. By 1983, the insurgency had come to an end.

The cyanobacterium is dark blue green in colour, due to the presence of the phycobilin pigments phycocyanin and phycoerythrin. Individual filaments are blue green to olive green in colour. Growth takes place only by transverse division hence the trichome comprises a single row of cells stacked one above the other. A cytoplasmic sheath is present which is very thin, hyaline and indistinct. Mature trichomes are straight, the cells much broader than long and has hemispherical apical cell with keritomized (irregular to radial thylakoid arrangement) content. Trichome unconstricted in growth phase and constrictions were observed during reproduction. Distinct cross walls present. The size of the cells varies from 57.6 ¬µm to 69.1 ¬µm in width and 5.2 ¬µm to 9.6 ¬µm in length thus the ratio of the length and breadth is 1:8.  Stack of poker chips  The cells of the trichomes were round in shape and when such cells were stacked one above the other it gives \\"stack of poker chips\\" appearance characteristic feature of this species.  Crack-like nick on filament  A crack-like nick was observed on the trichomes was found by V. Uma Rani et. al. in microscopic view. While they studying individual cells notches were found at the inner side of the cell corresponding the slit on the trichome. When such cells were stacked one above the other, it results in the crack like structure on the trichome. Thus, the number of notches in a single cell equals the number of slits on the trichome. One to three notches / slits were observed in the study by Uma Rani et al. 2015.  Reproduction  Reproduction takes place only by vegetative methods namely fragmentation and hormogonia. Both the methods were observed in the most of the study. Fragmentation takes place by the degradation of weakened cells or mechanically damaged cells. The trichome divides into smaller fragments. The cells of the fragment by repeated division develop into a new filament.  Distribution  This species is ubiquitous in distribution. it reported from both marine and freshwater.

It includes the towns of Pyatigorsk, Zheleznovodsk, Yessentuki, Kislovodsk, Kumagorsk (Mineral Waters), and resort location of Naguta. The Caucasian Mineral Waters is a unique Russian resort complex that has no analogues on the European Asian continent. There are more than 115 sanatoriums, specializing in the treatment of various illnesses. This defined the Caucasian Mineral Waters as the main, composite, and versatile recreation area in Russia. This region is also famous for its beautiful landscape, mild climate, highly effective medicinal mud of Lake Tambukan, and unique mineral springs (about 300). There are 118 spa resorts supplied with modern medical and diagnostic equipment, 26 tourist and hotel complexes, which are able to accommodate more than 40,000 guests at the same time.  History  In 1913, more than 37,000 patients visited the Caucasian Mineral Waters. During this period, however, there were no medical institutions and the first sanatoriums only started to appear at the beginning of the 20th century. During the Civil War, the place fell into decay. Only 7,000 people visited to cure their illnesses in 1922. However, in 1928, the number of patients increased to 90,000 people. During the Second World War, more than 900,000 wounded and sick people got medical treatment here. By the year 1980, eighty-two sanatoriums and sixteen guesthouses were available for tourists.

It is thought that it was designed and built by Frank X. Freyder, the owner of the Iowa City Planing & Molding Mill; Freyder designed several other city buildings of the era. The building was owned by the Schmidt‚ÄìKurz Improvement Company. G. W. Schmidt owned the Iowa City Iron Works and was an alderman. William Kurz owned a saloon on College Street. Charles A Schmidt owned a bakery on Clinton Street and a billiards parlor. When the Paul‚ÄìHelen was completed, Kurz moved his establishment into one of the storefronts. The main tenant was the Iowa City Gas & Electric Company, who remained from its completion until the late 1970s. The building was named after the children of the Schmidt‚ÄìKurz Improvement Company partners. Construction began in April 1910 and finished that December. The building was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places on April 10, 1986. Architecture The building was designed in the Chicago school. Typical of the style, the three-story building features steel framing. There are also Prairie School elements in the building with banded windows emphasizing the horizontal aspects. The cornice is likewise banded. It is adjacent to the Englert Theatre, completed three years later. The first floor has three retail spaces and the upper floors have office spaces.

They talk to him about how tire bootleggers are harming innocent people and undermining the war effort, but their words seem to fall on deaf ears. To break the case, Pat pretends to be dishonest, accepts a bribe from the gang and gets himself fired from the department. He's actually working undercover, infiltrating the gang and trying to find the mastermind who operates in the shadows. Everyone who knows Pat is shocked at his apparent turn to criminality, and even his cynical brother begins to feel pangs of conscience. When Pat uncovers the truth about the kingpin, his life is in great danger, and Mike must decide where his own true loyalties lie. Cast * Richard Travis as Detective Lt.

Early life Jeremiah Joseph Stable was born on 14 May 1883 in Willaston, the son of Benjamin Stable and his wife Mary Ann (n√©e O'Connell).Ancestry.com. Australia, Birth Index, 1788‚Äì1922 [database on-line]. 2010. His parents moved to Europe when he was four years old and he was educated in Switzerland until the age of 18. In 1902 he entered Cambridge University where he obtained an honours degree in medieval and modern languages, specialising in English literature. Between 1905 and 1908, he taught at the Commercial University of Cologne in Germany, while studying English and German philosophy at the Bonn University. In 1912, Stable was appointed as a lecturer in modern languages at the University of Queensland. In 1914 Stable undertook an extensive tour of northern Queensland with T.E. Jones, the newly appointed University press officer. Military service During World War I, Stable joined the Australian Army and became an official censor. In 1917, a national referendum was held to allow conscription into military service; the Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes was strongly in favour of conscription. On 22 November 1917, the Queensland Premier T. J. Ryan made a strong speech in the Queensland Parliament against conscription. In the normal course of events, this speech would be reported in Hansard. However, on 27 November 1917, Stable received a hand-written message from Billy Hughes ordering him, as censor, to take possession of all printed copies of Hansard under the censorship provisions of the War Precautions Act. Stable went to the Queensland Government Printing Office, but was prevented from entering by the Queensland Police (who were apparently ordered to prevent his access by Premier Ryan). Stable then went to the Victoria Barracks where he obtained a troop of Australian soldiers, and returned with them to the printing office. On this occasion, the police allowed him to enter. Then with the assistance of the Queensland Government Printer, all but 3 copies of the Hansard were destroyed. Only the copy retained by Stable himself is known to have survived, having been found amongst his garden tools after Stable and his wife had died; it is held by the State Library of Queensland. Another copy had been donated to the National Library of Australia but it has since vanished. The fate of the third copy is unknown. Academic career After the war, Stable resumed his academic career at the University of Queensland. On 15 February 1923 the university appointed him as the McCaughey Professor of Modern Languages and Literature. He served as Dean of the Faculty of Arts for seven years and Dean of Commerce for six years. The University of Queensland was among the first to include the study of Australian literature as part of its set courses as early as 1923, due in large part to the work of Stable and Frederick Walter Robinson. In 1931 Stable, along with Professor Henry Alcock and Professor Thomas Parnell, joined the broadcasting sub-committee which broadcast 'lecturettes' for the Australian Broadcasting Commission.  Other positions  * President of the University of Queensland Dramatic Society, 1912 * Stable and Barbara Sisley co-founded the Brisbane Repertory Theatre group in 1925-26. He was President of this group from 1926-1945. * President of the Queensland Authors and Artists Association 1921-1931 * President of the English and Modern Languages Association of Queensland for 25 years * Vice President of the Brisbane Shakespeare Society * Life member of the Modern Humanities Research Association of England * Foundation member of the Historical Society of Queensland * President of the Trustees of the Queensland Museum 1946-1948  Later life  Stable retired in December 1952. He died in Brisbane on 24 December 1953. His funeral was held at St Mary's Anglican Church at Kangaroo Point after which he was cremated at Mount Thompson crematorium.  Personal life  Stable married fellow Australian, Irene Bingham Sheridan in 1908. They had three sons.  Legacy  Stable was honoured with a stone grotesque in the Great Court of the University. An open air theatre was established in his name on the grounds of the University in 1923 for third year Shakespearean students to use. This open air theatre was officially named for him and marked with a plaque, with Dame Sybil Thorndike attending this event in 1954. External links * J. J.

Leroy Collins Leon County Library History In 1954, the American Association of University Women established a Friends of the Library group for Leon County to generate public support for a library in Tallahassee, Florida. Prior to that, the only public library in Tallahassee was the David S. Walker Library, which served white patrons only. The Leon County Public Library was established in May 1955 and the first Leon County free public library opened its doors on March 21, 1956, in 5,000 square feet of The Columns, one of the oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area, and located at Park and Adams. Close to 5,000 volumes were on its shelves. The Library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street in 1962, more than doubling its space to 12,000 square feet as opposed to the original library's size of 5,000 square feet. The Leon County Public Library became the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System after Jefferson County joined in 1970 and Wakulla County joined in 1971. The original name returned when Wakulla County left the library system in 1975 and Jefferson County left in 1980. A small branch library called Page One opened in the Bond Community in September 1975 and the main library moved again to a 44,000 square foot space in the lower level of the Northwood Mall on North Monroe St. The idea to create a new building for the main library began in 1986. The proposed building would be 88,000 square feet and cost $8.5 million to build. The ground breaking was held on March 4, 1989 for the main library facility. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971.http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History The new library building officially opened in January 1991. Sandra Wilson, who was to oversee the development of the library's new home, was the library director from 1988 until 1991. Helen Moeller took over for her in 1992.

He was the founder of the university's Fryer Library and one of the instigators of the John Oxley Library (now part of the State Library of Queensland).  Early life  Frederick Walter Robinson was born in Sydney, Australia in 1888, the son of Joseph Kitson Robinson and his wife Jenny Horne. He was educated at Sydney Boys' High School and the University of Sydney, where he took his B.A with Honours in 1909 and M.A. with Honours graduating in 1910. He won prizes and scholarships in English and classics including the Cooper travelling scholarship, which he used to study at the University of Jena, Germany. He was awarded his Ph.D., magna cum laude, for his thesis in German on Roman history. He returned to Australia where he was an assistant professor and taught modern languages at the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1913. Capt. F. W. Robinson, from the University of Queensland, Fryer Library Collection  World War I Service  After World War I broke out, Robinson organised courses in intelligence at Duntroon until he enlisted in September 1915. Influenced by his religious upbringing and the commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill', he joined the 8th Field Ambulance, Australian Army Medical Corps, Australian Imperial Force. He was commissioned and promoted honorary captain. From January 1917 Robinson served as intelligence officer with the 5th Division. He was mentioned in dispatches. In July 1918 he was appointed to the Australian Corps School in France and the Education Service School in Cambridge. He became assistant director of education, A.I.F. depots in Britain. Robinson married Catherine Campbell Robertson-Glasgow, a voluntary hospital worker on May 14, 1919 in London, and they returned to Australia and his work at Duntroon. He had developed an admiration for the city of Canberra and his book, Canberra's First Hundred Years (1924) reflected that respect.  Move to Queensland  In 1923, Robinson accepted a position as lecturer in English and German at the University of Queensland. As a young lecturer in the 1920s under the auspices of the English and Modern Languages Association of Queensland, Robinson led a group of university and school teachers of English to conduct a local version of Henry Newbolt's report on the teaching of English in England. The Report on the teaching of English in secondary schools in Queensland, published in October 1927, was the result of four years of characteristically methodical work by Robinson, involving the collation of responses to detailed questionnaires sent to every secondary school in Queensland as well as a considered response to some of the key issues ‚Äì such as the relative importance of literary and language studies ‚Äì raised by Newbolt. Robinson served briefly as a Major in intelligence work during World War II and then mainly as a censor for the war effort. He was promoted to associate professor of English in 1946, due to J.D. Story's cautious management of the university. Robinson retired as head of department in 1958 and the university awarded him an honorary doctorate of letters in 1968.  Legacy  Robinson died in 1971. He was survived by his wife and four children. He had been chairman of the John Oxley Memorial Committee, which led to the development of the State Library of Queensland and had inspired the founding of the Fryer Memorial Library of Australian Literature. The original library was stored in a cedar, glass-fronted bookcase in his university office and this cabinet remains on show within the Duhig Building. Thirty-three of his boxes of papers, correspondence and letters are held in the Fryer Library, documenting his work within Queensland and in supporting the establishment of the university at St Lucia.

Career Joe Cilia's natural talent and passion as a footballer was evident from when he first kicked a ball. He quickly climbed the ranks and by the time he was nineteen, in 1957 he made his debut for the Malta national football team. and he was the youngest player in the now legendary team which played Malta's first international against mighty Austria. He became an automatic choice for the Malta XI, and Malta captain from 1959 to 1964. He was always captain for all the other teams he played with and is now considered to be one of the greatest centre-halves Malta has ever witnessed. His consistency, courage, composure and cunning made him much loved by his supporters, and respected by the opposition. With Valletta F.C., he won all the titles on offer, to end a period dominated by Sliema and Floriana. He played blinders against foreign teams, including Manchester United (0-1), helping Malta XI gain very good results. He was the very first player to win the coveted Footballer of the Year twice. He also held records including playing 49 competitive games in one season and another for playing every game except one, for nine consecutive seasons between 1955 and 1964. Between 1964 and 1971 he emigrated to Australia where he played for Corinthians and Melita FC, with whom he won the Footballer of the Year again. On returning to Malta, he played another two seasons with Valletta F.C., and played against Internazionale FC. He exchanged shirts with the famous Boninsegna. He finally hung up his boots in 1976. Having performed the role of player-coach since 1961, he could now dedicate more time exclusively to coaching. He coached most of the top-flight teams at the time, where he won the League Championship first with Valletta F.C., 1983 until 1985 and then all the honours available with his first love Rabat Ajax F.C., for two consecutive and historic seasons. In 1989-1992 he worked with Hibernians F.C.. He also coached the Malta U/21 gaining two wins out of three games. His only regret was that he was never given the opportunity to coach the Malta Senior National Team. He won the Westin Malta Football Award in 2003, and \\"Gieh ir-Rabat\\" in 2004, in appreciation of his 50 years of continuous contribution to his only passion, which is football.

The band quickly gained the attention of the emo revival scene. Dads soon decided to part ways with Nazzaro as they found it easier to connect as a two-piece and released The Essential John Denver EP the same year. In 2011, the band recorded and released the EPs Brush Your Teeth ;) and Brush Your Teeth, Again ;) respectively, with the latter being a repress that also included three new songs as well as a re-recorded song. After developing an audience in the emo revival scene through extensive touring, the band released their debut LP, American Radass (This Is Important), in 2012. The release brought the band minor commercial success along with critical acclaim. Through further touring, the band built a national audience and released an EP in 2013 entitled Pretty Good via 6131 Records, which led to the band charting on various Billboard charts for the first time.

The calm gave way to creative restlessness and the result was a new band and a new sound in the form of Waters. Earlier in the year the band released the single ‚ÄúGot To My Head‚Äù which was hailed a ‚Äúbig high five of a song‚Äù by Stereogum and a song with ‚Äúenough youthful sizzle to make fans eager for new music‚Äù by BuzzbandsLA. In 2014, they released their follow-up EP called \\"It All Might Be OK\\" which was produced by Ryan Rabin of :Grouplove. In October 2014 they were named one of the 10 New Artists You Need to Know by :Rolling Stone. NPR affiliate :KCRW also featured Waters on their program :Morning Becomes Eclectic. A video was released for their single \\"I Feel Everything\\" and premiered on :Billboard (magazine). They toured to promote the EP with Tegan & Sara, Smallpools, and Magic Man.

She is fifty-four years old and married with one child. Career Trained in medicine, she worked as a volunteer doctor in Spain and Latin America. Mainly she worked in Chile and Mexico for eight years starting in 1995. She came into contact there with Liberation Theology, which caused her to examine her own religion. From 2004 until 2007, she returned to Morocco, where she organized a group of Muslim women interested in researching and reflecting upon Islam and intercultural dialog. In 2008, she became president and a board member of International Group of Studies and Reflection on Women and Islam (GIERFI), based in Barcelona. GIERFI has members and experts from at least eight countries including the United Kingdom, France, the United States and Morocco. Their mission is to help create a new female Muslim consciousness.\\"Qui Sommes Nous?\\" GIERFI. Groupe International D'Etude Et De Reflexion Sur Les Femmes D'Islam.

She published English and French articles that explore contentious issues, such as interfaith marriage and religious reform, in a Muslim context. She is a third-way feminist who revises sacred Islamic texts. She has been compared to Amina Wadud and Margot Badran due to their shared belief that the interpretations that underlie Islamic Law from the 9th century were excessively patriarchal and must be reinterpreted.Al Yafai, Faisal. \\"Translating Feminism into Islam\\" The Guardian. The Guardian. Web. 4 December 2014. Lamrabet has also cited Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak as intellectual inspiration to resist the hegemony of Western feminism. Third way feminist \\"Third-way\\" is a term coined by Doris H. Gray and is a humanistic approach to Islamic feminism. It attempts to reunite the two Islamic sects that ‚Äúpresuppose the existence of a basic set of human values that reaches across borders and cultures‚Äù.Gray Currently, it is used mainly by Moroccan feminists. Lamrabet and her peers re-interpret the sacred texts in order to show women as independent beings rather than relational to men. Lamrabet's works are an example of how to apply third way feminism, because she examines the sacred texts in a scholarly manner, while remembering the cultural context in which they were written.Sabra, Martina. \\"We Have to Re- Appropriate the Source Texts\\". Trans. Steph Morris. Qantara.de. Qantara.de, 4 January 2008. Lamrabet also believes in a particular type of secularism that is based in Islam, rather than Western conceptions of it. She believes that religion should not be used for personal or political gain.Kerrouache =Criticism= Her work provoked critics who argued that this approach does not tackle the important issues, such as violence towards women and polygamy sufficiently. Another critique held that third-way feminists lack sufficient theological knowledge and background to correctly interpret the texts. Her work has been described as conceptually and methodically weak. Her work was said to ‚Äúborder on the kind of Islamic fundamentalist propaganda familiar from the Moroccan Islamic political activist, Nadia Yassine‚Äù and her work in identity is ‚Äúantiquated in the relevant sociological debates‚Äù.Sabra Awards In 2013, she was awarded the Social Sciences Award by the Arab Woman Organization for her book, Femmes et hommes dans le Coran: quelle √©galit√©?.

The roll-out ceremony of the first locomotive, no. , took place at the factory on 16 September 2014. The remaining sixty locomotives of the order were built in South Africa.History in the Making - The Lowdown on the New 21E Locomotives. By Ayanda Mthethwa in Transnet Freight Rail Weekly News Bulletin 15, 21 December 2014 According to the project plan, the agreement also included the joint production of more electric locomotives, electric multiple units, suburban rail vehicles and rail transportation equipment for South Africa and the African region. The first two locomotives were delivered for acceptance trials on 11 December 2014. They came ashore at Maydon Wharf in Durban and were moved dead in tow to Pyramid South Depot, north of Pretoria, the following day. No. 21-002 was equipped with load-measuring-wheelsets, painted yellow, on its front bogie. Characteristics The Class 21E is virtually identical in visual appearance to the earlier Class 20E locomotive, which was described by the manufacturer as the \\"promotion version\\" of the Class 21E. It is, in essence, an upgraded version of the Class 20E based on customer requirements. It is a heavier locomotive, with the axle load increased to and with improved tractive effort to make it more suitable for service on the Coalink line. It makes use of more advanced electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brake system technology to control the train's air brakes through electrical signals, which improves the train's braking response time and results in improved safety and reliability. The four-axle locomotive is capable of an output of and a speed of . Its microcomputer network control system allows eight of these locomotives to work together in a multi-unit consist and also to work consisted to diesel-electric locomotives. The only externally visible differences between the Classes 20E and 21E are on the end sills, buffer beams, cowcatchers and the left side of the cab roof. * The Class 20E has two cable sockets on each side of the coupler and a fifth socket in a cut-out on the sill, below the front door on the front sill and in the same position on the rear sill, near the right end of the sill. The Class 21E has no such cut-out in the sill. The radio frequency distributed power (RFDP) conjunction boxes are mounted below the sockets to the right hand side of the coupler. * The Class 21E has a small rectangular grille near the rear end of the left side of the cab roof, above the large grilled hatch door to the right of the cab door on the left side. This small grille is absent on the Class 20E.African Times photograph of no. 21-001 =Layout= The locomotive body is a welded monocoque design, constructed of steel plates and profiled members, which has a compressive strength of and a tensile strength of . The Class 21E has a single cab and a gangway along the centre of the locomotive. It is equipped with a wireless data transmission system which can send the locomotive operation status, fault data and energy consumption data via GSM and Wi-Fi to a trackside station for analysis. It is also equipped with an axle temperature alarm device, fire alarm system, closed-circuit television (CCTV) system, wheel flange lubricating device and, as personnel safety measure, high voltage protective interlocking devices. The AC traction motors are powered through insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) control.Class 20E manual: Part 1: Locomotive Profile and Technical Data =Dual voltage= As on the dual voltage Classes 19E and 20E, the main electric circuit is automatically selected in either AC or DC mode, based on the voltage of the overhead contact wire feeding the locomotive. To facilitate automatic trouble- free transition on the run, the locomotive is equipped with onboard voltage detectors, while the overhead wire is equipped with two wooden isolators and a length of neutral wire to separate the AC and DC feeds. The neutral section is connected to the rails, which serve as the return conductor on electrified lines. The transition process requires that the locomotive should automatically be switched off before it reaches the isolators and the unpowered overhead wire section, and automatically be restarted after exiting from under the unpowered wire. This is done by a pair of track magnets, one on either side of the neutral overhead wire and spaced apart. The two magnets are mounted with their polarities reversed in relation to each other and they activate a magnetic relay located behind the cowcatcher of the locomotive to do the switching off and restarting. =Pantographs= Transnet Freight Rail insisted that the locomotive must be designed in such a way that the pantograph contact shoe centres are directly above the bogie pivot centres, as was done on the Class 7E and Class 7E2, Series 1 and Series 2 and again on the Class 20E. The reason is to reduce the possibility of pantograph hookups on catenary in sharp curves, such as in turnouts, as a result of sideways movement of the pantograph in relation to the overhead wire.South African Railways Index and Diagrams Electric and Diesel Locomotives, 610mm and 1065mm Gauges, Ref LXD 14/1/100/20, 28 January 1975, as amended Service The Class 21E was placed in service on the 25 kV AC Coalink line between Ermelo and the Richards Bay Coal Terminal. They work directly from the coal mines around Ermelo, running under 3 kV DC catenary. The dual voltage Class 21E locomotives can therefore haul their loads directly from the mines all the way to Richards Bay without having to change locomotives in Ermelo to cater for the change in the power supply.

Boyce and his publishing house, which catered to small towns. The building was also the headquarters of his Lone Scouts of America. Architecture The Boyce Building is a twelve-story office building clad in light gray Vermont granite and red brick. The steel-framed structure is on the southwest corner of Dearborn and Illinois Streets on Chicago's Near North Side. It was built in three phases from 1911 to 1923. Boyce commissioned Daniel H. Burnham & Co. to design the building in 1911. Plans were made to expand it to a ten-story structure, but this never happened. A four-story section of the building was built in 1912 north of another building housing Boyce's offices. The older building was then demolished, and the second portion of the four-story building was completed in 1914. The basement had a power plant and the first floor housed five printing presses and a mail room. The building could manufacture 180,000 papers per hour at full capacity. Christian A. Eckstrom designed an eight-story expansion in 1921, completed in 1923. Eckstrom adopted some of Burnham's plan, but eliminated his mansard roof, making a more cohesive though less intricate building. A terra cotta cornice was removed in the 1980s. History William D. Boyce was born in Pennsylvania and grew up in a rural town. He moved to Chicago in 1881, where he gained experience in sales and publishing. He briefly moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, where he co-founded The Commercial, then found a job as a reporter in Fargo, North Dakota. In 1882, he moved to nearby Lisbon, North Dakota, and founded the Dakota Clipper weekly newspaper. During the 1884 World Cotton Centennial, Boyce worked at the Bureau of Correspondence, which provided news from the fair to 1200 member newspapers across the nation. He sold his interest in the Clipper in 1885 and returned to Chicago with an interest in small-town news. Boyce partnered with R. R. Donnelley to found a print service for small-town newspapers. These \\"ready print\\" stories catered to the interest of small-town readers, but were of higher quality than most towns could otherwise afford. He convinced Donnelley and two other partners to found a national weekly newspaper to cater to these audiences, the Saturday Blade. First published in June 1887, Boyce soon purchased the shares of his partners and managed the paper as the W. D. Boyce Publishing Company. Boyce purchased a story paper, the Chicago Ledger, in 1891. He consolidated his publishing interests into one building 1907. Boyce distributed his papers through a network of paperboys. At its peak in the 1910s, his agency was associated with 30,000 boys throughout the United States and Canada. While in London for business, Boyce happened across a Boy Scout. He sought out the leader of the organization, Robert Baden-Powell, and became interested in their practices. When he returned to Chicago, he founded a national chapter, the Boy Scouts of America. He agreed to turn over control of the organization to the Y.M.C.A. soon thereafter. He intended to continue to finance and print Boys' Life from his printing house, but the Y.M.C.A. refused. Though Boyce's affiliation with the Boy Scouts was brief, he soon founded a companion organization, the Lone Scouts of America. The Lone Scouts focused on Boyce's target audience‚Äîsmall town residents‚Äîwhich had been largely ignored by the burgeoning Boy Scout chapter. He published its magazine, Lone Scout, at the Boyce Building. By 1919, there were 300,000 Lone Scouts in 4,600 \\"tribes\\". However, the diminishing isolation felt in small town America by the 1920s due to improved technology and infrastructure caused a reduction in Lone Scout enrollment. Entrance The original Boyce Building was only four stories tall, even though the original plan was to build ten. The extra space was intended for lease, but Boyce did not see the need for additional income at the time. Now more financially strapped, Boyce commissioned the construction of the rest of his namesake building in 1921, completed two years later. The Lone Scouts were merged into the Boy Scouts in 1924. Boyce died in his penthouse on the top floor of the Boyce Building on June 11, 1929. The Boyce Building is the only remaining building associated with his publishing and scouting career. Earlier publishing buildings at 116 and 215 Dearborn, as well as an earlier office building at 32 North Dearborn, have been demolished. Both of Boyce's houses have been destroyed; only his hunting lodge at South Dakota's Fort Sisseton Historic State Park, which was not associated with his scouting or publishing interests, remains. The main period of significance for the building is 1912, when the first four-story portion was completed, to 1929, when Boyce died. The building was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places on February 29, 1996.

History The land Brown Canyon Ranch is on was first settled around 1880 by John Thomas Brown, who owned a hotel a few miles away in neighboring Ramsey Canyon. Following a succession of owners, the land eventually ended up in the hands of the brothers James and Tom Haverty. Between 1905 and 1907, James and his brother built what is today the most prominent building in the canyon, a modest three-room adobe home, now known as the Brown Canyon Ranch House. James and his wife Lessie homesteaded the ranch in 1912 and lived there until 1921, when it was sold to William and Margaret Carmichael. The Carmichaels were major landowners in the Sierra Vista area and did not take up residence at the house. Instead, they rented it out to a local miner named Harvey James and later a Yaqui Indian named Chico Romero and his family. In 1946, the Carmichaels sold the ranch to Roy and Stella Rambo, who raised cattle on it until 1957, when it was again sold to Samuel and Cecile Barchas. The Barchas family did not live on the ranch, either, but they raised livestock on it all the way up until 1997. One year later it was deeded to the United States Forest Service in a land exchange. Efforts to preserve and restore the historic ranch house, as well as its associated outbuildings, has been underway since 1998. In addition to the ranch house, there is also a one- room adobe storeroom adjacent to the house, a wooden corral and outhouse, the stone ruins of a barn, and a pair of man-made ponds, which are now used as a preserve for the endangered Chiricahua leopard frog. Further up the trail is a small graveyard known as the Brown Canyon Cemetery, followed by the ruins of an old house and the remains of the Pomono Mine. The ranch is open to hikers and picnickers, free of charge, for day use only.

He achieved a number of pioneering first ascents including sandstone spires in the American Southwest, and the first ascent of the Northwest Face of Half Dome with Royal Robbins and Mike Sherrick in 1957. Gallwas made his own heat-treated chrome-molybdenum steel alloy pitons, which contributed to the success of the climb. Gallwas studied chemistry at San Diego State University and spent much of his career working for scientific instrument maker Beckman Instruments, Inc. He helped to develop consensus standards for laboratory medicine, and served on the board of directors and as president of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards.  Early life  Gerald Ernst (Jerry) Gallwas was born in Whittier, California, the only child of Ernst and Lois Gallwas. Gallwas' father held many jobs, including farmer, iron worker, and commercial fisherman. His mother was a schoolteacher. Both parents were outdoor enthusiasts. Gallwas, a native of California, first showed an interest in climbing in junior high school. Using a Sierra Club publication drawing as a guide, he practiced rappelling on a hemp rope.Brower, David R., Ed., p.164, Manual of Ski Mountaineering, Brower, Second Edition, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles 1947. In 1950, Gallwas and his family vacationed in Yosemite National Park. On the front of Best Studio, now the Ansel Adams Gallery, Gallwas spied a picture of John Salath√© standing on the tip of the Lost Arrow taking a photograph of his climbing partner, Anton Nelson, as Nelson was rappelling. Gallwas imagined one day taking a photo where Salath√© stood. In 1954, Gallwas fulfilled that dream by completing the 5th ascent of the spire with Wayne Merry.Schutt, Art, Yosemite Climbs, The Mugelnoos* No.258, p.1, June 10, 1954.  Climbing experiences In 1951, Gallwas began climbing with members of the Sierra Club from Southern California, including Royal Robbins and Don Wilson. The three became known as \\"The Southern Californians\\" to distinguish them from other California climbing groups. Gallwas described his relationship with Robbins and Wilson as teenage amateurs in tennis shoes.

Pitons from these sources were made of mild steel that twisted and became unusable after only a few placements. Gallwas recognized the problem and was among the first to make and use heat-treated chrome- molybdenum steel alloy pitons. He patterned his pitons after John Salath√©'s so they could be placed hundreds of times without twisting. These improved pitons proved instrumental to the success of the first ascent of the Northwest Face of Half Dome in 1957. That same year, Yvon Chouinard began to produce and sell alloy-steel pitons. Chouinard's success with his pitons led him to establish Chouinard Equipment, Ltd, which later became Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd.

He later ran a clinical chemistry laboratory while serving in the Army Medical Corps. In 1964, he went on to work in diagnostics for scientific instrument maker Beckman Instruments, Inc. In 1972, Gallwas served as a spokesperson for the adoption of voluntary consensus standards for laboratory medicine as the Food and Drug Administration began to regulate the medical device industry. Gallwas served on the board of directors of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, now the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute for ten years and was its president from 1982 to 1984.  Philanthropy  Gallwas met Beckman Instruments founder Dr. Arnold Beckman and his wife, Mabel, within a few weeks of joining the company. Their friendship led to Gallwas' 40-year affiliation with the Arnold and Mable Beckman Foundation. Gallwas is credited with collecting and displaying Arnold Beckman's earliest inventions that helped launch the electronic revolution in the chemical and biological sciences. The inventions are displayed at the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center of the National Academies of Science and Engineering in Irvine, CA.

The major form of this disorder is also known as Cooley's anemia.  History  Established in 1954, the foundation was conceived by its founder, Frank Ficarra, the father of two children who were born with thalassemia. Although the Foundation was founded in Brooklyn, NY, it has over the years expanded its scope to include patients from across the United States.  Medical research  The Foundation supports medical research with the goal of improving treatment and finding a cure. Medical research considered for funding includes clinical trials in cell and gene therapies, and ongoing clinical projects with a focus on iron overload, cardiac complications, family planning, and psycho-social effects. In addition, fellowships are offered to clinical and basic science investigators (postdoctoral or junior faculty) with an interest in thalassemia or research with a direct application to thalassemia and/or its complications. In 2014, the Foundation awarded $300,000 in medical research funding. All applications are examined and discussed by a Medical Review Committee, composed of individuals with expertise in various aspects of thalassemia research and treatment. Among the many areas in which the Foundation has supported research are the mechanisms of iron regulation, gene editing, and gene therapy as potential curative approaches to thalassemia; vector development; nutritional requirements in thalassemia; strategies for improving adherence to thalassemia treatments; fertility and pregnancy in thalassemia; cardiac issues in thalassemia; pulmonary hypertension; fetal hemoglobin production; and approaches to iron chelation therapy. Published medical research funded in whole or in part by the Foundation includes: * \\"A mechanism for the specific immunogenicity of heat shock protein-chaperoned peptides\\" by R Suto, PK Srivastava * \\"The Development of Iron Chelators for Clinical Use\\" by Raymond J. Bergeron, Gary M. Brittenham Symposia with The New York Academy of Sciences Since 1964, the Foundation has partnered with the New York Academy of Sciences to present periodic symposia specifically focusing on the current status and future directions of clinical care and research in the area of thalassemia. As of 2014, nine of these Cooley's Anemia Symposia have been presented; the tenth is currently scheduled for October, 2015. These Symposia bring together experts in thalassemia from around the world and offer an opportunity for clinicians, scientists, nurses and others involved in thalassemia care and research to share information and learn about up-to-date therapies and strategies that can have a current and future impact on patient care. Collaborative work with government agencies The Foundation makes a priority of educating and informing government agencies and officials about the needs of the thalassemia community. * The Thalassemia Clinical Research Network (TCRN). This 10-year project was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and launched in 1998. The goal of the TCRN was to provide a national structure to conduct clinical studies in thalassemia. Experts from some of the nation's leading thalassemia treatment centers participated in this project. The Foundation played a significant role in establishing the need for this major project. *Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC has launched a number of thalassemia-based initiatives in recent years; the Foundation has helped to relay much of the information which contributed to the initiation of many of these projects. In 2004, the CDC began an 8-year Thalassemia Data and Blood Specimen Collection Project which responded to concerns about the need to identify possible pathogens in the blood supply as quickly as possible. (Due to the frequency with which thalassemia patients receive red blood cell transfusions, this is a substantial concern for the thalassemia community.) The CDC also has funded a Thalassemia Prevention Education and Outreach project, which was awarded to the Foundation under a cooperative agreement with the CDC. This project helps to educate individuals with thalassemia with evidence-based public health messages that can have a positive impact on health outcomes. Several thalassemia treatment centers have also received funding from the CDC as part of the Center's Prevention of Complications in Thalassemia project. *The Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When a new treatment for thalassemia is submitted to the FDA for review, the Foundation makes certain that the concerns of the thalassemia community are made known. Patient services Patient programs are a major component of the Foundation's activities. As a lifelong disorder, individuals born with thalassemia face a wide range of challenges from infancy onward. With advances in treatment resulting in a significant expansion of life expectancy, patients are discovering new challenges in adulthood which earlier generations of patients did not face. The Foundation provides a patient services department to help patients and family members learn about the disorder and its challenges and to provide them with information that can have a positive impact on meeting thalassemia- related challenges. Among the services offered by the Foundation are: * An annual Patient-Family Conference. The Patient-Family Conference gives members of the thalassemia community an opportunity to get together with other patients and family members in order to hear up-to-date information from doctors, nurses and scientists with significant experience in thalassemia. In addition, patients and family members share their own experiences and establish relationships that can help them devise ways to overcome difficulties they may be facing. * Patient services manager. This staff member works closely with patients and family members to help answer a wide range of questions related to the disorder. The patient services manager also provides assistance on issues such as navigating complicated insurance questions and seeking out sources of assistance with high co-payments. * CAF social worker. The Foundation engages an on-staff social worker to assist patients and family members develop strategies to help them better cope with issues related to thalassemia. * Patient outreach director. The Foundation is committed to reaching as many individuals with thalassemia as possible and making available to them information sufficient to properly managing their thalassemia. The patient outreach director devises strategies for identifying new patients and for maintaining appropriate communications with patients and family members on the CAF database.

Sida Miscellany 14 The epithet was proposed by Albert William Herre who considered the lichen to be a new species but did not describe the species or publish the name. . Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia rosei is classified in the subgenus Vermilacinia in which it is distinguished from related species by its thallus divided into relatively few fan-shaped branches (less than 10)‚Äîwidely expanded above a short narrow stalk- like base‚Äîand by its secondary metabolites of triterpenes, referred to as T1 and T2 by their Rf values on thin-layer chromatography plates; their formulas are C30H50O2 (T1) and C30H50OO (T2). Lichen substances also include the triterpene zeorin and the diterpene (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane that characterize subgenus Vermilacinia. The broadly expanded branches from base to apex is similar to V. robusta, which differs by lacking the T1, T2 triterpenes, and by having a definite tubular shape to the branches. Vermilacinia varicosa, also from Isla San Roque, appears morphological indistinguishable from V. rosei, differing only in chemistry, lacking the two triterpenes, which appear to have phytogeography significance in the species classification of Vermilacinia. A specimen from Cedros Island referred to this species, collected by Richard Spjut and Richard Marin in April 1990, differs by having a thicker reticulate ridged cortex, 75‚Äì110 ¬µm thick, compared to the cortex in the type collection with crater-like depression, 45‚Äì65(-75)¬µm thick. Taxonomic History Vermilacinia rosei was described by Richard Spjut in 1996 from study of herbarium specimens at the United States National Herbarium, Smithsonian Institution. Peter Bowler and Janet Marsh in 2004 included V. rosei under their Niebla laevigata (= Vermilacinia laevigata), among five other species of Vermilacinia without explanation.Bowler, P. and J.

Berlin has many gay districts, with the biggest of them, Sch√∂neberg, also being the first in the world. History Berlin has a long history of gay culture and influence on popular entertainment, and according to some authors, in the 1920s the city was the Gay Capital of Europe. In 1896 the world's first gay magazine started in Berlin, called ' (\\"The Self-Owning\\"). Magnus Hirschfeld, a German physician, founded the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee in May 1897 as a subset of Berlin's Institute for the Science of Sexuality. Not only was this organization the first of its kind in Germany, it was the first gay-rights organization in the world to lobby for the rights of gay, lesbian, and transgender people, with a focus on legal representation. During the 1920s and 1930s the world's first gay village was in Berlin's Sch√∂neberg. Gay and lesbian bars and nightclubs flourished, as did queer artistic expression through films, music, and print publications. Cabaret singer Claire Waldoff and actress Marlene Dietrich lived and worked in Berlin's queer neighborhoods during this time. The first gay demonstration ever also started in Berlin in 1922. The Reichstag nearly decriminalized homosexuality in 1929, before the year‚Äôs economic crash made a final vote impossible. The rise of fascism in Germany in 1933 put increasingly pressure on Berlin‚Äôs homosexual community as officials closed bars such as Eldorado and banned gay publications, forcing Berlin‚Äôs homosexual men and women either underground or into camps. Homosexuality would only be decriminalized in 1969, which allowed for a much more open expression of gay and lesbian culture. The ' (', Gay Action West Berlin) was the first modern gay organization in Germany, founded in 1971. Initially an all-male group, ' protested many lingering anti-sodomy laws. In 1985, Berlin opened the world's first Gay Museum, otherwise known as the ', \\"a private institution dedicated to preserving, exhibiting, and discovering gay and lesbian history, art, and culture.\\" Contemporary Berlin actively promotes tourism in gay neighborhoods, including Sch√∂neberg.

In 1986 the yearling filly was consigned to the Fasig-Tipton sale where she was sold for $150,000 to John A. Bell III of the Kentucky-based Jonabell Farm. The ownership of the filly stayed in the family as John Bell was the father of Epitome's breeders'. She was sent into training with Philip M. Hauswald. Racing career =1987: two-year-old season= Epitome began her racing career by finishing fifth in a maiden race at Belmont Park on 28 June.

Fairy tale When the Evil Queen had learned from her Magic Mirror that Snow White will be the fairest of them all, she orders an unnamed Huntsman to take Snow White into the deepest woods to be killed. As proof that Snow White is dead, the Queen demands that he return with her lungs and liver. The Huntsman takes Snow White into the forest. But after raising his knife, he fails to kill her as she sobs heavily and begs him not to. The Huntsman leaves her behind alive convinced that the girl would be eaten by some wild animal. He instead brings the Queen the lungs and liver of a big wild boar, which is prepared by the cook and eaten by the Queen. Modern adaptations =1916 film= In the 1916 silent movie adaption, the Huntsman is named Berthold (portrayed by Lionel Braham). =Disney= The Huntsman appears in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs voiced by Stuart Buchanan. The Evil Queen is so jealous of Snow White's beauty that she orders the Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her while stating that he knows the penalty should he fail. She further demands that the Huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jewelled box as proof of the deed. When he is about to use his knife on Snow White, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. After revealing the Queen wants her dead, he tearfully begs for her forgiveness. The Huntsman urges Snow White to flee into the woods and never come back to the castle. When the Evil Queen shows the Magic Mirror the heart in the jewelled box as the proof she holds of Snow White's death later that night, the Magic Mirror reveals that the heart in the box is a pig's heart, causing the Queen to take matters into her own hands. The Huntsman does not appear again afterwards in the film. In \\"The 7 Dwarfs and King Arbor's Crystal\\" comic that showed the Evil Queen's hag form having survived the fall, the Huntsman had gotten his revenge on the Evil Queen by setting fire to her castle just as her hag form on a stretcher and the two royal guards that were loyal to her returned to the burning castle. In the musical adaptation, the Huntsman is seen with the Prince when they tell the King of the Evil Queen's plot to dispose of Snow White. In 1994, the Huntsman was added when the attraction Snow White's Scary Adventures was modified. Here, the Huntsman is voiced by Peter Renaday. =Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics= The Huntsman appears in the \\"Snow White\\" episode of Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics voiced by Mike Reynolds in the English dub. He is sent by the Evil Queen to eliminate Snow White. This plan fails when Snow White's friend Klaus buys Snow White enough time to get away. When the Huntsman goes after Snow White, he is attacked by a wild boar and knocked off the cliff into the forest below. =Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child= In the Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child rendition of Snow White that is set to a Native American theme, the character Gray Wolf (voiced by Zahn McClarnon) is in the role of the Huntsman. He is from the same tribe as his older sister Sly Fox. Gray Wolf is summoned by Sly Fox where he is instructed to take White Snow into the forest and kill her while bringing her liver as proof. When Gray Wolf does take her into the forest, he cannot bring himself to kill White Snow as it is not a warrior's way to kill a child. When White Snow learns that Sly Fox wants her dead, Gray Wolf instructs her to flee into the woods and never return. Once White Snow has fled into the woods, Gray Wolf takes the liver of a deer offscreen to pass off as White Snow's liver. Later that night, he visits Chief Brown Bear's tribe and states that he cannot stay. Before leaving, he gives Sly Fox a bag containing the liver which Sly Fox claims is the bear's liver that he promised her as Sly Fox plans to cook it up immediately. =Muppet Snow White= In the four-part comic Muppet Snow White as part of The Muppet Show comics, the Huntsman is played by Sweetums. The Evil Queen (played by Miss Piggy) orders the Huntsman to kill Snow White (played by Spamela Hamderson). But the Huntsman refuses to kill Snow White, tells her that the Queen wants her dead, and orders her to flee as far away from the kingdom as she can. =Once Upon a Time= The Huntsman appears in the first season of Once Upon a Time played by Jamie Dornan. The Huntsman is a nameless hunter who is a solitary recluse, raised by wolves. He considers the wolves to be his true family, and is greatly saddened by the deaths of animals. He is considered by the Evil Queen Regina the perfect assassin, and is hired to kill Snow White, though he spares her for selflessness. When he offers the Queen a stag's heart instead, she realizes she has been tricked and tears out the Huntsman's heart, keeping it in her vault and using it to make him her slave. When Prince Charming is led to his execution, the Huntsman helps him escape. The Prince asks him to assist him, but he states he cannot leave and not to let the sacrifice of his heart be in vain. In Storybrooke, he is Sheriff Graham Humbert, the town's handsome and level-headed police officer. In the earlier parts of Storybrooke, Sheriff Graham helps Mayor Regina Mills in preventing Owen and Kurt Flynn from leaving town. When Emma Swan arrives, he is one of the few residents who go against Regina, making her his deputy. He and Emma are attracted to each other, though he has a secret sexual relationship with Regina, which Emma later discovers, feeling betrayed and disgusted. As he experiences flashbacks of his previous life, he seeks advice from Henry Mills, who tells him of his story. After Graham is unable to locate his heart, he ends his relationship with Regina and starts a new relationship with Emma, regaining his lost memories in the process. However, Regina crushes his heart and he dies in Emma's arms, shortly after thanking Emma for helping him remember who he truly was. =The Huntsman film series= Snow White and the Huntsman The Huntsman is one of the two title characters in the film Snow White and the Huntsman, played by Chris Hemsworth. Eric is a huntsman whose wife, Sara, was seemingly killed while he was fighting in a war. After Snow White escapes into the Dark Forest, Queen Ravenna and her brother Finn make a bargain with Eric the Huntsman to capture Snow White, promising to bring his wife back to life in exchange. The Huntsman tracks down Snow White, but when Finn reveals that Ravenna does not actually have the power to do what she promised, the Huntsman fights him and his men while Snow White runs away. Throughout the film, Eric becomes Snow White's ally in the fight against Queen Ravenna. His allegiance slowly becomes both absolute (after finding himself smitten by the same purity in the princess that he loved in his wife) and resolute (after the revelation of the Queen's duplicity having been the cause of the death of his wife). The Huntsman: Winter's War The Huntsman is the title character in the film The Huntsman: Winter's War (which is a prequel to Snow White and the Huntsman). Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as Eric the Huntsman, the film opening with a prequel scene exploring his growth as a Huntsman under the command of Freya, the sister of Ravenna. He flees her kingdom after his wife Sara is killed due to Freya's attempts to make her huntsmen reject love (it is never clarified how Sara's death as shown here can be reconciled with Finn claiming that Ravenna was responsible). Seven years later, after the events of the original film, Eric is called upon to ensure the destruction of Ravenna's mirror, but in the process he is pitted against Freya and reunited with Sara, who reveals that her 'death' was staged by Freya, who used her magic to make Eric see Sara's death while Sara saw Eric apparently leave her behind. Eric is able to convince Sara of the deception, but Freya briefly uses the mirror to resurrect Ravenna, only for Freya to assist her huntsmen in killing Ravenna when she learns that her sister was responsible for the death of her baby daughter. =Ever After High= In Ever After High, the character Hunter Huntsman (voiced by Grant George) is the son of the Huntsman.

He held the 110 m hurdles world record from 1929 to 1934 and competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics. Career Wennstr√∂m became an elite hurdler at a young age, challenging Sweden's established top hurdler Sten Pettersson and winning his first national title in 1927 as an 18-year-old. He represented Sweden at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam and nearly qualified for the final, placing third in his semi-final. Wennstr√∂m reached his peak in 1929, consistently running under 15 seconds and winning another Swedish national title; finally on 25 August, in a dual meet against Norway at Stockholm, he broke the world record with his time of 14.4. Although a number of other athletes, starting with Earl Thomson in 1920, had run the slightly shorter 120 yd (109.7 m) hurdles in 14.4, Wennstr√∂m was the first to do so over the metric distance. There were some doubts about the validity of Wennstr√∂m's mark, with wind assistance and unreliable clocks cited as possible factors in it, but the International Amateur Athletic Federation, responsible for officially ratifying world records, found no problems with the time and accepted it. Wennstr√∂m lost his best shape after the 1929 season and never regained it, although he did become Swedish champion for a third and final time in 1931.
