History In 1867, a Local Board was formed for part of the civil parish of Hornsey. The rest of the parish was already under South Hornsey Local Board, formed in 1865. In 1894, under the Local Government Act of that year, Hornsey became an urban district. In 1903, it was incorporated as a municipal borough. The corporation made two unsuccessful attempts to gain county borough status in 1904 and 1915. The borough was part of the London postal district and Metropolitan Police District. The borough's coat of arms, granted in 1904, featured two oak trees recalling the ancient forest that once covered the area and surviving remnants including Queen's Wood, Highgate Wood and Coldfall Wood. The manor of Hornsey had at one time been held by the Diocese of London and crossed swords, taken from the Diocese's arms, completed the design. The borough's motto was , . One of the municipal borough's first significant projects was the opening of Hornsey Cottage Hospital in 1910. Hornsey Town Hall, built in 1933-35 and designed by Reginald Uren, was widely admired for its clean, Modernist style and beautiful detailing, symbolising enlightened local government. However, since 2004 Haringey Council gradually removed municipal services from the building, and its increasing dereliction caused a local furore. In 1965, the municipal borough was abolished and its area was transferred to Greater London under the London Government Act 1963. Hornsey's area was combined with the Municipal Borough of Tottenham and the Municipal Borough of Wood Green to form the present-day London Borough of Haringey.

Originally a radio play series of the Bavarian Radio in 1961, the stories were later adapted into books, a successful TV series of the same name, three films and a musical. Pumuckl is a red-haired Kobold and descendant of the Klabauterm√§nner. He is invisible to people around him except for the master carpenter Eder with whom Pumuckl lives. He's also known in some parts of the world, especially in Asia as Adib. Pumuckl is one of the most popular characters in children's entertainment in Germany and several generations have now grown up with the cheeky but funny little Kobold. Plot How Pumuckl and Master Eder met= Being a descendant of the Klabautermann people, who were sailors, Pumuckl loves everything that has to do with the ocean, especially sailboats. For reasons unknown, he gets lost in Bavaria, where no ships are to be found. He doesn't like neat and clean places, so he takes refuge in a carpenter's untidy workshop. The workshop belongs to elderly Meister Eder. It is precisely the fact that the workshop is untidy which seals Pumuckl's fate. He gets stuck on an overflowing pot of glue. It is a rule among Kobolds that whenever one of his kind gets stuck to something manmade, they become visible, and according to the rules of their ancestors, must stay with the human who sees them, in this case Meister Eder. On the show and in the books, Pumuckl is always visible if nobody other than Meister Eder is present. However, he turns invisible when other people come into view. At first, Meister Eder is reluctant to take in the kobold, since he is quite content on his own, but Pumuckl makes it clear that he has no other choice. A deep friendship soon blossoms between the elderly man and the cheeky kobold. Note: Meister Eder's profession is given as \\"Schreinermeister\\" in the original German, which means that he makes and repairs furniture, which is also shown on the show (and mentioned in the stories / radio plays). The term \\"Meister\\" means that Eder has the qualification to take in apprentices. In Germany at the time, it was common to refer to handymen by their professional title and their last name, the way it is still done with doctors. =A typical Pumuckl story= There are several ways for a Pumuckl story to begin. These include: * Pumuckl feels bored in the workshop, so Meister Eder tells him to go out to explore, but not get into trouble. Naturally, Pumuckl gets into trouble. * Pumuckl is bored and sneaks out of the workshop without Meister Eder's approval. He meets the people in the neighborhood, eavesdrops on them and occasionally plays a practical joke on them or else tries to help them (with varying levels of success). * A client enters the workshop who has something Pumuckl fancies. * A client enters the workshop and discovers a belonging of Pumuckl's (typically one of the tiny pieces of furniture that Meister Eder has made for him); he/she wants to purchase it at all cost. * A conflict between Meister Eder and his sister or his cleaning woman is shown. Pumuckl tries to help. * Meister Eder and Pumuckl go on holiday or on a day trip. * Meister Eder is ridiculed by somebody (usually because he believes in Pumuckl), and Pumuckl tries to make things better. * Meister Eder presents Pumuckl with a gift *:Note: Usually, this ends with the gift being withdrawn. * Pumuckl discovers something in Meister Eder's household (e.g. matches) and plays with it. At the end of each episode of the 1980s TV show, Pumuckl and Meister Eder usually reconcile. However, some episodes end with Pumuckl being punished. At the end of one episode, in which Pumuckl tries to make chocolate pudding without Meister Eder's permission, Eder confines Pumuckl to the balcony and eats the pudding alone. Other episodes end with Eder's withdrawal of something he gave to the little kobold. The two-part story \\"Der gro√üe Krach\\" (\\"The big dispute\\") has the first part ending with Eder throwing Pumuckl and his bed out of the workshop. But by the end of the second part, the two have reconciled. Main characters Pumuckl = Pumuckl sitting on Meister Eder's (Gustl Bayrhammer) shoulder. Pumuckl's character is usually childishly immature and mischievous. Since the Pumuckl stories are aimed at children, we presume that he was written this way so that children can relate to him. Pumuckl's age is never mentioned. He had a life before he became visible, but it was very different: he didn't have to eat and was immune to cold and heat. Meister Eder sees Pumuckl as a child and usually appears as his guardian. He often tries to teach him some morals, not always with the desired result. For example, he never really manages to suppress Pumuckl's urge to steal things, though he always makes him give back what the little kobold has taken. Pumuckl is occasionally very selfish, and sometimes this leads to actual wrongdoing. However, when Pumuckl realises that he has hurt somebody, he feels genuine remorse and does everything he can to help that person. In the TV show Pumuckl is usually dressed in a yellow shirt and green trousers. He wears those clothes right from the first time Meister Eder sees him. Only one episode, \\"Der Wollpullover\\" (\\"The woollen sweater\\"), deals with Pumuckl's occasional need for other clothes. The kobold always is barefoot. In the audio plays and TV show, Pumuckl was voiced by actor Hans Clarin. =Meister Eder= He appears to be the exact opposite of Pumuckl. The little kobold likes to get in trouble, but the elderly carpenter prefers to stay out of trouble and keeps to himself. He spends most of his time with Pumuckl. However, he has a couple of friends, elderly handymen like himself, whom he regularly meets in the local pub to have a beer. Meister Eder, whose first name is given as \\"Franz\\" on the TV show, has a sister and two young nieces, Barbara, nicknamed B√§rbel (as seen in the episode \\"Eder bekommt Besuch\\"/\\"Eder gets visitors\\") and Monika (as seen in the episode \\"Pumuckl und die Ostereier\\"/\\"Pumuckl and the Easter eggs\\"). Furthermore, he has a nephew named Dieter (as seen in the episode \\"Die Bergtour\\"/\\"The hiking tour\\"). Meister Eder's sister is concerned because her brother has never found a wife and spends a lot of time alone, which occasionally leads to conflicts between the siblings. Other family members are his cousin Irma and her son Fritzl (as seen in the episode \\"Der verh√§ngnisvolle Schlagrahm\\"/\\"The fateful whipped cream\\"). Although his workshop is often in disorder, Meister Eder likes a clean living space (he lives in a flat above his workshop), which is why he has a cleaning lady, who serves as a supporting character in several stories. Being very different from Pumuckl, Meister Eder is presented as a law-abiding citizen who is meticulous on the job and always polite. He also completely fails to have sympathy with Pumuckl when the latter steals things. When the little kobold plays a minor practical joke, his behavior is sometimes condoned by Eder, because it made him laugh or think. In the TV show, Bavarian actor Gustl Bayrhammer played Master Eder. =Supporting characters= * Mrs. Eichinger - She is Meister Eder's cleaning lady. She is incredibly superstitious and constantly tries to persuade Meister Eder to believe in the same things she does, for instance by reading him his horoscope. Meister Eder usually reacts in a dismissive way, but that doesn't keep the cleaning lady from trying again. * Mr. Bernbacher - a welder and best friend of Meister Eder. Bernbacher is the one who always teases Meister Eder about Pumuckl. In several episodes, that results in an indignant Pumuckl pulling pranks on Bernbacher. * Mr. Schmitt - runs a small car repair shop. He's another friend of Meister Eder's. * Mr. Wimmer - a person who never appears on the show in person, though he can be heard occasionally during phone conversations. Wimmer operates an antique store which Meister Eder sometimes repairs pieces of furniture for. * Mr. Schwertfeger - an elderly acquaintance of Mr. Eder. Appears in the film and in a few episodes. His trademark is wearing two glasses at once, one on the nose and one on the forehead. * Mr. and Mrs. St√ºrzlinger - the caretakers of the house in which Mr. Eder lives and works. * Mrs. Hartl - Eder's nosy and capricious neighbor. History 1961: Radio plays= Pumuckl's character was invented in 1961 by the German novelist Ellis Kaut after she wrote a short story about a naughty demon for a radio drama series at the Bavarian Radio. The first episode of the show was broadcast on February 21, 1962 and the last episode was broadcast on December 30, 1973. A total of 90 episodes were created. Pumuckl's naughty character was an immediate success among the young audience. =1965: Books= In 1963 a competition was held at Munich's graphic art academy which focused on the creation of Pumuckl's appearance. The winner was Barbara von Johnson. In 1965 Pumuckl's first book was published. The book consisted of illustrations made by Johnson. Between 1965 and 1978, ten books which consisted of 60 stories were published by the publisher Stuttgart- Herald. Only in 1991 an eleventh book was published which consisted of six more stories. Thus a total of 66 stories have been published in book form until today. =1969: records= 33 LPs were created since 1969 which were based on the radio show, however, there was way less dialect than on the radio shows. On the records Pumuckl was played by Hans Clarin and Master Eder was played by Alfred Pongratz. After the death of Alfred Pongratz six more LPs were produced, each with two episodes, in which Gustl Bayrhammer played Master Eder and Harald Leipnitz was the narrator. After the success of the movie and the first TV season, a complete new edition was created which consisted of 86 episodes in cassette format in which Gustl Bayrhammer played Meister Eder. =1972: Feature film \\"Meister Eder and his Pumuckl\\"= Between 1979 and 1982 the first Pumuckl feature film was released under the title \\"Meister Eder and his Pumuckl\\". Pumuckl appears in the film and in all the subsequently films and TV series, as a cartoon character in a real environment. =1982-1988: TV series \\"Meister Eder and his Pumuckl\\"= The first season of the series was broadcast on Bavarian television as a German-Hungarian co-production during 1982-1983 and consisted of 26 half-hour episodes. Many well-known German actors like Willy Harlander, Erni Singerl, Toni Berger, Wolfgang V√∂lz and Helga Feddersen had appearances in the series. In addition, it featured many one-time guest appearances of famous German actors like Lisa Fitz, Gisela Uhlen, Helmut Fischer, Barbara Valentin, Gaby Dohm, Klaus Schwarzkopf, Georg Thomalla, Barbara Rudnik, Iris Berben, Fredl Fesl, Karla Bonoff and Rolf Zacher. The series was directed by Ulrich K√∂nig. The second season of the series which was broadcast during 1988-1989 consisted of another 26 episodes. =1994: Feature film \\"Pumuckl and the blue Klabauter\\"= Gustl Bayrhammer died in 1993. Because of his death before the completion of the film, Bayrhammers voice was dubbed in the remaining segments of the film by the actor Wolf Euba. =1995-2007: TV show \\"Pumuckl TV\\"= In 1995 ARD started to broadcast \\"Pumuckl TV\\". Hans Clarin played the villain in this series. =1999: TV series \\"Pumuckls Abenteuer\\"= In 1999 another 13 episodes were broadcast on the Children's Channel, under the title \\"Pumuckl's Abenteuer\\". Due to Bayrhammer's death, the plot occurred aboard a ship and focused on Pumuckl and the ship's cook. This third season did not reach the popularity of the first two seasons of the show broadcast in the 1980s. =2000: Musical \\"Meister Eder and his Pumuckl\\"= On October 21, 2000 a Pumuckl musical called \\"Meister Eder and his Pumuckl\\" started to play in Munich. The musical has had over 250,000 spectators. =2003: Feature film \\"Pumuckl and his circus adventures\\"= The film \\"Pumuckl and his Circus Adventure\\" was produced between 1999 and 2003. In the movie, Eder died off-screen, resulting in Pumuckl deciding to move to Eder's cousin, who is played by Hans Clarin, who, due to his bad health, was no longer able to voice Pumuckl, which is why the character was voiced by Kai Taschner instead. Pumuckl Controversy According to Reuters News, April 11, 2007, Ellis Kaut is going to court in a dispute over the impending marriage of Pumuckl. The illustrator, Barbara von Johnson, is supporting a local TV show's contest to design a girlfriend for Pumuckl. The winner will get to visit von Johnson's Munich villa and take part in a \\"wedding\\" staged for the popular fictional character. According to the same Reuters article, von Johnson said Pumuckl deserves a girlfriend but Kaut said the character must stay true to his spirit nature. According to Spiegel Online, January 10, 2008 the verdict was: Pumuckl may marry - at least he could now if he wanted to.

In 1933 it was incorporated as a municipal borough. It was part of the London postal district and Metropolitan Police District. A coat of arms was granted to the borough on incorporation. The shield featured yew trees and was supported by medieval archers, recalling that Wood Green had once been an area where archery was practised. A silver and blue stripe across the centre of the shield depicted the New River. The Latin motto was nostrum viret robur, which could be translated as our strength is a tree or more appropriately as Wood Green Flourishes.Letters Patent dated August 1, 1933 In 1893, Earlham Grove House (later known as Woodside House) was purchased by the Local Board to serve as a Town Hall. It accommodated the area's first public library, and in 1913 a single-storey extension was added to provide a council chamber for meetings of the Urban District Council.

In addition to the course of instruction N6 Department conducts, N6 instructors support the N5 Department as Command and Control instructors and evaluators during Air Wing Fallon Detachment training. N6 Department resides in the Fleet Training Building with the N3, N7, and N8 departments. The Navy Fighter Weapon School (N7) instructs advanced methods of strike-fighter employment through the \\"TOPGUN\\" Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor (SFTI) course. It also conducts the Senior Officers Course (SOC); and manages air wing power projection training. N7 personnel retain the traditional light blue T-shirts and light brown leather nametags worn by TOPGUN personnel and have their own spaces (shared with N6 and N8) separate from the main NAWDC building that house the heritage of TOPGUN legacy in forms of photos and other memorabilia. The NAWDC F-16 and F/A-18 aircraft sport the TOPGUN patch on the tail. The Navy Rotary Wing Weapons School (N8) instructs graduate-level rotary wing employment through the \\"SEAWOLF\\" Seahawk Weapons and Tactics Instructor (SWTI) course. It also conducts the Strike Leader Attack Training Syllabus (SLATS), Senior Officers Course (SOC), assists N5 with airwing training, and manages the Navy's Mountain Flying Course. Operational Risk Management/Safety Department (N9) manages air-and-ground related safety programs as well as medical training programs. The Airborne Electronic Attack Weapons School (N10) is the EA-18G Growler weapons school and conducts the \\"HAVOC\\" Growler Tactics Instructor course.  Training  NSAWC F-16As and an F/A-18A over Nevada, in 2005. There are two distinct areas of NAWDC training using the FRTC extensively ‚Äì carrier air wing (CVW) training and the \\"TOPGUN\\" SFTI, \\"CAEWWS\\" HEWTI, \\"HAVOC\\" GTI, and \\"SEAWOLF\\" SWTI graduate level courses. Air wing training brings together all of an air wing's squadrons for four weeks, providing strike planning and execution training opportunities in a dynamic, realistic, scenario-driven simulated wartime environment. Air wing training consists of power projection training in strike warfare, amphibious operations, joint battlefield operations, CAS, and CSAR. The Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor (SFTI) course is advanced tactics training for FA-18A-F aircrew in the Navy and Marine Corps through the execution of a demanding air combat syllabus and it produces graduate-level strike fighter tacticians, adversary instructors, and Air Intercept Controllers (AIC). The Growler Tactics Instructor (GTI) course is advanced tactics training for EA-18G aircrew in the Navy through the execution of a demanding air combat and electronic warfare syllabus and produces graduate-level electronic warfare tacticians. The Seahawk Weapons and Tactics Instructor (SWTI) course develops the Navy's helicopter tactics doctrine via the SEAWOLF Manual; instructs the Navy's Mountain Flying School; provides high-altitude, mountainous flight experience for sea-going squadrons; and provide academic, ground, flight, and opposing-forces instruction for visiting aircrew during Air Wing Fallon detachments. NAWDC staff members augment \\"adversary\\" air support, or \\"bandit\\" presentations, to support airborne portions of the training. NAWDC also annually hosts a ten-day CSAR exercise providing all-service participation with one full week of exercise flying involved. Concurrent with each SFTI course, NAWDC conducts an Adversary Training Course where pilots receive individual instruction in threat simulation, effective threat presentation and adversary tactics. Each class trains five to six Air Intercept Controllers in effective strike/fighter command and control. In the classroom, NAWDC also conducts tactically oriented courses. The SOC addresses strategic and tactical issues at the battle group commander, air wing commander and squadron commanding officer level. SLATS introduces junior Navy and Marine Corps officers to all aspects of air wing, battle group and joint force tactics, planning and hardware. Another important course is the Advanced Mission Commander's Course (AMCC) which focuses on the airborne battle management, providing graduate-level command, control and communication training to E-2C mission commanders and other carrier aircraft plane commanders.  Tactics development  The Plans, Programs and Tactics (N5) department utilizes both NAWDC and fleet aircraft to develop the latest in airwing tactics. These are standardized and promulgated to the fleet via the Naval Warfare Publication 3-01 Carrier Airwing Tactical Memo, and updated bi-annually. The N5 department forms a core of expertise which functions to advise the Chief of Naval Operations on programmatic issues, and lends its support to real world operations as targeteers providing extensive liaison and standardization to other Naval and joint training agencies.  Range  The Fallon Range Training Complex (FRTC) encompasses more than of airspace east of NAS Fallon, including a vast array of electronic systems supporting squadron, airwing and SFTI training. The heart of this program is the Advanced Digital Display System or ADDS. This computer-supported real-time digital display allows monitoring of each training event as it occurs on the ranges and recording capability for debriefing. Information is transmitted instantaneously from each aircraft to large screen displays at NAWDC and recorded for playback to the aircrews for post flight analysis of procedures and tactics. This system also allows controllers and aircrews to view an event from several different aspects in three dimensions. Naval intelligence One of NAWDC's most interactive departments is N2, naval intelligence. Within this department are targeting and weapons experts, assisted by enlisted intelligence specialists, who gather data on potential trouble areas around the globe where deployed naval forces might be called for presence or action. Inherent in the intelligence mission is preparation of aircrews for all circumstances they may face in combat. Another function of NAWDC's intelligence department is contingency preparation. When called upon, members will deploy, armed with the latest intelligence gathered, to assist commanders in theater.

The architect was Charles Jones, who also designed several other buildings and features in the borough. The borough was greatly enlarged in 1926 when it absorbed the urban districts of Greenford (including the parishes of Perivale and West Twyford) and Hanwell.Youngs 1979, p. ? Accordingly, the size of the borough council was increased: by 1960 it consisted of a mayor, 16 aldermen and 48 councillors. In 1952 there was a failed attempt to gain county borough status. In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, the municipal borough was abolished and its former area transferred to Greater London to be combined with the Municipal Borough of Acton and Municipal Borough of Southall to form the present-day London Borough of Ealing. An oak tree like in the borough coat of arms is now present in the coat of arms of the London Borough of Ealing. Coat of arms Granted on February 22, 1902, the Municipal Borough's coat of arms (not to be confused with the modern borough's coat of arms) was: Per chevron gules and argent, in dexter chief two swords in saltire and in sinister chief three seaxes (Saxon swords) fessewise in pale all proper, with pommels and hilts or, and in base an oak tree eradicated (uprooted) also proper. The crossed swords are the symbol of Saint Paul and taken from the arms of the See of London, to which the manor historically belonged.

It was founded in 1885 by A. Woodburn as the Ottawa Evening Journal. Its first editor was John Wesley Dafoe who came from the Winnipeg Free Press. In 1886, it was bought by Philip Dansken Ross. The paper began publishing a morning edition in 1917. In 1919, the paper's publishers bought the Ottawa Free Press. The former owner of that paper, E. Norman Smith, then became editor with Grattan O'Leary. In 1959, it was bought by F.P. Publications. By then, the Journal, whose readers tended to come from rural areas, was trailing the Ottawa Citizen, its main competitor. The paper encountered labour problems during the 1970s and never really recovered. In 1980, it was bought by Thomson Newspapers and was closed on 27 August 1980. This left Southam Newspapers's Ottawa Citizen as the only major English language newspaper in Ottawa (Le Droit remaining the only French language daily newspaper in Ottawa). The closure aroused considerable controversy at the time since a day later, Southam closed the Winnipeg Tribune, the primary rival to Thomson's Winnipeg Free Press. Concern over these incidents prompted the federal government to conduct the Royal Commission on Newspapers, commonly known as the Kent Commission. To many, it seemed that possibly illegal collusion to reduce competition had occurred. Charges were brought against both Southam and Thomson in April 1981 under the now-defunct Combines Investigation Act, alleging a breach of section 33 of that act through merger or monopolistic conduct, but they were dismissed on 9 December 1983. Ottawa went without a second major newspaper until the debut of the Ottawa Sun in 1988. The paper's politics were generally regarded as conservative.

The Poor Law union area was used again for the purposes of the Public Health Act 1875 and Chingford became part of the Epping Rural Sanitary District that was created in 1875. In 1894 Chingford became an urban district. District and borough Under a county review order in 1934, a small part of Waltham Holy Cross Urban District was transferred to Chingford. It gained the status of municipal borough in 1938. Abolition The Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London considered the borough for inclusion in Greater London in 1960 and subsequently it was abolished by the London Government Act 1963. Its former area was transferred to Greater London from Essex and was combined with the Municipal Borough of Walthamstow and the Municipal Borough of Leyton to form the present-day London Borough of Waltham Forest.

Early life Judge was the son of George Hayler, who lived in Battle, Sussex and had been a noted Chartist campaigner. Judge's younger brother was Guy Hayler, who was a noted teetotal Temperance movement organiser. Judge attended St. Mary's National School and Parker's Endowed School at Hastings. It was in 1861 that he changed his name in recognition of an inheritance. He trained as an architect but immediately specialised in sanitation and hygiene schemes, and was appointed as the first curator of the Parkes Museum of Hygiene at University College London. He was also the founder and Hon. Secretary of the Sunday Society which campaigned for the opening of museums on Sundays (the President was the Dean of Westminster Abbey). Professional experience Hygiene was of increasing importance to the late Victorians as cities grew in population and needed extensive sewerage systems. Judge's experience led to him being appointed Chief Surveyor to the Sanitary Assurance Association from 1880, and he was also Secretary of the International Medical and Sanitary Exhibition at Kensington in 1881. Judge set up his professional practice on Park Place Villas in Maida Vale. Involvement in local government In London, the Metropolitan Board of Works was responsible for sanitary work. Judge came to the belief that the structure of the Board, with the members of which were nominated by individual vestries rather than being directly elected, was fundamentally corrupt. In 1886 the Financial News printed allegations that officials of the board had conspired with some members to make personal profits from the sale of surplus land. That November, Judge obtained a seat on Paddington Vestry and established the grandly-titled \\"Metropolitan Board of Works Enquiry Committee\\" which looked into allegations of corruption. The Financial News allegations were of such magnitude that a Royal Commission had to be set up under Lord Herschell in 1887. Judge's Committee was represented at the Commission by its own counsel and Judge tried to assist by requesting, in his capacity as a ratepayer, the records of the Board; he was supposed to keep these records confidential, but by giving them to counsel he ensured that they were made public. In addition, in the midst of the scandal, one of Paddington's seats on the Board fell vacant and the Vestry chose Judge as its new representative; he was cheered by the public gallery on 22 June 1888 when taking his seat. Member of the Board Judge was firm in his belief that corruption was entrenched at the Board, but the Commission found otherwise. Although the Financial News allegations were predominantly upheld (and more corruption was uncovered), the Commission stated that the vast majority of members of the Board were entirely above suspicion. Judge was audibly dissatisfied with the conclusion; he had moved at the Board (16 November 1888) for a special committee to consider prosecutions of corrupt officers and members, but failed to find a seconder. On 14 December, he deliberately disrupted the meeting by insisting on disputing the accuracy of the minutes (the Board passed a motion that he be no longer heard), and then proceeded through the meeting \\"with a continuous cannonade of objections\\" (according to The Times). However, the question of reform of the Board had become moot by the announcement as the Royal Commission was beginning its hearing that it would be abolished and replaced by an elected London County Council. Judge announced his candidacy for the Paddington North division in which he was supported by the local Liberal association. With 1,043 votes he came bottom of the poll and resigned his seat on the Board stating that the electors had not expressed their confidence in him and so he could not remain.Minutes, Metropolitan Board of Works, January 1889. Later life In later life, Judge took up some other causes including the expansion of higher education (he founded the University Extension Guild in 1903). In 1905 he established the 'British Constitutional Association' (it became the 'British Constitution Association' two years later) which organised lecture meetings on broadly socially progressive topics; although not formally linked to the Liberal Party. During the First World War, the Association made a strong attack on the sale of honours through a petition presented by Lord Parmoor to the House of Lords. Judge also kept up correspondence with The Times on sanitary issues. He was Chairman of the Committee on War Damage from 1915. During his last decade he suffered from prolonged ill health.

It included the neighbourhoods of Leyton, Leytonstone and Cann Hall. It was suburban to London, forming part of the London postal district and Metropolitan Police District. It now forms the southernmost part of the London Borough of Waltham Forest in Greater London. Background Leyton St Mary or Low Leyton (sometimes spelt \\"Layton\\") was an ancient parish in the Becontree hundred of Essex, England. Originally, the parish had an area of 2,271 acres (919 hectares), which included a detached part to the north of 588 acres (238 hectares), separated from the main part of the parish by a long, narrow exclave of Walthamstow, known as the Walthamstow Slip. To the south, the parish of Wanstead formed a long protrusion known as the Wanstead Slip, which extended to the marshes of the River Lea and divided Leyton from West Ham. Much of the early governance of the parish was in the hands of the lords of the manors of Leyton and Ruckholt, who held courts baron, a type of manorial court from the medieval period until the 1840s. The lords and their courts appointed public officers such as constables (from 1381), marsh haywards, ale tasters (from 1509), headboroughs (from 1578), tithingmen (from 1584) and a poundkeeper in 1796. They also decided rights of common, who was liable for maintaining roads and bridges, and for making and maintaining infrastructure such as animal pounds, lock ups and stocks. The vestry From the 17th century, the local government of Leyton was increasingly controlled by the parish vestry, particularly with regard to the administration of the Poor Laws and levying of the parish rates. Initially only meeting once a year at Easter to elect and appoint parish officers, a second meeting each year was necessary by 1681, a third meeting from 1698 and monthly from 1759. Although the main Easter meeting was held in the parish church vestry room, other meetings were held in pubs or coffee houses, the committee members being entitled to a generous entertainment allowance of 40 shillings twice a year, although this was halved in 1723. Originally the meetings were presided over by the lord of the manor of Ruckholt, until 1695 when the Vicar of Leyton took on that role. A parish clerk is first mentioned in 1623. The parish appointed a parish beadle from 1718 and two overseers of the poor by 1721, one for Leyton and one for Leytonstone. The parish of Leyton endowed eight alms houses in Church Road and in 1742, built a work house immediately behind them. The work house was closed in 1836, Leyton having joined, along with neighbouring parishes, the West Ham Poor Law Union. The Union built a new work house in Leyton to serve the whole area in 1839-41, the building eventually becoming Langthorne Hospital. A workhouse infirmary built at Whipps Cross in 1900-03 later became Whipps Cross Hospital. There were two constables, one for Leyton and one for Leytonstone; both were appointed by the vestry from 1733. There was a whipping post at Leyton, replaced by a new one in 1756 when the stocks were also replaced, There was also a watch house and \\"cage\\" or lock-up. Leytonstone also had stocks and a watch house; a cage was built at Harrow Green in 1812. The parish of Leyton was incorporated into the Metropolitan Police District in 1840. Urban District Council Through house building and construction of the railway the parish expanded as an extra-metropolitan suburb of London. The parish authorities resisted earlier attempts to form a local board of health, but finally adopted the Public Health Act 1872 for the parish of Leyton and Walthamstow Slip, creating a local government district in 1873. It was extended to include part of the parish of Wanstead to the south, known as Wanstead Slip or Cann Hall, from 1875. (viewable as a download) The board of the new district met in the vestry room until 1882, when new public offices were in Leyton High Road to the design of J Knight. Leyton became an urban district in 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894. The portion of Wanstead in the district was reconstituted as a new parish of Cann Hall. Initially there were four wards in the district, but in 1903 it was reorganised into nine wards and then ten in 1920. A town hall was built for the urban district in 1895-96 next to the 1882 offices, which had proved to be too small and were converted into a public library. Designed by John Johnson (died 1920), Leyton Town Hall was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"Fussy but enjoyable, in an eclectic and enriched Italianate style\\". Amongst the infrastructure improvements initiated by the board was the Leyton Urban District Council Tramways; tram services in Leyton remained in local government control until they became the responsibility of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933. Municipal Borough After a formal petition to the Privy Council in 1920, the urban district was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1926. Each of the existing ten wards was represented by one alderman and three councillors. The first mayor of the new borough was James Benjamin Slade, who was knighted in 1927. =Borough arms= The coat of arms of the municipal borough were granted on 27 November 1926. The arms were described as \\"Or three Chevronels Gules on a Chief Gules a Lion passant Or\\". The crest was: \\"On a Wreath Or and Gules a Lion rampant per pale Or and Sable supporting a Crozier Gold\\". The Latin language motto was \\"MINISTRANDO DIGNITAS\\" meaning \\"dignity in service\\". Elements of the arms commemorated various families who had held manors within the borough during the Middle Ages, and also the nearby Stratford Langthorne Abbey which had held lands in Leyton before the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The lion and cross-staff on the crest of the Leyton arms have been preserved in the arms of the London Borough of Waltham Forest, which were granted on 1 January 1965. Abolition In 1965 the municipal borough was abolished by the London Government Act 1963 and its former area transferred to Greater London from Essex. Its former area was combined with that of the Municipal Borough of Chingford and the Municipal Borough of Walthamstow to form the present-day London Borough of Waltham Forest. The last Mayor of Leyton was Terence Charles Messenger.

It was within the London suburbs, forming part of the London postal district and Metropolitan Police District. Its former area now corresponds to the central part of the London Borough of Waltham Forest in Greater London. Background and formation The ancient parish of Walthamstow formed part of the Becontree hundred of Essex. It was grouped into the West Ham poor law union in 1837 and included in the Metropolitan Police District in 1840. The Public Health Act 1872 would have transferred sewerage and sanitary powers from the Walthamstow Vestry to the West Ham Board of Guardians. To avoid this, the parish adopted the Local Government Act 1858 in 1873 and was constituted as a local board district, governed by a local board, replacing the vestry, and special drainage district that had been created in 1868 for the southeast of the parish. The local board became the urban sanitary authority in 1875. Under the Local Government Act 1894 it became an urban district, governed by Walthamstow Urban District Council. Geography The parish of Walthamstow included a long and narrow exclave of 98 acres in Leyton known as \\"Walthamstow Slip\\". It became part of the Leyton local government district in 1873 when a local board was created and was merged with the Leyton civil parish on 1 December 1877. Incorporation The incorporation of the parish of Walthamstow as a municipal borough was publicly discussed in 1892 (the population at the 1891 census was 46,346). In 1907 and 1908 the possibility of transfer to the County of London was considered by Walthamstow Urban District Council, which would have converted the urban district into a metropolitan borough (1911 population was 124,580). After the First World War the Walthamstow Guardian led a campaign to have the district incorporated and a petition was submitted to the privy council in 1920. The decision was delayed until 1926 by the Royal Commission on London Government. The council had been supplying electricity to the district since 1895 and during the General Strike of 1926 cut off the supply to factories. Following the strike, the council was found to be in neglect of duty and this led to the delay of the official grant of borough status until 1929. The charter of incorporation was presented by James Henry Thomas, Lord Privy Seal. The first mayor was Sir Courtenay Warner. Civic works and services There was a burial board from 1870 to 1896, when the functions were absorbed by Walthamstow Urban District Council. There was a Walthamstow School Board from 1880 to 1903 responsible for elementary education. Following the Education Act 1902 this power was transferred to Essex County Council. However, as the population of Walthamstow was high enough, it was permitted to take over responsibility from the school board for elementary education. This right continued after the Education Act 1944. The borough ran its own tram services until they became the responsibility of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933.Reed, J., London Tramways, (1997) Walthamstow Town Hall was built on Orford Road in 1876. A new Town Hall was built in Forest Road in 1941. Abolition Walthamstow formed part of the review area of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. The report of the commission proposed that Walthamstow should be combined with Chingford to form one of 52 boroughs in Greater London. Following the London Government Act 1963 in 1965 the borough was abolished and transferred from Essex to Greater London. It was combined with the former boroughs of Chingford and Leyton to form the present-day Waltham Forest, one of 32 London boroughs.

History Twickenham Local Government District was formed in 1868, when the civil parish of Twickenham adopted the Local Government Act 1858. The district was governed by a local board of 27 members.Twickenham: Local Government, Victoria County History of Middlesex, Vol. 3 (British History Online), accessed January 28, 2008 The Local Government Act 1894 reconstituted the area of the local board as Twickenham Urban District. Twickenham Urban District Council (UDC), consisting of 24 councillors representing 4 wards, replaced the local board. In 1926 Twickenham was granted a charter of incorporation to become a municipal borough. The borough council consisted of a mayor, 8 aldermen and 24 councillors, and was divided into 8 wards. In 1934 the borough was extended by a county review order: the urban districts of Hampton, Hampton Wick and Teddington were all absorbed by Twickenham. The borough council was increased in size with 10 aldermen and 30 councillors representing 10 wards. The number of wards was later increased to 11. The local board met in rented rooms until 1881, when it moved to Queen's Hall in King Street. In 1924 Twickenham UDC purchased the historic York House, and after restoration this became the offices for the borough. The borough was abolished in 1965 with the creation of Greater London. It became part of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, along with the Municipal Borough of Barnes and the Municipal Borough of Richmond, both from Surrey. However, York House, which had previously been Twickenham's town hall, would become the municipal headquarters of the new borough. Coat of arms Incorporated was the tower of the church at Twickenham, a surviving medieval building in the town The Twickenham Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms by the College of Arms in 1913. The name \\"Twickenham\\" means two ways (roads) settlement or two-farm settlement, and the main device on the shield was a green pall or Y-shaped figure to illustrate the first reading which also resembles the arms of Diocese of Canterbury, which had historical links with the area. At the top of the shield was an antique lamp for literature, arts and sciences. At the dexter side were crossed swords, the emblem of the arms of the Diocese of London. These represented Twickenham's first appearance in historical records where Waldhere, Bishop of London was granted land in AD 704. The three red roses came from the arms of William of Wykeham (d. 1404) who had built the tower of the parish church of St Mary. The crest above the shield was a swan on water with an eel in its beak. This represented the River Thames, a long boundary of the town for three miles (5 km). The eel was for Eel Pie Island.Official Guide of Twickenham UDC, quoted in W C Scott-Giles, Civic Heraldry of England and Wales, 2nd edition, London, 1953 The municipal borough inherited the arms in 1926 and were unaltered when the borough was extended in 1934.

Veneers can improve the aesthetics of a smile and protect the tooth's surface from damage. There are two main types of material used to fabricate a veneer: composite and dental porcelain. A composite veneer may be directly placed (built-up in the mouth), or indirectly fabricated by a dental technician in a dental lab, and later bonded to the tooth, typically using a resin cement. Usually used for treatment of adolescent patients who will require a more permanent design once they are fully grown. The lifespan of a composite veneer is approximately 4 years. In contrast, a porcelain veneer may only be indirectly fabricated. A full veneer crown is described as \\"a restoration that covers all the coronal tooth surfaces (Mesial, Distal, Facial, Lingual and Occlusal)\\". Laminate veneer, on the other hand, is a thin layer that covers only the surface of the tooth and generally used for aesthetic purposes. These typically have better performance and aesthetics and are less plaque retentive. Medical uses Veneers are a prosthetic device, by prescription only, used by the cosmetic dentist. A dentist may use one veneer to restore a single tooth or veneer with high quality that may have been fractured or discolored, or in most cases multiple teeth on the upper arch to create a big bright \\"Hollywood\\" type of smile makeover. Many people have small teeth resulting in spaces that may not be easily closed by orthodontics. Some people have worn away the edges of their teeth resulting in a prematurely aged appearance, while others may have malpositioned tooth/teeth that appear crooked. Multiple veneers can close these spaces, lengthen teeth that have been shortened by wear, fill the black triangles between teeth caused by gum recession, provide a uniform color, shape, and symmetry, and make the teeth appear straight.ELHAMID A., AAZZAB B. Les facettes en c√©ramique : de l'indication √† l'utilisation Le courrier du dentiste Dentists also recommend using thin porcelain veneers to strengthen worn teeth. It is also applied to yellow teeth that won't whiten. Thin veneers are an effective option for aging patients with worn dentition. In many cases, minimal to no tooth preparation is needed when using porcelain veneers. When preparing, in between prep and fit appointments of the veneer, you can make temporaries, usually out of composite. These are not normally indicated but can be used if the patient is complaining of sensitivity or aesthetics. According to a leading Beverly Hills Cosmetic Dentist, temporaries are really important to design and finalize the aesthetics of the final veneers. Temporaries help patients and the dentist decide on the right color, length and shape of the veneers.  Indications  Discoloured teeth, malformed teeth, enamel hypoplasia (not enough enamel), enamel hypocalcification (enamel not fully mineralised), fluorosis, tetracycline staining, non-vital tooth discolouration, malposition, enamel fractures, enamel loss by erosion, modify shape of tooth.  Contraindications  In a controversial opinion, Dr. Michael Zuk, a Canadian DDS, profiles in his opinion and problems of overuse of porcelain veneers by certain cosmetic dentists in 'Confessions of a Former Cosmetic Dentist'. He suggests that the use of veneers for 'instant orthodontics' or simulated straightening of the teeth can be harmful, especially for younger people with healthy teeth. Leading dentists caution that minor superficial damage or normal wear to the teeth is not justification for porcelain or ceramic veneers. This is because the preparation needed to apply a veneer may in some cases destroy 3‚Äì30% of the tooth's surface if performed by an inexperienced dentist. It has been found that after 10 years, 50% of veneers are either displaced, need re-treatment, or are no longer in satisfactory condition.Leading dentists question widespread use of porcelain crowns and veneers Very few experienced cosmetic dentists question widespread use of porcelain crowns and veneers Some cosmetic dentists may push unnecessarily for prosthodontic treatment in adolescents or young to middle- aged adults who have otherwise healthy teeth that only necessitate whitening or more routine cleaning. As preparation for veneers requires shaving down the tooth in some cases, sensitivity and decay may become a problem if this procedure is not properly performed. In addition, a veneer's maintenance cost can also be prohibitive for many individuals. Veneer placement should be limited to individuals with significant aesthetic problems, such as badly cracked or broken teeth, that do not meet the requirements for a crown or full replacement. Additional contraindications include but are not limited to the following: poor oral hygiene, uncontrolled gingival disease, high caries rate, parafunction, no enamel, unreasonable patient expectations, large existing restorations. Classification There are different types of classification for veneers. One of the recently suggested veneer classification (2012) is called Nankali Veneer Classification and divides the veneers as follows: * Labial Surface Coverage ::a) No incisal involvement ::b) Feathered incisal edge ::c) Incisal overlap * Interproximal preparations ::a) No contact point involvement ::b) Contact point level ::c) Passed contact point * Methods of production ::a) Indirect veneers ::b) Direct veneers * Materials ::a) Ceramic ::b) Lithium disilicate (very thin and relatively very strong porcelain) ::c) Da Vinci (Very thin porcelain) ::d) Mac (High resistance to stains and relatively strong) ::e) Acrylic (No longer in use for quality work) ::f) Composite ::g) Nano Ceramic  Types of veneer preparations  There are four basic preparation designs for porcelain laminate veneers; a) Window b) Feather c) Bevel d) Incisal Overlap Recent technological advances have been made, which allow the construction of ultra-thin porcelain laminate veneers. These veneers require only very modest, or in some instances, no reduction of the tooth structure. There are often referred to as \\"non-prep\\" veneers.  Current Veneer Technologies  a) Lumineers b) Smile Infinity¬Æ Alternatives In the past, the only way to correct dental imperfections was to cover the tooth with a crown. Today, in most cases, there are several possibilities from which to pick: crown, composite resin bonding, cosmetic contouring or orthodontics. Non-permanent dental veneers, which are molded to existing teeth, are a feasible option as well. These dental veneers are removable and reusable, and are made from a flexible resin material. Do-it-yourself kits are available for the impression-taking process, and then the actual veneers are made in a lab and sent to the wearer through the mail. History Veneers were invented by California dentist Charles Pincus in 1928 to be used for a film shoot for temporarily changing the appearance of actors' teeth.Pincus CL.\\"Building mouth personality\\" A paper presented at: California State Dental Association;1937:San Jose, California Later, in 1937 he fabricated acrylic veneers to be retained by denture adhesive, which were only cemented temporarily because there was very little adhesion. The introduction of etching in 1959 by Dr. Michael Buonocore aimed to follow a line of investigation of bonding porcelain veneers to etched enamel. Research in 1982 by Simonsen and CalamiaSimonsen R.J. and Calamia John R. \\"Tensile Bond Strengths of Etched Porcelain\\", Journal of Dental Research, Vol. 62, March 1983, Abstract #1099. revealed that porcelain could be etched with hydrofluoric acid, and bond strengths could be achieved between composite resins and porcelain that were predicted to be able to hold porcelain veneers on to the surface of a tooth permanently. This was confirmed by CalamiaCalamia John R. \\"Etched Porcelain Facial Veneers: A New Treatment Modality Based on Scientific and Clinical Evidence\\", New York Journal of Dentistry, Vol. 53, #6, Sept./Oct. 1983, pp.255-259. in an article describing a technique for fabrication, and placement of Etched Bonded Porcelain Veneers using a refractory model technique and HornHorn HR. \\"A new lamination, porcelain bonded to enamel\\".

The area had before 1904 been part of the Staines Rural District created in 1895 and, in turn, its sanitary district forebear. In 1930, the parent district was abolished so two similar-sized parishes: East Bedfont (including its tall-hat-shaped Hatton northern part) and Hanworth to the south-west were added.

The two black palets represent railway lines and indicate Feltham's importance in the southern portion of the British Railways system. (See Feltham marshalling yard). The rose stands for the Tudor associations of Hanworth, particularly the claim that Elizabeth I spent much of her early childhood at Hanworth Manor. The peacock represents the topiary peacocks in the grounds of St Mary's Church, Bedfont, which are accepted as local emblems. The winged sword stands for London Airport and the district's close association with the aircraft industry. The sword also refers to the Royal Army Ordnance Depot, and to the ancient sword-mill marked on a 17th-century map. The gunstones also allude to the R.A.O.C. Depot, and to the powder mills which formerly existed in the Crane Valley.

Description Wiencke Island is located between Anvers Island and the Antarctic Peninsula The rocky island is mostly covered by glaciers, snow and ice. Some small rocky beaches lie on the western and northern sides of the island. There, some grasses, moss and lichens can be found. There are three mountain ridges, with Nemo Peak, high, to the north-west; Nipple Peak to the north-east; and Luigi Peak, high, to the south-west. Luigi Peak is the island's summit, despite it never having been completely surveyed. Wiencke's northernmost point is Cape Astrup, a bold, dark-colored bluff discovered by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition, 1897-99\\\\. It was named by Adrien de Gerlache for Eivind Astrup, Norwegian Arctic explorer and member of Robert Peary's expeditions to Greenland in 1891‚Äì92 and 1893‚Äì95. The very southeast end of the island is Principal Point, a prominent ice-covered headland lying 4 nautical miles (7 km) east of Cape Errera. Principal Point was first charted by the French Antarctic Expedition under Charcot, 1903-05\\\\. The name, applied by the Argentine Antarctic Expedition, 1953‚Äì54, suggests the prominence of the feature. Nearby on the southeast coast is Pursuit Point, an Important Bird Area. Wiencke is surrounded by minor islands, such as Breakwater Island, high, north of Cape Astrup. Near the south-east side is Fridtjof Island, high, connected to Wiencke by a chain of small rocks and islets. In the vicinity of Cape Willems, the south-easternmost extremity of Wiencke, are the Bob Islands, three in number, of volcanic origin, up to high. History19th century= The island seems to have been discovered first by Edward Bransfield on board the brig Williams in January 1820, though he named it a cape. In 1829 Henry Foster (scientist) sailed around the island. In 1873 the German Eduard Dallmann was the first to land on the island, and reported it 'a lonely place'. The island was named by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition, 1897‚Äì99, under Adrien de Gerlache, for Carl August Wiencke, a Norwegian seaman who fell overboard and lost his life on the expedition. =20th century= Britain set up bases on Deception and in a bay of Wiencke Island in 1944 and another at Hope Bay in 1945, to do weather reporting and to check that there was no German naval activity. Only one of these three bases remains, on Goudier Island in the bay of Port Lockroy, off Jougla Point, near Wiencke Island's south-western end. An Argentinean light tower was installed in 1947 at Py Point at the southwest end of the Peltier Channel on nearby Doumer Island, and a refuge hut erected in Dorian Bay in 1957, north of Port Lockroy. British Antarctic Survey (BAS) erected a staging hut, known as the Damoy Point refuge, near this Argentinean refuge in 1975 to act as a base for a temporary summer aircraft ice-strip. This was taken out of use in 1995, and stands restored as a historic site. Another scientific station (Yelcho) was established in 1962 by the Chilean Navy in South Bay on nearby Doumer Island. An emergency shelter was built in 1957 in Alice Creek 150 m south of Goudier Island on the east coast of the island, followed two years later by a larger hut, for use when maintaining a low-frequency electromagnetic aerial and remote receiving equipment. These two huts were removed in 1996 when derelict while Base 'A' on Goudier Island was restored.

The settlement's historical buildings are mostly built of local limestone and date to the second half of the 19th century. A sizeable collection of these are owned and managed by the National Trust of Australia. A remarkable feature of the Greenough Flats is its windswept trees, some of which are bent 90 degrees due to the prevailing coastal winds. The mouth of the Greenough River is about 10 km to the north of the town.  History  Aboriginal = The fertile land was once the home of the Yamatji people, who lived a fairly sedentary life and subsisted on fish and water fowl from the river mouth, shell-fish from the coast and game from the hills. They also cultivated ajeca, a yam-like plant on the river flats. A popular camping ground was what is now known as \\"The Bootenal Springs\\". It is a permanent source of water and became a place of conflict between the Aboriginal people and the first European settlers. Although no evidence of the conflict remains, the site has since been interpreted to remind people of what took place. = European = The area was first explored by George Edward Grey in 1839, after which he named the area after Sir George Bellas Greenough, the president of the Royal Geographical Society in London. Grey claimed that the area could become \\"the granary of Western Australia\\". In 1851 Augustus Gregory surveyed 30,000 acres (120 km¬≤) of land in the region which became known as the Greenough Flats. That was subdivided into 20- and lots with the view to encouraging English settlers who would be more used to the relatively small (by Australian standards) farm sizes. Within a few years, it had developed into a highly successful wheat growing area with a population of over 1,000. Several community centres were created, notably North Greenough, Central Greenough (initially focused on Company Road between Gray's Store and the Hampton Arms Hotel), South Greenough and Bookara. A series of disasters starting with a major cyclone in 1872 and major flooding in 1888, as well as the discovery of gold in the goldfields, caused the gradual decline and abandonment of the settlement so that by 1900 many of the settlers had left the area, their small farmlets becoming incorporated into larger farming properties. Substantial stone buildings, erected by the early colonists in anticipation of population growth, were underutilised or abandoned. During the course of the 20th century many of these buildings became derelict or fell into ruin. In the years after World War II, motorized transport, television and decline in religious observance caused local institutions to lose their relevance, resulting in the closure of local schools, churches, the Presentation Convent, and police complex. In 2016 the Anglican and Catholic Churches in Central Greenough were the only community institutions established in the 19th century that continued to have an active membership. The Hampton Arms also continues to provide for the social needs of the community. Following World War II, the historic heritage value of the Greenough Flats gradually came to be recognised. In 1966 the Geraldton Historical Society opened the first local history museum in the Mid West, in the former Maley family homestead at North Greenough. Soon after, the National Trust of Western Australia carried out a survey of heritage places in the region; the work was led by architect and planner Margaret Feilman. The National Trust also began acquiring historic properties on the Greenough Flats, many of which were gifted, with the object of ensuring their conservation. Almost the entire hamlet at Central Greenough was acquired, as well as nearby Clinch's Mill and the miller's residence, Greenough Hotel, Gray's Store, the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, Temperance Lodge (ruin) and the Anglican Chapel at South Greenough. In the decades that followed, the National Trust invested substantial funds in these places' conservation, work which included the preparation of conservation management plans and archaeological research. The \\"Greenough Hamlet\\" has subsequently become a significant heritage tourism destination in the mid-west region. A new Visitor Information Centre was developed at the Greenough Hamlet around 2000. In 1993, Greenough made national news headlines when a woman and her three young children of this small community were murdered. The killing later featured on the Australian television show Crime Investigation Australia. On 16 February 1999, a rare annular solar eclipse of magnitude 0.9906 was visible from the area. In 2006, floodwaters on the Greenough River undermined and caused the collapse of one of the stone pylons of Maley's bridge in Central Greenough. The bridge, which is both historically significant and important for local vehicular movement, was subsequently restored. In 2013, a disastrous fire gutted Maley's mill and store, one of Greenough's more significant heritage buildings.

He employed a flamboyant preaching style that was considered highly effective in furthering the interests of the Puritan cause. From a radically Protestant family of Cornwall, England, though of part Dutch origin, Peters emigrated to a Puritan colony in America, where he first rose to prominence. After spending time in Holland, he returned to England and became a close associate and propagandist for Oliver Cromwell. Peters may have been the first to propose the trial and execution of Charles I and was believed to have assisted at the beheading. Peters unsuccessfully proposed revolutionary changes that would have disestablished the Church of England's role in landholding and strike at the heart of the legal title to property. Disagreeing with the war against Protestant Holland and increasingly excluded after Cromwell's death, Peters's former outspokenness meant he faced reprisal following the Restoration and he was put to death as a regicide. Early life Peters was born to a father from Antwerp and was of an affluent background. Peters was baptized on 29 June 1598 in Fowey and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. Having experienced conversion, he preached in Essex; returning to London, he took Anglican orders and was appointed lecturer at St Sepulchre's. He entertained, however, Puritan opinions and eventually left England for Holland. He visited Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in Germany in about 1632 and, afterwards, became the minister of the English church at Rotterdam. Here, his Puritan leanings again attracted attention, and Peter made a further move to New England. He was connected with John Winthrop through his wife, and had already formed several friendships with the American colonists.Elizabeth, Peter's first wife connected him with the Winthrop family, for Elizabeth's first husband, Edmund Read, was father of a daughter Elizabeth who was the wife of John Winthrop the younger . He arrived at Boston in October 1635 and was given charge of the church at Salem. He played a significant role during the 1637 trial of Anne Hutchinson during the Antinomian Controversy, being one of the ministers wanting her banished from the colony. He took a leading part in the affairs of the colony, and interested himself in the founding of the new colony in Connecticut. He was also active in the establishment of Harvard College.Spencer, Charles, Killers of the King Civil War period In 1641, Peters returned to England as agent of the colony, but soon became involved in the political troubles which now began. He became chaplain to the forces of the adventurers in Ireland, and served in 1642 in Lord Forbes's expedition, of which he wrote an account. On his return he took a violent part in the campaign against William Laud, and defended the doctrines of the Independents in a preface to a tract by Richard Mather entitled \\"Church Government and Church Covenant discussed ...\\" (1643). In September 1643 the Parliamentary Committee of Safety employed Peter on a mission to Holland, there to borrow money on behalf of Parliament, and to explain the justice of its cause to the Dutch. cite Cal. Clarendon Papers, i. 244. He was more valuable to the Parliamentary cause as a preacher than as a diplomat, and his sermons were very effective in winning recruits to the parliamentary army. cites Edwards, Gangr√¶na, iii. 77. He also became famous as an exhorter at the executions of state criminals, attended Richard Challoner on the scaffold, and improved the opportunity when Sir John Hotham was beheaded. cites Rushworth, v. 328, 804. But it was as an army chaplain that Peter exerted the widest influence. In May 1644 he accompanied the Earl of Warwick in his naval expedition for the relief of Lyme, preached a thanksgiving sermon in the church there after its accomplishment, and was commissioned by Warwick to represent the state of the west and the needs of the forces there to the attention of Parliament. cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1644, pp. 266, 271. This was the prelude to greater services of the same nature rendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax and the New Model Army. As chaplain, Peters took a prominent part in the campaigns of that army during 1645 and 1646. Whenever a town was to be assaulted, it was his business to preach a preparatory sermon to the storming parties, and at Bridgwater, Bristol, and Dartmouth his eloquence was credited with inspiring the soldiers. cites Sprigge, Anglia Rediviva, pp. 77, 102, 180; Vicars, Burning Bush, 1646, p. 198. After a victory he was equally effective in persuading the populace of the justice of the parliamentary arms, and in converting neutrals into supporters. During the siege of Bristol he made converts of five thousand clubmen, and when Fairfax's army entered Cornwall, his despatches specially mentioned the usefulness of Peters in persuading his countrymen to submission. cites Sprigge, p. 229; Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1645‚Äì1647, p. 128; Master Peter's Message from Sir Thomas Fairfax, 4to, 1645. In addition to his duties as a chaplain, Peters exercised the functions of a confidential agent of the general and of a war correspondent. Fairfax habitually employed him to represent to Parliament the condition of his army, the motives which determined his movements, and the details of his successes. His relations of battles and sieges were eagerly read, and formed a semi-official supplement to the general's own reports. Oliver Cromwell followed the example of Fairfax, and on his behalf Peters delivered to the House of Commons narratives of the capture of Winchester and the sack of Basing House. cites Sprigge, Anglia Rediviva, pp. 141‚Äì4, 150‚Äì3. It was a fitting tribute to his position and his services that he was selected to preach, on 2 April 1646, the thanksgiving sermon for the recovery of the west before the two houses of parliament. cites \\"God's Doings and Man's Duty\\", 4to, 1646. At the conclusion of the First English Civil War, Peter, though greatly disliked by the Presbyterians and the Scots, had attained great influence as leader of the Independents. In his pamphlet \\"Last Report of the English Wars\\" (1646), he urged religious toleration, an alliance with foreign Protestants, and an active propagation of the gospel. In the dispute between the New Model Army and the Long Parliament he naturally took the side of the former, and after the seizure of the King by the Army in June 1647 had interviews with Charles I at Newmarket and Windsor, in which he favourably impressed the latter, and gave advice upon the best course to pursue. He performed useful services in the Second Civil War, procured guns for the besiegers at the siege of Pembroke, raised troops in the Midlands, and arranged the surrender of the Duke of Hamilton at Uttoxeter. When the Army entered London in 1648 he was one of the few preachers who supported the move and spoke out in support of Pride's Purge. In August 1649 he accompanied Cromwell on his Irish Campaign, and was present at the fall of Wexford, while later he assisted the campaign by superintending from England the despatch to Cromwell of supplies and reinforcements, and was himself destined by Cromwell for a regiment of foot. In 1650 he was appointed chaplain to the Council of State. Through his office he exerted influence on various committees concerned with religious, legal and social reforms. The same year, during the Third Civil War he was in South Wales, endeavouring to bring over the people to the cause, and subsequently was present at the Battle of Worcester in 1651, where afterwards he preached to the victorious Parliamentary soldiers. = Role in trial and execution of Charles I= Peters rode at the head of the force bringing Charles I to London as prisoner, and justified and supported the trial and sentence in sermons. Peters's counsel was important in the inner circle of Cromwell and influenced the highest levels of policy making. According to a witness, Peters had asserted that he was the one who first suggested to Cromwell that the king should be tried and executed.Spencer, Charles, Killers of the King p159-170 He is believed to have been the headman's assistant Spencer, Charles, Killers of the King p159-170 Under the Commonwealth At the conclusion of the war, Peter was appointed one of the preachers at Whitehall and became a person of influence. Parliament had already voted him an annuity of ¬£200; Archbishop Laud's library (or a portion of it) had been handed over to him in 1644. He was one of the committee of twenty-one appointed to suggest legal reforms, and he published his ideas on this subject, which included a register of wills and land titles and the destruction afterwards of the ancient records, in his tract, \\"Good Work for a Good Magistrate\\" (in 1651), answered by R Vaughan and Prynne. He strongly disapproved of the First Anglo-Dutch War, and his influence suffered. In July 1658 he was sent to Dunkirk as chaplain garrison. He preached the funeral sermon on Cromwell, and opposed the removal of Richard Cromwell. In 1647 Peter called for the readmission of the Jews to England, believing this would benefit the economy and hasten the second coming. On account of his views on the admission of the Jews, Cromwell invited him to the Whitehall Conference of 1655 to support his case. At the conference Peter changed sides, expressing the opinion that not only could the Jews could not be converted, but they might do harm through missionary work.Scult, Mel (1978). Millennial Expectations and Jewish Liberties: A Study of the Efforts to Convert the Jews in Britain, Up to the Mid Nineteenth Century. Brill Archive. pps.25. Restoration and Stuart retribution The country became unstable and factional after Cromwell's son fell from power, and General Monck came from Scotland leading the only effective and unified force left. Peters attempted to secure his position with the new power in the land and met Monck at St Albans on the latter's march to London, but met with no favour, being expelled from his lodgings at Whitehall in January 1660. Monck's restoration of the house of Stuart placed Peters in serious danger. On 11 May his arrest was ordered. On 17 May the Library of the Archbishop of Canterbury was taken from him.\\"the Library of the late Archbishop of Canterbury, and now, or lately, in the Hands of Mr. Hugh Peters, be forthwith secured\\". He was excepted from the Act of Indemnity and apprehended on September 2 in Southwark. Peters's preaching and addresses to Parliament on Cromwell's behalf had made him too well known as a Puritan opponent of the royal house of Stuart for any disavowals to save him, and repentance was probably his best hope. It would also prevent his property being forfeited and leave something for his heirs. However he appeared to have panicked, sending a defence of himself to the House of Lords in which he denied any share in the death of Charles I. In addition to justifying Charles being condemned to death, Peters was thought to be one of the two heavily disguised executioners, even the one who welded the axe, though this was a task requiring some skill. The headsman's assistant had held up the severed head to spectators, and contemptuously thrown it aside afterward, but he omitted the usual pronouncement 'This is the head of a traitor'; as a leading preacher Peters's voice would have been easily recognized. According to witness testimony Peters had ordered a carpenter to drive staples into the scaffold (for tying Charles to the block if he resisted), been present at the scene on the day of the execution, disappeared for an hour during it, and was seen drinking water with the presumed headsman, Richard Brandon, afterwards.Spencer, Charles, Killers of the King p159-170 He was tried on 13 October and found guilty of high treason. Peters wrote \\"A Dying Father's Last Legacy\\" to his only child, Elizabeth, in which he gave a narrative of his career. Spencer, Charles, Killers of the King p159-170 =Execution= He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, the execution took place at Charing Cross on 16 October. Many contemporaries reported him as being in despair. Peters was forced to watch John Cook suffering emasculation and disembowelment before enduring the same fate himself.Spencer, Charles, Killers of the King p159-170 Bibliography Hugh Peters was the author of the following pamphlets: # \\"The Advice of that Worthy Commander Sir Edward Harwood upon occasion of the French King's Preparations ‚Ä¶ Also a relation of his life and death\\" (the relation is by Peters), 4to, 1642; reprinted in the Harleian Miscellany, ed.

There are also attributed to Peters: # \\"The Nonesuch Charles his character\\", 8vo, 1651.

A note in the copy of the latter in Thomason's Collection in the British Museum, says: \\"I believe this pamphlet was made by Mr. Hugh Peters, who hath a man named Cornelius Glover\\". Character assessment In the opinion of the anonymous author of Peter's biography article in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 11th ed (1911) his death was viewed with greater rejoicings than perhaps attended that of any of the regicides, as he had incurred great unpopularity by his unrestrained speech and extreme activity in the cause. He is said to have been a man of a rough, coarse nature, without tact or refinement, of strong animal spirits, undeterred by difficulties which beset men of higher mental capacity, whose energies often outran his discretion, intent upon the realities of life and the practical side of religion. In the opinion of the anonymous author of the 1911 biography article, his conception of religious controversy, that all differences could be avoided if ministers could only pray together and live together, is highly characteristic, and shows the largeness of his personal sympathies and at the same time the limits of his intellectual imagination. In his Dictionary of National Biography article (1896) on Peter, the historian C. H. Firth was of the opinion that his popular hatred was hardly deserved. Peter had earned it by what he said rather than by what he did. His public-spirited exertions for the general good and his kindnesses to individual royalists were forgotten, and only his denunciations of the king and his attacks on the clergy were remembered. Burnet characterises him as \\"an enthusiastical buffoon preacher, though a very vicious man, who had been of great use to Cromwell, and had been very outrageous in pressing the king's death with the cruelty and rudeness of an inquisitor\\", Burnet, Own Time, ed. 1833, i. 290. His jocularity had given as much offence as his violence, and pamphlets were compiled which related his sayings and attributed to him a number of time-honoured witticisms and practical jokes. cites The Tales and Jests of Mr. Hugh Peters, published by one that formerly hath been conversant with the author in his lifetime, 4to, 1660; Hugh Peters his Figaries, 4to, 1660. His reputation was further assailed in songs and satires charging him with embezzlement, drunkenness, adultery, and other crimes; but these accusations were among the ordinary controversial weapons of the period, and deserve no credit. cites Don Juan Lamberto, 4to, 1661, pt. ii. chap. viii.; Yonge, England's Shame, 8vo, 1663, pp. 14, 19, 27, 53. They rest on no evidence, and were solemnly denied by Peters. In one case the publisher of these libels was obliged to insert a public apology in the newspapers. cites Several Proceedings in Parliament, 2‚Äì9 Sept. 1652. An examination of the career and the writings of Peters shows him to have been an honest, upright, and genial man, whose defects of taste and judgement explain much of the odium which he incurred, but in the opinion of Firth do not justify it. Peter is described as having been tall and thin, according to the tradition recorded by one of his successors at Salem, but his portraits represent a full-faced, and apparently rather corpulent man. cites Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll. 1st ser. vi. 252. A picture of him, described by Cole, as showing \\"rather a well-looking open-countenanced man\\", was formerly in the President's lodge at Queens' College, Cambridge. cites Diary of Thomas Burton, i. 244. One which belonged to the Rev. Dr. Treffry was exhibited in the National Portrait Collection of 1868; notes it was exhibit number 724. the best engraved portrait is that prefixed to \\"A Dying Father's Last Legacy\\", 12mo, 1660. A list of others is given in the catalogue of the portraits in the Sutherland Collection in the Bodleian Library, and many satirical prints and caricatures are described in the British Museum Catalogue of Prints and Drawings. Satires, vol. i. 1870. Catholic historian Hugh Ross Williamson maintained in the 1950sHugh Ross Williamson, Historical Whodunnits (London: Macmillan, 1956) that Peter had actually and surreptitiously assisted at Charles I's execution. This allegation has not been broadly accepted. Family Peter was the son of Thomas Dyckwoode, alias Peters, descended from a family which had left the Netherlands to escape religious persecution, and of Martha, daughter of John Treffry and Emlyn Tresithny of Place, Fowey, Cornwall. In about 1625, while Peter was preaching in Essex, he married Elizabeth, widow of Edmund Read of Wickford, and daughter of Thomas Cooke of Pebmarsh in the same county. cites A Dying Father's Legacy, 1660, p. 99; Bibl. Cornub. iii. 1310 Peter married secondly Deliverance Sheffield; she was still alive in 1677 in New England, and was supported by charity. cites Hutchinson Papers, Prince Soc. ii. 252. By his second marriage Peter had one daughter, Elizabeth, to whom his \\"Last Legacy\\" is addressed. She is said to have married and left descendants in America, but the accuracy of the pedigree is disputed. cites Caulfield, Reprint of the Tales and Jests of Hugh Peters, 1807, p. xiv; Hist. of the Rev.

He was the subject of a 1981 television play A Last Visitor for Mr. Hugh Peter. It showed him the night before his execution, where he is visited by various figures from his past and the future. He was played by Peter Vaughan, Charles Kay played Charles I, Michael Pennington played John Lilburne, and Julia Chambers played his daughter Elizabeth.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476281 IMDB entry See also *List of regicides of Charles I Notes \\\\-------- References  ;Attribution * * Further reading  * * Category:1598 births Category:1660 deaths Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:17th-century English Puritan ministers Category:English independent ministers of the Interregnum (England) Category:People from Fowey Category:Massachusetts colonial-era clergy Category:People of colonial Massachusetts Category:17th-century New England Puritan ministers Category:Executed regicides of Charles I Category:Roundheads Category:English people of Dutch descent ","title":"Hugh Peter"},{"id":"2756055","text":"Spume Island is a small, low, rocky island lying southwest of Bonaparte Point, off the southwest coast of Anvers Island in the Palmer Archipelago of Antarctica.

(fl. 1269), was a 13th-century French scholar who conducted experiments on magnetism and wrote the first extant treatise describing the properties of magnets. His work is particularly noted for containing the earliest detailed discussion of freely pivoting compass needles, a fundamental component of the dry compass soon to appear in medieval navigation.E.

He also wrote a treatise on the construction and use of a universal astrolabe. Peregrinus‚Äô text on the magnet is entitled in many of the manuscripts of it Epistola Petri Peregrini de Maricourt ad Sygerum de Foucaucourt, militem, de magnete (\\"Letter of Peter Peregrinus of Maricourt to Sygerus of Foucaucourt, Soldier, on the Magnet\\") but it is more commonly known by its short title, Epistola de magnete (\\"Letter on the Magnet\\"). The letter is addressed to an otherwise unknown Picard countryman named Sygerus (Sigerus, Ysaerus) of Foucaucourt, possibly a friend and neighbor of the author; Foucaucourt borders on the home area of Peregrinus around Maricourt, in the present-day department of the Somme, near P√©ronne. In only one of the 39 surviving manuscript copies the letter also bears the closing legend Actum in castris in obsidione Luceri√¶ anno domini 1269¬∫ 8¬∫ die augusti (\\"Done in camp during the siege of Lucera, August 8, 1269\\"), which might indicate that Peregrinus was in the army of Charles, duke of Anjou and king of Sicily, who in 1269 laid siege to the city of Lucera. However, given that only one manuscript attests this, the evidence is weak.See Sturlese in Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt, Opera (Pisa, 1995), pp. 16 and 89. There is no indication of why Peter received the sobriquet Peregrinus (or \\"pilgrim\\"), but it suggests that he may have been either a pilgrim at one point or a crusader; and the attack on Lucera of 1269 had been sanctioned as a crusade by the Pope. So Petrus Peregrinus may have served in that army. \\"You must realize, dearest friend,\\" Peregrinus writes, \\"that while the investigator in this subject must understand nature and not be ignorant of the celestial motions, he must also be very diligent in the use of his own hands, so that through the operation of this stone he may show wonderful effects.\\"Jean Gimpel, The Medieval Machine: The Industrial Revolution of the Middle Ages (New York, Penguin, 1976), 194-5. The content of the Epistola de magnete In his letter of 1269,The letter of Petrus Peregrinus on the magnet, A.D. 1269 Translated by Brother Arnold (New York, McGraw Publishing, 1904) (online) Peregrinus explains how to identify the poles of the compasses. He also describes the laws of magnetic attraction and repulsion. The letters also contain a description of an experiment with a repaired magnet, as well as a number of compasses, one of which \\"you will be able to direct your steps to cities and islands and to any place whatever in the world.\\" Indeed, the increasing perfection of magnetic compasses during the thirteenth century allowed navigators such as Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi to strike out on voyages to unknown lands. ; The Epistola de magnete is divided into two parts. Part One (10 chapters): This is a section that serves as a model of inductive reasoning based on definite experiences, and setting forth the fundamental laws of magnetism. He did not discover these laws, but presented them in logical order. Part One discusses the physical (but not the occult) properties of the lodestone and provides the first extant written account of the polarity of magnets. He was thus the first to use the word ‚Äúpole‚Äù in this context. He provides methods for determining the north and south poles of a magnet, and he describes the effects magnets have upon one another, showing that like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each other. He also treats the attraction of iron by lodestones, the magnetization of iron by lodestones, and the ability to reverse the polarity in such an induced magnet. Peregrinus attributed the Earth's magnetism to the action of celestial poles, rather than to the terrestrial poles of the planet itself.Anne Locker, Peter the Pilgrim, IET Communications Engineer, August/September 2006, UK ISSN 1479-8352 Part Two (three chapters): This section describes three devices that utilize the properties of magnets. He treats the practical applications of magnets, describing the ‚Äúwet‚Äù floating compass as an instrument in common use, and proposing a new ‚Äúdry‚Äù pivoted compass in some detail. He also attempts to prove that with the help of magnets it is possible to realize perpetual motion (see History of perpetual motion machines). His device is a toothed wheel which passes near a lodestone so that the teeth are alternately attracted by one pole and repelled by the other. The universal astrolabe text Part of the engraving on the back-side de Maricourt's universal astrolabe The Nova Compositio Astrolabii Particularis (found in only 4 manuscripts) describes the construction and use a universal astrolabe which could be used at a variety of latitudes without changing the plates. Unlike al-ZarqƒÅlƒ´‚Äôs more famous universal astrolabe in which vertical halves the heavens were projected onto a plane through the poles, this one had both the northern and southern hemispheres projected onto a plane through the equator (which was also the limit of projection). There are no known surviving astrolabes based on this treatise. The use of such an astrolabe is very complicated, and since it is probable that most sophisticated users were not frequent travelers, they were more likely happier with the traditional (and simpler) stereographic planispheric astrolabe. Roger Bacon The literature often mentions that Peregrinus was praised by Roger Bacon, who called him a ‚Äúperfect mathematician‚Äù and one who valued experience over argument. But the association of the praise with Peregrinus appears only in a marginal gloss to Bacon‚Äôs Opus tertium and only in one of the five manuscripts used in the critical edition, which leads us to conclude that it was a later comment added by someone else. That Bacon‚Äôs praise was for Peregrinus is open to serious debate.Grant, DSB vol. 10, pp. 532 ff.; Thomson,\\"Peter Peregrinus\\", pp. 388-389. Legacy The influence of Peregrinus' astrolabe was virtually nil. His reputation derives mainly from his work on magnetism. The De magnete became a very popular work from the Middle Ages onwards, as witnessed by the large number of manuscript copies. The first printed edition of it was issued at Augsburg, in 1558, by Achilles Gasser.See Sturlese in Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt, Opera (Pisa, 1995), p. 44. In 1572, Jean Taisner published from the press of Johann Birkmann of Cologne a work entitled Opusculum perpetua memoria dignissimum, de natura magnetis et ejus effectibus, Item de motu continuo. This is considered a piece of plagiarism, as Taisnier presents, as though his own, the Epistola de magnete of Peregrinus and a treatise on the fall of bodies by Gianbattista Benedetti. William Gilbert acknowledged his debt to Peregrinus and incorporated this thirteenth-century scientist's experiments on magnetism into his own treatise, called De magnete.Jean Gimpel, The Medieval Machine: The Industrial Revolution of the Middle Ages (New York, Penguin, 1976), 194. The Epistola de magnete was later issued by Guillaume Libri (Histoire des sciences math√©matiques en Italie, vol 2 [Paris, 1838], pp. 487‚Äì505), but, based on only one manuscript, this edition was full of defects; corrected editions were published by Timoteo Bertelli (in Bulletino di bibliografia e di storia delle scienze matematiche e fisiche pubblicata da B.

They are also used in marquetry. Plywood consists of three or more layers of veneer. Normally, each is glued with its grain at right angles to adjacent layers for strength. Veneer beading is a thin layer of decorative edging placed around objects, such as jewelry boxes. Veneer is also used to replace decorative papers in Wood Veneer HPL. Veneer is also a type of manufactured board.  Background  Veneer is obtained either by \\"peeling\\" the trunk of a tree or by slicing large rectangular blocks of wood known as flitches. The appearance of the grain and figure in wood comes from slicing through the growth rings of a tree and depends upon the angle at which the wood is sliced. There are three main types of veneer-making equipment used commercially: * A rotary lathe in which the wood is turned against a very sharp blade and peeled off in one continuous or semi-continuous roll. Rotary-cut veneer is mainly used for plywood, as the appearance is not desirable because the veneer is cut concentric to the growth rings. * A slicing machine in which the flitch or piece of log is raised and lowered against the blade and slices of the log are made. This yields veneer that looks like sawn pieces of wood, cut across the growth rings; such veneer is referred to as \\"crown cut\\". * A half-round lathe in which the log or piece of log can be turned and moved in such a way as to expose the most interesting parts of the grain, creating a more textured feel and appearance; such veneer is commonly referred to as \\"rift cut.\\" Each slicing processes gives a very distinctive type of grain, depending upon the tree species. In any of the veneer-slicing methods, when the veneer is sliced, a distortion of the grain occurs. As it hits the wood, the knife blade creates a \\"loose\\" side where the cells have been opened up by the blade, and a \\"tight\\" side. Historically veneers were also sawn, but this is more wasteful of wood. Veneering is an ancient art, dating back to at least the ancient Egyptians who used expensive and rare wood veneers over cheaper timbers to produce their furniture and sarcophagi. During the Roman Empire, Romans also used veneered work in mass quantities.  Producing wood veneers  The finest and rarest logs are sent to companies that produce veneer. The advantage to this practice is twofold. First, it provides the most financial gain to the owner of the log. Secondly, and of more importance to the woodworker, it greatly expands the amount of usable wood. While a log used for solid lumber is cut into thick pieces, usually no thinner than 1/8 of an inch (3 mm), veneers are cut as thin as 1/40 of an inch (0.6 mm). Depending on the cutting process used by the veneer manufacturer, very little wood is wasted by the saw blade thickness, known as the saw kerf. Accordingly, the yield of a rare grain pattern or wood type is greatly increased, in turn placing less stress on the resource. Some manufacturers even use a very wide knife to \\"slice off\\" the thin veneer pieces. In this way, none of the wood is wasted. The slices of veneer are always kept in the order in which they are cut from the log and are often sold this way.  Types of veneers  There are a few types of veneers available, each serving a particular purpose. * Raw veneer has no backing on it and can be used with either side facing up. It is important to note that the two sides will appear different when a finish has been applied, due to the cell structure of the wood. * Paper backed veneer is as the name suggests, veneers that are backed with paper. The advantage to this is it is available in large sizes, or sheets, as smaller pieces are joined together prior to adding the backing. This is helpful for users that do not wish to join smaller pieces of raw veneers together. This is also helpful when veneering curves and columns as the veneer is less likely to crack. * Phenolic backed veneer is less common and is used for composite, or artificial wood veneers. Due to concern for the natural resource, this is becoming more popular. It too has the advantage of being available in sheets, and is also less likely to crack when being used on curves. * Laid up veneer is raw veneer that has been joined together to make larger pieces. The process is time-consuming and requires great care, but is not difficult and requires no expensive tools or machinery. Veneers can be ordered through some companies already laid up to any size, shape or design. * Reconstituted veneer is made from fast-growing tropical species. Raw veneer is cut from a log, and dyed if necessary. Once dyed, the sheets are laminated together to form a block. The block is then sliced so that the edges of the laminated veneer become the ‚Äúgrain‚Äù of the reconstituted veneer. * Wood on Wood Also called 2-ply is a decorative wood veneer face with a utility grade wood backer applied at an opposing direction to the face veneer.  Advantages of using veneers  Compared to wood, one of the primary advantages of using veneer is stability. While solid wood can be prone to warping and splitting, because veneer is made of thin layers of wood glued together, the chances of splitting or cracking are reduced. Some projects built using wood veneer would not be possible to construct using solid lumber, owing to expansion and contraction caused by fluctuation of temperature and humidity. Another advantage of veneer is sustainability‚Äîfurniture made with wood veneer uses less wood than the same piece of furniture made with solid wood. Further, veneer may also be more readily available than solid wood as exotic hardwood lumber can be scarce and very expensive.  Ecological characteristics  * Recyclability and renewability: Wood has the least impact on total energy use, greenhouse gases, air and water pollution, solid waste and ecological resource use. Seventy percent less energy is required in the use of wood compared with any other building materials. * Sustainability: Using veneer extends the use of a piece of timber. The wood that might be used in one solid piece a few visible cm wide can cover a far greater area when used as a veneer. * Toxicity: Many veneers are non-toxic, though veneers made of woods like Bubinga and Wenge are toxic, and appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid health problems from dust inhalation, splinters and the like. * Veneer stores carbon and also maximises the use of harvested wood.  Buying veneers  Wood veneers are typically sold by the square foot. With the ability to join veneers, even small pieces are usable, resulting in very little waste. Many sources sell small packets of veneers that are sequence matched and are ideal for small projects. These make experimenting and practicing much more economical. It is also possible to buy plywood and other substrates with veneered faces for larger projects consisting of casework.

It was built on the , but it was acquired in 1845 by the Midland Railway, which also acquired the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway at the same time. Legal and practical difficulties meant that it was some time before through standard gauge trains could run on the line; that only became possible in 1854 with the conversion of most of the line to mixed gauge and the opening of the Tuffley Loop. Even then the station at Gloucester was awkwardly sited, until in 1896 a through station was opened; it later became known as Gloucester Eastgate station. The Tuffley Loop and Eastgate station were closed in 1975. Part of the original line near Bristol was closed in 1970, trains being diverted over the ex-Great Western Railway route through Filton. However, the remainder of the route is in service currently as part of the busy Bristol to Birmingham main line. Earliest railwaysGloucester and Cheltenham Railway= The Bristol and Gloucester Railway in 1844In 1809 the Gloucester and Cheltenham Railway was authorised. In reality it was to be a horse-operated plateway. Cheltenham was growing in importance because of the supposedly health-giving properties of the waters, and houses for well-to-do residents were being built, requiring the bringing in of stone for the building work and for roads, and coal for the residents. There were good- quality quarries already in existence at Leckhampton, high above the town, and Forest of Dean coal was available at Gloucester, nine miles away, brought there on the River Severn and later by canal. The Gloucester and Cheltenham Railway was built to serve these needs, by connecting the docks at Gloucester (under construction) and the Leckhampton quarries, with Cheltenham. The G&CR; was completed in 1811. Although alternatively referred to as a railway, railroad, or tramway, it was in fact a horse-operated plateway of gauge. A steam locomotive was later tried out, but the experiment was a failure because the locomotive was too heavy for the tramplates and broke them.David Bick, The Gloucester & Cheltenham Tramroad and the Leckhampton Quarry Lines, Oakwood Press, Usk, second edition 1987, =Coal tramroads at Bristol= In June 1828 two companies were incorporated by Act of Parliament to build tramways to bring coal from collieries at Shortwood, Parkfield and Coalpit Heath, to the north-east of Bristol, into Bristol itself. One of the companies was the Bristol and Gloucestershire Railway, which was to terminate in Bristol at Cuckold's Pill on the Floating Harbour. The second was the Avon and Gloucestershire Railway, whose terminal was on the River Avon opposite Keynsham, from where river boats would continue the journey. The two lines were to make a junction north of Mangotsfield, near the later Mangotsfield North Junction. The lines were made with cast iron fish-bellied edge rails on stone blocks, and had a track gauge of ; they were single lines worked by horses. The Avon and Gloucestershire Railway was opened in July 1832 together with the part of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Railway north of the point of junction. The south-western part of the Bristol line was opened on 6 August 1835.C G Maggs, The Bristol and Gloucester Railway and the Avon and Gloucestershire Railway, The Oakwood Press, Witney, second edition 1992, , pages 11‚Äì24E G Barnes, The Rise of the Midland Railway, George Allen and Unwin Limited, London, 1966, page 96 onwards =Great Western Railway at Bristol= In 1835 the Great Western Railway was incorporated, to build a trunk railway from London to Bristol. The engineer was Isambard Kingdom Brunel and the line was to be built on the broad gauge and it would use locomotive power. The line was opened progressively, but the portion in Bristol was opened on 31 August 1840, and the line opened throughout from London to Bristol on 30 June 1841. =Birmingham and Gloucester Railway= In the 1836 session of Parliament, interests in Birmingham were promoting the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway; if they could reach Gloucester, then waterborne transport from there to Bristol would give a connection between the two great cities, also giving access to the transatlantic shipping trade at Bristol. It obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 22 April 1836.Colin Maggs, The Birmingham Gloucester Line, Line One Publishing Limited, Cheltenham, 1986, =Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway= Even before the Great Western Railway had been authorised, people in Cheltenham had determined to promote a line from Cheltenham through Gloucester and Stroud to join the planned Great Western Railway near Swindon; accordingly they submitted a Bill for the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway in the 1836 session of Parliament. It was passed on 21 June 1836.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume I: 1833‚Äì1863, part 1, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927, page 162 onward =Between Gloucester and Cheltenham= The proposed alignment of these two proposed lines was almost identical between Gloucester and Cheltenham. Moreover, both companies proposed to acquire the Gloucester and Cheltenham Railway; this was not in order to use its main line route, but because of the access it had acquired to Gloucester Docks. The Gloucester and Cheltenham Railway was purchased for ¬£35,000 by the Birmingham and Gloucester company, which had got its authorising Act first, but by agreement the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway Act set up a sharing of the construction of the new main line between Gloucester and Cheltenham, with the B&GR; building the Gloucester station and the C&GWUR; the Cheltenham station, both companies being able to use both stations, and to share in the use of the tramroad. The Gloucester to Cheltenham main line was to be built in two-halves by the respective companies, each having running powers over the other half. It would be built on the standard gauge, but the C&GWUR; could lay additional rails at its own expense to enable its broad gauge trains to operate.Barnes, page 117 onward In November 1837 the C&GWUR; reported that the condition of the money market was such that they were going to be unable to build all of their line in the foreseeable future, and that they proposed to concentrate on the Swindon end. The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway were alarmed by this as they relied on the C&GWUR; to build part of the shared Gloucester to Cheltenham line. The C&GWUR; needed a Parliamentary Act and the Birmingham company secured clauses enabling them to build the relevant portion themselves if the C&GWUR; did not proceed with the construction in a timely way. This motivated the C&GWUR; to alter its priorities and it let contracts for construction and acquired land at Gloucester for the station. (It had been agreed that the two companies would have separate stations there and at Cheltenham.) Bristol and Gloucester Railway formed The development of railways in Great Britain was gaining momentum, and it soon appeared obvious that a line between Bristol and Gloucester was appropriate. An attempt to get authorisation in the 1838 session of Parliament was unsuccessful, but on 1 July 1839 the Bristol and Gloucester Railway was authorised, to take over and extend the old Bristol and Gloucestershire coal line from Westerleigh to a junction with the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway at Standish. The length of new line was to be about . Because continuity with the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway was foreseen, the track was to be standard gauge.MacDermot, volume I part 1, page 208 onwardColin G Maggs, Gloucestershire Railways, Halsgrove (publisher), Wellington, 2010, Authorised capital was ¬£400,000. The C&GWUR; was now (in November 1839) in serious financial difficulty, and it indicated to the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway that it would be unable to build the agreed part of the line at Gloucester. The Birmingham and Gloucester company decided to go ahead and build this itself, but first it approached the newly authorised Bristol and Gloucester Company, and they agreed to merge and to purchase the C&GWUR; together. A Parliamentary Bill was put forward, but negotiations between the two main companies led to disagreement, and the idea was dropped. The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway went ahead alone with the construction to Gloucester, and it opened there on 4 November 1840.Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Gloucester to Bristol: Midland Main Lines, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2004, By the end of 1841 the C&GWUR; had done nothing tangible to construct its own line north of Kemble, and under pressure from others who relied on it, it obtained an Act in 1842 authorising sale or lease of its undertaking to any of the neighbouring lines, and extension of time for construction and additional capital, requesting the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway to lay broad gauge rails between Gloucester and Cheltenham (at the expense of the C&GWUR;), and enabling the Bristol and Gloucester Railway to make the railway between Standish and Gloucester itself, as a standard gauge line, subject to the C&GWUR; buying that back later if they wished. Negotiations were quickly opened with the Great Western Railway to acquire the C&GWUR;'s line, and after some delay, this was agreed in January 1843. The resources of the GWR would obviously enable them to complete the construction expeditiously. The Bristol and Gloucester now saw that they were to run between the broad gauge GWR at Bristol, and the broad gauge GWR (ex-C&GWUR;) at Standish and Gloucester. Isambard Kingdom Brunel had become the company's engineer (on 12 September 1839), and in April 1843, the Bristol and Gloucester decided to make its line on the broad gauge instead. A connection to the GWR station at Bristol would be made, and the GWR would complete the C&GWUR; Standish to Gloucester line within a year and give the Bristol and Gloucester running powers to Cheltenham. The Bristol and Gloucester was to be given access to the GWR stations at all these places. The arrangement was to last for 20 years for a rent of ¬£18,500, rising by ¬£1,000 after five years. Barnes suggests that the decision was coerced. It is true that if the Bristol and Gloucester Railway had built its line on the narrow gauge it would have been isolated, and the GWR could by-pass it by routeing broad gauge traffic through Swindon and the C&GWUR; line. Nevertheless, the saving in capital on building the Bristol station and other facilities, as well as the avoidance of living in proximity to a hostile GWR, were powerful in persuading the Bristol company to select this option; and Brunel had explained that transshipment of goods at the break of gauge to the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway would be simple: \\"a very simple arrangement may effect the transfer of the entire load of goods from the waggon of one Company to that of the other\\". Passenger transfer would be even simpler: passengers would \\"merely step from one carriage into the other in the same station and on the same platform\\".Quoted in MacDermot, volume I part 1, page 211 MacDermot (citing \\"Gauge Commission evidence\\") states that \\"At this stage, the works were already partly made so that Wickwar and Fishponds Tunnels and several underbridges were in place, built for standard gauge double track,\\" and this is repeated by Christiansen. They are saying that the works were made for a double line standard gauge track; and that the Bristol and Gloucester Railway was opened as a broad gauge line. They do not explain how two broad gauge tracks were squeezed through, and this seems to be a mistake.Maggs says (on page 16 of the Bristol and Gloucester Railway) that \\"Brunel had calculated that an extra foot width from Bristol to Standish would only cost an extra ¬£6,968, and suggested that if the line was to be made broad gauge at a later date, only the masonry of tunnels, bridges and embankments need now be wider, as the rock sides of the tunnel could be widened and in cuttings the open ditches could be replaced by tile drains giving more space.MacDermot, volume I part 1, page 211Christiansen, page 46 Lewis observes that \\"Some structures on the B&GR;, including the Stroudwater Canal Bridge, were only (rather than the more usual on other broad gauge lines) due to the late decision by the B&GR; to conform to the GWR broad gauge.\\"Brian Lewis, Brunel's Timber Bridges and Viaducts, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, 2007, The assertion is contradicted by the evidence of James Edward M'Connell, locomotive superintendent of the Bristol and Birmingham Railway in evidence to the Gauge Commissioners on 11 August 1845: \\"Q: Is the Wickwar tunnel adapted to the broad gauge? A: It is; it was constructed for the broad gauge. Q: Then the broad gauge was determined on before that tunnel was constructed? A: The bridges and tunnels were all made sufficiently large to accommodate the broad gauge, but till that meeting that I allude to [at which the Bristol and Gloucester decided on the broad gauge], it was perfectly understood that it was to be a narrow [i.e. standard] gauge [line], although the bridges and tunnels were made to suit either.\\"Gauge Commissioners' Report: Minutes of Evidence Taken Before the Commissioners, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1846 On 18 June 1842 an Act was passed authorising an additional ¬£200,000 in capital. The Avon and Gloucestershire Railway had its standard gauge fish=bellied rail track between Mangotsfield and Coalpit Heath, and this was preserved by the 1839 Act. When the Bristol and Gloucester Railway was first constructed, the broad gauge track was laid with the standard track inside it, the first example of mixed gauge track in the country, between Mangotsfield and Westerleigh, a distance of about .The title of the first mixed gauge is contested by Williams (on page 37): \\"The Act for the line between Cheltenham and Gloucester called for the rails to be of the same standard gauge as the B&G.; The C&GWU; was a broad gauge line, so the first ever mixed-gauge section was laid between the two towns,\\" but in fact, this opened much later, on 23 October 1847. MacDermot calls it the first important instance on page 185.MacDermot, volume I, part 1, page 218Roy Williams, The Midland Railway: a New History, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1988, The main structure other than the tunnels on the B&GR; was Beard's Mill Viaduct at Stonehouse. It was a timber viaduct designed by Brunel; there were ten main spans of , with two shorter approach spans partly buried in the embankment. It lasted well, being replaced by a brick and iron structure, opened fully on 30 July 1884. There was a span bridge over the Stroudwater Canal just north of the Stonehouse Viaduct; it was laminated timber. Of the 73 bridges on the line, 41 over and 32 under, there were 15 timber bridges. Ten of these were laminated timber beam bridges of span: in the case of the underbridges they had ballasted longitudinal timber track. There were two trussed overbridges, also span; and three laminated beam overbridges of three spans. Opening to traffic The relationship with the GWR Was not entirely harmonious, and a proposed working agreement was not finalised, the B&GR; believing that the price asked by the GWR was excessive. The necessary arrangement was made with Stothert and Slaughter of Bristol to work the line for ten years, and the Bristol and Gloucester Railway opened on 6 July 1844. The opening ceremony involving a journey from Bristol to Gloucester started very late and the engine derailed approaching Gloucester. During the sumptuous banquet that followed, the Chairman of the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, in a speech, remarked that, \\"if the right thing had been done originally, there would have been one line throughout between Birmingham and Bristol, and there would have been no differences about broad gauges and narrow gauges\\". The public opening of the line was on 8 July 1844. The trains used Temple Meads station at Bristol; a half-mile connecting line at Lawrence Hill had been constructed under powers of 27 June 1843. At Gloucester the Birmingham and Gloucester had established a station when it opened on 4 November 1840; it was located in the angle of what is now Station Road and Bruton Way. The Bristol and Gloucester opened a platform on the north side of that, its route curving in from the south and south-east so that the respective routes crossed on the approach to the stations. There were six passenger trains each way daily; from the beginning double line was not available throughout, but it was provided after a short time. Coal traffic started operating on 9 September 1843. Merging with other railways Now that the line was operating, the possibility of merging the Bristol and Gloucester Railway with the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway was raised again at the end of 1844, and this time found favour. The respective Chairmen ratified an agreement on 14 January 1845 and the shareholders of the two companies approved it on 28 January. The agreement would have required formalisation by Parliament, but a Bill for the purpose failed standing orders. The Great Western Railway immediately moved to propose that the broad gauge should be implemented throughout the new company, that is, into Birmingham, and this developed into a proposal to amalgamate the combined company with the Great Western Railway. The negotiation was simply a matter of cash; on 24 January 1845 a Great Western deputation offered ¬£60 of GWR stock for ¬£100 of Birmingham and Gloucester, at market values equating to about ¬£123 for ¬£109. The matter was adjourned until a meeting planned for 27 January, but John Ellis, Deputy Chairman of the Midland Railway happened to meet the Birmingham and Gloucester directors. He was aware of the inconvenience of the break of gauge and motivated by fear of that approaching too near to his own business location in Leicester. Ellis soon offered them a perpetual lease at 6% on the ¬£1.8 million capital of the two Gloucester companies, in addition taking on the half-million pound debts. Unable to consult colleagues in the time available, he made this offer entirely on his own responsibility. This was done without hostility to the GWR, he said later, but simply to avoid the extension of the broad gauge. His offer was ratified by the Midland directors on 8 February 1845, and from 1 July the Midland leased the two companies, confirmed by Parliament on 3 August 1846 (as there was not time to prepare the amalgamation Bill for the 1845 session. The Bristol and Gloucester Railway and the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway were now part of the Midland Railway.Maggs, Bristol and Gloucester Railway, pages 25 to 32 The Great Western Railway secured a clause in the Act of Amalgamation requiring the Midland to maintain \\"two lines of railway of the same gauge as the Great Western Railway\\" between Bristol and Standish, with running powers over them for the GWR. In 1848 Midland obtained an Act authorising them to add narrow (standard) gauge rails between Bristol and Standish and to lay a separate narrow gauge double track from Standish into Gloucester. This Bill, as well as those for the amalgamation, were the responsibility of the Midland's solicitor Samuel Carter. Part of the Midland Railway So from February 1845 the Bristol and Gloucester Railway was effectively part of the Midland Railway. The new owner bought out Stothert and Slaughter's working contract and their rolling stock in July 1845, but continued to work the Bristol and Gloucester line on the broad gauge, using the Great Western tracks between Standish and Gloucester station, and the C&GWUR; station at Gloucester, although the owning company had not yet reached there. The Coalpit Heath branch of the old Bristol and Gloucestershire Railway was converted to broad gauge and upgraded for locomotive use; this was ready on 9 June 1847. Gloucester lines The Bristol and Gloucester lines in 1864At this time (February 1845), the Gloucester railways consisted of the narrow (standard) gauge former Birmingham and Gloucester line approaching from the north-east, and turning to the west from Barnwood to its terminus station; and the broad gauge former Bristol and Gloucester line approaching from the south-west, and turning to the west to the C&GWUR; terminus. In addition the Gloucester and Cheltenham Railway (the horse plateway) was in operation. The Great Western Railway opened the C&GWUR; line on the broad gauge on 12 May 1845, joining the Bristol line at Standish. The fact enabled the GWR to repurchase \\"its\\" half of the Cheltenham line that was already opened according to the earlier Act. Direct running by-passing Gloucester was desirable, but the Midland Railway had a break of gauge at Gloucester, so it was the GWR which built the third side of the triangle as a broad gauge line. This was ready in 1847 by which time mixed gauge had been installed between Gloucester and Cheltenham. Captain Simmons inspected the new arrangements in October 1847 for the Board of Trade: > Additional rails have now been laid from Cheltenham to Gloucester, uniting > the gauges in one line of railway [that is, forming mixed gauge] and a > connexion on the broad gauge has been made between the two lines leading > into Gloucester Station, called the \\"Avoiding Line\\"... the junction of the > Avoiding Line with the line from Gloucester station to Cheltenham is called > the \\"Barnwood Junction\\"; and the point of meeting of the Avoiding Line with > the Bristol and London line is called the \\"Millstream Junction\\"... [It is > not] contemplated to unite carriages of both gauges in one train.Report by > Captain Simmons to the Railway Commissioners, 13 October 1847, quoted in > MacDermot, volume I part 1 pages 185 and 186 A political cartoon emphasising the evils of the break of gauge at Gloucester The Midland Railway was now working two separate lines of different gauges, terminating at different (although adjacent) stations in Gloucester. This was hardly a satisfactory long-term situation, and on 14 August 1848 the Midland obtained an authorising Act for the Gloucester and Stonehouse Junction Railway. This enabled it to lay standard gauge tracks alongside the GWR between Standish Junction (which was near Stonehouse) and Tramway Junction, at the east end of the Gloucester stations, and to lay narrow (standard) gauge rails on the Bristol and Gloucester line between Bristol and Standish. By the Act of 1846 they were not allowed to remove the broad gauge rails on the Bristol to Standish section. These were never used by the Great Western, and it was not until the GWR converted the gauge of its own lines in the area in 1872 that the Midland was able to discontinue their maintenance. Even then a daily broad gauge coal train of the Bristol and Exeter Railway ran to and from Parkfield colliery, and the broad gauge rails had to be maintained as far as Westerleigh, and on the branch. The work was brought into use on 22 May 1854. Approaching Gloucester, the new line diverged from the GWR at Tuffley Junction on to the Tuffley Loop, which made a westerly sweep and joined the other lines from west to east at Gloucester, enabling a form of direct running. However it was not possible to run directly to the Midland Railway passenger or goods stations, which were situated as a terminus. Midland Railway trains could at last run through on the narrow gauge from Bristol to Birmingham, but they needed to back in to the station to make the passenger call. There were five new level crossings on the Tuffley Loop, and there were now four tracks, two narrow and two broad gauge, between Standish and Tuffley Junction. The work cost ¬£150,042. Docks branches Down coal train south of Haresfield in 1962The GWR and the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway had jointly acquired the Gloucester and Cheltenham Railway, a horse-operated plateway; the original purpose was to get access to the docks at Gloucester. The tramway was of gauge and in street running in Gloucester it made some extremely sharp turns at road junctions. Various proposals were made to convert the plateway to standard gauge in Gloucester, but these were never implemented, and the use by the others railways of the plateway's right of way was confined to sidings within the docks. A very short stub from the Bristol and Gloucester goods station to a location alongside the plateway was made in 1840; transshipment was necessary there. It closed in 1896. Independent railway access to the docks was made in 1848 when the High Orchard Branch was opened, from the Tuffley Loop. It closed on 1 October 1971. In 1900 the New Docks Branch was opened from Tuffley Junction, crossing the Berkeley Canal by a swing bridge to the west side, and joining with the GWR docks branch near Llanthony Bridge. There was a short stub to Hempsted Wharf (on the east side of the canal) and, from 1913, the gas works, which had previously been served exclusively by the canal. These branches all closed by 1971.Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain ‚Äì A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, Gauge conversion In 1872 the GWR converted all its broad gauge and mixed gauge track in the Gloucester area to standard gauge. As part of that work it removed the Avoiding Line and the spur to the T station (\\"long derelict\\") altogether.MacDermot, volume II, page 598 Further Gloucester improvements The need to reverse in and out of the Gloucester station was a continuing difficulty, and on 12 April 1896 a new through station was opened, on the curve adjacent to the former station; this was a considerable step forward. It was later named Gloucester Eastgate station. The former Bristol and Gloucester and Birmingham and Gloucester stations were limited to goods operation. The Avoiding Line, now known as the Cheltenham Loop, was reinstated and opened for goods traffic on 25 November 1901; through passenger operation over it followed on 1 July 1908. Bristol lines The former Bristol and Gloucester Railway lines in 1903The Midland Railway passenger trains used the GWR Temple Meads station at Bristol. This was fairly limited in size until enlargement in 1878, and of course handled the traffic of the Bristol and Exeter Railway in addition. Avonside Wharf was used for transfer to and from river barges and lighters. From 1858 the Midland Railway established its own goods facilities at St Philips, and on 2 May 1870 a single platform passenger station was opened there, dealing chiefly with Bath trains. A major engine shed was opened at Barrow Road in 1873 complemented by a carriage shed in 1877. Branch lines As a main line trunk railway, the Bristol and Gloucester line had a number of branch lines added over the years; they are described from north to south. =Quedgeley= In 1915 an ammunition factory was established at Quedgeley, immediately south of Tuffley Junction. It had a rail connection and a considerable network of sidings amounting to about three miles. There was a workers' platform from 13 December 1915 until 1925. The buildings were demolished after 1924 and the branch closed in 1925. In World War II an RAF station, RAF Quedgeley, was established on the site on 15 April 1939; it was a storage and maintenance depot for aircraft equipment and motor vehicles. It continued in this logistics role until its closure in 1995. It had a branch line, open from 9 April 1939 to 1990.Brian Edwards, National Filling Factory No. 5 Quedgeley, extract from Gloucestershire Society for Industrial Archaeology, Journal for 1994, pages 32 to 52History of the RAF in Quedgeley, in Quedgeley News atMaggs, Bristol and Gloucester Railway, page 82 =Nailsworth and Stroud= In 1867 the Stonehouse and Nailsworth Railway was opened. Nailsworth was an important centre of local industry; the line ran from Stonehouse on the Bristol and Gloucester line. The building company was desperately short of money, and their line was purchased by the Midland Railway in 1868. A branch from that line to Stroud was originally authorised, but not built at first; the GWR Swindon line already served Stroud. In 1885 the Midland Railway Stroud branch from the Nailsworth line was opened. Passenger services ceased in 1947 and the goods service was discontinued in 1966.Colin G Maggs, The Nailsworth and Stroud Branch, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2000, =Dursley= The town of Dursley felt disadvantaged by being left off the railway network, and local interests promoted the Dursley and Midland Junction Railway, to make a short branch from Coaley on the Bristol and Gloucester line. It opened on 18 September 1856; the junction station was named Dursley Junction at first. This line too was in a difficult financial situation, and sold its concern to the Midland Railway in 1860. Passenger services were withdrawn in 1962. An engineering business at Dursley sustained the line for some years, but it closed completely in 1970.Peter Smith, The Dursley Branch, Oakwood Press, 1981, =Sharpness and Lydney= Sharpness was an important centre of local industry, and in addition was a port on the River Severn, and the point at which the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal originated, running towards Gloucester. The Midland Railway built a branch line, which opened on 1 August 1876, from Berkeley Road station on the main line, a distance of four miles.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume II: 1863 ‚Äì 1921, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931, paged 404, 406 In 1879 the Severn Bridge Railway opened, joining Lydney to Sharpness and creating a through route across the River Severn. Although the promoters had hoped to create a new trunk route, the limited carrying capacity of the Severn Bridge frustrated plans to run heavy main line trains across it.R M Huxley, The Rise and Fall of the Severn Bridge Railway, 1872 ‚Äì 1970, Amberley Publishing, Stroud, second edition 2008, The Great Western Railway opened a south curve to the Sharpness branch in 1908, in connection with the Badminton railway line, below. =Thornbury branch= The Midland Railway opened the Thornbury branch on 2 September 1872, from Yate. There was a short branch off the line to Frampton Cotterell where there were iron ore workings. The Frampton Cotterell section lasted only until 15 April 1878. Thornbury itself warranted a passenger train service, but that was withdrawn on 19 June 1944. Total closure of the branch took place on 24 November 1967. In 1970 the Tytherington Quarry sought a rail connection, and the line as far as the quarry was reopened; stone trains started running from 3 July 1972. =Connections at Yate from the Badminton line= At the turn of the century, the Great Western Railway was under pressure to improve its route from South Wales to London. A very heavy flow of coal and other minerals ran on this axis, but although the Severn Tunnel had been opened, shortening the route, it still ran through Filton and Bath. The line through Bath was exceptionally congested. The GWR decided to build a cut-off line between Patchway, on the approach to the Severn Tunnel and Wootton BassettWootton Bassett was retitled Royal Wootton Bassett in 2009. which shortened the route and relieved the section at Bath. There was a curve to Filton giving direct access to Bristol. The line was officially referred to as the South Wales and Bristol Direct Railway. The new line intersected the Bristol and Gloucester line at Westerleigh, and curves from the west and the east on the Badminton line were formed, joining the Bristol and Gloucester line at Yate by a grade-separated junction. In its authorising Act the GWR obtained running powers to Sharpness, and a south curve was made at Berkeley Road (above) to give direct access. The GWR already had historic running powers from Bristol to Standish Junction. The GWR attempted to use the running powers to operate from Bristol through Filton and Westerleigh to join the Midland at Yate and continue to Standish, but the Midland challenged this on the basis that the new running powers were for traffic to Sharpness only, and the earlier running powers required them to run via Fishponds on the Midland Railway. For the time being the GWR was obliged to use the Fishponds line, attracting a greater toll charge for the running to the Midland. Many years later the GWR was able to use the loop for Gloucester trains, and they were extended to reach Birmingham through Stratford-upon- Avon. The east curve at Westerleigh, and the link into Sharpness, were little used.Kevin Robertson and David Abbott, GWR The Badminton Line: A Portrait of a Railway, Alan Sutton Publishing Limited, 1988 reprinted 1997, =Branch line to Bath= Bath was an important destination, and the Midland Railway built a branch line to it from the Bristol and Gloucester line. It opened on 4 August 1869 from a triangular junction at Mangotsfield; a new junction station was opened at Mangotsfield on the same day. There had been an earlier Mangotsfield station, located at the North Junction, but the new station was greatly enlarged. When the Somerset and Dorset Railway opened its line to Bath on 20 July 1874, the Midland Railway's Bath branch was on a through route from the South Coast at Bournemouth, and traffic volumes expanded considerably. There was an extremely heavy traffic at summer weekends over the S&D; Line, using the Midland branch to Bath.Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Country Railway Routes: Bath Green Park to Bristol, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 1999, =Avonmouth= On 1 October 1874 the Clifton Extension Railway opened, connecting the Bristol Port Railway and Pier back into Bristol itself, with a GWR connection to Narroways Hill Junction. The long tunnel under Clifton Down had been a formidable challenge. At the same time the Midland Railway made a connection from Kingswood Junction on the Bristol ‚Äì Mangotsfield line, to Ashley Hill Junction, joining the GWR line from Narroways Hill Junction there. The Clifton Extension Railway itself was joint between the Midland and Great Western Railways from 1890.Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Branch Lines Around Avonmouth, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2004, Colin Maggs, The Bristol Port Railway and Pier, The Oakwood Press, Usk, 1975, From 1923 After World War I the Government passed the Railways Act 1921 which compulsorily restructured the main line railways of Great Britain into one or other of four new large companies, the \\"groups\\". The process was referred to as \\"the grouping\\" and is considered to be effective from 1 January 1923. The Midland Railway was a constituent of the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the Great Western Railway, with others, was a constituent of the new enlarged Great Western Railway. Consequently, the LMS was now the controlling company for the former Bristol and Gloucester line, but the process imposed little other change on practices locally. From 1948 On 1 January 1948 the main line railways of Great Britain were taken into national ownership, under British Railways. At first the former companies were replicated, and the London Midland Region of British Railways operated the Bristol and Gloucester line, while the Western Region operated the former Great Western Railway lines in the area. In 1949 the last of the collieries on the old Bristol and Gloucestershire Railway branch to Coalpit Heath closed down and the branch too was closed.Maggs, Bristol and Gloucester Railway, page 88 Since the Great Western Railway had enlarged Temple Meads station at Bristol, the necessity to use St Philip's station had gone, and it was closed on 21 September 1953. The Avonmouth connection between Kingswood Junction and Ashley Hill Junction closed in 1965. Following the publication of the Beeching Report (the Reshaping of British Railways) widespread closures of unremunerative stations and lines took place in the latter years of the 1960s. Intermediate stations between Bristol and Gloucester were closed on 4 January 1965. On 7 March 1966 the former Midland Railway Bath branch and the Somerset and Dorset line were closed, although the Bath branch remained in use until 31 May 1971 for coal traffic to Bath Gas Works. The quadruple track between Standish Junction and Tuffley Junction was reduced to double track on 8 September 1968. The existence of two adjacent stations at Gloucester was not in keeping with expectations in the 1970s, and a rationalisation scheme was developed. This resulted in closure of Gloucester Eastgate station on 1 December 1975, as well as the entire Tuffley Loop, and the concentration of all passenger traffic on the GWR station, Gloucester Central. The Central station was itself rationalised to a single long platform. The route layout at Gloucester was therefore a simple triangle, with the south-western apex leading to Standish, the western apex towards Chepstow, and the north-eastern towards Cheltenham. All through passenger trains from Bristol to Cheltenham and beyond needed to reverse in the Gloucester station if they were making a call there. At Bristol, the section of line between Lawrence Hill Junction (just north of Temple Meads)) and Yate was closed on 29 December 1969. Trains on the Bristol to Gloucester axis ran instead via Filton, Stoke Gifford and Westerleigh Junction, rejoining the Bristol and Gloucester line at Yate. Westerleigh sidings were retained as an engineers' depot and private siding. When Bristol Parkway station opened at Stoke Gifford on 1 May 1972Railway Magazine, June 1972, page 328 passenger trains on the Bristol to Gloucester route made calls there, giving the possibility of making connections with South Wales main line services. Yate station was reopened on 11 May 1989, and Cam & Dursley station was opened on 29 May 1994. The present day The majority of the Bristol and Gloucester Railway is in heavy use at present (2017) between Yate and Horton Road in Gloucester. The dominant traffic is long distance passenger trains, with an additional volume of local traffic and some heavy haul freight.

The first number (in the series 1 ‚Äì 11) was given by Stothert and Slaughter who were contracted to operate the railway.Maggs, Bristol and Gloucester Railway, pages 97 to 100 Although the Midland Railway (MR) purchased these eleven locomotives from the contractors in July 1845, and absorbed the Bristol & Gloucester Railway (and the Birmingham & Gloucester Railway) on 3 August 1846, the locomotives were not given MR numbers until February 1847, when they became nos. 260‚Äì270.

( ‚Äì January 10, 1322) was a scholastic philosopher and theologian. Little of his life before 1312 is known. After this time, he taught at the Franciscan convent in Bologna, then at the convent in Toulouse, around 1314. He went to Paris in 1316 in order to qualify for his doctorate, where he read the Sentences. In 1318 he was appointed master of theology at the University of Paris. In 1321, he was appointed by his mentor, Pope John XXII, to the position of Archbishop of Aix-en-Provence, but died not long after in 1322. Works and doctrine Auriol's first work was on evangelical poverty, where he argued for a moderate position between those of the spirituals and conventuals. He is best known for the enormous Scriptum super primum Sententiarum, his commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, which runs to more than 1100 folio pages and was eventually printed in Rome in 1596. He also wrote Tractatus de principiis, a non-theological work, while he was lector at the Franciscan convent in Bologna some time before 1312, and some treatises on the Immaculate Conception at the Franciscan convent in Toulouse. Auriol was at first a Scotist. Later, he arrived at a position closer to that of the nominalist Durandus. He denied the reality of universals, the existence of species and of the active intellect, the distinction between essence and existence, and the distinction between the soul and its faculties. These doctrines are considered by some to have prepared the way for the conceptualism of Ockham. Ockham was certainly aware of Auriol's work. His ability earned for him the titles of Doctor Facundus and Doctor Abundans.

The house was owned and occupied by ten successive generations of the Pickering family including Colonel Timothy Pickering. This house is believed to have been the oldest house in the United States continuously occupied by one family. However, in 1998, the Goodhue family moved into the house, with Albert Goodhue as the primary caretaker. It is located at 18 Broad Street, Salem, Massachusetts and is open to the public under the auspices of the nonprofit Pickering Foundation. Across the street is the Broad Street Cemetery, one of the three oldest in Salem. History Although the core house is first period, it has evolved considerably over the years. The original house was two stories tall, with a single room on each floor, and an entry bay. The left side was then added circa 1682 by his son, John Pickering II. In 1751, Deacon Timothy Pickering raised a rear lean-to up to a full two stories, which is how the house exists today. Pickering House in c. 1905 In 1841 the front facade was reworked in the Gothic Revival style, with the facade gables probably dating from this time. Many of the house's external features date from this alteration, including the roof finials, round windows in the gables, cornice brackets, and exterior entry porch. Family records also suggest that a passageway was cut through the chimney stack at this time, and that the exterior chimney was remodeled to today's columnar style at this time. The Gothic-style fence with its cut-outs and obelisk finials was also added in this renovation. In 1904 a two-story ell was added to the rear. In 1948, Boston architect Gordon Robb carried out interior restoration work to reintroduce more Colonial Revival features.

Proposal The creation of this new administrative unit was proposed by the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians political party. In this proposal, the Hungarian Regional Autonomy is proposed to be an autonomous region in the northern part of Vojvodina including the nine municipalities of northern Vojvodina: Subotica, Baƒçka Topola, Mali Iƒëo≈°, Kanji≈æa, Senta, Ada, Beƒçej, ƒåoka, and Novi Kne≈æevac. The administrative centre of the region would be Subotica, while the region itself would be part of Vojvodina within Serbia. The proposal for the creation of the Hungarian Regional Autonomy is based on the autonomy model of South Tyrol in Italy. Besides the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians and its coalition partners from Hungarian Coalition, some other ethnic Hungarian political parties and movements, like Hungarian Civic Alliance and 64 Counties Movement also advocating territorial autonomy for ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina and Serbia. Some variants of these proposals advocating that only 8 municipalities should be included into Hungarian autonomous region, excluding the municipality of Novi Kne≈æevac, which have a Serb ethnic majority. Contrary to this, the proposal of the 64 Counties Movement advocates creation of Hungarian autonomous region in much larger territory, which would include not only municipalities with Hungarian majority or plurality, but also sizable neighboring areas, where several notable towns with Serb ethnic majority are located. Demographics According to the 2011 census data, the proposed new region would have a population composed of 49.6% Hungarians, 26.9% Serbs, 4.8% Croats, 4.4% Bunjevci, 2.2% Romani, and others. Some 61.1% of all Hungarians living in Serbia and 61.8% of all Hungarians living in Vojvodina would live within the borders of the proposed region.

Early life Philip Dansken Ross was born in Montreal to parents Christina Chalmers Dansken and Montreal accountant Philip Simpson Ross. Ross studied at McGill University as a science major in 1875. At McGill, Ross played for the football and rowing clubs, later captaining the McGill football club to victory against Harvard University in the first Canada-U.S. international football game in 1878. He was provincial single sculling champion twice. He also played lacrosse and founded several golf clubs. He graduated from McGill in 1875, with honours. Career Upon graduation, Ross worked for the Montreal Harbour Commission. He left the Commission and joined the staff at the Montreal Star in 1880. He joined the Toronto Daily Mail as a journalist. He returned to Montreal and joined the Montreal Star in 1885, eventually becoming its managing editor. In 1886, Ross became co-owner of the near- bankrupt Ottawa Evening Journal newspaper. In 1891 he bought out his partner and made it into a highly successful and respected paper. He served as its president for 60 years during which time he helped found the Canadian Press newspaper association. He was a builder and sometimes player of the Ottawa Hockey Club, later to be known as the Ottawa Senators. With this club, he befriended the sons of Lord Stanley, the Governor-General of Canada. In 1892, Lord Stanley appointed him to be a trustee for his championship ice hockey trophy, known today as the Stanley Cup. He helped found the Ontario Hockey Association in 1890. He played in the first Ontario championship game in 1891 at the Rideau Rink in Ottawa, helping Ottawa win 5-0 over Toronto St. George's. Ross was one of the two original Trustees of the Stanley Cup named by Lord Stanley in 1894, and so served for 56 years until his death. He also served as trustee for the Minto Cup of lacrosse. He turned down the trusteeship for the Grey Cup of Canadian football. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1976. =Politics= He also went into politics. In 1912, Ross was nominated by the Civic Improvement League to be their mayoral candidate.

He is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church. Life He was born Antonio Pierozzi (also called de Forciglioni) on 1 March 1389 in the city of Florence, then capital of an independent Republic, to Niccol√≤ and Tomasina Pierozzi, prominent citizens of the city, Niccol√≤ being a notary. The young Anthony was received into the Dominican Order in 1405 at the age of sixteen at the new priory of the Order in Fiesole and given the religious habit by the Blessed John Dominici, founder of the community, becoming its first candidate. Soon, in spite of his youth, he was tasked with the administration of various houses of his Order at Cortona, Rome, Naples, as well as Florence, which he labored zealously to reform. These communities had become part of a new Dominican Congregation of Tuscany, established by John Dominici in order to promote a stricter form of life within the Order, which had been devastated through its division in the Western Schism of the preceding century. From 1433-1446 Antoninus served as vicar of the Congregation. In this office, he was involved in the establishment of the Priory of St Mark in Florence. The priory's cells, including one for Cosimo de' Medici, were painted in frescos by Fra Angelico and his assistants. Antoninus was consecrated Archbishop of Florence on 13 March 1446, at the Dominican priory in Fiesole, on the initiative of Pope Eugene IV, who had come to admire him through his participation in the major church councils of the period. He came to win the esteem and love of his people, especially by his energy and resource in combating the effects of the plague and earthquake in 1448 and 1453. It was they who began the use of the diminutive form of his name which has come to prevail. Antoninus lived a life of austerity as archbishop, continuing to follow the Dominican Rule. His relations with the Medici regime were close but not always harmonious, with his serving several times as an ambassador for the Republic to the Holy See during the 1450s. Antoninus died on 2 May 1459, and Pope Pius II conducted his funeral. The pope happened to be on his way to the Council of Mantua when he heard of the archbishop's death. The archbishop's wish was that he be buried at the priory which he had founded in the city. Writings Confessionale, circa 1488-1490 Antoninus had a great reputation for theological learning, and had assisted as a papal theologian at the Council of Florence. Of his various works, the list of which is given in Qu√©tif-√âchard, De Scriptoribus Ordinis Praedicatorum, vol. i.818, the best-known are his Summa theologica moralis (printed in 1477) and the Summa confessionalis, Curam illius habes (printed in 1472). Both were printed years after the author's death. The latter is one of three guides for confessors which he wrote, and it was highly regarded by the clergy as an aid for centuries. His writings were a major development in the field of moral theology. For a more up to date list of works and manuscripts, see Thomas Kaeppeli, Scriptores ordinis praedicatorum medii aevi, vol. 1 (Rome: Ad S. Sabinaa, 1970). In 1477 Antoninus' the Chronicon partibus tribus distincta ab initio mundi ad MCCCLX was published; it was intended to be a history of creation from a religious perspective, up to the end of the 14th century. Though uncritical in its account of earlier ages, his accounts of more current events have been useful to historians. Antoninus' writings, some in Italian, reflect a pronounced awareness of the problems of social and economic development. He argued in them that the state had a duty to intervene in mercantile affairs for the common good, and the obligation to help the poor and needy. His viewpoint on the vanity of women's dress made concessions to the social status of women of high birth or married to holders of high office. Veneration Antoninus was canonized on 31 May 1523 by Pope Adrian VI, who himself held ideas of radical and drastic church reform similar to those of Antoninus. His feast day, which was not in the Tridentine Calendar, was inserted in the General Roman Calendar in 1683, for celebration on 10 MayCalendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 122 as a Double, a rank altered in 1960 to that of Third-Class Feast. Since 1969, it is no longer in the General Roman Calendar, but the Roman Martyrology indicates that it is still observed, moved to 2 May, the day of his death.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 ) Antoninus is honored as the patron saint of Moncalvo, near Turin. Saint Antoninus is honored as the patron saint of the Catholic Church & Aglipayan Church of the Municipality of Pura, Tarlac Philippines.

Biography Perne was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1539, BD in 1547 and DD in 1552. He was elected fellow of St John's in 1540, but moved to Queens' later that year. He was successively bursar and dean of Queens', culminating in becoming vice-president in 1551, and was five times vice-chancellor of the university. Scurrilous Puritans said he had once been the homosexual lover of John Whitgift, later Archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he went to live in old age at Lambeth Palace.Diarmaid MacCulloch, Reformation: Europe's House Divided, London, 2005 But he owes his notoriety to his remarkable versatility, and, like the Vicar of Bray, he was always faithful to the national religion, whatever it might be. A weathervane he donated with his initials of AP was said to have swung between 'A Papist','A Protestant', and 'A Puritan', depending on which way the wind blew.Diarmaid MacCulloch, op. cit., p.209. In April 1547 he advocated Catholic doctrines, but recanted two months later, and his Protestant faith was strengthened during Edward VI's reign; he was appointed a royal chaplain and canon of Windsor. Soon after Mary's accession, however, he perceived the error of his ways and was made Master of Peterhouse in 1553 and Dean of Ely in 1557. He preached the sermon in 1557 when the bodies of Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius were disinterred in Cambridge and burnt for heresy, and also, remarkably, in 1560 when these proceedings were reversed and the dead heretics were rehabilitated. In Elizabeth's reign he subscribed the Thirty-nine Articles, denounced the pope and tried to convert Abbot Feckenham to Protestantism; and in 1584 Whitgift in vain recommended him for a bishopric. He was selected as the type of Anglican prelate by the authors of the Martin Marprelate tracts and other Puritans, who nicknamed him \\"Old Andrew Turncoat\\", \\"Andrew Ambo\\", \\"Old Father Palinode\\". Cambridge wits, it was said, translated \\"perno\\" by \\"I turn, I rat, I change often\\"; and a coat that had often been turned was said to have been \\"perned\\". Historian Alice Hogge recounts an episode in which a close friend asked Perne \\"to tell her honestly and simply which was the holy religion that see her safe to heaven\\".

Fauna The breeding marine avifauna of Alijos Rocks currently consists of Leach's storm-petrel (a presumed breeder, probably a few pairs), red-billed tropicbird (14 birds), masked booby (100), and sooty tern (250). The magnificent frigatebird is a regular winter visitor but probably does not breed. The Laysan albatross is currently an annual visitor to Alijos Rocks during its winter breeding season, and may start to nest there in the near future.

It is carried over the Swan River at the eastern end of Perth Water by two bridges on either side of Heirisson Island. The current Causeway is the third structure to have been built across the river at this point. Originally the site of mudflats which restricted river navigation, the Colony Government constructed a causeway and bridge across the site. The project was first planned in 1834 and opened in 1843. When floods in 1862 almost destroyed it, the structure was rebuilt using convict labour, and raised to better withstand future floods. Governor John Hampton officially opened the new Causeway on 12 November 1867. Over the following decades, the three bridges making up this second Causeway were widened several times, and they were eventually replaced in 1952. The current Causeway bridges were designed by E W C Godfrey, and built between 1947 and 1952. They were the first in Western Australia to use steel composite construction. Large roundabouts were also constructed at each end of the structure, to improve the flow of traffic. The opening of the Graham Farmer Freeway in 2000 reduced the traffic volume on the Causeway, allowing the two central lanes to be turned into bus lanes. By the early 2000s, the concrete structures had suffered significant damage. Cracks were repaired using carbon fibre reinforcement and localised patching, extending the bridge's life by decades. The Causeway bridges have been recognised for their heritage value by their entry on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places.  History  Following the settlement of the Swan River Colony in 1829, the Swan River was the main transportation link between Perth and the port of Fremantle.Edmonds, p. 12 Land transportation was difficult as the only river crossing near Perth, a ford at the eastern end of the town, was often impassable for wagons and carts. The next crossing point was upstream at Guildford, a major detour.Edmonds, p. 14 The only alternative to these river crossings were ferries, which operated from North Fremantle, Preston Point, and The Narrows. =First Causeway= Soon after the colony was founded, settlers lobbied for the construction of a road across the mudflats in the Swan River at the eastern end of the town. A preliminary survey of the site was conducted in 1834 by the Commissioner for Roads and Bridges, George Fletcher Moore, together with Surveyor General John Septimus Roe.Cygnet, p. 5 A public meeting on 17 February 1837 passed a resolution urging the colony's government to construct the road at the site, and Roe showed the public plans for the proposed causeway.Cygnet, p. 6 A year later, in January 1838, the Perth Gazette noted that preliminary work had been carried out towards building the causeway, which is thought to have been the upgrading of Adelaide Terrace from the \\"bush track\\" it was previously. Stereoscopic photograph of the original Perth Bridge taken A committee was set up in October 1838 to investigate the viability of a causeway at the site. On 16 February 1839 plans which had been prepared by Roe were submitted by the committee's chairman to Henry Trigg, the Superintendent of Public Works. Trigg called for other plans and prepared estimates. At a meeting of the committee on 27 February 1839, Trigg submitted a plan designed by Major Frederick Irwin, which was estimated to cost ¬£2,300. The committee cut the estimated figure to ¬£1,800, and waited for Governor Hutt to specify how much could be funded by the government.Cygnet, p. 7 This original \\"causeway\\" consisted of a central bridge (for river navigation), with a raised rampart on either side. The first pile of the central bridge was driven home on 2 November 1840. The bridge was completed in 1841, costing ¬£449.10s, although the approaches to the bridge took longer to complete. The causeway was sufficiently completed in January 1842 to be used by horsemen, and the causeway was finally finished in May 1843 at a total cost of ¬£1,814.10s. It was officially opened on 24 May 1843 by J. W. Hardey, the chairman of the Road Trust, in the presence of only one other person, one of his friends. The causeway was originally a toll road, and costs for crossing ranged from one penny (1d) for a person on foot to 6d for a horse-drawn cart. The tolls were subject to an additional levy of 50 per cent during the night hours. The tolls were later removed, and it appears to have been Perth's only toll road. = Second Causeway = The second Causeway with a tram, viewed from the Perth side. In June 1862 major flooding was experienced in many towns in the region, resulting in losses over ¬£30,000.Cygnet, p. 8 In Perth, Mounts Bay Road was completely submerged, and the original causeway was almost destroyed after being under seven or eight feet () of water. However, Governor John Hampton ordered that the causeway should be reconstructed and raised several feet. The new Causeway was designed by Richard Roach Jewell and built by convicts. The opening of the newly refurbished Causeway was a more pompous affair than that of the first Causeway. The second causeway was to be opened by the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Alfred; however the Royal Navy ship failed to call in to Western Australia on its way to Sydney. As a result, the Governor proceeded with the opening in the Duke's absence. On 12 November 1867 the Governor drove \\"through an avenue of flags and bunting\\" from Government House to the Causeway. There were military corps, a band and a great crowd present for the opening.Cygnet, p. 9 After speeches by dignitaries, the Governor declared the new Causeway open with the following words:Cygnet, p. 10 The proceedings were then disrupted when a man \\"raced across the newly-opened bridge before the Governor's procession\\" on horseback after announcing the following to the astonished crowd: The parade, including the Governor's carriage, then proceeded over the new Causeway after Maley. The Governor's procession continued on steam boats upstream to Guildford where the Governor opened the new Guildford and Helena Bridges.Cygnet, p. 11 This second Causeway was made up of three bridges with a combined length of .Godfrey, p. 185 Budget constraints encountered during construction meant that the bridges were structurally quite weak. A maximum of or six head of cattle was initially allowed across at a time. This Causeway was modified several times during its life. In 1899 it was widened by the addition of a footpath, while by 1904 it had been strengthened and widened by an average of . In June 1905 the Causeway was placed under the control of the Minister for Works. From 1932 to 1933 the Causeway bridges were widened a further on their downstream side, which increased the total width to . = Third Causeway = Riverside Drive to Canning Highway Plans to build a new bridge at The Narrows downstream from the Causeway in the aftermath of World War II were put on hold while a new Causeway could be constructed. Vehicle traffic using the Causeway had almost doubled between 1930 and 1939. The Third Causeway Bridge under construction The current Causeway was built between 1947 and 1952, and designed by E. W. C. Godfrey. It is made up of two bridges, meeting at Heirisson Island. Considerable work was carried out to dredge the river to provide much wider navigation channels. The Heirisson Islands were turned into a single island and a substantial portion of land beside Trinity College was reclaimed. The bridges were the \\"first truly modern bridges\\" built in Perth after World War II, being the first bridges in Western Australia to use steel composite construction, and only the second (and third) in Australia. The bridges have a combined length of , with both featuring a roadway allowing for six traffic lanes, and an footway on the western side. In order to achieve a sufficiently high clearance above the river channels at high tide, the bridges have graded approaches that increase the roadway elevation. The south-eastern bridge is the longer of the two, at long. It is made up of 11 spans, each consisting of nine welded plate girders, with a relieving span at each end. The north- western bridge is shorter, at only in length, and has five spans, with a relieving span at each end. The bridge decks are of reinforced concrete supported by the plate girders, which are in turn freely supported by the concrete piers. Concrete railing along eastern side of roadway Supply problems in the aftermath of the War meant that the concrete piers were founded on jarrah timber piles, rather than concrete. Additionally, a steel plate shortage forced the bridge's designers to avoid the use of steel to design the forms in the bridge's superstructure.Godfrey, p. 189 Also, the cement that was used on the bridges had to be procured from seven different sources, which led to variable durability of different parts of the bridges. The previous Causeway had carried electric trams, and it was expected that the new Causeway would also do so, or perhaps trolleybuses instead. However, the proposed overhead wires were deemed too ugly for the new bridge, and between ¬£30,000 and ¬£40,000 could be saved by using buses instead. The tram routes using the Causeway were replaced with bus services but, despite that, the bridges were designed to be able to carry trams. The south-eastern bridge was the first to be completed, and was opened on 19 September 1952, with traffic continuing to use the other two bridges of the previous Causeway. Work then continued on the north-western bridge with further reclamation of land. Roundabouts were constructed at each end of The Causeway, to improve the flow of traffic on the bridges and the distribution of traffic back into the road network.Edmonds, p. 127 The eastern roundabout opened in 1952, while the western one did not open until December 1954.Edmonds, pp. 129‚Äì30 Guides on the usage of the roundabouts were published in newspapers. In 1973, construction began on a grade-separated partial cloverleaf interchange at the eastern end of the Causeway. The $1.3 million interchange opened on 8 March 1974.Edmonds, p. 258 By 1954, traffic entering the city by the Causeway had doubled, leading to renewed calls for a new bridge further west at The Narrows. That bridge was eventually built as the Narrows Bridge, which opened in 1959. The Narrows and the Causeway continued to be the only road crossings of the Swan River between Fremantle and Maylands until the Windan Bridge of the Graham Farmer Freeway opened in 2000. The opening of the latter eastern bypass coincided with the conversion of the Causeway's two centre lanes to bus lanes. It also reduced traffic levels on the Causeway from cars per day to within six months. The western roundabout, the state's worst black spot since 1989,Edmonds, p. 389 was also remodelled in 2000 into a traffic light-controlled raindrop roundabout, in conjunction with the other works on the Causeway. The variable-quality of the cement which had been used in the construction of the Causeway bridges meant that, by the early 2000s, they had suffered significant damage. A repair contract was awarded to Kulin Group in 2004. Localised patching of cracks in the piers was undertaken. At the ends of the piers, the cracking was more substantial and had to be tied back with carbon fibre reinforcement. Repairs were then treated with a moisture-resistant coating, and were expected to lengthen the life of the bridges by decades. The Causeway bridges received an interim entry on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places on 30 June 1998, which was made permanent on 30 October 1998. They were also classified by the National Trust on 8 June 1998.  Route description  The Causeway heading towards East Perth The Causeway begins in East Perth, at the intersection of Riverside Drive, Adelaide Terrace, and Hay Street. This intersection is a traffic light controlled raindrop roundabout. The road reaches the Swan River's northern foreshore after , and crosses to Heirisson Island via the north-western bridge. The road continues straight across the island for another . The road passes over the second, bridge, which links Heirisson Island to Victoria Park. The Causeway ends at a grade-separated partial cloverleaf interchange, located south-east of the second bridge. The interchange links The Causeway with four other roads: Canning Highway to the south-west, Great Eastern Highway to the north-east, and both Shepperton Road and Albany Highway to the south-east. There is no access to Albany Highway from The Causeway, as Albany Highway is a one-way road leading into the interchange.

The reserve is 25 km northeast of the town of Denham in the Shark Bay Marine Park and World Heritage Site. The main attraction are the bottlenose dolphins that have been coming close to shore for more than fifty years. Rangers from the Department of Parks and Wildlife (Western Australia) carefully supervise the interaction between humans and dolphins. History Mia is the Aboriginal term for home or shelter, while the Monkey part of the name is allegedly derived from a pearling boat called Monkey that anchored at the now Monkey Mia in the late 19th century, during the days when pearling was an industry in the region. However, the Geographic Names Committee, hosted by Landgate (the Western Australian Land Information Authority) has stated that the most likely origins of the name are that it was included in a list of Aboriginal names and their meanings supplied by the Geraldton Police Station in approx 1899 (the meaning of the name is given as \\"Salt or bad water\\") or after the pet monkeys owned by early Malay pearlers who camped at the location, or as a colloquialism for \\"sheep\\", or that it was named for a schooner called Monkey that arrived in 1834. The area was originally gazetted in 1890 and used as a base for the pearling and fishing industries. In the 1960s, a fisherman and his wife began feeding bottlenose dolphins when returning with their catch. As news of the dolphins coming inshore spread, visitors started to come to see them. In 1985, an information centre was built, and in 1988, a special state government grant was provided to develop roads, carparks, and facilities. In November 1990, the waters adjoining Monkey Mia were declared a marine park and are managed by the Department of Parks and Wildlife. In recent years, more attention has been given to the Aboriginal roots of the area and their knowledge of the local land. For visitors, the most visible evidence of this change is the culture walks, where visitors are taught to respect the land. These days, a small pod of dolphins from a larger super-pod regularly swim to shore up to three times a day, and on average seven or eight dolphins regularly visit, with up to 20 others visiting less frequently; it can take several years before they gain the confidence. Park rangers closely supervise the interaction and hand out fish to selected visitors, often children, to hand-feed to the dolphins, although visitors are urged not to touch the dolphins. Due to strict management only five adults are fed, with no more than 10% of their daily dietary intake. Research Monkey Mia is also the laboratory location for extensive behavioural and biological research on bottlenose dolphins. Drawn to the area's famous \\"beach dolphins\\", researchers Richard Connor and Rachel Smolker started the Monkey Mia dolphin research project in 1982. Their research interests quickly expanded to include hundreds of the nearby Shark Bay dolphins. Since this visit, scientists have come from prestigious institutions in Australia, North America and Europe. The dolphins have been extensively studied by this international team of scientists since 1984.

The youth wing of KPB/PCB was known as the Communist Youth of Belgium. The party published a newspaper known as Le Drapeau Rouge in French and De Roode Vaan in Dutch.  History  It was formed at a congress in Anderlecht on September 3‚Äì4, 1921. KPB/PCB was formed through the unification of two groups, the Communist Party led by War Van Overstraeten and the Belgian Communist Party led by Joseph Jacquemotte, following a split from the Belgian Workers Party. At the time of its foundation, KPB/PCB had around 500 members.1921-1996: PC KPB/PCB became the Belgian section of the Communist International. The party gained parliamentary presence in 1925, as both Van Overstraeten and Jacquemotte were elected MPs. By 1935 KPB/PCB had 9 deputies in the lower house of parliament and 4 senators. In 1938 it had a membership of about 8,500. During the Second World War, the party had to go underground during German occupation. The party was also closely affiliated with the Partisans Arm√©s, a resistance group during the occupation, however in 1943 much of the party leadership was arrested by German forces. After the end of the war, the party was strengthened and obtained 25% in the parliamentary elections. The party participated in a coalition government with the socialists and the liberals from 1946 to 1947. On August 18, 1950 the party chairman, Julien Lahaut, was assassinated. In the mid 1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 9,890.Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H..

Its literal meaning is \\"free pity/mercy\\", from Norman French fraunch aumoyne, \\"free alms\\", from Late Latin eleemosyna, from Greek (\\"eleƒìmosynƒì\\"), \\"pity, alms\\", from (\\"eleƒìm≈çn\\") \\"merciful\\", from (\\"eleos\\"), \\"pity\\".Collins Dictionary of the English Language, London, 1986; Liddell & Scott's Greek- English Lexicon, Oxford, 1944 By it an ecclesiastical body held land free of military service such as knight service or other secular or religious service, but sometimes in return for the religious service of saying prayers and masses for the soul of the grantor. Not only was secular service not due but in the 12th and 13th centuries jurisdiction over land so held belonged to the ecclesiastical courts, and was thus immune from royal jurisdiction. In English law, frankalmoign(e) was also known as \\"tenure in free alms\\". Gifts to religious institutions in free alms were defined first as gifts to God, then to the patron saint of the religious house, and finally to those religious serving God in the specific house. The following example is from a charter of William de Vernon, 5th Earl of Devon (d.1217), to Quarr Abbey:Worsley, Sir Richard. History of the Isle of Wight, London, 1781, appendix LXVI As the above example makes clear it was a freehold tenure as it was held in perpetual possession, which is equivalent to \\"hereditable\\" in secular terms. Religious houses in receipt of free alms could not recognise a secular lord. The gift of land or other property made over to God and to a patron Saint was inalienable, and the relationship between the grantor and the religious house was subsidiary. In the 12th century the institution came to be misused. Land could be donated to a church organization and then leased back to the donor, allowing the donor to avoid the feudal services due to his lord. Legal cases became so complicated that the Assize of Utrum was established in the middle of the 12th century to adjudicate claims. Thomas de Littleton's Tenures, which perhaps appeared about 1470 as an update of a then century-old predecessor tract (the Old Tenures), said to have been written under Edward III, contains a section on Frankalmoin. Edward Coke commented on this in the first part of his Institutes of the Lawes of England, published within his Commentary upon Littleton, which he completed about a century and a half after its subject's first appearance. Coke provided cases and noted how practice related to Littleton's work had changed during that time. Frankalmoin was the tenure by which the greater number of the monasteries and religious houses held their lands; it was expressly exempted from the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, by which the other ancient tenures were abolished, and it was the tenure by which the parochial clergy and many ecclesiastical and eleemosynary foundations held their lands through the 19th century. As a form of donation, frankalmoin fell into disuse because on any alienation of the land the tenure was converted into socage. An apparent attempt was made to abolish frankalmoin in the Administration of Estates Act 1925; but in any case no fresh grants in frankalmoin, save by the Crown, were possible after Quia Emptores in 1290.

These include Connah's Quay, Shotton, Queensferry, Aston, Garden City, Sealand, Broughton, Bretton, Hawarden, Ewloe, Mancot, Pentre, Saltney and Sandycroft. The population is around 50,000, with a plurality (17,500) living in Connah's Quay. Estimate formed from population of Connah's Quay/Shotton plus Broughton and Saltney which are the welsh parts of the Chester Urban Area Deeside is known for its industry, providing jobs for the people of Cheshire, Merseyside & North Wales. The biggest employment area in Deeside is Deeside Industrial Park, located on the north bank of the Dee on the southern edge of the Wirral peninsula, which has both historical and contemporary significance, and provides Deeside and the surrounding area with jobs in many different industries from construction to food production. Deeside is also home to steel manufacturer Tata Steel and Toyota's highly advanced engine manufacturing plant. HistoryAncient history= Shotton's history dates back around 1000 years to Saxon times. Various settlements within the Deeside area are recorded in the Domesday book (1086) which list them within the Cheshire Hundred of Ati's Cross. They are Aston, Broughton, Clayton, Hawarden, Golftyn and Wepre. The largest of these was Hawarden with 14 households. As a border region, the Deeside area was subject to frequent conflict between the Welsh and the English in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In the Battle of Ewloe in 1157, Owain Gwynedd inflicted a notable defeat on the forces of Henry II. Ewloe Castle was built by Llywelyn the Great in the early thirteenth century to secure the area. Llywelyn's son and successor, Dafydd ap Llywelyn, was borne in nearby Coleshill in 1212. =Recent history= Until industrialisation in the nineteenth century, Shotton remained a cluster of hamlets: a settlement comprising Shotton, Nine Houses and Shotton Hall, which itself dates back to 1637. Coal mining developed in the eighteenth century, then in 1889 the opening of the Hawarden Railway Bridge over the River Dee improved access to the reclaimed Dee Marshes. Following this, in 1895, the Summers family purchased of Dee marshland, on which they established Shotton Steelworks. In September 1896, Shotton Steelworks began producing sheet steel. The development of this steelworks on the banks of the River Dee changed an area that was once mainly marshland, with Shotton ‚Äì just across the Dee ‚Äì previously little more than a hamlet. Shotton Steelworks led to the development of whole communities to house the influx of workers, estimated up to 13,000 at the height of the industry, with Shotton and Connah's Quay Jetty hubs of activity serving the steelworks. There were also brickworks and other industries in and around Shotton, and Connah's Quay developed as a town on the banks of the Dee Estuary, becoming known for its shipbuilding industry. =City of Chester, Wrexham and Deeside= The city of Chester, Wrexham and Deeside is a proposed city region spanning the large urban areas of Wrexham and Chester and the community of Deeside. This would be a unique city in the UK as its boundaries would cross the border on England and Wales. A preliminary report has been issued. Education Primary schools in the area include: Ewloe Green Primary, Well House Primary School, Bryn Deva Primary, Wepre Primary, Ysgol Cae'r Nant (Brookfield Primary), Golftyn Primary, Venerable Edward Morgan, Sealand County Primary, Sandycroft County Primary, St Ethelwold's Primary School, and most importantly, Queenferry County Primary School. Secondary schools in the area include: Connah's Quay High School (Connah's Quay), Elfed School (Buckley), John Summers High School (Queensferry) which closed on 20 July 2017, and St David's High School (Saltney). =Further Education= Coleg Cambria is a large and popular college in Connah's Quay. It offers a range of full and part-time courses as well as apprenticeships. In an inspection in 2007 the college gained the highest possible grade 1 inspection ratings for its Work Based Learning provision, it was formerly Deeside College, but a College Merger was finalised in August 2013 with Yale College Wrexham, It is now one of the largest College's in the UK and the largest in Wales. Transport The Blue Bridge over the River Dee. Bus travel in Deeside is mainly provided by Arriva North West who offer services to Chester Bus Exchange from a starting point in Connah's Quay. Arriva also provide a service to Rhyl in North Wales from Chester which passes through parts of Deeside. Senior citizens are entitled to free public transport to and from Chester. Arriva provide Train services in the Deeside area. The main services are to Liverpool and Manchester and to Wrexham and Rhyl. There are also services to London and Cardiff which call at Shotton railway station. The other three railway stations in Deeside are Shotton high level railway station, Hawarden railway station and Hawarden Bridge railway station. A new station serving Deeside Industrial Estate has been proposed and is currently in the planning stages. =The Deeside Shuttle Bus= The Deeside Shuttle Bus is a service which enables people to travel to and from work at a time convenient to them. The Deeside Shuttle Bus allows local residents to book a seat on the bus at a time and place specified by them, which will take them to work on Deeside Industrial Park. It has proved very popular and has now grown to serve other local areas. Landmarks The most striking landmark in Deeside is the fixed cable-stayed bridge, which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998. The bridge is known as the Flintshire Bridge but is commonly referred to by locals as the \\"New Bridge\\". The industrial park has been used as the base and the service area of the Wales Rally GB every year since 2013. Local mediaTelevision= The Deeside area is covered by both the Moel-y-Parc and the Winter Hill transmitters. The area receives BBC Wales and BBC North West and ITV Wales and ITV Granada although the North West services generally do not provide news coverage of events on the Welsh side of the border. =Radio= Local radio stations include Capital North West and Wales, Chester's Dee 106.3, BBC Radio Merseyside and Radio City 96.7. =Newspapers= There are three main newspapers for Deeside: these are The Evening Leader, a Deeside edition of the Chester Chronicle and a Deeside edition of the Chester and District Standard.

Cummings was born in St. Albans, Vermont, educated at the Hoosac School in New York, studied American art and architectural history at Oberlin College, and received his doctoral degree from Ohio State University in 1950. When young, he spent winters with his parents in Bennington, Vermont, and summers with his grandmother in Southington, Connecticut. In an interview with Laura Beech, Cummings reflected on his grandmother's influence: \\"At a personal level, my grandmother had as much influence as anyone on my life. She was a scientist by training, a Vassar graduate who had studied astronomy. She drilled into me the need to be very factual. I also fell right in with all her genealogical interests.\\" In his teens, Cummings joined the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA, now known as Historic New England), and spent hours at the town clerk's office in Southington, tracing the titles of his ancestors' colonial structures. Elmer Keith, a Wallingford, Connecticut, antiquarian and collector, taught Cummings to deconstruct a building to look behind its repairs and later additions. In graduate school, Cumming's thesis was on Seventeenth Century Massachusetts buildings, and dissertation on the Federal architect Asher Benjamin. Cumming's career mixed academic and museum positions. After receiving his degree in 1948, he taught at Antioch College. In 1951, as colleges began cutting staff due to the Korean War, Cummings lost his academic post and reluctantly became an assistant curator in the American Wing at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1955, Bertram K. Little, then SPNEA director, asked Cummings to join SPNEA as assistant director and editor of Old-Time New England. Cummings eventually succeeded Little as director in 1970. Throughout his term at SPNEA, Cummings continued to lecture and teach. He served as an instructor the New York State Historical Association's summer program in American material culture, Cooperstown, New York. In 1971 Cummings helped to establish Boston University's New England and American Studies Program. In 1982 Cummings taught a course at Yale University on New England architectural history, and in 1984 he was appointed Yale's first Charles F. Montgomery professor of American decorative arts, a position he held until his retirement in 1992. Cummings died at The Elaine Center, Hadley, Massachusetts.

Of all the names of the Old Testament used in the liturgies of the Roman Rite, a special prominence accrues to those of Abel, Melchisedech, and Abraham through their association with the idea of sacrifice and their employment in this connection in the most solemn part of the Canon of the Mass. Abraham's name occurs so often and in such a variety of connections as to give him, among Old Testament figures, a position of eminence in the liturgy, perhaps surpassed by David alone. Roman Martyrology (Martyrologium Romanum) * Abraham is commemorated on 9 October: \\"Commemoratio sancti Abrahae, patriarchae et omnium credentium patris, qui, Domino vocante, ab urbe Ur Chaldaeorum, patria sua, egressus est et per terram erravit eidem et semini eius a Deo promissam.

He also showed complete faith in God when, hoping against hope, he did not refuse to offer in sacrifice his only son Isaac, whom the Lord had granted him when he was already old and his wife was sterile). As thus revised in the 20th century, the Roman Martyrology provides a much more complete picture of Abraham than it did when it limited itself to saying only: \\"Eodem die memoria S. Abrahae Patriarchae et omnium credentium Patris.\\" Roman Ritual (Rituale Romanum) * In the Commendation of the Dying, \\"Abraham, our father in faith\\" and \\"David, leader of God's people\\" are the only two names from the Old Testament mentioned in the special litany.Pastoral Care of the Sick, 219 An earlier form of the rite mentions Abel instead of David. In a prayer of commendation that follows, eight Old Testament names are mentioned, including the invocation \\"Deliver your servant, Lord, as you delivered Abraham from Ur of the Chaldees.\\"Pastoral Care of the Sick, 220 * The Rite of Funerals includes the prayer: \\"Almighty Father, eternal God, hear our prayers for your son (daughter) N. whom you have called from this life to yourself.

In the two-year cycle of readings proposed for the modern Liturgy of the Hours, the narrative of Abraham takes up twelve days (Wednesday of week 2 to Saturday of week 3 on the even-numbered years). * Every day the Liturgy of the Hours mentions Abraham in the Magnificat (last verse: \\"As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham and his seed forever\\") and in the Benedictus (sixth verse: \\"The oath which he swore to Abraham our father\\").

And since he is mentioned in 71 verses of the New Testament alone (41 of them outside the Gospels), his name appears also many times in other parts of the Liturgy of the Hours, especially since in 1970 \\"a more ample selection from the treasury of God's word\\" is included in the Liturgy of the Hours.Apostolic Constitution Laudis canticum Abraham is also mentioned in the antiphon to the Magnificat of Thursday of the Fifth Week of Lent, with reference to the Gospel of that day, which contains Jesus' declaration: \\"Before Abraham was, I am.\\" In the Tridentine Missal this Gospel was read on the fifth Sunday of Lent, which until 1960 was called \\"Passion Sunday\\" and the corresponding Magnificat antiphon was used on that day in the Roman Breviary. Roman Missal (Missale Romanum) * Mention has already been made of the prayer in the Canon of the Mass, when the priest, referring to \\"the holy Bread of eternal life and the Chalice of everlasting salvation\\", prays: \\"Be pleased to look upon them with serene and kindly countenance, and to accept them, as you were pleased to accept the gifts of your servant Abel the just, the sacrifice of Abraham, our father in faith, and the offering of your high priest Melchizedek, a holy sacrifice, a spotless victim.\\" The idea of sacrifice is common to Western and Eastern liturgies, while those of the East, except the Maronite, omit in their epicleses all reference to the typic sacrifices of the Old Testament, and appear concerned with impressing the faithful with the idea rather of sacrament and communion, an element used for classifying liturgies. * The second (in the pre-1950s Missal the third) of the Old Testament readings of the Easter Vigil between the lighting of the Paschal Candle and the Blessing of the Font recounts the sacrifice of Isaac imposed upon Abraham (). Before the early 1950s, the priest read this lesson quietly for himself (as he did for all chants and readings at Mass executed by others, with the sole exception of the Gospel) while it was being chanted for the people, a practice that Pope Pius XII eliminated. The dramatic incidents in this passage of Scripture must have impressed early Christian catechumens deeply, as they are represented on the walls of catacombs and on sarcophagi. The following prayer begins: \\"God and Father of all who believe in you, you promised Abraham that he would become the father of all nations, and through the death and resurrection of Christ you fulfil that promise ...\\". * Until it was removed by Pope Pius XII, another lesson (then the fourth) was followed by the prayer: \\"O God, grant that the fulness of the whole world may pass over to the children of Abraham...\\". *There are now dozens of Scripture readings at Mass that mention Abraham. In the Tridentine Missal they were fewer, but they included the already mentioned and also . Abraham is referred to also explicitly (e.g. \\"May the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, be with you\\") or implicitly (e.g. In figuris praesignatur, cum Isaac immolatur in the Sequence of Corpus Christi) in various other liturgical texts within the Missal. Roman Pontifical (Pontificale Romanum) * In one of the Prefaces of the Consecration of an altar, the bishop says: \\"May it have as much grace with Thee as that which Abraham, the father of faith, built when about to sacrifice his son as a figure of our redemption...\\". Again, in the Blessing of a Cemetery (third Prayer) and in connection with Isaac and Jacob (sixth Prayer). Finally, in two of the Prayers for the Blessing and Coronation of a King. The exalted position of Abraham in Sacred History, and the frequent use of his name in invocations etc. in the Old Testament (e.g. Gen. xxviii, 13; xxxii, 9; xlviii, 15,16; Exod., iii, 6,15,16, iv, 5; Tob., vii, 15 etc.), and the continued use thereof by the early Christians (Acts, iii, 13; vii, 32) made his name of frequent occurrence in prayers and exorcisms.

Individuals with this nationality are British nationals, but are neither British nor Commonwealth citizens. Nationals of this class are subject to immigration controls when entering the United Kingdom and do not have the automatic right of abode there or any other country. This nationality was created to accommodate residents of certain areas that were under British protection or administration but not formally incorporated as Crown dominions. About 1,200 British protected persons currently hold active British passports with this status and enjoy consular protection when travelling abroad.. However, individuals who only hold BPP nationality are effectively stateless as they are not guaranteed the right to enter the country in which they are nationals.  Background  Portions of the British Empire were not incorporated as Crown territory proper and instead considered foreign soil under British suzerainty. These included protectorates, protected states, League of Nations mandates, and United Nations trust territories. Because they were foreign lands, birth in one of these areas did not automatically confer British subject status. Instead, most people associated with these territories were designated as British protected persons. In the 19th century, the term referred to any member of the native populations of protectorates or to a subject of protected state rulers. Over time, it became a substantial form of nationality. Eligibility requirements for the status were initially not well defined.. The designation was given to anyone who was considered to owe allegiance to a local ruler of a state under British protection or who was indigenous to a protectorate without local government. More substantial requirements were codified in 1934; individuals born in protected territories who had no other nationality at birth or those born abroad who would otherwise be stateless to a BPP father, who was himself born in a protected territory, became British protected persons. The status was granted solely by royal prerogative until it was first statutorily defined in the British Nationality Act 1948. As Britain withdrew from its remaining overseas possessions during decolonisation, some protected persons remained BPPs despite the independence of their territories. After almost all protected territories had become independent, Parliament severely restricted acquisition of BPP status in 1978.. The several types of protected territories were differentiated by how their administrative structures were established: * Protected states were territories that had existing organised internal governments and exercised high degrees of autonomy in local governance. Britain was responsible only for external affairs. Subjects of the rulers of these protected states were given BPP status. Former protected states in 1949 that granted statutory BPP status include: Brunei, the Canton and Enderbury Islands, nine Malay states (Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Perlis, Selangor, Terengganu), the Maldives, New Hebrides, the Trucial States, and Tonga. * Protectorates had no preexisting government and were territories where the British had administrative jurisdiction as well control over foreign affairs and defence. There was practically no distinction between a colony and protectorate, except that protectorates were not formally governed within British sovereignty. Former protectorates in 1949 include: Aden, Bechuanaland, Gambia, the Gold Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Sierra Leone, the Solomon Islands, Somaliland, Swaziland, Uganda, and Zanzibar. * League of Nations mandates were territories held under custodianship that were granted after the First World War. United Nations trust territories were those mandated territories that continued to be held under British control after the Second World War. Because the areas that became trust territories did not have internal nationality laws, those regions were treated as if they were protectorates for nationality purposes. Former trust territories in 1949 include: Cameroons, Tanganyika, and Togoland.  Acquisition and loss  Countries entirely or partially composed of former protectorates and trust territories that current British protected persons may originate from (includes the British Solomon Islands in the Pacific Ocean, east of Papua New Guinea) Becoming a British protected person is effectively no longer possible., at para. 19 Registration as a BPP is currently only permitted for individuals who have always been stateless and were born to at least one BPP parent in the United Kingdom or an overseas territory. Prior to decolonisation, individuals born in a protected territory and held no other nationality at birth were British protected persons. The status was transferable by descent to children of BPP fathers (but not mothers) who did not have any other nationality following independence of their territories. until 16 August 1978. BPP status was granted in addition to other British nationality classes; an individual can be both a British citizen and a British protected person. Retaining BPP status past the end of British jurisdiction over a protected territory is dependent on the type of territory it was. Persons connected with former protectorates or trust territories may remain BPPs if they did not acquire citizenship of the relevant countries, while all who were associated with former protected states or mandated territories automatically had the status revoked on independence. For those associated with the British Solomon Islands, BPP retention has the added requirement of never having possessed any other nationality. Additionally, Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who were solely connected with that protectorate lost CUKC status on independence and became BPPs instead.. British protected person status is automatically lost if an individual acquires any other nationality or citizenship after 16 August 1978, including other British nationality classes. It can also be voluntarily relinquished by a declaration made to the Home Secretary, provided that an individual already possesses or intends to acquire another nationality. BPP status may be deprived if it was fraudulently acquired. There is no path to restore BPP status once lost.  Rights and privileges  British protected persons are exempted from obtaining a visa or entry certificate when visiting the United Kingdom for less than six months. When travelling in other countries, they may seek British consular protection. BPPs are also eligible to serve in non-reserved Civil Service posts and enlist in the British Armed Forces. BPPs may become British citizens by registration, rather than naturalisation, after residing in the United Kingdom for more than five years and possessing indefinite leave to remain for more than one year. Registration confers citizenship otherwise than by descent, meaning that children born outside of the UK to those successfully registered will be British citizens by descent. Individuals who become British citizens automatically lose their BPP status. BPPs who do not hold and have not lost any other nationality on or after 4 July 2002 are entitled to register as British citizens..  Restrictions  BPPs who hold no other nationality are de facto stateless because they do not have a right to enter the country that claims them as nationals., at para. 17 The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 allowed these individuals to register as British citizens, after which statelessness was generally resolved for people who were solely BPPs. = United Kingdom = Unlike members of other British nationality classes, British protected persons are not Commonwealth citizens.. BPPs are subject to immigration control and have neither the right of abode nor the right to work in the United Kingdom. They are required to pay a \\"health surcharge\\" to access National Health Service benefits when residing in the UK for longer than six months. They do not have the right to vote in UK elections and are ineligible to stand for election to the House of Commons and local government.. They are additionally barred from being sitting members in the House of Lords. = European Union = Before the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020, full British citizens were European Union citizens.. British protected persons have never been EU citizens and did not enjoy freedom of movement in other EU countries., at para. 19‚Äì27 They were, Annex II. and continue to be, exempted from obtaining visas when visiting the Schengen Area.

It lies between the county town of Mold, and Buckley (which it is contiguous with) in the community of Argoed which had a population of 5837 according to the 2011 census. Mynydd Isa was originally a small hamlet on the north side of the Mold to Buckley road (now the A549 road) just downhill from the now demolished Calvinist chapel. It did not appear on Ordnance Survey maps until 1912. Its placename is Welsh for \\"lowest mountain\\". Another old hamlet nearby was Pant-y-Fownog, on the same road nearer Buckley (centred on the Griffin Inn); although the name was used well into the 1900s on picture postcards of the area and by the local Co-Op shop next to the Inn. The name has long since become disused (except for lending its name to a road in nearby Buckley). Bryn-y-Baal is an old hamlet much enlarged since the 1970s and now contiguous with but not part of Mynydd Isa. Bryn-y-Baal takes its name from a Middle English word \\"bale\\" (rhymes with \\"Carl\\" in arhotic Btitish English) meaning small hill. It was later written in a Welsh language form as 'b√¢l' with a circumflex over the \\"√¢\\". In Welsh this is pronounced as a long A. This form appears on early Ordnance Survey maps. Eventually it was written in the Anglicised form 'Baal' - still correctly pronounced to rhyme with \\"Carl\\".Flintshire Place Names by Hwyl Wyn Owen (1995) In the area there is a secondary school known as Argoed High School in Bryn-y-Baal and a primary school Ysgol Mynydd Isa - the Junior department being in Bryn-y-Baal (formerly Ysgol y Bryn and before that Mynydd Isa Junior School), and the Infants department (formerly known as Wat's Dyke Infant School) on a separate site in Mynydd Isa. The local community council is Argoed Community Council (Cyngor Cymunedol Argoed) - Argoed being the name of the ancient township which had covered the area since the Middle Ages, which also gives its name to the local secondary school. Amenities include a pub, The Griffin on Mold Road. (The Mercia on Mercia Drive closed in 2010, and is now a supermarket), various shops and the village centre which houses a cafe 'Caffi Isa', a community interest group located in the old library and other clubs and associations.

Childhood The son of Goh Kim Lok, a merchant, and Siew Han Ch'ng, Goh was the youngest of nine children. His Chinese parents spoke Mandarin and brought up their children with very traditional values. Goh was influenced by and followed in the path of three of his older siblings to train as a dancer. Performance tours to Singapore from overseas ballet companies stimulated their interest in dance. His elder sister Goh Soo Nee Âê¥Á¥†Â¶Æ trained at the Royal Ballet School in London and returned to Singapore to co-found the Singapore Ballet Academy. His elder brother Goh Choo Chiat Âê¥ËØ∏Êù∞ also trained at the Royal Ballet, later became a principal dancer in the Beijing Ballet, and is the artistic director of the Goh Ballet Academy in Vancouver, British Columbia. Another sister, Goh Soo Khim Âê¥Á¥†Áê¥, trained at the Australian Ballet and co-founded Singapore Dance Theatre in 1988. Education Goh went to school at the Nanyang Primary School and proceeded to Raffles Institution. Goh's earliest desire was to become an airline pilot, but his studies in ballet, taught by his sister, Soonee Goh, led him towards his eventual career path as a dancer. At his father's insistence, he first completed his University education and graduated with a degree in Bio-chemistry from the University of Singapore. Early career In 1970 Goh travelled to Europe in hope of finding a position in a ballet company and was offered a place with the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam after first dancing in Lausanne, Switzerland and with the Scarpino Ballet in Amsterdam. The company had a rich blend of classical and contemporary choreography. Goh joined as a member of the corps de ballet and was eventually elevated to soloist with the company during his five years with the company. He excelled in works by the company's resident choreographers, Toer van Schayk and Rudi van Dantzig, as well as in works by Balanchine and Petipa. While still a dancer with the company, Goh created his first ballets in a workshop environment. These small ballets brought him to the attention of Mary Day, director of the Washington School of Ballet in Washington, DC. Believing in his talent, she offered him a position with her newly founded Washington Ballet in 1976. Goh saw this as a chance to grow along with the pace of the development of the new company and took on the responsibilities of company teacher and resident choreographer at their inception as a professional company. Over the course of the next few years his work became increasingly sophisticated and definitive works like Fives (1978), using Ernest Bloch's Concerto Grosso began to emerge. Goh came to the notice of several important artistic directors of dance companies, including the Pacific Northwest Ballet and the Dance Theater of Harlem as word of mouth spread that his talent was producing works of a very high quality. Many noted that his work was filled with a usage of classical ballet vocabulary that seemed influenced by his Asian heritage. His vision was more \\"symphonic\\" in that he utilized numerous soloist dancers in a ballet rather than the traditional principal dancer/corps de ballet arrangement typical in classical choreography. For the Houston Ballet he created two new works (1979 & 1980) and for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater he created Spectrum (1981). American Ballet Theatre commissioned Configurations to be created for Mikhail Baryshnikov soon after. His only full-length work, Romeo and Juliet, to Prokofiev's famous score, was created for the Boston Ballet in 1984. Goh maintained his work with the Washington Ballet as a primary commitment, creating one or two new works each year in addition to re-staging for them some of the successful ballets he was now creating for other companies. He was given the position of associate director of the company in addition to retaining his title as resident choreographer. The city of Washington presented him with the Mayor's Award for Excellence in the Arts in 1986. The Washington Ballet gained international notice due to Goh's work with the dancers in the company. Alan M. Kriegsman, Dance critic for The Washington Post, wrote that Goh \\"has propelled the Washington Ballet to international status on the jetstream of his talent...\\" (February 21, 1985) The company conducted its first large scale overseas tour in 1984 and over the next few years performed in Europe, South America, and the Far East repeatedly, featuring programmes of Goh's choreography. In addition to Fives, some of the most well-known works he created for the Washington Ballet include Variations Serieuses, \\"Double Contrasts\\", Birds of Paradise, In the Glow of the Night, Unknown Territory, and Schubert Symphony. All of these ballets went on to enjoy performances with other companies worldwide. He remained committed to the Washington Ballet and gave a substantial portion of each year to his work with them. Goh's demanding schedule in the 1980s included ballets with Bat Dor Dance Company, the Paris Opera Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet, Joffrey Ballet and the Royal Swedish Ballet. Singapore recognized his talent as a choreographer by presenting him with the Cultural Medallion in 1987, the country's highest award for artistic achievement. Death and legacy In 1987 Goh became seriously ill and after a very brief illness died on 28 November 1987 of an AIDS-related disease, viral colitis, at his home in New York City. Before his death he had decided that a foundation to further choreographic endeavors would be part of his legacy. Janek Schergen was chosen by Mr. Goh to be the artistic director of this endeavour. The Choo San Goh & H. Robert Magee Foundation was formed in 1992 and the centerpiece of it is its annual Choo San Goh Award for Choreography. Since that time numerous choreographers and dance companies have been given financial awards to create new dance works in an effort to further develop choreographic talent. The foundation also oversees the licensing of Goh's ballets in performances by dance companies throughout the world. Singapore Dance Theatre has added to their repertoire twelve of Goh's works, bringing his unique identity as a Singaporean choreographer back to his homeland. In 1997 Singapore Dance Theatre commissioned a monograph on Goh entitled Goh Choo San, Master Craftsman in Dance. It contains a detailed overview of his life in written text and photos of his ballets. Singapore Dance Theatre mounted a successful retrospective of his works in 2007 entitled Legacy. Obituaries were published in the New York Times and the Washington Post on November 30, 1987. Personal life Goh had an elder brother, Choo Chiat Goh, who founded the Goh Ballet Academy in Vancouver, B.C. His niece (daughter of Choo Chiat Goh), Chan Hon Goh was a principal dancer with the National Ballet of Canada and the Suzanne Farrell Ballet, Washington, D.C. His youngest sister Goh Soo Khim is co-founder and former artistic director of Singapore Dance Theatre, and elder sister Soo Nee Goh taught ballet in Vancouver B.C.

It operated on a portion of the MAX light rail system, and for a brief time also operated on the Portland Streetcar system, in downtown and nearby areas. Service was provided with replicas of a type of Brill streetcar, nicknamed the \\"Council Crest\\" cars, which last served Portland in 1950.Mayer, James (November 30, 1991). \\"Clang, clang, clang went Portland's new trolleys\\". The Oregonian, p. B2. The service was managed by Vintage Trolley Inc., a non-profit corporation, and the cars were owned and operated by TriMet, Portland's transit agency. For 18 of its 23 years, the service followed a section of what is now the MAX Blue Line, between Lloyd Center and the west end of downtown. In September 2009, the route was changed to a section of the MAX system, along the transit mall in downtown Portland, from Union Station to Portland State University (PSU). Introduced in 1991, Vintage Trolley service operated on most weekends or at least most Sundays, from March through December, in all past years through 2010, and ran seven days a week from 1994 through 1999. However, starting in 2011 the service was heavily reduced, operating on just seven dates per year,Tramways & Urban Transit, April 2011, p. 152. LRTA Publishing Ltd. and it remained at that reduced level for its final four seasons. Rides were narrated by a conductor who identified historic points of interest along the way. After May 1994, rides were free, but donations were accepted. On December 22, 2013, the service operated for what was, at the time, scheduled to be the last time,Tramways & Urban Transit, February 2014, p. 92. UK: LRTA Publishing Ltd. as a result of a decision by TriMet on December 11 to sell the two remaining Gomaco-built Brill-replica streetcars (511 and 512) to a group planning a streetcar line in St. Louis, Missouri. Earlier in 2013, the other two Gomaco cars were transferred from Portland Vintage Trolley service to the Willamette Shore Trolley (WST) fleet, although their entry into service there was delayed to 2014Willamette Shore Trolley's Facebook page, August 4, 2014. Retrieved July 6, 2019. (and one of the two cars was not moved to the WST line until 2014). However, after the transfer of streetcars 511 and 512 to St. Louis was delayed from spring to September 2014, TriMet scheduled two additional dates of Vintage Trolley service: May 25 and July 6, 2014, and the latter was the final day of service. HistoryEarly history= The cars were replicas of trolley cars that served Portland's Council Crest line from 1904 to 1950, and carried this marketing slogan that had once been worn by the original cars. Portland Vintage Trolley service began operation on November 29, 1991, on a section of TriMet's first MAX line, between Lloyd Center and Galleria/SW 10th Avenue station in the West End of downtown, including crossing the Willamette River on the Steel Bridge. The idea of operating vintage streetcars in Downtown Portland had been proposed at least as early as the mid-1970s,\\"Old Town trolleys proposed\\". (August 25, 1976). The Oregonian, p. E12. as a way to lure back to the city center shoppers who increasingly preferred suburban shopping malls. One of its most enthusiastic and influential proponents was Portland businessman Bill NaitoAlesko, Michael (December 13, 1979). \\"Trolley proposal advances\\". The Oregonian, p. D3. Federman, Stan (January 29, 1987). \\"Tri-Met trolley plan gets go-ahead bell\\". The Oregonian, p. B2. (who later became the first president of Vintage Trolley, Inc.).Mayer, James (November 27, 1991). \\"Rose City went off its trolley 41 years ago; it has returned\\". The Oregonian. However, the idea only finally began to garner growing support following the 1978 approval to construct a light rail system in Portland, the \\"Banfield Light Rail\\" project, renamed Metropolitan Area Express, or MAX, shortly before its 1986 opening. Another impetus for the plans was a concern by the Portland Historical Landmarks Commission that introducing a modern light rail system would have a detrimental impact on the character of two downtown historic districts though which the line would pass, the Skidmore/Old Town and Yamhill Historic Districts. Operating vintage streetcars during off- peak hours was seen as a way of alleviating those impacts. At the service's Lloyd Center station, on NE 11th Avenue at Multnomah Street, on the route followed until 2009 Plans to operate a vintage trolley service on a portion of the MAX line were approved by TriMet in 1987. Some of the costs would be paid by TriMet, some by the federal government, and some by Vintage Trolley, Inc. An order for three replica trolleys was placed \\"Antique trolleys to return\\" (February 28, 1989). The Oregonian. (a fourth car was added later), a carbarn was built in the Coliseum (now Rose Quarter) area, and a short length of track and overhead wire were built along Northeast 11th Avenue near Lloyd Center mall. The first two vehicles, numbered 511 and 514, were delivered in August and November 1991, respectively, and service was inaugurated on November 29, 1991, operating daily for the first month. The third car, No. 513, arrived in January. Car 512, the last arrival and the only one of the four to be completed in 1992, was delivered on April 23, 1992, and entered service on June 21 of that year. From 1992 through May 1994, service was provided on weekends and holidays only, and suspended for the months of January and February each year (except the first year). However, midday service (10 a.m. to 3 p.m.) on weekdays was usually provided during the month of December to entice more shoppers to downtown and the Lloyd Center during the holiday shopping season. From mid-1994 through 1999, Portland Vintage Trolley service operated seven days a week, March through December. Hours of operation were 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends and holidays and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mondays to Fridays. In 2000, Vintage Trolley service was reduced to Sundays only, and the hours reduced slightly, to noon to 6.Tramways & Urban Transit, April 2000, p. 150. Ian Allan Publishing/Light Rail Transit Association (UK). This reduction came about in part because TriMet had opened a second light rail line in September 1998, with a resultant doubling of the frequency of service along the section of the MAX line used by the faux-vintage streetcars. An additional reason was that a trust fund originally set up to pay for the operation had become mostly depleted by this time; TriMet took over most financial responsibility for the service in 2000. Until the end of May 1994, the fare to ride the Vintage Trolley was $1.00, valid for a round trip. However, fares were eliminated effective June 1994; all rides were then free, and continued to be free for the remainder of Vintage Trolley's existence (but donations were accepted). This was the case even though the route extended outside what were then the boundaries of TriMet's Fareless Square free-ride area. (Fareless Square was expanded in 2001 and then encompassed the entire Vintage Trolley route. It was renamed the \\"Free Rail Zone\\" in 2010, but was discontinued in 2012.) =Operation on the Portland Streetcar line= A Vintage Trolley passing Powell's Books, on the Portland Streetcar line, in 2001 From mid-2001 through 2005, Portland Vintage Trolley also served a second route, operating on the Portland Streetcar line from Northwest Portland to Portland State University (PSU) on Saturdays and Sundays, year-round. Two of the four streetcars (Nos. 513 and 514) were transferred from TriMet to the City of Portland in 2001 for use on the new Portland Streetcar line, while the other two cars remained with TriMet for continued use on the original Vintage Trolley route. Car 514 was moved (towed) to the new line from TriMet's trolley carbarn next to Rose Quarter MAX station on January 7, 2001. It was used for the first test trips on the line's first completed section (in Northwest Portland) later that month, because the first modern ≈†koda car had not yet been delivered. It was then decided that the two replica-vintage streetcars should receive a few modifications before entering service, primarily the addition of exterior mirrors and turn signals, which had been omitted when they were built in 1991 because the 1903 cars on which they were based had lacked them. These features had been viewed as unnecessary when these cars were operating only on the MAX line, because they were using separate lanes not shared with other traffic, but on the new streetcar line they would be mixing with general traffic. These modifications were made to both cars before they entered service, but car 513 was not moved to the new line until September 2001. The Portland Streetcar line opened on July 20, 2001, and Vintage Trolley service on it began on July 28.Thompson, Richard M. (2006). Portland's Streetcars, pp. 125‚Äì126. Arcadia Publishing. . On this route, one Vintage Trolley car (of two available) was used at any given time, providing hourly service and replacing a regularly scheduled modern ≈†koda streetcar. Originally, it was predicted that the two Vintage Trolleys would be needed as spares on the Portland Streetcar line, in case more than one modern car were unavailable for the scheduled service, but the modern cars proved to be sufficiently reliable that the use of vintage trolley cars as spares was never needed. Vintage Trolley service on Portland Streetcar was temporarily suspended around the end of November 2005,Tramways & Urban Transit, March 2007, p. 108. Ian Allan Publishing/Light Rail Transit Association. in part because of maintenance problems with the two cars, and in part because the opening of the Portland Streetcar's extension from PSU to RiverPlace in March 2005 caused operations difficulties with the Vintage Trolley cars. This suspension eventually became permanent, and after November 2005 Portland Vintage Trolley operated only on its original route, between Downtown Portland and Lloyd Center, until that route was also discontinued (modified), in mid-2009. =2009 route change= City Hall from 2009 to 2014. Until mid-2009, the Portland Vintage Trolley continued to serve the route it had followed since opening 18 years earlier, from the Lloyd District to Galleria/SW 10th Avenue station in downtown Portland, running on Sundays from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m., half-hourly, using two cars, but the final day of service along that route was August 23, 2009. In September 2009, the service was changed to a completely different route, but which is also a section of the MAX system. Commencing on September 13, 2009, Vintage Trolley service operated along the recently rebuilt Portland Transit Mall, on 5th and 6th Avenues in downtown, between Union Station and Portland State University. The service now used only one car and ran from 10:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. on its days of operation, which initially continued to include most Sundays from March through December. Passengers were permitted to board or alight at any of the MAX stations along the route. A round trip took approximately 30 minutes, and the headway varied between 30 minutes and 45 minutes. =2011 reduction= Effective in 2011, the service was heavily reduced, as a result of budgetary constraints caused by the recession's impact on TriMet's finances, from about 30‚Äì35 dates per year in recent years to just seven dates. Although the 2011 schedule included Vintage Trolley service on every Sunday during the peak holiday shopping season, in the last weeks of the year, otherwise the only scheduled operating dates of the entire year were the three Sundays nearest to Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day -- specifically May 29, July 3 and September 4, 2011. The route, frequency and hours of operation (on days of operation) remained unchanged. The schedule of operating dates followed the same pattern in subsequent years, and the scheduled dates of operation in 2013 were May 26, July 7, September 1, and four consecutive Sundays from December 1 through December 22. Even after TriMet discontinued Fareless Square (latterly known as the Free Rail Zone), in downtown, rides on Vintage Trolley remained free, but donations were welcomed. =Discontinuation= In early 2013, it was announced that two of the four replica \\"Council Crest\\" streetcars, Nos. 513 and 514, would be transferred to the Willamette Shore Trolley line, to replace a historic streetcar that had been serving that line since 1996 but had broken down in 2010 and not been repaired. Car 514 was moved to the Willamette Shore Trolley line in March 2013, and car 513 was moved on September 8, 2014. Those two cars had not run in service since the end of Vintage Trolley operation on the city-owned Portland Streetcar line, in 2005. All Vintage Trolley service on the TriMet-owned MAX system since 2001 had used cars 511 and 512. On December 6, 2013, TriMet announced that it had tentatively decided to sell the two remaining cars (511 and 512) to a group in St. Louis, Missouri, which was planning to build a heritage streetcar line there, the Delmar Loop Trolley. The TriMet board approved the sale on December 11, after which the final two days of Vintage Trolley service were December 15 and December 22, 2013. At that time, TriMet indicated that the two trolleys were expected to be moved to St. Louis in mid-2014, but in April 2014 TriMet posted a more precise date for the planned move, of August 2014, and noted on its newly reinstated Vintage Trolley web page that the service would operate on two dates in 2014, May 25 and July 6, with the latter being the (revised) final day of service. The service ran for the last time on July 6, 2014, as planned, and cars 511 and 512 left Portland for St. Louis on September 9, 2014. The cars One of the original 1903/04 Portland Brill streetcars on which the design of the \\"Vintage Trolley\\" cars was based, shown at the Oregon Electric Railway Museum (its old site) in 1986 Interior of one of the faux-vintage streetcars The unusual type of current collector used by the Portland Gomaco cars The four streetcars/trolleys‚Äîthese two terms are synonyms in most parts of the United StatesYoung, Andrew D. (1997). Veteran & Vintage Transit (). St. Louis: Archway Publishing.‚Äîwere built by the Gomaco Trolley Company, of Ida Grove, Iowa, in 1991 and early 1992. They were designed to replicate, as closely as practicable, a design of streetcar which the J. G. Brill Company supplied to Portland in 1904. Those ten cars were originally numbered 201‚Äì210, but were renumbered 501‚Äì510 in 1905Labbe, John (1980). Fares, Please! Those Portland Trolley Years, p. 120. Caldwell, Idaho: The Caxton Printers Ltd. . and kept those numbers for the remainder of their working lives, which ended in 1950 with the abandonment of Portland's last three city streetcar lines. Although Brill cars 501‚Äì510 were not restricted to the Council Crest route, they provided all of the service on that line, and so came to be known by Portlanders as the \\"Council Crest cars\\". Two of the original Council Crest streetcars, 503 and 506, are preserved by the Oregon Electric Railway Historical Society at its museum in Brooks, Thompson, Richard M. (2006). Portland's Streetcars, p. 110. Arcadia Publishing. . and Gomaco was able to use those cars as patterns for the replicas. The first of the faux-vintage trolley cars, No. 511, arrived on August 16, 1991, while the last arrival, No. 512, was delivered on April 23, 1992. The four cars built in 1991‚Äì92 by Gomaco have the same red-and-cream colors as the original 1904 cars and include most of the latter's features, such as padded rattan seats with reversible backrests, carved oak interiors, brass handrails, pull-down window shades and doors which can only be manually opened and closed, by the motorman (operator) or conductor. They were given fleet numbers 511‚Äì514 as a continuation of the earlier cars' number series, and in tribute to them. On the front of the replica Vintage Trolleys is painted a slogan that once adorned the ends of their antecedents, See Portland from Council Crest, a reference to the views of the city available from the route's upper terminus, atop Council Crest. The old trolleys had all-wood bodies, whereas the replicas have steel frames, concealed by wood, for better safety and durability. Because they would be sharing the same tracks as MAX, they also were equipped with a more modern style of current collector to draw power from the overhead wires, a cross between a pantograph (the type of collector used by MAX) and a bow collector, instead of the trolley poles which the city's original trolley cars used.

Allen Smith Harry Allen Wolfgang Smith\\"The Press: Totem Column,\\" Time (magazine), November 10, 1941. (December 19, 1907‚ÄîFebruary 24, 1976) was an American journalist, humorist, and author whose books were popular in the 1940s and 1950s.  Family and early career  Smith was born in McLeansboro, Illinois, where he lived until the age of six. His family moved to Decatur in 1913 and then to Defiance, Ohio, finally arriving in Huntington, Indiana. It was at this point Smith dropped out of high school and began working odd jobs, eventually finding work as a journalist. He began in 1922 at the Huntington Press, relocating to Jeffersonville, Indiana, and Louisville, Kentucky. In Florida, editing the Sebring American in 1925, he met society editor Nelle Mae Simpson, and they married in 1927. The couple lived in Oklahoma, where Smith worked at the Tulsa Tribune, followed by a position at the Denver Post. In 1929, he became a United Press rewrite man, also handling feature stories and celebrity interviews. He continued as a feature writer with the New York World-Telegram from 1934 to 1939. World War II bestsellers He found fame when his humor book Low Man on a Totem Pole (1941) became a bestseller during WWII, popular not only on the home front but also read on troop trains and at military camps. Featuring an introduction by his friend Fred Allen, it eventually sold over a million copies. Damon Runyon called it, \\"Rich funny stuff, loaded with laughs.\\" As noted by Eric Partridge in A Dictionary of Catch Phrases, the book's title became a catchphrase for the least successful individual in a group. With his newfound financial freedom, he left the daily newspaper grind for life as a freelance author, scripting for radio while also writing (for six months) The Totem Pole, a daily column for United Features Syndicate, making personal appearances and working on his next book, Life in a Putty Knife Factory (1943), which became another bestseller. He spent eight months in Hollywood as a screenwriter for Paramount Pictures, and wrote about the experience in Lost in the Horse Latitudes (1944). His first three books were widely circulated around the world in Armed Services Editions. The popularity of these titles kept Smith on the New York Herald Tribune's Best Seller List for 100 weeks and prompted a collection of all three in 3 Smiths in the Wind (1946). By the end of World War II, Smith's fame as a humorist was such that he edited Desert Island Decameron (1945), a collection of essays and stories by such leading humorists as Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley and James Thurber. Histories of the Manhattan Project mention Desert Island Decameron because Donald Hornig was reading it when he was sitting in the Trinity Test tower babysitting the atomic bomb on July 15, 1945, the stormy night prior to the first nuclear explosion. Later writing His novel, Rhubarb (1946), about a cat that inherits a professional baseball team, led to two sequels and a 1951 film adaptation. Larks in the Popcorn (1948, reprinted in 1974) and Let The Crabgrass Grow (1960) described \\"rural\\" life in Westchester County, New York. People Named Smith (1950) offers anecdotes and histories of people named Smith, such as Presidential candidate Al Smith, religious leader Joseph Smith and a man named 5/8 Smith. He collaborated with Ira L. Smith on the baseball anecdotes in Low and Inside (1949) and Three Men on Third (1951). The Compleat Practical Joker (1953, reprinted in 1980) detailed the practical jokes pulled by his friends Hugh Troy, publicist Jim Moran and other pranksters, such as the artist Waldo Peirce. His futuristic fantasy novel, The Age of the Tail (1955), describes a time when people are born with tails. One of his last books was Rude Jokes (1970). Smith also wrote hundreds of magazine articles for Esquire, Holiday, McCall's, Playboy, Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post, The Saturday Review of Literature, True, Venture, Golf and other publications. Smith made a number of appearances on radio and television. Fred Allen was one of his friends, and he was a guest on The Fred Allen Show on December 7, 1947 and January 9, 1949. On June 28, 1959, he was interviewed by Edward R. Murrow on Person to Person. Smith's autobiography, To Hell in a Handbasket, was published in 1962. H. Allen and Nelle Smith lived in Mount Kisco, New York, for 23 years before relocating to Alpine, Texas, in 1967. He died in San Francisco, and his last book, The Life and Legend of Gene Fowler,MacAdams, William. Review: The Life and Legend of Gene Fowler was published posthumously in 1977. His papers are in special collections at Sul Ross State University (Alpine, Texas) and Southern Illinois University (Carbondale, Illinois). The SIU photograph collection contains pictures of Smith, his family, friends and celebrities. Chili champ Allen competed with Wick Fowler in the first Chili Cookoff in history, held in Terlingua, Texas in October 1967. The competition ended in a tie. According to his book, The Great Chili Confrontation, three judges sampled the chili. Smith and Fowler received one vote each with a third judge uttering a decision that was undiscernable to either competitors or attendees. Smith competed with the following recipe: Smith claimed to have downed the first legal drink in the United States once prohibition was repealed with the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, and he wrote about the incident in Chapter VI of Life in a Putty Knife Factory. However, others also claimed to have taken the first Repeal drink; in New York City, Joe Weber of the comedy team Weber and Fields took the first legal drink with several reporters as his witnesses.

Biography  Little is known about his life. He was born in Vienna and later moved to Tyrnau in Austria, although some suggest Trnava (), in modern-day Slovakia. He studied under Abraham Klausner of Vienna and R' Shalom of Neustadt. It is possible that he later served as rabbi in Pressburg, although this is debated by scholars. His correspondence with the Maharil regarding a divorce (1420) is recorded. Gabriel Polak and Israel B√∂hmer published (K√∂nigsberg, 1857) an anonymous story entitled \\"Etzba Elohim,\\" the heroes of which are Isaac Tyrnau and his beautiful daughter. According to legend, a Hungarian prince fell in love with Tyrnau's daughter, converted to Judaism, renounced the throne and married Tyrnau's daughter.  Works  The Sefer haMinhagim (Book of Customs) is a compendium of halachot (\\"Jewish laws\\") and minhagim (\\"customs\\") of various groups of Ashkenazi Jews, arranged according to the calendar. The work is significantly influenced by those of Tyrnau's teachers. It also contains notes from a Hungarian rabbi, which were already attached with the first printed edition of Tyrnau's work (1566).Seforim Online It is quoted by Mordechai Jaffe at the end of his \\"Lebush\\" on Orah Hayyim. As Tyrnau states in the foreword of the book, his intention was to unify the customs. The Black Death around 1348 had almost completely destroyed the German Jewish communities. The number of scholars had diminished so much that in some places \\"there were only two or three persons who had a real knowledge of local customs\\". Tyrnau's work is noted as the first to discuss in detail the idea of the Yahrzeit (the commemoration of the anniversary of a death). It was translated into German in 1590, and often reprinted. It also contains a treatise on morals entitled \\"Orhot Hayyim,\\" in 132 sections, which is appended to the Sefer haMinhagim. This work was to some extent superseded by Minhagei Maharil by Rabbi Yaakov ben Moshe Levi Moelin (Maharil), 1556.

Braking can be achieved by lowering the back of the foot so that sole contacts the ground. Roger Adams patented Heelys in 1999. The headquarters are located in Carrollton, Texas. Injuries The journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics published a study of injuries resulting from the use of Heelys (and Street Gliders, a similar product that is strapped onto regular shoes). The study counted only significant injuries that required assessment by an orthopedic surgeon, ignoring minor injuries that were treated solely in the emergency department. The 10-week study (conducted during summer school holiday), found: * An injury rate of approximately 51 injuries per 100,000 children (for injuries requiring orthopedic attention; the rate for less- serious injuries is unknown, but presumably much higher). For comparison, in 1997 the United States, nonfatal dog bites required 151 emergency department visits per 100,000 population (including adults). * 34% of the injuries were suffered by children using Heelys (or Street Gliders) for the very first time. 70% had used the products five or fewer times. * The injuries comprised 8% of the workload for the pediatric orthopedic department. * 12% of the injured children were familiar with the instructions for use of the products. Protective equipment The manufacturer says, \\"We highly recommend [the use of protective gear] when the wheels are in the shoes.\\" Most users do not wear protective gear because the shoes are worn for everyday use (unlike more specialized sporting equipment such as inline skates). Tricks Advanced Heelys users can perform tricks such as spins, backwards skating and skating on one foot. There are four categories of tricks used in heeling: ground tricks, grinding tricks, stalling tricks and vert tricks. * Ground tricks ‚Äì the main category of tricks used in heeling. * Grinds ‚Äì these tricks can only be performed if the model has a nylon pad in the shoe, it involves jumping on a surface, landing on the nylon pad and sliding across the surface. * Stalls ‚Äì generally involves jumping onto a raised object and pausing before jumping off and heeling once more. * Vert ‚Äì any type of tricks performed on a vert ramp. * Flips - usually performed on a trampoline or off a high surface that has a soft surface under.

It was founded by Mir Damad and reached its fullest development in the work of Mulla Sadra. The name was coined by Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Henry Corbin. Because of the attention of Shah Abbas during the Safavid Dynasty in Iran to intellectual tradition in Islam, Isfahan became a famous academic city and the intellectual center of Iran at the time, along with the cities of Rey and Shiraz. Historical context This school of thought began to develop once Iran was economically and politically stable. The Safavid court also provided funding for the arts, which also contributed to the development. At the time, there were many disputes between Shiite scholars, such as Ahamad Alavi, and Christian and Jewish scholars. In this period the intellectual life of Suhrevardi was revived by Mir Damad and Mulla Sadra. According to Seyyed Hosein Nasr, this school of thought plays an important role both in terms of the relation between philosophy and prophecy, and in the training of Mulla Sadra. The school of Isfahan is a subsidiary of the Shiraz school of philosophy. Several philosophers that were not part of the Shiraz school of thought had very important roles in preparing the Isfahan school, such as Ibn Turkah, Qadi Maybudi and Ibn Abi Jomhour Ahsaei. The group of founders then announced Shia as formal religion in Persia, in an attempt to unify the entire country, with Isfahan as their capital. =Founder= Mir Damad founded the Isfahan philosophical school. He was the nephew of Muhaqiq Karaki, an important Shia scholar who had influence in the Shia jurisprudence. Some consider him familiar with philosophical prophecy as a result to the problem of Time. Corbin describes Mir Damad as having an analytic mind and aware of religious foundation of knowledge. Perhaps the most important characteristic of Mira Damad's philosophy is a synthesis between Avicennism and Averroism, or his synthesis is between the intellectual and the spiritual. Mir Damad's theory on Time is as popular as Huduth Dahri's, though Damad's philosophical opinion is criticized by Huduth's pupil, Mulla Sadra. Historically, there was great strife between Mulla Sadra and Mir Damad, as a result of the differences of their philosophical theories on subjects such as time. =Other teachers=Mir Fendereski Mir Abul Qasim Findiriski was a peripatetic philosopher and follower of Farabi an Avicenna. He select a Peripatetic stance, as opposed to the illuminationists. As a scholar, He taught several scientific subjects in the physical Isfahan school, such as mathematics and Medicine. it is debated whether or not Mulla Sadra studied under him, though the two worked together extensivally. Mir Findiriski also studied other religions, such as Zoroastrianism and Hindi. He also wrote several works on Indian philosophy, a series of treatises on fine arts, and one on his mystical experiences. According to Nasr, he was all well rounded in different philosophy, poetry, alchemy, and the philosophy of Yoga. Mir Findiriski collaborated with Mir Damad to wrote a piece called the Treatise of Sanaiyyah attempting to link philosophy and prophecy. Mir Findiriski also attempted to translate several Indian philosophical works into Persian. Shaykh-i Baha‚Äôi Shaykh-i Baha‚Äôi was one of the three masters of Mulla Sadra, worked in the Isfahan school, and served as chief jurist on the Safavid Court. Like many Islamic scholars of the era, he was both a scientist and a man of wisdom; like Mir Damad and Mir Fenedereski, he was skilled in several sciences. At the time, he attempted to harmonize the relationship between Shariah and Tariqah. He coined the term Hikmate Yamani (wisdom of believing.) He believed that humans were the only being capable of intelligence in a philosophy called \\"The Place of Illumination for Existence\\".

The film's stop-motion animation special effects were created by Willis O'Brien. Plot An earthquake strikes Mexico, resulting in the overnight birth of a new volcano. Geologists Dr. Hank Scott and Dr. Arturo Ramos are dispatched to study this crisis at the village of San Lorenzo, the two men finding a destroyed house and a totaled police car en route. They find a dead policeman nearby, and an abandoned and seemingly orphaned infant. They take the infant to San Lorenzo and give it to friends of the child's missing parents, while being welcomed by the village's priest, Father Delgado. Delgado reveals the property damage is caused by something that is slaughtering the livestock, the villagers believing the culprit to be a demon bull and have been pestering Delgado for divine assistance. Undaunted, Hank and Arturo begin their geological survey as members of the Mexican army under Major Cosio arrive in San Lorenzo to begin disaster-relief efforts. Hank meets and falls in love with local rancher Teresa Alvarez, and makes friends with a young boy named Juanito. When the volcano erupts again, the culprits behind the disappearances and deaths are revealed as giant prehistoric scorpions. After killing a crew of telephone repairmen, the scorpions attack San Lorenzo with the Mexican military unable to harm them. The next morning, the scorpions have returned to their underground lair (which is also home to giant worms and spiders), leaving the authorities to seek the help of renowned entomologist Dr. Velasco. Velasco enlists Hank and Arturo to figure out means of destroying the scorpions or seal off the entrance to the cavern. Despite collapsing the cave entrance, the giant scorpions took refuge in the caves before resurfacing days later to attack a train. Some of the passengers are killed as in-fighting among the scorpions resolves with the largest of them killing the others before heading for Mexico City. Hank and Arturo come up with a plan to lure it to a stadium with a truckload of meat, with the military distracting it long enough for Hank to kill it by shooting an electric cable attached to a spear into its throat, which is its only vulnerable spot. After destroying several tanks and helicopters, the surviving fighters detonate the electric charge, finally slaying the last scorpion.

Pete Peterson, who worked with O'Brien on Mighty Joe Young and would again on The Giant Behemoth, did most of the actual hands-on animation. O'Brien borrowed heavily from his previous films for the stop-motion special effects. The miniatures used for the trapdoor spider and the giant tentacled worm have been reported to be the same ones that were used in the now \\"Lost Spider Pit Sequence\\" from the original King Kong (1933). The trapdoor spider model matches precisely the smaller spider model seen in behind-the-scenes stills from King Kong. Biographers, however, dispute whether O'Brien saved his models, and Ray Harryhausen's An Animated Life noted that many models used in King Kong were still in storage at RKO in the 1950s, by which time many were decayed. The sounds made by the giant scorpions were reminiscent of the giant ant sound effects used in Them! A large-scale scorpion \\"head\\" was used for close-up reaction shots.

He returned to Paris, where he completed the famous \\"Horse Tamers\\" (Chevaux de Marly) commissioned from his father in 1739 for Marly, when the elder Coustou was too infirm to actively carry out the commissions. They were completed and installed in 1745.Fran√ßois Souchal, Les fr√®res Coustou (Paris) 1980. He was accepted at the Acad√©mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture (1742) and pursued a successful official career, working fluently in styles that ranged from the Late Baroque of his morceau de r√©ception, a Seated Vulcan (illustrated) to the sentimental early neoclassicism of the Ganymede, whose affinities with Roman sculptures of Antinous have been suggested by Michael Worley.Michael Preston Worley, \\"The Image of Ganymede in France, 1730-1820: The Survival of a Homoerotic Myth\\" The Art Bulletin 76.4 (December 1994, pp. 630-643) p. 637. The sculpture was in the Hertford and Wallace collections before it was purchased for the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1964. He produced portrait busts as well as his religious and mythological subjects. His most prominent and ambitious official commission was the Monument to the Dauphin for the cathedral of Sens.

It was invented in 1934 by Swiss engineers Georges Braunschweig and Fritz Marti, at Universal Escapements, Ltd, of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. It is manufactured by Incabloc, S.A.Incabloc, S.A. website Similar systems are ETA's Etachoc, Kif, Seiko's Diashock, and Citizen's Parashock. The pivots and jewel bearings that support a watch balance wheel are fragile in comparison to the mass they must support, and without shock protection are the part of the watch most likely to be damaged under impact. Before the widespread use of shock protection devices like Incabloc, broken balance staffs were a common type of damage requiring watch repair. The Incabloc system uses a \\"lyre-shaped\\" spring to allow the delicate bearings to shift in their settings under impact, until a stronger shoulder of the staff contacts the strong metal endpiece, so that the pivots and bearings don't have to bear the force of the impact. When the impact is over, the springs guide the parts back to their original positions. The staff itself does not move relative to the jewel bearing, but the whole bearing is carried in a metal bushing that is free to move in the metal endpiece, under the control of the spring. Some modern balance wheels use a simpler arrangement, where, taking advantage of the low cost of modern synthetic rubies, a large jewel moves as its own mobile bushing.

The name comes from Ptolemy, who in his Geography, only mentioned the name and described the location of the settlement. There is some controversy over the identification of the Kelheim remains with Alcimoennis, but it is still widely accepted. GeographyLocation= The oppidum was located on the Michelsberg hill, dominating the peninsula at the confluence of the Danube and the Altm√ºhl rivers near Kelheim. History The peninsula has been inhabited more or less constantly since 13,000 BCE and the Celts built there as early as 500 BCE. Findings indicate the presence of an early La T√®ne period settlement near the Altm√ºhl delta. Numerous storage cellars have been found, interpreted to have been part of three farms with at least 15 buildings from the period of 450 to 380 BCE. For the middle La T√®ne period (380 to 150 BCE) few signs of local settlement have been discovered: a grave yielded four mid-La T√®ne fibulae and another a sword with scabbard from the third or second century BCE. The oppidum dates to the late La T√®ne period, however, and it is estimated that it was abandoned some time around the middle of the first century BCE. Who inhabited the oppidum is unclear. It could have been the central settlement of an unknown tribe, possibly a sub-tribe of the Vindelici centered in the nearby (and equally sizeable) Oppidum of Manching. =Economy= Economically, the Alcimoennis thrived on iron. The surrounding soil contains large concentrations of iron, and the thick forests on all sides delivered adequate fuel for the smelting process. The landscape to the west of the settlement literally, is covered in pock marks left by shallow mine shafts and pits. The valleys around the city contained vast fields for farming as well as livestock, most notably swine. Fishing probably played an important role in everyday life. There was not much room on the plateau for dwellings. Much of the area protected by the outer rampart was given over to prospecting and smelting activities, precluding its use as living areas. By contrast to Manching, only a fraction of the walled area likely was occupied by buildings. The oppidum's location at the two rivers and between Manching, Berching, and other settlements farther downstream on the Danube, together with the ample supply of wood and iron, likely were the basis for its existence. Some archaeologists think that the site is better thought of not as a city, but as a walled \\"industrial\\" complex, specializing in iron production. = Abandonment = The reasons for the abandonment of the city remain unknown. If the supposition that Alcimoennis belonged to the Vindelici is correct, then the city may have been abandoned after war with the Germanic Marcomanni tribe that moved in from the north. This nearly destroyed the Vindelici as a people and left their infrastructure in a shambles. In 15 BCE the Romans defeated and incorporated what remained of the Vindelici tribe and the area south of Arcimoenis became the province of Raetia. =Later use of the site= Mining continued on the plateau until the Middle Ages. Following victory over the French forces of Napoleon in the Befreiungskriege of the early nineteenth century, the Bavarian King Ludwig I had the monumental Befreiungshalle built directly over the remains of the settlement. During the same period, the construction of the King Ludwig Main- Danube canal (1836‚Äì45) through the Altm√ºhl river valley destroyed the surviving bits of the northern wall as well as any evidence of the waterfront activities the settlement had engaged in. Description Michelsberg fortifications= Remains of the outer rampart near Weltenburg Abbey Reconstruction of a pfostenschlitzmauer at Kelheim The exterior wall of the late-Celtic oppidum surrounded the whole Michelsberg and Hirschberg. Inside the area of roughly 600 ha the settlement from the second and first century BCE now referred to as Alcimoennis was located. It is the second largest such site in southern Germany after Heidengraben. The settlement included an artisan quarter at the Mitterfeld and a viereckschanze on an island in the Altm√ºhl. Otherwise, few housing units or graves have been discovered. The oppidum was secured by at least three sectional wall-and-moat defences. All the walls followed the same pfostenschlitzmauer design: tree trunks of roughly 60 cm diameter were pushed into the earth at least 1 m deep and roughly 2 m apart. On the outward-facing side, the space between the wooden beams was closed with limestone sheets from nearby quarries to a height of at least 5 to 6 m. The earthen ramparts which supported the back were around 10 to 11 m wide. An estimate puts the need for construction materials at more than 8,000 trees, 17,000 cubic m of limestone, and 35,000 cubic m of earth. It would have taken at 50 workers at least 70 years to build such a wall. The remains of four :de:Zangentore (gates) have been discovered as entries though the walls. The outer rampart crossed the peninsula, connecting the cliffs above the Danube near the later Weltenburg Abbey to the southern bank of the Altm√ºhl, a distance of 3.3 km. It likely was built in three separate stages and at some places reached a height of 6 m, averaging around 2 to 3 m. A moat was present only at some points, which has raised questions about its defensive character - it might simply have been holes dug to gain construction materials. The wall also was built in pfostenschlitz style, pierced in only three places by Zangentore. The connecting wall following the southern bank of the Altm√ºhl was added only in the last, the third, stage of construction. The inner rampart, also connected the cliffs overlooking the Danube to the Altm√ºhl. It is 930 m long and extant to a height of up to 4 m. On its outer side is a moat (2 m deep, 7 m wide) and a berm (5 m). Two Zangentore gave access to the Michelsberg. In construction the inner rampart resembled the outer one. It was completely rebuilt once. Along the southern bank of the Altm√ºhl a 3.3 km long wall was added during the latest period of construction. This was the structure that was destroyed by canal construction in the nineteenth century. Excavations uncovered evidence of one gate (added later), however, and this wall had been of the pfostenschlitz-type. The wall likely curved south at its eastern end, at what is today the Radlm√ºllergraben, west of the old town of Kelheim. =Prospecting pits= The area between outer and inner rampart is covered by prospecting pits and mine dumps, both Celtic and Medieval in origin. These occupy more than half of the plateau. Remains of ovens and charcoal indicate that smelting took place right there. Among slag heaps behind the inner rampart, excavations have found the remains of at least one La-T√®ne period and three Medieval smelters. =Dwellings= The remains of dwellings have been found in the Altm√ºhlaue and the Mitterfeld, both at the foot of the hill. Some of those showed signs of having been destroyed by fire. Evidence was found to identify one of the houses as the workshop of a bronze founder. Overall very little remains of the settlement; stone construction was foreign to the Celts and their thatched-roofed wooden structures mostly have disappeared over time. =Viereckschanze= A viereckschanze of roughly 100 by 100 m size was located in an elevated area in the Altm√ºhl delta. It was discovered in 1909. In 1978 or 1979, before its destruction by the canal, some excavations were conducted. By that time, the interior had already been completely destroyed by use as a gravel pit. The moat was up to 8 m wide and up to 3.2 m deep. To the east of the structure, a small burial site of 19 late La-T√®ne graves has been discovered. To the north of the viereckschanze remains of buildings have been found, but their use is unknown, they could have been used as dwellings or as warehouses. = Graveyards = Numerous Bronze- and Iron-age graveyards dot the woods around Alcimoennis, and likely hold deceased residents of the city. Despite their frequency, the graves are far too few to house the many inhabitants the city once had, which indicates that the city normally used alternative means of interment such as cremation for the majority of residents and reserved burial for important members of society. These graveyards have been the source of many discoveries, including many impeccably-preserved and elaborately-decorated urns and the Steer of Michelsberg, a bronze figurine in the shape of a steer from around 200 BCE. Most of the known graveyards consist of groups of grave mounds that still are quite visible today, notably around the nearby village of Altessing. Excavations Notable findings include a bronze wine jug (probably imported from Campania) discovered in 1863 in a grave near the centre of the oppidum. This also contained a spear head and a sword. Several other items were found in a grave in the so-called Mitterfeld at the foot of the Michelberg. Scientific excavations were conducted in 1959 and 1960, directed by K. Schwarz and between 1964 and 1972 by F.-R. Hermann. Further discoveries were made in the 1980s during the construction of the Rhine‚ÄìMain‚ÄìDanube Canal by B. Engelhardt, B.-R. Goetze and M. Hoppe. Identification of the site as Alcimoennis The geographer Ptolemy mentioned Alcimoennis in his Geography as a settlement in southern Germania north of the Danube.

A drum solo may be set or improvised, and of any length, up to being the main performance. In rock, drum solos are unique in that traditionally they are minimally or never accompanied, whereas other instruments may play solos accompanied or unaccompanied. They are also typically free-form in that they do not necessarily adhere to the tempo, style or structure of the song they accompany. In jazz, drum solos more typically adhere strictly to the tempo and form of the song, and may be accompanied sporadically by the other instruments; they may also \\"trade fours\\", or take alternating four-bar solos with the rest of the band. They may also trade eights, twelves (in the case of a blues), twos, single bars, or full choruses. A drum lift is a passage in which singing is backed only by the drums and no other music. It is not normally considered a solo, as the primary focus remains on the singing; however, it bears some similarity to a solo. A drum lift may be set or improvised, simple or elaborate, and may vary in length from part of a line to an entire verse. In marching band or drum corps, a drum section feature allows the remainder of the ensemble to create challenging formations without having to play their instruments at the same time, as depicted by the movie Drumline. In years past the drum solo was a standalone work. Beginning in the mid-to- late 1980s, however, drum solos, even extended ones, tended to be integrated into the overall flow of the music. This occurred earlier‚Äîsuch as in the 1976 Blue Devils show (in Channel One Suite, mimicking the drum break in the Buddy Rich original), but as time passed and show flow became more important, the stand-alone solo became less popular and is rarely heard in contemporary music. Drum solo competitions The largest drum solo competition in the world occurs each year at Guitar Center stores across the United States, however since 2017 has been on infinite hiatus. Each store winner advances to the quarter finals (District). The quarter final winner advances to the semi- finals (Regional). The five semi-final winners compete in the Grand Finals for a chance to win $25,000 cash in addition to other prizes. The Grand Finals winner also receives exposure in the media and at NAMM. Other drum solo competitions are hosted by either instrument manufacturers, as a component of drum seminars/conventions, or held by individual music stores throughout the world. For example, Roland Corporation, a manufacturer of electronic drums, hosts an annual competition for performing on its V-Drum kit.

She is one of the most renowned opera singers of the 20th century and was pre-eminent in the 1960s and 1970s. Career Janowitz was born in Berlin, but grew up in Graz, Austria, where she became a naturalised Austrian.\\"Gundula Janowitz 70\\" by Manuel Brug, Die Welt (2007-08-02) She studied at the Graz Conservatory in Austria, and had already begun to sing at the highest level by the end of the 1950s (Haydn's The Creation, with Herbert von Karajan in 1960). In 1959, Karajan engaged her as Barbarina in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro at the Vienna State Opera, of which she became a permanent member in 1962. During the 1960s and 1970s, Janowitz became one of the most popular singers in her field internationally and she developed a comprehensive discography of works ranging from Bach to Richard Strauss. Those eminent conductors with whom she performed included Karajan, but also Otto Klemperer, Eugen Jochum, Leonard Bernstein, Rafael Kubel√≠k, Karl B√∂hm, Georg Solti, and Carlos Kleiber. One of the emphases of Janowitz's work was the development of song recitals, which she gave several times at the Salzburg Festival. Following her vocal career, she was active as a vocal teacher. In 1990, she temporarily took over the position of Opera Director in Graz.Gundula Janowitz at bach-cantatas.com Janowitz appeared on many of the great stages of the world, including Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Bayreuth Festival, the Salzburg Easter Festival, the Metropolitan Opera, the Paris Opera, La Scala and the Royal Opera House. In 1980, she sang the part of the Countess in a now legendary new production of The Marriage of Figaro (with Georg Solti as conductor, Giorgio Strehler as director and Ezio Frigerio as set designer). Her recording of Schubert's Lieder for female voice has been twice awarded Germany's Deutscher Schallplattenpreis. Janowitz's farewell to the operatic stage was on 18 May 1990, at the Vienna State Opera in the title role of Ariadne auf Naxos (with Heinrich Hollreiser as conductor, and as director and designer). She kept singing Lieder recitals until 1997, when she completely retired from performing. As well as being an honorary member of the Vienna State Opera and of the Academy of Music in Graz, she was appointed an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in London in 2000. Voice and repertory Janowitz's voice is recognizable by its pure, by James Jolly, Gramophone (2006-04-01) \\"crystal clear‚Äù,Daily Mail, July 1964, quoted here: http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/r/Glyndebourne/GFOCD00664 \\"creamy\\" tone, and rapid vibrato. Like her predecessor Maria Stader, who had similar timbre to hers, and like her contemporary, Elizabeth Harwood, Janowitz mastered first and foremost the high and middle register and lyrical-emotional expression. Despite her comparatively weak sound projection, she occasionally performed in dramatic roles (Sieglinde, Leonore, Elsa) or comic roles (Marzelline, Rosalinde), but she was most highly regarded as Fiordiligi, Countess Rosina Almaviva, Pamina, Agathe, Arabella, Ariadne, the Angel Gabriel (The Creation), Countess Madeleine, and in sacred music. Of her interpretation of Four Last Songs by Richard Strauss, David Bowie wrote: \\"Although Eleanor Steber and Lisa Della Casa do fine interpretations of this monumental work, Janowitz‚Äôs performance [...] has been described, rightly, as transcendental. It aches with love for a life that is quietly fading. I know of no other piece of music, nor any performance, which moves me quite like this.\\"Bowie, D., \\"Confessions of a Vinyl Junkie\\", Vanity Fair, Nov., 2003. With a few exceptions, she avoided foreign-language roles (although recordings exist of her singing Don Carlos and Verdi's Requiem and all three Mozart/DaPonte operas in Italian). An excerpt of her portrayal of the Figaro Countess in the duettino \\"Canzonetta sull'aria\\" with Swiss soprano Edith Mathis features prominently in 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption.

He was married to Karen Blixen (n√©e Dinesen) from 1914 to 1925.  Personal life  Blixen's coat of arms Bror Fredrik \\"Blix\\" von Blixen-Finecke and his twin brother, Hans Gustaf, were the youngest of seven children born to Baron Fredrik von Blixen-Finecke (1847‚Äì1919) and his wife, Countess Clara Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs (1855‚Äì1925). His paternal grandfather was Baron Carl Frederik Axel Bror von Blixen-Finecke (1822‚Äì1873), who held the family seat at N√§sbyholm Castle and served Denmark as its Minister of Foreign Affairs 1859‚Äì1860, while his grandmother was the Baron's first wife, Gustava Charlotta Ankarcrona (1821‚Äì1890), a descendant of John III of Sweden. Bror's maternal grandfather was Count Christian Emil Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs, Denmark's prime minister 1865‚Äì1870 and a descendant of Frederick III of Denmark. Blixen- Finecke attended agricultural college at Alnarp, and then managed the Stjetneholm farm, within the Nasbyholm estate. Blix and Hans had known \\"Tanne\\", Karen Dinesen, since childhood, since Blix's mother and Tanne's father were cousins. Hans had actually turned down Tanne, before she became attached to Blix. A visit from Blix's maternal uncle, Count Mogens Frijs, and his tales of life in Naivasha, inspired Blix to seek his future in Africa. Bror Fredrik von Blixen-Finecke became engaged to Karen Dinesen, who followed him to Kenya in 1913, where they were married on 14 January 1914 in Mombasa. They then ran a coffee plantation at the foot of Ngong Hills, bought by Blixen from Ake Sjogren, using funds provided on behalf of her family. They lived in the manager's house, located on the Mbagathi River, until 1917, when they moved into the main two-story stone farm house. During WWI, Blix served in Lord Delamere's patrols along the border with German-Tanganyika, and Tanne helped transport supplies. According to Peter Capstick, \\"It was not long after Blixen and his wife settled on their farm that he started womanizing.\\" Karen became infected with syphilis as a consequence. Capstick goes on to say, \\"His forays into town and his often wild socializing at the Muthaiga Club, coupled with a legendary indiscipline when it came to money and honoring his debts, soon gave the charming Swede a notorious reputation.\\" The farm did not prosper, the couple separated, and eventually divorced. Yet, thirty years after their first safari, Karen was quoted as saying, \\"If I should wish anything back of my life, it would be to go on safari once again with Bror Blixen.\\" Aage Westenholz, Tanne's maternal uncle and family trustee after her father died, turned the farm into a company in 1918 with Aage as the chairman. Blaming the farm's losses on Blix, Aage banned Blix from the farm in the spring of 1920, and by 1921 Tanne and Blixen were separated.In Blixen's words, \\"Difficulty upon difficulty arose. The plantation had to be sold-my home was broken up. I stood there in the forest empty-handed. But I still had my sporting rifle.\\" Blixen then took up professional hunting from 1922 to 1928, with time out in 1927 to accompany Charles Markham in crossing Africa east to west, first in The Vagrant from Stanleyville to Kano, then via International Harvester truck to Paris across Sahara Desert. On 1 August 1928, he married the British aristocrat Jacqueline Harriet \\"Cockie\\" Alexander.The Peerage: Jacqueline Harriet Alexander Linked 2014-04-06 They managed Singu, a property at Babati, owned by Blixen's first hunting client Dick Cooper. In 1929, Blixen concentrated on his safari business and became Cooper's East Africa agent. The safari work enabled the Blixens to purchase their own farm at Ndasagu. When he was visited in Kenya by the Swedish adventurer and aviator Eva Dickson in 1932, while \\"Cockie\\" was visiting her mother in England, the marriage quickly ended, as he and Eva became lovers.Popul√§r Historia, 23 januari, 2009: √Ñventyraren Eva Dickson (in Swedish) Linked 2014-04-06 In 1935, he and \\"Cockie\\" divorced, and the following year he married Eva in New York, and they spent their honeymoon together with Ernest Hemingway and his wife Martha Gellhorn sailing around Cuba and the Bahamas. Cockie was quoted by Ulf Aschan as saying, \\"I have never regretted anything-except leaving Blix. He was the love of my life.\\" In March 1938, Eva Dickson von Blixen-Finecke died in a car crash outside Baghdad, on her way back from Calcutta after having been forced to give up her big dream of driving the Silk Road to Beijing. Bror von Blixen- Finecke didn't learn about her death until 28 July 1938, and he was devastated by the news. Blix left Africa for good in 1938, eventually returning to his native Sweden. He died in a 1946 car accident, in which he was a passenger. Von Blixen-Finecke's identical twin, Hans, had died in a plane crash in 1917.  Big-game hunter in Africa  Blixen formed Tanganyika Guides Ltd, for professional hunting, in partnership with Philip Percival and Jeff Manley. Blixen and Percival became East Africa's leading hunters. According to Ulf Aschan, \\"Safaris lasted from one month to three. A meticulous organizer, Blix never left anything to chance. Fly camps, fuel depots, airstrips, provisions, and staff were always laid out well in advance. He would also take time to reconnoiter an area thoroughly beforehand to check on waterholes and general game movements.\\" On 16 Nov. 1928, according to Bror, he was approached by the Prince of Wales in his quest to \\"bag a lion\\". Bror and his \\"old friend\\" Denys Finch Hatton proceeded to help the prince do so followed by a hunt for buffalo. They had a repetition expedition with the prince, but for elephant, in Feb. 1930. Other famous personages Blixen guided on a hunt were Ernst Udet, Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr., George Washington Vanderbilt III, Ernest Hemingway, Freddie Guest, Winston Frederick Churchill Guest, and Lord Marmaduke Furness. According to Beryl Markham in her memoir West with the Night, \\"He is six feet of amiable Swede and, to my knowledge, the toughest, most durable White Hunter ever to snicker at the fanfare of safari or to shoot a charging buffalo between the eyes while debating whether his sundown drink would be gin or whiskey.\\" \\"Hunting with Blix was a magnificent experience,\\" said Ebba Hamilton, \\"With his quiet, almost lyrical narrative of what happened around us, he got nature to live like I have never experienced since. Rose Cartwright stated that Blix was, \\"An excellent shot, a meticulous organizer, and very good teacher. He was on a par with the best African trackers, and they admired him greatly for his skills and stamina.\\"  Writing  Bror von Blixen-Finecke was a talented writer; his best-known book was his autobiography, African Hunter (1938), long regarded as fine Africana since its translation from Swedish in 1938 by F. H. Lyon.'African Hunter' Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke Tr. by FH Lyon. Editor's Note to the Reprint Version, (1986) by Peter Hathaway Capstick. The Peter Capstick Library, St. Martin's Press, NY In 1988 St. Martin's Press published a collection of von Blixen-Finecke's letters to family and friends in a book titled Bror Blixen: The Africa Letters. In popular culture In the film Out of Africa (1985), which is based on Karen Blixen's memoirs of the same name, the role of Bror von Blixen- Finecke is played by Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer, who also plays his brother Hans.

It was founded in August 1980PSC homepage retrieved 11 June 2010 by Robin Blick, Karen Blick, and Adam Westoby, and continued its activities into the first half of the 1990s. The campaign was not named after Polish Solidarity (of whose name the founders became aware only later on); rather, it was inspired by the Chile Solidarity Campaign and the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign. A splinter-group, Solidarity With Solidarity (SWS), was formed in December 1981. Most of the PSC's early members were ex-Communists and other socialists, and the original aim was to support the strikes called by Solidarity in Poland. Some Labour Party members and leftwing Polish exiles, including members of the Polish Socialist Party In Exile, joined the group. Within the first year, centrist and right-leaning exiles and other right- leaning individuals also become members of the PSC. Some trade unions became affiliated as well. In 1982, the group managed to resist a takeover attempt by the Trotskyist International Marxist Group (IMG). The campaign met with opposition from the Communist Party and some within the Labour Party. The PSC called for British trade unions to cut their links with state-run trade unions in Eastern bloc countries, a demand which was oddly resisted by the IMG. It also called on the Labour Party to discontinue its policy of inviting Eastern bloc Communist Party members as delegates to the annual Labour Party Conference. (At a 1981 meeting of the Labour National Executive Committee, only three people supported changing this policy. In 1982, following the imposition of Martial Law, a narrow majority on the Executive voted to discontinue the invitations. The policy was later changed back again to some extent.) After the PSC picketed a TUC meeting in February 1981, the TUC International Committee agreed to send assistance to Solidarno≈õƒá. Afterwards, the PSC and the Committee enjoyed good relations, and Solidarno≈õƒá delegates began to get invited to TUC conferences. In April 1981, a march in support of Solidarno≈õƒá was organized by the Hands Off Polish Workers campaign, a group linked to the Labour leadership of the Greater London Council. The PSC participated, but was uneasy about the ban on \\"Cold War slogans\\". Giles Hart, official historian of the PSC, argued: \\"If this meant anything, it seemed to mean that one could say 'hands off Polish workers' but one could not say anything about whose hands were threatening Polish workers.\\" Nevertheless, a Communist counterdemonstration also took place.

Having obtained an honours degree in colour chemistry from the University of Leeds in 1967 he spent a year working as a volunteer with Voluntary Service Overseas in Dacca, Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan) before returning to Leeds to study for a Ph.D. in colour chemistry. Following his graduation in 1971, Mottram took up a post at the Meat Research Institute at Langford, near Bristol, UK. Mottram moved to the University of Reading in 1988. His research interests are mainly in the area of flavour chemistry, the analysis of flavour and the factors affecting its formation and retention in foods, especially meat. Following the detection of the potential carcinogen acrylamide in a range of fried and oven-cooked foods, Mottram, in collaboration with Professor Bronek Wedzicha of the University of Leeds, provided an important breakthrough in understanding the origin of acrylamide in cooked foods which was published in Nature. Recently, Mottram has collaborated with chef Heston Blumenthal of The Fat Duck restaurant in the village of Bray in Berkshire. Mottram is married to Angela (n√©e Cormacey) and they have two children, Hazel and Robert.

Northeast Glacier is a steep, heavily crevassed glacier on the west side of Hemimont Plateau, long and wide at its mouth, which flows from McLeod Hill westward and then south- westwards into Marguerite Bay between the Debenham Islands and Roman Four Promontory, on the west coast of Graham Land, Antarctica. Northeast Glacier was first surveyed in 1936 by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) under John Riddoch Rymill. It was resurveyed in 1940 by members of the United States Antarctic Service (USAS), who first used the glacier as a sledging route, and so named by them because it lay on the north-eastern side of their base at Stonington Island.  Yapey√∫ Refuge  Yapey√∫ Refuge () is an Argentine Antarctic refuge nearby San Mart√≠n Base from which it depends. It is located on the Falli√®res Coast in the Antarctic Peninsula. The refuge was inaugurated on November 4, 1956 as logistical support and is administered by the Argentine Army. The shelter is located at 600 meters above the Northeast Glacier. In 1956, during the installation of the San Mart√≠n Base, the Argentine Army built three refuges in order to have logistical support from Marguerite Bay, in the Bellingshausen Sea, to the Weddell Sea crossing the Antarctic Peninsula from west to east. The three refuges were built: the Chacabuco, the Yapey√∫ and the Maip√∫. The project took 63 days, travelling about 786 kilometres using sled pulled by dogs. The refuge has food, equipment, medicines and fuel and was used for scientific projects carried out in the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year. The refuge pay homage to Yapey√∫, the birthplace of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n.

The C√¥te de Beaune starts between Nuits-Saint-Georges and Beaune, and extends southwards for about 25 km to the River Dheune. The trend of producing red wines continues from the C√¥te de Nuits to the north, down through Beaune, although the wines become lighter and more perfumed. Farther south lie the great names of white Burgundy such as Meursault and Chassagne-Montrachet. The far south of the district sees a return to red wines in Santenay that continues across the Dheune into the C√¥te Chalonnaise. This mix of Pinot noir and Chardonnay grapes reflects geology in the southern C√¥te d'Or that is more variable than in the north. Appellations Wine label from Savigny The Burgundy wine article explains the local classifications in more detail. Above the basic AOC Bourgogne lies C√¥te de Beaune Villages, a general appellation for wines from one or more of 16 villages in the district excluding Aloxe-Corton, Pommard, Volnay and Beaune. Four vineyards on a hill above Beaune get the confusing designation of C√¥te de Beaune. The Hautes-C√¥tes de Beaune are a separate appellation for the hills to the west of Beaune. Individual 'village' appellations are the next step up, followed by the Premiers Crus, which roughly correspond to individual vineyards that aren't good enough for Grand Cru status. \\"Premier Cru\\" on its own refers to a blend from several premier cru vineyards, wine made from just one location will say \\"Premier Cru\\" followed by the name of the vineyard. The \\"Cortons\\" in Aloxe- Corton are the only Grand Cru red wines in the district. The same commume has one of the great white wines in the Grand Cru of Corton-Charlemagne (which extends into Pernand and Ladoix), whilst the Montrachet family of Grand Crus are farther south, split between Puligny-Montrachet and Chassagne-Montrachet. From north to south the communes of the C√¥te de Beaune are as follows : Northern communesPernand-Vergelesses= In the northwest corner of the C√¥te de Beaune, Pernand-Vergelesses produces about 30,000 cases, 75% red. The commune contains 34.3ha of the Grand Cru Corton-Charlemagne (see Aloxe-Corton below), and five Premier Crus (57ha), of which Ile de Vergelesses is the most notable. There are 228.3 ha of vineyards in total. =Ladoix-Serrigny= Down on the plain, Ladoix is the most northernly of the villages of the C√¥te de Beaune on the N74 Route des Grand Crus. It has 160.1ha of vineyards, including another piece of Corton-Charlemagne. =Aloxe-Corton= Like Vougeot with the Clos de Vougeot, the appellation of Aloxe (pronounced 'Alosse') is dominated by a single vineyard. The east side of the hill of Corton, about 100 hectares, is devoted to red wines. Each of the 22 plots here is allowed to append its name to that of the vineyard, so you see Corton Le Corton, Corton Clos du Roi, Corton-Bressandes, Corton-Renardes and so on. At their best the red wines of Corton combine the muscularity of the C√¥te de Nuits with the elegance of the C√¥te de Beaune. On the southwest side of the hill is a piece of land given by Charlemagne to the Abbey of Saulieu in 775. According to legend his wife had insisted white grapes be planted on the site, to avoid his beard being stained by red wine. If so she had a sharp eye for a vineyard, as the 72ha of Corton- Charlemagne produces some of the great white Burgundies. The appellation of Aloxe-Corton covers 297.1 ha. of which 169.6 ha is Grand Cru and 37.5 ha is Premier Cru.Ch√¢teau of Savigny-l√®s-Beaune =Savigny-l√®s-Beaune= Savigny is the third biggest appellation by production in the C√¥te de Beaune, with around 100,000 cases of mostly red wine. The 22 Premier Crus come in two styles, more delicate on the south facing clay soils to the north, rounder and more forward on the east facing gravel to the south. The vineyards cover 544 ha of which 141.5 ha is Premier Cru. =Chorey-l√®s-Beaune= Another satellite of Beaune producing mostly red wine in a similar style to Beaune and Savigny but even lighter. The appellation was only awarded in 1970. There are no Premier Crus in its 168ha, of which 9.3ha is Chardonnay. =Beaune= The famous roof of the Hospices de Beaune The commercial centre of the C√¥te d'Or is also the biggest appellation by production, with 170,000 cases. Most of the big negociants have substantial holdings in the region. The 28 Premier Crus occupy 322ha of the 450ha. The northern wines are firmer and longer lasting, the southern wines softer and more forward. As mentioned above, a local hill gets its own appellation of \\"C√¥te de Beaune\\". The Hospices de Beaune are a charity based in the town, consisting of the H√¥tel-Dieu hospital and the Hospices de la Charit√©. The Hospices are funded by their endowment of 55ha of vineyards on the C√¥te d'Or, and the auction of their wines on the third Sunday in November sets a benchmark for prices for that vintage. =Pommard= Pommard (pronounced Poe-Marr) makes some of the most tannic and full-bodied wines from the Cote d'Or department. Like Nuits-St-George, the name of Pommard was made famous as a marketplace for wines from better areas, in the days before Appellation Controlee. The fact that its name is easy for foreigners to pronounce also helped. 130,000 cases from 337ha makes Pommard the second biggest area by production after Beaune. 135ha of that is Premier Cru, of which Les Epenots and Les Rugiens are the most notable. =Volnay= In general the wines from Volnay are lighter, more elegant and graceful than most other red Burgundies from the Cote d'Or. 80,000 cases of red wine come from its 242ha of vineyards, of which 115ha is split among 26 Premier Crus. The most notable of these are Bousse d'Or, Champans, Clos des Chenese, Clos des Ducs, Les Caillerets, Santenots and Taille Pied. Red wine from the Santenots vineyard is classified as Volnay Santenots, whereas white wine from the same vineyard can call itself Meursault Premier Cru or Meursault Santenots. =Month√©lie= Harvest time on the C√¥te de Beaune Southwest of Volnay lies the historic hamlet of Month√©lie. It's a little off the beaten track both literally and in the world of wine, but Volnay's little brother can supply Volnay-style red wines at less-than-Volnay prices. 31ha of the 140ha is Premier Cru. =Saint Romain= The former name of \\"Belles Roches\\" hints at the spectacular location of Saint Romain, nestling under a cliff at the top of the Clous valley above Meursault. The appellation was only designated in 1947, and there are no Premier Crus in its 135 ha. The mostly red wines represent the more rustic side of Burgundy and take a little while to come round. =Auxey-Duresses= Formerly owned by the abbey at Cluny, Auxey was once the site of many watermills powered by the river Clous. It is another of those appellations that is less well known, as its wines used to be sold as Volnay or Pommard. It has 32ha of Premier Crus within its 170ha, and the significant plantings of Chardonnay tells us that we are about to enter white wine territory. Southern communesMeursault= Perhaps surprisingly, one of the most famous names in Burgundy has no Grand Crus, although there have been calls for Les Perrieres to be so designated ever since it was described as \\"t√™te de cuv√©e\\" in the 1855 list. Meursault grows Chardonnay almost exclusively (note the exception of Santenots mentioned in the Volnay section), which makes wonderfully rich and buttery white Burgundy, developing a certain nuttiness with time. The Premier Crus occupy 132ha of the 437ha. =Blagny= Blagny is a former Gallo-Roman village down on the plain, whose white wines are sold as Meursault or Puligny-Montrachet. The Blagny appellation was created in 1970 for the red wines of the neighbourhood. They don't have the fineness of the wines from up on the ridge, but Blagny is a source of cheaper red Burgundy in a light, rustic style. =Puligny-Montrachet= Puligny- Montrachet village wine The \\"Scabby Hill\\" (\\"Mont Rachaz\\"), not much more than an undulation between Puligny and Chassagne, is one of the most famous vineyard sites in the world. Wines from the Chassagne side are called \\"Le Montrachet\\" and from the Puligny side simply \\"Montrachet\\" - there are 4 hectares of each. Above Montrachet proper is the 7.59ha of Chevalier Montrachet (all in Puligny), at the bottom of the slope lies B√¢tard Montrachet (6.02ha in Puligny). The names of these two Grand Crus supposedly reflect the division of the estate of the Seigneur de Montrachet between his two sons, one of whom had been a knight in the Crusades, the other was illegitimate. Puligny also contains the Grand Cru of Bienvenues-B√¢tard-Montrachet (3.69ha). Detailed account of the organisation of Puligny ISSN 1744-1307 There are also 100ha of Premier Cru vineyards out of the total of 235ha in Puligny. Technically there are 24 Premier Crus, although 10 of them represent particular plots within other Premier Crus. While the complex, minerally white wines get all the attention, there are 6.4ha of Pinot noir. =Chassagne-Montrachet= As well as 4ha of Le Montrachet (sic) and 5.85ha of B√¢tard Montrachet, Chassagne contains all 1.57ha of the Grand Cru Criots-B√¢tard-Montrachet. There are 159 hectares of Premier Cru in the 350.4ha of Chassagne, which contains a surprising amount of Pinot noir. Less red wine is now being produced, as it sells for lower prices than the whites although much of the Pinot land is less suited to Chardonnay production. The white wine tends to be richer than that of Puligny but not as elegant; the reds are quite robust and need time to come round. =Saint Aubin= Out towards the Hautes-C√¥tes de Beaune west of Montrachet, the vineyards of St Aubin were once planted with Gamay but now produce a mixture of Chardonnay and Pinot noir. Traditionally the village has been overshadowed by the famous names to the east, although the reputation of its white wines is developing as the prices of their neighbours head into the stratosphere. The red wines have leathery notes in their youth, that soften attractively with age. 156ha of the 237ha are Premier Crus. =Santenay= The southern tail of the C√¥te de Beaune sees Pinot noir predominate, with 90% of wine from Santenay being red. The wines are solid, tending more towards the rustic than the elegant, but are cheaper than the big names to the north. Santenay has 124ha of Premier Crus in its 379ha. Greyish limestone makes up the high ground up to a height of 500 meters. Lower down the slope, starting at the 300 meter line, is oolitic limestone, white oolite, marls, kidney- shaped limestone, and lower oolite on a layer of marl. =Les Maranges= Les Maranges was created in 1989 as a merger of three appellations west of Santenay: Cheilly-l√®s-Maranges, Dezizes-l√®s-Maranges, and Sampigny-l√®s- Maranges. Being in Sa√¥ne et Loire some people consider these villages to be not part of the C√¥te d'Or proper, although the geology is similar and the wines are decent. 100ha of the 240ha is Premier Cru.

These finishes are coarse in nature and usually are a preliminary finish applied before manufacturing. An example would be grinding gates off of castings, deburring or removing excess weld material. It is coarse in appearance and applied by using 36‚Äì100 grit abrasive.. When the finish is specified as #3, the material is polished to a uniform 60‚Äì80 grit. ; #4 Architectural finish Also known as brushed, directional or satin finish. A #4 architectural finish is characterized by fine polishing grit lines that are uniform and directional in appearance. It is produced by polishing the metal with a 120‚Äì180 grit belt or wheel finish and then softened with an 80‚Äì120 grit greaseless compound or a medium non woven abrasive belt or pad. ; #4 Dairy or sanitary finish This finish is commonly used for the medical and food industry and almost exclusively used on stainless steel. This finish is much finer than a #4 architectural finish. This finish enhances the physical appearance of the metal as well as increases the sanitary benefits.http://www.ofrmetals.com/services/polishing One takes great care to remove any surface defects in the metal, like pits, that could allow bacteria to grow. A #4 dairy or sanitary finish is produced by polishing with a 180‚Äì240 grit belt or wheel finish softened with 120‚Äì240 grit greaseless compound or a fine non woven abrasive belt or pad. ; #6 Finish Also known as a fine satin finish. This finish is produced by polishing with a 220‚Äì280 grit belt or wheel softened with a 220‚Äì230 greaseless compound or very fine non woven abrasive belt or pad. Polishing lines will be soft and less reflective than a #4 architectural finish. ; #7 Finish A #7 finish is produced by polishing with a 280‚Äì320 belt or wheel and sisal buffing with a cut and color compound. This is a semi-bright finish that will still have some polishing lines but they will be very dull. Carbon steel and iron are commonly polished to a #7 finish before chrome plating. A #7 finish can be made bright by color buffing with coloring compound and a cotton buff. This is commonly applied to keep polishing costs down when a part needs to be shiny but not flawless. ; #8 Finish Also known as a mirror finish. This finish is produced by polishing with at least a 320 grit belt or wheel finish. Care will be taken in making sure all surface defects are removed. The part is sisal buffed and then color buffed to achieve a mirror finish. The quality of this finish is dependent on the quality of the metal being polished. Some alloys of steel and aluminum cannot be brought to a mirror finish. Castings that have slag or pits will also be difficult, if not impossible, to polish to a #8.

Corona treatment (sometimes referred to as air plasma) is a surface modification technique that uses a low temperature corona discharge plasma to impart changes in the properties of a surface. The corona plasma is generated by the application of high voltage to an electrode that has a sharp tip. The plasma forms at the tip. A linear array of electrodes is often used to create a curtain of corona plasma. Materials such as plastics, cloth, or paper may be passed through the corona plasma curtain in order to change the surface energy of the material. All materials have an inherent surface energy. Surface treatment systems are available for virtually any surface format including dimensional objects, sheets and roll goods that are handled in a web format. Corona treatment is a widely used surface treatment method in the plastic film, extrusion, and converting industries. History The corona treatment was invented by the Danish engineer Verner Eisby in 1951. Verner had been asked by one of his customers if he could find a solution which would make it possible to print on plastic. Verner found that there were already a couple of ways to accomplish this. One was a gas flame method and the other was a spark generating method, both of which were crude and uncontrollable and did not produce a homogeneous product. Verner came up with the theory that a high frequency corona discharge would provide both a more efficient and controllable method to treat the surface. Exhaustive experiments proved him to be correct. Verner's company, Vetaphone, obtained patent rights for the new corona treatment system. Materials Many plastics, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, have chemically inert and nonporous surfaces with low surface tensions causing them to be non-receptive to bonding with printing inks, coatings, and adhesives. Although results are invisible to the naked eye, surface treating modifies surfaces to improve adhesion. Polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, vinyl, PVC, PET, metalized surfaces, foils, paper, and paperboard stocks are commonly treated by this method. It is safe, economical, and delivers high line speed throughput. Corona treatment is also suitable for the treatment of injection and blow molded parts, and is capable of treating multiple surfaces and difficult parts with a single pass. Equipment Corona discharge equipment consists of a high-frequency power generator, a high-voltage transformer, a stationary electrode, and a treater ground roll. Standard utility electrical power is converted into higher frequency power which is then supplied to the treater station. The treater station applies this power through ceramic or metal electrodes over an air gap onto the material's surface. Two basic corona treater stations are used in extrusion coating applications‚ÄîBare Roll and Covered Roll. On a bare roll treater station, the dielectric encapsulates the electrode. On a covered roll station, it encapsulates the treater base roll. The treater consists of an electrode and a base roll in both stations. In theory a covered roll treater is generally used to treat non-conductive webs, and a Bare Roll treater is used to treat conductive webs. However, manufacturers who treat a variety of substrates on the same production line may choose to use a Bare Roll treater. Pre-treatment Many substrates provide a better bonding surface when they are treated at the time they are produced. This is called ‚Äúpre-treatment.‚Äù The effects of corona treatment diminish over time. Therefore, many surfaces will require a second ‚Äúbump‚Äù treatment at the time they are converted to ensure bonding with printing inks, coatings, and adhesives. Other technologies Other technologies used for surface treatment include in-line atmospheric (air) plasma, flame plasma, and chemical plasma systems. =Atmospheric plasma treatment= Atmospheric-pressure plasma treatment is very similar to corona treatment but there are a few differences between them. Both treatments may use one or more high voltage electrodes which charge the surrounding blown gas molecules and ionizes them. However, in atmospheric plasma systems, the overall plasma density is much greater which enhances the rate and degree to which the ionized molecules are incorporated onto a materials' surface. An increased rate of ion bombardment occurs which may result in stronger material bonding traits depending on the gas molecules used in the process. Atmospheric plasma treatment technology also eliminates a possibility of treatment on a material's non-treated side; also known as backside treatment. =Flame plasma= Flame plasma treaters generate more heat than other treating processes, but materials treated through this method tend to have a longer shelf-life. These plasma systems are different from air plasma systems because flame plasma occurs when flammable gas and surrounding air are combusted into an intense blue flame. Objects‚Äô surfaces are polarized from the flame plasma affecting the distribution of the surface's electrons in an oxidation form. This treatment requires higher temperatures so many of the materials that are treated with a flame plasma can be damaged. =Chemical plasma= Chemical plasma is based on the combination of air plasma and flame plasma. Much like air plasma, chemical plasma fields are generated from electrically charged air. But, instead of air, chemical plasma relies on a mixture of other gases depositing various chemical groups onto the treated surface.

In flight it has a slow and rather ponderous look and, unlike some other herons, its legs are not held horizontally. Male and female look similar, with an overall covering of slate gray and chestnut feathers. The head and its bushy crest, face, back and sides of the neck are chestnut. The chin, throat, foreneck and upper breast are white, with black streaks across the foreneck and upper breast. The lower breast and belly are buff with black streaks. The back and upper wings are slate-grey, with a chestnut shoulder patch at the bend of the wings when they're closed. The under-wing is pale chestnut. The upper mandible is black and the lores and orbital areas are yellow with a greenish tinge. The eyes are yellow while legs and feet are black. Juveniles look similar to the adults, but are paler. The only heron with somewhat similarly-colorful plumage characteristics, the widespread purple heron, is much smaller than the Goliath. Despite the shared plumage characteristics with the purple species, the closest extant relatives of the Goliath are considered to be the great-billed and the white-bellied herons of Southern Asia. Due to their large size, this species trio is sometimes referred to as the \\"giant herons\\". The Goliath heron has a distinct deep bark, often described as kowoork, audible from a distances of up to 2 km. A disturbance call (arrk), sharper and higher, can also occasionally be heard. A huh-huh is given during the crouched stage, while a krooo may be heard with the neck extended. Organ- like duetting has been reported at nest sites but has not been confirmed. Habitat The Goliath heron is very aquatic, even by heron standards, rarely venturing far from a water source and preferring to fly along waterways rather than move over land. Important habitats can include lakes, swamps, mangrove wetlands, reefs with few cool water, sometimes river deltas. It typically is found in shallows, though can be observed near deep water over dense water vegetation. Goliath herons can even be found in small watering holes. They have ranged in elevation from sea level to . They tend to prefer pristine wetlands and generally avoid areas where human disturbances are a regular occurrence. Diet and behaviour At iSimangaliso Wetland Park, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa Goliath herons are solitary foragers and are highly territorial towards other Goliaths entering their feeding territories.(Whitfield and Blaber 1978, Mock and Mock 1980) On occasions, two may be seen together but these are most likely to be a breeding pair or immatures. A diurnal and often rather inactive feeder, this heron often hunts by standing in the shallows, intently watching the water at its feet. This is a typical feeding method among large Ardea herons and it can forage in deeper waters than most due to its larger size. It may also perch on heavy floating vegetation, in order to prevent water from rippling around them.University of Michigan- Ardea goliath: INFORMATION. Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu. Retrieved on 2012-08-23. As prey appears, the heron rapidly spears it with open mandibles, often spearing both mandibles through the fish's body, and then swallows it whole. It is possible that the bill is used in a lure-like fashion occasionally, attracting fish to the immobile, large object submerged in the water. The handling period is long, with herons often placing their struggling prey on floating vegetation while preparing to swallow it. Due to its generally slow movements and handling time, the Goliath is frequently vulnerable to kleptoparasitism. In Africa, African fish eagles frequently pirate food caught by Goliaths, although other large birds such as saddle- billed storks and pelicans may also steal their prey. Prey almost entirely consists of fish. The Goliath heron specializes in relatively large fish, with an average prey weight range in Natal of and length of . Exceptionally, the largest fish targeted may measure although the heron may not be able to swallow prey up to this size. Small fish are generally ignored and the average Goliath catches around 2 or 3 fish a day. Breams, mullet, tilapia and carp have locally been recorded as preferred species. Any other small animals that they come across may be eaten, including frogs, prawns, small mammals, lizards, snakes, insects and even carrion. Breeding Adult transporting nesting material Juveniles in the Kruger National Park Its breeding season coincides generally with the start of the rainy season, which is around November to March. In some areas, breeding is year around, with no discernable peak season. Breeding may not occur every year. Fairly adaptable in their nesting site selection, Goliath herons generally prefer to nest on islands or islands of vegetation. The birds may abandon a nesting site if the island becomes attached to the mainland. Lakes or other large bodies of water usually hold colonies. They nest fairly low in variously sedge, reeds, bushes, trees or even on rocks or large tree stumps. The nesting dispersal seems highly variable as everything from a solitary pair (with no other Goliath nests anywhere near) to fairly large colonies have been observed, with no seeming local geographical preferences. Occasionally, they may join mixed-species colonies including other heron species, cormorants, darters, ibises and gulls. The breeding displays are not well known and may be subdued, due in part to breeding pairs possibly reunited year after year. The nests are large but often flimsy (depending on available vegetation around the nesting site), often measuring around in diameter. Eggs are pale blue, averaging and weighing around . The clutch size can range from 2 to 5 (usually 3 or 4). Incubation lasts 24 to 30 days. Although they can sometimes replace clutches, often only around 25% of eggs succeed in hatching due to various environmental conditions or predation. The young are fed by regurgitation in the nest and, after a few weeks, can bill jab and practice defensive postures against each other. At around five weeks they leave the nest completely. The parents continue to tend to them for variously 40 to 80 days. Around 62% of fledglings who successfully leave the nest survive to adulthood. Locally, the white-tailed eagle and the African fish eagle may be a predator at colonies. Due its size and formidable bill, the full-grown Goliath heron may not have any regular avian predators. Despite their ponderous movements, Goliath herons can think quickly and often take flight before mammalian carnivores (such as hyenas or jackals) can predate them.

After settling in the United States in 1906, he lived in Chicago and then New York City. He became interested in the history of African Americans in the United States. His research spanned the academic fields of history, sociology and anthropology. He challenged prevailing ideas about scientific racism and the social construction of race, demonstrated the connections between civilizations, and traced achievements of ethnic Africans, including some with mixed European ancestry. He was one of the earliest popularizers of African and African American history in the 20th century.\\"Joel Augustus Rogers\\", African-American Registry, accessed January 20, 2009. Biography Joel Augustus Rogers was born September 6, 1880 or 1883, in Negril, Jamaica. One of eleven children, he was the son of mixed-race parents who were a minister and schoolteacher. His parents could afford to give Rogers and his ten siblings only a rudimentary education, but stressed the importance of learning. Rogers claimed to have had a \\"good basic education\\". Rogers emigrated from Jamaica to the United States in 1906, living briefly in Chicago before settling in Harlem, New York. He became a naturalized citizen in 1916 and lived in New York most of his life. He was there during the Harlem Renaissance, a flowering of African American artistic and intellectual life in numerous fields. He became a close personal friend of Hubert Harrison, an intellectual and activist based in Harlem. While living in Chicago in the 1920s, Rogers worked as a Pullman porter and as a reporter for the Chicago Enterprise. His job of Pullman porter allowed him to travel and observe a wide range of people. Through this travel, he was able to feed his appetite for knowledge, by using various libraries in the cities which he visited. He self-published the results of his research in several books. =From \\"Superman\\" to Man= Rogers' first book From \\"Superman\\" to Man, self- published in 1917, attacked notions of African inferiority. From \\"Superman\\" to Man is a polemic against the ignorance that fuels racism. The central plot revolves around a debate between a Pullman porter and a white racist Southern politician. Rogers used this debate to air many of his personal philosophies and to debunk stereotypes about black people and white racial superiority. The porter's arguments and theories are pulled from a plethora of sources, classical and contemporary, and run the gamut from history and anthropology to biology. Rogers continued to develop ideas that he first expressed in From \\"Superman\\" to Man. He addresses issues such as the lack of scientific support for the idea of race, the lack of black history told from a black person's perspective, and the fact of intermarriage and unions among peoples throughout history. The book reveals Rogers' position on Christianity. When the second main character, the Senator asks, \\"Then you do not advocate Christianity for the Negro?\\". The main character Dixon then answers, \\"The real Christianity, yes. The usual Christianity of the white Gentile with its egotism and self- insterest, no.\\" Rogers also had many good things to say about Islam. When questioned about \\"Mohammedism\\" by the Senator, Dixon responds, =Newspaper career= In the 1920s, Rogers worked as a journalist on the Pittsburgh Courier and the Chicago Enterprise. He was a sub-editor of Marcus Garvey's short-lived Daily Negro Times. As a newspaper correspondent, Rogers covered such events as the coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia for the New York Amsterdam News. He wrote for a variety of other black newspapers and journals: Crisis, American Mercury, The Messenger Magazine, the Negro World and Survey Graphic. One of his interviews was with Marcus Garvey in prison (New York Amsterdam News, November 17, 1926). Rogers served as one of few black US war correspondents during World War II. Rogers also contributed to a syndicated newspaper cartoon feature entitled Your History. Patterned after the look of Robert Ripleys popular Believe It or Not cartoons, multiple vignettes in each cartoon episode recounted short items about African Americans from Rogers' research. The feature began in the Pittsburgh Courier in November 1934, with art by George L. Lee. In 1940, the art chores were handed over to Samuel Milai, who stayed with the feature through the rest of its run. In 1962, the title was changed to Facts About The Negro. The feature outlived its author, and continued appearing regularly until 1971, presumably in reprints at the end of the run. Two collections were published, Your History (1940) and Facts About The Negro c. 1960.Holtz, Allan. \\"Your History\\", Stripper's Guide, April 22, 2011. =Death= Rogers died on March 26, 1966 in New York City.\\"Joel Rogers, 85, Author Of Afro-American Books\\", The New York Times, March 27, 1966; accessed May 20, 2007. He was survived by his wife, Helga M. Rogers. =Other works= Rogers' work was concerned with \\"the Great Black Man\\" theory of history. This theory presented history, specifically black history, as a mural of achievements by prominent black people. He devoted a significant amount of his professional life to unearthing facts about people of African ancestry, intending these findings to be a refutation of contemporary racist beliefs about the inferiority of blacks. Books such as 100 Amazing Facts about the Negro, Sex and Race, and World's Great Men of Color described remarkable black people throughout the ages and cited significant achievements of black people. He asserted that several historical figures previously classified or assumed to be \\"white\\" (European), including Aesop, Cleopatra, and Hannibal, were \\"black\\". This was decades before research by later Afrocentric historians (overwhelmingly rejected by specialist consensus) tried to support some of his work. Rogers commented on the partial black ancestry of some prominent Europeans, including Alexander Pushkin and Alexandre Dumas, p√®re. Similarly, Rogers claimed that several portraits of Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, a direct ancestor of the British royal family, depicting her with \\"broad nostrils and heavy lips\\" indicated a \\"Negroid strain.\\" Rogers' theories about race, sex and color can be found in his books Nature Knows No Color-Line, World's Great Men of Color. His pamphlet Five Negro Presidents provided what he said was evidence that some 19th- and 20th-century presidents of the United States had partially black ancestry. His research in this book inspired Auset Bakhufu's book Six Black Presidents: Black Blood: White Masks USA (1993). Neither of these has gained consensus. Scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr., said that Rogers' pamphlet would \\"get the \\"Black History Wishful Thinking Prize,\\" if one existed.Henry Louis Gates, Jr. \\"J. A. Rogers‚Äô 100 Amazing Facts About the Negro\\", originally posted on The Root, PBS: The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross, 2013; accessed 30 October 2017 Rogers surmised that ethnic differences arose from sociological factors. He believed that such differences between groups were often attributed primarily to \\"physical\\" differences such as race. He deals with the themes of race and sex In Sex and Race and also in Nature Knows No Color-Line. Rogers' research in these works was directed to examining migration and movement of populations, and evidence for intermarriage and interracial unions throughout human history. He contended that it resulted in a black \\"strain\\" in Europe and the Americas. In Nature Knows No Color-Line, Rogers examined the origins of racial hierarchy and the color problem. He stated that the origins of the race problem had never been adequately examined or discussed. He believed that color prejudice generally evolved from issues of domination and power between two physiologically different groups. He thought that color prejudice was used as a rationale for domination, subjugation and warfare. Societies developed myths and prejudices in order to pursue their own interests at the expense of other groups. He was trying to show that there is nothing innate about color prejudice; that there is no natural distaste for darker skin by lighter-skinned people; and that there is no natural aversion for lighter skin by darker-skinned people. Sex and Race describes Rogers' theory regarding the origin of the races themselves, claiming that original humans were light-skinned, though similar to black Africans. One strain became the modern \\"white\\" race, the other in Africa becoming black Africans. All other races are their descendants to greater or lesser degrees. None is regarded as superior to any other. Within these works, Rogers questioned the concept of race, the origins of racial differentiation, and the root of the \\"color problem\\". Rogers felt that the \\"color problem\\" was that race was used as social, political and economic determining factors. Philosophy and viewpoint Rogers was a meticulous researcher, astute scholar and concise writer. He traveled tirelessly on his quest for knowledge, which often took him directly to the source. While traveling in Europe, he frequented libraries, museums, and castles, finding sources that helped him document African ancestry and history. He challenged the biased viewpoint of Eurocentric historians and anthropologists. Rogers gathered what he called \\"the bran of history\\". The bran of history was the uncollected, unexamined history of the world, and his interest was the history of black people. Rogers intended that the neglected parts of history would become part of the mainstream body of Western history. He saw black inclusion in white historical discourses as helping to bridge racial divides. His scholarship was meant to shed light on hitherto unexamined areas of Africana history, as well as combat the stereotypes of inferiority that were attributed to black people. Rogers asserted that the color of skin did not determine intellectual genius, and that Africans had contributed more to the world than was previously acknowledged. He publicized the great black civilizations that had flourished in Africa during antiquity. He devoted his scholarship to vindicating a place for African people within Western history. According to Rogers, many ancient African civilizations had been primal molders of Western civilization and culture. With these assertions, Rogers was also highlighting the absurdity of racial divisions. His belief in one race ‚Äì humanity ‚Äì precluded the idea of several different ethnic races. In this, he was a humanist. He used history as a tool to bolster his ideas about humanism, and his scholarship to prove his underlying humanistic thesis: that people were one large family without racial boundaries. Rogers was self-financed, self-educated, and self-published. Some critics have focused on his lack of a formal education as a hindrance to producing scholarly work; others suggested the fact that he was self-taught liberated him from many academic and methodological restrictions. As an autodidact, Rogers followed his research into various disciplines that more formally educated scholars may have been loath to attempt. His works are complete with detailed references. That he documented his work to encourage scrutiny of his facts was a testament to his due diligence, work ethic and commitment to the world's history and culture. Rogers articulated ideas about race that were informed by anthropology and biology, rather than social convention. He used what he discovered in his research as a tool to express his humanist beliefs, and to illustrate the unity of humanity. He discarded the non-scientific definition of race and pursued his own ideas about humanity's inter-connectedness. While his work has often been classified as Afrocentric and outside mainstream history, his main contribution to African scholarship was his nuanced analysis of the concept of race. Legacy and honors Rogers was a member of professional associations including the Paris Society of Anthropology, the American Geographical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Academy of Political Science.

Dick (serving as the executor of his literary estate) and Theodore Sturgeon. Career While briefly enrolled at Swarthmore College, Williams created :Crawdaddy!, the first national US magazine of rock music criticism, in January 1966 with the help of some of his fellow science fiction fans (he had previously produced science fiction fanzines).Dylan Gives the People What He Wants by Bill Wyman, The New York Times, June 12, 2005.http://www.crawdaddy.com/index.php/2008/05/14/and-so-it-began- remembering-the-first-issue/All Yesterdays Parties: The Velvet Underground in Print, 1966-1971 by Clinton Heylin, p. xvii. His aim was to reflect the sophistication brought to pop music by two albums released in 1965: Bob Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home and the Beatles' Rubber Soul. The first issue was ten mimeographed pages written entirely by Williams.http://www.crawdaddy.com/index.php/2008/05/14/and-so-it-began- remembering-the-first-issue/http://www.deaddisc.com/books/Crawdaddy.htm In that issue, he declared that Crawdaddy! would include \\"neither pin-ups nor news-briefs\\" and that \\"the specialty of this magazine is intelligent writing about pop ...\\" He left the magazine in 1968 and reclaimed the title in 1993, but had to end it in 2003 due to financial difficulties. Williams was the author of more than 25 books, of which the best-known are Outlaw Blues, Das Energi, and Bob Dylan: Performing Artist, the acclaimed three-part series. Williams was a leading authority on the works of musicians Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, and Neil Young, and science fiction writers Philip K.

His final published books were The 20th Century's Greatest Hits (a \\"Top 40\\" list that includes movies, books & other documents)(2000)) and the last volume of his critical look at the music of Bob Dylan, Bob Dylan: Mind Out of Time (Performing Artist Vol. 3, 1987-2000) (2004). In 1981 he edited and published, with David G. Hartwell, the first book edition of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (with the book entitled The International Bill of Human Rights), with a foreword by Jimmy Carter. Williams also made significant contributions to David G. Hartwell's book length analysis of science fiction, Age of Wonders: Exploring the World of Science Fiction (Walker & Co., 1985; ), and Hartwell mentions Paul Williams prominently in the book's acknowledgements.  Association with Philip K. Dick  In the spring of 1967 Williams was introduced to the fiction of Philip K. Dick by Trina Robbins, Bhob Stewart and Art Spiegelman.Williams, Paul, (1986), Only Apparently Real: The World of Philip K. Dick New York: Arbor House Publishing Company, pp. 14-15, He introduced himself to Dick in August 1968 at the 26th World Science Fiction Convention in Berkeley, California, beginning a friendship that lasted through the rest of Dick's life.Williams, Paul, (1986), Only Apparently Real: The World of Philip K. Dick New York: Arbor House Publishing Company, pp. 14-15, In 1974, Williams began working on a profile of Dick for Rolling Stone. \\"The True Stories of Philip K. Dick\\", which appeared in the November 6, 1975 issue of the magazine, covered a variety of subjects, including many theories about the 1971 break-in of Dick's home in San Rafael, California, a 1972 suicide attempt in British Columbia, his subsequent move to Orange County, California, the politics of the era, and the relationship of Dick's drug use (including his amphetamine addiction and infrequent LSD experimentation) to his writing career.\\"The True Stories of Philip K. Dick\\", Paul Williams, Rolling Stone, November 6, 1975 Williams was Dick's literary executor for several years after Dick's death and used that position to get several of the author's previously unpublished neorealist novels into print. From 1983 to 1992, Williams ran the Philip K. Dick Society along with Andy Watson and Keith Bowden in the UK. PKDS had some thousands of members internationally and was a significant influence in publicising Dick's work internationally. It published 30 quarterly newsletters, some of which included previously unpublished Dick material. In 1986, Williams published Only Apparently Real: The World of Philip K. Dick, one of the first biographies of Dick. Williams is a featured interviewee in three documentaries about Dick: a biographical documentary BBC2 released in 1994 as part of its Arena arts series called Philip K Dick: A Day in the Afterlife,Arena - Philip K Dick: A day in the afterlife The Gospel According to Philip K.

According to Rolling Stone's David Felton, Williams told him he departed at night, as he felt he was being observed and would not be allowed to leave.\\"I said I was leaving the day before and they said I wouldn't be allowed to. They said they'd be watching me 24 hours a day. So I was super paranoid, super cautious. But that doesn't bother me. I mean, they owed it to me, in a sense, to keep me on the hill. If I grow enough, someday I may come back. I care about Mel Lyman more than anyone outside of myself; someday I may be able to care about him more than me. The people who can, have something really beautiful going.\\" Paul Williams, quoted by David Felton, in \\"The Lyman Family's Holy Siege of America\\" (originally appeared in Rolling Stone, Dec. 23, 1971, pp. 40-60). According to his official website, he also lived in a wilderness commune at Galley Bay in British Columbia.

It is in contrast to experimentation in the scientific method, in which the goal of the experiment is to test a scientific hypothesis instead of making predictions. Phenomenology is related to the philosophical notion in that these predictions describe anticipated behaviors for the phenomena in reality. Phenomenology is commonly applied to the field of particle physics, where it forms a bridge between the mathematical models of theoretical physics (such as quantum field theories and theories of the structure of space-time) and the results of the high-energy particle experiments. It is sometimes used in other fields such as in condensed matter physics and plasma physics, when there are no existing theories for the observed experimental data. Applications in particle physicsStandard Model consequences= Within the well-tested and generally accepted Standard Model, phenomenology is the calculating of detailed predictions for experiments, usually at high precision (e.g., including radiative corrections). Examples include: * Next-to-leading order calculations of particle production rates and distributions. * Monte Carlo simulation studies of physics processes at colliders. * Extraction of parton distribution functions from data. CKM matrix calculations The CKM matrix is useful in these predictions: * Application of heavy quark effective field theory to extract CKM matrix elements. * Using lattice QCD to extract quark masses and CKM matrix elements from experiment. =Theoretical models= In physics Beyond the Standard Model, phenomenology addresses the experimental consequences of new models: how their new particles could be searched for, how the model parameters could be measured, and how the model could be distinguished from other, competing models. Phenomenological analysis Phenomenological analyses, in which one studies the experimental consequences of adding the most general set of beyond-the-Standard-Model effects in a given sector of the Standard Model, usually parameterized in terms of anomalous couplings and higher-dimensional operators. In this case, the term \\"phenomenological\\" is being used more in its philosophy of science sense.

A full back, he previously played professionally in the Premier League for Sunderland, in the Football League for Huddersfield Town, and in the Scottish Premier League for Aberdeen. He also appeared in the Scottish Football League as a triallist for St Johnstone, and played in non-League football for Gateshead, Blyth Spartans, Chester-le-Street Town, Darlington 1883, Dunston UTS and Seaham Red Star. He ended his career in Australia, playing for state-level sides Holland Park Hawks and Peninsula Power. Club careerSunderland= Smith was born in Sunderland, and began his football career with his home-town club. He made his Sunderland first-team debut in the Football League Cup second round against Cheltenham Town in September 2005, in which he was sent off, receiving two bookings. In January 2006, he joined Football League One club Huddersfield Town on a month's loan, later extended for a second month, during which he played eight League games. After returning to Sunderland, Smith played in three Premier League matches at the end of the season, in the last of which he committed a bad tackle, described in The Independent as a \\"studs-up lunge\\", on Arsenal player Abou Diaby, causing the player to suffer a fractured ankle and ruptured ankle ligaments. Arsenal initially threatened legal action over the incident, and Diaby was out of action for eight months. =Scotland= Despite having signed a new one-year deal with Sunderland during the summer of 2006, Smith joined Scottish Premier League (SPL) club Aberdeen in August on a three-year contract. He made his debut appearance in the Dons' 1‚Äì1 draw against St Mirren in the SPL. After making just 13 appearances for the club, he was released at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season. After trial spells at Port Vale and Darlington, Smith turned out as a trialist for St Johnstone in their First Division match against Morton on 9 August 2008. Following that match, Saints manager Derek McInnes confirmed that Smith would continue to train with the squad for a week, and he played in the next two matches, but was not offered a contract. =Later career= Smith joined Conference North side Gateshead on 20 November 2008. He made ten starts, all but one in the league, and two substitute appearances, and was released at the end of the season. In March 2010, Smith signed for Blyth Spartans, also of the Conference North, with a view to regaining fitness. With the club in an injury crisis, he was named once on the substitutes' bench, but never appeared for the club. In the 2011‚Äì12 season, he played for Chester-le-Street Town in the Northern League second division. Smith was one of Martin Gray's first batch of signings as new manager of Darlington 1883, demoted to the Northern League First Division for 2012‚Äì13. Smith was released by Darlington at the end of November and signed for Dunston UTS in December. On 27 February 2013, Smith joined Seaham Red Star. On 19 July 2013, Smith rejoined Gateshead, managed by his brother Anth, after a trial spell during pre season. On 31 January 2014, Smith had his contract cancelled to allow him to pursue his career abroad. He landed in Australia where he joined Holland Park Hawks, captaining the side to consecutive promotions. In 2017, he left the club midseason to join Peninsula Power. He later returned to the North East, setting up a spray painting business.

Studer has performed more than eighty roles ranging from the dramatic repertoire to roles more commonly associated with lyric sopranos and coloratura sopranos, and, in her late stage, mezzo-sopranos. She is particularly known for her interpretations of the works of Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner. Early life and education Studer was born in Midland, Michigan, to Carl W. Studer and Elizabeth (born Smith) Studer, as one of three children. She studied piano and viola as a child, and began voice lessons at age 12 with Gwendolyn Pike, a local opera singer and voice teacher. She attended Herbert Henry Dow High School,Herbert Henry Dow High School 1973 Charger yearbook then transferred to the Interlochen Arts Academy for her junior and senior years and graduated from there in 1974. Following high school, Studer studied at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music but left the program after a year, deciding to move with her family to Tennessee. She continued her studies at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Vocal Performance in 1979. Studer won several awards and competitions during this time, including the High Fidelity/Musical America Award in 1977 and the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions in 1978. In the summer of 1979, Studer attended a course for foreign students on the art of the German Lied at the Schubert Institute in Baden bei Wien, Austria. In this program, Studer's teachers included Irmgard Seefried, Brigitte Fassbaender, and Hans Hotter. Hotter convinced Studer to remain in Europe to study further with him at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und darstellende Kunst, Vienna. Studer studied with Hotter for one year before launching out on her professional career. In 1979, she won the Franz-Schubert-Institut-Preis for excellence in Lied interpretation. Vocation1980s= In 1981, Studer was hired as a permanent member of the Bavarian State Opera by Wolfgang Sawallisch. She remained with the company for two consecutive seasons, singing mostly minor roles in their productions. Her lead roles at the Bavarian State Opera included the title role in Carl Maria von Weber's Euryanthe and Ma≈ôenka The Bartered Bride. It was while working with the Bavarian State Opera that Studer was first encouraged to study the works of Richard Wagner and the dramatic soprano repertoire. Up to this point she had focused mostly on the bel canto repertoire, with her only foray into German repertoire up to that point being through Lieder. She made her professional opera debut with the company as Helmwige in Wagner's Die Walk√ºre. At the end of the 1981‚Äì82 season, she left the Munich ensemble to join the Staatstheater Darmstadt for two seasons.

C., Charles C.) Wei (July 12, 1914 ‚Äì February 20, 1987) was a Chinese-born American businessman who created the Precision Club bidding system in contract bridge. Biography Wei was born in Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, China. He received his B.E. in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 1936. In 1942, during World War II, he went to the United States. After the war he became a successful entrepreneur in the shipping industry. Wei was a member of the ACBL Greater New York Bridge Association. As a player, he was renowned for partnership agreements to compete vigorously through the 2-level, especially at matchpoints. He sometimes played at the Mayfair Club. Wei died of complications from diabetes at age 72, in New York Hospital, then a resident of New York and Houston. He was survived by his wife Kathie Wei, a son, a daughter, and three stepchildren. Achievements in bridge In 1963, \\"with assistance from Alan Truscott\\" Wei developed the China bidding system, later called the Precision Club. He was not an expert player, and the system did not attract much attention from the bridge community. That changed when the Taiwan national team, trained and led by Wei, finished as runner-up in the 1969 Bermuda Bowl world team championship, relegating a strong North America team to third place. With two returning players and four new ones, Taiwan was losing finalists again in 1970, and these strong showings brought Wei and the Precision Club great recognition. In order to promote the system, Wei sponsored \\"a number of top-level teams\\" to use it. The most successful, which came to be called simply the Precision Team, formed in 1970 and won the ACBL Spingold knockout tournament that year, beating the defending champions who were also 1970 Bermuda Bowl champions. Before it disbanded mid-1973, the team won another Spingold and a Vanderbilt Cup, and two of its pairs finished first and second in the 1973 Sunday Times Invitational Pairs, London.Manley, p. 29. Italy's Blue Team, which had retired after beating Taiwan in 1969, adopted versions of the Precision system for its successful return to competitive international play in the 1972 World Team Olympiad. Its strongest pair, Giorgio Belladonna and Benito Garozzo, used their Super Precision version through the 1970s and led Italy to three more Bermuda Bowl championships 1973 to 1975. The great success of the Precision systems began a wave of strong club systems all over the world. According to Truscott, Precision systems constituted \\"by far the most popular non-standard method throughout the world\\" at the time of the inventor's death.

During the crisis the winning parties were unable to appoint their candidate for Mayor of Zagreb because the President of Croatia, Franjo Tuƒëman, refused to provide the formal confirmation of their decision. A centre-left coalition of winning parties continued to hold majority in the local assembly during the crisis and continued to suggest other candidates, but they were all eventually turned down by the President as Croatian law at the time required a formal Presidential confirmation of the appointment. Meanwhile, the city was run by the government-appointed acting mayor, which meant that the city de facto had two parallel administrations. The situation led to several huge protests and was not resolved until the next local elections in April 1997, after which two opposition members of the assembly switched to Tuƒëman's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party. This meant that HDZ finally succeeded in gaining the majority in the 50-seat assembly, which enabled the party to appoint their mayor, who was afterwards approved by Tuƒëman. Background The crisis had its origin in the factional struggle within the ruling party of Croatia at the time, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). In 1993 the former Prime Minister Josip Manoliƒá, head of security services and leader of HDZ party moderates gradually fell out of favour with President Franjo Tuƒëman, whose became increasingly aligned with extreme nationalists led by Defence Minister Gojko ≈†u≈°ak. In the spring of 1994, when it became apparent that Manoliƒá would lose his post of Speaker of the Chamber of Counties (the short-lived upper house body in the Croatian Parliament), him and Stjepan Mesiƒá, who was at the time Speaker of Parliament, organized a mass defection of HDZ members of parliament who formed a new party called Croatian Independent Democrats (HND), hoping to strip Tuƒëman of majority in the parliament. The attempt ultimately failed and Tuƒëman's party eventually managed to maintain power on the national level. However, in a number of local and regional assemblies the defection of HDZ members allowed opposition parties to gain majorities. One of these was the Zagreb County Assembly. For Tuƒëman this apparently represented an embarrassing setback that he had to revert in any way possible. He initiated legislation aimed at merging the two county-level administrative units (the Zagreb County and City of Zagreb) which would then require a new election for the enlarged assembly. The idea was to drown the opposition-controlled Zagreb County assembly with votes from the City of Zagreb constituency, which was at the time widely perceived as a solid HDZ stronghold. 1995 election The new law was passed and the date for the new by-election was called for 29 October 1995, coinciding with the next general election. It was believed that the widespread euphoria following the August 1995 Operation Storm and Croatian military success in the last stages of the still ongoing Bosnian War, together with a massive propaganda drive supported by the state-controlled media, would lead to Tuƒëman's party comfortably winning majority in the new municipal assembly. Although the first election results had showed HDZ gaining ground in rural areas of the former Zagreb County, opposition parties managed to achieve success in urban areas of Zagreb proper. This was very apparent in the blue- collar neighborhoods which switched support from HDZ to the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP), mainly due to the populist rhetoric of Zdravko Tomac and organizational abilities of Milan Bandiƒá, prominent SDP members at the time. As a result, HDZ eventually lost the elections for the new Zagreb assembly, and Zdravko Tomac became the new Speaker of the Assembly. Soon afterwards, opposition parties formed a governing coalition which elected Goran Graniƒá, a member of the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), for mayor. The crisis Croatian legislation at the time stipulated that the mayor of Zagreb had the status equal to a county prefect (≈æupan), and as such his appointment had to be confirmed by the President of Croatia. This was seen as a mere formality, because Tuƒëman had already made a precedent by confirming opposition prefects following the disastrous defeat of his party in the February 1993 local elections in Istria County. However, Tuƒëman surprised many by saying he would not allow an \\"opposition situation\\" in the Croatian capital. Commenting in February 1996 on the outcome of the election, he stated the following: :\\"What does it mean that the opposition has 60% of the vote? It is as if a farmer told you that he had 60 animals in his manor. Are those pigs or calves? Are those chicken or geese? Whereas every sensible farmer and man would know that, compared to such a flock, a single stud, let alone a pair of studs or cows, is worth more than an entire flock.\\" Tuƒëman refused to confirm the appointment of an opposition mayor, and the Croatian Government appointed a former city administration official and HDZ member Marina Matuloviƒá-Dropuliƒá as interim mayor. This caused a stalemate as Zagreb municipal assembly refused to acknowledge Matuloviƒá-Dropuliƒá as mayor, but with Tuƒëman's apparent refusal to confirm an opposition candidate, they were unable to appoint their own. Throughout the following 18 months, three other opposition candidates from HSLS ranks (Jozo Rado≈°, Ivo ≈†krabalo and Dra≈æen Budi≈°a) had been proposed by the municipal assembly, only to be denied the required presidential confirmation every time. A plan to appoint Ante Lediƒá, a businessman with strong links to HDZ, which was seen as a compromise solution, also failed. In the meantime, Matuloviƒá-Dropuliƒá continued to run city affairs. Protests and resolution The spectacle of the nation's capital having two administrations not recognizing each other and the country's leader refusing to acknowledge the will of the voters led many to believe that Croatia had experienced a dramatic drop in democratic standards during the war, and that this state of affairs would not be resolved as long as Tuƒëman remained in power. Increasingly paranoid remarks made by Tuƒëman in public, who began to describing his political opponents and their supporters as \\"foreign agents\\" and \\"enemies of the state\\" also contributed to that assessment. In November 1996, more than a year after the elections, and with the crisis still going on, the Croatian government decided not to renew the broadcast license for Radio 101, a popular local radio station known for vocal criticism of the ruling regime, and decided to award the license to Ninoslav Paviƒá, a media tycoon widely perceived to be rather tolerant to the regime, instead. The announcement of the decision sparked a mass protest which saw about 120,000 people gathered at the Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square on 21 November 1996 in the biggest demonstrations in Croatia's modern history. Although the immediate cause for the protest had been the desire to preserve a popular symbol of the city, many protesters used the rally as an opportunity to express disagreement with Tuƒëman and his authoritarian policies. At the same time, Tuƒëman was out of the country undergoing stomach cancer treatment at the Walter Reed Hospital in Washington. Upon hearing what was going on, Tuƒëman reportedly ordered the police to take action against protesters. The then Interior Minister Ivan Jarnjak reportedly refused to do so, which resulted in his resignation in mid- December. Following the protests, Radio 101 managed to retain its independence and broadcast license as the government's original decision was revoked. Upon returning to Croatia, Tuƒëman made statements attacking the protests, calling his opponents \\"green and yellow devils\\" and accusing them of being foreign mercenaries and traitors who sold out. Index.hr: Vrhovnikov roƒëendan: \\"Jesmo li se za ovo borili?\\" The regular City of Zagreb local elections were then held in April 1997. This time the opposition parties did not form a coalition and decided to run on separate tickets, allowing HDZ to win 24 out of 50 seats. When two representatives of the centre-right Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) switched to HDZ in exchange for lucrative government posts in the immediate aftermath of the election, HDZ finally gained an absolute majority in the municipal assembly. This enabled the party to legally appoint Marina Matuloviƒá-Dropuliƒá as mayor, who was then confirmed by Tuƒëman. This formally ended the crisis. However, in 1998 a mass rally was organised once again at the city's main square, this time by workers' unions. This time the reason for the rally was a drastic drop in the standard of living. The police, however, refused to issue the required permit for the gathering to take place, and police forces cordoned off the square to prevent protesters from reaching it. For several hours, angry citizens attempted to push back the police cordons, but were unsuccessful. The media attention focused on the event, further promoting the idea that Tuƒëman's rule was becoming increasingly authoritarian. Tuƒëman commented on all of these events yet again, by calling the people involved in them \\"small-time cattle\\" (\\"stoka sitnog zuba\\").CE-Review CROATIA: Coffee With the President In spite of the crisis' formal resolution in 1997, most citizens of Zagreb and large parts of the Croatian public refused to acknowledge the new administration, considering the crisis an ongoing event. In May 2000, four months after the general election in January in which HDZ had lost power at the national level, the new centre-left government of Ivica Raƒçan called for a special local by-election in Zagreb, which ultimately resulted in SDP's landslide victory and SDP's Milan Bandiƒá becoming mayor.

Peireskiopsis Vaupel is an orthographic variant. Description The shape of Pereskiopsis is not that of a typical cactus, since it has large green leaves and grows like a bush. Only the presence of areoles, usually with spines and glochids, and the flowers, allow it to be identified as a cactus. Flowers open during the day. Pereskiopsis is often used as a grafting stock for other cacti, as it promotes quick growth of the scion. Its small diameter makes it an excellent grafting stock for small seedlings, but many species will outgrow the stock and need to be re-grafted or rooted. Pereskiopsis are tropical cactus and can not withstand any frost. Maintain a temperature of approximately 12 ¬∞C during winter and be careful with water. The stem tends to rot very easily, especially with low temperatures when the plant is not actively growing. References #Anderson and Brown. Cactus Family.

The British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) made a detailed survey of this area in 1936‚Äì1937, and in correlating their work with that of Charcot applied the name Neny Fjord to the bay between Red Rock Ridge and Roman Four Promontory.

In 1954, Gerwis as an activist-based movement changed its name to Gerwani to signify its move towards a mass organization to appeal to communist supporters. Beginning with only 500 members in 1950, Gerwani claimed to have 1.5 million members in 1963. As one of the largest women's organizations in the 1950s, its broad membership was also a product of its close affiliation with the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI, or Communist Party of Indonesia) ‚Äì reflected in Gerwani's concerns particularly with helping poor women workers, as well as their alliances with various labor unions. Nonetheless, Gerwani was an independent organization with both a feminist, and PKI-led wing. By 1965, Gerwani claimed to have 3 million members. Under Sukarno‚Äôs Guided Democracy beginning in 1958, Gerwani‚Äôs advocacy for gender equality, equal labor rights, and women‚Äôs issues began to shift towards one more adherent with PKI and Sukarno‚Äôs interests. Gerwani‚Äôs priority by the 1960s was no longer feminism, but anti-imperialism and the ‚Äúnational unity of women to liquidate the remains of colonialism and feudalism.‚Äù Founding members such as S.K. Trimurti, eventually left Gerwani after becoming disillusioned with the trajectory of Gerwani's political involvement. Gerwani's affiliation with the PKI eventually led to their demise after the events of Gerakan 30 September (G30S, 30 September Movement) and the ‚Äúattempted‚Äù coup. The arrest and imprisonment of Gerwani members was justified by the fabricated involvement of Gerwani in the killings of the six Generals during G30S. The Lubang Buaya myth, as described as discussed by historians, claimed that Gerwani had performed sadistic, sexual crimes before and after killing the six Generals during G30S. More seriously, Lubang Buaya was used to justify the mass killings of communists in the period immediately after the G30S ‚Äì an incident that also led to the demise of Gerwani. The memorialization of the Lubang Buaya myth continues to be represented in the Monument of the Sacred Pancasila at the Lubang Buaya site today. Historical context Following Indonesian independence in 1950, the political milieu was fraught with competing interests between the military and the Partai Nasional Indonesia (National Indonesia Party, or PNI) represented by Sukarno, Islamic groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama (Council of Islamic Scholars, NU), PKI, and other women's organizations all vying for legitimacy within Indonesia's new parliamentary democracy. Scholars agree that in newly independent Indonesia, the short-lived democracy allowed a new space for women's organizations to flourish in their struggle for equal rights to political participation, economic opportunities and ‚Äúsocial and cultural‚Äù spheres. The new political freedom of the period allowed the full participation of women's organizations to push for equal political, economic, and social rights. As Blackburn relates, however, the lack of resources made the task of implementing policies aimed at gender equality, such as adult literacy, education, and equal pay for civil servants, difficult. Nonetheless, this period was essential for establishing political equality for men and women ‚Äì seen in the constitution that provided ‚Äúthe right to vote, participate in government and hold office‚Äù for men and women. Women's organizations in the early 1950s diverged on a number of issues related to their stance on issues of marriage, work, polygamy, and their perceived position as political or social organizations. Many of the national women's organizations were also aligned with political parties as ‚Äúsections of‚Äù political parties ‚Äì their affiliation thus determining how politicized their organization would be. For example, Gerwani was associated with the PKI, Muslim women's organization Muslimat, was affiliated with Masjumi, and Wanita Demokrat Indonesia with the PNI. The ties between women's organizations and political parties were often contingent on the expectation that gender interests would be fulfilled as part of the party's goals. Yet as Martyn describes, the failure to create a united women's political organization was the result of the divergent and conflicting ideological differences between the numerous women's organizations ‚Äì political, religious or otherwise. Women's organizations affiliated with political parties were also greatly influenced by the respective politics. There were also women's organizations that did not align themselves with any political party. Perwari for example, decided in 1952 that it ‚Äúoffered nothing new‚Äù because there were already women's political parties ‚Äì and it had been difficult to gain seats in parliament due to the diversity of its members‚Äô varied political alliances. Nonetheless, there was a central national body that did attempt to coordinate independent women's organizations: Kongres Wanita Indonesia (Kowani). Kowani was the central national body that coordinated independent women's organizations working towards the common goal of improving the lives of women. As Martyn aptly describes, gender was the central signifier of difference between women's organizations because of the different interests represented that ranged from ‚ÄúMuslim women, as army wives, as secular non-aligned women, as university graduates, as doctors‚Äô wives, as communist women, as Catholic women, as nurses.‚Äù As such, it was too varied to take a single political stance. Under Kowani‚Äôs directives, women‚Äôs organizations often tried to work to meet the socio-economic needs as part of the ‚Äúdevelopment of the young state‚Äù through initiatives that focused on education, social welfare, and health. =Gerwani= Gerwani differed from the other women's organizations because of the contentious issue of polygamy and marriage reform. Wieringa argues that Gerwani diverged from other women's organizations because Gerwani did not regard marriage reform as the only ‚Äúvalid‚Äù issue for political mobilization and advocacy of gender equality. In Wieringa's words, Gerwani was the only women's organization that ‚Äúclaimed politics‚Ä¶as a legitimate field for women‚Äù because it was the most active on the ‚Äúnational political level.‚ÄùIn 1950-1954, the preoccupation with marriage reform was the main issue that concerned many women's organizations due to the need to settle women's rights to do with marriage, polygamy, and child marriage. Other issues that women's organizations were concerned with included education, work, citizenship, violence, and motherhood. In essence, women's organizations conflicted over their perceptions of what the best approaches were for achieving the same ends. For example, even though all women's organizations supported the importance of education, some such as Persit, a wives' organization, rationalized its importance in terms of motherhood and citizenship whereby education would improve women's roles as wives in the home to ‚Äúbetter assist her husband in his career.‚Äù Gerwani however, focused on educating their members about socialism. The women's movement in the 1950s worked towards a common goal of improving women's lives within the nation- building project. The historical scholarship on the range of women's organizations makes it clear that there was no single coherent approach or political, religious ideology by which women's organizations agreed upon. History of Gerwani On 4 June 1950, a group of representatives of six women's organizations from various areas of Indonesia united to form Gerwis in Semarang. Communist and nationalist women from various women's organizations whose shared experience in the Indonesian National Revolution had motivated their search for a single organization that could represent their interests as ‚Äúfully conscious women.‚Äù Coming from women's organizations of Rupindo (Rukun Putri Indonesia), Persatuan Wanita Sedar from Surabaya, Isteri-Sedar from Bandung, Gerakan Wanita Indonesia (Gerwindo) from Kediri, Wanita Madura from Madura and Perjuangan Putri Republik Indonesia from Pasuruan, the founders all shared a common experience fighting for the Indonesian National Revolution against the Dutch and the Japanese. Like other women's organizations in the 1950s, Gerwis focused on women's issues within nationalism. As historian Elizabeth Martyn describes, these efforts to amalgamate local organizations into nationwide initiatives for Gerwis and other local women's organizations, was a ‚Äúreflection of the developing national identity.‚Äù Gerwis in the early 1950s was one of the only organizations that represented poor, rural women beyond marriage reform ‚Äì regarding women's issues as extending beyond the family and the home to include the lives of poor, working women. Gerwis‚Äô constituting both communist and nationalist women was reflected in their mixed approach to approach to women's issues ‚Äì a combination later dominated by the increasing influence of the PKI. According to Blackburn, Wieringa and Martyn, Gerwani's politics were radical only by comparison to other organizations, a deciding factor that made Gerwani a ‚Äúthreat to conservative powers.‚Äù Nonetheless, this shift from a women's organization to a decidedly communist organization with mass appeal was reified in the name change in 1954 from Gerwis to Gerwani to signify the beginning of a new mass movement. =Gerwis to Gerwani= Scholars such as Blackburn and Martyn mark 1954 as when Gerwis decidedly changed to Gerwani Wieringa however, has traced this shift to a much earlier moment beginning with the first Gerwis conference in 1951. Gerwis‚Äô new leadership under Aidit advocated for a new-PKI influenced that aimed at gaining mass appeal. There were many members who opposed this transition. As Wieringa's interview with Gerwis‚Äô member Sujinah shows: According to the Gerwani leadership in 1965, this shift had been necessary because Gerwis had been too narrow as a platform only for ‚Äúconscious women‚Äù ‚Äì as the name Gerakan Wanita Indonesia Sedar, or the Movement of Conscious Indonesian Women, suggested. Another factor that contributed to this shift in 1954 was the increased PKI pressure for Gerwani to be a mass organization for women. By 1954, Gerwani had about 80,000 members. This shift towards a mass organization was to address the issues facing poor, female workers. In 1955, Gerwani leader, Umi Sarjono, explained that the organization specifically wanted to help working women with pragmatic needs before women would be willing to participate in politics ‚Äì especially because their priorities were not gender equality, but basic subsistence. This shift was also part of Gerwani's strategy after 1954 to have alliances not only with the PKI, but also with trade unions in order to broaden their ability to address women's issues. As Blackburn details, trade unions were overwhelmingly male dominated, and Gerwani worked towards increasing awareness of women's issues and advocating changes that would improve the lives of women workers and their families. Unions were also linked to political parties. As such Gerwani's alliances with PKI-affiliated unions such as All-Indonesian Labor Unions Federation (Sentral Organisasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia, SOBSI) and Indonesian Farmers‚Äô Front (Barisan Tani Indonesia, BTI) were able to directly push for women's issues through communist unions and the PKI. Gerwani, feminism, and the PKIFeminism= One of the founding leaders of Gerwani in its early years, Trimurti left the organization after becoming disillusioned with its direction in the 1960s Gerwani's ideology about women in Indonesian society largely diverged from the state's traditional view of kodrat. Kodrat posited women as subordinate to the household and the family as mothers and wives, while men were the breadwinners. Unlike Gerwani, other women's organizations supported kodrat as the underlying ideology. Gerwani on the other hand, adopted a different view of gender that was shaped by the PKI's communist ideology. It remained however, a ‚Äúnon-political party‚Äù with the main purpose of attracting support for the PKI. Gerwani's regarded women's issues as highly intertwined with the project of nation-building, and in particular, a socialist vision of Indonesia that aimed at ameliorating the female ‚Äúexploitation and discrimination because of feudalism and imperial remnants.‚Äù The emphasis for Gerwis in the 1950s was thus more on workers as mothers and citizens in Indonesia's body politic. This focus was furthered by their 1954 shift that represented Gerwani was an ‚Äúorganization for education and struggle‚Äù open to Indonesian women who were sixteen years or older. Members of Gerwani were also allowed to remain members of other women's organizations and trade unions like SOBSI. Wieringa however, has argued that Gerwani's stance on gender amalgamated essentialist constructions of women as mothers with their duties as workers and citizens. It is for this reason that scholars agree that Gerwani was not as radical as portrayed by the New Order ‚Äì particularly because Gerwani regarded the differences between men and women as a product of ‚Äúsocial problems‚Äù, rather than gender as socially constructed. Gerwani's activities in the 1950s involved implementing changes at the village level to help working women in rural areas, such as cr√®ches to care for children, kindergartens, literacy classes, as well as classes for cadres. A unique perspective of Gerwani has been described in Rachmi Larasati's work on dance in the New Order period and cultural construction. As Larasati argues, Gerwani and women's organizations used ‚Äútraditional art idioms‚Äù to convey their critiques of education, polygamy, and rights in the workplace for women. Other activities Gerwani organized in the 1950s were demonstrations protesting the increase in food prices, abuses in marriage, and prostitution. Gerwani advocated education for children, adult literacy, increased political participation of women, classes to train cadres how to be simultaneously independent and politically active, women workers, mothers and wives. In the 1960s however, there was a considerable focus on nation-building, rather than women's issues. The focus was now on struggling for a nation first, then women's rights. However, Gerwani's socialist vision of the ‚Äúnew Indonesian woman‚Äù must also be contextualized vis-√†-vis their relationship with the PKI ‚Äì particularly because this affiliation was ultimately, what led to the Gerwani being targeted, and later banned in the Suharto‚Äôs New Order. =Gerwani and the PKI= Gerwani‚Äôs ambivalent relationship with the PKI has been detailed by historians that have discussed it largely in the context of the Indonesian killings of 1965-66, the Indonesian military, and the beginning of the New Order (Indonesia) under Suharto. The organization‚Äôs close ties with the PKI deepened following the inception of President Sukarno‚Äôs Guided Democracy in 1959. Gerwani‚Äôs efforts to focus on the rights, education and issues of poor, rural women in the 1950s were superseded in the 1960s by class struggle for the establishment of a socialist Indonesia. In other words, establishing communist Indonesia was regarded as the primary solution for resolving women‚Äôs issues. Nationalism and communism were considered complementary in this case, particularly because both ideologies proposed a new, ‚Äúmodern‚Äù Indonesia. This is seen in Gerwani's vision of the new Indonesian woman that was ‚Äúmodern in dress, cultural outlook, and political vision‚Äù based on socialist principles. The PKI and Gerwani however, did have conflicts in what constituted women's issues. As Wieringa details, the PKI hardly supported the ‚Äúwoman question‚Äù beyond support for democratic marriage laws, equal rights, land rights, and equal wages for women. Women, as Wieringa argues, was ‚Äúlow on the PKI list of priorities.‚Äù Similarly, Gerwani's demonstrations against price increases for food and clothing was a non-issue for the PKI in the 1960s. From the 1960s onwards, Gerwani's shift towards ‚Äúmilitant motherhood‚Äù in line with PKI agendas was an association that cost them dearly in the 30 September Movement (Gerakan 30 September, G30S) as seen in the fabrication of the Lubang Buaya myth used partly to justify the banning and imprisonment of PKI members, as well as any affiliated organizations. Gerwani, the G30S movement and the Lubang Buaya myth The events of G30S has been described in the official narrative in a number of ways ‚Äì but in relation to Gerwani, the G30S movement fabricated the Lubang Buaya (Crocodile Hole) myth that accused the Gerwani and Pemuda Rakyat of torturing, performing sadistic sexual acts to, and finally killing the six Generals. Scholars who have studied this history and Gerwani's supposed involvement argue that Gerwani was perceived as a threat to the ‚Äúidealized Indonesian identity‚Äù in the New Order ‚Äì a view exacerbated by Gerwani's close ties with the PKI. Other scholars have detailed how the Lubang Buaya myth allowed the Army to blame the PKI for the murder of the six generals ‚Äì thereby giving then Lieutenant General Suharto, the opportunity to claim that the Indonesian military had the ‚Äúsacred duty of protecting the country‚Äù by eliminating all PKI members and supporters. Harold Crouch, for example, traces this ‚Äúsense of duty‚Äù and the increasing involvement of the army in Indonesian politics to the independence period, as ‚Äúguardians of the nation‚Äù intervening where the government failed - culminating in the introduction of martial law in 1957 for Sukarno's Guided Democracy. This uneasy balance between Sukarno, the PKI and the military escalated in the 1960s when Sukarno adopted the three pillars: Nationalism, Religion, and Communism. The new inclusion of PKI in political power affected new changes in policies promoting ‚Äúland redistribution, arming workers and peasants as a ‚Äòfifth force‚Äô to‚Ä¶counter the power of the army, navy, air force, and police.‚Äù The official narratives of the G30S movement have been described in a number of ways ‚Äì but the Lubang Buaya myth‚Äôs portrayal of Gerwani was the most sensationalist. Scholars have described how the myth was used to discredit the PKI not simply by virtue of their involvement in a ‚Äúsupposed coup‚Äù ‚Äì but also because of the depraved morality of communist sexuality and gender. John Roosa describes it as one of ‚Äúsensational journalism‚Äù composed by ‚ÄúArmy psychological warfare specialists.‚Äù Army newspaper reports from Angkatan Bersendjata claimed that Gerwani women had been torturing, mutilating, ‚Äúplaying with and fondling the genitals of the victims while at the same time displaying their own‚Ä¶‚Äù before they proceeded to kill the generals. These descriptions of mutilation, torture, and immoral sexuality further accused the ‚ÄúGerwani mothers of evil‚Äù of using ‚ÄúLieutenant Tendean as an obscene plaything.‚Äù The macabre deaths of the generals supposedly at the hands of Gerwani members was used to create the impression that communist women were morally depraved and sexually loose ‚Äì the complete antithesis of the idealized Indonesian women. Autopsies performed on 4‚Äì5 October 1965 however, proved the unsubstantiated nature of these claims because the generals were not mutilated ‚Äì but had in fact, died of gunshot wounds. Aftermath of the Lubang Buaya myth and the G30S The aftermath of official claims of sexually depraved, immoral, murderous communist women in the G30S was one aspect used by the Army to fuel hysteria and increase anti-communist sentiment. As Steven Drakeley argues, the events at Lubang Buaya ‚Äúpoisoned the party‚Äôs name‚Äù for those in the Indonesian Armed Forces that were previously sympathetic or ambivalent towards the PKI. In other words, the Lubang Buaya myth contributed to the denigration and subsequent elimination of Gerwani, the PKI, and communist sympathizers because they were antithetical to Indonesian identity ‚Äì particularly in its politics that seemed to advocate uncontrollable, crazed women who had ‚Äúoverstepped their boundaries.‚Äù After 1965, most of the Gerwani members were killed, arrested, or imprisoned without trial for years. Gerwani members were frequently raped and then beaten to death or executed together with their entire families. ‚ÄúConfessions‚Äù of Gerwani members detailing the supposed ‚Äúinvolvement‚Äù in the G30S was part of the misogynist propaganda proliferated by the Army in the aftermath of the abortive coup. As Blackburn described, the tragedy of the G30S movement and the destruction of organizations like Gerwani and communist-dominated mass organizations such as SOBSI and BTI meant the obliteration of arenas where the needs of workers, and especially poor female workers, could be adequately represented. Genjer- genjer ‚ÄúGenjer-genjer‚Äù originated as a folk song in East Java the Osing language. The song is about an edible plant, genjer (Limnocharis flava), that grows abundantly in Java and therefore would commonly be eaten by peasants, especially in times of hardship. The folk song was first used in a political context during the Japanese Occupation as a way of encouraging people to lead an austere lifestyle, especially as the war created severe food shortages. After independence, the song became increasingly popular and was recorded by well-known artists such as Lilis Suryani and Bing Slamet. The song's subject matter, touching on the themes of hardship and perseverance in peasant life, made it popular with the PKI and many Indonesian's began to associate it with the party. According to the myth of Lubang Buaya propagated by the New Order, Gerwani and PKI youth group members sang the song as they killed the generals. The song's association with the PKI and Lubang Buaya caused the New Order to quickly ban it in any form. In reality, however, there is little evidence to support this myth; it was based on the discovery of the lyrics in a book of folk songs that belonged to a member of the PKI youth organization who had been at Halim AFB on October 1. The well into which the generals' bodies were dumped, 2013 Legacy Memory of the Lubang Buaya myth and the fabricated role of Gerwani's involvement was materialized in the Monumen Pancasila Sakti Lubang Buaya, as well as the propaganda film, Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI (The Treason of the G30S/PKI) that school children had to watch annually ‚Äì an experience described in Rachmi Larasati's book. Gerwani as one of the largest women's organizations in the 1950s, was banned in 1965 ‚Äì remembered in the decades under Suharto as traitors of the Indonesian nation. The anti-communist purges of 1965‚Äì66 and the defamation of Gerwani and leftist organizations were used to undergird the inception of Suharto's New Order as the arbiter of legitimacy, morality and order to the new Indonesian state.

Mathews joined the navy in 1690 and saw service on a number of ships, including during the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession. He interspersed periods spent commanding ships with time at home at the family estate in Llandaff. He distinguished himself with service with Sir George Byng at the Battle of Cape Passaro in 1718, and went on to command squadrons in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean, before largely retiring from naval service. He returned to active service in 1741, following Britain's entry to the War of the Austrian Succession, and took command of the fleet in the Mediterranean. The usual difficulties of performing delicate diplomatic duties were further exacerbated by the fact that he was on bad terms with his second in command, Richard Lestock, on whom he relied to manage the fleet. The pivotal moment of his naval career came in 1744, when he attempted to intercept a Franco-Spanish fleet at the Battle of Toulon. The action was fought in confused circumstances, with poor communications and the breakdown of the chain of command. Despite possessing the superior force, Mathews was unable to secure a decisive result, and the enemy were able to escape with the loss of one ship, while Mathews's fleet lost one and had several others badly damaged. The failure to secure a victory incensed the British public, and a series of courts-martial and a public inquiry led to several officers being cashiered. Mathews' second in command, Lestock, was tried but acquitted, blaming the outcome on Mathews' poor planning and ill- tempered and unwise attack. Mathews was tried and convicted of the charges, and dismissed from the navy. He returned to his estates at Llandaff, before moving to London and dying there in 1751. Family and early life He was born at Llandaff Court, Llandaff, the son of Colonel Edward Mathews (died 1700), and grandson on his mother's side of Sir Thomas Armstrong (1624‚Äì1684) (who was executed in 1684, for his part in the Rye House Plot). Mathews was also a descendant of the Welsh knight Sir David ap Mathew and King Louis VI of France. Mathews joined the navy in 1690, serving aboard , which was then under the command of his uncle, Sir Francis Wheler. Mathews served during the Nine Years' War, and may have been present at the Battle of Beachy Head, and was likely in action at the Battle of Barfleur. Mathews went on to serve aboard under Captain James Littleton in 1697, and on 31 October 1699 Vice-Admiral Matthew Aylmer appointed him lieutenant aboard his flagship, . Mathews served with Aylmer in the Mediterranean, before being moved to in 1700. Mathews went on to serve with John Graydon in the West Indies, being promoted by him to command , a position he took up on 24 May 1703. Command He commanded in the English Channel from 1704, and in October 1708 took command of . His next ship was the newly built , which was attached to the Channel fleet under Lord Berkeley. The fleet encountered a small French squadron under Ren√© Duguay- Trouin in early 1709. The British gave chase, re-capturing one of Duguay- Trouin's prizes, , and capturing another of his ships, Gloire. Mathews and Chester were then assigned to the fleet sent to reduce and capture Nova Scotia under Commodore George Martin in 1710, and took over command of the force after Martin's return to England. He joined the fleet commanded by Rear Admiral Sir Hovenden Walker at Boston in summer 1711, after which he escorted a convoy to New York City. Chester was badly damaged by heavy storms during this mission, and returned to Britain for repairs. Mathews then moved ashore, and spent the next few years at the family seat of Llandaff Court. Mathews returned to active service in January 1718, following the outbreak of war with Spain, with a temporary appointment to command HMS Prince Frederick, while a new ship, , was being fitted out. He took command of Kent on 31 March 1718, and joined Sir George Byng's fleet in the Mediterranean. He participated in the Battle of Cape Passaro in 1718, and was then detached in command of a squadron assigned to blockade Messina and hopefully intercept Vice-Admiral George Camocke, a British national serving with the Spanish navy. Camocke managed to evade the British and escape in a small boat in January however, and the British squadrons were occupied with blockading Sicily until autumn 1720, when Mathews returned to Britain with Byng. From 1722 to 1724 he was in command of a small squadron sent to the East Indies to expel the Indian Maratha Koli Admiral Kanhoji Angre of the Malabar Coast. The presence of his ships caused Angre's activity to be much reduced, but their strongholds remained impregnable. Mathews' squadron supported Portuguese troops from Goa in an attack on the Maratha fortress at Vijaydurg & Kolaba, but this was repulsed. Mathews returned to Britain in 1724 and thereafter largely retired from the navy, and received no further promotions. It was not until 1736 that he rejoined the service in any capacity, becoming Commissioner of Chatham dockyard, though the appointment was considered a civil one. War of the Austrian Succession The outbreak of war with Spain and the imminent threat of war with France during the early stages of the War of the Austrian Succession led to Mathews' return to active service, with a promotion directly to vice-admiral of the red on 13 March 1741. He was given a command in the Mediterranean, and made plenipotentiary to Charles Emmanuel III, king of Sardinia, and the other courts of Italy. The appointment was somewhat unexpected, Mathews was not especially distinguished, and had not served in the navy for a number of years. His second in command in the Mediterranean was Rear-Admiral Richard Lestock, a man Mathews knew from his time as commissioner at Chatham, when Lestock had commanded the guard ships stationed in the Medway. The two had not been on good terms, and on receiving the Mediterranean posting, Mathews requested that Lestock be recalled, a request the Admiralty declined to act upon. The two men continued their disagreements during their time in the Mediterranean, though Mathews' continued distractions with diplomatic duties meant that they did not break out into an open argument. In 1742 Mathews sent a small squadron to Naples to compel King Charles, later the King of Spain, to remain neutral. It was commanded by Commodore William Martin, who refused to enter into negotiations, and gave the king half an hour in which to return an answer. The Neapolitans were forced to agree to the British demands. In June 1742 a squadron of Spanish galleys, which had taken refuge in the Bay of Saint-Tropez, was burnt by the fire ships of Mathews' fleet. In the meantime a Spanish squadron had taken refuge in Toulon, and was watched by the British fleet from Hy√®res. On 21 February 1744 (N.S., 10 February O.S.) the Spaniards put to sea in company with a French force. Mathews, who had now returned to his flagship, followed, and an engagement took place on the 22 and 23 February. =Battle of Toulon= The Battle of Toulon, by Diego de Mesa The fleets had become scattered in the light winds as they approached, and as they began to form up for the Battle of Toulon on 22 February, Mathews signalled for the formation of the line of battle. The line had still not been formed as night fell, leading Mathews to hoist the signal to come to, intending for his ships to first finish forming the line. The van and centre squadrons did so, but Lestock commanding the rear obeyed the order to come to, without having formed the line. By daybreak on 21 February, the rear of the British fleet was separated by a considerable distance from the van and centre. Mathews signalled for Lestock to make more sail, reluctant to start the attack with his ships still disorganised, but the slowness of Lestock to respond caused the Franco-Spanish force to start to slip away to the south. Mathews feared that they would escape him, and pass through the Strait of Gibraltar to join the French force gathered at Brest for the planned invasion of Britain. Knowing that his duty was to attack, Mathews hoisted the signal to engage the enemy aboard his flagship , and at one o'clock left the line to attack the Spanish rear, followed by Captain James Cornewall aboard HMS Marlborough. In doing so, the signal to form the line of battle was left flying. The two signals flying simultaneously created confusion, though a number of British commanders, including Captain Edward Hawke, followed Mathews' example. Heavily outnumbered and unsupported, with his other commanders either too uncertain, or in the case of Lestock, possibly pleased to see Mathews in difficulty and unwilling to help him, Namur and Marlborough managed to defeat their opposite numbers in the enemy line, but suffered considerable damage. The French ships came about at 5 o'clock to aid the Spanish, a manoeuvre interpreted by some of the British commanders to be an attempt to double the British line and surround them. With no orders from Mathews and a lack of clear instructions or command structure, the British line broke, and began to flee to the northwest. The Spanish, still on the defensive, neglected to capture the defenceless Marlborough, though they did retake the Poder, which had previously surrendered to the British. The Franco- Spanish fleet then resumed their flight to the southwest, and it was not until 23 February that the British were able to regroup and resume the pursuit. They caught up with the enemy fleet again, which was hampered by towing damaged ships, and were able to retake the Poder, which Mathews ordered to be burnt. By now the British had closed to within a few miles of the enemy fleet but Mathews again signalled for the fleet to come to. The following day, 24 February, the Franco-Spanish fleet was almost out of sight, and Mathews returned to Hy√®res, and sailed from there to Port Mahon, where he arrived in early March. Inquiry and dismissal The failure of the British fleet to bring a decisive action against an inferior foe had significant consequences. The opposing fleet was able to deliver troops and supplies to the Spanish army in Italy, swinging the war in their favour. This was widely remarked on back in Britain. The House of Commons petitioned King George II for a public inquiry. A dozen captains were tried by court-martial and cashiered. Lestock was also tried, but was able to place the blame on Mathews, and, with the help of powerful supporters in government, was acquitted and offered further employment. Mathews was tried by court-martial in 1746, on charges of having brought the fleet into action in a disorganised manner, of having fled the enemy, and of having failed to bring the enemy to action when the conditions were advantageous. In his defence, it was shown that he had fought bravely. However, in June 1747, the court judged the charges were proven and Mathews was dismissed from the service. Mathews had devoted himself to work at his estate at Llandaff, and did not appear to be affected by the result of the trial. He regarded the outcome as down to factional party politics, rather than as a reflection on his conduct. Mathews moved to Bloomsbury Square in 1749 and died there on 2 October 1751. He was buried at St George's, Bloomsbury. Personality Mathews' personality was the subject of particular study during the controversy over Toulon, with his detractors claiming that he was hot-headed, intemperate, and incapable of managing the complex task of commanding a fleet in battle, which had led to the defeat. Horace Walpole, in his correspondence with Sir Horace Mann, noted that \\"Mathews believes that Providence lives upon beef and pudding, loves prize-fighting and bull-baiting, and drinks fog to the health of Old England.\\" In a speech in the Commons Walpole declared \\"Mathews remains in the light of a hot, brave, imperious, dull, confused fellow.\\" Mann, who was strongly opposed to how Naples' neutrality had been violated during Mathews' tenure as commander in the Mediterranean, declared \\"'Tis wonderful how void Admiral Mathews is of common sense, good manners, or knowledge of the world. He understands nothing but Yes or No, and knows no medium.\\" Walpole and his correspondents often referred to Mathews as \\"Il Furibondo\\". Despite their criticism, those who knew Mathews personally, while admitting that he could be hot-tempered, described him as \\"warm-hearted, kindly and affectionate; a clear-sighted magistrate, a capable farmer, and a keen sportsman\\". Family and issue Mathews married Henrietta Burgess, of Antigua, in 1705. The couple had a son, Thomas, who became a major in the army. Henrietta died about 1740, and Mathews remarried about 1745, to Millicent Powell.

Background, functions and boundaries Apart from the town of Staines itself which included a few rural pockets aside from its large moor until the 1940s, the district also covered the suburban settlements of Ashford and Stanwell and Laleham. In the far north, Stanwell and Staines Moor (collectively known as Staines Moor) formed the main agricultural area at the time of disbandment of the area. During its existence a significant amount of Staines Urban District's land was transferred to the Metropolitan Water Board to form two large reservoirs and a small percentage of a third. An aqueduct and pumping station were made c. 1902 when the Staines Reservoirs were constructed across the parish boundary in Stanwell, a main cemetery, in London Road was opened in 1911 by this authority and a cottage hospital in Kingston Road in 1914. Between the two wars building spread along the London Road, where the London Transport garage was opened in 1934. The chief area of development was to the south, around the Kingston and Laleham Roads. The 'bungalow town' of what were initially simply brick-built retirement properties with gardens in South Staines or the tithing of 'Penton' towards Penton Hook was in existence by 1919. By the demise of the area many of these plots had been transformed into the two-storey houses of London commuters and affluent workers. Between the Second World War and 1964 much of the remaining land in the south of the parish was built over. Many of the houses of Staines are detached or semi-detached, with some terraces dating from the 19th century A significant planned housing and population increase took place here as in the rest of the county during the existence of its County Council. In 1894, under the Local Government Act 1894, Staines was changed to an urban district of Middlesex. It originally just covered the parish of Staines. In 1930 the civil parishes of Ashford, Laleham and Stanwell were added from the disbanded Staines Rural District. The Minister for Local Government and Housing considered objections from the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London to place 14 urban districts in Greater London and the Staines urban district was one of 8 such districts to be excluded on objection. On 1 April 1965, when Middlesex was abolished and most of its former area was transferred to Greater London under the London Government Act 1963, Staines Urban District was one of three Urban Districts transferred to Surrey or to Hertfordshire. Staines with Middlesex county in 1961 Members and programmes At the outset 12 members convened. On the addition of the three settlements mentioned in 1930 this number doubled. The council met fortnightly until 1897, and until its demise generally met once a month. In 1886 there were seven committees, for the town hall, commons, cemetery, highways, hospital, finance, and drainage. The provision of a sewerage system was the first major task confronting the local board, and was finally accomplished in 1896, laying main sewers through four parishes beyond to reach the major works at Twickenham which avoided acquiring costly riverside land at Staines: its importance in the council's affairs is reflected in the fact that 'general purposes' became associated in the title of the drainage committee in 1897 and the two were not divided until 1930. The hospital committee was dissolved soon after it was formed, without having provided a hospital. In 1957 the council had ten committees, and two standing sub-committees. By 1939 the urban district contained 500 council houses, of which 94 were in Staines itself. Between 1947 and 1957 a further 1,369 were built almost all in the former Rural District - two, were in Staines parish and these are described as 'sold'. In 1896-7 the council spent nearly ¬£8,000, and in 1955-6 nearly ¬£624,000, of which ¬£525,000 went to the county council and Metropolitan Police. Apart from those employed on the roads, cemeteries, and others, the original staff comprised the clerk, surveyor, and medical officer of health. By 1957 there was also a treasurer, and the four principal officers had a subordinate staff of about 100. The local firm of solicitors Horne, Engall and Freeman provided the clerks to the select vestry, local board, and council, as well as to most of the other local bodies, from 1823 to 1946, when a full-time clerk was appointed. After the World War I the town hall at an oblique angle to the river became too small for the council's offices, which were transferred to nearby buildings in Clarence Street, given up in 1952, and in Bridge Street. The surveyor's department moved to the London Road in 1950 and the clerk's department to no. 73, High Street in 1952. A school board of five members was formed for Staines in 1885. This took over all the existing elementary schools, but did not build any new ones until 1896. Its functions were transferred to the county council in 1902. Coat of arms The district's coat of arms was granted in 1951. It is described as: Gules on a fess barry wavy of four argent and Azure between in chief two swans respectant proper and in base a representation of London Stone Or between two seaxes (Saxon swords) blades upwards and outwards of the second hilted and pommelled a representation of the Staines Bridge Or. The crest is: On a wreath of the colours upon the battlements of a tower Or a greyhound sejeant gules. The motto is Latin for \\"At the bridges we look forward\\". The bridge is Staines Bridge, and the waves on which it stands is the River Thames. The London Stone is the local landmark, and the swans are associated with the river. The seaxes derive from the coat of arms of Middlesex, its county. The greyhound is from the heraldry of Mr H. Scott Freeman, who was Clerk of the Council from 1901 until 1946, and bore the cost of the grant. Ad Pontes, part of the motto, was the Roman name for Staines. Successor In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the urban district was abolished and its former area was combined with that of Sunbury-on-Thames Urban District to form the present-day borough of Spelthorne.

It was released in Japan in 2002 by Irem, and in North America and Europe in 2003, localized by Agetec.https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_sos_ps2 It is the first game in the Disaster Report series. The game deals with the characters' survival and escape from the slow collapse of an artificial island. While dodging falling buildings and debris from periodic earthquakes, the player must find a way off the island. In addition, the main character, a reporter, must investigate the reasons for the disaster.https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/disaster- report-ps2/ Gameplay HP is the character's health and QP is the amount of energy the character has left. QP can be restored by drinking water. If the character becomes thirsty from running or other strenuous tasks, the player must provide the character with drinking water. If the player does not do this, the character begins to slowly lose health.https://uk.ign.com/articles/2003/02/20/disaster-report Water can be drunk from clean taps or from bottled water filled up along the way. It is possible to give the character's companion water. Ultimately, the aim of the game is to move through the city avoiding hazards and finding new routes through seemingly impassable hazards. When an aftershock strikes, the player must make Keith crouch, to keep him stable and safe from harm. Customisation of equipment can help Keith, or in the case of certain accessories, change his appearance. Items are stored in the players backpack, which has a limited number of slots, but larger backpacks can be collected. Friendly characters are unarmed. Keith is accompanied by various companions.https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/18/17586458/disaster-report- earthquake-game-irem-playstation-2-classics At one point, Keith has choice of companion, Karen or Kelly, both with different areas to explore and storylines to uncover. There are seven possible endings to the game.https://uk.ign.com/articles/2003/02/20/disaster-report?page=3 The Japanese version is one of the few games to support the Rez Vibrator. Plot The year is 2001. After ten years of construction, the government announces to the world the completion of a top-secret project based in the Pacific Ocean, known as Stiver Island (Capital Island in the Japanese version). In a feat of revolutionary technology, the government used its top engineering talent to transform a minor spur of rock that barely stood above the ocean waves into a thriving man-made island, complete with a state-of-the-art metropolis called Capital City. In June 2005, Keith Helm (Masayuki Sud≈ç), the protagonist and player character is on his way to Capital City for the first time, to start his dream job as an editor for the prestigious Town Crier newspaper. Upon his arrival, an earthquake occurs. Soon after regaining consciousness, he comes across another survivor, Karen Morris (Mari Aizawa). They travel together as strong aftershocks continue until they meet a man named Greg Bach (K≈çji Jin'nai). Further on, the group decides to split up. Keith (the player) can either go with Karen to find her dog or go with Greg to help a girl named Kelly Austin (Natsumi Higa) find her brother Jason (Haruhiko). No matter whether the player accompanies Karen or Greg, Keith ends up at the Town Crier building. He meets William (Hideaki Nishiyama), who directs him to the construction company that built the island. There it is revealed that the disaster was deliberate. After escaping the building Keith can either help a wounded William evacuate or leave him and Karen/Kelly so he can escape. William is evacuated and Keith goes to a stadium, where the player can switch which girl they are escorting. Keith and Kelly/Karen are chased into an abandoned mall by the construction company's goons. After escaping they meet up with Greg, Kelly/Karen is evacuated, and they meet the man who oversaw Stiver Island's Construction - Terry Stiver (Yoshitaka Shinzaki). Terry tells them that he caused the quake to get revenge on the government because his family was killed in a landslide. Keith reveals to the man that his business partner Albert (Takumi Hatta) caused the landslide to make him want to destroy the island. After escaping from an attack chopper in a river chase, they are again confronted when their makeshift boat lands on the Capital District. At this point, a mini-tsunami occurs, forcing them into a car showroom and up through it onto the roof. Upon reaching the top the trio sees the chopper once again, which drops two enemies onto the building. While risking his life to save Karen/Kelly, Greg is shot by an enemy, after which the building \\"sinks\\" and the enemy is killed. Greg dies after asking Keith to write an expos√© on the government's misdeeds in constructing the island. Keith and Karen/Kelly then make their way into another skyscraper. Terry dies with Albert and depending on the player's relationship with Karen/Kelly, either ends with the two escaping, or them holding each other as the water rises towards them. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 32 out of 40. =Sequels= A sequel, Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 2: Itetsuita Kiokutachi, was released in Japan on March 30, 2006, and later released in America and Europe as Raw Danger!. A second sequel, Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 3: Kowareyuku Machi to Kanojo no Uta, was released for the PSP on April 23, 2009. This game was not released outside Japan. A fourth game, Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4: Summer Memories, was scheduled for release on PlayStation 3 in April 2011, with 3D and Move support. However, the game was cancelled after the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake. In December 2014 the creator of the Disaster Report series - Kazuma Kujo - bought the IP of the series from Irem for his company Granzella. Subsequently, Granzella re-released the existing Disaster Report games for download in Japan. The original game and the sequel \\"Raw Danger\\" were re- released on PlayStation 2 and Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 3 for the PSP. Development for the fourth game was resumed and Granzella released 3 new teaser pictures and announced to release detailed information around autumn 2015. It was eventually released for PlayStation 4 as Disaster Report 4 Plus: Summer Memories in 2018, with a Nintendo Switch port released in 2020.

Cluett was born in Belleoram, Newfoundland, and during the war served in the Volunteer Aid Detachment in Europe. Cluett's two dozen letters give a detailed account of her departure from St. John's, travels to New York City, London, France, and Constantinople, and of her amazement at the horrors of the front line. These letters are currently housed in the Centre for Newfoundland Studies at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, and are in the process being published to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the battle at Beaumont Hamel in which so many Newfoundland men lost their lives. Cluett wrote of her time spent attending countless soldiers at the 10th General Hospital in Rouen, France.

It is led by a group of six student sabbatical officers known as the Student Executive, and supported by over 150 full-time staff members, 500 student members of staff, and hundreds of dedicated volunteers. The organisation's aim is the advancement of education of Leeds students, by representing, supporting and advising students to improve their welfare and promote their interests and through the provision of social activities. It was the first Students' Union in the country to be re- verified as 'Excellent' in the NUS Quality Students' Union accreditation in 2019. History The current Union has its roots in the various societies of the Yorkshire College, a college which joined the federal Victoria University in 1887. The Yorkshire College Students Association was the first such society, founded in 1877. In 1890, a single consolidated body was formed to manage and fund the various societies. Rooms and areas within University buildings, which at the time consisted mainly of converted townhouses, were used as common rooms and meeting spaces until 1937 when work began on the current University Union building. Completed in 1939, it was made possible by a large financial donation from W Riley-Smith of Tadcaster. The building was extended in the 1960s as part of the Chamberlin, Powell and Bon development plan for the University campus, and again in the late 1990s. The representative function of the Union developed later, with no reference to the representation of the student body being included in the University's initial charter in 1904. From 1944, presidents and vice-presidents of the Union were made members of the University Council, to represent student opinion and inform students of the operations of the Council. Facilities The outside of the Leeds University Union building in 2014 The Union houses a variety of services, which work towards its aim of representing, supporting and advising students. These services are funded partly by a grant from the University and partly through income from the Union's commercial operations, which consist of a number of retail outlets, bars and nightclubs within the building. As a not- for-profit charity, all money it earns goes back into making what it refers to as 'a better Union'. =Services= The Union's Help & Support department (previously Student Advice and Student Advice Centre) provides specialist advice on housing, money and academic matters to students and can offer general advice and pointers in other areas. Student Advice also provides advocacy services for academic appeals and works with the University to maintain resources such as Help@Leeds. They also have a team of student Health and Wellbeing Ambassadors, who run events on campus and host a fortnightly wellbeing podcast on Soundcloud. Clubs and societies are supported by the Union's Student Activities team, which manages over 300 clubs and societies. Student Activities also manages the Union's Give It A Go programme and administers the allocation of grant funding to societies. Societies range in topic and include the likes of RAG and Nightline as well as student media groups such as Leeds Student, Leeds Student Radio and Leeds Student Television. Joblink is an employment agency, which any registered student can access and use. The service lists both permanent jobs and temporary work deemed suitable for students, and also runs workshops aimed at improving employability. The Union's Volunteering and Community department lists volunteer roles which can also help improve students' employment prospects and community cohesion. The Union also operates a Minibus Safety Service, called the Nightbus which takes students home from the Union at a charge of only ¬£1. They are also proud to have a partnership with local taxi provider Amber Cars. As part of this partnership, Amber Cars' drivers are obliged to take students home safely even if they don't have any money on them. =Retail= The Union operates four retail outlets within its building: * LUU Co-op, a franchise of The Co-operative Group (opened April 2019) * Salad Box, a salad bar (opened April 2013) * Union Shop, a shop selling stationery, cards, gifts and art supplies (opened August 2019) * Gear, a clothing and gift shop selling University of Leeds branded merchandise. A number of other retail units are let to external companies, including Humpit, Bayfields Opticians and Wok&Go.; =Bars and Venues= Blue plaque commemorating the recording of Live at Leeds by The Who The building is home to two bars (Old Bar and Terrace), two coffee shops (Common Ground (formerly Hidden Cafe) and Balcony) and a salad bar, Salad Box, which are all open during the day serving a variety of food and drinks. The bars are also open every night, and host regular events such as karaoke nights and pub quizzes. Much-loved by students, Old Bar specialises in local and real ale, and is a Black Sheep Brewery Flagship bar and Cask Marque accredited. Three nightclubs are present on the site, the largest of which is Stylus' which was opened in the early 2000s. Alongside this are two smaller clubs, Pyramid (formerly Mine) and Function (formerly Pulse, formerly Bar Coda). During club nights, these venues are opened in various combinations depending on the expected audience - for instance, all three are opened for the weekly club night Fruity, while fewer rooms are open for external clubnights Club Tropicana and Brouhaha. The clubs are also used as concert venues, with the University's adjoining refectory used for larger events. These include The Who (who recorded Live at Leeds there originally in 1970, and returned in June 2006 to recreate the original show - the concert booklet for which listed the gig history of the venue), Bob Marley and the Wailers (as heard on the remastered 2004 Deluxe edition of Burnin ), Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and more recently Ed Sheeran, Bastille, Muse (recorded and played on MTV), The Strokes, Bloc Party, Manic Street Preachers, KT Tunstall, Arctic Monkeys, Pendulum, The Coral, Paul Weller and The Rolling Stones.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-rolling-stones-on-tour- goodbye-great-britain-19710415 =Other spaces= The Riley Smith Theatre (formerly Riley Smith Hall), refurbished in 2005 and 2016, is the largest proscenium theatre on the University campus and is used by student societies for performances, as well as being the main venue of the Backstage Society who provide technical and stage management services; also the venue for Live at Leeds, the John Martyn album, recorded in 1975. Pyramid Theatre (formerly Raven Theatre) is a theatre in the round located underground to the rear of the building, built in the 1960s as a debating chamber. Media Leeds Student logo, the 2009 Guardian Student Newspaper of the Year LUU has one of the country's most active university newspapers, The Gryphon (formerly Leeds Student until its renaming to its original name of \\"The Gryphon\\" in 2014). It is published weekly, on Fridays, during term time. Leeds Student was formed by the merger of the Leeds University Union newspaper (Union News) and the Leeds Metropolitan University Students Union newspaper, but in November 2005 the Leeds Met students voted to disaffiliate from Leeds Student citing under- representation as the reason. The GIST has currently been relaunched as a mini magazine intended to keep members informed by highlighting and featuring events taking place in the union. Old paper based publications include The Document and the Lippy magazine, which was the Union's Women's Magazine run by students. LUU has a student radio station, Leeds Student Radio. The station is widely active in LUU and often provides live DJs for union events, such as every Thursday in the Terrace and every Friday in Old Bar. Leeds Student Radio has a dedicated committee of around 20 members, and is one of the largest student stations in the country, boasting over 300 members. Many of its members have gone on to careers in radio and television. There is also an internal TV station, LSTV, which broadcasts online and on televisions located around the Union building including in the Terrace and the Old Bar. LSTV broadcast live every Wednesday during term-time from their studio within the building itself. LSTV have been successful in winning awards through the student TV association NaSTA winning 9 awards in 2010 including best broadcaster. Jack Straw Jack Straw, former Foreign Secretary, was famously President of Leeds University Union in 1967‚Äì68. Whilst President, Straw played a role in taking over the leadership of a student sit-in (which he had initially opposed) in June 1968. In 2000, a motion was passed at the LUU Annual General Meeting strongly criticising Straw, then Home Secretary, for his part in the Asylum and Immigration Bill, the attempted removal of trial by jury (for some defendants) and legal aid in many cases, the anti-terrorism bill, the curfew on teenagers, mandatory drug testing for criminal suspects, and his attitude towards cannabis and tuition fees. Simon Rothstein, who proposed the motion, noted that the organisations that have condemned Straw included the Bar Council. He also pointed out that Mrs Thatcher had said, \\"I trust Jack Straw. He is a very fair man.\\" The motion revoked Jack Straw's life membership of the union, banned him from the union building and called on the university to withdraw Straw's honorary degree. In September 2007, the Communications and Internal Affairs Officer, Neil Mackenzie, put forward a motion to reinstate Jack Straw's name on the Presidents' Board in Old Bar, but this fell at Union Council. In November 2007, a motion was put to a referendum of the entire student body over whether to reinstate Jack Straw's membership of the union and have his name returned to the Presidents' Board. The motion passed by 1,175 votes to 423, meaning Jack Straw's life membership will soon be reinstated and his name returned to the board of former Presidents. Union Upgrade (2015) On 3 February 2015, Leeds University Union revealed a ¬£20 million project to significantly update the Union building. Following successful University approval construction began in early 2016. The project was developed after several rounds of student feedback and consultation with significant upgrades to the Foyer, bars and venues, prayer spaces and meeting rooms, along with the brand-new Union Square and South Entrance planned. The upgrade was fully opened in September 2017. They also revealed a major digital transformation, introducing a brand refresh and a dramatically revamped and notably user-first website.

Double integral as volume under a surface . The rectangular region at the bottom of the body is the domain of integration, while the surface is the graph of the two-variable function to be integrated. The multiple integral is a definite integral of a function of more than one real variable, for instance, or . Integrals of a function of two variables over a region in are called double integrals, and integrals of a function of three variables over a region of are called triple integrals. For multiple integrals of a single-variable function, see the Cauchy formula for repeated integration. Introduction Just as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable represents the area of the region between the graph of the function and the -axis, the double integral of a positive function of two variables represents the volume of the region between the surface defined by the function (on the three-dimensional Cartesian plane where and the plane which contains its domain. If there are more variables, a multiple integral will yield hypervolumes of multidimensional functions. Multiple integration of a function in variables: over a domain is most commonly represented by nested integral signs in the reverse order of execution (the leftmost integral sign is computed last), followed by the function and integrand arguments in proper order (the integral with respect to the rightmost argument is computed last). The domain of integration is either represented symbolically for every argument over each integral sign, or is abbreviated by a variable at the rightmost integral sign: : \\\\int \\\\cdots \\\\int_\\\\mathbf{D}\\\\, f(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\,dx_1 \\\\\\\\!\\\\cdots dx_n Since the concept of an antiderivative is only defined for functions of a single real variable, the usual definition of the indefinite integral does not immediately extend to the multiple integral. Mathematical definition For , consider a so-called \\"half-open\\" -dimensional hyperrectangular domain , defined as: :T= [ a_1, b_1) \\\\times [ a_2, b_2) \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times [ a_n, b_n) \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbf{R}^n. Partition each interval into a finite family of non-overlapping subintervals , with each subinterval closed at the left end, and open at the right end. Then the finite family of subrectangles given by :C=I_1\\\\times I_2\\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times I_n is a partition of ; that is, the subrectangles are non-overlapping and their union is . Let be a function defined on . Consider a partition of as defined above, such that is a family of subrectangles and :T=C_1\\\\cup C_2\\\\cup \\\\cdots \\\\cup C_m We can approximate the total th-dimensional volume bounded below by the -dimensional hyperrectangle and above by the -dimensional graph of with the following Riemann sum: :\\\\sum_{k=1}^m f(P_k)\\\\, \\\\operatorname{m}(C_k) where is a point in and is the product of the lengths of the intervals whose Cartesian product is , also known as the measure of . The diameter of a subrectangle is the largest of the lengths of the intervals whose Cartesian product is . The diameter of a given partition of is defined as the largest of the diameters of the subrectangles in the partition. Intuitively, as the diameter of the partition is restricted smaller and smaller, the number of subrectangles gets larger, and the measure of each subrectangle grows smaller. The function is said to be Riemann integrable if the limit :S=\\\\lim_{\\\\delta \\\\to 0} \\\\sum_{k=1}^m f(P_k)\\\\, \\\\operatorname{m}\\\\, (C_k) exists, where the limit is taken over all possible partitions of of diameter at most . If is Riemann integrable, is called the Riemann integral of over and is denoted : \\\\int \\\\cdots \\\\int_T\\\\, f(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\,dx_1 \\\\\\\\!\\\\cdots dx_n Frequently this notation is abbreviated as : \\\\int_T\\\\\\\\!f(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\,d^n\\\\mathbf{x}. where represents the -tuple and is the -dimensional volume differential. The Riemann integral of a function defined over an arbitrary bounded -dimensional set can be defined by extending that function to a function defined over a half-open rectangle whose values are zero outside the domain of the original function. Then the integral of the original function over the original domain is defined to be the integral of the extended function over its rectangular domain, if it exists. In what follows the Riemann integral in dimensions will be called the multiple integral. =Properties= Multiple integrals have many properties common to those of integrals of functions of one variable (linearity, commutativity, monotonicity, and so on). One important property of multiple integrals is that the value of an integral is independent of the order of integrands under certain conditions. This property is popularly known as Fubini's theorem. =Particular cases= In the case of , the integral : l = \\\\iint_T f(x,y)\\\\, dx\\\\, dy is the double integral of on , and if the integral : l = \\\\iiint_T f(x,y,z)\\\\, dx\\\\, dy\\\\, dz is the triple integral of on . Notice that, by convention, the double integral has two integral signs, and the triple integral has three; this is a notational convention which is convenient when computing a multiple integral as an iterated integral, as shown later in this article. Methods of integration The resolution of problems with multiple integrals consists, in most cases, of finding a way to reduce the multiple integral to an iterated integral, a series of integrals of one variable, each being directly solvable. For continuous functions, this is justified by Fubini's theorem. Sometimes, it is possible to obtain the result of the integration by direct examination without any calculations. The following are some simple methods of integration: =Integrating constant functions= When the integrand is a constant function , the integral is equal to the product of and the measure of the domain of integration. If and the domain is a subregion of , the integral gives the area of the region, while if the domain is a subregion of , the integral gives the volume of the region. > Example. Let and :D = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (x,y) \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^2 \\\\ : \\\\ 2 \\\\le x \\\\le 4 \\\\ > ; \\\\ 3 \\\\le y \\\\le 6 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} in which case :\\\\int_3^6 \\\\int_2^4 \\\\ 2 \\\\ dx\\\\, dy > =2\\\\int_3^6 \\\\int_2^4 \\\\ 1 \\\\ dx\\\\, dy= 2\\\\cdot\\\\operatorname{area}(D) = 2 \\\\cdot (2 > \\\\cdot 3) = 12, since by definition we have: :\\\\int_3^6 \\\\int_2^4 \\\\ 1 \\\\ dx\\\\, > dy=\\\\operatorname{area}(D). =Use of symmetry= When the domain of integration is symmetric about the origin with respect to at least one of the variables of integration and the integrand is odd with respect to this variable, the integral is equal to zero, as the integrals over the two halves of the domain have the same absolute value but opposite signs. When the integrand is even with respect to this variable, the integral is equal to twice the integral over one half of the domain, as the integrals over the two halves of the domain are equal. > Example 1. Consider the function integrated over the domain :T=\\\\left \\\\\\\\{ ( > x,y) \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^2 \\\\ : \\\\ x^2+y^2\\\\le 1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, a disc with radius 1 > centered at the origin with the boundary included. Using the linearity > property, the integral can be decomposed into three pieces: :\\\\iint_T > \\\\left(2\\\\sin x - 3y^3 + 5\\\\right) \\\\, dx \\\\, dy = \\\\iint_T 2 \\\\sin x \\\\, dx \\\\, dy - > \\\\iint_T 3y^3 \\\\, dx \\\\, dy + \\\\iint_T 5 \\\\, dx \\\\, dy The function is an odd > function in the variable and the disc is symmetric with respect to the > -axis, so the value of the first integral is 0. Similarly, the function is > an odd function of , and is symmetric with respect to the -axis, and so the > only contribution to the final result is that of the third integral. > Therefore the original integral is equal to the area of the disk times 5, or > 5. > Example 2. Consider the function and as integration region the ball with > radius 2 centered at the origin, :T = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ ( x,y, z) \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^3 \\\\ > : \\\\ x^2+y^2+z^2 \\\\le 4 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. The \\"ball\\" is symmetric about all three > axes, but it is sufficient to integrate with respect to -axis to show that > the integral is 0, because the function is an odd function of that variable. =Normal domains on = This method is applicable to any domain for which: * the projection of onto either the -axis or the -axis is bounded by the two values, and * any line perpendicular to this axis that passes between these two values intersects the domain in an interval whose endpoints are given by the graphs of two functions, and . Such a domain will be here called a normal domain. Elsewhere in the literature, normal domains are sometimes called type I or type II domains, depending on which axis the domain is fibred over. In all cases, the function to be integrated must be Riemann integrable on the domain, which is true (for instance) if the function is continuous. -axis If the domain is normal with respect to the -axis, and is a continuous function; then and (both of which are defined on the interval ) are the two functions that determine . Then, by Fubini's theorem: :\\\\iint_D f(x,y)\\\\, dx\\\\, dy = \\\\int_a^b dx \\\\int_{ \\\\alpha (x)}^{ \\\\beta (x)} f(x,y)\\\\, dy. -axis If is normal with respect to the -axis and is a continuous function; then and (both of which are defined on the interval ) are the two functions that determine . Again, by Fubini's theorem: :\\\\iint_D f(x,y)\\\\, dx\\\\, dy = \\\\int_a^b dy \\\\int_{\\\\alpha (y)}^{ \\\\beta (y)} f(x,y)\\\\, dx. Normal domains on  If is a domain that is normal with respect to the -plane and determined by the functions and , then :\\\\iiint_T f(x,y,z) \\\\, dx\\\\, dy\\\\, dz = \\\\iint_D \\\\int_{\\\\alpha (x,y)}^{\\\\beta (x,y)} f(x,y,z) \\\\, dz\\\\, dx\\\\, dy This definition is the same for the other five normality cases on . It can be generalized in a straightforward way to domains in . =Change of variables= The limits of integration are often not easily interchangeable (without normality or with complex formulae to integrate). One makes a change of variables to rewrite the integral in a more \\"comfortable\\" region, which can be described in simpler formulae. To do so, the function must be adapted to the new coordinates. > Example 1a. The function is ; if one adopts the substitution , therefore , > one obtains the new function . * Similarly for the domain because it is delimited by the original variables that were transformed before ( and in example). * the differentials and transform via the absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix containing the partial derivatives of the transformations regarding the new variable (consider, as an example, the differential transformation in polar coordinates). There exist three main \\"kinds\\" of changes of variable (one in , two in ); however, more general substitutions can be made using the same principle. Polar coordinates Transformation from cartesian to polar coordinates. In if the domain has a circular symmetry and the function has some particular characteristics one can apply the transformation to polar coordinates (see the example in the picture) which means that the generic points in Cartesian coordinates switch to their respective points in polar coordinates. That allows one to change the shape of the domain and simplify the operations. The fundamental relation to make the transformation is the following: :f(x,y) \\\\rightarrow f(\\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\varphi,\\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\varphi ). > Example 2a. The function is and applying the transformation one obtains > :f(\\\\rho, \\\\varphi) = \\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\varphi + \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\varphi = \\\\rho(\\\\cos > \\\\varphi + \\\\sin \\\\varphi ). > Example 2b. The function is , in this case one has: :f(\\\\rho, \\\\varphi) = > \\\\rho^2 \\\\left(\\\\cos^2 \\\\varphi + \\\\sin^2 \\\\varphi\\\\right) = \\\\rho^2 using the > Pythagorean trigonometric identity (very useful to simplify this operation). The transformation of the domain is made by defining the radius' crown length and the amplitude of the described angle to define the intervals starting from . Example of a domain transformation from cartesian to polar. > Example 2c. The domain is , that is a circumference of radius 2; it's > evident that the covered angle is the circle angle, so varies from 0 to 2, > while the crown radius varies from 0 to 2 (the crown with the inside radius > null is just a circle). > Example 2d. The domain is , that is the circular crown in the positive half- > plane (please see the picture in the example); describes a plane angle while > varies from 2 to 3. Therefore the transformed domain will be the following > rectangle: :T = \\\\\\\\{ 2 \\\\le \\\\rho \\\\le 3, \\\\ 0 \\\\le \\\\varphi \\\\le \\\\pi \\\\\\\\}. The > Jacobian determinant of that transformation is the following: > :\\\\frac{\\\\partial (x,y)}{\\\\partial (\\\\rho, \\\\varphi)} = \\\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\cos > \\\\varphi & \\\\- \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\varphi  \\\\sin \\\\varphi & \\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\varphi > \\\\end{vmatrix} = \\\\rho which has been obtained by inserting the partial > derivatives of , in the first column respect to and in the second respect to > , so the differentials in this transformation become . Once the function is > transformed and the domain evaluated, it is possible to define the formula > for the change of variables in polar coordinates: :\\\\iint_D f(x,y) \\\\, dx\\\\, dy > = \\\\iint_T f(\\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\varphi, \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\varphi) \\\\rho \\\\, d \\\\rho\\\\, d > \\\\varphi. is valid in the interval while , which is a measure of a length, > can only have positive values. > Example 2e. The function is and the domain is the same as in Example 2d. > From the previous analysis of we know the intervals of (from 2 to 3) and of > (from 0 to ). Now we change the function: :f(x,y) = x \\\\longrightarrow > f(\\\\rho,\\\\varphi) = \\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\varphi. finally let's apply the integration > formula: :\\\\iint_D x \\\\, dx\\\\, dy = \\\\iint_T \\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\varphi \\\\rho \\\\, d\\\\rho\\\\, > d\\\\varphi. Once the intervals are known, you have :\\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\int_2^3 \\\\rho^2 > \\\\cos \\\\varphi \\\\, d \\\\rho \\\\, d \\\\varphi = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\cos \\\\varphi \\\\ d \\\\varphi > \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\rho^3}{3} \\\\right]_2^3 = \\\\Big[ \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\Big]_0^\\\\pi \\\\ > \\\\left(9 - \\\\frac{8}{3} \\\\right) = 0. Cylindrical coordinates Cylindrical coordinates. In the integration on domains with a circular base can be made by the passage to cylindrical coordinates; the transformation of the function is made by the following relation: :f(x,y,z) \\\\rightarrow f(\\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\varphi, \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\varphi, z) The domain transformation can be graphically attained, because only the shape of the base varies, while the height follows the shape of the starting region. > Example 3a. The region is (that is the \\"tube\\" whose base is the circular > crown of Example 2d and whose height is 5); if the transformation is > applied, this region is obtained: :T = \\\\\\\\{ 2 \\\\le \\\\rho \\\\le 3, \\\\ 0 \\\\le \\\\varphi > \\\\le 2 \\\\pi, \\\\ 0 \\\\le z \\\\le 5 \\\\\\\\} (that is, the parallelepiped whose base is > similar to the rectangle in Example 2d and whose height is 5). Because the > component is unvaried during the transformation, the differentials vary as > in the passage to polar coordinates: therefore, they become . Finally, it is > possible to apply the final formula to cylindrical coordinates: :\\\\iiint_D > f(x,y,z) \\\\, dx\\\\, dy\\\\, dz = \\\\iiint_T f(\\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\varphi, \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\varphi, > z) \\\\rho \\\\, d\\\\rho\\\\, d\\\\varphi\\\\, dz. This method is convenient in case of > cylindrical or conical domains or in regions where it is easy to individuate > the z interval and even transform the circular base and the function. > Example 3b. The function is and as integration domain this cylinder: . The > transformation of in cylindrical coordinates is the following: :T = \\\\\\\\{ 0 > \\\\le \\\\rho \\\\le 3, \\\\ 0 \\\\le \\\\varphi \\\\le 2 \\\\pi, \\\\ -5 \\\\le z \\\\le 5 \\\\\\\\}. while the > function becomes :f(\\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\varphi, \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\varphi, z) = \\\\rho^2 + z > Finally one can apply the integration formula: :\\\\iiint_D \\\\left(x^2 + y^2 > +z\\\\right) \\\\, dx\\\\, dy\\\\, dz = \\\\iiint_T \\\\left( \\\\rho^2 + z\\\\right) \\\\rho \\\\, > d\\\\rho\\\\, d\\\\varphi\\\\, dz; developing the formula you have :\\\\int_{-5}^5 dz > \\\\int_0^{2 \\\\pi} d\\\\varphi \\\\int_0^3 \\\\left( \\\\rho^3 + \\\\rho z \\\\right)\\\\, d\\\\rho = 2 > \\\\pi \\\\int_{-5}^5 \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\rho^4}{4} + \\\\frac{\\\\rho^2 z}{2} \\\\right]_0^3 \\\\, > dz = 2 \\\\pi \\\\int_{-5}^5 \\\\left( \\\\frac{81}{4} + \\\\frac{9}{2} z\\\\right)\\\\, dz = > \\\\cdots = 405 \\\\pi. Spherical coordinates Spherical coordinates. In some domains have a spherical symmetry, so it's possible to specify the coordinates of every point of the integration region by two angles and one distance. It's possible to use therefore the passage to spherical coordinates; the function is transformed by this relation: :f(x,y,z) \\\\longrightarrow f(\\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\varphi, \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\varphi, \\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\varphi) Points on the -axis do not have a precise characterization in spherical coordinates, so can vary between 0 and 2. The better integration domain for this passage is the sphere. > Example 4a. The domain is (sphere with radius 4 and center at the origin); > applying the transformation you get the region :T = \\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\le \\\\rho \\\\le 4, \\\\ > 0 \\\\le \\\\varphi \\\\le \\\\pi, \\\\ 0 \\\\le \\\\theta \\\\le 2 \\\\pi \\\\\\\\}. The Jacobian > determinant of this transformation is the following: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial > (x,y,z)}{\\\\partial (\\\\rho, \\\\theta, \\\\varphi)} = \\\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\cos \\\\theta > \\\\sin \\\\varphi & \\\\- \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\varphi & \\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\cos > \\\\varphi  \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\varphi & \\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\varphi & \\\\rho > \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\cos \\\\varphi  \\\\cos \\\\varphi & 0 & \\\\- \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\varphi > \\\\end{vmatrix} = \\\\rho^2 \\\\sin \\\\varphi The differentials therefore are > transformed to . This yields the final integration formula: :\\\\iiint_D > f(x,y,z) \\\\, dx\\\\, dy\\\\, dz = \\\\iiint_T f(\\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\cos \\\\theta, \\\\rho > \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\sin \\\\theta, \\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\varphi) \\\\rho^2 \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\, d\\\\rho\\\\, > d\\\\theta\\\\, d\\\\varphi. It is better to use this method in case of spherical domains and in case of functions that can be easily simplified by the first fundamental relation of trigonometry extended to (see Example 4b); in other cases it can be better to use cylindrical coordinates (see Example 4c). :\\\\iiint_T f(a,b,c) \\\\rho^2 \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\, d\\\\rho\\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\, d\\\\varphi. The extra and come from the Jacobian. In the following examples the roles of and have been reversed. > Example 4b. is the same region as in Example 4a and is the function to > integrate. Its transformation is very easy: :f(\\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\cos > \\\\theta, \\\\rho \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\sin \\\\theta, \\\\rho \\\\cos \\\\varphi) = \\\\rho^2, while we > know the intervals of the transformed region from : :T=\\\\\\\\{0 \\\\le \\\\rho \\\\le 4, > \\\\ 0 \\\\le \\\\varphi \\\\le \\\\pi, \\\\ 0 \\\\le \\\\theta \\\\le 2 \\\\pi\\\\\\\\}. We therefore apply the > integration formula: :\\\\iiint_D \\\\left(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\\\right) \\\\, dx\\\\, dy\\\\, dz > = \\\\iiint_T \\\\rho^2 \\\\, \\\\rho^2 \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\rho\\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\, d\\\\varphi, and, > developing, we get :\\\\iiint_T \\\\rho^4 \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\rho\\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\, > d\\\\varphi = \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi} \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\,d\\\\varphi \\\\int_0^4 \\\\rho^4 d \\\\rho > \\\\int_0^{2 \\\\pi} d\\\\theta = 2 \\\\pi \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi} \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\left[ > \\\\frac{\\\\rho^5}{5} \\\\right]_0^4 \\\\, d \\\\varphi = 2 \\\\pi \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\rho^5}{5} > \\\\right]_0^4 \\\\Big[- \\\\cos \\\\varphi \\\\Big]_0^{\\\\pi} = \\\\frac{4096 \\\\pi}{5}. > Example 4c. The domain is the ball with center at the origin and radius , :D > = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\\\le 9a^2 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} and is the function to > integrate.

Examples Double integral over a rectangle = Let us assume that we wish to integrate a multivariable function over a region : :A = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ (x,y) \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^2 \\\\ : \\\\ 11 \\\\le x \\\\le 14 \\\\ ; \\\\ 7 \\\\le y \\\\le 10 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} \\\\mbox{ and } f(x,y) = x^2 + 4y\\\\, From this we formulate the iterated integral :\\\\int_7^{10} \\\\int_{11}^{14} (x^2 + 4y) \\\\, dx\\\\, dy The inner integral is performed first, integrating with respect to and taking as a constant, as it is not the variable of integration. The result of this integral, which is a function depending only on , is then integrated with respect to . :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_{11}^{14} \\\\left(x^2 + 4y\\\\right) \\\\, dx & = \\\\left [\\\\frac13 x^3 + 4yx \\\\right]_{x=11}^{x=14}  &= \\\\frac13(14)^3 + 4y(14) - \\\\frac13(11)^3 - 4y(11)  &= 471 + 12y \\\\end{align} We then integrate the result with respect to . :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_7^{10} (471 + 12y) \\\\ dy & = \\\\Big[471y + 6y^2\\\\Big]_{y=7}^{y=10}  &= 471(10)+ 6(10)^2 - 471(7) - 6(7)^2  &= 1719 \\\\end{align} In cases where the double integral of the absolute value of the function is finite, the order of integration is interchangeable, that is, integrating with respect to x first and integrating with respect to y first produce the same result. That is Fubini's theorem. For example, doing the previous calculation with order reversed gives the same result: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int_{11}^{14} \\\\int_{7}^{10} \\\\, \\\\left(x^2 + 4y\\\\right) \\\\, dy\\\\, dx & = \\\\int_{11}^{14} \\\\Big[x^2 y + 2y^2 \\\\Big]_{y=7}^{y=10} \\\\, dx  &= \\\\int_{11}^{14} \\\\, (3x^2 + 102) \\\\, dx  &= \\\\Big[x^3 + 102x \\\\Big]_{x=11}^{x=14}  &= 1719. \\\\end{align} = Double integral over a normal domain = Example: double integral over the normal region D Consider the region (please see the graphic in the example): :D = \\\\\\\\{ (x,y) \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^2 \\\\ : \\\\ x \\\\ge 0, y \\\\le 1, y \\\\ge x^2 \\\\\\\\} Calculate :\\\\iint_D (x+y) \\\\, dx \\\\, dy. This domain is normal with respect to both the x- and y-axes. To apply the formulae it is required to find the functions that determine D and the intervals over which these functions are defined. In this case the two functions are: :\\\\alpha (x) = x^2\\\\text{ and }\\\\beta (x) = 1 while the interval is given by the intersections of the functions with x = 0, so the interval is [a, b] = [0, 1] (normality has been chosen with respect to the x-axis for a better visual understanding). It is now possible to apply the formula: :\\\\iint_D (x+y) \\\\, dx \\\\, dy = \\\\int_0^1 dx \\\\int_{x^2}^1 (x+y) \\\\, dy = \\\\int_0^1 dx \\\\ \\\\left[xy + \\\\frac{y^2}{2} \\\\right]^1_{x^2} (at first the second integral is calculated considering x as a constant). The remaining operations consist of applying the basic techniques of integration: :\\\\int_0^1 \\\\left[xy + \\\\frac{y^2}{2}\\\\right]^1_{x^2} \\\\, dx = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\left(x + \\\\frac{1}{2} - x^3 - \\\\frac{x^4}{2} \\\\right) dx = \\\\cdots = \\\\frac{13}{20}. If we choose normality with respect to the y-axis we could calculate :\\\\int_0^1 dy \\\\int_0^{\\\\sqrt{y}} (x+y) \\\\, dx. and obtain the same value. Example of domain in R3 that is normal with respect to the xy-plane. = Calculating volume = Using the methods previously described, it is possible to calculate the volumes of some common solids. * Cylinder: The volume of a cylinder with height and circular base of radius can be calculated by integrating the constant function over the circular base, using polar coordinates. ::\\\\mathrm{Volume} = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} d \\\\varphi\\\\, \\\\int_0^R h \\\\rho \\\\, d \\\\rho = 2 \\\\pi h \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\rho^2}{2}\\\\right]_0^R = \\\\pi R^2 h This is in agreement with the formula for the volume of a prism ::\\\\mathrm{Volume} = \\\\text{base area} \\\\times \\\\text{height}. * Sphere: The volume of a sphere with radius can be calculated by integrating the constant function 1 over the sphere, using spherical coordinates. ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{Volume} &= \\\\iiint_D f(x,y,z) \\\\, dx\\\\, dy\\\\, dz  &= \\\\iiint_D 1 \\\\, dV  &= \\\\iiint_S \\\\rho^2 \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\, d\\\\rho\\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\, d\\\\varphi  &= \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\, d \\\\theta \\\\int_0^{ \\\\pi } \\\\sin \\\\varphi\\\\, d \\\\varphi \\\\int_0^R \\\\rho^2\\\\, d \\\\rho  &= 2 \\\\pi \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\sin \\\\varphi\\\\, d \\\\varphi \\\\int_0^R \\\\rho^2\\\\, d \\\\rho  &= 2 \\\\pi \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\sin \\\\varphi \\\\frac{R^3}{3 }\\\\, d \\\\varphi  &= \\\\frac23 \\\\pi R^3 \\\\Big[-\\\\cos \\\\varphi\\\\Big]_0^\\\\pi = \\\\frac43 \\\\pi R^3. \\\\end{align} * Tetrahedron (triangular pyramid or 3-simplex): The volume of a tetrahedron with its apex at the origin and edges of length along the -, - and -axes can be calculated by integrating the constant function 1 over the tetrahedron. ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{Volume} &= \\\\int_0^\\\\ell dx \\\\int_0^{\\\\ell-x}\\\\, dy \\\\int_0^{\\\\ell-x-y }\\\\, dz  &= \\\\int_0^\\\\ell dx \\\\int_0^{\\\\ell-x } (\\\\ell - x - y)\\\\, dy  &= \\\\int_0^\\\\ell \\\\left( l^2 - 2 \\\\ell x + x^2 - \\\\frac{(\\\\ell-x)^2 }{2}\\\\right)\\\\, dx  &= \\\\ell^3 - \\\\ell \\\\ell^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\ell^3}{3 } - \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\ell^2 x}{2} - \\\\frac{ \\\\ell x^2}{2} + \\\\frac{x^3}{6 }\\\\right]_0^ \\\\ell  &= \\\\frac{\\\\ell^3}{3} - \\\\frac{\\\\ell^3}{6} = \\\\frac{ \\\\ell^3}{6}\\\\end{align} :This is in agreement with the formula for the volume of a pyramid ::\\\\mathrm{Volume} = \\\\frac13 \\\\times \\\\text{base area} \\\\times \\\\text{height} = \\\\frac13 \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\ell^2}{2} \\\\times \\\\ell = \\\\frac{ \\\\ell^3}{6}. Example of an improper domain. Multiple improper integral In case of unbounded domains or functions not bounded near the boundary of the domain, we have to introduce the double improper integral or the triple improper integral. Multiple integrals and iterated integrals Fubini's theorem states that if :\\\\iint_{A\\\\times B} \\\\leftf(x,y)\\\\right\\\\,d(x,y)<\\\\infty, that is, if the integral is absolutely convergent, then the multiple integral will give the same result as either of the two iterated integrals: :\\\\iint_{A\\\\times B} f(x,y)\\\\,d(x,y)=\\\\int_A\\\\left(\\\\int_B f(x,y)\\\\,dy\\\\right)\\\\,dx=\\\\int_B\\\\left(\\\\int_A f(x,y)\\\\,dx\\\\right)\\\\,dy. In particular this will occur if is a bounded function and and are bounded sets. If the integral is not absolutely convergent, care is needed not to confuse the concepts of multiple integral and iterated integral, especially since the same notation is often used for either concept. The notation :\\\\int_0^1\\\\int_0^1 f(x,y)\\\\,dy\\\\,dx means, in some cases, an iterated integral rather than a true double integral. In an iterated integral, the outer integral :\\\\int_0^1 \\\\cdots \\\\, dx is the integral with respect to of the following function of : :g(x)=\\\\int_0^1 f(x,y)\\\\,dy. A double integral, on the other hand, is defined with respect to area in the -plane. If the double integral exists, then it is equal to each of the two iterated integrals (either \\"\\" or \\"\\") and one often computes it by computing either of the iterated integrals. But sometimes the two iterated integrals exist when the double integral does not, and in some such cases the two iterated integrals are different numbers, i.e., one has :\\\\int_0^1\\\\int_0^1 f(x,y)\\\\,dy\\\\,dx eq \\\\int_0^1\\\\int_0^1 f(x,y)\\\\,dx\\\\,dy. This is an instance of rearrangement of a conditionally convergent integral. On the other hand, some conditions ensure that the two iterated integrals are equal even though the double integral need not exist. By the Fichtenholz‚ÄìLichtenstein theorem, if is bounded on and both iterated integrals exist, then they are equal. Moreover, existence of the inner integrals ensures existence of the outer integrals. The double integral need not exist in this case even as Lebesgue integral, according to Sierpi≈Ñski. The notation :\\\\int_{[0,1]\\\\times[0,1]} f(x,y)\\\\,dx\\\\,dy may be used if one wishes to be emphatic about intending a double integral rather than an iterated integral. Some practical applications Quite generally, just as in one variable, one can use the multiple integral to find the average of a function over a given set. Given a set and an integrable function over , the average value of over its domain is given by :\\\\bar{f} = \\\\frac{1}{m(D)} \\\\int_D f(x)\\\\, dx, where is the measure of . Additionally, multiple integrals are used in many applications in physics. The examples below also show some variations in the notation. In mechanics, the moment of inertia is calculated as the volume integral (triple integral) of the density weighed with the square of the distance from the axis: :I_z = \\\\iiint_V \\\\rho r^2\\\\, dV. The gravitational potential associated with a mass distribution given by a mass measure on three-dimensional Euclidean space is :V(\\\\mathbf{x}) = -\\\\iiint_{\\\\mathbf{R}^3} \\\\frac{G}{\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{y}}\\\\,dm(\\\\mathbf{y}). If there is a continuous function representing the density of the distribution at , so that , where is the Euclidean volume element, then the gravitational potential is :V(\\\\mathbf{x}) = -\\\\iiint_{\\\\mathbf{R}^3} \\\\frac{G}{\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{y}}\\\\,\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{y})\\\\,d^3\\\\mathbf{y}. In electromagnetism, Maxwell's equations can be written using multiple integrals to calculate the total magnetic and electric fields. In the following example, the electric field produced by a distribution of charges given by the volume charge density is obtained by a triple integral of a vector function: :\\\\vec E = \\\\frac {1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\iiint \\\\frac {\\\\vec r - \\\\vec r'}{\\\\left \\\\ \\\\vec r - \\\\vec r' \\\\right \\\\^3} \\\\rho (\\\\vec r')\\\\, d^3 r'. This can also be written as an integral with respect to a signed measure representing the charge distribution.

It was an important forerunner to the Trades Union Congress. The organisation was largely inspired by William Dronfield, who was elected as its Secretary. It initially represented over 200,000 trade unionists, organised through trades councils or national unions. Among the attendees at the first conference were the London Working Men's Association, and George Odger of the London Trades Council. The organisation agreed to secure mutual co-operation during lock-outs, to oppose the Master and Servant Act, and to work for the establishment of Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration. Its headquarters were established in Sheffield, and its executive was elected by the Sheffield Association of Organised Trades. A second conference was held in Manchester in January 1867, and a third in Preston in September of that year, although by this point, it was in sharp decline. The prospects for the organisation were essentially finished by the Sheffield Outrages. Although it condemned them, it soon emerged that William Broadhead, Treasurer of the Association, was their ringleader. The organisation was wound up in 1871.

In the formal sciences, mathematics, mathematical logic, statistics, and their applied disciplines, a Boolean-valued function may also be referred to as a characteristic function, indicator function, predicate, or proposition. In all of these uses, it is understood that the various terms refer to a mathematical object and not the corresponding semiotic sign or syntactic expression. In formal semantic theories of truth, a truth predicate is a predicate on the sentences of a formal language, interpreted for logic, that formalizes the intuitive concept that is normally expressed by saying that a sentence is true. A truth predicate may have additional domains beyond the formal language domain, if that is what is required to determine a final truth value.

In 1335 he was sent west from Kamakura, the capital, at the head of a large army. The goal was to secure the sh≈çgun's control over the region, and prepare for an attack to the west, expanding the Sh≈çgun's power. However, the Imperial Court sent its army, bolstered by warriors from across the country, against the shogunate and against Moroyasu and Moronao in particular. This army, led by Nitta Yoshisada, met Moroyasu's force on 10 December, and they fought again ten days later. After a number of skirmishes, Moroyasu's army, despite being reinforced by men under Ashikaga Tadayoshi, was defeated, and withdrew into the Hakone Mountains. Here, at Sanoyama and Mishima, another set of skirmishes took place, eventually resulting in the destruction of Nitta's Imperial force when the sh≈çgun arrived with further reinforcements. The Taiheiki, an epic dedicated to the events of this period, describes the K≈ç brothers as avid villains. That description is very probably accurate. Both brothers during their careers were extremely useful to Takauji, but because of their violent characters they also made him many powerful enemies. Most importantly, Moronao was bitterly opposed to Takauji's younger brother Tadayoshi and his policies. This enmity would be the main trigger of the Kann≈ç Disturbance, an extremely divisive and damaging civil war between Takauji and Tadayoshi with very serious repercussions for the whole country. Although he ultimately won, Takauji was initially defeated in March 1351 by Tadayoshi and a truce was agreed upon with the help of Zen master Mus≈ç Soseki, who was close to both sides. One of the conditions posed by Tadayoshi was that the K≈ç brothers would retire from politics forever and become monks, which they did. Moronao became a Zen monk and Moroyasu a member of the Nembutsu fraternity. They later left Hy≈çgo for Kyoto accompanied by Takauji, but they would never arrive. The K≈ç were captured and then executed with many dozens of their family at the Muko River by forces led by Uesugi Akiyoshi on 25 March, 1351 (Kann≈ç 2, 27th day of the 2nd month) in revenge for their killing of Akiyoshi's father Shigeyoshi.

The Merlin is fitted with an advanced sensor suite of active/passive sonics, Orange Reaper Electronic Support Measures and Blue Kestrel radar and provides a strong force in under-water warfare and anti- surface unit warfare. The unit's various roles include protecting the Royal Navy against surface and sub-surface threats, command and control, transport, evacuation and Search and Rescue capabilities. 824 Naval Air Squadron is the Merlin Operational Conversion Unit, incorporating the Operational Evaluation Unit flight. The Merlin Training Facility (MTF) is part of 824 NAS, and is a first in that it encompasses pilot, observer, aircrewman and engineering training under one roof. The facility comprises a Cockpit Dynamic Simulator (CDS), 3 Rear Crew Trainers (RCT), 6 Part Task Trainers (PTT), computer-based training (CBT) classrooms, a Mechanical Systems Trainer (MST) and a Weapon Systems Trainer (WST). Merlin Depth Maintenance FacilityHangar W3, home to the Merlin Depth Maintenance Flight. The Merlin Depth Maintenance Facility (MDMF) performs depth maintenance on AW101 Merlin helicopters of the Royal Navy. MDMF is located at RNAS Culdrose, and is a partnership between the UK Ministry of Defence, AgustaWestland, Serco and Lockheed Martin. For UK Merlin helicopters depth maintenance is centred on a 4-year cycle. MDMF is based upon a pulse line system, similar to a production line; each Merlin \\"pulses\\" through 9 phases in turn ‚Äì removal of major components, inspection, structural repair, fault rectification (3 phases), rebuild, systems test and flight test.  Naval Flying Standards Flight (Rotary Wing)  All rotary wing (helicopter) pilots, observers and aircrewmen are assessed annually by NFSF(RW) examiners. This covers all helicopter squadrons at RNAS Yeovilton as well as Culdrose. The assessment consists of a ground exam and a check flight, and may also occur if a squadron has referred them to NFSF(RW).  Engineering Training Section  The Engineering Training Section (ETS) at RNAS Culdrose is a unit of the Air Engineering Department that is dedicated to the instruction of Merlin Mk2, Mk3 and generic air engineering training. The primary task of the ETS is to train sufficient air engineering personnel to enable the front line to achieve operational capability. It comprises approximately 20 personnel including both service and civilian instructors and is headed by a lieutenant who is responsible to Commander of Air Engineering. = Airborne threat simulation = Two Hawk T.1s at RNAS Culdrose in 2013Hawk T1's of 736 Naval Air Squadron provide a maritime aggressor squadron for Royal Navy ships and vessels of other foreign navies, simulating missile attacks and fast jet attacks on warships in the naval exercise areas south and west of Plymouth. The unit is an evolution of the previous Fleet Requirements Aircraft Direction Unit (FRADU) and is supported by the defence contractor SERCO. = Observer training = 750 Naval Air Squadron provides grading and Basic Observer Training for the Fleet Air Arm's observers and operates the Beechcraft Avenger T1. = Unmanned aerial vehicle operations = 700X Naval Air Squadron is the Royal Navy's first squadron of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) using ScanEagle aircraft. In 2014, 700X Naval Air Squadron was one of the smallest naval units with twelve personnel but numbers could double the following year. =Other units= 1700 Naval Air Squadron  1700 Naval Air Squadron provides qualified specialist personnel to man, operate and maintain all Royal Naval controlled systems in all aviation capable platforms in both the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. The unit provides tailored teams, ranging in size and specialisms and can comprise aircraft handlers, aircraft controllers, fire-fighters, military police officers, logistical personnel, engineers, medics and other specialists to allow the continued operation and protection of naval aircraft worldwide. Established in December 2007, the unit was previously known as the Maritime Aviation Support Force (MASF). It was renamed 1700 Naval Air Squadron on 31 October 2017. Motto: Auxilio Ad Alta (Reaching The Heights With Help)  School of Flight Deck Operations  A dummy deck laid out to practise aircraft handling and manoeuvring in a confined space The Royal Naval School of Flight Deck Operations provides professional training for all naval aircraft handlers. The school also trains other Navy personnel and personnel from the RAF and Army who will be involved in operating aircraft at sea. Trainees are trained in activities they will be required to carry out during their career, such as tackling aircraft fires and aircraft deck handling. Equipment used includes; mock-up can be produced and adjusted at the instructors control and the \\"Dummy Deck\\", a full-sized replica of an Invincible class aircraft carrier's deck allowing trainees to practice their roles in realistic environments, experiencing training with live aircraft with reduced risk and danger compared to operating on a real aircraft carrier.School of Flight Deck Operations Motto: Nostris in Manibus Tuti (Safe in our Hands)  Predannack Airfield  RNAS Culdrose has a satellite airfield at Predannack which it uses primarily as a relief landing ground for helicopter pilot training; it also houses a small arms range and aircraft fire fighting facilities.Predannack Airfield  HMS Seahawk Volunteer Band  HMS Seahawk Volunteer Band at the 2016 Royal Navy Volunteer Band Association Festival in Portsmouth The HMS Seahawk Volunteer Band is one of the nine volunteer bands under the Royal Marines Band Service. It performs regularly around Culdrose and Helston, performing a mainly Ceremonial role on events such as the Freedom of Helston Parade. Although mainly a wind band as well as a marching band, it also includes jazz ensembles and a corps of drums. In July 2003, the band was awarded the Bambara Trophy, the recipient of which is considered to be the best band in the Fleet Air Arm. On 7 June 2016 the band performed a dawn fanfare on the King Harry Ferry to honour the official birthday of HM Queen Elizabeth II.https://www.falriver.co.uk/fanfare The list of bandmasters are as follows: *Colour Sergeant Rich Fenwick (?-2004) *Colour Sergeant Paul Nolan (May 2004-2014) *Colour Sergeant Dom O‚ÄôConnor (2014-Present) Former Squadrons based at RNAS Culdrose 700 Naval Air Squadron The squadron was disbanded on 31 March 2008. With two Merlin helicopters, Squadron 700M carried out trial modifications and developed tactics and operational procedure. The Motto was : \\"Experienta Docet\\" ‚Äì \\"Experience Teaches\\" Fleet Requirements Air Direction Unit (FRADU) FRADU was operated by the contractor Serco Defence and Aerospace as part of the RN MAC 2004, using 13 BAE Hawk T1 advanced jet trainer aircraft on lease to the Royal Navy from the RAF and based at RNAS Culdrose. Two of these aircraft were permanently detached to Naval Flying Standards Flight (Fixed Wing) at RNAS Yeovilton where they were flown by RN pilots, but maintained by Serco engineers. With the draw-down of the Sea King force and the return of British forces from Afghanistan, 854 NAS & 857 NAS were merged back into 849 NAS in 2014. 771 Naval Air Squadron 771 was responsible for search and rescue in Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly and the western English Channel, in total an area of approximately . It also administered the Sea Kings on detachment at HMS Gannet. The squadron was stood down on 1 January 2016, decommissioned on 22 March 2016 and was responsible for saving over 15,000 lives on more than 9,000 missions. Between October 2004 and March 2018, 829 Naval Air Squadron provided up to three ship's flights capable of deploying with Type 23 frigates. The squadron decommissioned on 28 March 2018, with the unit's aircraft and personnel becoming part of 814 Naval Air Squadron, creating the largest ever Merlin squadron. 849 Naval Air Squadron disbanded in April 2020. This previously provided the Royal Navy's airborne surveillance and control.

It is the highest point of the Loweswater Fells, an area of low grassy hills with steep sides overlooking the lake of Loweswater. The fell also overlooks the village of Loweswater, from which it can be climbed. An alternative route is from the Cogra Moss reservoir on its western slopes. Because the Loweswater Fells are a separate geographical unit, Blake Fell is a Marilyn. It is located in the Parish of Lamplugh. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Blake Fell and the other Loweswater Fells form the extremity of the northern arm. The Loweswater Fells have been compared to the digits of a hand, radiating out south westward from the \\"palm\\" centred on Loweswater village. From the west these are Burnbank Fell, Blake Fell, Gavel Fell, Hen Comb and Mellbreak, the \\"thumb\\". Blake Fell is the highest hill in this group, the summit area being a long ridge running southwest along the \\"finger\\". This begins above the shore of Loweswater, rising steeply through the mixed forestry of Holme Wood to the craggy height of Loweswater End. Atop the rise is Carling Knott (1,784 ft), the north eastern summit. The ridge then dips slightly, the landscape changing from rock outcrop to grass, before the final ascent to Blake Fell. A transverse ridge now connects northwards to Burnbank Fell, in truth an outlier of Blake Fell, but given separate status by Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. Southward is the narrow grassy col of Fothergill Head, providing a much more tenuous link to Gavel Fell. The western slopes are heavily wooded with conifers and contoured by forest roads. In addition to Carling Knott, Blake Fell has a number of other subsidiary tops. Descending south west from the summit are High Pen (1,558 ft), Low Pen (1,427 ft), Godworth (1,197 ft) and Kelton Fell (1,020 ft). Beyond lie the Croasdale road and the West Cumberland plain. Standing aloof from these tops, but still within Blake Fell's orbit, is Knock Murton (1,467 ft). This is a steep sided fell, forested on the western flank and with sufficient prominence that it is only barely excluded from the list of Marilyns in its own right. Blake Fell also extends a western ridge over the prominent top of Sharp Knott (1,581 ft) and the wooded High Howes (1,027 ft), falling gently to the village of Lamplugh. These tops are recognised in some guidebooks.Bill Birkett, Complete Lakeland Fells, Collins Willow (1994), Drainage from the western slopes flows via Sharp Knott Gill and Fother Gill to Cogra Moss. This is a reservoir sitting in the deep valley between Blake Fell and Knock Murton, a reed rimmed waterbody held back by a substantial dam at the western end. Also known as Arlecdon Reservoir, it has a depth of around 30 feet.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): The waters from this flank of the fell join the River Marron and ultimately the Derwent. The eastern face of Blake Fell flows either to Loweswater or to its outfall, ensuring that all of the drainage eventually runs to the River Derwent. Geology The summit of Blake Fell is representative of the Kirkstile Formation, laminated mudstone and siltstone typical of the Skiddaw fells. The rougher terrain of Carling Knott is an outcropping of the underlying Loweswater Formation, composed of greywacke sandstone turbidities.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Knock Murton and Kelton Fell bear the scars of mining activity, having been the site of extensive haematite workings. Between 1853 and their closure in 1914 these mines produced anything up to 60,000 tons of ore per year. A railway, the Rowrah and Kelton Fell Line, was built up the valley between the two hills, the line of which can still be traced. A further working, the Croasdale Iron Mine, operated to the south of Kelton Fell.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Summit The summit is a grassy dome decorated with a large cairn, the meeting point of paths from the various ridges. Westwards there is no higher ground to interrupt the sea view. To the east is a fine array of hills stretching from Binsey in the north to Grike in the south. The North Western Fells across Crummock Water are particularly fine, although much better seen from Loweswater End. Ascents From Loweswater village a direct line can be taken up Carling Knott, or a more southerly approach made via High Nook Beck. From the west, Lamplugh or Felldyke provide good access, lying at either end of a network of footpaths. These connect to the track alongside Cogra Moss which can be used to gain the high ground via Low Pen. Knock Murton can also be ascended from the head of the reservoir.

The Merseburg charms or Merseburg incantations () are two medieval magic spells, charms or incantations, written in Old High German. They are the only known examples of Germanic pagan belief preserved in the language. They were discovered in 1841 by Georg Waitz, who found them in a theological manuscript from Fulda, written in the 9th century, although there remains some speculation about the date of the charms themselves. The manuscript (Cod. 136 f. 85a) is stored in the library of the cathedral chapter of Merseburg, hence the name. History miscellany with other manuscripts. The Merseburg charms are the only known surviving relics of pre-Christian, pagan poetry in Old High German literature. The charms were recorded in the 10th century by a cleric, possibly in the abbey of Fulda, on a blank page of a liturgical book, which later passed to the library at Merseburg. The charms have thus been transmitted in Caroline minuscule on the flyleaf of a Latin sacramentary. The spells became famous in modern times through the appreciation of Jacob Grimm, who wrote as follows: > :Lying between Leipzig, Halle and Jena, the extensive library of the > Cathedral Chapter of Merseburg has often been visited and made use of by > scholars. All have passed over a codex which, if they chanced to take it up, > appeared to offer only well-known church items, but which now, valued > according to its entire content, offers a treasure such that the most famous > libraries have nothing to compare with it... The spells were published later by Jacob Grimm in On two newly-discovered poems from the German Heathen Period (1842). The manuscript of the Merseburg charms was on display until November 2004 as part of the exhibition \\"Between Cathedral and World - 1000 years of the Chapter of Merseburg,\\" at Merseburg cathedral. They were previously exhibited in 1939. The texts Each charm is divided into two parts: a preamble telling the story of a mythological event; and the actual spell in the form of a magic analogy (just as it was before... so shall it also be now...). In their verse form, the spells are of a transitional type; the lines show not only traditional alliteration but also the end-rhymes introduced in the Christian verse of the 9th century. =First Merseburg Charm= \\"Idise\\" (1905) by Emil Doepler. The first spell is a \\"L√∂sesegen\\" (blessing of release), describing how a number of \\"Idisen\\" freed from their shackles warriors caught during battle. The last two lines contain the magic words \\"Leap forth from the fetters, escape from the foes\\" that are intended to release the warriors. > { - valign=\\"top\\"  Eiris sazun idisi, sazun hera duoder; suma hapt > heptidun, suma heri lezidun, suma clubodun umbi cuoniouuidi: > insprinc haptbandun, inuar uigandun.  Once sat women, They sat here, > then there. Some fastened bonds, Some impeded an army, Some unraveled > fetters: Escape the bonds, flee the enemy!  } =Second Merseburg Charm= \\"Wodan Heals Balder's Horse\\" (1905) by Emil Doepler. Phol is with Wodan when Baldur's horse dislocates its foot while riding through the forest (holza). Wodan intones the incantation: \\"Bone to bone, blood to blood, limb to limb, as if they were mended\\". Figures that can be clearly identified within Continental Germanic mythology are \\"Uu√¥dan\\" (Wodan) and \\"Fr√Æia\\" (Frija). Depictions found on Migration Period Germanic bracteates are often viewed as Wodan (Odin) healing a horse. Comparing Norse mythology, Wodan is well-attested as the cognate of Odin. Frija the cognate of Frigg, also identified with Freyja. Balder is Norse Baldr. Phol is possibly masculine form of Uolla, and, as Grimm suggested, the context makes it clear that it is another name for Balder. Uolla is cognate with Old Norse Fulla, a goddess there also associated with Frigg. Sunna (the personified sun) is in Norse mythology S√≥l. Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested. > { - valign=\\"top\\"  Phol ende uuodan uuorun zi holza. du uuart demo > balderes uolon sin uuoz birenkit. thu biguol en sinthgunt, sunna era > suister; thu biguol en friia, uolla era suister; thu biguol en uuodan, > so he uuola conda: sose benrenki, sose bluotrenki, sose lidirenki: > ben zi bena, bluot zi bluoda, lid zi geliden, sose gelimida sin!  > Phol and Wodan were riding to the woods, and the foot of Balder's foal was > sprained So Sinthgunt, Sunna's sister, conjured it; and Frija, Volla's > sister, conjured it; and Wodan conjured it, as well he could: Like bone- > sprain, so blood-sprain, so joint-sprain: Bone to bone, blood to blood, > joints to joints, so may they be glued.translation from Benjamin W. Fortson, > Indo-European language and culture: an introduction, Wiley-Blackwell, 2004,, > p. 325.  } Parallels The First Merseburg Charm (loosening charm)'s similarity to the anecdote in Bede's Hist. Eccles., IV, 22 () has been noted by Jacob Grimm. In this Christianized example, it is the singing of the mass, rather than the chanting of the charm, that effects the release of a comrade (in this case a brother). The unshackled man is asked \\"whether he had any spells about him, as are spoken of in fabulous stories\\",translation based on L.C. Jane (1903); A. M. Sellar (1907) (wikisource version) which curiously has been translated as \\"loosening rune (about him)\\" () in the Anglo-Saxon translation of Bede, as has been pointed out by Sophus Bugge. Bugge makes this reference in his edition of the Eddaic poem Gr√≥galdr (1867), in an attempt to justify his emending the phrase \\"Leifnir's fire (?)\\" () into \\"loosening charm\\" () in the context of one of the magic charms that Gr√≥a is teaching to her son. But this is an aggressive emendation of the original text, and its validity as well as any suggestion to its ties to the Merseburg charm is subject to skepticism., p.365, footnote. Quote: \\"The existence of the term \\"leysigaldr\\" in Old Norse is seductive, but does not constitute proof of the existence of these outside the realm of fiction, or that it can be applied to the Merseburg charm. \\" Many analogous magic incantations to the Second Merseburg Charm (horse-healing spell) have been noted. Some paralleling is discernible in other Old German spells, but analogues are particularly abundant in folkloric spells from Scandinavian countries (often preserved in so-called \\"black books\\"). Similar charms have been noted in Gaelic, Lettish and FinnishChristiansen, Reidar. 1914. Die finnischen und nordischen Varianten des zweiten Merseburgerspruches. (Folklore Fellows‚Äô Communications 18.) Hamina Academia Scientiarum Fennicum. suggesting that the formula is of ancient Indo-European origin. Parallels have also been suggested with Hungarian texts.P√≥cs, √âva. \\"A ‚Äû2. merseburgi r√°olvas√°s‚Äù magyar t√≠pusai\\" [Hungarian types of the 2nd Merseburg Charm]. Olvas√≥. Tanulm√°nyok a 60 (2010): 272-281. Some commentators trace the connection back to writings in ancient India. =Other Old High German and Old Saxon spells= Other spells recorded in Old High German or Old Saxon/Old Low German noted for similarity, such as the group of wurmsegen spells for casting out the \\"Nesso\\" worm causing the affliction. There are several manuscript recensions of this spell, and Jacob Grimm scrutinizes in particular the so- called \\"Contra vermes\\" variant, in Low German from the Cod. Vidob. theol. 259 (now √ñNB Cod. 751). The text is Old High German, with a Latin title: > Contra vermes (against worms) Gang √ªt, nesso, mit nigun nessikl√Ænon, √ªt > fana themo margƒô an that b√™n, fan themo b√™ne an that fl√™sg, √ªt fana themo > fl√™sgke an thia h√ªd, √ªt fan thera h√ªd an thesa str√¢la. Drohtin, uuerthe so!. > For additional ms. details, see As Grimm explains, the spell tells the nesso worm and its nine young ones to begone, away from the marrow to bone, bone to flesh, flesh to hide (skin), and into the str√¢la or arrow, which is the implement into which the pest or pathogen is to be coaxed. It closes with the invocation: \\"Lord (Drohtin), let it be\\". Grimm insists that this charm, like the De hoc quod Spurihalz dicunt charm (MHG: spurhalz; \\"lame\\") that immediately precedes it in the manuscript, is \\"about lame horses again\\" And the \\"transitions from marrow to bone (or sinews), to flesh and hide, resemble phrases in the sprain-spells\\", i.e. the Merseburg horse-charm types. =Scandinavia= Jacob Grimm in his Deutsche Mythologie, chapter 38, listed examples of what he saw as survivals of the Merseburg charm in popular traditions of his time: from Norway a prayer to Jesus for a horse's leg injury, and two spells from Sweden, one invoking Odin (for a horse suffering from a fit or equine distemper) and another invoking Frygg for a sheep's ailment. He also quoted one Dutch charm for fixing a horse's foot, and a Scottish one for the treatment of human sprains that was still practiced in his time in the 19th century (See #Scotland below). Norway Grimm provided in his appendix another Norwegian horse spell, which has been translated and examined as a parallel by Thorpe. Grimm had recopied the spell from a tome by Hans Hammond, Nordiska Missions-historie (Copenhagen 1787), pp. 119‚Äì120, the spell being transcribed by Thomas von Westen c. 1714. This appears to be the same spell in English as given as a parallel by a modern commentator, though he apparently misattributes it to the 19th century. The texts and translations will be presented side-by-side below: > {cellpadding=\\"2\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  ::LII. gegen knochenbruchNumeral and > German title is Grimm's :Jesus reed sig til Heede, :der reed han syndt sit > Folebeen. :Jesus stigede af og l√§gte det; :Jesus lagde Marv i Marv, :Ben i > Ben, Kj√∂d i Kj√∂d ; :Jesus lagde derpaa et Blad, :At det skulde blive i samme > stad. :i tre navne etc. :(Hans Hammond, \\"Nordiska Missions-historie\\", > :Kj√∏benhavn 1787, pp.119, 120), Appendix, Spells, Spell #LVII.

Bishop Anton Christian Bang compiled a volume culled from Norwegian black books of charms and other sources, and classified the horse-mending spells under the opening chapter \\"Odin og Folebenet\\", strongly suggesting a relationship with the second Merseburg incantation.Bang's Norse hexeformulaer collection lacks commentary, but makes clear he subscribes to the parallelism view espoused by Grimm and Bugge. Bang here gives a group of 34 spells, mostly recorded in the 18th‚Äì19th century though two are assigned to the 17th (c. 1668 and 1670), and 31 of the charms are for treating horses with an injured leg. The name for the horse's trauma, which occurs in the titles, is in most of the rhymes, with smatterings of raina and bridge (sic.), but they all are essentially synonymous with brigde, glossed as the \\"dislocation of the limb\\" in Aasen's dictionary. (pdf) From Bishop Bang's collection, the following is a list of specific formulas discussed as parallels in scholarly literature: * No. 2, \\"Jesus og St. Peter over Bjergene red..\\" (c. 1668. From Lister og Mandal Amt, or the modern-day Vest-Agder. Ms. preserved at the Danish Rigsarkivet) * No. 6, Jesus red sig tile Hede..\\" (c. 1714. Ve√∏, Romsdal). Same as Grimm's LII quoted above., repr. Grimm#LVII and Bang's no.4 have spelling differences, but both cite Hammond as source, and the identity is mentioned in * No, 20, \\"Jeus rei sin Faale over en Bru..\\" (c. 1830. Sk√•bu, Oppland. However Wadstein's paper does not focus the study on the base text version, but the variant Ms. B which has the \\"Faale\\" spelling) * No. 22, \\"Vor Herre rei..\\" (c. 1847. Valle, S√¶tersdal. Recorded by J√∏rgen Moe) It might be pointed out that none of the charms in Bang's chapter \\"Odin og Folebenet\\" actually invokes Odin. The idea that the charms have been Christianized and that the presence of Baldur has been substituted by \\"The Lord\\" or Jesus is expressed by Bang in another treatise, crediting communications with Bugge and the work of Grimm in the matter. Jacob Grimm had already pointed out the Christ-Balder identification in interpreting the Merseburg charm; Grimm seized on the idea that in the Norse language, \\"White Christ (hv√≠ta Kristr)\\" was a common epithet, just as Balder was known as the \\"white √Üsir-god\\", citing Grimm's DM 1st ed., Anhang, p.cxlviii and, p.21-2 Another strikingly similar \\"horse cure\\" incantation is a 20th-century sample that hails the name of the ancient 11th-century Norwegian king Olaf II of Norway. The specimen was collected in M√∏re, Norway, where it was presented as for use in healing a bone fracture: > {cellpadding=\\"2\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  ::Les denne b√∏na: :Sankt-Olav reid i den > :gr√∏ne skog, :fekk skade p√• sin :eigen hestefot. :Bein i bein, :kj√∏t i kj√∏t, > :hud i hud. :Alt med Guds ord og amenCollected by Martin Bj√∏rndal in M√∏re > (Norway); printed in (cited by )  ::To Heal a Bone Fracture :Saint Olav > rode in :green wood; :broke his little :horse's foot. :Bone to bone, :flesh > to flesh, :skin to skin. :In the name of God, :amen.  } This example too has been commented as corresponding to the second Merseburg Charm, with Othin being replaced by Saint Olav. Sweden Several Swedish analogues were given by Sophus Bugge and by Viktor Rydberg in writings published around the same time (1889). The following 17th-century spell was noted as a parallel to the Merseburg horse charm by both of them:Studier over de nordiske Gude- and Helte-sagns Oprindelse ; Germ. tr. by Brenner, > {cellpadding=\\"2\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  :: ::(S√∂rbygdens dombok, 1672) :V√•r > herre Jesus Kristus och S. Peder de gingo eller rede √∂fver Brattebro. S. > Peders h√§st fick vre eller skre. V√•r herre steg af sin h√§st med, signa S. > Peders h√§st vre eller skre: blod vid blod, led vid led. S√• fick S.

So received St. Peter's horse > healing in three names etc. etc.  } Another example (from Kungelf's Dombok, 1629) was originally printed by Arcadius: > {cellpadding=\\"2\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  V√•r herre red ad hallen ned. Hans foles > fod vrednede ved, han stig aff, lagde leed ved leed, blod ved blod, ki√∂d ved > ki√∂d, ben ved ben, som vor herre signet folen sin, leedt ind igjen, i naffn, > o.s.v.

His foal's foot became sprained, he > dismounted, laid joint with joint, blood with blood, sinew with sinew, bone > with bone, as our Lord blessed his foal, led in again, in the name of, etc. >  } A spell beginning \\"S(anc)te P√§r och w√•r Herre de wandrade p√• en w√§g (from Sunnerbo hundred, Sm√•land 1746) was given originally by Johan Nordlander. A very salient example, though contemporary to Bugge's time, is one that invokes Odin's name: > :: ::(from Jellundtofte socken, V√§stbo hundred in Sm√•land, 19th century) > {cellpadding=\\"2\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  Oden rider √∂fver sten och b√§rg han rider > sin h√§st ur vred och i led, ur olag och i lag, ben till ben, led till led, > som det b√§st var, n√§r det helt var.  Odin rides over rock and hill; he > rides his horse out of a sprain and into joint out of disorder and into > order, bone to bone, joint to joint, as it was best, when it was whole.  } Denmark A Danish parallel noted by A. Kuhn is the following: > {cellpadding=\\"2\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  :: :: Jesus op ad Bierget red; der vred > han sin Fod af Led. Saa satte han sig ned at signe. Saa sagde han: Jeg > signer Sener i Sener, Aarer i Aarer, Ki√∏d i Ki√∏d, Og Blod i Blod! Saa satte > han Haanden til Jorden ned, Saa l√¶gedes hans Fodeled! I Navnet o.s.v.  :: > :: Jesus up the mountain did ride; sprained his foot in the joint. He sat > down for a blessing, and so said he: I bless tendon to tendon vein to vein, > flesh to flesh, and blood to blood! So he set his hand down on the ground > below, and bonded were his joints together! In the Name, etc.  } =Scotland= Grimm also exemplified a Scottish charm (for people, not horses) as a salient remnant of the Merseburg type of charm. This healing spell for humans was practiced in Shetland (which has strong Scandinavian ties and where the Norn language used to be spoken). The practice involved tying a \\"wresting thread\\" of black wool with nine knots around the sprained leg of a person, and in an inaudible voice pronouncing the following: Alexander Macbain (who also supplies a presumably reconstructed Gaelic \\"Chaidh Criosd a mach/Air maduinn mhoich\\" to the first couplet of \\"The Lord rade\\" charm above) also records a version of a horse spell which was chanted while \\"at the same time tying a worsted thread on the injured limb\\"., > {cellpadding=\\"2\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  Chaidh Criosda mach Sa' mhaduinn moich > 'S fhuair e casan nan each, Air am bristeadh mu seach.

Christ went > forth In the early morn And found the horses' legs Broken across. He put > bone to bone. Sinew to sinew, Flesh to flesh. And skin to skin; And as He > healed that, May I heal this.  } Macbain goes on to quote another Gaelic horse spell, one beginning \\"Chaidh Br√¨de mach..\\" from Cuairtear nan Gleann (July 1842) that invokes St. Bride as a \\"he\\" rather than \\"she\\", plus additional examples suffering from corrupted text. =Ancient India= There have been repeated suggestions that healing formula of the Second Merseburg Charm may well have deep Indo-European roots. A parallel has been drawn between this charm and an example in Vedic literature, an incantation from the 2nd millennium BCE found in the Atharvaveda, hymn IV, 12:, quote: \\"The parallels of the Merserburger Charm in Vedic literature\\", is followed by the text of the Atharvaveda 4,12 and translation by ., \\"one of the 'Merseburger Zauberspruche' (Merseburg Spells) which has its parallel in the Atharvaveda\\" > {cellpadding=\\"2\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  :1. r√≥ha·πáy asi r√≥hany asth·πáa√ß chinn√°sya > r√≥ha·πá√Æ :: r√≥h√°ye 'd√°m arundhati :2. y√°t te rish·π≠√°·πÉ y√°t te dyutt√°m √°sti > p√©sh·π≠ra·πÉ te √¢tm√°ni :: dh√¢t·∫• t√°d bhadr√°y√¢ p√∫na·∏• s√°·πÉ dadhat p√°rush√¢ p√°ru·∏• :3. > s√°·πÉ te majj·∫• majj√±·∫• bhavatu s√°mu te p√°rush√¢ p√°ru·∏• ::s√°·πÉ te m√¢ms√°sya > v√≠srasta·πÉ s√°·πÉ √°sthy √°pi rohatu :4. majj·∫• majj√±·∫• s√°·πÉ dh√Æyat√¢·πÉ c√°rma·πá√¢ c√°rma > rohatu ::√°s·πõk te √°sthi rohatu ·πÉ√¢·πás√°·πÉ m√¢·πás√©na rohatu :5. l√≥ma l√≥mn√¢ s√°·πÉ > kalpay√¢ tvac·∫• s√°·πÉ kalpay√¢ tv√°cam ::√°s·πõk te √°sthi rohatu chinn√°·πÉ s√°·πÉ dhehy > oshadhe  :1.

The name \\"√éle Pavie\\" was given in 1909 by the French Antarctic Expedition led by Jean-Baptiste Charcot to an island (or possibly a cape) shown on the French Antarctic Expedition maps at . From a position 15 miles southeast of Jenny Island, Maurice Bongrain, surveyor of the French Antarctic Expedition, made sketches of this feature which were labeled \\"√éle Pavie\\" and \\"Cap Pavie\\". Pavie Ridge was named by Charcot presumably for Auguste J. M. Pavie (1847-1925), French diplomat and explorer. This general area was surveyed in 1936 by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) under John Riddoch Rymill, but the feature already named by Charcot was not identified. After later surveys by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) in 1948, Charcot's \\"√éle Pavie\\" was identified from Bongrain's sketches as the feature now named Red Rock Ridge. The name Red Rock Ridge had become too firmly established to alter; thus, the original name Pavie Ridge has been approved for the isolated rocky ridge described above as forming the southern limit of the Bertrand Ice Piedmont.

Steinhardt (born December 7, 1940) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. In 1967, he founded a hedge fund, Steinhardt Partners, that averaged an annualized return for its clients of 24.5% from 1967 to 1995. His fund lost 1/3 of its value in the 1994 bond market crisis.The great bond massacre - Fortune, December 1994; republished 3 February 2013 In 1995, he closed his fund stating, \\"I thought there must be something more virtuous, more ennobling to do with one's life than make rich people richer,\\" before making a 2004 comeback to head WisdomTree Investments, a fund with nearly US$43 billion in assets under management. In a January 2014 article by Bloomberg, he was referred to as \\"Wall Street's greatest trader.\\"Sebastian Mallaby (2010). More Money Than God, pg.41 Forbes Magazine reported his net worth at $1.1 billion as of October 2018.  Early life and education  Steinhardt earned a BS at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1960. He started his career working for the mutual fund Calvin Bullock and the brokerage firm Loeb, Rhoades & Co. (the precursor to Shearson Loeb Rhoades). Steinhardt's father was his first investment client giving his son envelopes stuffed with cash to put in the stock market giving him seed money to begin his investment career.  Investment career  Early career = Working as an analyst at Loeb, Rhoades & Co., Steinhardt followed the conglomerate industry, which included companies such as Automatic Sprinkler (now defunct), City Investing (also defunct), and the best-known conglomerate of its day, Gulf+Western (now part of Viacom and Viacom's spinoff CBS). = Steinhardt Partners = In 1967, using earnings from his investments, Steinhardt founded the hedge fund Steinhardt, Fine, and Berkowitz (later Steinhardt Partners) with co-investors William Salomon, former managing partner of Salomon Brothers and Jack Nash, founder of Odyssey Partners. Steinhardt Partners averaged an annualized return for its clients of 24.5%, after a 1% management fee and a \\"performance fee\\" of 15% (early in his career, later 20%) of all annual gains, realized and unrealized, nearly triple the annualized performance of the S&P; 500 Index over the same timeframe. After decades of successfully managing the fund, Steinhardt and his firm were investigated for allegedly trying to manipulate the short-term Treasury Note market in the early 1990s. He personally paid 75% of a total fine of $70 million as part of settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice. His firm made $600 million on the Treasury positions. In his book, \\"No Bull,\\" Steinhardt said he did nothing wrong, but merely settled the case in order to \\"move on.\\" Following a negative performance in his hedge fund in 1994, Steinhardt Partners enjoyed an excellent 1995, with performance in line with its historical record. The hedge fund closed and distributed all monies to its limited partners at the end of 1995. = WisdomTree Investments = In 2004, Steinhardt came out of retirement to work for Index Development Partners, Inc., now known as WisdomTree Investments. He is chairman of WisdomTree, which offers dividend and earnings-based index funds rather than traditional index funds based on market capitalization. As of July 2018, WisdomTree had $41.2 billion under management. During the fall of 2007 and 2008, WisdomTree's growth stagnated, as the stock market, especially the financial sector, in which WisdomTree's dividend-based funds are overweighted, tanked, as did WisdomTree's stock. However, in recent months, as the WisdomTree funds tended to outperform their \\"bogies,\\" asset growth resumed its earlier pace and its stock price appreciated accordingly.  Personal life  St. Peter in Prison (The Apostle Peter Kneeling), Rembrandt, 1631. In 1967, Steinhardt met his future wife Judy in a car pool he organized. During one of the carpools into New York City, he mentioned the name of the grain elevator company Colorado Milling and Grain Elevator. Judy mentioned the company to her father who invested in the company and made a substantial profit after Colorado Milling was acquired by Great Western Sugar in 1968; the merged company was renamed Great Western United. Judy is the chairwoman of New York University's Institute of Fine Arts and of the American Friends of the Israel Museum. They have three children: David, Daniel and Sara. His daughter, Sara, a former journalist and parenting columnist for The New York Sun, is married to Mark Bloom and is the president of the Hebrew Language Academy Charter School in Brooklyn. In Sebastian Mallaby's 2010 book entitled More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of a New Elite, he dedicated a chapter to Michael Steinhardt. He described Steinhardt as a \\"lover of botany and a collector of exotic fauna,\\" living in his retirement \\"on his country estate an hour's drive north of New York City.\\" Mallaby includes a photo of Steinhardt \\"dancing on his estate opposite... an elegant blue crane . . . that had taken to courting him with a graceful gavotte.\\" In 2001, Steinhardt published an autobiography: No Bull: My Life in and out of Markets. In this book, he addressed for the first time the question of his father, Sol Frank Steinhardt, who also went by the moniker \\"Red McGee.\\" \\"Red\\" Steinhardt was convicted in 1958 on two counts of buying and selling stolen jewelry, and was sentenced to serve two 5-to-10 year terms, to run consecutively, in the New York State prison system. In his book, Steinhardt describes how his father bankrolled his early forays into the stock market by giving him envelopes stuffed with $10,000 in cash and sometimes much more than that. The book also suggests that Steinhardt's education at the Wharton School may have been paid for with illicit funds. Steinhardt is an art collector, especially of antiquities. Highlights of his Judaica collection are viewable online. A special exhibition, \\"Ancient Art of the Cyclades\\", held at the Katonah Museum of Art included some pieces owned by him. He also sits on the American advisory board of Christie's, the art & antiques auction house. In January, 2018, investigators raided his New York apartment in order to seize looted antiquities  Political and economic views  Steinhardt is active in political circles ranging from centrist Democratic to neo-conservative, having been a past chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council and a board member of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, to which he donated $250,000 in 2002. According to Newsmeat.com, a tracker of publicly available campaign contributions, in the 2000 New York senatorial primary, he donated $1,000 (then the maximum allowable under law) to Republican Rudy Giuliani. When Mayor Giuliani dropped out of the race, Steinhardt contributed an equal amount to Giuliani's successor, Rick Lazio. Steinhardt also gave $1,000 to Lazio in the general election. Steinhardt is a strong supporter of the State of Israel, which he regards as the \\"Jewish miracle of the 20th century\\". He views Israel as \\"the most moral state on this planet\\", and in a 2017 interview said \\"The more one understands about Israel, the more comfortable one becomes with the politics of the Israeli government.\\"Ben Sales, Michael Steinhardt thinks American Jews need to stop focusing on religion, Jewish Telegraphic Agency; June 9, 2017. In 2001, Steinhardt made his foray into publishing, he along with several other investors including Conrad Black, founded the New York Sun, a niche New York City newspaper best known for its unflinching pro-Israel support and generally (but not invariably) neo-conservative outlook. Steinhardt wrote a letter to President Clinton advocating the pardon of Marc Rich, calling him \\"my friend...who has been punished enough\\" (on January 20, 2001, Clinton's last day in office, Rich was in fact pardoned.) Steinhardt was an early promoter of the possible presidential candidacy of Michael Bloomberg in 2008.  Wealth and philanthropy  Forbes Magazine reported Steinhardt's net worth at US$1.1 billion as of October 2018. The Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development at New York University bears his name in recognition of two $10 million donations.http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/archives/14/04/steinhardt.nyu In the 1990s, Steinhardt bought and donated Steeple Jason Island and Grand Jason Island in the Falkland Islands to the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), along with US$425,000 for a research station to be named after himself and his wife. Steinhardt invested in baseball teams, owning part of the Miami Marlins and the Los Angeles Dodgers. =Jewish causes= Steinhardt is chairman of the board at The Steinhardt Foundation for Jewish Life and Taglit-Birthright Israel. He also makes public appearances, speaking with young Jewish kids through organizations such as Ezra USA and RAJE. He has been an active philanthropist, donating over $125 million to Jewish causes. He and Charles Bronfman co-founded Taglit-Birthright Israel, which has to date sent over 500,000 young Jews aged 18‚Äì26 on a 10-day trip to Israel without charge. In 2009 Steinhardt gave the American Hebrew Academy $5 million. In addition, to help with its fundraising, AHA (American Hebrew Academy) released an advertisement featuring his endorsement. Steinhardt has founded a network of Hebrew-language charter schools, which are secular and open to both Jews and non-Jews. He has said \\"these schools teach Hebrew in a way that is demonstrably superior to Jewish day schools\\". Steinhardt is part of the \\"Mega Group\\" - a loosely organized club of 20 of wealthy and most influential Jewish businessmen. The \\"Mega Group\\" was formed by Leslie Wexner, chairman of Limited Inc. and Charles and Edgar Bronfman Sr., chairmen of Seagram.Titans of Industry Join Forces To Work for Jewish Philanthropy, The Wall Street Journal, 4 May 1998  Investigation into inappropriate sexual remarks  On September 12, 2018 The Jewish Week reported that Hillel International was investigating Steinhardt for unwelcome ‚Äúinappropriate sexual remarks‚Äù by two female employees of one of the many organizations he supports. The Jewish Week story quoted ‚Äúsources close to the investigation‚Äù as saying that since, 2015, when the first complaint by a female employee occurred, it has been a ‚Äúpractice‚Äù within the organization for no female employee to have meetings with Steinhardt alone. The second woman making allegations received a written apology from Steinhardt, dated Aug. 23, 2011, acknowledging his inappropriate comments made toward her and two male colleagues at a meeting the year before. The report noted that Hillel had ‚Äúquietly‚Äù removed his name from the board of governors listed on their website while the organization was investigating the claims. Hillel made an official statement that the complaints about sexual harassment by its donors were justified. Steinhardt stated in response to the findings ‚ÄúIf I had been told immediately about concerns regarding anything I said at the time, I would have apologized immediately. I only recently learned about this investigation when Hillel called me about comments I made several years ago. I am sorry and deeply regret causing any embarrassment, discomfort or pain, which was never my intention.‚Äù As of March 2019, six women have claimed that Steinhardt had made sexual requests of them.  Legacy and awards  In 2008, he was inducted into Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, George Soros, Jack Nash, James Simons, Julian Roberston, Kenneth Griffin, Leon Levy, Louis Bacon, Paul Tudor Jones, Seth Klarman and Steven A.

The natural wetlands once included the areas now taken up by Marina del Rey, New Amsterdam Canals of Venice, Playa Vista, northern Playa del Rey, and formerly extended northerly beyond Venice Boulevard to the historical Venice Canals that are now covered in asphalt with 6 streets.Former Ballona Wetlands Area The Ballona Wetlands State Ecological Reserve is one of the last significant estuarine and freshwater wetland landscapes in coastal Los Angeles County and is named after the Mexican Rancho La Ballona, for which later Port Ballona and Ballona Creek derive their names. Lower Ballona Creek flows through the estuarine wetland between two earthen levees that flank the soft-bottom soil with a unique marine infauna, found only in this tidal river, and which is nearly fully covered with ocean water only at high tide, twice each day. Intermingled with the estuary and at the peripheral boundaries of the wetland landscape are habitats including coastal sand dunes with unique sand dune ecology, meadow grassland, coastal prairie, coastal willow woodland, coastal shrubland, salt pannes and pools, and coastal urban forests. In the 1930s, upper Ballona Creek was completely channelized, from the bottom to top, in concrete,Ballona Creek Cement Channel thus greatly increasing the inflow of ocean water further inland up the river, but simultaneously reducing ocean water to the marsh beyond the levee walls, as well as eliminating wet season rainwater runoff, which brought freshwater to the marsh plain. Among the many groups dedicated to protecting the wetlands are the Ballona Institute, Friends of Ballona Wetlands, Ballona Wetlands Land Trust, Grassroots Coalition, Ballona Ecosystem Education Project, Los Angeles Audubon Society, and Sierra Club. HistoryTongva Native AmericansMexican ranchos and early American era= Rancho La Ballona =Water control= In addition to functioning as a tidal river estuary, Ballona Creek also acts as a Flood control channel, and the construction of an estuarine harbor and port called Marina del Rey in the late 1950s, increased the urbanized estuary by . Additional open space east of the wetlands was converted to agricultural uses by the early 20th century, with cultivation continuing into the 1990s, when these became some of the last farm fields in the Los Angeles Basin. In the 1940s, much of these farm fields became the private Hughes Airport. In the first decade of the 21st century that land was developed as Playa Vista, a planned mixed-use community east of Lincoln Boulevard. =Land owners and issues= The State of California owns and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) manages the wetlands. Approximately , are bisected generally east‚Äìwest by the Ballona Creek channel, from Playa Del Rey to Culver City, and bordered by the 90 Marina freeway to the east. of estuarine wetland were included in the state acquisition, previously privately owned by Howard Hughes, his corporate heirs and the subsequent developers of Playa Vista. These estuarine wetlands, and the remaining open space, have been the subject of a battle between developers and environmentalists that has been ongoing for decades. Numerous environmental lawsuits and the acquisition of a part of the Wetlands by the State of California has helped to protect a portion of this area, including nearly all the open space west of Lincoln Blvd. (including all of the remaining tidal wetlands).Ballona Wetland Restoration Project Description In 2002, remains of California Native American Tongva villages, artifacts, and buried ancestors were found during excavation on the Playa Vista site. =The Ballona Wetlands Restoration Project= On January 28, 2013, the Annenberg Foundation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the CDFW and the State Coastal Conservancy (SCC) to explore the possibility of creating an interpretive center and related public access amenities for the Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve (BWER).Ballona Wetlands Restoration Project The Annenberg Foundation suspended its controversial plan to build a $50-million visitors center at the BWER in December 2014.Groves, Martha (December 2, 2014) \\"Annenberg Foundation suspends plan for Ballona Wetlands visitors center\\" Los Angeles Times On September 25, 2017, CDFW released, for public review and comment, its draft Environmental Impact Report detailing three restoration alternatives. Natural HistoryFlora= The Ballona Wetlands, is a habitat of a marine estuary alongside grassland, woodland, sand dune, and freshwater wetland ecosystems. Historically the outlet-mouth of the Los Angeles River switched, between San Pedro Bay and the Ballona creek watercourse to Santa Monica Bay, several times in the early 19th century only.

It is sometimes called covert photography. A person may be unaware of being photographed in a variety of situations, such as: The British Army in North-west Europe 1944‚Äì45 (image taken covertly) * Fixed or mobile closed- circuit television surveillance in public and private areas. * Stalking by photographers of celebrities. * Use of a hidden camera in investigative journalism. * During industrial espionage. * During intelligence gathering by police or private investigators. * During the investigation phase of workman's compensation claim adjudication. * By vigilantes. * By political protesters or activists. * By academics such as ethnographic researchers or participant observer sociologists. * As a prank, e.g. from a friend's mobile camera phone. * By voyeurs for sexual or other purposes Sometimes normal cameras are used, but the photographer is concealed. Sometimes the camera itself is disguised or concealed. Some obvious element of concealment (or great distance) is generally needed to make such photography fall under the category of 'secret photography' rather than street photography or documentary photography. It has been in use by British police since intelligence gathering on the suffragette movement in the 1900s.\\"Spy pictures of suffragettes revealed\\". BBC, 3 October 2003: For an in-depth British history see: Bunyan, Tony. The Political Police in Britain. Quartet Books, 1977.

Although spy cameras small enough to fit inside a pocket watch had existed since the 1880s, since the 1950s advances in miniaturisation and electronics has greatly aided the ability to conceal miniature cameras, and the quality and affordability of tiny cameras (often called \\"spy cameras\\" or subminiature cameras) has now greatly increased. Some consumer compact digital cameras are now so small that in previous decades they would have qualified as \\"spy cameras\\", and digital cameras of 41 megapixels are now being embedded in some mobile camera phones. For larger cameras (DSLR or EVIL), right-angle mirror attachments are commercially available that, when mounted on long-focus lenses, can deceive the subject by producing the impression that the camera is pointed in a different direction. Some fine art photographers have displayed a fascination with the forms of secret voyeuristic photography. Voyeuristic photography has also been centrally explored in movies such as Powell & Pressburger's Peeping Tom, and Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup, and has appeared to comic effect in films such as Gregory's Girl and American Pie. Laws and ethics There are various personal privacy laws in different countries which also impact on the secret photography of individuals, and on the publication of any resulting pictures. France for instance, has very strict laws against publication of such images,\\"The notoriously strict privacy laws in France ensure that such intrusion into the private lives of public figures is rare\\" ‚Äì The Daily Telegraph 28 August 2005 ‚Äì this refers to the \\"Presumption of Innocence and Rights of Victims\\" (2001) law, prohibiting the publication of \\"any photograph of a person without their express consent\\".

It is the first main installment in the Guitar Hero series. Guitar Hero was released in November 2005 in North America, April 2006 in Europe and June 2006 in Australia. The game's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks-like game to United States. The game features a guitar- shaped controller (resembling a miniature Gibson SG) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music. The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks, in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century. The game's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise, which has earned more than $2 billion in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.  Gameplay  To play a note, the fret button and strum bar must be pressed when the solid note scrolls through the corresponding ring at the bottom. The interface shows the player's score and score multiplier (left), Star Power meter (right), and Rock Meter (bottom right). The gameplay is similar to other music and rhythm video games, in that the player must press buttons on a game controller in time with scrolling notes on the game screen to complete a song. The basic mechanics are based on Konami's Guitar Freaks. In the case of Guitar Hero, the player may use either the guitar peripheral (a 3/4-scale reproduction of the Gibson SG guitar as bundled with the game, or a third-party version) or a standard controller to play the scrolling notes. The guitar peripheral has five different-colored fret buttons near the nut of the guitar neck, and a strum bar and a whammy bar on the body of the guitar. The peripheral also has other buttons in order to navigate the game's menus. Music is displayed on screen through a series of notes, matching in color and position to the fret buttons, that scroll down the screen on a fret board. To hit or play a note, the player must hold down the fret button corresponding to the note shown and toggle the strum bar at the same time as that note passes a marked area on the screen. Faster series of notes may be played on the guitar controller using hammer-on and pull-off techniques where the player does not need to strum each note. The game supports toggling the handedness of the guitar, allowing both left-handed and right-handed players to utilize the guitar controller. A player using the standard controller simply presses the buttons that correspond with the displayed notes as outlined in the game's manual. The player is awarded points for correctly hitting notes, chords and sustains. The player can also increase a score multiplier by playing a series of consecutive notes successfully. A \\"Rock Meter\\" tracks the player's performance based on success or failure of hitting notes, and if the meter drops too low the song will prematurely end in failure for the player. The player can also earn \\"Star Power\\" by playing a series of glowing notes perfectly and using the whammy bar during sustains. Once the Star Power meter is filled at least halfway, Star Power can then be activated by briefly tilting the guitar controller vertically, or by pressing a specific button on a standard controller. Activating Star Power will double the scoring multiplier and makes it easier to increase the Rock Meter by playing correct notes. Thus, players can strategically use Star Power to play through difficult sections of a song they might have otherwise failed. = Modes and other features = Guitar Hero's main mode of play is Career Mode, where the player and in-game band travel between various fictional performance arenas and perform sets of four or five songs. Completing songs in this mode unlocks the songs for play within the other game modes. Players can choose their on-stage character and their guitar; these elements have no effect on gameplay but affect the visuals during the performance. In Career Mode, players can earn money from their performances that is redeemable at the in- game store, where bonus content, such as additional songs, guitars and finishes, can be unlocked. Quick Play mode allows the player to play any unlocked track, selecting the difficulty, the character, venue and guitar. After successfully completing a song in either Career or Quick Play mode, the player is given a score and a rating between three-five stars, depending on his or her overall performance. Multiplayer mode offers two players the chance to compete against each other on the same song. Two fret boards will appear on screen, one for each player, as they alternate playing sections of the song in a dueling manner. The player with the highest score at the end of the song wins. The four difficulty levels for each song afford the player a learning curve in order to help him or her progress in skill. The first difficulty level, Easy, only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced amount of notes for the player to play. Medium introduces a fourth fret button while adding more notes, and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes. Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn, but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player.  Development  The controller that was packaged with the game, an approximately 3/4-scale reproduction of a Gibson SG According to Rob Kay, the game's Lead Designer, the idea of Guitar Hero was directly inspired by Konami's Guitar Freaks arcade game, where the player used a guitar-shaped controller to interact with the game. At the time, GuitarFreaks had not seen much exposure in North America. RedOctane was making dance pads for games like Dance Dance Revolution for home consoles and also operated an online video rental service similar to Netflix. RedOctane's Kai and Charles Huang recognized the popularity of GuitarFreaks in Japan through their rental service, and planned to create guitar controllers to bring the game to North America. The Huangs raised $1.75 million for the effort, despite being turned down by some investors who \\"thought [the idea] was too weird\\". Greg Fischbach, one of the founders of Acclaim Entertainment, noted, regretfully several years later, they had passed on Guitar Hero, questioning \\"Who's going to buy a peripheral like that?\\" The Huangs approached Harmonix, who had previously made music video games such as Frequency, Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution about making a guitar-based video game for those controllers. With a budget of about one million dollars (which Kay noted was \\"pretty tiny for a video game\\"), the two companies worked together to develop Guitar Hero. Kay noted that \\"No one had any notions about it being a massive success; we all just thought it would be fun to do.\\" Harmonix's president Alex Rigopulos also claims that former Microsoft vice-president of game publishing Ed Fries indirectly influenced the game's creation, who had previously told Harmonix when they were pitching Frequency to Microsoft that no music-rhythm game would succeed without custom hardware for it, prompting Rigopulos to investigate the Guitar Hero opportunity when it arose. The team quickly recognized that \\"the controller really was the kind of magic sauce for what we wanted to do\\". They identified three aspects of gameplay that they felt made the game stand out. These aspects included the note-matching aspect and the showmanship created by the use of the whammy bar and tilting of the guitar within the game. The third key aspect was the use of Star Power \\"to provide a little more depth to the game ‚Äî some replay value, some interest for people as they were playing beyond just hitting the notes\\". Harmonix used third party controllers made for GuitarFreaks that were already on the market for development of the game until RedOctane had prepared prototypes for the Guitar Hero controller. The controller initially had pressure-sensitive fret buttons to mimic the playing of a real guitar, but the idea was dropped as it made the gameplay too complex. The idea of using the whammy bar to boost Star Power, in addition to altering the pitch of sustained notes was only realized about a month before the completion of the game. The team had spent \\"precious development time and resources\\" into creating a free-style model that would have allowed players to improvise during songs but ultimately cut it as they could not work the feature into the existing gameplay. \\"Gem tracks\\", the pattern of notes for a song, were developed by a team in Harmonix, taking usually a day to develop the tracks for one song. Tracks were designed to include key notes to \\"make [the player] feel as if [he is] a brilliant musician\\". Software algorithms were used to assess the difficulty of the tracks, and the quality assurance team helped to rebalance the tracks for accuracy and difficulty. The software also allowed Harmonix to quickly make changes to the set list or to recreate the tracks for a song to make sure the overall difficulty of the game was appropriate. At the onset of development, the team did not have any idea of what songs would be present in the final game. Kay noted that \\"We wanted 30 or 40 songs for the game and put a hundred on our wish list.\\" The game was to focus mostly on hard rock songs, but the team was limited by what could be licensed. The team also felt \\"morally obligated\\" to include older, classic rock songs like The Ramones \\"I Wanna Be Sedated\\" to the younger target audience of the game. Harmonix had to modify the track list throughout development as certain songs were introduced or removed based on licensing issues, requiring the team to repeatedly balance difficulty and popularity of the track list. WaveGroup Sound were used to create the covers of the licensed songs provided in the game. Marcus Henderson of the band Drist provided many of the lead guitar tracks for the covers. WaveGroup Sound also went to efforts to try to recreate effects for some songs. In the case of Black Sabbaths \\"Iron Man\\", the team learned that the vocal effects were created by having Ozzy Osbourne sing from behind a metal fan. The team sought out the same model of fan through Craigslist to generate the same effect in the game's cover. Many of the bonus songs were from groups that Harmonix employees were part of or knew. Additionally, a \\"Be a Guitar Hero\\" contest was held allowing bands to submit their own song to be included in the game. The winning song was \\"Cheat on the Church\\" by Graveyard BBQ. Black Label Societys song, \\"Fire it Up\\", was included two weeks before the game was completed at the request of Zakk Wylde. The final song list was set very near to the shipping date. Guitar Hero started with \\"super-basic Pong-style graphics\\" for the game display. The final game art was led by Ryan Lesser, using the art team's involvement in the music scene. Based on the experience from Frequency and Amplitude, the team realized that \\"people dont necessarily relate to really abstract visuals\\", and included the depictions of live performances as previously used in Karaoke Revolution. House of Moves were used to assist in creation motion capture for the on- screen animations. The appearance of Star Power was made to resemble electricity, both to reflect the use of the electric guitar as well to conceptually demonstrate the excitement of the performance and the virtual audience. Guitar Hero was initially released to retail stores in a bundle that packaged the game disc and a Gibson SG guitar controller, priced at $69.99. Since its release, stand-alone copies of the games and the guitar controller have been released, including both RedOctane and third-party controllers from TAC and Nyko. MadCatz, another controller company that has produced guitar controllers, was set to initially be part of the game's development, creating a version of the game for the Xbox, but had to pull out due to a lawsuit by Komani; MadCatz's Darrel Richardson stated they had to pay $300,000 to get out of their contract with RedOctane.  Soundtrack  Guitar Hero features 47 playable songs, 30 of which are \\"main setlist\\" tracks that are covers of popular songs. Featured tracks include \\"Iron Man\\" by Black Sabbath, \\"Take Me Out\\" by Franz Ferdinand, \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" by Jimi Hendrix, \\"Bark at the Moon\\" by Ozzy Osbourne, \\"Smoke on the Water\\" by Deep Purple, \\"Crossroads\\" by Cream, and \\"Fat Lip\\" by Sum 41. All cover tracks are credited on screen with the phrase \\"as made famous by\\" (e.g., \\"'I Wanna Be Sedated', as made famous by The Ramones\\"). The other 17 songs are master recordings selected from indie groups, most of which are formed by Harmonix employees.  Reception  Guitar Hero received critical acclaim upon release. It received a score of 91.96% on GameRankings and 91/100 on Metacritic. IGN praised the \\"fantastic soundtrack\\" and \\"great peripheral\\", further commenting that mini-Gibson SG controller \\"is what makes Guitar Hero, rather than what breaks it\\". GameSpot echoed these sentiments, stating Guitar Hero had a \\"great guitar controller\\" and \\"killer soundtrack\\" and was possibly the \\"best rhythm game ever made\\". Many reviews praised the game's gradual learning curve and difficulty approach through the song tier progression and the difficulty setting for each song. Play said the game \\"gives bedroom air guitarists a chance to live out their rock 'n' roll fantasies\\". GameSpys review commented on the length of the songs, in that \\"once you hit the three minute mark or so, things start to feel 'too long'\\". Eurogamer said, \\"the lack of international star quality about the roster of songs and the absence of the original artists is perhaps the only thing that may detract from the package from an importer's perspective\\" and \\"it would have been truly amazing with a better track list\\". Shortly after release, Guitar Hero became an unexpected hit; it was the second-highest-selling PlayStation 2 title in February 2006 according to the NPD Group. Game sales amounted to $45 million in 2005. Since then, the game has sold about 1.53 million copies through December 2007. The success of the game has spawned a one billion dollar Guitar Hero franchise, including four sequels on several seventh generation consoles, seven expansions, a mobile phone-based version, and a portable version for the Nintendo DS. Harmonix no longer is involved in development of the series, due to its acquisition by MTV. Harmonix has since developed Rock Band using designs similar to those that based Guitar Hero's success. The game and its sequels have created interest in young adults and children in learning how to play a real guitar, and has been considered as a \\"cultural phenomenon\\" that has created a significant cultural impact. At the end of 2009, several journalists, including Wired, G4TV, CNN, the San Jose Mercury News, the Toronto Star, Inc., The Guardian, and Advertising Age, considered Guitar Hero to be one of the most influential products of the first decade of the 21st century, attributing it as the spark leading to the growth of the rhythm game market, for boosting music sales for both new and old artists, for introducing more social gaming concepts to the video game market, and, in conjunction with the Wii, for improving interactivity with gaming consoles. = Awards = Guitar Hero has won several awards. In IGNs \\"Best of 2005\\", the game was recognized for \\"Best Music Game\\", \\"Best PlayStation 2 Music Game\\", \\"Best Licensed Soundtrack\\", \\"Best Licensed Soundtrack for PlayStation 2\\", \\"Best Offline Multiplayer Game\\", \\"Best PlayStation 2 Offline Multiplayer Game\\", and \\"Best Gaming Peripheral\\" (for the Mini Gibson SG controller). GameSpot also recognized the game in its \\"Best and Worst of 2005\\", awarding it honors for \\"Best Puzzle/Rhythm Game\\", \\"Most Metal\\", and \\"Reader's Choice ‚Äì Best Puzzle/Rhythm Game\\". The Game Developers Choice Awards honored Guitar Hero for \\"Excellence in Audio\\" and \\"Excellence in Game Innovation\\". The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' 2005 Interactive Achievement Awards honored the game with awards for \\"Game of the Year\\", \\"Outstanding Achievement in Game Design\\", \\"Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering\\" (tie), and \\"Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack\\".

Each computable function has an infinite number of different program representations in a given programming language. In the theory of algorithms one often strives to find a program with the smallest complexity for a given computable function and a given complexity measure (such a program could be called optimal). Blum's speedup theorem shows that for any complexity measure there are computable functions that are not optimal with respect to that measure. This also rules out the idea there is a way to assign to arbitrary functions their computational complexity, meaning the assignment to any f of the complexity of an optimal program for f. This does of course not exclude the possibility of finding the complexity of an optimal program for certain specific functions.  Speedup theorem  Given a Blum complexity measure (\\\\varphi, \\\\Phi) and a total computable function f with two parameters, then there exists a total computable predicate g (a boolean valued computable function) so that for every program i for g, there exists a program j for g so that for almost all x :f(x, \\\\Phi_j(x)) \\\\leq \\\\Phi_i(x) \\\\, f is called the speedup function.

Of the five known 1864 cyclones, four were first documented in 1995 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz. In the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated. The first system was initially observed offshore the Southeastern United States on July 16\\\\. It peaked as a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Moving rapidly northeastward, the storm was last noted well east of Newfoundland on July 18\\\\. The next system was observed in the south-central Gulf of Mexico on July 25\\\\. Because the cyclone was not tracked further, only a single-point storm path exists. After tropical cyclogenesis was dormant for over a month, another hurricane was spotted on August 26 to the east of Lesser Antilles. Early on the following day, the hurricane crossed the islands between Dominica and Martinique. After traversing the Caribbean Sea, the storm made landfall in Belize late on August 31, before dissipating the next day. Offshore Belize, several ships encountered the storm. Along the coast, storm surge flooded some areas. The fourth tropical storm was observed off the East Coast of the United States between September 5 and September 9\\\\. A number of ships sailing in the vicinity of the storm encountered heavy gales. The fifth and final known tropical cyclone was also tracked offshore the East Coast of the United States.

The Hattie Eaton reported sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) - equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Early on July 18, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm. Several hours later, the storm was last noted by ship Energy, while located about east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. =Tropical Storm Two= This storm is known from a single ship report. On July 25, the bark Daniel bound for New York from Matamoros, Tamaulipas encountered a tropical storm off the Alacran reef, north of the Yucatan Peninsula. The vessel spent several hours in the cyclone and was also struck by lightning. =Hurricane Three= A hurricane was first observed well east of the Lesser Antilles on August 26\\\\. The storm moved westward and brought severe weather to Martinique, including hurricane-force winds. Throughout its trek across the Caribbean Sea, the system maintained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Late on August 31, the hurricane made landfall in Belize District of Belize. Off the coast, several ships were damaged or sunk. The brig Antonio, the Hannah, and the bark Berkshire were among the ships that capsized. On land, tides up to above normal caused coastal flooding in Belize. This storm has been paleotempestologically traced in sediment near Gales Point. The system steadily weakened over land. =Tropical Storm Four= Based on reports from several ships, a tropical storm is known to have existed off the East Coast of the United States between September 5 and September 8. A number of ships approaching New York on September 5 reported an easterly gale. Vessels off Hatteras and Barnegat endured the storm through September 8. =Hurricane Five= The final tropical cyclone of the season was observed by the Santa Martha early on October 22, while located about 355 mi (570 km) east-northeast of the Abaco Islands. Based on reports from several ships, it quickly moved northward and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane by midday on October 23\\\\. Around that time, the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The storm moved rapidly east-northeastward and was last noted about south-southwest of Sable Island late on October 24\\\\.

The genus is widespread throughout the tropical regions of the world. It includes the canistel (P. campechiana), the Mamey sapote (P. sapota), and the lucuma (P. lucuma). Commonly, this genus is known as pouteria trees, or in some cases, eggfruits. Pouteria is related to Manilkara, another genus that produces hard and heavy woods (e.g. balat√°, M. bidentata) used commonly for tropical construction, as well as edible fruit (such as sapodilla, M. zapota).  Uses  P. ramiflora Many species, like Pouteria maclayanaPaper from the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies have edible fruits and are important foods, seasonally. Some are being commercially collected and sold on local markets or packed in cans. Pouteria species yield hard, heavy, resilient woods used as firewood and timber, but particularly in outdoor and naval construction, such as dock pilings, deckings, etc. Some species, such as abiu (P. caimito), are considered to be shipworm resistant; however, this depends on the silica content, which may vary from 0.0-0.9%. The weight by volume (at 12% moisture content) of Pouteria wood can be in excess of 1140 kg/m3 (71 lb/ft3; thus, the wood sinks in water. The wood of Pouteria species is prone to considerable movement and warping when it dries out, but in its main use, naval construction, this is not a problem, since the wood never gets really dry. The vessel elements are relatively small and usually di- to quadriseriate; the medullary rays are fine and close together. Pouteria woods are capable of attaining an excellent polish using fine-grained sandpaper and possibly some wax. They can sometimes show an attractive figure of dark stripes against a sandy to mid-brown background colour. However, the wood is hardly used for furniture because it is so dense that items made from it would be difficult to transport. Moreover, it is nearly impossible to work using hand tools. Even using power tools, working these woods presents some problems, as well, but given some patience and practical knowledge, these can easily be solved. For the silica to be effective against shipworms, it needs to dry to some degree to harden. When the wood is continually waterlogged, this process may take place very slowly or not at all, leaving the wood vulnerable. Pouteria foliage is used as food by some Lepidoptera caterpillars, including those of the dalcerid moth Dalcera abrasa, which has been recorded on P. ramiflora. The fruits are important food for various animals, such as the rock-haunting ringtail possum (Petropseudes dahli). Due to habitat loss and in some cases overexploitation, many species of Pouteria are threatened. At least 10 are close to extinction, and one - the Rio de Janeiro pouteria (P. stenophylla), which grew near Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, is now extinct.  Systematics and taxonomy  Pouteria is a \\"wastebasket taxon\\", and its size is continually being expanded or decreased. The segregate Labatia, described by Olof Swartz in 1788 and named after the French botanist Jean-Baptiste Labat, was maintained as a distinct entity until the 1930s, when it was finally synonymized with Pouteria for good. Most segregated genera that were eventually merged with Pouteria again were established by Henri Ernest Baillon and Jean Baptiste Louis Pierre.USDA (2009) = Selected species = * Pouteria adolfi-friedericii * Pouteria altissima * Pouteria amapaensis * Pouteria amygdalina * Pouteria andarahiensis * Pouteria anteridata * Pouteria arcuata * Pouteria areolatifolia * Pouteria arguacoensium * Pouteria aristata * Pouteria arnhemica (F.Muell. ex Benth.)

Musical style Their musical style is a mixture of death metal elements, such as double bass drumming and heavy guitar riffing, and more mellow, progressive, gothic metal and doom metal elements. Singer Manuel Munoz varies between harsh growls and a melodic tenor voice. Albums Their first major album release in 2003 was entitled The Nameless Disease and was inspired by and centered around the suicide of the band's first drummer, Fr√©d√©ric Guillemot. Their second album The Perpetual Motion was released in 2005. Their latest record to date is The Water Fields which was released in September 2007. It received critical acclaim. A new album was tentatively scheduled to be recorded in Fall 2009, but creative differences caused the band to break up before it could be finished. In 2013, in order to celebrate the 10th anniversary of The Nameless Disease, Manuel, Nicolas, Gilles and Raphael reunited to perform the album in its entirety on a series of live shows, including at Hellfest.

Early life Sereni was born in Rome. His father was physician to the King of Italy. He grew up in a traditional Jewish Italian household but became a Zionist as a teenager and was one of the first Italian Zionists. Zionist activity After obtaining his PhD in philosophy from the University of Rome, he emigrated to Mandate Palestine in 1927. He worked in orange groves in Rehovot and soon helped found kibbutz Givat Brenner. As an enthusiastic socialist, Sereni was also active in the Histadrut trade union. He was a pacifist who advocated co-existence with the Arabs and integration of Jewish and Arab society. Sereni was sent to Europe in 1931‚Äì1934 to help bring people to Palestine through the Youth Aliyah, and was arrested briefly by the Gestapo. He helped to organize the Hechalutz movement in Nazi Germany and was also involved in helping to smuggle money and people out of Germany. Sereni was also sent to the United States to help organize the Zionist movement there. During World War II, he joined the British Army, and was involved in disseminating anti-fascist propaganda in Egypt. The British sent him to Iraq, and Sereni spent part of his time organizing clandestine aliyah. In 1942, Sereni became one of the first Jewish emissaries from Palestine to Iraq and visited Sandur, a Jewish village in northern Iraq and described it in detail. The village was located an hour and a half's drive from Mosul, in a valley between two walls of rock. It was completely green and \\"full of gardens of fruit, pears, grapes, plums, pomegranates, apples.\\" Sereni got in trouble with his British superior officers for his Zionist views and was imprisoned briefly for forging passports. Sereni then helped organize the Jewish parachute unit of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) that sent agents into occupied Europe. Of about 250 volunteer trainees, about 110 were selected for training, and 33 were actually parachuted into Europe, including Sereni, despite his relatively advanced age. On 15 May 1944 he was parachuted into Northern Italy but was captured immediately. According to records, he was shot in Dachau concentration camp on 18 November 1944.Enzo Serini Cenopath CWGC memorial Other famous martyrs who parachuted into Europe with this unit include Hannah Szenes and Haviva Reik. Kibbutz Netzer Sereni is named after him, as are many streets throughout Israel. Sereni wrote several books and numerous articles.

Coombe, 449 F.3d 371 (2d Cir. 2006), was a legal challenge to New York State‚Äôs law disenfranchising individuals convicted of felonies while in prison and on parole. The plaintiff, Jalil Abdul Muntaqim who is serving a life sentence, argues that the law has a disproportionate impact on African Americans and therefore violates Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act as a denial of the right to vote on account of race. Overview Muntaqim's original name was Anthony Bottom. In May 1971, Bottom and an accomplice shot and killed two New York City police officers. In 1974, Bottom was convicted on two counts of murder in the first degree for these killings, and received a prison term of twenty-five years to life. Bottom was denied parole in 2004 and is eligible to apply again for parole in 2006. Because he is serving a life term, Bottom would never again be allowed to vote under New York's existing felon-disenfranchisement law unless he were to be pardoned. Bottom's challenge to New York's felon disenfranchisement law was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The United States Court of Appeals affirmed dismissal of the complaint on the grounds that section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not apply to felon disenfranchisement statutes. This was based on the fact that since the application of Section 2 would have altered the balance of power between the state and federal governments, Congress was obliged, under recent Supreme Court precedent, to make a clear statement that it intended to upset that balance. As it had not done so, the statute could not be applied to disallow felon disenfranchisement. On November 8, 2004 the Supreme Court denied Bottom's petition for certiorari, thus declining to hear the case.. After the Supreme Court denied certiorari, the Second Circuit on its own motion ordered rehearing of the case before the full court. The oral argument on rehearing took place on June 22, 2005. On May 4, 2006 the Second Circuit dismissed Muntaqim's complaint on the grounds that he lacked standing and the court, therefore, lacked jurisdiction to hear him. Muntaqim had been transferred to a NY prison directly from a California prison in which he had been serving a sentence for a different offense. As such, he was then a citizen of California and not of NY. Further, at various parole hearings he had indicated that he had no intention of staying in NY were he to be released. Since, under NY law, serving in prison neither creates nor destroys residency, Muntaqim remained a resident of California and it was that fact, not the felon disenfranchisement law, which prevented Muntaqim from voting. Procedural history On September 26, 1994, acting as his own lawyer (pro se), Muntaqim filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. This made a number of constitutional and civil rights complaints, among them the Voting Rights Act allegation. On October 25, 1999, the defendants moved for summary judgment, asking that the complaint be dismissed on the basis of the pleadings (in effect a motion to dismiss or demurrer). This motion was referred to a magistrate judge. On July 18, 2000, the magistrate judge filed a report and recommendation that defendants' motion be granted and Muntaqim's complaint dismissed in its entirety. Muntaqim objected. On January 24, 2001, the District Court judge accepted the recommendation and dismissed Muntaqim's complaint. Muntaqim appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but only as to the dismissal of the Voting Rights Act allegation. On June 4, 2002, the Circuit Court, of its own volition (sua sponte) appointed appellate counsel to assist Muntaqim. On March 10, 2003 the case was argued before a panel of three judges of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. On April 23, 2004, the Circuit Court affirmed the District Court's decision. Muntaqim applied to the US Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to have it hear his case. On October 1, 2004, a judge of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals asked that a poll be taken of his or her fellow judges to see if the case should be reheard by all of the judges of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals (rehearing en banc). The poll failed. On November 8, 2004, the Supreme Court declined to hear Muntaqim's case (writ of certiorari denied). On December 29, 2004, another poll of the Second Circuit judges was taken, and this time rehearing en banc was granted. On March 11, 2005, the Circuit Court ordered that Muntaqim's case be consolidated and heard together with a similar case, Hayden v. Pataki. On June 22, 2005, the case was argued before the en banc panel. On May 4, 2006, the case was dismissed on the grounds that Muntaqim lacked standing. Second Circuit opinion The appeal was heard by Judges Meskill, Cardamone and Cabranes. The unanimous opinion was written by Judge Cabranes. The court determined that the controlling precedent was what it called the \\"Supreme Court's 'super-strong clear statement rule'\\" 366 F.3d 115. Under this doctrine, if Congress intends to alter the balance between federal and state authority, it is required to make an unmistakably clear statement to that effect. In order to determine if an alteration of that balance has occurred, the court then had to determine what conduct is, in fact, prohibited by Section 1973. The court determined that those provisions were intended to dispense with the requirement that a challenged law be the result of demonstrable racial animus on the legislator's part, but that they still required that there be some causal connection between discrimination and disparity. Since Muntaqim had averred such a connection (and since the procedural posture of the case obliged the court to assume the truth of what he averred), the court determined that he had stated a cognizable VRA claim. The court then turned to the question of whether Section 1973 affected an alteration in the federal/state balance. The court determined that both punishment of felons and control of the franchise were matters of traditional state concern. The court then determined that, in the absence of findings that disenfranchisement laws were a tool of discrimination or that application of Section 1973 to disenfranchisement laws was a proportionate and congruent response to unconstitutional behavior that application of Section 1973 to felon disenfranchisement laws might well be unconstitutional and, at a minimum, altered the federal/state balance. Having made that determination, the court determined Congress had not made the clear statement required of it and that Section 1973 did not apply to New York's felon disenfranchisement statute.

She hires an upmarket prostitute, who works as a hairdresser, to seduces her husband and tell her the details of their meetings. She asks the girl to play a character for this and to be called Nathalie. Nathalie accepts and a very ambiguous relationship is created between the two women. Nathalie uses very crude words to describe her meetings with Bernard. Many times the contract between the two women is broken (because it goes too far or because Catherine is no longer sure of what she wants) but each time Catherine relaunches the relationship. The two women get so close that when Nathalie finds herself homeless, Catherine finds her new accommodation, she also introduces Nathalie to her mother. The relationship is complicated when Nathalie, still playing her role, announces to Catherine that Bernard wants to live with her. Catherine asks for explanations from her husband who swears that he has no other woman in his life. Perplexed, Catherine leads Bernard into the bistro which is her meeting place with Nathalie.

Reik went to Slovakia in fall 1944 and worked with local Jewish people to resist the German occupation there. She established a camp for Russian prisoners of war who had escaped, and helped organize a Jewish resistance unit. The Germans organized forces to put down the Jewish resistance, and Reik and the other parachutists escaped with about 40 local Jews into the mountains. In November 1944, however, Reik and the other parachutists were captured, killed, and buried in a mass grave. Biography Reik was born June 22, 1914 as Marta Reick in the Slovakian village of Nadabula (now a part of Ro≈æ≈àava), and grew up in Bansk√° Bystrica in the Carpathian Mountains. She joined the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement there. In 1939 she made aliyah‚Äîemigrated to Palestine‚Äîwhere she joined kibbutz Ma'anit and later enlisted in the Palmach, the elite strike force of the Haganah underground military organization. In 1942, the Jewish Agency Defense Department formed a plan to send Jews from Palestine to act as agents in Nazi- controlled territories and work with Jewish communities there. The British needed people who spoke the languages of the occupied countries and were familiar with the land and culture. The British Special Operations Executive (SOE) asked the Palmach if they could supply people with the right qualities for special operations and with a prior knowledge of Central Europe. The call was open to women as well as men; Reik was one of those accepted. She joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), serving as 2992503 ACW.2 \\"Ada Robinson\\". She then joined SOE for specialist training, including a parachuting course. She was promoted to Sergeant. Reik was married but separated; her name on her British documents was listed as Martha Martinovich. =Operation in Slovakia= The mission, parachuting into Nazi-controlled territory, was highly secret and extremely dangerous; before the operation Reik told friends that she was not sure she would ever return. An uprising was in progress at the time in her native Slovakia against the Axis-installed Hlinkova Slovensk√° ƒΩudov√° Strana (Slovak People's Party of Hlinka; HSLS). Centered around the Bansk√° Bystrica region, the revolt had begun in the spring of 1944, initiated by the Czechoslovak Agrarian party, part of the Social Democratic party, the Communist party, sectors of the Slovak nationalists, and army officers. In late December 1943 these groups had aligned with the Slovak National Council. The uprising sought to overthrow the German collaborationist government and detach Slovakia from the Axis. Reik with other Jewish Paratroopers; from right to left, top row: Reuven Dafni, Zadok Doron, . Bottom row: Sara Braverman, Arieh Fichman, Haviva Reik There were armed underground Jewish cells in each of the three Slovak labor camps before the SNR was established. Early in 1944 they established contact with the SNR, and became part of the movement. The uprising was to coincide with Allied advances, particularly that of the Soviet Army. However, the Red Army held back. The partisans made considerable gains, and on August 28 the Nazis decided to occupy Slovakia and eliminate the uprising. Reik and the other members of her group received training in parachuting in Palestine. The first time she was to jump from an airplane, she had an injured hand from earlier training, and her trainers were concerned it might not be strong enough to manage the parachute; however she did make the jump with little apparent concern. After their training, Reik and her group were transported to Cairo to await departure for the mission. On the night of 14 September 1944, , , and , parachuted into Slovakia; the jump was dubbed \\"Operation Amsterdam\\". Reik had planned to join the jump but British authorities refused to allow her to‚Äîthey knew the Germans had copies of their standing orders prohibiting female soldiers to cross enemy lines, so they thought if she were captured she would almost certainly be executed as a spy rather than taken prisoner as a soldier. Haim Hermesh later remembered that Reik burst into tears and said, \\"what will become of me? ... We promised that all four of us would go together!\\" The three male parachutists landed safely and made their way in a few days to Bansk√° Bystrica‚Äîand were surprised to find Reik already there waiting for them, working with the local Jews. Four days after they had jumped, Reik had joined a group of American and British officers who were landing in Slovakia in what was called Operation Leadburn. At the end of the month, a fifth parachutist, , joined them, bringing radio equipment. In Bansk√° Bystrica, Haviva and the others engaged in relief and rescue activities. Reik helped organize various Jewish groups into a resistance, settling disputes among them and lending financial and other assistance. They also aimed to help Jews escape to Palestine. The group organized a soup kitchen and community centre for refugees, and facilitated the escape of Jewish children to Hungary and from there to Palestine. Through their connections with partisan and resistance groups, they helped rescue allied airmen who had been shot down. =Capture= The Germans organized large numbers of soldiers to put down the Jewish resistance. Late in September, SS Obergruppenfuhrer Gottlob Berger, the chief commander of the German forces, was replaced by the Obergruppenfuhrer of the Hoherer SS and the Polizeifuhrer SS, Hermann Hofle. They used Ukrainian Waffen SS troops, among them apparently John (Ivan) Demjanjuk, to suppress the rebellion. On 23 October 1944, the Germans were advancing, and Reik's group decided to escape Bansk√° Bystrica for the village of Pohronsk√Ω Bukovec. Haviva and the other parachutists escaped with about 40 Jews of varying ages from the area and built a camp in the mountains. The Germans overran the camp and captured Reik, Reiss, and Ben-Yaakov. Reik and Reiss were killed on 20 November in the village of Kremniƒçka near Bansk√° Bystrica, as part of the . They were buried in a mass grave in the village. Abba Berdiczew was deported to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp and later killed. Haim Hermesh escaped, fought with the partisans and the Red Army, and later returned to Palestine. Commemoration Tombstone of Haviva Reik After the war, on September 1945, Reik's and Reiss' bodies were exhumed and buried in the Military Cemetery in Prague. On 10 September 1952, Haviva Reik's remains were buried in Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem, along with those of Szenes and Reiss.

She has been co- chairperson of The Left since 2012, alongside Bernd Riexinger.  Early life and career  Kipping was born on 18 January 1978 in Dresden, then part of East Germany (GDR). After completing her Abitur in 1996 at Annen-Gymnasium, Kipping spent a voluntary social year in Gatchina, Russia. Following this, she completed a degree in Slavic studies, with a minor in American studies and public law, at the Dresden University of Technology, from which she obtained her Master of Arts degree in 2003. Kipping currently splits her time between Berlin and Dresden.S√§chsische Zeitung vom 28. Dezember 2012 She is married, and has a daughter.  Political career  At the start of her studies at the Dresden University of Technology, Kipping was heavily involved with the so- called Protestb√ºro (bureau of protest). In 1998, she became a member of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the forerunner of today's Left party. She was elected to the city council of Dresden, capital of Saxony, serving from 1999 to 2003. She was elected to the Landtag of Saxony for PDS in the 1999 state election, and served until the 2004 election. During this time, she was the party's spokesperson for traffic and energy policy. In July 2003, she became deputy chairperson of PDS, focusing on the party's \\"social agenda\\" and \\"contact with social movements\\". She was a principal proponent of a united left party, comprising the east-oriented PDS and the west-oriented Labour and Social Justice (WASG). In 2005, Kipping was elected to the Bundestag, on the joint PDS‚ÄìWASG electoral list. The two parties merged to form The Left on 16 June 2007, and Kipping was elected deputy chairperson of the new party. In 2009, she was re-elected to the Bundestag, on The Left's list. In January 2012, Der Spiegel reported that Kipping was one of 27 members of The Left's parliamentary group who were under surveillance by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Verfassungsschutz). On 2 June 2012, delegates at the third national party conference elected her as one of the party's two chairpersons, with 67% of the vote.

He was best known for his Olmec alternative origin speculations, a brand of pre-Columbian contact theory, which he proposed in his book They Came Before Columbus (1976). While his Olmec theory has \\"spread widely in African American community, both lay and scholarly\\", it was mostly ignored in Mesoamericanist scholarship, and dismissed as Afrocentric pseudoarchaeology and pseudohistory to the effect of \\"robbing native American cultures\\".Ivan Gladstone Van Sertima Early life Van Sertima was born in Kitty Village, near Georgetown, in what was then the colony of British Guiana (present-day Guyana); he retained his British citizenship throughout his life. He completed primary and secondary school in Guyana, and started writing poetry. He attended the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at the University of London from 1959. In addition to his creative writing, Van Sertima completed his undergraduate studies in African languages and literature at SOAS in 1969, where he graduated with honours. From 1957 to 1959, worked as a Press and Broadcasting Officer in the Guyana Information Services. During the 1960s, he worked for several years in Great Britain as a journalist, doing weekly broadcasts to the Caribbean and Africa. Van Sertima married Maria Nagy in 1964; they adopted two sons, Larry and Michael. In doing field work in Africa, he compiled a dictionary of Swahili legal terms in 1967.\\"Van Sertima, Giant Scholar, Dies at 74\\", Black Star News, 30 May 2009. In 1970 Van Sertima immigrated to the United States, where he entered Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, for graduate work. After divorcing his first wife, Sertima remarried in 1984, to Jacqueline L. Patten, who had two daughters. Published work He published his They Came Before Columbus in 1976, as a Rutgers graduate student. The book deals mostly with his arguments for an African origin of Mesoamerican culture in the Western Hemisphere. Published by Random House rather than an academic press, They Came Before Columbus was a best-sellerReece, Maggie (14 January 2012), \\"Ivan Van-Sertima - Anthropologist, linguist, educator and author\\", Guyana Graphic. and achieved widespread attention within the African-American community for his claims of prehistoric African contact and diffusion of culture in Central and South America. It was generally \\"ignored or dismissed\\" by academic experts at the time and strongly criticised in detail in an academic journal, Current Anthropology, in 1997. Van Sertima completed his master's degree at Rutgers in 1977. He became Associate Professor of African Studies at Rutgers in the Department of Africana Studies in 1979. Also in 1979, Van Sertima founded the Journal of African Civilizations, which he exclusively edited and published for decades. He published several annual compilations, volumes of the journal dealing with various topics of African history. His article \\"The Lost Sciences of Africa: An Overview\\" (1983) discusses early African advances in metallurgy, astronomy, mathematics, architecture, engineering, agriculture, navigation, medicine and writing. He posited that higher learning, in Africa as elsewhere, was the preserve of elites in the centres of civilisations, rendering them vulnerable in the event of the destruction of those centres and the loss of such knowledge. Van Sertima also discussed African scientific contributions in an essay for the volume African Renaissance, published in 1999 (he had first published the essay in 1983). This was a record of the conference held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in September 1998 on the theme of the African Renaissance. On 7 July 1987, Van Sertima testified before a United States Congressional committee to oppose recognition of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's \\"discovery\\" of the Americas. He said, \\"You cannot really conceive of how insulting it is to Native Americans ... to be told they were 'discovered'.\\" Reception Van Sertima's work on Olmec civilization has been criticised by Mesoamerican academics,See Grove (1976) or Ortiz de Montellano (1997). who describe his claims to be ill-founded and false. Van Sertima's Journal of African Civilizations was not considered for inclusion in Journals of the Century. In 1997 academics in a Journal of Current Anthropology article criticised in detail many elements of They Came Before Columbus (1976). Except for a brief mention, the book had not previously been reviewed in an academic journal. The researchers wrote a systematic rebuttal of Van Sertima's claims, stating that Van Sertima's \\"proposal was without foundation\\" in claiming African diffusion as responsible for prehistoric Olmec culture (in present-day Mexico). They noted that no \\"genuine African artifact had been found in a controlled archaeological excavation in the New World.\\" They noted that Olmec stone heads were carved hundreds of years prior to the claimed contact and only superficially appear to be African; the Nubians whom Van Sertima had claimed as their originators do not resemble these \\"portraits\\". They further noted that in the 1980s, Van Sertima had changed his timeline of African influence, suggesting that Africans made their way to the New World in the 10th century B.C., to account for more recent independent scholarship in the dating of Olmec culture. They further called \\"fallacious\\" his claims that Africans had diffused the practices of pyramid building and mummification, and noted the independent rise of these in the Americas. Additionally, they wrote that Van Sertima \\"diminishe[d] the real achievements of Native American culture\\" by his claims of African origin for them. Van Sertima wrote a response to be included in the article (as is standard academic practice) but withdrew it. The journal required that reprints must include the entire article and would have had to include the original authors' response (written but not published) to his response. Instead, Van Sertima replied to his critics in \\"his\\" journal volume published as Early America Revisited (1998).Ivan Van Sertima, Early America Revisited, Journal of African Civilizations, New Jersey: Transaction Publishers, 1998, pp. 143‚Äì52. In a New York Times 1977 review of Van Sertima's 1976 book They Came Before Columbus, the archaeologist Glyn Daniel labelled Van Sertima's work as \\"ignorant rubbish\\", and concluded that the works of Van Sertima, and Barry Fell, whom he was also reviewing, \\"give us badly argued theories based on fantasies\\". In response to Daniel's review Clarence Weiant, who had worked as an assistant archaeologist specialising in ceramics at Tres Zapotes and later pursued a career as a chiropractor, wrote a letter to the New York Times supporting Van Sertima's work. Weiant wrote: \\"Van Sertima's work is a summary of six or seven years of meticulous research based upon archaeology, egyptology, African history, oceanography, astronomy, botany, rare Arabic and Chinese manuscripts, the letters and journals of early American explorers, and the observations of physical anthropologists.... As one who has been immersed in Mexican archaeology for some forty years, and who participated in the excavation of the first giant heads, I must confess, I am thoroughly convinced of the soundness of Van Sertima's conclusions.\\"Dr. Clarence Weiant Letter to the New York Times, 1 May 1977. In 1981 Dean R. Snow, a professor of anthropology, wrote that Van Sertima \\"uses the now familiar technique of stringing together bits of carefully selected evidence, each surgically removed from the context that would give it a rational explanation\\". Snow continued, \\"The findings of professional archaeologists and physical anthropologists are misrepresented so that they seem to support the [Van Sertima] hypothesis\\".Dean R.

The road is part of the E30 European route and a short section is also part of the E01 European route. It forms part of the proposed Atlantic Corridor route. Route Up to 22 February 2012, the Cork South Ring Road was designated as part of the N25. However, on 23 February, this section of road was redesignated as N40 and hence from this date, the N25 now commences at the Dunkettle Interchange.http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0053.html From the Dunkettle Interchange the N25 commences east as the East Cork Parkway dual- carriageway, with interchanges for Fota Island and C√≥bh, and also Carrigtwohill. The next major destination on the route is Midleton. N25 Waterford City bypass The dual-carriageway ends after bypassing Midleton with an ordinary two-lane road continuing east to Youghal. At Youghal a single carriageway bypass was completed in 2003, bringing the road around the west of the town to the northern side of Youghal. Here the road crosses the River Blackwater into County Waterford. Northeast of this, the road was widened as part of the N25 Kinsalebeg project. This consisted of widening of 3.5 kilometers of single carriageway to include a hard shoulder on both sides of the road. The route passes Dungarvan, with a future bypass at preliminary design stage, before reaching Kilmeaden west of Waterford city and onto the Waterford City Bypass. Beginning at Kilmeaden the bypass passes the Woodstown historic settlement, before crossing the River Suir (via a cable stay bridge of about 475m in length) between Gracedieu in County Waterford and Grannagh in County Kilkenny. The bypass meets the M9 Motorway and N24 at the Grannagh interchange, before joining the old N25 east of Slieverue. The bypass connects to the Outer Ring Road and the old N25 via a road known as the Western Link. (The bypass as a whole contains of dual carriageway* and of single carriageway.) The bypass is a tolled road. From Waterford, the N25 moves north to cross the River Barrow into County Wexford further up its estuary bypassing New Ross over Ireland's longest bridge, the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Bridge, since 29 January 2020. East of the town, the N30 diverges and connects northeast to Enniscorthy on the M11 Dublin - Wexford motorway. The N25 continues east to Wexford and meets the end of the N11 road west of the town. The N25 skirts the edge of the town around to the south and passes west of Rosslare to reach Rosslare Harbour. Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Bridge, New Ross bypass Future developments Other sections of the route may become motorway. Part of the N25 dual carriageway in Midleton is to have all its junctions grade-separated and all direct accesses removed from the route (by the construction of a parallel road), thus making it suitable for upgrade to motorway status. TII is examining the possibility of a new road from Midleton to Youghal, with route options being investigated. As part of the Atlantic Corridor road scheme the section of road between Waterford and Rosslare Europort will be built as high quality dual carriageway or motorway standard. Some parts are currently in planning and design stages.http://www.transport21.ie/Projects/Roads/N25_Rosslare_to_Waterford.html However, due to deterioration of the Irish economy and the scaling back of the road building programme the proposed 2015 completion date on these projects was not possible. Light aircraft crash On 27 March 2017, a light aircraft crashed in a field adjacent to the road, killing the elderly pilot. It was one of three major aviation incidents involving Ireland in March 2017, with the Coastguard and Wales crash.

Publication history The Trident Trio first appeared in New Teen Titans #33 and were created by Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez. Marv Wolfman later acknowledged that he recycled the idea of different people posing as a single villain from his earlier characters the Brothers Grimm. Fictional character biographyTrident Trio= In the story, the three alter-egos of Trident were operatives of the H.I.V.E. who later splintered from the group. \\"Prof\\" was a weapons design specialist. Sammy Jaye was an enforcer. The third one was an unidentified black man that used to fight in the Golden Gloves. Eventually, they decide to team up and strike out on their own. Each adopts the costume and code-name of Trident, and each is armed with a powerful trident. The trident's right tine shoots fire, the left tine shoots ice, and the center tine releases a blast of devastating force. Trident operates in New York City, each criminal taking turns at committing several large robberies, leading the public to believe them to be a single person. Eventually, the Sammy Jaye Trident tries to cheat his two partners out of their share of loot. The other two kill Sammy and his costumed body is discovered by the Teen Titans and the police. Starfire eventually figures out that there is more than one Trident. After tracking down the other two Tridents, the Teen Titans defeated the Tridents and they were handed over to the police.New Teen Titans #33 Some time after the two surviving Tridents are imprisoned, Wildebeest springs the unnamed Trident, Gizmo, Puppeteer, and Disruptor from jail. These villains are eventually recaptured by the Teen Titans.New Teen Titans #41-42 During the Infinite Crisis storyline, someone that might be the unnamed Trident was seen on the Injustice Gang's satellite as a member of Alexander Luthor Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains.Teen Titans/Outsiders Secret Files and Origins #2005 =Karate Kid= The name Trident was also used by a Starro-infected Karate Kid who claimed to be a member of the Trident Guild. However, these beliefs were due to the effects of brainwashing by Starro.Justice League of America Vol. 2 #3 Powers and abilities Trident carries a trident that has three tines: the right shoots fire, the left shoots ice, and the middle releases a blast of devastating force. He can project holograms which make him appear several feet away from where he is actually standing while concealing his true position. In other mediaTelevision= Trident appears in Teen Titans voiced by Clancy Brown. This version of Trident is depicted as an extremely arrogant fish-man and is an enemy of the Atlanteans. He intended to overthrow Atlantis and take over the surface world by making an army of clones of himself using toxic chemicals. He was attacked by the Teen Titans in their T-Sub, accompanied by the Atlantian superhero Aqualad. His own ego, however, thwarted his plans when Beast Boy and Aqualad enticed his entire clone army to turn on each other, and they were soon afterwards buried in an undersea cave by the Titans. Trident later reappeared as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil. He takes down Aqualad with help from Plasmus in \\"Calling All Titans.\\" In \\"Titans Together,\\" Trident is defeated in with the rest of the Brotherhood of Evil.

The equivalence postulate states that all one-particle systems can be connected by a non- degenerate coordinate transformation, more precisely by a map over the cotangent bundle of the position manifold, so that there exists a quantum action function S(q) that transforms as a scalar field. Here, the action defined as :d S(q) = p_i(q) dq^i is the canonical one-form. This property lies at the heart of the EP formulation of quantum mechanics. An immediate consequence of the EP is the removal of the rest frame. The theory is based on symmetry properties of the Schwarzian derivative and on the quantum stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation (QSHJE), which is a partial differential equation for the quantum action function S(q). This quantum version of the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equations differs from the classical one by the presence of a quantum potential term :Q(q) = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{4m}\\\\\\\\{S(q),q\\\\\\\\} where \\\\\\\\{,\\\\\\\\} denotes the Schwarzian derivative. The QSHJE can be demonstrated to imply the Schr√∂dinger equation with square-summability of the wave function, and thus quantization of energy, due to continuity conditions of the quantum potential, without any assumption on the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function. The theory, which is a work in progress, may or may not include probabilistic interpretation as a consequence OR a hidden variable description of trajectories.  References  * Alon E. Faraggi, M.

It is a bird predator, with strong talons that enable it to catch prey in flight, and is considered by some ‚Äì such as the German-Brazilian ornithologist Helmut Sick ‚Äì as filling the ecological niche of the peregrine falcon as a breeding species in tropical America. The orange-breasted falcon, however, seems to favor more heavily wooded habitats than the peregrine, therefore the species does not seem to be in ecological competition with peregrine falcons wintering or breeding in South America. Living in the predominately tropical climates of Guatemala and Belize, these birds use the humidity of their niche to their advantage.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball between and , most notably as a member of the Detroit Tigers team that won two consecutive American League pennants in and and won the 1935 World Series. He was employed in professional baseball for nearly 50 years from 1926 to 1973. A native of High Point, North Carolina, Hayworth played professional baseball for 15 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Detroit Tigers (1929‚Äì1938), Brooklyn Dodgers (1939, 1944‚Äì1945), New York Giants (1939), and St. Louis Browns (1942). He posted a .265 career batting average with five home runs and 238 RBIs in 699 games played. A strong defensive catcher, he set an American League record by handling 438 total chances as a catcher without an error. Following his playing career, Hayworth managed the Fort Worth Cats in 1946 and Macon Peaches in 1947. He also scouted the Negro Leagues for Branch Rickey and the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946 and then continued scouting for more than 25 years for the Chicago Cubs (1947‚Äì1959), the Milwaukee and Atlanta Braves (1960‚Äì1970), and the Montreal Expos (1971‚Äì1973).  Early years  Hayworth was born in 1904 in High Point, North Carolina. He grew up as one of nine children in a Quaker family raised in a Quaker settlement south of High Point. His father had a tobacco and cotton farm and operated a store. He began playing baseball in grade school. He and three of his brothers played baseball. His brother Red Hayworth also played in the major leagues. Hayworth was a pitcher in high school and began playing catcher at the Oak Ridge Military Academy in Oak Ridge, North Carolina.  Professional baseballDetroit Tigers= In January 1926, Hayworth was discovered at Oak Ridge by Detroit Tigers' scout Billy Doyle. Doyle signed Hayworth for $250.Wilson, Voices from the Pastime, p. 47. He began the 1926 season with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League, but he was called up when Johnny Bassler broke his leg and then Larry Woodall was also injured with a spike wound in his knee.Interview of Ray Hayworth by Eugene C. Murdock, at 9:10‚Äì10:30. He ended up playing 12 games for the 1926 Tigers, compiling a .233 batting average. Ty Cobb was Hayworth's manager in 1926. He spent the 1927 and 1928 seasons in the minor leagues, playing for the Nashville Volunteers of the Southern Association and the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League. He hit a career-high 13 home runs with Shreveport in 1928. He began the 1929 season with the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association where he played 73 games and hit for a career-high .330 batting average under manager Casey Stengel. Hayworth later recalled that Stengel influenced him more than anyone else.Wilson, Voices from the Pastime, p. 50. Hayworth was recalled by the Tigers later in the 1929 season and appeared in 14 games, hitting for a .256 average. He remained with the Tigers for nearly a decade through the start of the 1938 season. He received significant playing time with 77 games 1930, 88 games in 1931, 109 games in 1932, and 134 games in 1933. Hayworth led the American League with 11 passed balls in 1930, but he quickly established himself as one of the best defensive catchers in the American League from 1931 to 1933. He set an American League record for the most consecutive chances by a catcher without an error at 439, over a span of 97 games from September 2, 1931, to August 29, 1932. The previous record was set by Johnny Bassler with 285 chances.Interview of Ray Hayworth by Eugene C. Murdock, at 30:00‚Äì32:00. In 1932, Hayworth hit .293 and ranked among the league's top catchers with a .991 fielding percentage (second), 59 assists (third), a 4.99 range factor per nine innings (third), 399 putouts (fourth), 31 runners caught stealing (fourth), and eight double plays turned (fifth). He ranked among the leaders again in 1933 with a .994 fielding percentage (second), 44 runners caught stealing (second), a 5.33 range factor per nine innings (second), 546 putouts (third), 79 assists (third), and 14 double plays turned (third). On December 12, 1933, the Tigers acquired Hall of Fame catcher Mickey Cochrane in a trade with the Philadelphia Athletics. With Cochrane's arrival, Hayworth's playing time was reduced to 54 games in 1934 and 51 games in 1935. The Tigers won the American League pennant in both of those seasons with Cochrane as player-manager. Despite the limited playing time, Hayworth hit .293 in 1934 and .309 in 1935. Hayworth attributed his higher average in 1934 and 1935 to having Cochrane facing right-handed pitchers and leaving Hayworth to face only left-handed pitchers.Interview of Ray Hayworth by Eugene C. Murdock, at 36:50‚Äì37:09. Cochrane suffered a nervous breakdown during the 1936 season, and Hayworth was called on to catch 81 games. He led the league's catchers with a .988 fielding percentage in 1936. Rudy York became the Tigers' starting catcher in 1937, and Hayworth was limited to 30 games in 1937 and eight games in 1938. =Brooklyn, New York and St. Louis= On September 14, 1938, Hayworth was selected off waivers by the Brooklyn Dodgers from the Tigers. He appeared in 26 games for the Dodgers in 1938 and 1939. On September 9, 1939, the Dodgers sent Hayworth to the New York Giants in exchange for $6,000 and in completion of another deal made two days earlier. He appeared in only five games for the Giants and was released on December 4, 1940. Hayworth signed with the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association in the spring of 1941. He appeared in 40 games for the Brewers, but was released at the end of June. Hayworth next signed with the St. Louis Browns as a free agent in March 1942. He appeared in only one game and was given an unconditional release in mid-May. He finished the 1942 season playing for the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. In February 1944, Hayworth signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers who needed an insurance policy in case the team's regular catchers were called to wartime duty. Hayworth remained with the Dodgers in 1944 and 1945 but appeared in only nine games. Interviewed by The Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1944, Hayworth said he intended to keep playing until his knees \\"buckle under me,\\" adding: \\"Baseball is full of regrets when you come down to your last innings. Just when you learn how to play it one morning you wake up with a crick in your knee and you realize you're washed up. It would be great turn back the clock on the outfield wall 10 years. But I guess the same thing could be said of life, too.\\" =Managerial and scouting career= In December 1945, Brooklyn Dodgers president Branch Rickey hired Hayworth to take over as manager of the club's Texas League affiliate, the Fort Worth Cats. Hayworth coached at Fort Worth during the 1946 season and also worked as a scout for Rickey and the Dodgers in the Negro Leagues.Wilson, Voices from the Pastime, p. 54. In 1947, Hayworth became manager of the Macon Peaches, a Chicago Cubs affiliate. He went on to scout for the Cubs from 1947 to 1959, serving as the club's chief of scouting operations in 1959. He later scouted for the Milwaukee and Atlanta Braves (1960‚Äì1970) and the Montreal Expos (1971‚Äì1973).Interview of Ray Hayworth by Eugene C. Murdock, at 1:07:00‚Äì1:08:00. He scouted Ernie Banks for the Cubs and arranged to buy Banks' contract for $22,000.Interview of Ray Hayworth by Eugene C. Murdock, at 1:14:10‚Äì1:17:01.Wilson, Voices from the Pastime, pp. 54‚Äì55. Family and later years Hayworth was married in 1927 to Virginia Jones.Wilson, Voices from the Pastime, p. 53. They two sons, Raymond Jr. and John D. His grandson, J. D. Hayworth, was a Republican Party member of the United States House of Representatives from Arizona. In 2002, Hayworth died in Salisbury, North Carolina, at age of 98. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former major league player.[Deathwatch] Ray Hayworth, oldest surviving major league player, 98 He was buried at Guilford Memorial Park in Greensboro, North Carolina.

A map of England (dark red) within the United Kingdom (light red) English nationalism is the nationalism that asserts that the English are a nation and promotes the cultural unity of English people. In a general sense, it comprises political and social movements and sentiment inspired by a love for English culture, language and history, and a sense of pride in England and the English people. English nationalists often see themselves as predominantly English rather than British. On the political level, some English nationalists have advocated self-government for England such as the English Democrats. This could take the form either of a devolved English parliament within the United Kingdom or the re-establishment of an independent sovereign state of England outside of the United Kingdom. History The history of English nationalism is a contested area of scholarship. The historian Adrian Hastings has written that: \\"One can find historians to date 'the dawn of English national consciousness' (or some such phrase) in almost every century from the eighth to the nineteenth\\".Adrian Hastings, The Construction of Nationhood. Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 35. =Anglo-Saxon= The Venerable Bede Patrick Wormald has claimed that England was a nation by the time of the Venerable Bede, who wrote the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (Ecclesiastical History of the English People) around 730.Patrick Wormald, 'The Venerable Bede and the \\"Church of the English\\"', Geoffrey Rowell (ed.), The English Religious Tradition and the Genius of Anglicanism (Wantage: Ikon, 1992), p. 26. Wormald attributes Bede with a decisive \\"role in defining English national identity and English national destiny\\".Wormald, p. 26. Bede uses the label \\"English\\" to describe the Germanic peoples who inhabited Britain: Angles, Saxons and Jutes, and excluding Britons, Scots and Picts.Hastings, p. 37. In the final paragraph to the preface of the Ecclesiastical History of the English People Bede departs from the usual word \\"gens\\" and instead uses the word \\"natio\\" to describe the \\"historia nostrae nationis\\": the history of our own nation. This is the first verbal appearance of the English nation.Hastings, p. 38. The Anglo-Saxon poem The Battle of Maldon described the said battle between the Anglo-Saxon forces of Ethelred the Unready against a Viking invasion in 991. The poem praises the Anglo-Saxons defence of \\"their land, the land of Ethelred the King, the place and the people\\" and Byrhtnoth, Earl of Essex, is attributed as saying: \\"Shall our people, our nation, bear you to go hence with our gold?\\"Hastings, p. 42. Both Hastings and James Campbell believe England was a nation-state during late Anglo-Saxon times. Campbell writes that by the Norman conquest of 1066, \\"England was by then a nation-state\\".James Campbell, 'The United Kingdom of England: The Anglo-Saxon Achievement', Alexander Grant and Keith J. Stringer (eds.), Uniting the Kingdom? The Making of British History (London: Routledge, 1995), p. 31. =Medieval= The Norman conquest introduced a ruling class over England who displaced English land owners and clergy, and who spoke only Anglo-Norman, though it is likely many if not most were conversant in English from the second generation onwards. William of Malmesbury, a chronicler of mixed Anglo-Norman descent writing in the twelfth century, described the Battle of Hastings as: \\"That fatal day for England, the sad destruction of our dear country [dulcis patrie]\\".M. T. Clanchy, England and Its Rulers: 1066‚Äì1272 (Blackwell, 1998), p. 24. He also lamented: \\"England has become the habitation of outsiders and the dominion of foreigners. Today, no Englishman is earl, bishop, or abbot, and newcomers gnaw away at the riches and very innards of England; nor is there any hope for an end of this misery\\".Hugh M. Thomas, The English and the Normans: Ethnic Hostility, Assimilation and Identity 1066‚Äìc.1220 (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 56. Another chronicler, Robert of Gloucester, speaking in part of earlier centuries, in the mid to late thirteenth century: > ...the Norman could not speak anything then except their own speech, and > they spoke French as they had done at home, and had their children taught > it, too, so that important men in this country who come from their stock all > keep to that same speech that they derived from them; because, unless a man > knows French, he is thought little of. But humble men keep to English and > their own speech still. I reckon there are no countries in the whole world > that do not keep to their own speech, except England only.Basil Cottle, The > Triumph of English 1350‚Äì1400 (London: Blandford Press, 1969), p. 16. King Edward I, himself a Norman-French speaker, when issuing writs for summoning Parliament in 1295, claimed that the King of France planned to invade England and extinguish Old English, \\"a truly detestable plan which may God avert\\".Hastings, p. 45.\\"[Rex Franciae] linguam anglicam, si conceptae iniquitatis proposito detestabili potestas correspondeat, quod Deus avertat, omnino de terra delere proponit.\\" William Stubbs, Select Charters (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1946), p. 480. In the Cursor Mundi, an anonymous religious poem in northern Middle English dating from approximately 1300, appears the words: \\"Of Ingland the nacion\\".Hastings, p. 15. The Prologue starts: > :Efter haly kyrces state :√ûis ilke bok it es translate, :Into Inglis tong to > rede, :For √æe love of Inglis lede, :Inglis lede of Ingeland, :For √æe commun > at understand. :Frankis rimes here I redd :Comunlik in ilk a sted; :Mast es > it wroght for Frankis man ‚Äî :Quat is for him na Frankis can? :Of Ingeland √æe > nacioun, :Es Inglis man √æar in commun. :√ûe speche √æat man with mast may > spede, :Mast √æarwith to speke war nede. :Selden was for ani chance :Praised > Inglis tong in France; :Give we ilk an √æar langage, :Me think we do √æam non > outrage. :To lauid Inglis man I spell...

I am > speaking to the English layman...Cottle, p. 17. In 1323 Henry Lambard, a cleric, was brought before a court and asked how he wished to clear himself of charges of theft. Lambard said in English that he was a cleric and was then asked if he knew Latin or French. He replied that he was English, and English-born, and that to speak in his mother tongue was proper. He refused to speak any other language except English. Refusing to give any other answer to the court, he was committed to another court to suffer peine forte et dure.Michael Prestwich, Plantagenet England. 1225‚Äì1360 (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 556. During the later decades of the fourteenth century English started to come back into official use. The Pleading in English Act 1362 sought to replace French with English for all pleas in courts. The Mercers' Petition to Parliament of 1386 is the oldest piece of parliamentary English; the earliest English wills at the London Court of Probate date from 1387; the earliest English returns of the ordinances, usages, holdings of the gilds are from 1389 and come from London, Norwich and King's Lynn.Cottle, pp. 17‚Äì18. John Trevisa, writing in 1385, noted that: \\"...in all the grammar schools of England children are dropping French and construing and learning in English...Also gentlemen have now largely stopped teaching their children French\\".Cottle, pp. 20‚Äì21. The Hundred Years' War with France (1337‚Äì1453) aroused English nationalist feeling.Hastings, p. 47. May McKisack has claimed that \\"The most lasting and significant consequences of the war should be sought, perhaps, in the sphere of national psychology...For the victories were the victories, not only of the king and of the aristocracy, but of the nation\\".May McKisack, The Fourteenth Century 1307‚Äì1399 (Oxford University Press, 1959), p. 150. In 1346 was exhibited in Parliament for propaganda purposes a forged ordinance (in which the French King would have called for the elimination of the English nation) while Parliament was summoned to vote supplies to the king, who was engaged in the Siege of Calais. After the Siege of Calais of 1346, King Edward III expelled the inhabitants of that city because, in his words, \\"I wolde repeople agayne the towne with pure Englysshmen\\".William Paton Ker (ed.), The Chronicle of Froissart. Translated out of French by Sir John Bourchier, Lord Berners. Volume I (London: David Nutt, 1901), p. 332. When King Henry V conquered Harfleur in 1415, he ordered the inhabitants to leave and imported English immigrants to replace them.W. G. Boswell, Shakespeare's Holinshed. The Chronicle and the Historical Plays Compared (Chatto and Windus, 1907), p. 181, n. 1. King Edward III Edward III promoted Saint George during his wars against Scotland and France. Under Edward I and Edward II, pennons bearing the Cross of Saint George were carried, along with those of Saint Edmund the Martyr and Saint Edward the Confessor. However Edward III promoted St George over the previous national saints of St Edmund, St Edward the Confessor and Saint Gregory the Great.Ian Mortimer, The Perfect King. The Life of Edward III, Father of the English Nation (Vintage, 2008), p. 60.Henry Summerson, ‚ÄòGeorge (d. c.303?)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2007, accessed 3 October 2008. On 13 August 1351 St George was celebrated as \\"the blessed George, the most invincible athlete of Christ, whose name and protection the English race invoke as that of their patron, in war especially\\".Summerson. In Chichester in 1368 a guild was founded \\"to the honour of the holy Trinity and of its glorious martyr George, protector and patron of England\\". The Cross of St George was used by Edward III as banners on his ships and carried by his armies. St George became the patron saint of England and his cross eventually became the flag of England.Mortimer, p. 398. Laurence Minot, writing in the early fourteenth century, wrote patriotic poems celebrating Edward III's military victories against the Scots, French, Bohemians, Spaniards, Flemings and the Genoese.Cottle, p. 61.Douglas Gray, ‚ÄòMinot, Laurence (fl. early 14th cent.)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 13 September 2008. After the English victory at Cressy in 1346, a cleric wrote a Latin poem criticising the French and extolling the English: > :Francia, foeminea, pharisaea, vigoris idea :Lynxea, viperea, vulpina, > lupina, Medea... :Anglia regna, mundi rosa, flos sine spina :Mel sine > sentina, vicisti bella marina.Hastings, p. 49. In English, this is: > :France, womanish, pharisaic, embodiment of might :Lynx-like, viperish, > foxy, wolfish, a Medea... :Realm of England, rose of the world, flower > without thorn, :Honey without dregs; you have won the war at sea.Thomas > Beaumont James and John Simons (eds.), The Poems of Laurence Minot 1333‚Äì1352 > (University of Exeter Press, 1989), p. 86, p. 93. Shortly after Henry V's victory over the French at Agincourt in 1415, a song was written to celebrate the victory. It started: > :Deo gratias Anglia redde pro victoria! :Owre Kynge went forth to Normandy > :With grace and myght of chyvalry :Ther God for hym wrought mervelusly; > :Wherefore Englonde may call and cry :Deo gratias: :Deo gratias Anglia redde > pro victoria. John Wycliffe (1320s‚Äì1384), the founder of the reformist Lollard movement, argued against the power of the Pope over England: \\"Already a third and more of England is in the hands of the Pope. There cannot be two temporal sovereigns in one country; either Edward is king or Urban is king. We make our choice. We accept Edward of England and refuse Urban of Rome\\".Rev. James Aitken Wylie, The History of Protestantism. Volume I (London: Cassell, 1878), p. 67. Wycliffe justified his translating the Bible into English: \\"The gospels of Crist written in Englische, to moost lernyng of our nacioun\\". The historian Robert Colls has argued that \\"by the middle of the fourteenth-century nearly all the requirements for an English national identity were in place\\", including a \\"distinctive sense of territory and ethnicity, an English church, a set of national fables, and a clear common language\\".Robert Colls, Identity of England (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 17, p. 18. Scholar of nationalism Anthony D. Smith agrees to an extent, as from his ethnosymbolist perspective the ethnic core necessary for the development of modern nations had begun to crystallise during the fourteenth-century. That would not be to claim however that 'an English nation had come into existence, only that some of the processes that help to form nations had become discernible'.Anthony D. Smith, National Identity (Penguin, 1991), p. 56 =Tudor= King Henry VIII of England The historian of the Tudor period, Geoffrey Elton, has asserted that the \\"Tudor revolution in government\\" under King Henry VIII and his chief minister Thomas Cromwell has as its chief ingredient a concept of \\"national sovereignty\\".G. R. Elton, England under the Tudors. Third Edition (London: Routledge, 1991), p. 160. The Act in Restraint of Appeals 1533 famous preamble summarised this theory: > Where by divers sundry old authentic histories and chronicles it is > manifestly declared and expressed that this realm of England is an > empire...governed by one supreme head and king having the dignity and royal > estate of the imperial crown of the same, unto whom a body politic, compact > of all sorts and degrees of people divided in terms and by names of > spiritualty and temporalty, be bounden and owe to bear next to God a natural > and humble obedience.G. R. Elton (ed.), The Tudor Constitution. Documents > and Commentary. Second Edition (London: Cambridge University Press, 1982), > p. 353. By declaring England to be an \\"empire\\" this meant that England was a state entirely independent of \\"the authority of any foreign potentates\\". Elton claimed that \\"We call this sort of thing a sovereign national state\\".Elton, England under the Tudors, p. 161. The Act outlawed appeals from courts within the realm to courts outside the realm. The English Reformation destroyed the jurisdiction of the Pope over England. England was now completely independent.Elton, England under the Tudors, p. 162. For this reason Sir Thomas More went to his death, because in his words: \\"This realm, being but one member and small part of the Church, might not make a particular law dischargeable with the general law of Christ's holy Catholic Church, no more than the City of London being but one poor member in respect of the whole realm, might make a law against an act of Parliament\\". He later said: \\"I am not bounden...to conform my conscience to the Council of one realm against the General Council of Christendom. For of the foresaid holy bishops I have...above one hundred; and for one Council or Parliament...I have all the Councils made these thousand years. And for this one kingdom, I have all other Christian realms\\".A. G. Dickens, Thomas Cromwell and the English Reformation (London: The English Universities Press, 1959), pp. 64‚Äì65. When Mary (daughter of Henry and Catherine of Aragon) became Queen in 1553, she married Philip II of Spain and sought to return England to Roman Catholicism. Elton has written that \\"In the place of the Tudor secular temper, cool political sense, and firm identification with England and the English, she put a passionate devotion to the catholic religion and to Rome, absence of political guile, and pride in being Spanish\\".Elton, England under the Tudors, p. 214. Mary wanted to marry a Spaniard and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, chose Philip II (also his son and heir). With this marriage, England would become a Habsburg dominion and it did for a short time (arranged marriages such as these in the sixteenth century had built up the Habsburg empire). England \\"played barely the part of a pawn\\" in the diplomatic battle between the great European powers (France opposed the match) and the marriage was widely unpopular in England, even with Mary's own supporters such as Stephen Gardiner, who opposed reducing England to \\"a Spanish colony\\".Elton, England under the Tudors, p. 215. Ian Archer has argued that \\"the possibility that England might become another Habsburg milch cow was very real\\".Ian W. Archer, ‚ÄòWyatt, Sir Thomas (b. in or before 1521, d. 1554)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2006, accessed 6 September 2008. A courtier, Sir Thomas Wyatt, headed a rebellion to try to stop the marriage, motivated by a \\"nationalist resentment at the proposed foreign king\\".Elton, England under the Tudors, p. 217. Supporters of the insurgency urged Londoners to join to stop the English becoming \\"slaves and vilaynes\\", which was met with the response that \\"we are Englishmen\\".Archer. The uprising was defeated, and Wyatt at his trial justified his actions by saying: \\"Myne hole intent and styrre was agaynst the comyng in of strangers and Spanyerds and to abolyshe theym out of this realme\\". Mary vigorously persecuted Protestants, recorded by John Foxe in his Book of Martyrs, which were unprecedented in English history and resulted in an \\"undying hatred of the pope and of Roman Catholicism which became one of the most marked characteristics of the English for some 350 years\\".Elton, England under the Tudors, p. 220. Elizabeth I (who succeeded Mary in 1558) made a speech to Parliament on 5 November 1566, emphasising her Englishness: > \\"Was I not born in this realm? Were my parents born in any foreign country? > Is there any cause I should alienate myself from being careful over this > country? Is not my kingdom here?\\"L. S. Marcus, J. Mueller, and M. B. Rose > (eds.), Elizabeth I: Collected Works (University of Chicago Press, 2002), p. > 95. The excommunication of Elizabeth by Pope Pius V's papal bull (Regnans in Excelsis) of 1570; the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572; the publication of Foxe's Book of Martyrs; the Spanish Armada of 1588; and the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 all contributed to an English nationalism which was \\"thoroughly militant and Protestant\\".Hastings, p. 55. An example of this nationalism can be seen in Lord Chancellor Sir Christopher Hatton's opening speech to Parliament in 1589 in the aftermath of the defeat of the Armada. It has been described as \\"an appeal designed to rouse both patriotic and ideological responses\\".Wallace T. MacCaffrey, ‚ÄòHatton, Sir Christopher (c.1540‚Äì1591)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 6 September 2008. It was fiercely anti-Catholic (the Pope was a \\"wolfish bloodsucker\\"), execrated Englishmen who turned against their native country, and appealed for England's defence: \\"Shall we now suffer ourselves with all dishonour to be conquered? England hath been accounted hitherto the most renowned kingdom for valour and manhood in all Christendom, and shall we now lose our old reputation?\\".J. E. Neale, Queen Elizabeth (London: The Reprint Society, 1942), pp. 283‚Äì4. In 1591 a John Phillips published A Commemoration on the life and death of the right Honourable, Sir Christopher Hatton..., which included the lines: > :You noble peeres, my native Countrimen, :I need not shew to you my bloud > nor birth ... :Was not his hart bent for his Countries weale? ... :Take > courage then, maintaine your Countries right, ... :To straungers Yoakes, > your neckes doe never bow. ... :Our gratious Queene, of curtesie the flowre, > :Faire Englands Gem: of lasting blisse and joye: ... Sir Walter Raleigh, in his A Discourse of War, wrote that \\"if our King Edward III. had prospered in his French Wars, and peopled with English the Towns which he won, as he began at Calais, driving out the French; the Kings (as his Successors) holding the same Course, would by this Time have filled all France with our Nation, without any notable emptying of this Island\\".Thomas Birch (ed.), The Works of Sir Walter Ralegh, Kt., ii, (London: 1751), p. 27. Hastings has claimed that this usage of the word \\"nation\\" (used by Dr. Johnson in his Dictionary) is the same as the modern definition.Hastings, p. 14. Strong support exists among historians and students of nations and nationalism for the idea that England became a nation in or no later than the Tudor period. Liah Greenfeld argues that England was \\"the first nation in the world\\".Liah Greenfeld, Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity (Harvard University Press, 1992) Others, including Patrick Collinson and Diana Muir Appelbaum argue strongly for Tudor-era English nationhood.Patrick Collinson, The Birthpangs of Protestant England (1988) Others including Krishan Kumar, argue that nations arose only in the modern period and that England cannot be described as a nation until the late nineteenth century.Krishan Kumar, The Making of English National Identity, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003 =Stuart= The idea of the Norman yoke became increasingly popular amongst English radicals in the seventeenth century. They believed that Anglo- Saxon England was a land of liberty but that this liberty was extinguished by the Norman conquest and the imposition of feudalism. John Milton, writing in the 1640s, used nationalist rhetoric: \\"Lords and Commons of England, consider what nation it is whereoff ye are\\" and on another occasion: \\"Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation raising herself like a strong man after sleep\\". It has also been demonstrated by projects such as the Locating the Hidden Diaspora by Northumbria University that English communities in America and Canada had a clear sense of English ethnicity especially in the 1800s and set up many societies and organisations and celebrated English culture and traditions, such as the Sons of St George etc. In her widely cited book, Britons: Forging the Nation 1707-1837, Linda Colley argues for the formation of an English nation in the Stuart era.Linda Colley, Britons: Forging the Nation 1707‚Äì1837, 1992. Modern The English nationalist movement has its roots in a perception amongst many people in England that they are primarily or exclusively English rather than British, which mirrors the view in the other constituent countries. The perceived rise in English identity in recent years, as evidenced by the increased display of the English flag (particularly during international sporting competitions i.e. FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship), is sometimes attributed in the media to the increased devolution of political power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.BBC News Sunday 9 January 2000 English nationalism 'threat to UK' retrieved November 2011 One possible incentive for supporting the establishment of self-governing English political institutions has been the West Lothian question: the constitutional inconsistency whereby Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs in the UK Parliament have been able to cast votes on bills which will apply only to England while English MPs have had fewer such rights in relation to Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish legislation, which is in many cases handled by the devolved legislatures. This anomaly was addressed in 2015 using the English votes for English laws procedures to ensure that legislation affecting only England requires a majority vote of MPs representing English constituencies. Many contemporary English nationalist movements are associated with support for right-of-centre economic and social policies, but nationalists elsewhere in the UK tend towards a social democratic political stance, as evidenced by the policies of the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru. English nationalism is also often linked with Euroscepticism.Ben Wellings Political Resistance to European Integration and the foundations of contemporary English nationalism, 61st Annual Political Studies Association Conference, April 2011The English Democrats call for the immediate withdrawal from the European Union... website of the English Democrats at www.voteenglish.org, retrieved November 2011 While there is in principle no conflict between the objectives of English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish nationalism, there is an inherent incompatibility between many forms of English nationalism and Cornish nationalism, since Cornwall is administratively an integral part of England. Also, to the extent that English nationalism advocates the political separation of England from the remainder of the UK, it is not compatible with Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish Unionism. Brexit has been described as a symptom of English nationalism. =Opinion polls= A MORI opinion poll in 2006 commissioned by the Campaign for an English Parliament indicated that support for the creation of an English Parliament with the same powers as the existing Scottish Parliament had risen, with 41% of those questioned favouring such a move. In the same month an ICM Omnibus poll commissioned by the Progressive Partnership (a Scottish research organisation) showed that support for full English Independence had reached 31% of those questioned. In November 2006, another ICM poll, commissioned by the Sunday Telegraph, showed that support for an English Parliament had reached 68% and support for full English Independence had reached 48% of those questioned. A study conducted for the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) in 2005 found that, in England, the majority of ethnic minority participants born there identified primarily as being British, whereas white English participants identified as being English first and British second. A YouGov survey for the BBC in 2018 found young people are less likely to feel proud to be English than older generations and the further someone lives from London, the more likely they are to identify with a particular part of England.

The plate was hung outside his office on Martin Luther Str, Sch√∂neberg, Berlin. In 1933, following the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service the plate was painted black by the Nazis, who boycotted Jewish owned offices. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (, shortened to Berufsbeamtengesetz), also known as Civil Service Law, Civil Service Restoration Act, and Law to Re-establish the Civil Service, was a law passed by the Nazi regime of Germany on 7 April 1933, two months after Adolf Hitler had attained power. It was one of the first anti-Semitic and racist laws to be passed in the Third Reich. Articles of the law Article 1 of the Law claimed that in order to re-establish a \\"national\\" and \\"professional\\" civil service, members of certain groups of tenured civil servants were to be dismissed.The Nazi Germany Sourcebook: An Anthology of Texts, ed Roderick Stackelberg, Sally A. Winkle, Routledge, 15 Apr 2013, Article 1 First Regulation for Administration of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service Civil servants who were not of Aryan descent were to retire. Non-Aryans were defined as someone descended from non-Aryans, especially those descended from Jewish parents, or grandparents.The Nazi Germany Sourcebook: An Anthology of Texts, ed Roderick Stackelberg, Sally A. Winkle, Routledge, 15 Apr 2013, Article 3.12b First Regulation for Administration of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service Members of the Communist Party, or any related or associated organisation were to be dismissed.The Nazi Germany Sourcebook: An Anthology of Texts, ed Roderick Stackelberg, Sally A. Winkle, Routledge, 15 Apr 2013, Article 2 First Regulation for Administration of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service This meant that Jews, other non Aryans, and political opponents could not serve as teachers, professors, judges, or other government positions. Shortly afterward, a similar law was passed concerning lawyers, doctors, tax consultants, musicians, and notaries. As the law was first drafted by the Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, all those of \\"non-Aryan descent\\" were to be fired immediately at the Reich, L√§nder and municipal levels of government. However, the President of Germany, Paul von Hindenburg objected to the bill until it had been amended to exclude three classes of civil servants from the ban: *World War I veterans who had served at the front *those who had been in the civil service continuously since 1 August 1914 (i.e. since the start of the War) *those who lost a father or son in combat in the Great WarSee Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service for the exceptions. Hitler agreed to these amendments and the bill was signed into law on 7 April 1933.Under the Enabling Act of 1933, neither the consent of the Reichstag nor the signature of the President of the Republic was any longer required for the promulgation of law. The amendment for Hindenburg was thus a matter of political expediency, not of legal necessity. In practice, the amendments excluded most Jewish civil servants and not until after Hindenburg's death in 1934, were they disallowed. Nonetheless, passage of the Berufsbeamtengesetz was a crucial turning point in the history of German Jewry for it marked the first time since the last German Jews had been emancipated in 1871 that an anti-Semitic law had been passed in Germany. In one particularly notable example of the law's effect, Albert Einstein resigned his position at the Prussian Academy of Sciences and emigrated to the United States before he could be expelled. Content Following the decree, Albert Gorter redefined the term 'Aryan' in the Aryan paragraph as: However, this definition was unacceptable because it included non-European races. Achim Gercke later redefined this unacceptable definition as the one already used by the Expert Advisor for Population and Racial Policy which stated \\"An Aryan is one who is tribally related to German blood. An Aryan is the descendant of a Volk domiciled in Europe in a closed tribal settlement since recorded history.\\" This new definition allowed the Civil Service Law to differentiate between 'Aryans' and 'non-Aryans'. However, the quantity of how much Jewish blood an individual was allowed to have until it was considered to damage the German Volk remained untenable. (The following is translated from the German version of this page.) Political opponents of national socialism (\\"Officials who, on account of their past political activities cannot guarantee that they have always acted wholeheartedly for the national state\\") should either be forced into retirement or let go from their jobs. Moreover, civil servants should be let go if they had started their jobs after 1918 and were now unable to demonstrate that they had acquired all the training necessary for their careers. These people were called \\"membership book officials (Parteibuch- Beamte)\\" in the language of National Socialist propaganda. According to ¬ß 3 (1) of the \\"First Ordinace for the accomplishment of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, the first definition of a Jew was defined as: They could be let go or prematurely forced into retirement. According to ¬ß 3 (2), however, \\"non-Aryan\\" officials should be left in their positions if they had occupied those positions since a date before August 1914. Those Jewish civil servants who had a son or father who had been killed in the First World War were also spared from being sacked. This loophole also applied to \\"Frontk√§mpfer\\" (Front-line soldiers) (see Frontk√§mpferprivileg). All persons in the civil service would have to be able to produce the Ariernachweis (proof of Aryan ancestry) in order to prove that they had no ancestors of the Jewish faith. The loophole was closed by the Nuremberg Laws. Jewish civil servants still holding their posts were given notice by 31 December 1935 at the latest. According to ¬ß 6 of the law, civil servants could be forced into retirement without cause \\"for the simplification of administration\\". The vacant positions created by this action were not to be refilled. In rapid succession numerous regulations were dispensed with, as well as many employees and laborers in civil service as well as in the Reichsbank. Pensions were not allowed for all groups of people forced into the ranks of pensioners by this law. The guaranteed old-age pension was reduced in 1938 by the \\"Siebente Verordnung zum Reichsb√ºrgergesetz\\". On 1 September 1933, Frick issued the second supplementary decree of the law in attempt to define the terms ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-Aryan‚Äù: Related ordinances *11 April 1933 - First Ordinance on the Implementation of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil ServiceHentschel, 1996, 25-26.

However, until recently those same local authorities have not held a unified and consistent list of addresses within their areas. This has led to various services within individual local authorities maintaining separate and incompatible address databases. In recent years the central government of the UK has required local authorities to modernise their processes to take advantage of new technologies and provide better linked up services to their residents and businesses. One of the key ways to achieve this goal has been to develop one address resource for their entire local authority area. This has ultimately meant that a resident may notify a council of their change of address at one place without having to repeat the process throughout a number of service areas within an authority. As part of this process the National Land and Property Gazetteer (NLPG) was created. This is a central repository or ‚Äúhub‚Äù for all LLPGs and coordinates the many LLPGs created by local authorities. It also enforces the compliance of all LLPGs with the national standard for the representation of address information, British Standard 7666 (BS7666). Largely through pressure from the central UK government for a consistent address resource the NLPG has become UK‚Äôs definitive address infrastructure. However, the development of the NLPG has been held back by arguments between local authorities and the national mapping agency, Ordnance Survey, who are required to act as a trading entity. This has led to the NLPG being unable to compel local authorities to maintain their LLPGs as well as protracted negotiations regarding issues of ownership of address data. In May 2005 local authorities in the UK signed an agreement (Mapping Services Agreement) with suppliers of geographic data, which included Ordnance Survey and the managers of the NLPG. This solved the issues surrounding ownership of address data and contained many restrictions on the use of LLPGs by local authorities as well as compulsions upon local authorities to maintain their LLPGs. However, simultaneously, Ordnance Survey published a proposal to develop an alternative address infrastructure called the National Spatial Address Infrastructure (NSAI). This involved Ordnance Survey taking ownership of the NLPG and then selling it back to the same local authorities that had created the LLPGs that make up the NLPG. This provoked another round of arguments between Ordnance Survey and local authorities. The NSAI has now been abandoned by Ordnance Survey. On 3 December 2010, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced the formation of GeoPlace to provide a freely-available national address gazetteer. This is a joint venture between the Local Government Association and Ordnance Survey. The venture underwent a process of approval by the Office of Fair Trading, which passed a judgement allowing the venture on 15 February 2011. Following the setting up of GeoPlace, NLPG data has been brought together with Ordnance Survey, Valuation Office Agency and Royal Mail data into the National Address Gazetteer infrastructure. The National Address Gazetteer infrastructure is the single source from which the AddressBase products from Ordnance Survey are developed.

He also developed the concepts of \\"prosumers,\\" \\"atmospherics,\\" and \\"societal marketing.\\" He is regarded as,\\"The Father of Modern Marketing\\" by many scholars. Kotler's latest work focuses on economic justice and the shortcomings of capitalism. He published Confronting Capitalism: Real Solutions for a Troubled Economic System in 2015, Democracy in Decline: Rebuilding its Future in 2016, \\"Advancing the Common Good\\" in 2019, and Brand Activism: From Purpose to Action in 2018. Early life Both of Kotler's parents, Betty and Maurice, emigrated in 1917 from Russian Empire (currently territory of Ukraine) and settled in Chicago, where Kotler was born on May 27, 1931. He studied at DePaul University for two years and was accepted without a bachelor's degree into the Master's program at the University of Chicago (1953) and his PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1956), earning both degrees in economics. He studied under three Nobel Laureates in Economic Science: Milton Friedman, Paul Samuelson, and Robert Solow. He did a year of postdoctoral work in mathematics at Harvard University (1960) and in behavioral science at the University of Chicago (1961). Views about marketing Kotler started teaching marketing in 1962 at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. He believed marketing was an essential part of economics and saw demand as influenced not only by price but also by advertising, sales promotions, sales forces, direct mail, and various middlemen (agents, retailers, wholesalers, etc.) operating as sales and distribution channels. Philip Kotler holds that: > \\"the organization's marketing task is to determine the needs, wants and > interests of target markets and to achieve the desired results more > effectively and efficiently than competitors, in a way that preserves or > enhances the consumer's or society's well-being.\\" He links the profit motive to the satisfaction of consumer wants and society's well-being. In order to market effectively, Kotler believes the marketing purpose of elevating consumer well-being has to be put at the heart of company strategy and be practiced by all managers. In 2003, the Financial Times cited Kotler's three major contributions to marketing and to management: > First, he has done more than any other writer or scholar to promote the > importance of marketing, transforming it from a peripheral activity, bolted > on to the more \\"important\\" work of production. Second, he continued a trend > started by Peter Drucker, shifting emphasis away from price and distribution > to a greater focus on meeting customers' needs and on the benefits received > from a product or service. Third, he has broadened the concept of marketing > from more selling to a more general process of communication and exchange, > and has shown how marketing can be extended and applied to charities, > museums, performing arts organizations, political parties and many other > non-commercial situations. Kotler argued for \\"broadening the field of marketing\\" to cover not only commercial operations but also the operations of non-profit organizations and government agencies. He held that marketing can be applied not only to products, services, and experiences, but also to causes, ideas, persons, and places. Thus a museum needs the marketing skills of Product, Price, Place, and Promotion (the 4P's) if it is to be successful in attracting visitors, donors, staff members, and public support. Kotler and Gerald Zaltman created the field of social marketing, which applies marketing theory to influence behavior change that would benefit consumers, their peers, and society as a whole. Kotler and Sidney Levy developed the idea of demarketing, which organizations must employ to reduce overall or selective demand when demand is too high. Thus, when water is in short supply, the government needs to persuade various water consumers to reduce water usage so that enough water will be available for essential uses. In 2018, Christian Sarkar and Kotler began promoting brand activism, the idea that businesses must go beyond Corporate Social Responsibility to tackle the world's most urgent problems. Writings and activities In 1967, Kotler published Marketing Management: Analysis, Planning, and Control, now in its 15th edition,{2016} and the world's most widely adopted textbook in graduate schools of business.{{citation needed} Whereas previous marketing textbooks were highly descriptive, this text was the first to draw on economic science, organizational theory, psychology of behavior and choice, and analytics. It described theory and practice, and drew on findings from empirical studies and cases. On December 9, 1996, the Financial Times cited Marketing Management as one of the 50 greatest business books of all time {December 9, 1996} Kotler is the author and co-author of over 166 published articles and 80 books, , Kotler has also written books on such subjects as corporate social responsibility, education, environment, government marketing, healthcare, hospitality, innovation, museums, performing arts, place marketing, poverty alleviation, professional services, religious institutions, tourism, capitalism, and democracy. Kotler was invited to be the first Legend in Marketing. His published articles are presented, analyzed, and commented on in the nine-volume Legends in Marketing Series: Philip Kotler, edited by Professor Jagdish Sheth{2012} In 2014, he started a blog on fixcapitalism.com that featured many articles on making capitalism work better for more people. In 2016, he co-founded (with Christian Sarkar) The Marketing Journal, an online site dedicated to sharing insights and next practices in marketing. In 2017, Kotler published his autobiography - My Adventures in Marketing, an account of his experiences from his formative years to the present, including his views on topics such as demarketing, brand activism, marketing of the arts, place marketing, as well as the challenges facing capitalism, democracy, and the common good. In 2018, Kotler co-founded a think tank with futurist David Houle and Jason Voss called The Sarasota Institute. The TSI sponsors public meetings and publishes peer-reviewed articles in ten areas: Technology, Public Policy, Natural Resources, Marketing and Media, Intelligence, Health Care, Education, Democracy, Climate Change, and Economics. In 2018, with Christian Sarkar, he co-founded ActivistBrands.com, an online resource on progressive brand activism. In 2019, Christian Sarkar and Kotler began an open-source project to model the world's most urgent problems. The Wicked7 Project aims to create an online movement of individuals and institutions interested in finding \\"virtuous solutions\\" to pressing wicked problems. Honorable distinctions In 1975, Kotler was the first person to receive the \\"Leader in Marketing Thought\\" award voted on by the academic members of the American Marketing Association. The Financial Times on November 18, 2005 surveyed 1,000 executives in 25 countries about the Most Influential Business Writers/Management Gurus, and Kotler ranked fourth after Peter Drucker, Bill Gates, and Jack Welch. Kotler's contributions are described in at least one chapter found in every book written about the \\"gurus\\" of business and management (see References below). In 2007, Kotler was appointed a special Ambassador at large for Indonesian Tourism. In May 2011, the city of Denpasar in Bali bestowed the title of honorary resident of Denpasar. On February 16, 2013, he was the first recipient of the William L. Wilkie \\"Marketing for a Better World\\" award from the American Marketing Association to \\"honor marketers who have significantly contributed to the understanding and appreciation for marketing's potential to improve the world.\\"Financial Times (2003), ibid. Also, in 2013 he was the first recipient of the Sheth Foundation Medal for Exceptional Contribution to Marketing Scholarship and Practice. On November 7, 2013, Kotler received the Badge of Honor of Officer of the Order of Academic Palms established in France in the 19th Century. On November 19, 2013, Kotler was inducted into the Management Hall of Fame, along with 10 other management gurus (see www.thinkers50.com/hall-of-fame/). On March 1, 2014, Kotler is number 16 in the list of the 30 World's Top Management Professionals and the only marketer. On May 28, 2014, Kotler is inducted in the Marketing Hall of Fame in New York City. On April 23, 2016, Kotler received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Leaders International at the 6th Global Leadership Awards. In 2020, Kotler was voted the #3 Guru in Management in the top 30 Gurus of Management. Kotler is also the founder (2011) along with Fahim Kibria of the World Marketing Summit. WMS sponsors global conferences with top speakers discussing the latest developments in marketing and business practice that will improve commerce and the quallity of life. He also established with Hermawan Kartajaya the world's first Museum of Marketing (3.0) in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia.. Kotler is a collector of fine Japanese netsukes and swordguards. He and his wife Nancy are major collectors of studio art glass. They contributed a major portion of their glass collection to the Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida. The Kotlers and the Covilles funded the Glass Pavilion building at the museum. Kotler has received 23 honorary degrees from around the world (at Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest, Athens School of Economics, BI Norwegian School of Management, Budapest School of Economic Science and Public Administration, Catholic University Santo Domingo, DePaul University, Cracow School of Economics, Groupe HEC, HHL Graduate School of Management, Iliria University, Istanbul Ticaret University, La Sapienza University, Mackenzie University, Mediterranean University, National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy, Nyenrode Business University, Plekhanov Russian Academy of Economics, Universidad Americana, Universidad del Pacifico, University American College, University of Bucharest, University of Stockholm, and University of Zurich).  Family  Philip has two brothers, Milton and the late Neil Kotler. Philip met Nancy at Radcliffe (Harvard) and they married in 1955. They have three daughters, Amy, Melissa and Jessica and nine grandchildren.  Kotler Board of Impact  Philip started a strategic marketing community to ensure marketing and economic progress through diversity.

The route begins at its junction with the Limerick Southern M7 ring road (Junction 29). Pallasgreen and Oola are two small villages through which the route passes before reaching Tipperary. Before the town the road passes by Limerick Junction, a major railway intersection for the region. Bansha lies further southeast along the route, and the road meets the M8 Cork - Dublin motorway just outside Cahir. The N24 passes north of Cahir, turning east towards Clonmel. A bypass brings the road around the north of Clonmel, and the road continues east to Carrick-on-Suir. From here the road undulates in an east/southeast/south direction to reach Waterford. The road ends at its intersection with the N9 from Dublin. History Due to its winding alignment between Clonmel and Cahir, the road now known as the N24 caused considerable annoyance to one \\"X.Z.\\", an anonymous Englishman who toured Ireland in the summer of 1782. \\"X.Z.\\", who was travelling from Dublin to Cork, had not seen fit to comment on the state of Ireland's roads until he left Clonmel for Cahir: \\"From Clonmel we rode west 8 miles to Cahir and here we first noticed the difference between Munster and Leinster roads: the roads in Munster are not carried on right lines, but wind about considerably in different places for no reason that we could find out, except it be in some places for the sake of mounting a few steep hills, which would be avoided if the roads were carried in a straight line - They seem the paths formerly trod by their ancestors, and are in some places paved and gravelled, in others in a natural state - Travelling on these accounts is very slow in Munster, especially if we go out of turnpike roads.\\"Quoted in David Broderick, The First Toll-Roads: Ireland's Turn-Pike Roads, 1729-1858 (Cork, 2002), p. 106 Between Cahir and its junction with the N76 east of Clonmel, the N24 once formed an integral part of the T6 - the old trunk road that connected the cities of Cork and Dublin before the contemporary numbering system was established.

The well regarded 'county' department store began as a drapery shop, founded by Frank Bentall in 1867. The company was formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange, but since 2001 has been owned by the private Fenwick group. History Bentalls was established in 1867 by Frank Bentall who purchased a drapery shop in Kingston upon Thames. The principal buildings of the Kingston store were completed in 1935 to a design by architect Maurice Webb (son of Sir Aston Webb) and inspired by Wren's design for Hampton Court. The fine stonework on the fa√ßade was the work of Eric Gill. Between 1935 and 1976 it was the UK's largest department store outside central London. It became a Grade II listed building in 2011. The facade of the original store has been retained as part of the Bentall Centre shopping development which was opened in 1992, in which the principal Bentalls store is now located. The store previously occupied buildings covering the entire site of the development. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1946, but the Bentall family retained a controlling interest. Bentalls established their first branch store in 1947 when the Worthing department store of Bentall & Sons was acquired from family cousins who had decided to retire. The Worthing business was significantly extended with the purchase of the Jordan & Cook furniture store in later years. The Ealing department store of Eldred Sayers & Son was acquired in 1950. Mary Lee of Tunbridge Wells was purchased a decade later. Under the association with Frank Bentall's grandson Rowan Bentall, who was Chairman between 1968-1978, the company expanded with a new purpose-built Bentalls department store opening in Bracknell in 1973. Further stores were opened in Chatham, Tonbridge and Lakeside. As a result, the group's turnover more than doubled from ¬£14.5 million to ¬£35.1 million.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-rowan- bentall-1488052.html The company subsequently opened a store in Bristol and closed the stores in Chatham and Tunbridge Wells. In 2000, the chain rejected a ¬£27 million offer from its rival Allders. In January 2001, Bentalls sold their loss-making Bristol store to rival House of Fraser for ¬£16.35 million.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/mar/31/10 In June of that year, the family-owned rival department store chain Fenwick purchased Bentalls for ¬£70.8 million. The Bentall family's shareholding at the time was 38%, with Frank Bentall's great grandson Edward Bentall being the Chairman. The company's turnover was ¬£108.2 million.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/jun/29/1 The chain then consisted of six stores: Bracknell, Ealing, Kingston upon Thames, Lakeside, Tonbridge and Worthing. Fenwick subsequently sold the Lakeside store to Allders and the leases of the Bentalls sites in Ealing, Tonbridge and Worthing to the Bournemouth based Beales group. The successful stores in Kingston upon Thames and Bracknell were retained. The Bracknell branch was replaced in September 2017 by a new Fenwick store as part of The Lexicon development. Current operations Kingston is one of the largest retail centres in the south-east and Bentalls itself is popular among many shoppers. In the days approaching Christmas, Bentalls Kingston is said to take over ¬£1 million per day.

The bombings, which caused no known casualties, were claimed by the North Yemen-based Nasserite organisation Union of the People of the Arabian Peninsula [ittihad sha'b al-jazira al-'arabiyya] (UPAP). After the attacks, Saudi authorities arrested several hundred Yemenis, executed 17 of them and expelled the rest. 1979 20 November‚Äì4 December (See Grand Mosque Seizure) - number of militants took over the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca to protest the House of Saud's policies of Westernization. The militants were well organized and armed and were initially able to repel attempts by the Saudi National Guard to storm the complex. The Saudis eventually brought in French and Pakistani commandos to help their forces retake the Mosque. Non-Muslim commandos underwent nominal conversion to Islam before being allowed into the Mosque. Eventually the Mosque was retaken and the 63 or 67 surviving male militants were executed. The number of people killed in the siege and the total number of militants involved are disputed. Official sources put the death toll at 255, but others suggest that it was higher. Ruhollah Khomeini addressed on Radio regarding the seizure of the Mosque on 21 November. 1988 30 September - four Shi'ite men are beheaded for blowing up fuel storage tanks at the Saudi Petrochemical Company (SADAF) facility in Jubail.

Two pick-up trucks carrying two would-be bombers tried to enter the side gate to the Abqaiq plant in the Eastern Province, the largest oil processing facilities in the world (more than 60% of Saudi production), but the attackers detonated their explosives after security guards fired on them, according to statements from Saudi's interior and oil ministries. According to Saudi sources, the plant was not damaged and only minor damage to one small (1.5 inch) pipeline was caused by splinters, along with serious injuries among security guards and minor injuries among a few Aramco plant workers. The dead suspects were later named as Muhammed Al-Gaith and Abdullah Al-Tuwaijri.

Laws was laid down on 19 May 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Washington; launched on 22 April 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Mary A. Farwell; and commissioned on 18 November 1943, Commander Lester O. Wood in command. 1944 After shakedown, Laws departed San Francisco on 11 February 1944, joining the advance forces at Kwajalein on 4 March. Following two weeks of antisubmarine training, the destroyer sailed on the 20th to screen a refueling group supporting the raids on Palau, Yap, and Ulithi. Laws continued screening operations for the next month, accompanying tankers as they replenished units during the Hollandia operation. After a brief respite at Pearl Harbor, Laws arrived at Roi Island 8 June, to join a carrier group en route to Saipan. Reaching her destination on the 15th, she screened the carriers as they hurled heavy air strikes against the Mariana Islands. Two days later, enemy planes made a vain attempt to penetrate the screen and find the carriers. Laws 5 inch guns threw up a deadly barrage of antiaircraft fire, splashing two enemy planes and assisting in the downing of another. The destroyer remained in the Saipan area on patrol and screening duty until mid-August. Additional bases were needed as staging areas for ships and aircraft during the planned Leyte invasion; and the Palau Island group was selected. Sailing with the carrier group on 29 August, Laws stood by as the mighty force softened up the beaches for the upcoming assault. On 9 September the force turned its attention to the Philippines, launching air strikes against Mindanao. While en route to their target, friendly planes reported a Japanese force of 40 small craft off Sanco Point; two cruisers, Laws, and three other destroyers were sent to intercept the group. The carrier aircraft had already started to attack when the cruiser-destroyer force arrived on the scene. The enemy proved no match for the Americans, as Laws and her sister ships launched a coordinated attack, wiping out the convoy. Laws continued screening carriers until arriving at Ulithi on 1 October. At sea again on 6 October, she joined the carriers as they struck Formosa and Okinawa before arriving off Leyte two weeks later. Laws remained offshore giving close support to the 20 October invasion of Leyte. Since American occupation of the Philippines would cut squarely across enemy supply lines from the East Indies to the home islands, the Japanese could be expected to strike back at the invasion with their entire fleet. Planes from Carrier Task Force 38 (TF 38), to which Laws was attached, located the Japanese Center Force on 24 October as the enemy steamed toward San Bernardino Strait; strikes from the carriers sank the battleship in the ensuing Battle of the Sibuyan Sea. As American bombers and torpedo planes punished other enemy ships of the Center Force, Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr.'s search planes scouted the seas in quest of enemy carriers. When they spotted Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa's force toward mid- afternoon, Laws raced north with the carriers to intercept. Reaching striking range during the early hours next morning and shortly after dawn, the carriers launched planes to begin a day-long pounding that sank four carriers and a destroyer. Meanwhile, the Japanese suffered other crippling defeats at Surigao Strait and off Samar. When the last smoke from these momentous engagements-- collectively known as the Battle of Leyte Gulf--had cleared, Japan had all but lost its Imperial Navy, the Philippines, and all hope of winning the war. As the Japanese Navy Minister, Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, reflected after the close of hostilities \\"...defeat at Leyte was tantamount to the loss of the Philippines. When you took the Philippines, that was the end of our resources.\\" 1945 Laws continued to screen the carriers as they conducted strikes against Japanese forces on Leyte and Luzon for the rest of the year. Sailing with the carriers late in December, she supported the amphibious assault on Luzon on 6 January 1945. Bringing destruction closer to Tokyo, her task group next concentrated raids on the China coast and Formosa before replenishing at Ulithi. Departing 10 February, Laws joined a destroyer radar picket unit set up to give the carrier forces early warning of enemy attacks. On the 19th, she screened the flattops as they struck Iwo Jima, a volcanic island fortress needed for a B-29 airstrip. After supporting the invasion campaign until success was assured, Laws retired to Ulithi on 12 March. Preparations for the invasion of Okinawa, the last remaining barrier on the road to Japan, were now complete. Laws departed Ulithi on 21 March, as part of Task Force 54 (TF 54), to take up patrol station in advance of the planned 1 April invasion. Providing support for minesweeping operations and underwater demolition teams, the veteran destroyer proved her value. The Allies, sweeping down on the enemy, planted a garrison in Japan's backyard, as Laws stood by on patrol and shore bombardment. On 6 April she splashed a Zeke as it made its way toward the fleet. The destroyer remained off Okinawa until the island was declared secure, and continued operations in its vicinity for the rest of the war. With the cessation of hostilities with Japan's surrender, Laws departed Ulithi on 7 September, and arrived Bremerton, Washington, on 15 September. Later that year she steamed to San Diego, California, where she remained until decommissioning on 10 December 1946. 1951 - 1964 When the need arose for additional ships to support the Korean War, Laws was recommissioned on 2 November 1951 at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, Commander Willard Y. Howell in command. After a year of modernization and hunter-killer training operations, the destroyer departed San Diego on 13 November 1952 for service in the Far East. Arriving at Yokosuka, Japan, three days before Christmas of 1952, Laws joined TF 77 four days later, and headed for the east coast of Korea. During January 1953 the destroyer remained off the coast to screen carriers engaged in raids on the embattled peninsula. On 19 February, Laws proceeded independently to Nando Island, where she bombarded the shore, supporting the ROK 15th Division by silencing two enemy shore emplacements on 6 March. She continued operations in support of American forces in Korea until late May when she sailed to patrol off Formosa. Laws completed her Far East tour early in July and arrived at San Diego on 20 July. Operating on a tactical training schedule for the next seven months, the destroyer departed on her second Western Pacific (WestPac) cruise on 3 March 1954. She joined the Seventh Fleet in peacekeeping operations and during the summer remained on alert to support the Chinese Nationalist positions in the Tachen Islands. Laws returned to San Diego on 12 September and resumed training operations off the west coast for the rest of the year. From 1955 through 1957 Laws made annual cruises to the Far East to operate with the Seventh Fleet, including Taiwan patrol and training exercises. On 1 July 1958, Laws was assigned to Reserve Escort Division 12 and commenced service as a training ship. She continued reserve cruises along the coast from Mazatl√°n, Mexico, to Canada until 2 February 1962 when she sailed on another WestPac cruise. While in the Far East, Laws exercised with the Korean and Nationalist Chinese Navy and remained on the alert during the Laotian crisis. Fate Returning San Francisco on 17 July 1962, the destroyer resumed operations as a Naval Reserve training ship and continued in this capacity until she was decommissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California, on 30 March 1964.

Kerry Croppy was a nickname given to Irish rebels fighting for independence from Britain during the 1798 Rising.  Origin  The name \\"Croppy\\" used in Ireland in the 1790s was a reference to the closely cropped hair associated with the anti-powdered wig (and therefore, anti-aristocratic) French revolutionaries of the period. Men with their hair cropped were automatically suspected of sympathies with the pro-French underground organisation the Society of United Irishmen, and were often seized by the British administration and its allies for interrogation; they were also subjected to torture via methods such as flogging, picketing and half-hanging. The contemporary torture known as pitchcapping, or An Caip Bh√°is in Irish, was specifically invented to intimidate Croppies. United Irish activists retaliated by cropping the hair of Ulster loyalists to reduce the reliability of this method of identifying their sympathisers .

Selznick's Select Pictures Corporation. Directed by Harley Knoles from a screenplay by Harry Chandlee, it is based on the 1909 novel Comrades: A Story of Social Adventure in California by Thomas Dixon, author of another novel that served as the basis for The Birth of a Nation.Hagedorn, 175 It premiered in April 1919 during the First Red Scare.Hanson, 86 Plot Barbara, a wealthy female socialite intent on reforming capitalism is lured into the Socialist cause by Herman, a Socialist agitator. Her concerned boyfriend Norman hears her lecture on the virtues of international socialism and is converted to her views. Prompted by Herman, she raises money among her wealthy friends to buy Paradise Island off the Florida coast to establish a collective colony, a society of \\"happiness and plenty.\\" Norman tries to raise money from his father and is rebuffed. His father expects Norman will benefit from the experience: \\"He'll get his island and a lesson along with it.\\" When the wealthy colonists settled on their island, they elect Norman their \\"Chief Comrade.\\" They quickly discover that none of them has any worthwhile skills. Most identify themselves as \\"assistant managers.\\" Faced with disorganization, the colonists replace Norman with Herman, as the activist had long intended. He establishes a police force, abolishes marriage, and has the state assume ownership of the women and children. He imprisons Norman, which prompts Barbara's epiphany: \\"The poor deluded people will starve and die as they are in Russia.\\" She rejects Herman's advances and Norman's father arrives at the head of a Navy fleet to save the day.

Then distribute handbills to the confused and curious crowds assuring them that Bolshevism on Trial takes a stand against Bolshevism and \\"you will not only clean up but will profit by future business.\\"Hagedorn, 175, 180 When this publicity technique came to the attention of U.S. Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson, he expressed his dismay to the press: \\"This publication proposes by deceptive methods of advertising to stir every community in the United States into riotous demonstrations for the purpose of making profits for the moving picture business... .\\" He hoped to ban movies treating Bolshevism and Socialism.Hagedorn, 180 ReferencesNotesBibliography= * Hagedorn, Ann, Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919 (NY: Simon & Schuster, 2007) * Hanson, Patricia King and Gevinson, Alan, eds., The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States, vol.F1: Feature Films, 1911-1920 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988) External links * Category:1919 films Category:American films Category:American silent feature films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on works by Thomas Dixon Jr. Category:American black-and- white films Category:1919 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American anti-communist propaganda films Category:Selznick Pictures films Category:Films directed by Harley Knoles ","title":"Bolshevism on Trial"},{"id":"2758257","text":"Methil Power Station was a small base load coal slurry-fired power station in the town of Methil, Fife, Scotland. It was situated on the south side of the mouth of the River Leven, where the river enters the Firth of Forth. It was a local landmark, with the chimney visible for some distance.  Design  The power station consisted of two 30-megawatt (MW) generation units for a peak rating of 57 MWe. It was commissioned in 1965 for the then South of Scotland Electricity Board. Built on the site of a golf course, it was designed to utilise low-grade coal slurry supplied from the washeries of the nearby Fife coalfield. This coal was delivered by road and rail wagons shunted into and out of elevated sidings. Like almost all other coal-fired power stations in Scotland, Methil did not use cooling towers, instead using sea water as coolant. An exception was Methil's sister station of Barony, situated in central Ayrshire.  History  East Fife F.C. play against Berwick Rangers F.C. overlooked by Methil Power Station This station was built as a sister to Barony Power Station on the West Coast of Scotland, in Ayrshire. Although the design of Methil was based on that of Barony, it incorporated many improvements. As the Scottish coalfields were exhausted or abandoned in the mid-1980s, waste accumulated in coal tips, and this waste was used as a fuel in the Methil and Barony power stations. However, as the tips were cleared, operations at the two stations ceased due to lack of coal-slurry fuel and the uneconomical operation of such small facilities. This station ceased generating in 2000 and was put into standby as a strategic reserve. The power station was finally demolished in 2011 as part of a regeneration of this area. The preferred redevelopment option for the site is for leisure and tourism. A retail park or shopping centre development is also being considered.

The game was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and on August 14, 1995 in the United States. It is set in the Milky Way galaxy, and has players maneuvering a puck around one of four pinball tables available in the game. The Virtual Boy's standard red-and-black color scheme resulted in criticism of this and other games on the platform for causing nausea, headaches, and eye strain. It also uses parallax, which allows the game to display three-dimensional effects. It has received a mixed reception; it was praised for its authenticity, while reception to its physics and controls were mixed. It has also received criticism for its lack of ambition and originality. Gameplay and premise Gameplay of Galactic Pinball. The game is designed with red and black visuals. Galactic Pinball is set in the Milky Way galaxy, and tells the story of the discovery of a new, strange world. At the Title Screen, players can choose from four pinball tables: Cosmic, Colony, UFO, and Alien. Players can also choose to look at the top scores. The Cosmic table features a cameo from Metroid where players control protagonist Samus Aran's ship. Players are given five pucks, which players must keep going by using the flippers to hit it upward. The goal is to accumulate points and avoid allowing the puck to drop to the bottom of the table. The game begins with players shooting a puck into the table by holding the A button to launch it with a plunger. The longer the button is held, the harder the puck is launched. Players can also push a button to shake the in- game table, though if it is used too often, the flippers will be disabled and the puck will fall. There are various bonuses that players can experience during play. Some tables allow players to activate a \\"Bonus Roulette wheel\\", and some will allow them to get bonus points by collecting letters that spell the table's name. Bonus points will be awarded when a puck drops out of play, which varies depending on how long a puck was in play. Each table features a bonus puck to find. Players can collect stars, and upon collecting enough of them, they will be able to choose to go to a Bonus Stage or collect bonus points instead. Development The development of Galactic Pinball was managed by Gunpei Yokoi, who also created the Virtual Boy. It was directed by Kenji Yamamoto, who composed the sound alongside Masaru Tajima. It was shown during the Virtual Boy's Las Vegas debut alongside Teleroboxer. It has been known at varying points as Space Pinball, Virtual Pinball, and Pinball VB. It was one of the launch games for the Virtual Boy, and was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and on August 14, 1995 in the United States. Like all Virtual Boy games, Galactic Pinball uses a red-and-black color scheme and parallax visuals to simulate three-dimensional depth. Reception Since its release, Galactic Pinball has received a mixed reception. Before its release, GamePro speculated that it might be \\"one of the best pinball games around.\\" On release, Weekly Famicom Ts≈´shin scored the game a 24 out of 40, while GamePro reviewer Slo Mo praised the diversity of tables, responsive controls, and innovative 3D stage design. Writer Jeremy Parish called it a quality pinball game for its time and felt that it would have been a better pack-in title than Mario's Tennis. An editor for IGN called it one of the best Virtual Boy games for its pinball gameplay and visual design. Retro Gamers Nick Thorpe felt that it was less popular than other Virtual Boy games, but deserved to be played. Outlets including Videogames and Retro Gamer praised it for its authenticity as a pinball game. Specific praises include its physics and sound design. A writer for ABC's Good Game program also praised its authenticity, but felt that it lacked ambition. Venture Beat writer Jeff Grubb was more negative on Galactic Pinball, calling it a bad Virtual Boy game due to being low effort as a pinball game. Galactic Pinball was reviewed by two GameFan editors, both of whom were not enthused with it. The first reviewer found it forgettable for people not interested in pinball games, while the other suggested avoiding it. Allgame disliked Galactic Pinball, feeling that the slow pace and unrealistic physics hurt it as a pinball experience. Outlets such as Electronic Entertainment and Nintendo Power praised the 3D design, the latter voting it the fourth best Virtual Boy game of 1995 due in part to the limited use of 3D. A reviewer for Nintendo Power however criticized the limited 3D as well as a lack of a battery save for high scores. PC Magazines Benj Edwards included it among his list of seven \\"forgotten Nintendo Virtual Boy classics.\\" He cites Yokoi's interest in the Virtual Boy's black space as a way to convey \\"infinite space behind the playfield,\\" and speculates that this was the origin of Galactic Pinball. A writer for Electronic Gaming Monthly found the level design excellent but that the flippers were too slow to respond. Kill Screen writer Jon Irwin similarly criticized its physics, stating that slowdown occurred whenever the puck approached the flippers. He felt that the action and physics were better in the Space Pinball demo than the final release. Next Generation was critical of Galactic Pinball due to poor lasting value. Tim Stevens for Engadget criticized the sound effects, in particular the lack of sound for the puck. He speculated that it was due to the digital voice work taking up too much room on the cartridge.

One of the richest businessman in the country, he funded the Central Asian state's Socialist Party. He had announced his candidacy for the presidency in the July 2005 elections, but bowed down long before the vote, when his party supported former security chief and Bishkek mayor, Felix Kulov. Starting out as a worker at a tobacco factory in his hometown of Osh in the south, Erkinbayev made his fame as a wrestler, and served in parliament for a decade. He went on to own \\"Kara Suu\\", Central Asia‚Äôs largest bazaar. Erkinbayev was a key figure behind the March 2005 events, where around 2,000 of his martial arts trainees moved across the southern cities of Jalal-Abad, Osh, and Batken, capturing government sites, burning down police stations, and blocking key highways. The protests later moved to the capital, Bishkek, and ousted longtime President Askar Akayev from office on March 24. Erkinbayev gained much support by financing protests, and sending in martial arts trainees to lead the demonstrations. He was a devotee of Alysh, Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs answer to kung fu and was also the head of Kyrgyzstan's National Olympic Committee. Erkinbayev was lauded as a hero in his hometown of Osh after the revolution, when some 20,000 people gathered in Osh‚Äôs main square to celebrate the regime‚Äôs fall. He was reported to exercise strong influence over small businesses in the Osh region, and was widely rumoured to be associated with the criminal world. Erkinbayev operated at the turbulent intersection where politics, business, sports and, sometimes, crime meet in post-Soviet Central Asia. The Kyrgyz parliament, however, had refused prosecutors' attempts to strip him of legal immunity. Erkinbayev survived an assassination attempt on April 28, 2005, in which he was shot at from a car, and sported a bandage over his nose. He believed that the motive was political, but also felt that it could have been an attempt to wrestle control of his business empire. On September 22, 2005, however, Erkinbayev sustained bullet wounds to his neck and chest, when he was attacked by unidentified assailants from behind some bushes after arriving home by car late that day. He died in hospital, aged 38.

The family is related to the politically prominent Jinnah family‚ÄîNeville Wadia was married to Dina Jinnah‚Äîthe only child of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Rattanbai Petit. The present head of the house is Nusli Wadia, son of Neville and Dina, who runs the Wadia Group of companies. The Wadia family has three main branches: textiles, shipping, and jewellery. Descendants from each of these branches have made significant contributions to their fields, to their communities, to India, and to the global economy; they have been industrialists, government leaders, medical doctors, and scholars. History Lovji Nusserwanjee Wadia advanced the Wadia shipbuilding dynasty in 1736, when he obtained a contract from the British East India Company for building docks and ships in Bombay (present-day Mumbai). Although the Wadias would eventually come to be considered a Bombay family, many of them remained in Surat, where one branch of the family established a ship breaking yard (where ships are dismantled) that remains one of the largest of its kind in the world. The poem whose words would become the lyrics of The Star-Spangled Banner, the national anthem of the United States, were written in 1812 on board a Wadia-built British Royal Navy ship, by Francis Scott Key. By the 1840s, the family was one of the leading forces in the Indian shipbuilding industry. At that time they had built over a hundred warships for Britain, and had trading networks around the world. The prominent women of the Wadia family, including Motlibai Maneckji Wadia, Jerbai Nusserwanji Wadia, and Lady Hirabai Cowasji Jehangir, were known for their philanthropy in providing financial support to Zoroastrian temples, establishing schools and hospitals, and supporting the arts in the 1800s. More recently, Neville Wadia continued the philanthropic tradition of his family by continuing to establish hospitals and schools. The Wadia family has endowed Nowrosjee Wadia College in Pune. Lovji Nusserwanjee Wadia's great grandsons, JBH Wadia and Homi Wadia founded Wadia Movietone in 1933, which had its studios at Lovji Castle (Lovejee Castle) in Chembur, Mumbai, India. The company has a ship as its logo, honoring their family legacy. The family is related to Pakistan's politically prominent Jinnah family, through Neville Wadia, who was married to Dina Jinnah from 1938 to 1943, and had two children together, Diana and Nusli Wadia. Dina was the daughter of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Rattanbai Petit, the former is the founder of Pakistan, while the later was the daughter of Sylla Tata and Dinshaw Maneckji Petit. Though Dina took divorce from Neville in 1943, she remained a prominent member of the Wadia family.

However, it was from the √Åguas Purificadoras and Preciso de Ti albums that it acquired international recognition, becoming the largest worship ministry in Latin America and one of the world's largest ministries of praise, worship and mission. It is also considered one of the most successful bands in Brazilian music. In a single presentation, held on 10 July 2003, during the recording of the album, Quero Me Apaixonar, Diante do Trono gathered about 2 million people at Campo de Marte Airport, in S√£o Paulo, being the largest public of a Christian event already registered in the world, and the second largest public of Brazil, losing only to the festival Rock In Rio. The band has also been a winner of Talent and Promises Awards, and was nominated for the Latin Grammy in 2012 with the album Sol da Justi√ßa. The group has sold over 15 million albums, one of the record holders for music sales in Brazil. For its first decade and a half, the band had brass and string sections. It has had several instrumental changes throughout its career, especially the period of the years 2011 and 2012, when the only members that remained from the initial group were lead vocalist Ana Paula Valad√£o and rhythm guitarist Elias Fernandes. The band's sound became noticeably more pop rock with the removal of its brass and string sections, and is characterized by congregational singing, with influences of pop rock, progressive rock and folk. Diante do Trono, in partnership with the Lagoinha Church, has promoted over the years several social, humanitarian and missionary actions, having part of its profits from the sales of CDs and DVDs destined for initiatives such as India Project, which combats human trafficking, collecting and helping Indian girls in prostitution, as well as other occasional actions promoted during some of its live album recordings in Brazil and the Middle East. The group also has part of its discography entirely aimed at children, the Crian√ßas Diante do Trono. The group also created the Ministerial Training Center Diante do Trono (CTMDT), a preparatory center for musicians and singers in the area of missions, as well as the Arts Factory, which is a partnership with Lagoinha Church, to train professionals in various areas such as singing, theater and dance.  History  1997‚Äì2001: The beginning = In 1997, the group was formed in the church in 1997.Tiago Melo, Diante do Trono comemora 15 anos com grava√ß√£o de DVD em Manaus, globo.com, Brazil, February 8, 2012 The songs would be composed or versioned by Ana Paula Valad√£o herself, who would also take the lead in praise, while S√©rgio Gomes would be responsible for the instrumental arrangement. The musicians responsible for this recording were Lagoinha praise ministers. To this end, rehearsals began later that year and the material for the album was recorded live on 31 January 1998, at a worship service at the Lagoinha Church in Belo Horizonte. Along with Ana Paula, the vocals were formed by other singers such as Andr√© Valad√£o, his brother, N√≠vea Soares and Soraya Gomes, wife of S√©rgio Gomes. A few months after the recording, the musical work was released, having an initial print run only for members of the local church, but was later distributed throughout Brazil independently. The name of the album was called Diante do Trono. Many songs from that recording began to be performed on radio stations and churches in various parts of Brazil, especially \\"Aclame ao Senhor\\", \\"Deus de Amor\\", \\"Manancial\\" and \\"Te Agrade√ßo\\". Logo adopted by the band. With the positive repercussion and commercial success of the album, the ministry of praise decided to continue, taking the name of the first release: \\"Diante do Trono\\". In the following months, the members of the group began to consolidate, with the entrance of the couple Helena Tannure and Jo√£o L√∫cio Tannure, besides the vocal arranger Maximiliano Moraes. Thus, on 13 February 1999, again at Lagoinha Church, was recorded the second album of the series, entitled Exaltado, highlighting the songs \\"A Ele a Gloria\\", \\"Quero Ser\\" and \\"Amigo Fiel\\". From Exaltado, the Diante do Trono began to perform throughout Brazil and the band's popularity began to grow among evangelicals, the name of the group was consolidating with their trips to Brazilian states and their expressive sale of records. In 2000, the 1st Conference of Praise and Worship Diante do Trono was held, also at the Lagoinha Church. This has undergone some name changes over the years, but continues to be held annually on Holy Week holiday in Belo Horizonte. For the recording of the group's third album, the Lagoinha temple no longer held the public interested in participating, so, on 15 July 2000, the album √Åguas Purificadoras was recorded at Parque da Gameleira, Belo Horizonte, gathering about of seventy thousand people and had the arrival of new band members, such as Graziela Santos and Mariana Valad√£o. This album had even more impact among the congregational praises of several Brazilian churches, with special success of the title song. That same year, The Throne, in partnership with the American label Hosanna! Music, recorded two musical works: Aclame ao Senhor, Portuguese version of the album Shout to The Lord, by Australian Hillsong praise leader Darlene Zschech, and Shalom Jerusal√©m, consisting of songs with Jewish rhythm featuring the singer and American worship leader Paul Wilbur. In 2000, the group founded a house for young girls in India to combat prostitution. Tadeu Ribeiro, Ana Paula Valad√£o conta que vendeu sua casa para manter obra mission√°ria na √çndia, portaldotrono.com, Brazil, April 16, 2017 In 2001, the group released the fourth album of the Diante do Trono's series: Preciso de Ti, recorded on 14 July of that year at the Mineir√£o Stadium in Belo Horizonte, bringing together about two hundred and ten thousand people, this was the record of public in the history of the Minas Gerais stadium. The work sold four hundred thousand copies in the week of release and subsequently surpassed the two million mark sold, making it an unprecedented success in the history of Brazilian Christian music, with all of its songs being performed on likes radios and churches all over Brazil. In addition to their commercial success, the band gained media recognition and criticism, winning the Talent Awards in 2002 in the Best Music category for \\"Preciso de Ti\\" and Best Group. Still in 2001, the first album of the collection Crian√ßas Diante do Trono was released, with its works directed to children. The eponymous work would become the first in a series of children's albums, and the song \\"Aos Olhos do Pai\\" became one of the group's biggest hits, also among the adult audience. = 2001‚Äì2006: Vision \\"Brasil Diante do Trono\\" = In late 2001, Ana Paula Valad√£o said she received a vision from God that showed that the Diante do Trono should hold gatherings for Brazil, so that the nation in unity would pray and intercede for the country. To this end, the group, which had hitherto concentrated in Belo Horizonte for their live recordings, began to hold gatherings throughout all regions of Brazil, and as the beginning of this project, on 1 December 2001, in Maracan√£ Stadium, in Rio de Janeiro, with an audience of more than 180,000 people, was recorded the album Brasil Diante do Trono, which was a collection with recordings of songs released by the group in the first four albums. On 13 July 2002, in continuation of the \\"Brasil Diante do Trono\\" project, it was recorded at the Ministries Esplanade in Bras√≠lia, Federal District, attended by over one million two hundred thousand people, from caravans from all over Brazil, the fifth album of the Diante do Trono's series, called Nos Bra√ßos do Pai. It was the first time that a musical event was held at that venue and to this day it was the largest stage ever built for the Diante do Trono's recordings, which brought together vocalists, band, orchestra, choir and dancers. The album contained songs with the theme of divine fatherhood and again was commercial and critical success. In 2006, the album also gained versions of the Diante do Trono itself in English and Spanish, but as of 2002, the group began making international trips showing their work in other countries, performing as in Guatemala and Japan. In 2003, N√≠vea Soares decided to start a solo career and recorded her first album, Reina Sobre Mim, but without leaving the group. On 12 July 2003, the group recorded the sixth album of the Diante do Trono's series and the third of the \\"Brasil Diante do Trono\\" project: Quero Me Apaixonar, which featured a theme of love for God and repentance, as well as a remix version of the song \\"Manancial\\". The recording took place at Campo de Marte Airport, in the north of S√£o Paulo, and had an audience of over two million people, a record for the group. In this event the band collected 35 tons of food, which were distributed in the north of Minas Gerais. At that year's Talent Awards, the band took two of their three nominations. Soon after recording the CD Quero Me Apaixonar in S√£o Paulo, the Diante do Trono went through a period of change covering the entire internal and administrative structure of the group, which remained independent, with its own record label. In 2004, Andr√© Valad√£o followed in the footsteps of N√≠vea Soares and began his solo career with the work Mais Que Abundante parallel to the group's work. That same year, the seventh work, Esperan√ßa, was recorded at the Bahia Administrative Center in Salvador, on 10 July 2004, bringing together about one million two hundred thousand people, according to data from the Bahia Military Police, and had the sound of the Bahian group Tambores Ungidos in the song \\"Quem √© Deus Como o Nosso Deus?\\". In the recording Ana Paula shared with the audience her difficulty getting pregnant and brought a message of encouragement, faith and hope. At the Talent Awards, the band was the highlight, winning seven out of eight nominations. Also in 2004, Diante do Trono founded in Santa Luzia the Diante do Trono Ministerial Training Center (CTMDT), whose mission was to prepare people to work in areas such as praise and missions, in Brazil and around the world. At the beginning of 2005 Maximiliano Moraes left the group, which, at S√©rgio Gomes' request, still worked on the vocal arrangement of the group's next album, but was no longer part of the band's vocal. On 9 July 2005, the Diante do Trono recorded the album Ainda Existe Uma Cruz in Porto Alegre, on the banks of the Gua√≠ba River, attended by over three hundred thousand people and marked by Ana Paula Valad√£o being pregnant with her first child, a year after she shared her difficulty getting pregnant. The theme of the album came against the Brazilian Christian market, bringing a message that the gospel of Christ brings responsibilities and that it is an arduous path, as in the title song, in addition to \\"Quero Seguir-Te\\" and \\"Cora√ß√£o Todo Teu\\". The work maintained its excellence of compositions and productions. During the Talent Awards, the group won in three categories. The following year, on the night of 15 July 2006, the band went to Bel√©m do Par√°, a city the group called the \\"Gateway of the Amazon\\", for the recording of the album Por Amor de Ti, Oh Brasil, the ninth from the Diante do Trono's series, recorded live at the Yamada Arena, which was attended by over eighty thousand people. The album received mixed reception from the public and critics, and kept songs of praise and worship to God, and a theme of intercession for the nation, with emphasis on \\"Na Terra Seca\\", \\"Rei dos Reis\\" and \\"Tu Reinas\\", the latter that marked much of the audience in the arena, as well as the band itself, spontaneously bending their knees in worship of God. Also that year was released Sem Palavras, the first instrumental album of the group. In the Talent Awards, the group won mostly in the children's album categories. = 2007‚Äì2010: New cycles = In 2007, the ministry of praise completed 10 years of its formation. In celebration of the group's first decade, Diante do Throne recorded the album Tempo de Festa live at Via Funchal in S√£o Paulo, which was a commemorative double CD and DVD featuring the theme songs from each of the first nine albums from Diante do Trono's series, as well as hits such as \\"Manancial\\", \\"Tempo de Festa\\" and the unreleased song \\"Amado Salvador\\", composed by the band leader especially for this work. In addition to the show, the DVD contained a documentary telling the group's story and messages from girls who were rescued by the missionary project in India, which originated the album recordings. It was also the last project that featured pastor Renata Valad√£o on vocals, which after this album, definitely left the group for health reasons. According to expert critics, the weak point of the event was the lack of innovation. At the International Conference of Praise and Worship that year, the group recorded a second CD and DVD in celebration of 10 years: Com Intensidade, which features only the celebration songs recorded by the group so far. After the commemorative recordings, the group began preparations for the recording of their tenth album of the Diante do Trono's series. Having fulfilled the call to hold strategic gatherings in all regions of Brazil, the group felt inspired to end the cycle in the city of the first recording of the vision \\"Brasil Diante do Trono\\", Rio de Janeiro, but this time with an album of songs unpublished. The group scheduled the event to take place on 7 July 2007. Initially, the group wanted to record in Pra√ßa da Apoteose, but there was no authorization from the local government, because the same day would happen in Rio the event \\"Live Earth\\", which would require a great attention from the security of the city. The work clomplted the Brasil Diante do Trono collection, with recordings in all regions of Brazil. However, there was a prior authorization to hold the event at Aterro do Flamengo, so the group even announced the venue of the event, however, the Rio de Janeiro authorities did not grant all the necessary authorizations for recording at that location and the event was transferred exactly to Pra√ßa da Apoteose, place where the Samba Schools Parade of Rio de Janeiro is traditionally held during Carnival. The change was celebrated by the group, who for years pray and prophesy for the end of Carnival in Brazil, so that place was strategic and representative for them. Thus, on 7 July 2007, the Diante do Trono recorded the album Pr√≠ncipe da Paz, with an audience of over 100,000 people. In one of the moments of the recording, Ana Paula Valad√£o again prophesied against the carnival and received from the city hall the symbolic keys of Rio de Janeiro. The album was divided into two moments, the first being marked by strong guitar and brass arrangements, as in the song \\"Cordeiro e Le√£o\\", and a controversial lyrics for the song \\"Mais Que Vencedor\\", and a second moment with lyrics and introspective arrangements, as for the songs \\"Esp√≠rito de Vida\\" and \\"Autor da Vida\\". The work also marked the entry of Marine Friesen as the group's vocal backing, as well as Daniel Friesen and Vinicius Bruno in the band, all former students of CTMDT. The work was considered as the end of the \\"Brasil Diante do Trono\\" cycle, with recordings in all five regions of Brazil. In the Talent Awards it was the same as the previous year: the group won mostly in the children's categories, but received positive reviews for the work. In January 2008, Diante do Trono entered into a partnership to distribute the works of the group Trazendo a Arca through the independent label of Diante do Trono, as well as with solo albums by N√≠vea Soares and Andr√© Valad√£o. The purpose of the partnership was to strengthen both groups against piracy. In May 2008, the Diante do Trono first went to a nationally screened TV show and was honored on the Raul Gil Program on BAND channel. The program told the story of the band and other Christian musicians, such as David Quinlan, Marina de Oliveira, Aline Barros, Trazendo a Arca and Adhemar de Campos, paid tribute to the group. On 4 and 5 July, at the Chevrolet Hall in Recife, the group recorded the eleventh album of the Diante do Trono's series: A Can√ß√£o do Amor. The album took up the concept of the album Quero Me Apaixonar released in 2003, but with a more explicit focus, being all about the love of God towards his children and children with God, as in the title song and \\"Porque Te Amo\\". Also that year, Mariana Valad√£o started her solo career, released an eponymous album, and decided to leave the group. In 2009, during the International Conference of Praise and Worship Diante do Trono, the group even announced that the traditional recording of that year would take place in Manaus, but the group again had difficulties with bureaucratic issues to make the recording possible. With this, after eight years, the group went back to recording an album of the Diante do Trono's series in their hometown, Belo Horizonte, and so occurred on 1 August 2009, at Pra√ßa da Esta√ß√£o. This twelfth album was called Tua Vis√£o and carried a message of confidence in God's will. The album marked the entrance of a new generation of musicians coming from CTMDT, especially vocalists Ana N√≥brega and Israel Salazar. It was also the first to feature a participation of another name known in the Brazilian Christian milieu, Fernanda Brum, in a vocal trio along with Ana Paula Valad√£o and N√≠vea Soares in the song \\"Encontro das √Åguas\\". According to expert critics, the work confirmed the need for a musical renewal in the group. Soon after the album was recorded, a partnership was announced between Diante do Trono and Som Livre record label, which would distribute the group's CDs and DVDs throughout Brazil, in addition to opening the doors for regional and national disclosures by Rede Globo and its affiliates. That year, Ana Paula Valad√£o, along with her family, moved to Dallas, in the United States, which made the group's ministrations at Lagoinha Church happen under the vocal leadership of Ana N√≥brega and Israel Salazar, and Ana Paula returned to Brazil whenever needed for ministry throughout Brazil. In 2010, during the International Conference of Praise and Worship Diante do Trono, the group announced that that year would be the thirteenth album of the Diante do Trono's series in the city of Barretos. The event was supported by a council of pastors of the city and would take place at the Arena do Pe√£o, a place where traditional festivals in the Brazilian countryside traditionally take place. On the day of the recording, the band did a social work in partnership with Barretos Cancer Hospital, promoting a bone marrow donation campaign. The album recorded there was called Aleluia and was, at the time, the most pop rock of the band, joining the sound of guitars with the brass of the orchestra, in addition to the re-recording of \\"Este √© o Dia\\" in country rhythm and the participation of the singer Ludmila Ferber in the re-recording of the song \\"Eis-me Aqui\\". The song \\"Can√ß√£o do Apocalipse\\" was very successful among the churches of the country, being performed on likes radios around Brazil, the album became the best selling Christian work of 2010 in Brazil. After the release of Aleluia, the group performed for the first time on a Rede Globo TV show, Doming√£o do Faust√£o, where they sang \\"Preciso de Ti\\" and \\"Tempo de Festa\\", in addition to talking with Fausto Silva, participation raised the audience of the program on that date. = 2011‚Äì2013: Structural changes = The ministry of praise Diante do Trono began in 2011 with a significantly different formation, because the brass orchestra, conductor S√©rgio Gomes and some vocals such as Helena and Jo√£o L√∫cio Tannure couples, Clay Peterson and Graziela Santos, as well as Soraya Gomes officially left the group, accompanying others who were already pursuing solo careers, such as N√≠vea Soares, Andr√© Valad√£o and Mariana Valad√£o. The only members of the group's initial formation that remained were Ana Paula Valad√£o and Elias Fernandes, other band members were former CTMDT students, some of them had been joining the Diante do Trono since 2007 and 2009, others joined the group as the drummer Tiago Ga√∫cho. With this new formation, besides the return of Ana Paula Valad√£o's residence to Brazil, it allowed the group to increase the number of live musical performances in Brazil and abroad, besides bringing significant sound changes to the group's songs. These changes were announced to the public during the 12th International Conference of Praise and Worship, which also marked the beginning of a musical and ministerial exchange with the American group Gateway Worship, from the recording of the album Gl√≥ria a Deus, a Portuguese version of one of Gateway's works. In addition, the band continued with the distribution of their productions by Som Livre, making their administrative area leaner. Still in 2011, the Diante do Trono was the hometown of Natal for the recording of the fourteenth album of Diante do Trono's series: Sol da Justi√ßa. The group gathered an audience of more than 120,000 people on 16 July 2011, in Praia do Meio, but the bad weather conditions hindered the completion of the stage assembly, making the event was held again at the Riachuelo Theater, on 18 July, but this time with the planned scenographic structure. The album was a new milestone in the group's history, achieving great commercial success. The song \\"Me Ama\\" was one of the most performed on radio stations and churches throughout Brazil. In just one day of release the album sold over fifty thousand copies. During the Promises Awards ceremony in 2011, the group was the most awarded, winning in the Best Ministry of Praise and Best DVD categories.

The event also featured the special appearances of Ludmila Ferber, Thomas Miller, Mariana Valad√£o, Felippe Valad√£o, among other musicians. The work received positive reviews from the specialized media, and received considerable acclaim from the public, selling 50,000 copies in just one day.

On 6 July 2013, the Diante do Trono gathered about 30,000 people at the Padre Cicero Event Park in Juazeiro do Norte, for the recording of the sixteenth album of the Diante do Trono's series, entitled Tu Reinas. In addition to the main gathering, the group toured small communities in the northeastern backlands and recorded the same songs more intimately in an unprecedented initiative, as an incentive for social and missionary actions in one of the poorest regions of Brazil that suffered that year with one of the worst droughts ever recorded in the region.

Since the first album, the group has had roots of congregational singing in instrumental part. The band's orchestra was a hallmark of the group's works released between 1998 and 2010, making the heavy, dense sound of brass the main musical feature of the group. The departure of the band's orchestra brought a renewal of the group's arrangements from the 2011 album Sol da Justi√ßa. Since then, the Diante do Trono has taken on pop rock influences in their arrangements. The Diante do Trono's main musical references are from foreign worship ministries, notably the Australian group Hillsong and the American group Gateway Worship. The Brazilian band even recorded several albums in partnership with these ministries. Another reference of the band is the American group Jesus Culture, which had some of their versioned songs, such as \\"Can√ß√£o do Apocalipse\\" from the album Aleluia, \\"Me Ama\\" from the album Sol da Justi√ßa, and \\"Santo\\" from the album Tu Reinas. The song \\"Aclame ao Senhor\\" featured on the album Diante do Trono was another notable version of Hillsong leader Darlene Zschech. In addition to influencing various church worship ministries in Brazil, the Diante do Trono also influenced Brazilian musicians, such as the Evangelical group Toque no Altar/Trazendo a Arca, and the Catholic singer Marcelo Rossi, who re-recorded the song \\"Seja o Centro\\" , from the album Quero Me Apaixonar, in his album Minha Ben√ß√£o, released in 2006.  Other projects  Crian√ßas Diante do Trono = The Crian√ßas Diante do Trono project started from a desire of the band to take their songs in language aimed at children, using animated characters and children from Lagoinha Church. The first album aimed at children was the Crian√ßas Diante do Trono, released in 2001. The album was very successful, besides containing the song \\"Aos Olhos do Pai\\", which is one of the band's best known songs by the general public. After the good repercussion of the work, they launched eight more: Amigo de Deus, Quem √© Jesus?, Vamos Compartilhar, A Arca de No√©, Samuel, o Menino que Ouviu Deus, Para Adorar ao Senhor, Amigos do Perd√£o, Davi, Renovo Kids and DT Babies were released. Some versions of the Crian√ßas Diante do Tono's series were even produced in other languages for distribution in countries such as Poland and others in Eastern Europe. The goal would be to promote evangelism through the Christian language-language messages contained in the group's productions. Through albums, the group has won the Talent Awards for several years and is recognized for producing some of the highest quality children's albums in the Brazilian music market. = Ministerial Training Center Diante do Trono (CTMDT) = In the year 2000, when Pastor Jo√£o Osmar and his wife, Pastor Lylian Abucater, were at the head of the Teenagers Network of Lagoinha Church and because of the couple's missionary experience with YWAM (Youth with a Mission, missionary institution). Jo√£o Osmar suggested that Lagoinha, within the teenagers ministry, should develop a missionary training to go to the nations. Pastor M√°rcio Valad√£o (Senior of Lagoinha Church) then gave support to start the project of qualification and formation in the church. On a site in Melo Viana the first pillars of this project were founded, which was initially called CFMDT (Missionary Training Center Diante do Trono). With the school began a work of evangelism and cells in the homes of the region. In order to optimize this vision, namely the local church association, praise and worship and missions, the idea of the creation of the Ministerial Training Center Diante do Trono (CTMDT) as a school was born in mid-2003, that could relate praise and worship and cross-cultural missions. After a while, in 2004 the project was born, the vision broadened and the couple Gustavo Bessa and Ana Paula Valad√£o took over the direction of the Seminar, joining efforts with Jo√£o and Lylian to achieve this project. The group acquired a property in Santa Luzia and in 2005, CTMDT was established in this headquarters that has a housing building with 52 suites and capacity for over 200 people, a recreation area with two swimming pools, a sports court and gardens, a restaurant and industrial kitchen, and an educational building with several classrooms. In 2009, with Gustavo Bessa and Ana Paula Valad√£o going to the United States, the couple Clay Peterson and Graziela Santos, vocalists of the Diante do Trono, took over in support of Jo√£o and Lyllian. At CTMDT, there were names like Marine Friesen, Ana N√≥brega and Israel Salazar, and some music albums were produced by downtown classes, such as the Viver Por Ti, N√£o Haver√° Limites and Tu √âs Tudo Para Mim CDs, as well as from the EP Dependente. Missionary work was also the fruit of CTMDT, such as missions carried out in the Amazon, Sert√£o, Europe, Africa and elsewhere. At the end of 2017, Diante do Trono informed that from 2018, would not have the courses in the format of boarding school. However, they would be evaluating the possibility of implementing the Distance Learning system, which would allow the continued application of content and also the participation of students from various parts of Brazil and the world, and with this readjustment, we can cover a lot more people and churches, and make a significant contribution to the formation of the Church. = Diante do Trono's conferences = Since 2000, the ministry of praise Diante do Trono promotes during the Holy Week holiday a conference in the city of Belo Horizonte, bringing together people from various parts of Brazil and the world who usually organize in caravans to attend the traditional event. The conference promotes worship services, chats and preaching with Diante do Trono members or national and international guests, focusing on Bible-related themes and context, as well as moments of intercession and worship of God. Until 2013 the event was titled International Conference of Praise and Worship Diante do Trono, from 2014 to 2015 it was called Conference of Worship and Intercession Diante do Trono and since 2016 it is called Conference of Worship, Intercession and Mission Diante do Trono. From 2000 to 2002 the event took place in the temple of Lagoinha Church, from 2003 to 2007 it took place at Mineirinho Gymnasium, in 2008 it took place at Chevrolet Hall, from 2009 to 2011 it happened again at Lagoinha Church, from 2012 to 2014 it took place at Expominas and since 2015 again returned to the temple of Lagoinha Church. The events are recorded on video and broadcast on DVD/VHS, via the Rede Super or through the band's YouTube channel. Some recordings of albums have already been recorded during the conferences, such as the Mais Que Abundante, Milagres and Alegria albums by Andr√© Valad√£o, Rio, by N√≠vea Soares, Com Intensidade, Gl√≥ria a Deus, Renovo, Imers√£o 2, Imers√£o 3 and Outra Vez, by Diante do Trono. In 2011, also at Lagoinha Church, the band created the Women Diante do Trono Conference, led by Ana Paula Valad√£o. And from 2015, parallel to the women's event, the Men Diante do Trono Conference, led by Gustavo Bessa, took place. And since 2017 the two conferences have been unified, so-called Men and Women Diante do Trono Conference, taking place in the main temple of Lagoinha and, according to Gustavo Bessa, is for men and women, both married couples, as well as single, divorced and married. widowed. The purpose of these events is to focus the family in the light of the Bible, and in this sense, various chats, preaching, as well as praise, worship and intercession are promoted. The events are also broadcast on Rede Super and the band's YouTube channel. Some compact and traveling versions of these Diante do Trono-sponsored conferences eventually take place in other cities in Brazil. = Miss√£o DT = Since recording the Diante do Trono's first album in 1998, the group has aimed to develop missionary and social projects, especially in India, where Pastor Marcio Valad√£o, along with a pastoral team from Lagoinha Church, had visited in 1997 and sensitized with a strong scenario of child prostitution. So Ana Paula Valad√£o and S√©rgio Gomes took on the challenge of recording an album where part of the proceeds went to Church missionary action in India. With the success of the group formed by them, the Diante do Trono since 2000 has been developing a social project in the Indian territory that provides integral care for girls who lived in various situations of risk and vulnerability. More than 500 girls have been reached and cared for, including housing, food, education, English classes, vocational courses, medical and spiritual care. And in 2017, during the Conference of Worship, Intercession and Mission Diante do Trono, held annually in Belo Horizonte, Ana Paula, together with her husband Gustavo Bessa, announced the creation of the project \\"Miss√£o DT\\", which is the unification in a single project all the social and missionary actions developed by the Diante do Trono. Currently, in addition to India Project, the Israel Project has been announced, which encourages missionary work in the Israeli nation and promotes social action for Syrian and Iraqi refugees in Jordan. And in Brazil, Sert√£o Project, focused on the area that, according to the group, is the least evangelized region in the country, the group has promoted actions such as the recording of the album Tu Reinas in 2013 and the band's conferences to draw the attention of Brazil and the world to the needs of the Brazilian Sert√£o, in addition, the group is linked to other partners who have since received support from the ministry so that not only the Gospel is taken to the needy people, but also, so that they have decent human conditions to live. = Diante do Trono's label = Since its first album, released in 1998, Diante do Trono has worked on the production, dissemination and distribution of its materials independently. In 2003, after an internal administrative overhaul, the group officially created their own record label, bearing the group's name and having a track record of highly successful material in Brazil, such as the albums √Åguas Purificadoras, Preciso de Ti and Nos Bra√ßos do Pai. In addition to the group's own materials, N√≠vea Soares was part of the label's casting with her first three albums from 2003 to 2007, Reina Sobre Mim, Enche-me de Ti and Rio, and Andr√© Valad√£o also with his first six albums from 2004 to 2008, Mais Que Abundante, Milagres, Alegria, Cl√°ssicos, Sobrenatural and Cl√°ssicos de Natal. Both N√≠vea Soares and Andr√© Valad√£o had direct links with the Diante do Trono as they were also vocalists of the group, the Diante do Trono also worked with the albums of Crian√ßas Diante do Trono and CTMDT. In 2008, the Diante do Trono announced that they would also distribute albums from a group that had not had a direct link to the group, the Trazendo a Arca, with the albums Marca da Promessa and Ao Vivo no Jap√£o. The initiative would be to combat piracy, joining forces in the Brazilian Christian music market without having any direct ministerial involvement. However, in 2009, the record label Diante do Trono ended its activities and the band signed a disclosure and distribution agreement with Som Livre, from Grupo Globo. The partnership between the band and the record label Som Livre lasted until 2014, when the group became independent again and released two albums of their own, Tu Reinas and Tetelestai, in addition to the album Jesus, by Israel Salazar, band's vocalist. In 2015, the group signed a contract with Onimusic, which has since been responsible for the dissemination and distribution of works produced by Diante do Trono.  Recognition  Throughout its career, the Diante do Trono has achieved remarkable marks for a Christian music band: it was the only Brazilian gospel ensemble to receive a tribute on a television show; has performed for more than two million people at a concert in the city of S√£o Paulo; besides being the only band participating in Promises Festival. The group has already toured in Europe, the United States, Asia, among other places. Specialist criticism considers that the whole is diversified in its compositions, with deep lyrics, poetry, words that bring repentance, among other subjects.

Awards and nominations  During its years of existence, the Diante do Trono received 61 nominations in Talent Awards between the 2002 and 2009. Of the 61 indications it received, it won in 24, or 39.3% of them. The most successful year of the set was that of 2004, when they received 8 nominations and won in 7.

Covering 8.5 square kilometers, it falls under the jurisdiction of Jezreel Valley Regional Council. In it had a population of . Nahalal is best known for its general layout, as designed by Richard Kauffmann: slightly oval round, similar to a spoke wheel with its public buildings at the \\"hub\\" and individual plots of agricultural land radiating from it like spokes with symmetrically placed roads creating eight equal sectors, an inner ring of residential buildings, and an outer ring road.Richard Kauffmann, Die Bebauungsplaene der Kleinsiedlungen Kfar-Nahalal und Kfar-Jecheskiel ('The construction plans for the agricultural small housing estates Kfar Nahalal and Kfar Jecheskiel'), published by the Department for Agricultural Colonization of the Zionist Executive, Jerusalem (1923), in German. In the Hebrew Bible Nahalal was a Levitical city mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. According to the Book of Joshua, Nahalal, also transliterated Nahallal, was located in the territory of the tribe of Zebulun () and given to the Merarite division of the Levite tribe (). In the Book of Judges it is referred to as Nahalol (). HistoryAntiquity= Archaeological findings in the area suggest human settlement there dates to the Bronze Age, and continued into the Iron Age, Persian era, Hellenistic period, Roman era, and Byzantine era. Among the artifacts found was an ancient Jewish inscription of the word \\"Sabbath\\" on a rock, from Nahalal or nearby Shimron.Mordechai Aviam (2011). \\"The Sabbath Boundary at Timrat\\". In Eretz Magazine. A Hebrew version of the article is also available. =Ottoman Empire: Ma'alul= An Arab village in the area, Ma'alul, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517. It was identified with the biblical Nahalal by Rabbi Joseph Schwarz in 1850. =20th century=Arab village of Ma'alul By the 20th century, Ma'alul's inhabitants were tenants of the Sursuq family of Beirut, absentee landlords who had acquired the land earlier. In 1921, they sold all but 2,000 dunams of Ma'alul's land to the Zionist Palestine Land Development Company.a total of 16,000 dunams, with 90 families, according to List of villages sold by Sursocks and their partners to the Zionists since British occupation of Palestine, evidence to the Shaw Commission, 1930 Moshe Dayan mentioned Nahalal as an example of \\"there is not one place built in this country which did not have a former Arab population\\". Moshav Nahalal Nahalal in 1932 Nahalal was the first moshav ovdim (workers' cooperative agricultural settlement) in Mandatory Palestine. Its founders immigrated to Palestine from Eastern Europe as part of the Second and Third Aliyah between 1904 and 1914, at the end of Ottoman rule. Some of them had been members of the first kibbutz, Degania. After working in farming communities for a decade, they dreamt of establishing an income-sharing farming community similar to a kibbutz, but they wanted to maintain the nuclear family and household structure (kibbutzim had communal dining and children were kept in separate housing, where they also slept). The founders first arrived to the lands given to them by the Jewish National Fund on September 11, 1921. They first saw the allotted land from the hill, noticing that small rivulets transformed the plain into marshes that attracted malaria- spreading anopheles mosquitoes. Heeding the warnings of experts, such as Dr. Hillel Yaffe, the Jewish pioneers temporarily settled on a nearby hill, near the Arab village of Ma'lul. Later they came down from the hill and divided the land, initially into 80 equal parcels, 75 to the members and 5 to Nahalal agricultural school. Nahalal school 1944 Nahalal 1945 Nahalal 1946 The physical layout of Nahalal, devised by architect Richard Kauffmann in 1921, became the pattern for many moshavim established before 1948; it is based on concentric circles, with the public buildings (school, administration offices, services, and warehouses) in the centre, the homes of non-farming families (craftsmen, teachers, etc.) around the centre, then a ring street with the farmers' homesteads bordering on it on the outside, and beyond those, ever- widening circles of gardens and fields. The equal parcelling of the land became the trademark geometric shape of Nahalal. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Nahalal had a population of 437 Jews. On 22 December 1932, a member of Nahalal and his son were killed when a bomb was thrown into their home. Education In 1929, a Girls' Agricultural Training Farm was established at Nahalal by Hana Meisel of the Women's International Zionist Organization, and in the 1940s it became a co- educational farming school of the Youth Aliyah movement.

No. 53/2012 ‚Äî Roads Act 1993 (Classification of National Roads) Order 2012, Irish Statute Book, 2012-02-28. The road also meets six regional roads along its route, and it is long (map). The government legislation that defines the N26, the S.I. No. 53/2012 ‚Äî Roads Act 1993 (Classification of National Roads) Order 2012, provides the following official description: :N26: Swinford ‚Äî Ballina, County Mayo :Between its junction with N5 at Kilbride in the county of Mayo and its junction with N59 at Lord Edward Street in the town of Ballina via Back Street and Main Street at Swinford; Clongullane Bridge, Callow; Chapel Road and Bridge Street at Foxford; Bellass, Drumrevagh, Carrowntreila and Rahans in the county of Mayo: Rahans Bridge at the boundary between the county of Mayo and the town of Ballina; Foxford Road, Station Road and Kevin Barry Street in the town of Ballina. This route was previously a national secondary road known as the N57 (leaving the N57 as a defunct route allocation). The route is Mayo's second busiest road after the N5, with almost 10,000 vehicles daily using the route between Ballina and Foxford. The route diverges from the N5 near Swinford and passes through that town. It runs northwest to Foxford, where the road meets the N58 (which runs south back to the N5). From here the route turns north to Ballina. At Ballina the road meets the N59, which runs east‚Äìwest through the town. The section between Foxford and Swinford is of very sub-standard quality and has an extremely narrow bridge over the River Moy at Callow, where two large vehicles cannot pass at the same time. The dangerous bridge is located on a double bend and interrupts the flow of traffic hugely. The N26 is the first \\"extra\\" allocation of a national primary route other than the original 25. There are now primary routes up to N33. The physical upgrading, or modernisation, of the road has been in the planning stages for over 10 years. The proposed upgrading of the N26 was divided into two phases with the first phase (5 km) just south of Ballina opening to traffic in December 2004, this new section eliminated a dangerous stretch and has much improved the approach into Ballina town. The second phase (19 km in length) from Carrowntrella-Bohola was planned to be of type two dual-carriageway standard and would have bypassed Foxford and Swinford. It would also have been the first dual carriageway ever constructed in Co Mayo and was to join the N5 just west of Bohola. However, planning permission for the project was denied by An Bord Pleanala in 2010 and the road is now being redesigned.

Early life and career Born in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, Valkyrien was prima ballerina of the Royal Danish Ballet. She married Danish nobleman and author, Baron Hrolf von Dewitz and in 1912 began appearing in motion pictures for Nordisk Film productions of Copenhagen. For them, she performed in at least six silent films including one feature-length production. Of these, the film Den St√¶rkeste (Vanquished) was an American/Danish production released in the United States by the Great Northern Film Company, the Nordisk Film subsidiary in New York City. This led to Valkyrien going to the U.S. where she was signed by the Bayonne, New Jersey, studio owner David Horsley. In 1914, she made her American film debut in the \\"Baroness Film Series\\" for Horsley's Centaur Film Company. Valda Valkyrien playing a young girl, probably in the 1916 Thanhouser production \\"Silas Marner.\\" If so, the older actor is Frederick Warde. Hollywood career With World War I raging in Europe, in 1915 a New York City publisher released her husband's book titled War's New Weapons which received considerable publicity. That same year, Thanhouser Studios capitalized on her husband's success and her aristocratic title, billing her as Baroness von Dewitz in a film about Norse mythology titled The Valkyrie. The resulting success brought Valda Valkyrien an offer from the Fox Film Corporation and in 1916 she signed on to make feature-length productions. However, the contractual relationship soured after one film and she left Fox to work in feature-length films back at Thanhouser as well as for Lewis J. Selznick's studio. Valkyrien's last film is probably her most remembered, although she had only a secondary role. Bolshevism on Trial was an anti- Marxist melodrama about a wealthy father who purchases an island off the coast of Florida and establishes a commune for his son in order to prove to the idealistic young man that communism can't work. Later life Before they divorced in 1919, Valkyrien's marriage to Hrolf von Dewitz had produced a son, Arden von Dewitz (1915‚Äì2004), who went on to become a successful painter in southern California. She married a second time to the New York industrialist Robert Stuart Otto with whom she had another child, Jean Otto. Valda Valkyrien moved to the West Coast where she lived until her death in Los Angeles in 1956 after a lengthy illness. She was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

It gives its name to the folly that stands at its top. The hill stands at high, and is a prominent landmark across Leicester and Leicestershire. Old John Tower The earliest recorded use of the name is on a map of 1754, which records a windmill on the site, some 30 years before the tower was built. The tower itself began life as a ruined folly, built in 1784, during the time of George Grey, 5th Earl of Stamford. He got Thomas Sketchley of Anstey to build him the mock ruin, which had strong similarities to Mow Cop, Staffordshire.Stevenson, Joan & Squires, Anthony (1999) Bradgate Park: Childhood Home of Lady Jane Grey, Kairos Press, , p. 55 It was adapted in the mid-19th century by the seventh Earl to serve as an observation tower for the practice circuit he laid out for his horses, along with the building of a stable block lower down the hill. It is well known for its \\"mug-shape\\" ‚Äî there was a longer section of wall adjoining the tower after the 19th century extension but this reduced in size over the years leaving the present 'handle' shape. The mug shape has given rise to false accounts of the tower's origins supposedly relating to a beer-loving miller who was killed after being hit by a pole during a bonfire. In the past it has also been used as a meeting place for hunters with their fox hounds, and a luncheon house for shooting parties in the park, prior to the park being donated for public use in 1928.Stevenson, Aubrey (1977) Get to Know Bradgate, Leicestershire County Council Libraries and Information Service, p. 17 Internally, the tower retains a number of 19th century fittings, including timber floors, slate fireplaces, shuttered windows and a castellated roof. The tower is a grade II listed building. A narrow spiral staircase gives access to the upper floor, and is open to visitors on the park's guided walk programmes.Bradgate Park Trust website accessed 7 November 2016 In 2001, Bradgate Park Trust registered the design of the building as a trademark, and in 2018 told a local artist that she would have to pay them if she continued to sell her paintings of it. Toposcope Adjacent to the tower is a toposcope installed in 1953. This was installed by the people of Newtown Linford from money raised at the 1953 'Pageant of Lady Jane Grey', performed to celebrate 400 years since she was proclaimed Queen of England.Stevenson, Joan, (1979) A Family Guide to Bradgate Park and Swithland Wood, Sycamore Press, p.27 War Memorial Leicestershire Yeomanry Memorial, Bradgate Park Old John Tower occupies the north-eastern end of a ridge.

Rankings  GameRankings collected and linked to (but did not host) reviews from other websites and magazines and averages specific ones. While hundreds of reviews may get listed, only the ones that GameRankings deemed notable were used for the average. Scores were culled from numerous American and European sources. The site used a percentage grade for all reviews in order to be able to calculate an average. However, because not all sites use the same scoring system (some rate out of 5 or 10, while others use a letter grade), GameRankings changed all other types of scores into percentages using a relatively straightforward conversion process. When a game accumulated six total reviews, it was given a ranking compared to all other games in the database and a ranking compared to games on its console. At the time of the site's closure in December 2019, seven games had an aggregate score of 97% or higher: Super Mario Galaxy, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Galaxy 2, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto IV, and Grand Theft Auto V.

It is registered in Spain and Delaware, and formerly operated from the Bahamas.  History and location  BIU was founded by Deric Bircham, William Martin, and Bircham's adopted son, Laurence Cheng Wen. According to its website, Bircham was established in Europe in 1992 and is also registered in Delaware (United States), Spain, and the Bahamas. John Bear, authority on distance education, wrote in the 2003 edition of Bears' Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning that Bircham's listed \\"delegation addresses [are] in Spain, England, United States (a Mail Boxes Etc. in Miami, Florida), Bahamas, Taiwan, China, Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Columbia, and New Zealand.\\" Bear's Guide states that \\"the offices in England and the Bahamas were strictly administrative and did not serve students.\\" Bircham acquired Oxford International College in 2000.  Accreditation status  BIU's website presents a list of accreditations and memberships, but none of them are from an educational accreditation body recognized by the countries where it operates. Sources explicitly listing Bircham as \\"unaccredited\\" include the Maine Department of Education and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which state that Bircham has \\"No degree-granting authority from Spain (American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers [AACRAO] evaluation).\\" The Oregon Office of Degree Authorization considers BIU an unaccredited foreign degree supplier. BIU describes itself as a practitioner of non-formal education. While it operates legally under Spanish law, it is not formally recognized by the Ministry of Education of Spain. Because BIU is unaccredited, its degrees and credits might not be acceptable to employers or other institutions. Use of its degree titles may be illegal in some jurisdictions.  Reception  In 2003, South Florida's CityLink magazine reported that Oregon education officials said that Bircham was \\"totally bogus\\". In July 2007, the Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) of Mexico issued a notice stating that degrees lacking RVOE (Official Recognition from the Mexican Government) will not be validated by the SEP. Degrees via online or distance learning issued by foreign institutions like Bircham University will not be recognized by the SEP. In April 2008 the Nairobi Business Daily reported that Bircham International University was operating in Kenya without authorization. In March 2010 the same newspaper published a correction, stating that BIU \\"is a Spanish institution of distance learning and is in good standing with Spanish authorities that offers alternatives to formal adult higher education specifically aimed at adult working professionals\\" and that its programs \\"can be legalized and validated by the Embassy of Kenya in the USA or Spain despite the institution not being registered by the Commission for Higher Education in Kenya\\". An official of Kenya's Commission for Higher Education was quoted as warning that BIU degree certificates would not be recognized. In 2013, BIU directors state that BIU does not have any presence in Kenya nor any collaboration with other any college or educational institution in Kenya. In 2013, health fraud activist Stephen Barrett conducted a review concluding: \\"BIU offers what amounts to supervised textbook reading plus credentials that suggest bearers have considerably more formal education and expertise than they actually have. The requirements for its degrees are much less than those of universities accredited by CHEA-recognized agencies. Most of BIU's teachings are straightforward, but some promote pseudoscientific concepts and practices.

The characters started their career fighting the Fantastic Four, before confronting other Marvel heroes such as Iron Man and Spider-Man. Publication history Red Ghost and his Super-Apes were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first appeared in Fantastic Four #13 (April, 1963) and #29 (August, 1964). Fictional character biography Ivan Kragoff was born in Leningrad, in what was at the time the Soviet Union. Before becoming the Red Ghost, Ivan was a Soviet scientist bent on beating the Americans to the moon and claiming it for the Communist empire. He assembled a crew of three trained primates ‚Äî Mikhlo the gorilla, Igor the baboon, and Peotr the orangutan ‚Äî which he subjected to specialized training regimens of his design. He then took off on his lunar rocket trip on behalf of the USSR, while on the very next panel, the Fantastic Four were aiming their own rocket for the same destination. Kragoff knew enough of the Fantastic Four's history, and he purposefully designed his rocket in such a way that he and his crew would be heavily exposed to the cosmic rays that he expected would infuse them with superpowers. This was successful: Kragoff gained the ability to become as intangible and invisible as a \\"ghost\\", Mikhlo became super humanly strong and durable, Igor gained the ability to shapeshift and could transform into nearly anything, and Peotr gained the ability to attract and repulse objects. The Red Ghost and his Super-Apes, as he called them, battled the Fantastic Four soon after gaining their powers, first meeting the Thing. Red Ghost encountered Uatu the Watcher during this fight, who said he would bring the two warring groups together in a fight for supremacy over the Moon. The Red Ghost and his apes first defeated the Four and kidnapped the Invisible Girl. But he was defeated by the Fantastic Four and left on the Moon when the apes rebelled against him after the Invisible Girl deactivated a force field, allowing them access to the food the Red Ghost kept from them. Mikhlo then broke down the metal door, freeing the Invisible Girl. The Red Ghost got into the Watcher's base hoping to use his secrets, but was unable to understand the technology, and was thrown from the area by the Watcher. The Fantastic Four then used a paralyzing ray to stop him.Fantastic Four #13 With his Super-Apes, he later again battled the Fantastic Four on the moon, and again encountered the Watcher. Kragoff was accidentally teleported to Earth by the Watcher's matter transporter.Fantastic Four #29 The Red Ghost was expelled from the Communist Party and his Super-Apes were impounded. He formed an alliance with the Mole Man who was trying to use an earthquake machine to attack the surface world, and battled the Avengers, but was defeated.Avengers #12 Back with the Super- Apes again, Kragoff appeared among the villains assembled by Doctor Doom to destroy the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four Annual #3 Kragoff eventually lost his original powers. He formed an alliance with the Unicorn to steal Anthony Stark's cosmic-ray intensifier, which he used to gain the new superhuman power of a mist-like form and to give powers to his new trained apes, Alpha and Beta.Iron Man #15 He battled Iron Man and the Unicorn, but was defeated by Alpha and Beta, who turned against him.Iron Man #16 He later formed an alliance with Attuma and battled the Defenders, but was defeated.Defenders #7-8 Kragoff next experimented with a cosmic-ray intensifier to attempt to increase his own superhuman powers but instead unintentionally caused himself to be unable to leave a state of intangibility. He had his original Super-Apes kidnap Anthony Stark and forced him to build a \\"cosmitronic cannon\\" and return him to a tangible state. He battled Iron Man, but the next time Kragoff became intangible, his atoms began to disperse as a side effect of his treatment with the cannon. Kragoff's consciousness managed to force his atoms to remain together, although his body remained in an intangible and, at times, invisible state.Iron Man #82-83 Months later, Mister Fantastic went into space to expose himself to cosmic radiation to revitalize his own powers. Unknown to Richards, Kragoff, still intangible, was also aboard the spaceship. Kragoff used his invisibility to hide from Richards for days until he was able to immerse himself in cosmic radiation, restoring his powers to what they originally had been. The Red Ghost could again become tangible or intangible and visible and invisible at will. He even gained the power to make other objects in his vicinity intangible and invisible. Fully recovered, he battled Mister Fantastic, and escaped.Fantastic Four #197 With the Super-Apes, the Red Ghost attempted to steal a rare mathematical treatise from Empire State University. He battled Spider-Man, but escaped.Amazing Spider-Man #223 He attempted to cause earthquakes in Soviet cities, and battled the Soviet Super- Soldiers.Marvel Super-Hero Contest of Champions #1 He forced the Black Fox to accompany the Super-Apes on robberies. He once again battled Spider-Man, but escaped.Amazing Spider-Man #255 Alongside Klaw, Living Laser, and Venom during the Acts of Vengeance, he attempted to steal alien technology from the Watcher's home on the moon. Red Ghost used the powers he had gained from his re-exposure to attack Quasar. He was captured in this attempt.Quasar #6 With the Super-Apes, the Red Ghost attempted to steal the alien technology of the smartship Friday; he battled Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, and Power Pack, and was captured.Power Pack #61-62 The Super-Apes later show up alone, having separated themselves from the Red Ghost and started a life of crime on their own by taking over a private zoo in Salina, Kansas. They had turned the animals against the local population and captured three members of the New Warriors when they entered the complex. Instead of fighting their way out of the situation, they used their intellect and settled on a peaceful coexistence with the people of the town. Shortly after the Fantastic Four returned from a pocket dimension created by Franklin Richards, the Super-Apes had gained high levels of intelligence and were working on a virus that would take out humans, leaving simians dominant. The Red Ghost, conversely, had degenerated into a childlike mental state and spent most of the time interested in a bunny rabbit. The Red Ghost and the Super-Apes teamed up again and the Red Ghost regained his original intelligence. They attempted to build a new Communist state in the political vacuum of Niganda ‚Äî the Socialist Simian Republic of Niganda, \\"A country where a new form of Marxist-Leninist socialism can grow, based on the purity of the ape world.\\" Red Ghost later appeared as a member of Intelligencia.Fall of the Hulks: Alpha While Red Hulk was fighting the X-Men, Red Ghost managed to capture Beast and Black Panther and sent his Super Apes to assist Red Hulk only for them to attack Red Hulk. Mikhlo was killed by Red Hulk which enraged the Red Ghost.Hulk Vol. 2 #20 The Red Ghost replaced Mikhlo with Grigori, a baby gorilla that was possibly stolen from the Leningrad zoo. The Red Ghost gave Grigori super strength via scraps left behind by Department X. Red Ghost's new team was short lived as not long after creating Grigori, when the She-Hulks attacked and captured the foursome.She-Hulks #2 The Red Ghost was with the Intelligencia when they were attacked by the Sinister Six. During the battle, he and his apes were killed when Doctor Octopus used the Zero Cannon to launch them into space.Amazing Spider-Man #676 MODOK Superior was able to revive Red Ghost and his Super Apes and the other Intelligencia members where they began to formulate their plans after their predicted shatter of the superhero community.Deadpool Vol. 2 #55 During the Civil War II storyline, the Red Ghost and his Super Apes appeared working on a new science project when Steve Rogers, the original Captain America, entered the laboratory. Red Ghost sent the Super-Apes to attack Steve, who kills them one by one. Red Ghost tries to escape, losing his right arm and left leg in the process, and is killed by Steve, who confiscated his project so he could use it for his own agenda.Captain America: Steve Rogers #4 Powers and abilities The Red Ghost possesses the ability to become intangible at will. Through concentration, the Red Ghost can achieve different degrees of intangibility and can even become like a diffuse mist. He can either float while intangible or walk on air (in a manner similar to Shadowcat). He has used his power offensively by leaving an object inside a person's body or phasing out their heart. The Red Ghost can become transparent or invisible when in intangible form, to the extent that Reed Richards was unable to detect him hiding in the same spacecraft over several days with sensitive equipment. The Red Ghost can alter the tangibility of parts of his body independently of each other. Thus, he can grab an object in a hand while the rest of his body remains intangible. Since his additional exposures to cosmic rays, Red Ghost can make people and objects become intangible if they are nearby or in his field of vision. While he is intangible, his body metabolism enables him to go without eating or without breathing for extended periods of time. =Achievements= The Red Ghost is a scientific genius with advanced knowledge in fields including rocketry, engineering, communications, genetics, robotics, physics, hypnotism, and the training of simians. He is an expert in radiology with a Ph.D. in radiology. He has perfected force-field devices, devices to mentally communicate with and control other primates, a cosmitronic gun, freeze ray pistols, rocket fuel from material found in a meteorite crater, and spacecraft made of transparent ceramic plastic to be unshielded against cosmic ray storms. He has studied various forms of socialist and communist theory. Other versionsUltimate Marvel= The Ultimate Marvel version of Ivan Kragoff was introduced in Ultimate Fantastic Four #47 (Dec 2007). He is based in a laboratory in Siberia, and is first seen experimenting on a bear named Misha, with the ability to talk. He is in contact with Dr. Franklin Storm, and persuades Storm that Sue and Reed might be interested in his work. His assistant Sorba Rutskaya then destroys their plane with a beam weapon and captures them. It appears Kragoff's work is focused towards reviving a woman named Irina, whom Storm believes is dead. Sorba later stabs Kragoff, and reveals that she plans on using a beam of energy from the N-Zone to merge herself with Sue so that she can gain her powers and use them to destroy those that she believes are harming nature. As the beam is about to combine the two, Sue escapes and the beam hits Sorba and several vials of simian DNA. When the smoke clears, it is revealed that Sorba has become a gigantic, deformed, gorilla-like creature with multiple simian limbs and heads, as well as a single human head which retains her insane personality. In addition to possessing the intangibility powers of the original Red Ghost, Sorba can also create apes and monkeys from her body that are subservient to her will where each of them is capable of manifesting N-Zone superpowers. She begins to attack Sue as Reed, Johnny, Ben, and The Crimson Dynamo rush to save Sue. Sue is able to \\"overload\\" her by inserting many other samples of animal DNA.Ultimate Fantastic Four #49 =Marvel Apes/Zombies= Stuck between dimensions with the simian version of Speedball, Red Ghost finds himself allied with the simians in the Marvel Apes world fighting against the Marvel Zombies. In other mediaTelevision= * Red Ghost (alongside his Super- Apes) appeared twice in the 1960s Fantastic Four TV series, voiced by Vic Perrin. * In the Iron Man episode \\"Enemy Within, Enemy Without,\\" it is revealed the Red Ghost created MODOK out of jealousy for Alana Ulanova. * Red Ghost appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. In the episode \\"Breakout Part 1\\", he and his Super-Apes are shown as inmates of the Big House when a mass breakout occurs, allowing them to escape. In the episode \\"Ultron-5\\", Red Ghost and his Super-Apes are defeated off-screen by the Hulk and Black Panther. * Red Ghost appears in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode \\"The Defiant Hulks,\\" voiced by JB Blanc. After Red Hulk and Skaar captured Abomination while Hulk was covering for Vista Verde's vacationing Mayor Stan, Red Ghost and his Super-Apes intercepted their transport to drain the Abomination's gamma energy to make an army of Abomin- Apes. Once Hulk, She-Hulk, and A-Bomb arrived at Red Ghost's castle, the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. were able to defeat Red Ghost and his Super-Apes, who regressed back to normal. They and Abomination were later remanded to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. =Video games= * The Red Ghost appears in the Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer video game for the Xbox 360 and PS3, voiced by Dwight Schultz. The Fantastic Four fight him and his Super-Apes on a space station. He reveals to them that Galactus is coming, and that they must stay on the station if they hope to survive. In the end, the Fantastic Four escape and tell him to come with them off the station (which is self destructing), but he refuses and disappears when they leave. It is unknown if he survived.

Its estimated mass is about a third of that of the Sun, and it is the 89th closest known star to the Sun. History of observations Gliese 581 is known at least from 1886, when it was included in Eduard Sch√∂nfeld's Southern (SD)‚Äîthe fourth part of the '. The corresponding designation is BD -7 4003. Characteristics The name Gliese 581 refers to the catalog number from the 1957 survey Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars of 965 stars located within 20 parsecs of the Earth. Other names of this star include BD-07¬∞ 4003 (BD catalogue, first known publication) and HO Librae (variable star designation). It does not have an individual name such as Sirius or Procyon. The star is a red dwarf with spectral type M3V, located 20.4 light-years away from Earth. It is located about two degrees north of Beta Librae, the brightest star in the Libra constellation. Its mass is estimated to be approximately a third that of the Sun, and it is the 89th closest known star system to the Sun. An M-class dwarf star such as Gliese 581 has a much lower mass than the Sun, causing the core region of the star to fuse hydrogen at a significantly lower rate. From the apparent magnitude and distance, astronomers have estimated an effective temperature of 3200 K and a visual luminosity of 0.2% of that of the Sun. However, a red dwarf such as Gliese 581 radiates primarily in the near infrared, with peak emission at a wavelength of roughly 830 nm (estimated using Wien's displacement law, which assumes the star radiates as a black body), so such an estimate will underestimate the star's total luminosity. (For comparison, the peak emission of the Sun is roughly 530 nm, in the middle of the visible part of the spectrum.) When radiation over the entire spectrum is taken into account (not just the part that humans are able to see), something known as the bolometric correction, this star has a bolometric luminosity 1.3% of the Sun's total luminosity. A planet would need to be situated much closer to this star in order to receive a comparable amount of energy as the Earth. The region of space around a star where a planet would receive roughly the same energy as the Earth is sometimes termed the \\"Goldilocks Zone\\", or, more prosaically, the habitable zone. The extent of such a zone is not fixed and is highly specific for each planetary system. Gliese 581 is a very old star. Its slow rotation makes it very inactive, making it better suited than most red dwarfs for having habitable planets. Gliese 581 is classified as a variable star of the BY Draconis type, and has been given the variable star designation HO Librae. This is a star that exhibits variability because of the presence of star spots combined with the rotation of the star. However, the measured variability is close to the margin of error, and, if real, is most likely a long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%. Gliese 581 emits X-rays.

Franz Delitzch's gravestone in Leipzig. Franz Delitzsch (23 February 1813, in Leipzig ‚Äì 4 March 1890, in Leipzig) was a German Lutheran theologian and Hebraist. Delitzsch wrote many commentaries on books of the Bible, Jewish antiquities, Biblical psychology, as well as a history of Jewish poetry, and works of Christian apologetics. Today, Delitzsch is best known for his translation of the New Testament into Hebrew (1877), and his series of commentaries on the Old Testament published with Carl Friedrich Keil. Delitzsch's son, Friedrich Delitzsch (1850‚Äì1922), was an influential Assyriologist and author of works on Assyrian language, literature, and history. Biography Although Delitzsch was Christian, he was often supposed to be of Jewish ancestry, due to the unusual breadth of his rabbinical learning, as well as his strong sympathy with the Jewish people, whom he defended against attacks. His family circumstances were also unusual, in that he had a Jewish benefactor who lived in the family house, and a Jewish godfather. Delitzsch was baptized on March 4, 1813 at the big St. Nicholas Church in central Leipzig, with the name \\"Franz Julius\\". His father Johann Gottfried Delitzsch was a peddler, craftsman and day laborer. His mother's name was Susanna Rosina. Franz was the youngest of three children, but the only one to survive early infancy. His godfather's name was given on the baptismal record as Franz Julius Hirsch, a dealer in second-hand furniture. The fact that the godfather's given name was the same as his own is a first indication of possible filiation.S. Wagner, Franz Delitzsch, 1991, p. 9 ff. Another unusual detail has to do with his schooling. Despite his parents' humble circumstances, Delitzsch was able to attend school and university thanks to the patronage of one Lewy Hirsch, a Jewish antiques dealer whom Delitzsch called his \\"benefactor\\". Hirsch lived in the same house as the Delitzsch family. It seems that Hirsch may have later been baptized thanks to Delitzsch's influence, taking the name \\"Theodor\\".Rudolf Smend, Franz Delitzsch - Aspects of Life and Work, 2009, p. 347 f. There was speculation during Delitzsch's lifetime that Lewy Hirsch and the godfather Franz Julius Hirsch were actually the same person, and that this was in fact Delitzsch's biological father. Delitzsch himself always rejected this allegation. But the notion that Delitzsch's family harbored a secret Jewish identity under a Christian facade is not far-fetched. Conversion to Christianity was common among German Jews at the turn of the 19th century, and it was usually motivated by pragmatic considerations, since government posts and teaching positions were restricted to Christians.See Amos Elon, The Pity Of It All: a history of Jews in Germany, 1743-1933, Penguin Books, 2004, p. 81 ff. At the time of Delitzsch's baptism Germany was under French rule and had enacted Jewish emancipation, but the law still excluded Jews from government positions and teaching posts; and after the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the emancipation edict was repealed. Delitzsch specialized early on in Semitic studies. He became assistant professor at the University of Leipzig in 1844, and full professor at the University of Rostock in 1846, then the University of Erlangen in 1850, and in 1867 he came back to the University of Leipzig, where he spent the rest of his life.Crawford Howell Toy and Richard Gottheil, \\"Franz Delitzsch\\", Jewish Encyclopedia (1906), accessed 12 January 2017. Delitzsch had two sons, Johannes (1846-1876), who became a theologian, and Friedrich (1850-1922), the noted Assyriologist. Delitzsch collaborated with Carl Friedrich Keil on a commentary series which covers the whole of the Old Testament. First published in 1861, it is still in print. Delitzsch contributed the commentaries on the Book of Job, Psalms, Book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, and the Book of Isaiah. Independent of this series, Delitzsch also wrote a commentary on the book of Genesis, published in 1888.Klock and Klock published a 1978 reprint of the English translation by Sophia Taylor. Delitzsch's translation of the New Testament into Hebrew (1877) is still considered the standard New Testament edition in Hebrew and in its 10th Edition it was revised by a young Arnold Ehrlich at Delitzsch's insistence. This edition was intended to be used for proselytization among Jews. Later it was revised by Gustaf Dalman, with whom he shared \\"a common interest in the evangelization of the Jews\\".Dalman, G., \\"The Hebrew New Testament of Franz Delitzsch\\", The Old and New Testament Student, Vol. 15, No. 3/4 (Sep. - Oct., 1892), pp. 145-150, available at https://www.jstor.org/stable/3158076 It is remarkable that these editions were composed before the modern revival of the Hebrew language, but the translations still remain fresh and alive for readers today. In 1880 Delitzsch established the Institutum Judaicum in Leipzig for the training of Christian missionary workers among Jews. Another Christian missionary to the Jews, John Duncan, wrote that Delitzsch \\"stood firm in maintenance of the divine authority and inspiration of the whole Old Testament\\" at a time when many \\"seemed willing to surrender.\\"  Works  Old Testament Commentary = Keil‚ÄìDelitzsch: Commentary on the Old Testament I‚ÄìX.

The university is also known as Alliant. It offers programs in six California campuses ‚Äì in San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Irvine, Sacramento, and Fresno ‚Äì and four international campuses ‚Äì in Mexico City, Mexico; Nairobi, Kenya; Tokyo, Japan; and Hong Kong. Its enrollment is approximately 4,000 students, of whom 95% are post-graduate.  History  Alliant was formed in 2001 by the combination of two older institutions: the California School of Professional Psychology (CSPP) and United States International University (USIU). Like the institutions that it descended from, Alliant has its home campus in San Diego, California. Until 2007, USIU also had a Europe campus in a former public school in the UK, which was used as a site for many films, including the Harry Potter series. USIU is the descendant of the original Balboa School of Law founded by Leland Ghent Stanford as a private graduate institution, in 1924. The name was changed to Balboa University, and then to California Western University in 1952. Once again, in 1968, the school's name was changed to United States International University. The law school, however, retained the name of California Western School of Law. William C. Rust, was the president of California Western University who ushered in the transformation to USIU and led the school for the next 37 years. Rust's vision was \\"to create global understanding through a single university with campuses all over the world.\\". The founding goal for USIU was a focus on \\"human excellence\\" over \\"intellectual excellence.\\" By 1971, Rust had transformed the former small liberal arts school of California Western University located in Point Loma (at present day Point Loma Nazarene University) into what the San Diego Reader referred to as an \\"international phenomenon.\\" Besides the main Point Loma campus, USIU had developed a network of campuses both nationally in Maui, Steamboat Springs, and Guam as well as internationally, with branch campuses in: London, Mexico City, Tokyo and Nairobi. In 1986, Rust was still breaking new ground for buildings and maintaining a focus on further expansion in: Latin America, the Middle East, Europe and Russia. However, by 1990, after 37 years of leading the university and enduring several rocky financial episodes, Rust was removed of all governing power by the board of trustees. Gary Hays, former chancellor of the Minnesota State University, took over as president of USIU in April 1990 and reorganized the University into just two remaining colleges; arts and sciences and business administration. In 1999, the Nairobi campus became its own independent entity known as United States International University Africa. In the early 1980s, USIU held a broadcast license to operate KUSI, a startup UHF television station in San Diego. However, for unknown reasons, USIU decided not to launch the channel. The license was transferred to Texas businessman Mike McKinnon and it began as a commercial station in 1982. KUSI still exists as an independent station and assumed this status when the station dropped United Paramount Network UPN on January 16, 1998. In February 2015, Alliant became a for-profit benefit corporation and part of the Arist Education System, a subsidiary of Bertelsmann.  Schools  Alliant International University is composed of several academic schools: * California School of Professional Psychology The California School of Professional Psychology (CSPP) was founded in 1969 under the auspices of the California Psychological Association. CSPP offers programs in clinical psychology, clinical counseling, and marital and family therapy. * California School of Management & Leadership In 2011, Alliant International University renamed their management school to Alliant School of Management then to California School of Management & Leadership in 2018. Formerly the Marshall Goldsmith School of Management, named for organizational consultant and executive coach Marshall Goldsmith, the School of Management offers a 4-year BSBA program, master's and doctoral degrees in Business, Management, and Leadership. * California School of Education The California School of Education offers programs in teaching, school psychology, educational leadership, and teaching English to speakers of other languages. * California School of Forensic Studies The California School of Forensic Studies offers programs in criminology and criminal justice. * San Francisco Law School San Francisco Law School became a constituent school of Alliant International University in 2010.  Accreditation  Alliant, including all of its programs, is accredited by the WASC Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities. The university's education programs are accredited by the California State Board of Education. Clinical psychology programs are accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA). Alliant's marital and family therapy programs are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education.

It was also included on the Military Times EDGE magazine's list of Best for Vets Colleges in 2010 and 2011; in 2011, Alliant was ranked #10 on the list, making it the highest-ranked non-traditional university in California.  Athletics  The USIU Gulls Football team produced 6 professional football players. The team was once briefly coached by the legendary player and coach Sid Gillman before he took his final coaching job with the Philadelphia Eagles. In just 4 months, \\"Gillman turned the team into a west coast legend.\\" In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Al Palmiotto, USIU‚Äôs athletic director during Gillman's time, recalled that Gillman said, ‚ÄúWhat a lucky sonofabitch [sic] I am finding a place like this for the last years of my life.\\" Four of the coaches he recruited all went on to have extensive careers in the NFL: Tom Walsh, John Fox, Mike Solari and Mike Sheppard. While 2 players he recruited became NFL starters Bob Gagliano and Vernon Dean. USIU's international presence and student body allowed it to field a competitive NCAA Division I hockey team the USIU Gulls, which was the only NCAA team \\"west of the Rockies.\\" In 1980, Sports Illustrated covered the team's triumphs with a 16-8-2 record in article titled the \\"Beach Boys on Blades.\\" However, in 1990 after 10 years and producing two NHL Pittsburgh Penguins players Darren Lowe and Pat Mayer the program was dropped due to the rising costs associated with \\"traveling 2000 miles to compete.\\" USIU also maintained a NCAA Division I basketball team which has been referred to as the \\"greatest show in college basketball\\" and the \\"forgotten team of San Diego.\\" When playing for the USIU Gulls, Kevin Bradshaw, former Navy All Star's player and earlier teammate of David Robinson, recorded an NCAA record for the most points in a single game versus a NCAA Division I team by scoring 72 points in a 186-140 loss to Loyola Marymount University on January 5, 1991. Bradshaw was the first African-American coach in professional Israeli basketball history and the subject of a 2012 documentary \\"shooting from home\\". The Gulls played their final men's basketball season in 1990‚Äì91. USIU's, softball team appeared in one Women's College World Series in 1982. The Gulls defeated Ohio State 1‚Äì0 in the team's first game.

Established by an IMO Assembly Resolution in 1983, the aim of WMU is to further enhance the objectives and goals of IMO and IMO member states around the world through education, research, and capacity building. Status WMU is considered an international university and has been granted the status of a UN institution by its host country, the Government of Sweden. Serving as a center for people of many nationalities to participate in teaching and learning, WMU encourages international co-operation to address international maritime problems and coordinate international action. Programmes offered include Ph.D. and M.Sc. degrees in Maritime Affairs. Post-graduate diplomas are offered via distance education in Marine Insurance, Maritime Energy, Executive Maritime Management, and International Maritime Law. Professional Development Courses (PDCs) and international conferences and events cater to the professional maritime community, as well as research. As part of IMO, WMU is an education provider that is independent of any individual national education system, and is not a Swedish institution. WMU's PhD programme and MSc in Maritime Affairs are accredited by ZEvA (Zentrale Evaluations- und Akkreditierungsagentur Hannover/ Central Evaluation and Accreditation Agency Hanover). WMU is operated for all IMO Member States and is entitled to conduct activities in Sweden under the agreement concluded between IMO and the Government of Sweden and the provisions of the Charter of WMU adopted by IMO for WMU activities in Sweden (A 25/Res. 1030). Under the provisions of this Charter, WMU has the power to confer degrees in Sweden as confirmed in 2014 by the Ministry of Education and Research. Due to this special status, WMU is not accredited in Sweden but is internationally considered as a recognized institution, according to a United Nations statement. History In the early 1980s, the IMO recognized that there was a shortage of well-qualified, highly educated maritime experts, particularly in lesser developed nations. To address this gap, the IMO endeavored to found an institution to support Member States with the high- level education necessary to implement international Conventions. Subsequently, in 1981 it passed Resolution A. 501(XII), which requested that the Secretary-General of the United Nations take all steps in order to establish a world maritime university. In determining the institution's location, then IMO Secretary-General, Dr. C.P. Srivastava, approached the Swedish Ministry of Transport who welcomed the idea and Malm√∂ was determined as the home of the institution. With the financial support of the Swedish government, the City of Malm√∂, and private donations, WMU was inaugurated on 4 July 1983. Campus The city of Malm√∂ has always provided facilities for the University. In April 2015, WMU moved to the historic Old Harbour Master's building, Tornhuset, in the center of Malm√∂. Completed in 1910 and designed by the eminent Swedish architect Harald Boklund, Tornhuset served as the main office for Malm√∂‚Äôs harbor administration and was intended to provide panoramic views of shipping in the √ñresund and in Malm√∂ harbor. An architectural competition by the City of Malm√∂ sought the best possible design for the extension to Tornhuset. The winning entry by renowned architect Kim Utzon of Kim Utzon Architects in collaboration with Australian architect Tyrone James Cobcroft of Terroir Architects, centered on the concept of the building as an \\"urban hinge\\" linking the historic city center of Malm√∂ to the docklands. The new facilities essentially doubled the University‚Äôs floor space. Organization WMU is governed by Charter and Statutes, approved by IMO Assembly, which is made up of delegations from 170 IMO Member States and 3 Associate Members. The WMU Board of Governors (BoG) is appointed by the IMO Secretary-General, and consists of 30 members, who each serve two-year renewable terms. The Board of Governors meets annually, chaired by WMU‚Äôs Chancellor who to date has been the IMO Secretary-General. The BoG reports to IMO Council which consists of the 40 leading maritime states. An 11-person Executive Board (EB) is appointed by the IMO Secretary-General to help facilitate the work of WMU, provide oversight between sessions of the BoG, give directions and guidelines as necessary, consider draft plans of work and budgets, report to the BoG, and meet no less than three times a year. Members of the EB serve renewable two-year terms. WMU‚Äôs current Charter was established by IMO Resolution A.1030(26), which took effect on 1 January 2010. The appointment and functions of the Chancellor, the Board of Governors, the Executive Board, and the Academic Council are detailed in the Charter. Any amendment to the WMU Charter is submitted by the Board of Governors to the IMO Council for approval and thereafter to the IMO Assembly for adoption. Programmes WMU offers only postgraduate studies, meaning the students must have completed a relevant university education. In addition, students are expected to have worked in the industry for at least five years. A solid understanding of English is a requirement of all WMU programmes and students must pass internationally recognized tests of English as a foreign language. Students who need to sharpen their English skills prior to the start of the Malm√∂ M.Sc. studies can enroll in the intensive, 3- month English and Study Skills Programme (ESSP) focusing on maritime English. Programmes available as of 2020 include: =Doctoral programme= WMU offers a doctoral programme in Maritime Affairs within the following research priority areas: *Environmental Impacts of Marine Activities *Maritime and Marine Technology & Innovation *Maritime Economics & Business *Maritime Energy Management *Maritime Law, Policy & Governance *Maritime Safety *Maritime Social & Labour Governance *WMU-Sasakawa Global Ocean Institute As of 2019, 20 graduates have been awarded the doctoral degree. =Master of Science in Maritime Affairs= The following areas of specialization within the Master of Science in Maritime Affairs include: The areas of specialization in Malm√∂, Sweden include: *Maritime Safety & Environmental Administration *Ocean Sustainability, Governance and Management *Maritime Education & Training *Maritime Law & Policy *Port Management *Shipping Management & Logistics *Maritime Energy Management =Master of Science in International Transport & Logistics= Offered in Shanghai, China in cooperation with Shanghai Maritime University (Shanghai Maritime University) =Master of Science in Maritime Safety & Environmental Management= Offered in Dalian, China in cooperation with Dalian Maritime University (Dalian Maritime University) =Distance learning= WMU offers several programmes via distance learning; Executive Maritime Management postgraduate diploma in cooperation with DNV GL, International Maritime Law LLM and postgraduate diploma in co-operation with Lloyd's Maritime Academy, and postgraduate diplomas in Marine Insurance Law & Practice and Maritime Energy Management offered soley by WMU. In addition, the Maritime Welfare (MARI-WEL) Professional Development Programme was created in partnership by the ITF Seafarers‚Äô Trust and the World Maritime University. MARI-WEL is the first programme of its kind to deliver a comprehensive overview of the topics and issues that relate to seafarer welfare. Student life Henrik Smith Residence The average age of the students is generally mid-30s and each class represents roughly 50 countries. WMU actively works to implement the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 5 regarding gender equality. Until the late 1990s, female students made up less than 5% of the Malm√∂ intake. Recruitment strategies and support from fellowship donors have resulted in the proportion of female students rising to around a third of the annual intake. Roughly half of the students are funded by their own companies, governments, or national funding agencies. Financial support from WMU donors accounts for the remaining students with only a fraction of the students paying out-of-pocket. Teaching and learning WMU has an international faculty of roughly 20-25 resident members, plus research associates, from countries spanning the globe. There are also more than 100 Visiting Lecturers annually from around the world. Many of the faculty have backgrounds as mariners, and almost a quarter of WMU faculty are female. In general, courses in the M.Sc. programmes are intensive, 1-2 week long classes allowing students to focus on a particular topic, and facilitating the incorporation of visiting professors. The first term focuses on Foundation studies that are completed by all students before specialized studies take place during Terms 2 and 3. The final Term 4 focuses on a range of electives, allowing students to deepen their specialization and add explore other specializations as well. An important part of the Malm√∂ M.Sc. education is the Field Study programme that provides the opportunity for students to travel and to see what they are learning in class being put into practice. Each student in the M.Sc. Malm√∂ programme spends essentially three weeks traveling for field studies to host organizations in such countries as Canada, Chile, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Korea, Malta, Norway, Portugal, The Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Field studies are also a part of the M.Sc. programmes in Shanghai and Dalian, China, but are typically more regionally oriented. International conferences WMU organizes and hosts a range of successful international maritime conferences, often co-hosted with international organizations, including IMO, UNEP, and the EU. With keynote speakers and participants from government, industry, and academia from around the globe, these events underscore the University‚Äôs commitment to high-level discussions on important issues of the day but also its engagement to promote effective partnerships in the maritime and ocean community in support of the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Professional development courses WMU offers an extensive range of professional development courses (PDCs) in a variety of subjects with the potential for tailor-made courses at any location worldwide. WMU has a unique relationship with the IMO that allows for unprecedented access to maritime experts and a close connection to the broad spectrum of key maritime issues. PDC topics are based on the current needs and projected requirements of the maritime market particularly in key IMO mandated areas of maritime safety, security and environmental management. Led by WMU faculty, PDCs can range in length from a few days to several weeks. Research Parallel to the academic programmes, research is a priority at WMU with roughly 15 on-going projects in areas such as mitigating invasive species in the arctic, risk assessment, Maritime Spatial Planning, e-navigation and safety of life at sea. In May 2012, IMO Secretary General Koji Sekimizu inaugurated the Maritime Risk and Safety (MaRiSa) Simulation Laboratory, a specialized research lab offering unique experimental facilities, particularly in the field of e-navigation. WMU-Sasakawa Global Ocean Institute The WMU-Sasakawa Global Ocean Institute was inaugurated in May 2018. As an independent focal point for the ocean- science-policy-law-industry interface where policy makers, the scientific community, regulators, industry actors, academics, and representatives of civil society meet to discuss how best to manage and use ocean spaces and their resources for the sustainable development of present and future generations. The Institute undertakes challenge-led, interdisciplinary, evidence-based research as well as educational and capacity-building training with a particular focus on the implementation of Goal 14 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The work of the Institute is supported by The Nippon Foundation of Japan, Sweden, Germany, Canada, the European Commission and the City of Malm√∂. Institutional publications The WMU Journal of Maritime Affairs (WMU JoMA) was established in October 2002 and since 2011 has been published by Springer. It is an international journal that covers the subject areas of maritime safety, marine environment protection and shipping operations, giving special attention to the human element and the impact of technology. WMU JoMA is for professionals in maritime administration, industry and education. It aims at serving the international maritime community by presenting fresh ideas and current thinking on subjects of topical interest, reporting on relevant research findings and addressing interrelationships between safety, environment protection and efficiency of maritime transport.

The route runs out of the city centre along the following route: Michael Collins Bridge, Custom House Street, √âamon De Valera Bridge, Albert Street and Old Market Road. The bridges are across the two diverged parts of the River Lee which flow around the city centre. The South Link Road was opened to traffic in May 1985. By the mid 1990s, the road surface of the South Link Road had fallen into a state of disrepair. Between 1998 and 1999, a new road surface was laid down along the entire distance of this route. The South Link Road brings the N27 from the city centre area out to the N40 Cork South Ring Road at the Kinsale Road Roundabout, a three lane signal-controlled non-symmetrical roundabout (with 5 exits) that has been upgraded to a grade-separated interchange in relatively recent times, and referred to as the Magic Roundabout. The southern exit of this roundabout is the Kinsale Road, or Airport Road, and carries the N27 out to the airport. The section of the N27 between the Kinsale Road Roundabout and Farmer's Cross was improved during the mid to late 1990s. In 2005, this route section received further improvements. The route terminates at the Airport Road Roundabout. The western exit at this roundabout is the only main access into the airport itself.

The team he played the most games for was the Chicago White Sox, including one All-Star Game appearance. After his retirement as a player, he spent nearly 30 years as a White Sox radio broadcaster. Baseball career Farmer had limited success during the first part of his career; however, his fortunes changed dramatically following a mid-career injury. He re-invented himself while toiling for three-plus years, spent mostly in the minor leagues. This led to his best seasons, 1979 to 1981 with the Chicago White Sox, during which he recorded 54 of his 75 career saves. Farmer started only 21 games in his career; his other 349 appearances were out of the bullpen. In 370 total MLB games, his career statistics include a 30‚Äì43 record, with a 4.30 earned run average (ERA), 395 strikeouts, and 624 innings pitched. =Early career= Farmer was a 1967 graduate of St. Rita High School on the southwest side of Chicago. He was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the fifth round of the 1967 MLB draft, and played in their farm system from 1967 into the 1973 season, while making 105 major league appearances with the Indians during parts of the 1971‚Äì1973 seasons. In June 1973, Farmer was traded to the Detroit Tigers, in exchange for pitcher Tom Timmermann and infielder Kevin Collins. He made 24 appearance for Detroit through the end of the 1973 season. In March 1974, Farmer was part of a multi-team trade that sent him to the New York Yankees; they then sold his contract to the Philadelphia Phillies, before he played a game for them. Farmer later stated it was because he had refused a minor league assignment with he Yankees. He appeared in 14 games for Philadelphia through the end of the 1974 season. After the season, the Phillies traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers. During the 1975 season, Farmer was limited to 14 appearances for the Brewers' Triple-A affiliate, then was released by the team in April 1976. He did not play professionally during the 1976 season, due to surgery to remove a bone spur in his right shoulder. To this point in his career, Farmer had appeared in 143 MLB games, registering a 12‚Äì12 record, with a 5.05 ERA, 14 saves, and 139 strikeouts, in innings pitched. Farmer was with the Baltimore Orioles from March 1977 to March 1978, making just one MLB appearance for the team while otherwise pitching in Triple-A. The Brewers signed Farmer in April 1978 for his second stint with the franchise. Making just three MLB appearance for them during the 1978 season, he again mainly pitched in Triple-A. After the season, the Brewers traded Farmer and first baseman Gary Holle to the Texas Rangers in exchange for pitcher Reggie Cleveland. Farmer made 11 MLB appearances for the Rangers during the first half of the 1979 season. A notable feud started between Farmer and outfielder Al Cowens ‚Äî then with the Kansas City Royals ‚Äî early in the season. On May 8, a Farmer pitch thrown in the top of the fifth inning fractured Cowens' jaw and broke several teeth, causing him to miss 21 games. Farmer later said that Cowens had attempted to steal signs from the catcher and thought the pitch would be a breaking ball away, but it was actually an inside fastball. At the start of the same game, Farmer had also hit Royals second baseman Frank White and broke his wrist, which kept him sidelined for a month. =White Sox years= The White Sox acquired Farmer and Holle from the Rangers on June 15, 1979, in exchange for third baseman Eric Soderholm. Farmer responded by recording 14 saves for the Sox, 13 of them coming after the All- Star break. Al Cowens with the Kansas City Royals The next season, on June 20‚Äö 1980, Farmer and Cowens faced each other again; Farmer now with the White Sox and Cowens now with the Tigers. In a game at Comiskey Park, with Farmer pitching, Cowens hit a ground ball to shortstop. While Farmer watched his infielders make the play, Cowens ran to the mound rather than first base, and tackled the pitcher from behind, landing several punches before the benches cleared and the two were separated. American League president Lee MacPhail suspended Cowens for seven games, and Farmer filed a criminal complaint, resulting in a warrant being issued for Cowens in Illinois. Later, Farmer agreed to drop the charges in exchange for a handshake‚Äö and the two players brought out the lineup cards before a game in Detroit on September 1, and shook hands. A later appearance by Cowens at Comiskey Park was greeted by fans with a \\"Coward Cowens\\" banner. In 1980, Farmer was selected to play in the All-Star Game at Dodger Stadium. He face three batters, recording the final two outs of the sixth inning when he got Pete Rose to ground into a double play. Farmer compiled 18 saves prior to the break, and finished the season with career highs in saves (30) and wins (7). After spending the 1981 season with the White Sox, registering three wins and 10 saves, Farmer became a free agent in November 1981. In his three seasons with the White Sox, Farmer appeared in 148 games and notched 54 saves while striking out 144 batters in innings pitched, with a 3.31 ERA. =Late career= The Phillies signed Farmer in January 1982, for his second stint with the team. After pitching in 47 MLB games for them in 1982 and 12 games in 1983, the club released him in August 1983. Shortly thereafter, he signed with the Oakland Athletics, appearing in five games for them late in the 1983 season, his last MLB appearances. Oakland released Farmer in March 1984. He finished his career in the minor leagues with Oakland in 1984, with the unaffiliated Class A Miami Marlins of the Florida State League in 1985, and with the Pittsburgh Pirates' Triple-A team in 1986. Post-playing career Farmer was a scout in the Orioles organization between 1988 and 1990, and briefly had a White Sox front office role. In 1991, Farmer took a part-time role on White Sox radio broadcasts, then was a full-time color commentator from 1992 to 2005. He became well known among fans by the nickname \\"Farmio\\".

He threw and batted right-handed. Farrell fathered MLB pitcher Richard Dotson who played for the Chicago White Sox. Career Born in Boston, Massachusetts, he played for the NL Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Houston Colt .45s / Astros. Before the 1953 season, Farrell was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur free agent. The 19-year-old began his Minor League Baseball (MiLB) career with the class A Schenectady Blue Jays. There, over a two-year span (1953‚Äì54), he would build a Win-Loss record of 18‚Äì18, with a 3.30 ERA. He spent 1955 in the IL, with the Syracuse Chiefs, going 12‚Äì12 with a 3.94 ERA; in 1956, he played for the Miami Marlins, going 12‚Äì6 with a 2.50 ERA. In September, 1956, Farrell would get a late-season look by the Phillies and would lose his only decision; but he set the groundwork for a 14-year run in the major leagues. Farrell was one of the young Phillies pitchers of the late 1950s, along with Jack Meyer and Jim Owens, dubbed the \\"Dalton Gang\\" for their fun-loving late-hour escapades.

Bearing the brunt on one occasion was the mirror in a Milwaukee bar, broken by Farrell's fist with the explanation, \\"I looked in the mirror and didn't like what I saw, so I threw a punch.\\" Phillies fans liked what they saw of the hard-throwing rookie right-hander in 1957 when he was 10‚Äì2 plus 10 saves and a 2.38 ERA in 52 appearances out of the bullpen. On September 3, 1957, Farrell was the winning pitcher for the Phils in the last of fifteen home games the Dodgers played at the Jersey City Roosevelt Stadium, 3‚Äì2 in twelve innings. After four more seasons of relief work with the Phils, Farrell was traded to the Dodgers early in 1961. Farrell was selected in the 1961 MLB expansion draft by the Houston Colt .45s. In 1962, Farrell finished with the seventh best ERA at 3.02, but with a poor 10‚Äì20 record. A starter in Houston, Farrell was used almost exclusively in relief with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. His career totals include 590 games pitched (134 starts), a won-loss record of 106‚Äì111, 83 saves, and an ERA of 3.45. He was selected to the National League All-Star team 4 times (1958, 1962, 1964 and 1965) in his career.

It was originally known as the Dead Men's Club.  Origins  Alpha Zeta Omega was founded in Philadelphia, at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, which is now called the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia. The leader and originator of this group was Ephraim G. Sless. The original members (also known as fraters) were: * Harry Althouse * Lawrence Rosenfeld * Morris Arkans * Abe M. Bernstein * David Champaine * David L. Dyen * Stanley Rosenfeld * Al Rosenfield * Louis Snyder * David Schwartz * Morris Shuman * Ephraim G. Sless * Joshua Zimskind These eleven men secretly started a pharmaceutical fraternity they dubbed the Dead Men's Club. Soon after its founding, Harry Althouse was added, and as its members then numbered twelve, the group was often referred to as \\"The Dozen\\". Later, Dr. Lawrence Rosenfeld, an eminent Philadelphia bacteriologist, also became a member, but the name of \\"The Dozen\\" persisted. Because of strenuous opposition to the formation of new organizations at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science by older fraternities and clubs, the newly formed Dead Men's Club would exist as a secret society for several years.  Purpose  Alpha Zeta Omega was formed for the purpose of academic support; the original stated goal was to ensure 100% graduation of its members. Members participated in a structured series of quizzes, designed and executed by the members most proficient in the particular subject under discussion. These frequent study sessions resulted in bringing together the social life of the members. In 1921, the Dead Men's Club boasted 100% graduation of its 13 members. In addition to the original goal of \\"100% graduation\\" the purpose of the Fraternity is now designated chiefly as \\"to spread the spirit of Fraternalism, Brotherly Love, Friendship and Good Will towards Mankind.\\"  Fraternal government  The original constitution of AZO was drawn up by A.M. Bernstein and D.L. Dyen. Stanley Rosenfeld was elected the first \\"Supreme Directorum\\" (President) of the Fraternity. The original 13 members termed themselves the Alpha chapter. The Supreme Chapter, consisting of Supreme Officer and delegates from subordinate chapters, meet regularly twice a year in January and July. At the 1925 Convention in Newark, NJ the Philadelphia Alumni chapter was chartered, which nullified the charter of the Alpha chapter. The \\"Alpha\\" fraters therefore became charter members of the Alumni chapter of Philadelphia. The fraternity is organized by chapters, each representing a specific pharmacy school or geographic area. chapters may be formed by undergraduates, alumni, and in some instances are \\"mixed\\"‚Äîcontaining both undergraduate and graduate members. The government has alternative names for their officers which follow: *Directorum - President *Sub-Directorum - Vice President *Signare - Secretary *ExCheque - Treasurer *Bellarum - Sergeant of Arms Conventions As the fraternity began to grow in its early years, it became necessary to hold a yearly convention. The first such affair took place at the Hotel Walton, Philadelphia in June 1922, with E. Fullerton Cook, Chairman of the Pharmacopoeia Revision Committee, as guest and toastmaster. At times there have been as many as 3 conventions per year. Currently, two meetings are held each year‚Äîa National Convention in July and a Regional Convention in January. Ladies' Auxiliary In 1939 a Ladies Auxiliaries was established at several chapters for the wives of AZO fraters, and at the Detroit Convention in 1940, a National Auxiliary was founded.  Publications  * The AZOan‚Äîyearly publication of AZO, started in December 1922. It was originally title \\"Hazy-O\\".

Sless Award‚ÄîAwarded to an undergraduate member for undergraduate service to AZO History Early years = After the \\"Dead Men's Club\\" graduated, the group held its first official gathering at the home of Abe M. Bernstein. It was at this time decided to change the name of the organization to \\"Alpha Zeta Omega Fraternity\\". As it was the custom at the time to use Greek letters to designate fraternities, AZO was renamed such because: * Alpha‚Äîthe first letter in the Greek alphabet, representing the beginning of time * Zeta‚Äîa mnemonic of the founders names, a symbol of the link between the creation and eternity * Omega‚Äîthe last letter of the Greek alphabet, was taken to represent the end of time. In 1922 Alpha Zeta Omega Fraternity, Supreme Chapter, was officially incorporated under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania. =Notable events= In 1937, the Ohio River Floods caused considerable damage to pharmacies owned by several members. An emergency session of the fraternity was called and a support drive was held to assist those members' businesses that were damaged or destroyed in the flood. In 1938, plans to offer insurance to the members of the Fraternity were adopted, and when finalized, $100,000 worth of insurance was written. In June 1946, AZO presented funds for the pharmacy of the Hadassah Memorial Hospital in Palestine. This was part of $15,000 pledged by AZO to build a pharmacy building at the hospital. In 1956, AZO took on as its cultural program, the task of raising money for the Hebrew University in Israel. The stated goal was to raise $100,000 in 3 years, however, the fraternity surpasses its goal and raised $103,000 in just two years. In 1961, a book titled \\"40 Years of AZO\\" was published, detailing the history of AZO. It was a 360-page, hard-cover printed volume, distributed to fraters and chapters nationwide, as well as pharmacy school libraries nationwide. Additional historical publications would follow, outlining the histor of AZO from 1960 to 1970, and then again from 1970 to 1980. In the early 1970s, AZO began admitting women as members for the first time, and thus became a co-ed fraternal organization. In 1976, the founder of AZO, Ephraim G. Sless, died. In honor of their late founder, the membership began a campaign to establish scholarships across the USA and in Israel. After the events of September 11, 2001, AZO started a project to benefit the Dean Street Heroes Fund, N.Y. Fire Dept., Engine Co. 219. After the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria to Puerto Rico, where one of AZO's chapters resides, a project was started to benefit the rebuilding of the territory.

Davis played for the New York Yankees and Minnesota Twins of the American League and the Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, and San Francisco Giants of the National League. He was selected to the American League All-Star team in 1981. Life and career Davis was born in Houston, Texas. Standing 6' 4\\", he was a hard-throwing right-handed relief pitcher. During his career he appeared in 481 games all in relief, and recorded 130 saves. Originally drafted by the Chicago Cubs, he was traded while still in the minor leagues to the New York Yankees in 1978. While in New York he was given the opportunity to become the team's closer after an injury to All-Star relief pitcher Rich Gossage. Also, while with the Yankees, he was one of the first pitchers ever to be used exclusively as a middle- inning \\"set-up\\" pitcher for his team's closer. For two seasons, 1980 and 1981, Davis and Gossage were an effective tandem, and many teams have followed this pitching formula to this day. Davis still holds the Yankee team record for most consecutive strikeouts in a single game with eight, recorded on May 4, 1981 against the California Angels. This accomplishment also gives him the team record for most strikeouts by a relief pitcher in a single game. During the 1981 baseball strike, Davis worked as a waiter at a restaurant of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kansas City. Later on, two of the hotel's overhead walkways collapsed on July 18, killing 113 people. It was reported by the media that Davis helped in the rescue efforts of this event. In April 1982, Davis was traded to the Minnesota Twins, along with Greg Gagne, and Paul Boris in exchange for Roy Smalley. Among Twins fans, with whom he came to be known as Ron \\"Boom-Boom\\" Davis, his name is still synonymous with ineffective relief pitching, despite finishing in the top five for saves in the American League in three of his five seasons with the team. In 1984, he then tied the record for blown saves in a single season with 14. No one since has blown this many saves in a single season. In 1986, his last year with the Twins, Davis began the year with two saves in April. These would be the last saves of his career. He gave up his first runs of that season in a game against the California Angels. After hitting the first batter he faced, Davis eventually loaded the bases and allowed the game tying run to score by throwing a wild pitch. In the bottom of the ninth, he then gave up a three run home run to lose the game. In another game that year against the Boston Red Sox, he came on in a save situation in the ninth inning. After getting his first two batters out, he loaded the bases and then issued a walk to force in the tying run. He then hit the next batter with a pitch to force in the winning run. With that loss, Davis lost his closer's role and was later traded to the Chicago Cubs in mid- season. He was used sparingly in relief the rest of his career. Davis pitched for the Sun City Rays of the short-lived Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1990. Personal life Ike, while playing for the New York Mets Davis's son, Ike Davis, was selected in the first round, number 18 overall, by the New York Mets in the 2008 MLB draft. When Ike was a youth, he attended a five-day baseball fundamentals camp run by his father for children ages 5‚Äì14, and Ron was Ike's little league coach until Ike was 14. He would throw at his son in batting practice in high school. In April 2010, Ike debuted in the major leagues for the Mets. Davis and his son are the 197th father-son combination to have both played in the major leagues.

Dinneen was the plate umpire for baseball's first All-Star Game. He played for the Washington Senators and Boston Braves (both of the National League), and the Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Browns of the American League. Dinneen recorded three wins for the Red Sox over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903. Dinneen broke the record for most strikeouts in a World Series game with 11; the previous mark of 10 had been set a day earlier by Pittsburgh's Deacon Phillippe. Early life Dinneen was born in Syracuse, New York, on April 5, 1876. Playing career He led the AL in losses in 1902 with 21, and led the league in saves in (2) and (4). In his remarkable season for the Red Sox, as they repeated as AL champions, he started 37 games, completing every one of them for a total of 335 innings pitched, posting a record of 23‚Äì14. On June 12, he won a 16-inning contest by a score of 2‚Äì1 over the Browns, and four of his next five starts also went at least 10 innings though he only won the first. On the season's final day, October 10, he faced the New York Highlanders in the first game of a doubleheader, with New York needing a sweep to take the pennant from Boston; the opposing pitcher, Jack Chesbro, had already established a modern record with 41 victories. The game went into the final inning tied 2‚Äì2 before a wild pitch by Chesbro gave a 3‚Äì2 victory, and the flag, to Boston. On September 27, 1905, Dinneen pitched a 2‚Äì0 no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox. Career as an umpire Dinneen joined the AL umpiring staff on September 12, 1909, just 17 days after his final pitching appearance with the Browns. He umpired in eight World Series (1911, 1914, 1916, 1920, 1924, 1926, 1929, 1932), tying the AL record set by Tommy Connolly. He served as crew chief for the 1914, 1926 and 1932 Series. He was also selected to work in the first All-Star game in 1933, calling balls and strikes for the first half of the game before giving way to the NL's Bill Klem. He was the third base umpire for the game on June 23, 1917 in which Ernie Shore replaced Babe Ruth with no one out and a runner on first base in the first inning, after Ruth was ejected for arguing the calls of plate umpire Brick Owens and then striking Owens. Shore retired the runner as well as all 26 batters he faced. Dinneen was the home plate umpire on May 18, 1912, when the Detroit Tigers staged a one-game walkout in protest of Ty Cobb's suspension; using replacement players including team coaches as well as college players in attendance, the Tigers lost 24‚Äì2 to the Philadelphia Athletics. Dinneen had his own confrontation with Ruth in the season. On June 19, the outfielder got into an argument with the umpire, and during the next day's game he again insulted the official. In response, AL president Ban Johnson on June 21 sent a letter to Ruth, reading in part: In addition to the no-hitter he pitched, Dinneen also called balls and strikes for five other no- hitters (a sixth was broken up in extra innings). He remains the only individual in major league history to both pitch a no-hitter and call one as plate umpire. For baseball's inaugural All-Star Game in 1933, Dinneen was assigned to be the home plate umpire. The umps rotated during the game, Bill Klem later taking over for Dinneen behind the plate. In 1946, Dinneen was one of 11 umpires placed on a Roll of Honor by the Baseball Hall of Fame. He threw out the first pitch before Game 2 of the 1953 World Series, the 50th anniversary of his standout World Series performance.  Later life  A lifelong Syracuse resident, he was an investor in a local brewery until 1950. He died at Syracuse Memorial Hospital at the age of 78; his death was attributed to heart disease. He was buried in St. Agnes Cemetery in Utica, New York. His wife, the former Margaret Quinn, died six years previously; he was survived by three sons and a daughter. Dinneen was mentioned along with teammates Chick Stahl and Cy Young in the 2004 revival of the song \\"Tessie\\" by Dropkick Murphys.

Durbin attended Woodlawn High School, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He was drafted by the Kansas City Royals, in the 3rd round, 79th overall, of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft. Durbin‚Äòs major league debut came in a scoreless relief appearance, for the Royals, on September 26, 1999. Professional careerDetroit Tigers= Durbin signed with the Tigers as a minor league free agent prior to the 2006 baseball season. He was a part of the 2006 International League champion Toledo Mud Hens, while also making 3 late-season appearances with the Tigers. During 2007 spring training, Durbin was in the mix for one of the final spots in the Tigers bullpen. However, starting pitcher Kenny Rogers soon went on the disabled list with a shoulder injury, and the Tigers turned to Durbin to fill his spot in the rotation. Durbin served as a starting pitcher for several stints, before ultimately joining the bullpen. Pitching in relief, Durbin served several roles, including long relief and setup. During a game on ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball against the Atlanta Braves, Durbin had a sacrifice fly for his first career RBI. He also recorded his first major league save in the same game. On December 12, 2007, Durbin was not offered a new contract by the Tigers and he became a free agent. =Philadelphia Phillies= On December 20, 2007, he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies to compete for a spot in their starting rotation. Though he lost out to Adam Eaton for a starting spot, Durbin enjoyed a strong season out of the bullpen for the eventual World Series Champions. In 2009, Durbin earned the first two postseason victories of his career, as he was the winning pitcher in Game 3 of the NLDS against the Colorado Rockies and Game 5 of the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The latter clinched a second straight trip to the World Series for the Phillies, where they'd lose to the New York Yankees in six games. Durbin spent one more season with the Phillies before rejoining the Indians as a free agent on March 1, 2011. =Washington Nationals= Durbin signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals on February 1, 2012. He was released from Nationals after Spring Training. =Atlanta Braves= He was then signed by the Atlanta Braves to a one-year contract. With the Braves, he posted an ERA of 3.10. =Second Stint with Phillies= On January 28, 2013, Durbin signed a one-year deal with the Phillies with a base salary of $1,100,000 and possible incentives totaling $350,000. The signing did not work out; the Phillies released Durbin on May 31, 2013 following a series of poor outings during which he had an ERA of 9.00. Durbin retired on November 25, 2013. Personal life Durbin lives with his wife Crystal and sons Cade and Cavan and daughter Caris in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

It reached Britain through recordings and performers who visited the country while it was a relatively new genre, soon after the end of World War I. Jazz began to be played by British musicians from the 1930s and on a widespread basis in the 1940s, often within dance bands. From the late 1940s British \\"modern jazz\\", highly influenced by American Dixieland jazz and bebop, began to emerge and was led by figures such as Kenny Ball, Chris Barber, John Keating, John Dankworth and Ronnie Scott, while Ken Colyer, George Webb and Humphrey Lyttelton emphasised New Orleans, Trad jazz. From the 1960s British jazz began to develop more individual characteristics and absorb a variety of influences, including British blues, as well as European and World music influences. A number of British musicians have gained international reputations, although this form of music has remained a minority interest within the UK itself. The early 20th century Jazz in Britain is usually said to have begun with the British tour of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919. That stated, British popular music aficionados in the 1920s generally preferred the terms \\"hot\\" or \\"straight\\" dance music to the term \\"jazz\\". Jazz in Britain also faced a similar difficulty to Brazilian jazz and French jazz, namely it tended to be seen by figures of authority as a bad influence, but in Britain the concern that jazz was from the United States appears to have been less important than in France or Brazil. Instead those who objected to it did so more because they deemed it \\"riotous\\" or unnerving. One of the earliest popular jazz dance bands was that of Fred Elizalde, who broadcast on the BBC from 1926 to 1929. By the early 1930s music journalism in Britain, notably through the Melody Maker, had created an appreciation of the importance of the leading American jazz soloists and was beginning to recognise the improvising talents of some local musicians. During the 1930s most British jazz musicians made their living in dance bands of various kinds. Jazz became more important, and more separate as its own genre. Louis Armstrong played residencies in London and Glasgow in 1932, followed in subsequent years by the Duke Ellington Orchestra and Coleman Hawkins. But local jazz culture was limited to London where: \\"jazz was played after hours in a couple of restaurants that encouraged musicians to come in and jam for drinks\\"., p. 250. The groups of Nat Gonella and Spike Hughes became notable within Britain early in the decade; Hughes was even invited to New York to arrange, compose and lead what, in effect, was Benny Carter's Orchestra of the time. Carter himself worked in London for the BBC in 1936. West Indian swing band leader Ken \\"Snakehips\\" Johnson and Leslie Thompson, a Jamaican trumpeter, influenced jazz in Britain, with the band fronted by Johnson ‚Äì \\"The Emperors of Jazz\\" ‚Äì being the first large Black band of note.Valerie Wilmer, \\"Essay: ‚ÄòBlackamoors‚Äô and the British Beat\\" , Black Musicians Conference / 1986 Standing on the Shoulders of Giants, University of Massachusetts Amherst. Johnson went on to form one of the top swing bands in the country, known as \\"The West Indian Orchestra\\", which became the resident band at fashionable London venue Caf√© de Paris, and it was here that Johnson was among those killed by a German bomb during the Blitz in the early days of the war.\\"Ken 'Snakehips' Johnson\\" at www.swingtime.co.uk. The 1940s and '50s World War II led to an increase in bands to entertain the troops and these bands began to refer to themselves as \\"jazz\\" groups more often. The period also saw an increased interest in American musicians who also toured in military bands. The future leading alto-saxophonist Art Pepper was among the visiting American musicians at this time. This all increased an interest in jazz which continued after the war. In 1948 a group of young musicians including John Dankworth and Ronnie Scott, focused on the Club Eleven in London, began a movement toward \\"modern jazz\\" or Bebop. Significant instrumentalists in this early movement were trumpeter-pianist Denis Rose, pianist Tommy Pollard, saxophonist Don Rendell, and drummers Tony Kinsey and Laurie Morgan. A movement in an opposite direction was revivalism, which became popular in the 1950s and was represented by musicians like George Webb, Humphrey Lyttelton and Ken Colyer, although Lyttelton gradually became more catholic in his approach. Trad jazz, a variant, briefly entered the pop charts later. At this point both streams tended to emulate Americans, whether it be Charlie Parker for Beboppers or Joe \\"King\\" Oliver and other New Orleans musicians for traditionalists, rather than try to create a uniquely British form of jazz. During the 1950s mass emigration into the UK, brought an influx of players from the Caribbean such as Joe Harriott and Harold McNair, though some, among them Dizzy Reece, found the shortage of genuine jazz work frustrating - dance music remained popular - and migrated to the United States. British born players too, including George Shearing, active on the London scene since before the war, and Victor Feldman also chose to move across the Atlantic to develop their careers. Several new jazz clubs were established in London in the 1950s, including the Flamingo Club.David H. Taylor, The clubs - where British modern jazz began in the 1940s... A domestic musicians' union ban on visiting American jazz musicians, initiated in the mid-thirties (Fats Waller had to visit the UK as a 'variety' act in 1938) was gradually relaxed from the mid-fifties onwards. This benefited the local scene as the often erratic availability of American records had meant that, unlike the rest of Europe, British jazz aficionados had long been unfamiliar with the most recent jazz developments in the music's country of origin. Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London, co-founded in 1959 by one of the earliest native proponents of bebop, was able to benefit from an exchange arrangement with the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), allowing regular visits from leading American players from 1961. A key musician, pianist Stan Tracey, developed his skills and gained regular employment from backing the visiting musicians. In 1959, the Chris Barber Jazz Band scored a hit with a version of Sidney Bechet's \\"Petite Fleur\\" on both the US Billboard and UK singles charts (No. 5 and No. 3, respectively). The 1960s and '70s In the 1960s and 1970s British jazz began to have more varied influences, from Africa and the Caribbean. The influx of musicians from the Caribbean brought to the UK shores excellent musicians, including the Jamaican saxophonist Joe Harriott. Firmly established as an outstanding bebop soloist before his arrival in the UK he went on to claim a leading spot in British jazz.See generally Coleridge Goode and Roger Cotterrell, Bass Lines 2nd edn.(London: Northway, 2014); Alan Robertson, Joe Harriott 2nd edn (London: Northway, 2011). Harriott was an important voice and innovator whose constant search for new ways to express his music was to lead to collaborations with fellow Jamaican Alpha Boys School alumnus trumpeter Dizzy Reece and St Vincent trumpeter Shake Keane. Harriott turned to what he termed \\"abstract\\" or \\"free form\\" music. He had been toying with some loose free form ideas since the mid-1950s, but finally settled upon his conception in 1959, after a protracted spell in hospital with tuberculosis gave him time to think things over. At first he struggled to recruit other like-minded musicians to his vision. Indeed, two of his core band members, Harry South and Hank Shaw, left when these ideas surfaced. He finally settled on a line-up of Keane (trumpet, flugelhorn), Pat Smythe (piano), Coleridge Goode (bass) and Phil Seamen (drums). Les Condon temporarily replaced Keane on trumpet in 1961, while Seamen left permanently the same year, his place taken by the return of the quintet's previous drummer, Bobby Orr. Harriot's subsequent groundbreaking album Free Form was released in early 1960, historically prior to celebrated American saxophonist Ornette Coleman's own experimental Free Jazz album. Harriott's free form music is often compared to Ornette Coleman's roughly contemporary breakthrough in the US, but even cursory listening reveals deep divisions between their conceptions of \\"free jazz\\". Indeed, there were several distinctive models of early free jazz, from Cecil Taylor to Sun Ra. Harriott's was another of these. His method demanded more complete group improvisation than displayed in Coleman's music, and often featured no particular soloist. Instead of the steady pulse of Ornette's drummer and bass player, Harriott's model demanded constant dialogue between musicians which created an ever- shifting soundscape. Tempo, key and meter always free to alter in this music, and often did so. The presence of Bill Evans-inspired pianist Pat Smythe also gave the band a completely different texture to Coleman's, which by then had dispensed with the need for a pianist. Harriott was always keen to communicate his ideas, be it on stage, in interviews or album liner notes. In 1962, he wrote in the liner notes for his Abstract album, \\"of the various components comprising jazz today - constant time signatures, a steady four-four tempo, themes and predictable harmonic variations, fixed division of the chorus by bar lines and so on, we aim to retain at least one in each piece. But we may well, if the mood seems to us to demand it, dispense with all the others\\". He recorded three albums in this vein: Free Form (Jazzland 1960), Abstract (Columbia (UK) 1962) and Movement (Columbia (UK) 1963). Abstract received a five-star review from Harvey Pekar in Down Beat, the first such honour for a British jazz record. Free Form and Abstract together formed a pair of cohesive, trailblazing free jazz sessions. The next album, Movement, featured some of his most fiercely abstract compositions, but these were tempered by some other, more straight ahead pieces. In 1962, Kenny Ball and His Jazzmen got US hit \\"Midnight in Moscow\\". One important aspect was the South African jazz musicians who had left their home nation, including Chris McGregor, Dudu Pukwana, Mongezi Feza, Johnny Dyani, Harry Miller and later Julian Bahula. There was also a growth in free jazz inspired by European models more than from American music. It helped to influence the development of a strong European identity in this field. South African and free jazz influences came together in projects like the Brotherhood of Breath big band, led by McGregor.https://www.discogs.com/artist/202310-Chris-McGregors-Brotherhood-Of- Breath Added to this, more musicians had been raised on rhythm and blues or English forms of rock and roll, which became increasingly significant to the genre. These influences mixed in a way that led to British contemporary jazz of the time developing a distinctive identity distancing it to some extent from American styles. Highly original jazz composers such as Mike Westbrook, Graham Collier, Michael Garrick and Mike Gibbs began to make major contributions during the period and after. The local scene was not unaffected by, what elsewhere came to be known as, the British Invasion; the jazz audience was in numerical decline at this time. One branch of this development was the creation of various British jazz fusion bands like Soft Machine, Nucleus, Colosseum, If, Henry Cow, Centipede, National Health, Ginger Baker's Air Force, to name a few. Some of the most significant musicians to emerge during this period include John McLaughlin and Dave Holland (both of whom joined Miles Davis's group), pianists Keith Tippett and John Taylor, saxophonists Evan Parker, Mike Osborne, John Surman and Alan Skidmore, and the Canadian-born trumpeter Kenny Wheeler who had settled in Britain. The Jazz Centre Society was founded in 1969 to develop a national centre for jazz in London and efforts to secure and fund premises for the centre continued until 1984; the JCS's many jazz promoting activities in London, Manchester, the Midlands and elsewhere survive as Jazz Services Ltd. Similar promotional organisations such as Platform Jazz in Scotland were formed in the 1970s to widen opportunities to hear and play jazz. The music continued to be presented in a wide range of venues in major British cities, but with most activity still focused in London. A National Jazz Archive was set up with its base at Loughton Library in Essex. Today it is the main location for jazz documentation in Britain, with rapidly expanding collections. John Keating's wife Thelma Keating recorded John Barry's song \\"Follow Me\\" in 1972. 1980s to the present The 1980s saw a continuing development of distinctive styles.Cotterrell, Roger. ‚ÄòJazz in Britain: Some Impressions of the State of the Art‚Äô Jazz Forum 76 (March 1982), 22-24. There was a new generation of Black British musicians who helped to re-energise the UK jazz scene, with Courtney Pine, Ronny Jordan, Gary Crosby, Julian Joseph, Cleveland Watkiss, Steve Williamson, Orphy Robinson, and later Denys Baptiste, Soweto Kinch and Jason Yarde being noteworthy examples (many of these musicians have recorded albums on historical labels such as Verve, Blue Note and are musicians who are highly regarded on the international scene. They were also members of the ground-breaking Black British big band Jazz Warriors). Loose Tubes was also very important group in re-energising the British scene. Many musicians from this band, including Django Bates, Iain Ballamy and Julian Arg√ºelles, have also become important artists with highly developed individual musical voices. Early 1990s, acid jazz group such as Incognito and Brand New Heavies were popular. The expansion of jazz was also marked by the launch of Jazz FM in 1990 and the opening of The Jazz Caf√©, based in Camden Town, London. Both of these gradually ceased to concern themselves primarily with jazz and the radio station was renamed Smooth FM in 2005. A new national digital jazz radio station The Jazz began operations at Christmas 2006, dedicated to broadcasting jazz in most styles, but was closed by its parent company in February 2008. However, new venues continue to open. In recent years funk and hip hop have become an influence on parts of Britain's jazz scene. At the same time, Black British traditions in jazz have been strengthened, in part, by the \\"rediscovery\\" and celebration in the 2000s of Jamaican altoist Joe Harriott's once-neglected music and by the publication of books about him and his close collaborator, bassist Coleridge Goode. The effect has been to make Harriott, posthumously, a powerful symbol of Black British jazz achievement and identity. A new generation of Electro-Jazz artists such as K.T. Reeder have sought to redefine Jazz through using advanced computer software and acoustic instruments. There are more opportunities now for students to specialise in jazz whether at basic learner level or at major conservatoires around the country, such as the Royal Academy of Music, Guildhall School of Music, Trinity College of Music and Middlesex University in London, Birmingham Conservatoire and Leeds College of Music. Jazz music education and artist development is also undertaken by the organisation Tomorrow's Warriors, founded in 1991 by Janine Irons and Gary Crosby, with alumni going on to win several awards.Piotr Orlov, \\"Jazz's New British Invasion\\", Rolling Stone, 2 March 2018.\\"Tomorrow's Warriors ‚Äì WINNER: Parliamentary Award for Jazz Education 2017\\".

The Interchange, which was designed in 1962, was hailed as a showpiece of European design and was opened on 14 January 1973. It is served by the majority of bus services in the city centre along with National Express Coaches, while the railway station, which is one of two in the city centre (along with ), is served by Northern and is also the terminus for Grand Central services from London King's Cross. Layout and facilities The bus station concourse at Bradford Interchange The car park and entrance The main entrance with the taxi rank and car park is on a lower level, while the train platforms and bus/coach stops are on a split upper level, both separate with pedestrian access. Downstairs, in the central concourse, there are a few shops, a newsagent, a cafe and sandwich shop and a fast food outlet on the train platforms, where hot drinks are also available. Toilets are located off the main concourse. There is also a British Transport Police office and lost luggage desk, provided for passengers' concern and safety at the railway station, with a separate security and lost-luggage unit for bus travellers, on the bus concourse. A smoking ban is observed in all parts of Bradford interchange, and CCTV is also in operation with security officers and police regularly patrolling the station. The railway station has four platforms and a short bay that was previously used for the Red Star parcels facility. Platform 1 has a run-round facility for locomotive-hauled trains (mainly freight services). The track layout and associated signalling was remodelled during the course of a week-long engineering blockade from 25 October to 3 November 2008, to permit higher speeds on both routes into the station, and also allow trains to approach the station from both Leeds and Halifax simultaneously (something that was not possible with the old track configuration).\\"Upgrade for Bradford Interchange\\"Railnews article 25 September 2008; Retrieved 19 November 2016 =Ticket offices= Bradford Interchange has separate bus and train ticket outlets.

The original railway station, named Bradford Exchange, was opened by the joint efforts of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the Great Northern Railway on 9 May 1850. In 1867, the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway, which had previously used Bradford Adolphus Street, built a link to the tracks into Exchange station to join the two existing companies; Adolphus Street station was then closed to passenger use. The railway station was completely rebuilt on the same site in 1880 with ten bay platforms and two arched roofs. Constructed of wrought iron, these rested at the outer sides on plain stone walls and classical corinthian style columns down the middle. Glass covered the middle half and timber (inside)/ slate (outside) covered the outer quarters of each span. The four end screens were glazed in a fan pattern with decorative timber outer edging. The dimensions were a length of , a width of for each arch and a height of , track to apex. The railway station never had a formal frontage; instead, passengers entered by an opening in the northwest side. In its 1920s heyday, it served routes to via Ardsley (used by many of the city's through trains to London King's Cross), via and Ossett, & Halifax via Queensbury, via Cleckheaton (the Spen Valley Line) and to Leeds via the Pudsey Loop in addition to the current lines. These however had all closed by the end of 1966 - most having fallen victim to the Beeching Axe. By 1973, the railway station with its 10 platforms was deemed too large and was again rebuilt, this time on a different site slightly further south. The old Exchange station was demolished soon afterwards and was used for a time as a car park; the site now houses Bradford Crown Court and is due to be developed as a 'Justice Quarter' with new Magistrates' and Coroner's Courts. In 1977, a bus station was built alongside, and, in 1983, the station was renamed Bradford Interchange to link buses and trains in a covered environment. The bus station featured a large ridge and furrow design of overall roof, which was subsequently demolished in 1999 to allow for a rebuilding of the bus station, which was opened in 2001. This was paid for partly by the sale of some adjacent land to the south of the site and some now-surplus land on the old bus station site. During the 1970s and 1980s, the station was considered the mainline station for Bradford with express services to London King's Cross, Trans-Pennine services to Liverpool and Newcastle and summer Saturday services to the South-West. The Inter-city services were moved to Forster Square station in 1992 when the line was electrified. The station also had an adjacent Red Star Parcels terminus but, like most other mainline stations following the privatisation of British Rail, it lost this facility during the 1990s. ServicesBus and coach= The bus station is managed by Metro. The main operators at the bus station include First West Yorkshire, Arriva Yorkshire and Yorkshire Tiger with other services run by Keighley Bus Company and TLC Travel. National Express Coaches run nationwide from the station, Bharat Coaches run coach services to Derby, Leicester, Slough and Southall and Megabus runs services to Burnley, Halifax, Huddersfield, Skipton and East Midlands Parkway railway station (with train connections to London St Pancras) as part of its Megabusplus service. Local bus services run to many destinations, including Dewsbury, Halifax, Harrogate, Huddersfield, Ilkley, Keighley, Leeds, Otley and Wakefield, as well as services within the Bradford area, such as Shipley. =Rail= Bradford Interchange is on the Caldervale Line and is one of the two railway stations serving the city of Bradford. The other station is Forster Square, a 10 minutes walk away. Monday to Saturday during the daytime, services run every 15 minutes between the Interchange and Leeds and hourly onwards to both York and Hull (the latter introduced at the winter 2019 timetable change. On evenings and Sundays, there are usually three services to Leeds each hour with one extended to both York and Hull (though the latter doesn't run on Sundays). In the other direction, there is a train roughly every 15 minutes to Halifax, with two trains an hour continuing to Manchester Victoria (one limited stop, the other serving all stations to Todmorden, then Rochdale only), one to and via and one to Huddersfield (plus one that terminates at Halifax). Since the summer 2019 timetable update, there is now an hourly direct service to and . Sundays, there are three services each hour to Halifax - these continuing to one of Manchester Victoria, Blackpool North via Preston or Huddersfield (hourly to each). Because of the geography of Bradford, the station was built as a terminus, with the lines in a 'Y'-formation, so trains must reverse out of the station to continue their journey. London services The station now also sees regular services to London King's Cross via Low Moor, Halifax, Brighouse, Mirfield, Wakefield, Pontefract and Doncaster.

The bus station was completely rebuilt in 2001. Metro are currently considering improvements to the bus and rail platforms, including better access between facilities and pedestrian access between the bus concourse and the rail platforms, to save walking down and up the escalators. The information displays were replaced in early 2009, following a modest facelift in autumn 2008, which included new signage and a repaint. In January 2010, automatic ticket barriers were installed by Northern Rail.

Martinsville is located in northeastern Bridgewater near Warren Township; the 08836 ZIP code also takes in the southern extension of Bernards Township. It is an affluent, predominantly residential area, though it does have its own commercial center along Washington Valley Road, and its own post office. History The Middlebrook encampment was a seasonal encampment of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War near Martinsville that straddled the ridge of the First Watchung Mountains. Its position provided a natural fortress not only protecting the Continental Army, but also overlooking the plains towards New Brunswick where the British forces were stationed in 1777. Tradition holds that it was at the Middlebrook encampment that the first official flag of the United States was unfurled, after a law to adopt a national flag had been passed by Congress on June 14, 1777. By special order of Congress, a Thirteen Star Flag is flown 24 hours a day at the Washington Camp Ground, part of the former Middlebrook encampment, in Bridgewater. Since 1889, the first hoisting of the flag is commemorated annually each July 4 with a changing of the flag, a reading of the United States Declaration of Independence, and the delivery of an historical address. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, Martinsville had a total area of 12.398 square miles (32.111 km2), including 12.322 square miles (31.914 km2) of land and 0.076 square miles (0.198 km2) of water (0.62%).

RCC is widely referenced as one of the best all-boys high school in Mauritius. The school has high admissions standards, and is known for producing a high number of ‚Äòlaureates‚Äô (high-performing students at A-Levels who are awarded a scholarship for foreign tertiary studies). History The Royal College Curepipe is one of the oldest educational institutions of the Republic of Mauritius. The history of the Royal College Curepipe stretches back to 1791 when the predecessor of the Royal College of Curepipe, the Coll√®ge National also known as the Coll√®ge Colonial was founded in Port Louis. It was reserved for the children of the privileged classes of that area, and the college was known as √âcole Centrale in 1800, before taking that of Lyc√©e Colonial from 1803 to 1810 during the final years of the French rule in Mauritius. The Lyc√©e Colonial was a boarding school and military training was introduced. For six months after the British conquest in 1810, the Lyc√©e Colonial was used as a military hospital in Port Louis. In 1813 the name of the college was changed by a decree of Governor Sir Robert Farquhar, and became the Royal College. The main driver for relocating the college from Port-Louis to Curepipe was the deadly epidemic of 1899 which was most prevalent in the warmer and humid capital city. In 1912 the foundation stone of the present building in Curepipe was finally laid by Director of Public Works (Paul Le Juge de Segrais). The design was inspired by the Buckingham Palace of London. The present building was inaugurated in 1914.

Background On 10 April 1919, the First D√°il announced a policy of ostracism of Royal Irish Constabulary men. At the time Sinn F√©in official policy was against acts of violence. Boycotting, persuasion and mild intimidation succeeded against many officers. However others escalated their activities against republicans and in March 1920 Collins asked Dick McKee to select a small group to form an assassination unit.Michael Collins: A Life;James A. Mackay Chpt 8  Members  Liam Tobin at the funeral of Michael Collins in 1922 When this squad was formed, it came directly under the control of the Director of Intelligence or his deputy and under no other authority. The Squad was commanded by Mick McDonnell.Bureau of Military History 1913-1921 Statement By Witness Document No. W.S. 423 The original 'Twelve Apostles' were Mick McDonnell, Tom Keogh, Jimmy Slattery, Paddy Daly, Joe Leonard, Ben Barrett, Vincent Byrne, Sean Doyle, Paddy Griffin, Eddie Byrne, Mick Reilly and Jimmy Conroy. After some time the Squad was strengthened by the following members: Ben Byrne, Frank Bolster, Mick Keogh, Mick Kennedy, Bill Stapleton and Sam Robinson. Owen Cullen (member of 2nd Battalion) was driver for a short time, and Paddy Kelly of Co Clare for a short time. They were employed full- time and received a weekly wage.Mackay, James. Michael Collins: A Life, p. 132 Sometimes the squad was strengthened by members of the Intelligence staff, the Active Service Unit, munition workers and members of the Dublin Brigade, as occasion demanded; Tipperary Flying Column men, Dan Breen, S√©umas Robinson, Se√°n Treacy and Se√°n Hogan; also Mick Brennan and Michael Prendergast Co Clare. The IRA Intelligence Staff consisted of Director of Intelligence Michael Collins, Deputy Director of Intelligence Liam Tobin, 2nd Deputy Director of Intelligence Tom Cullen, 3rd Director of Intelligence Frank Thornton, Members: Joe Dolan, Frank Saurin, Ned Kelleher, Joe Guilfoyle, Paddy Cadwell, Paddy Kennedy, Charlie Dalton, Dan McDonnell and Charlie Byrne. The Munitions included Mat Furlong, Sean Sullivan, Gay McGrath, Martin Kelly, Tom Younge and Chris Reilly. Further members included Mick Love, Gearoid O'Sullivan, Patrick Caldwell, Charlie Dalton, Mick O'Reilly, Vincent Byrne, Sean Healy, James Ronan, Tom Keogh, Tom Cullen, Paddy Lawson, John Dunne and Johnny Wilson, James Heery. Se√°n Lemass and Stephen Behan (the father of Irish writers Brendan and Dominic Behan) have also been put forward as members of the Apostles. There is no hard evidence to support many of these names; however, those that subsequently served in the Irish Army have their active service recorded in their service records held in the Military Archives Department in Cathal Brugha Barracks, Rathmines. Andy Cooney is also reported to have been associated with \\"The Squad\\". Stephen Behan's involvement in the squad was first made public in 1962 when the BBC broadcast an episode of This Is Your Life dedicated to Behan; during this broadcast other remaining members of the squad joined Behan on the set of the show.  Assassinations  On 30 July 1919, the first assassination authorised by Michael Collins was carried out when Detective Sergeant \\"the Dog\\" Smith was shot near Drumcondra, Dublin. The Squad would continue targeting plainclothes police, members of the G Division of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, and--occasionally--problematic civil servants. Organisationally it operated as a subsection of Collins' Intelligence Headquarters. Two of the executions by The Squad were the killing on 21 January 1920 of RIC Inspector William Redmond of the DMP \\"G\\" Division and on 2 March 1920 a British double agent John Charles Byrnes.http://www.cairogang.com/other-people/british/castle- intelligence/thomson/byrnes/charles-byrnes.html Bloody Sunday One of the Apostles' particular targets was the Cairo Gang, a deep-cover British intelligence group, so called since it had either been largely assembled from intelligence officers serving in Cairo or from the Dublin restaurant called The Cairo, which the gang frequented. Sir Henry Wilson brought in the Cairo Gang in the middle of 1920, explicitly to deal with Michael Collins and his organization. Given carte blanche in its operations by Wilson, the Cairo Gang adopted the strategy of assassinating members of Sinn F√©in unconnected with the military struggle, assuming that this would cause the IRA to respond and bring its leaders into the open. The most well-known operation executed by the Apostles occurred on Bloody Sunday, November 21, 1920, when British MI5 officers, linked to the Cairo Gang and significantly involved in spying, were shot at various locations in Dublin (14 were killed, six were wounded). In addition to the \\"Twelve Apostles\\", a larger number of IRA personnel were involved in this operation. The only IRA man captured during the operation was Frank Teeling. In response to the killings, the Black and Tans retaliated by shooting up a Gaelic football match between Dublin and Tipperary at Croke Park, the proceeds from which were for the Irish Republican Prisoners Fund, killing fourteen civilians including one of the players, Michael Hogan, and wounding sixty-eight. The Hogan stand at Croke Park is named after him. The elimination of the Cairo Gang was seen in Dublin as an intelligence victory, but Lloyd George commented dismissively that his men \\"... got what they deserved, beaten by counter-jumpers...\\". Winston Churchill added that they were \\".. careless fellows ... who ought to have taken precautions\\".Dolan A. KILLING AND BLOODY SUNDAY The Historical Journal, 49, 3 (CUP 2006) p.794. A \\"counter-jumper\\" was a fast-moving bank robber. Some Squad members were hanged in 1921 for the killings on Bloody Sunday, including Thomas Whelan and Patrick Moran. Moran had killed a vet, Patrick MacCormack, who seems to have been an innocent victim. Dublin Guard In May 1921, after the IRA's Dublin Brigade took heavy casualties during the burning of the Custom House, the Squad and the Brigade's \\"Active Service Unit\\" were amalgamated into the Dublin Guard, under Paddy Daly. Under the influence of Daly and Michael Collins, most of the Guard took the Free State side and joined the National Army in the Irish Civil War of 1922-23. During this conflict some of them were attached to the Criminal Investigation Department and were accused of multiple assassination of Anti-Treaty fighters. They were also involved in several atrocities against Republican prisoners, particularly after the death of Michael Collins, due to many of them having personal ties with him. Later years Bill Stapleton went on to become a director in Bord na Mona, Charles Dalton and Frank Saurin became directors in the Irish Sweepstakes. Dalton was the subject of a Kevin Myers article, Myers questioned Dalton living in Morehampton Road in 1940, but did not research his article enough to mention that Dalton was a director in the Sweepstakes at the time. In October 1923, Commandant James Conroy was implicated in the murder of two Jewish men, Bernard Goldberg and Emmanuel 'Ernest' Kah[a]n. He avoided arrest by fleeing to Mexico, returning later to join the Blueshirts. A later application for an army pension was rejected.

Reynolds Razorback Stadium is an American football stadium in Fayetteville, Arkansas and serves as the home field of the University of Arkansas Razorbacks football team since its opening in 1938. The stadium was formerly known as Razorback Stadium since 1941 before being renamed in 2001 in honor of Donald W. Reynolds, an American businessman and philanthropist. The playing field in the stadium is named the Frank Broyles Field, honoring former Arkansas head football coach and athletic director Frank Broyles. During the 2000-2001 renovations, Razorback Stadium increased the seating capacity from 50,019 to 72,000, with an option to expand capacity to 76,000 with the \\"temporary\\" bleacher seating atop the south end. History Before 1938, the Razorbacks played in a 300-seat stadium built in 1901 on land on top of \\"The Hill\\", which is now occupied by Mullins Library and the Fine Arts Center (in the \\"center\\" of campus). The new stadium cost approximately $492,000 and was funded by the Works Progress Administration, with the University of Arkansas only paying 22% of the contract. The stadium opened for the 1938 football season as University Stadium, holding a capacity of 13,500 spectators. In the home opener for the Razorbacks, the Razorbacks defeated Oklahoma A&M; by a score of 27‚Äì7 on September 24, 1938. The following week, Arkansas dedicated the stadium to then sitting Arkansas Governor Carl E. Bailey on October 3, 1938, changing the name of the stadium to Bailey Stadium. Following Governor Bailey's defeat in the 1940 gubernatorial election to Homer Martin Adkins, the stadium's name was changed in 1941 to Razorback Stadium. =Renovation= The \\"PigScreen\\", a LED display that was installed in 2000. Athletic director Frank Broyles began searching for architects for the proposed $65 million stadium expansion and renovation in 1998, believing that the renovation was needed in order for the Razorbacks to compete in the Southeastern Conference at a consistent level. Broyles hoped for a completion date of 2000 or 2001 and narrowed the search down to three architecture firms: Eisenman Architects of New York, Heery International of Atlanta and Rosser International of Atlanta. Broyles awarded the renovation contract to Heery International with local support from the Wittenberg, DeLoney and Davidson architecture firm of Fayetteville. The renovation was partly funded by the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, when the foundation donated $21 million in 1999 to help renovate the stadium. What was then the largest LED display in a sports venue, the screen produced by SmartVision was installed along with a new scoreboard at the northern end zone in 2000. The expansion was completed before the beginning of the 2001 football season, increasing the permanent seating capacity to 72,000 from its previous capacity of 51,000 seats. 4,000 bleacher seats were added in the south end zone upper deck bringing capacity to just over 76,000 with the new expansion. In honor of the Reynolds Foundation's generosity, the stadium was formally renamed Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium on September 8, 2001, where Arkansas lost to Tennessee by a score of 13‚Äì3. On November 3, 2007, the date of the last Fayetteville home game of the 2007 football season, the playing field was dedicated and named in honor of outgoing athletic director Broyles. A major renovation to the stadium was proposed in 2011 by Athletic Director Jeff Long, unveiling the plans to enclose the north end zone. The proposed renovation is estimated at $78 million to $95 million, which would feature at least 5,000 new seats, including field-level suites and indoor and outdoor club areas. A new upgrade to the stadium for the 2012 season increased the size to , from the previous LED screen size of . The upgrade was contracted through LSI Industries. During the 2016‚Äì17 offseason, the Broyles Athletic Center was demolished as part of a $160 million renovation and expansion of the stadium by CDI Contractors and AECOM Hunt. The expansion added 4,800 seats and new premium seating to the north end zone. This expansion boosted the capacity of the stadium from 76,000 (with south end zone top bleachers) to 80,800. However, since bleachers are no longer being used on the roof of the south end zone, official capacity beginning with the 2018 season, as relayed to the university's board of trustees prior to its vote to approve the expansion project, was 76,212. The increase in capacity is fewer than 4,800 seats because some club seating on the east side was eliminated to add additional suites. On August 5th, 2019, the University of Arkansas installed natural grass onto the playing surface, replacing the turf installed under Coach Bobby Petrino in 2009. Controversy Since 1948, home games were divided between two venues: Razorback Stadium and War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock. Because of the stadium renovations in 1999-2000, Razorbacks athletic director Frank Broyles wanted to move all home games to Razorback Stadium to help pay off the $30 million bond. Broyles pointed out that the expanded Razorback Stadium would increase revenue to $3 million per game, compared to the $2 million per game for playing at War Memorial Stadium. However, Little Rock investors did not like the idea of moving all home games to Fayetteville and countered with an offer to renovate and expand War Memorial Stadium to increase revenue. Also, Little Rock investor Warren Stephens threatened to discontinue his family's support ($150,000 in annual donations with an additional $1 million in annual support from his family's company Stephens Inc.) for the program if games were pulled from Little Rock. After listening to both Chuck Neinas (Broyles' consultant on the issue) and Stephens in January 2000, the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees voted 9-1 to sign a compromised contract with the owners of War Memorial Stadium. The contract would keep at least two Razorbacks games, with one being a conference game, in Little Rock until the end of the 2014 season. In 2008, the contract with War Memorial Stadium was extended through the 2016 football season by athletic director Jeff Long. In 2014, a five-year contract called for one game to be played at War Memorial Stadium each season through 2018. In 2014 and 2018, the game was a conference opponent. In 2015, 2016, and 2017 the game was a non-conference team. 2018 marked the 70th anniversary of the Razorbacks playing in War Memorial Stadium. In 2018, another agreement was signed to play games in War Memorial Stadium through 2024. The new contract specifies that each home game versus the University of Missouri will be played at War Memorial through the 2023 season. In years when the Missouri game is on the road in Columbia, Missouri, the Razorbacks will play their annual Red-White Spring Game at War Memorial in April through 2024. However, there will be no official Razorbacks football games played at War Memorial Stadium in those seasons. This means the 2020 season will be the first without a game at War Memorial Stadium since its opening 72 years earlier. Other uses The movie Greater (2016). Gallery Donald W.

Knopf in New York published the first American edition in 1936, translated by Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter. Plot summary The narrative follows the course of a man's life from his schoolboy days to his adulthood. The son of a north German merchant and a \\"Southern\\" mother (Consuelo) with artistic talents, Tonio inherited qualities from both sides of his family. As a child, he experiences conflicting feelings for the bourgeois people around him. He feels both superior to them in his insights and envious of their innocent vitality. This conflict continues into Tonio's adulthood, when he becomes a famous writer living in southern Germany. \\"To be an artist,\\" he comes to believe, \\"one has to die to everyday life.\\" These issues are only partially resolved when Tonio travels north to visit his hometown. While there, Tonio is mistaken for an escaped criminal, thereby reinforcing his inner suspicion that the artist must be an outsider relative to \\"respectable\\" society. As Erich Heller ‚Äìwho knew Thomas Mann personally‚Äì observed, Tonio Kr√∂ger's theme is that of the \\"artist as an exile from reality\\" (with Goethe's Torquato Tasso (1790) and Grillparzer's Sappho (1818) for company).Erich Heller, The Disinherited Mind: Essays in Modern German Literature and Thought (Cambridge, Bowes & Bowes, 1952), p. 167. Cf. id., The Disinherited Mind (Harmondsworth, Penguin Books, 1961), p. 187. Yet it was also Erich Heller who, earlier, in his own youth, had diagnosed the main theme of Tonio Kr√∂ger to be the infatuation and entanglements of a passionate heart, destined to give shape to, intellectualize, its feelings in artistic terms.Erich Heller, Flucht aus dem zwanzigsten Jahrhundert: Eine kulturkritische Skizze (Vienna, Saturn-Verlag, 1938), p. 9. Connection to other works Tonio Kr√∂ger forms a pair with the more famous story, Death in Venice (Der Tod in Venedig). They both describe the life of an artist and express Thomas Mann's views on art. In one story the artist travels from south to north, in the other from north to south. One journey ends in a tenuous reconciliation, and the other in death. But, as T. J. Reed has pointed out, :\\"In Der Tod in Venedig, Thomas Mann returns from excursions into allegory and once more writes directly about a literary artist. But the directness is not that of Tonio Kr√∂ger. There he was expressing lyrically his immediate experience, formulating and coming to terms with what he had gone through...\\"T. J. Reed, Thomas Mann: The Uses of Tradition (2nd ed.; Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 144. Thus the importance of the work lies, chiefly, in its autobiographical character, as well as in its contribution, through the description of an amiti√© particuli√®re, to the theory of love. The novel was made into a film in 1964, directed by Rolf Thiele.  English translations  * H. T. Lowe-Porter (1936) * David Luke (1988) * Joachim Neugroschel (1998) * Jefferson S.

The show aired on NBC from January 3 to April 1, 1983, and was hosted by Peter Tomarken. Rod Roddy was the announcer, and was produced by Jay Wolpert Productions in association with Metromedia Video Productions. Game play Four contestants competed on each episode of Hit Man in a memory-based quiz game. One was either a returning champion or champion-designate, with the other three contestants competing for the right to face the champion in the second round. The surviving contestant at the end of two rounds of play played the Triple Crown bonus round for $10,000. =Round 1= Each game of Hit Man began with the three challengers, who were sitting behind desks colored blue, yellow, and green, viewing a short film narrated by Tomarken. Film topics varied widely and included biographies, the \\"making-of\\" specific films, professions, hobbies, etc. The film was also shown to the returning champion offstage, since the subject matter would later come up in the Triple Crown if he/she advanced to the round. After the film concluded, a series of tossup questions were asked to the challengers about the film they had just seen. For each correct answer the challengers gave, he or she advanced one step on a ladder displayed behind them. Answering a question incorrectly locked a contestant out of the next question. It took five answers to climb to the top of the ladder, and the first contestant to do this won $300 and clinched a spot in the second round. The remaining two contestants continued playing until one of them gave a fifth correct answer, and that contestant won $200 and ended the round. The remaining contestant was eliminated from further play and received parting gifts. =Round 2= For the second round, the champion entered the game and sat behind a red desk that was elevated. A second short film was played. After the film concluded, each contestant was given a series of \\"hit men\\". The champion was given seven hit men, the winner of the first round got four, and the second finisher was given three hit men, with each player's hit men corresponding to the color of their desk. As before, a series of tossup questions pertaining to the film were asked. The object for all three players was to eliminate the opposing hit men, with the champion trying to eliminate both challengers while avoiding losing his/her own hit men. The winner of the first round was given a choice of whether to play against the champion first or allow the runner up to play. Any correct answer knocked an opponent's hit man off the board, while any incorrect answer cost a player one of their own. If the champion lost a hit man, the challenging player kept control until either eliminating all of the champion's hit men or having one of their own hit men eliminated. Once the latter happened, control passed to the other player. If at any point a challenger ran out of hit men, that player was eliminated from further play and the game continued. If the champion managed to eliminate the challengers' hit men first, he/she retained the championship and advanced to the Triple Crown. If the champion lost all of his/her hit men, the challenger who knocked the last hit man off the board became champion. =Triple Crown= A contestant about to start the Triple Crown bonus round. The gameboard displayed eight columns with varying numbers of circles. One column held one circle; two columns held two circles; two columns held three circles; two columns held four circles; and the final column held five circles. The contestant turned his/her back to the board, and the columns were randomly re- ordered. The contestant had 60 seconds to answer questions based on either of the day's two stories. The clock started as soon as he/she chose a column, and each correct answer placed a \\"money man\\" in one of its circles. The contestant chose a new column after a pass or wrong answer, or after filling every circle in the column. If the contestant filled any three columns with money men before time expired, he/she won $10,000. If he/she either ran out of time or exhausted all eight columns, he/she won $1,000 for each one filled. The champion competed again on the next show unless beaten or played five Triple Crown rounds, whichever came first. Broadcast History Hit Man premiered as one of three new game shows on NBC's daytime schedule, along with the new Just Men! and a revival of Sale of the Century, that the network commissioned to replace the cancelled serials Texas and The Doctors. Hit Man and its lead-in program, Wheel of Fortune, were moved to the slot Texas had occupied, with Hit Man airing at 11:30 AM Eastern. Although NBC was drawing better ratings in the hour, Hit Man suffered from ratings trouble against the second half of The Price is Right on CBS and reruns of The Love Boat on ABC and the network did not renew the series beyond its original sixty-five episode commitment. The show was replaced by Dream House hosted by Bob Eubanks. Hit Man and Just Men! both ended their runs on the same day, but Sale continued for another six years, ending in 1989. Peter Tomarken later hosted Press Your Luck, which debuted in September 1983 (five months after Hit Man ended) and ran for three years on CBS. Rod Roddy reunited with Tomarken as the announcer of Press Your Luck, and later became Johnny Olson's permanent replacement in 1986 as announcer on The Price Is Right. Roddy held this position until his death in 2003. Other versions A British version of Hitman was aired on ITV in 1989 between February 21 to May 30. It was presented by Nick Owen. Portugal had a version of Hit Man called Babylon.

The series was produced by Nelvana and began airing on October 13, 2006 in Canada on the network YTV.YTV It features the voices of Sarah Gadon, Stacey DePass, Emily Hampshire, Peter Keleghan, Scott McCord, David Berni, Jeremy Harris, and Adrian Truss. HistoryFranchise= In 2001, Ruby Gloom began as a drawing on a piece of paper by illustrator Martin Hsu and was then spawned into a franchise by the American company Mighty Fine three years later. Ruby Gloom began as a stationery line, and was featured on pencil cases, backpacks, clothing, key chains, and plush toys which were sold through Doeworld, a subsidiary of Mighty Fine. Books were also made for the series, the first being Ruby Gloom's Keys to Happiness in 2004, as well as two calendars for 2004 and 2005. Ruby Gloom was depicted as a small girl with bright red hair, who wears a black dress and red and yellow striped socks. She has a pet cat named Doom Kitty, and was described as \\"The Happiest Girl in the World.\\" Ruby was originally marketed to the goth subculture, but was later adapted for kids. The product line had an interactive website where users could chat in a forum, and click around for free things such as desktop icons and screensavers. The words: \\"Ruby Gloom is happy in her own way. Even though she is frowning, to her, a frown is only a smile upside down. In fact, Ruby is so happy, she could just die\\" greeted viewers as they entered the website. Towards the end of 2004 the website changed to forum only dubbed \\"The Mansion\\" By the end of 2004 the website had been redesigned and featured an interactive mansion to explore and user submitted artwork. Ruby is shown on the roof with her cat Doom Kitty and was given a smile for the first time. By 2006 \\"The Mansion\\" forum was removed, and the website had taken on a format aimed at kids. =Television series= In early 2005, Martin Hsu sold the rights to Ruby Gloom to Canadian animation studio Nelvana. In May 2005, the series was announced on the 2005 issue of Animation Magazine. Main charactersRuby Gloom= Ruby is a young girl who can find happiness in anything. \\"Look on the bright side\\" is her mantra. There isn't a single thing in the world that gets her down or a single negative that she can't turn into a positive. Her positive attitude allows her to act as the voice of reason in the mansion when her friends lose focus on real issues. Ruby has a crush on one of her friends, Skull Boy, and nearly reveals her feelings to him in the episode \\"Sunny Daze\\", when the two of them are trapped in a cave. Her positive outlook also makes Ruby very loyal to her friends. She likes to write in her diary and knit. Voiced by Sarah Gadon. =Doom Kitty= As Ruby's pet cat, Doom Kitty has a complete free run of the mansion and is therefore usually the only one with total knowledge of what is going on in any given area of the house. This keeps her one step ahead of Ruby and the others most of the time, because whenever something strange happens in the mansion, Doom Kitty will usually have all the facts already while everyone else is still trying to figure things out. Unfortunately, since Doom Kitty can't talk, her only hope of communicating with the others is through mime with violin noises. Ruby usually has an easy time understanding her, but it doesn't always work. This shows that Doom Kitty hates it when she is trying to communicate, and her friends think that she is playing charades. She sometimes tries to warn Scaredy Bat about Boo Boo's pranks. =Iris= Like Ruby, Iris goes through life without a care in the world, but in a much different way. Where Ruby finds happiness in anything, Iris finds adventure. From safaris to fighting wild animals to even shooting herself out of a cannon, there isn't a single thing this cyclops girl won't try at least once, as long as she thinks it's fun. Unfortunately, Iris's adventuresome nature also makes her quite impulsive and she has a bad habit of jumping into a situation without considering potential consequences. This usually results in trouble she doesn't expect. However, as soon as the trouble is gone, she's off again on another adventure. Voiced by Stacey DePass. =Misery= Misery doesn't mean to be a walking disaster area. Her mishaps are usually a combination of clumsiness and extraordinary bad luck. Evidently, these traits run in her family, as Misery has had relatives who have been present at every single major disaster in recorded history. Fortunately, her friends are all kindhearted enough to take this in their stride. Misery spends most of the time in a state of detached apathy and with ever-present trails of tears running from her eyes. She does have tiny moments of happiness throughout the series, but alas they're few and far between, her bad luck rears its ugly head and strikes her down with a vengeance, usually in the form of lightning bolts. Misery has good luck on Friday the 13th. This results with her bad luck being transferred to her friends. She also keeps \\"Dust Bunnies\\" as pets, despite being allergic to them and sneezing them away. However, they always return to her. She is considered a fan favorite due to her comic relief and cute appearance. Voiced by Emily Hampshire; singing voice provided by Jeen O'Brien.https://aminoapps.com/c/cartoon/page/blog/throwback-thursday-how-i- discovered-ruby-gloom/WJpI_XuL6ZR1YXZempx14Bzj5q18KNe =Skull Boy= A man of many talents, Skull Boy is the mansion's official Jack of All Trades. From film directing to private investigating, Skull Boy can pretty much do it all. His only problem is that he can't seem to find one thing and stick to it for any serious length of time. But if Skull Boy doesn't know where he's going, it's mostly because he doesn't know where he comes from. This is referred to in many episodes when each time he finds a new skill he surmises his must come from a long line of others with that same skill, indicating he knows little to nothing about his origins. There have been several moments that confirm that Ruby has a crush on him, such as in the episode \\"Quadro-Gloomia\\" when Frank and Len get inside Ruby's head and experience her feelings for Skull Boy first hand. He does share the same feelings towards Ruby, but he is clueless about her feelings. Even though Skull Boy doesn't know where he is from, he has a family ‚Äì his friends are his family. Voiced by Scott McCord. In Skull Boy's endeavor to discover his roots, he has undergone many personae and occupations. These include: * Action Hero * Animator * Architect * Army General * Astronomer * British Drummer * British General * Chef * Detective (Skull Spade) * Documentary Filmmaker * Etiquette Expert * Explorer * Film Director (seen in the bloopers of \\"Doom With A View\\" and behind the scenes of \\"Seeing Eye To Eyes\\") * French Investigator * Head Shrink * Ice Sculpture * Inventor * Jazz Musician * Layabout * Magician * Malt Shop Entrepreneur * Mechanic * Painter * Pilot * Psychologist * Ringmaster * R.I.P's band manager * Scientist * Shakespearean Actor * Sculptor * Tailor * Train Conductor * Train Engineer =Frank and Len= Rockers by nature, these conjoined brothers live in the mansion's garage. They have their own garage band, known as R.I.P (pronounced \\"RIP\\"). Frank and Len's strength lies in performing music. Unfortunately, this seems to be all that is their strength, since they both tend to lose focus on anything that isn't their music. They can hardly focus on something if it doesn't have a beat. Frank is actually the more intelligent of the two, often getting annoyed at Len's lack of understanding. Len is the more sentimental one, who seems to have a thing for small animals and things that don't exactly matter to anyone else. Even though they seem upbeat for their music, the two of them are almost never on the same page, even though they're conjoined. Despite this fact, Frank and Len are close. For example, in the episode \\"Quadrogloomia\\", when the brothers needed a way to become unconscious, they were unable to hit each other over the head with planks. Another example of this is in the episode \\"Iris Springs Eternal\\" where Ruby, Frank, and Len were sliding down a mud slide when Frank states, \\"Len, if we don't get out of this I just want you to know that you've been the best brother a brother could have for a brother.\\" Len replies with \\"same here.\\" Also, as of the episode \\"Quadrogloomia\\", Frank and Len are the only housemates (other than Doom Kitty) who know about Ruby's crush on Skull Boy. Voiced by David Berni (as Frank) and Jeremy Harris (as Len). =Edgar, Allan, and Poe= Poe the crow, along with his brothers Edgar and Allan, live in an attached addition to the mansion. However, out of the three, Poe is the one seen most often. Edgar and Allan are rarely seen and when they are, they never speak but act as Poe's bodyguards and servants since they are taller than him. Poe meanwhile, as a man of culture and sophistication, likes to think of himself as a role model to the rest of the mansion's residents. Unfortunately, he tends to be a little too attached to his image and likes to cover up the parts of him that make him look like less than what he makes himself out to be. For example, he'd rather tell people he's performing in an actual opera than admit that he's staying home to listen to opera records. Poe's pampered nature also tends to make him overreact to things that everyone else would more or less take in stride. There is at least some evidence that Poe's cultured accent is an affectation. In episode \\"Unsung Hero\\", Poe reverts to an East End accent while speaking to Skull Boy. Skull Boy remarks that Poe's Oxford accent has vanished much to Poe's discomfort. Poe is fond of claiming to be a descendant of Edgar Allan Poe's pet budgie Paco, which is proven in the episode \\"Time Flies\\". Poe is voiced by Adrian Truss. =Scaredy Bat= Scaredy Bat is a bat with an Indian accent who is afraid of almost everything. Where Ruby finds happiness and Iris finds adventure, Scaredy finds only fear. Despite being a bat, he's afraid of flying and is also afraid of the dark. He's also afraid of his own reflection. However, he has overcome those fears after several episodes. This constant state of fear is perfect for Boo Boo, the mansion's ghost, since Scaredy is the only one who is afraid of him. The only thing he's not afraid of is a crumpet. Even if his fear sometimes gets the better of him, Scaredy is the loyal and talented drummer of Frank and Len's band, R.I.P. When he is behind the kit, Scaredy is a beat machine and forgets his fear. He also enjoys eating mosquitoes. Voiced by Peter Keleghan. =Boo Boo= The mansion's ghost, Boo Boo sees it as his job to haunt. However, it's a little difficult for him to do that when everyone thinks he's cute, and he hates being thought of as cute. In the episode \\"Doom with a View\\", (Boo Boo's first appearance in the series), he takes exception to the other characters referring to his cuteness when they first see him. When he first arrived at the mansion, Boo Boo wasn't an official ghost in that he couldn't pass through walls and only Doom Kitty, Ruby's cat, could see him. According to the leaders of the Ghost Family (two large, mobster-type ghosts who go by the names of Mr. White and Mr. White), Boo Boo couldn't become a full ghost until he had scared at least one person and Ruby's mansion was the house they'd selected for him. But since Boo Boo couldn't go through walls and Doom Kitty was the only one in the house who could see him, his job was very difficult. However, when Doom Kitty splashed milk on him to reveal his presence, Boo Boo got a slight scare out of Misery when he almost splashed milk onto a tablecloth once owned by her \\"great-great-really-great-grandmother.\\" However, it was enough of a scare for Boo Boo to become a full-fledged ghost, since he can now pass through walls and everyone can see him. After that though, his only real motivation for staying in the mansion has been to scare Scaredy Bat, as he hasn't been able to scare anyone else since, besides people from outside of Gloomsville. However, Boo Boo enjoys pranking more than he enjoys scaring, much to Mr. White's disappointment. Despite this, he and Scaredy Bat seem to be good friends (perhaps best friends). Doom Kitty hates Boo Boo, especially since she was framed in \\"Doom with a View\\", and his presence always gets her into trouble. Voiced by Barbara Mamabolo. =Mr. Buns= Mr. Buns is a stuffed rabbit that Ruby created from one of her leftover socks. The floppy, yet enigmatic Mr. Buns loves tea cozies and pretty much finds himself in the middle of almost all the action in the mansion. He also has a strange tendency to show up anywhere and do random tasks. When Misery first sees him, she calls him a stuffed sock. Later, she is convinced that he is a \\"special one of a kind friend\\". Minor charactersMr. White and Mr. White= These two large ghosts are the mentors and teachers of young Boo Boo in his learning to be a ghost. Distinguished by their glasses and high rank within \\"The Family\\", they typically act in a mafia orientated manner (even having their own pasta making skit and Italian music playing in the background), often threatening to take Boo Boo away if he does not complete enough scares or if he is pulling pranks, such as the line \\"Less Taunt. More Haunt.\\" Noticeably, the Mr. White with the hat is a higher rank than the other Mr. White, who is usually driving their mode of transport. The characters are voiced by Harvey Atkin and Ron Rubin. =Squig= A large flying worm that Iris made friends with in her travels. Although he is not often seen, he accompanies Iris on all her adventures as both her companion and sometimes her mode of transport. He is about five times as big as Iris, and is black and red with patterns down his back, and has a small set of wings at the end of his tail. According to Iris, he can fly because nobody ever told him he can't. =Venus= Another of Iris's many pets, Venus is a venus flytrap. When Venus first appeared, she was very voracious and typically acted as a pet. However, after she ate the heart that Skull Boy made in the episode \\"Science Fair or Foul\\", she became much more caring and knowledgeable, eventually becoming a successful writer and being able to speak very eloquently, as seen in the skit \\"Suspense Writing with...?\\". Venus speaks with a thick French accent, because the record Iris used to teach her was dictated by a French man. However, Skull Boy's French accent is stronger, leading her to confusion. =Mr. Mummbles= Ruby's next door neighbour, Mr. MummblesRuby Gloom Skit: \\"The Mr. Mummbles How-to Show\\" lives in a glass house with his pet, a frog named Socrates. Mr. Mummbles received his name from Poe in the episode \\"Poe-Ranoia\\", where Poe thought that he was a murderer, and since then the name has stuck. After a revelation that Mr. Mummbles designs and creates amusement park rides, he can be seen in later episodes testing these new rides. His rides are designed to make people happy, sometimes having features that tickle the passengers. Mr. Mummbles also follows the rule \\"Safety First\\", however his rides seem to bend in the opposite direction to being safe, which includes massive spirals, gaps and fire on the tracks. Mr. Mummbles is voiced by Derek McGrath. =The Skele- Tunes= A group of Jazz/scat/Cajun musicians that befriend Skull Boy (referring to him as \\"SB\\"). The band contains four skeletons. The vocalist is the jazzy Skele-T, instantly recognized by his outfit, earrings and gold tooth. The other skeletons each have a different instrument, one with an accordion, one with a tuba and one using his rib cage as a xylophone. They are shown to be \\"Jokers\\", disappearing and joking around with Skull Boy. Skele-T does most of the talking, using jazz slang and phrases, such as \\"You're straight from the fridge daddio\\" and throwing in skeleton puns like \\"You fracture me\\" instead of \\"You crack me up\\". When Skull Boy leaves to try to find his roots, Skele-T even invites him to join their band, but he refuses due to a case of homesickness. Skele-T is voiced by Michael Dunston. =Misery's cousins and ancestors= In the episode \\"I'll Be Home For Misery\\" introduces Misery's other relatives throughout the ages for their \\"once in a millennium\\" family reunion. Malady and Malaise These two sisters are Misery's cousins, who, when both are together, cause a localized ice age. Malady is the one character that is more disease-prone than her cousin, Misery. She apparently suffers from every known disease, ailment, illness, symptom and allergy almost simultaneously, and when asked about them, she runs through all the events and procedures that led to one injury, which usually lasts hours until the conclusion. Malaise suffers from narcolepsy and can often be seen lying on a couch or bed or even asleep on the floor randomly. She is accompanied by many creatures including a snake, spiders, an octopus, snails and butterflies, which usually attach themselves to the full-body veil she wears. Despite their faults, Misery loves her cousins. Mayhem ‚Äì A cavegirl that resembles Misery. It is shown that she possesses great physical strength and little intelligence. It is implied that she chased away the dinosaurs, and is very sad that they're gone. She chases Scaredy Bat throughout the episode \\"I'll Be Home For Misery\\", shouting \\"Here Birdy, Birdy, Birdy\\". She is also seen in the episode, \\"Time Flies\\". Mildew ‚Äì A Japanese geisha that resembles Misery. She speaks in respectful tones but clashes the most with Mayhem and Migraine. Unlike her relatives, Mildew has normal colored eyes and skin. She also seems to constantly clarify whenever she is joking or not, as she once said: \\"Misery, I've heard so much about you. All bad. Joke.\\" Migraine ‚Äì Arriving on the Titanic, Migraine usually has her arms back yelling \\"I'm the queen of the world\\". She also talks like a valley girl and has a Hawaiian flower in her hair. She is also seen in the episodes \\"Time Flies\\" and \\"Disaster Becomes You\\". Morose ‚Äì Truly goth, Morose has dyed green/black hair and green and black striped stockings. Very thick streaks of eyeshadow run down her face because it mixes with her tears. She is also a singer who unlike Misery, can sing while awake and performs a song with Frank & Len while playing keyboards. The boys love it until their house falls in around her. One of Morose's only happy moments in Gloomsville is when she said \\"cool... another verse?\\". Misery calls her \\"Aunt Morose\\" in the episode \\"Sunny Daze\\". Mopey ‚Äì The optimistic member of Misery's family, she has hair just like Ruby's, which Ruby compliments and Mopey says \\"Right back atcha!\\". Motley ‚Äì Misery's great great really great grandmother. Burnt in the Great Fire of London, Motley has almost no hair left and seems generally singed all over with the bit of remaining hair on fire. Unlike Misery, she prefers light in the darkness. A piece of her table cloth was the only thing salvaged from the fire, and became Misery's prized possession. Myopic, Malice and Misbegotten ‚Äì The triplets are little kids that seem pretty happy for members of the misery family. They dance and laugh around Morose leading Morose to wail \\"Children, Cheerful, Playful Children... Why?! Why?!\\" In addition to these named family members, four others are shown. A relative that resembles Misery in a French Peasant Maid's outfit, who plays drums while Morose sings and plays her keyboard, another relative in a Medieval Princess gown and pointy hat (who appeared in the episode \\"Disaster Becomes You\\"), one dressed as a 1970s soul sister with a white streak of hair like Frankenstein's bride, and one with white hair in braided pigtails curved up like bullhorns with a spider web in the middle. The end of the episode suggests that the entire reunion was a dream, so the question remains how many of them are actually Misery cousins (such as Malady, Malaise, Mayhem, etc.) and how many are from Misery's imagination as they just look like Misery in different getups from other episodes (Motley, Mopey, the 1970s Soul Sister, etc.). =Bunny= A pink bunny with red eyes, he pretends to be a cute and loving bunny with a cold, but is actually evil. He wanted to steal everything from Ruby's mansion. Doom Kitty was the only one who knew he was evil. Later everyone else finds out this bunny is evil when Doom Kitty traps him in a cage and everyone saw their stuff in his carriage, so they kicked him out. =Gunther and Uta= Two twins with a German accent who came to live in the Gloom household, after their run- in with a witch and her gingerbread house. They thought Ruby and her friends were about to get rid of them despite knowing that what Ruby and her friends do delights everyone else. Episodes These are the episodes that have aired on television. Most of the episodes contain a short skit at the beginning and end of the episodes, \\"Gloomer Rumor\\", the first episode of the series, is the only episode to have no opening skit, but an ending skit. =Season 1 (2006‚Äì07)Season 2 (2007)Season 3 (2007‚Äì08)=Broadcast Ruby Gloom premiered on YTV in Canada on October 13, 2006. In the United Kingdom, the series aired on Pop and Pop Girl in 2008. Channel RT√â Two in Ireland broadcast the series in 2010. Australian channels ABC1 and ABC3 carried the series in 2008. More recently, as of 2020, the series has become available on demand via YouTube. In 2011 the channel Hub Network aired the series in the US, however the reruns lasted for a short period of time. Awards and honors Ruby Gloom was nominated for a 2014 Gemini Award in the category of \\"Best Animated Program or Series.\\" The script for episode \\"Yam Ween\\", written by Carolyn Bennett, was a finalist in the 2007 Canadian Screenwriting Awards . Website The product line had an interactive website where users could chat in a forum, and click around for free things such as desktop icons and screensavers. The words: \\"Ruby Gloom is happy in her own way. Even though she is frowning, to her, a frown is only a smile upside down. In fact, Ruby is so happy, she could just die\\" greeted viewers as they entered the website. Towards the end of 2004 the website changed to forum only dubbed \\"The Mansion\\" By the end of 2004 the website had been redesigned and featured an interactive mansion to explore and user submitted artwork. Ruby is shown on the roof with her cat Doom and was given a smile for the first time. By 2006 \\"The Mansion\\" forum was removed, and the website had taken on its show format geared more towards kids. Reception Ruby Gloom received generally positive reviews from both critics and audiences, praising it for its characters, writing, soundtrack, and plot. Common Sense Media gave the series a rating of four stars out of five, saying: \\"A nice mix of sweet-and-sour, Ruby Gloom's dark gothic setting underscores all the cooperation and kindness. Adults will enjoy jokes that kids may miss, such as when it's revealed that Ruby eats Glum Flakes cereal for breakfast. And all but the most sensitive kids will be too enraptured by fantastic elements like talking pictures and a school for ghosts to be unnerved by dark elements like Misery's constant talk of disasters and death\\". As stated above, the series was nominated for a 2014 Gemini Award in the category of \\"Best Animated Program or Series.

It is named after the philanthropist John Kyrle (1637‚Äì1724), known as \\"The Man of Ross\\".  History  The former Grammar School buildings The school site was opened in 1953 and was Herefordshire's first secondary modern school. The Ross-on-Wye Grammar School and secondary modern school (the Overross School) were merged in 1979 to form a single comprehensive school called John Kyrle High School. In August 1979, the Lower School site, the former grammar school, was badly damaged by fire. This site was closed in 1997. The site of the current school covers about 15 acres. The building was constructed during the Second World War and, although planned as a 500 pupil school, it also acted as an emergency hospital in case of severe bombings. The main corridors and rooms off it were built in such a way that it could be used as a hospital. The Ross-on-Wye Secondary Modern opened on the site in 1953, although it was intended to be a boys' school that could provide support 500 pupils. At this time there were only 14 classrooms, a science room, an art room, two craft rooms, two domestic science rooms, library, two handicraft rooms, gymnasium with changing rooms, entrance and exhibition hall, an assembly hall, administration block, dining room and kitchens. The cost of the building and grounds to Herefordshire County Council was ¬£122,250 not including equipment.  Awards  The school has been awarded Technology college status, among other awards for its large investment in Interactive White Boards and a large amount of computer facilities. The school also recently received an ofsted \\"good\\" school award in 2017. It became a New Converter Academy in January 2010 following the Headteacher attending a presentation given by the Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Education in Downing Street.

In 2019, the sixth form's performance put it in the top 2% of sixth forms nd colleges nationally.  Royal visit  On Friday 11 July 2003, Queen Elizabeth II visited the school on her tour of the West Midlands region. She was led around the school by the headteacher, Mr Nigel Griffiths, and ended by talking to some of the children about the school. Main areas on the tour of the school were the refurbished Design and Technology rooms, the ICT Department and the Art Block.  Development  Over the years there has been much work done to the school, including lifts for disabled access to upper floors, refurbishment of the canteen, a Sixth Form Common Room, an astroturf pitch, and most recently a new music block. But most recently a maths block and a gym, also refurbished of some of the school. John Kyrle High School also offers many clubs and extra-curricular activities, most of which are sport-related.

Woldemar Bargiel (3 October 182823 February 1897) was a German composer. Life Bargiel was born in Berlin, and was the younger maternal half-brother of Clara Schumann. Bargiel‚Äôs father Adolph was a well- known piano and voice teacher while his mother Marianne Tromlitz had previously been unhappily married to Clara‚Äôs father, Friedrich Wieck. Clara was nine years older than Woldemar. Throughout their lives, they enjoyed a warm relationship. The initial opportunities which led to the success and recognition he enjoyed were due to Clara, who introduced him to both Robert Schumann and Felix Mendelssohn. Bargiel received his first lessons at home and later with the well-known Berlin teacher of music theory Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn. Upon the suggestion of Schumann and the recommendation of Mendelssohn, Bargiel at age 16 went to study at the famous Leipzig Conservatory with some of the leading men of music: Ignaz Moscheles (piano) and Niels Gade (composition), and also with Julius Rietz.Stowell, Robin (2003). . Cambridge University Press. page 346. . After leaving Leipzig in 1850, he returned to Berlin where he tried to make ends meet by giving private lessons. Eventually, Clara and Robert were able to arrange for the publication of some of his early works, including his First Piano Trio. Subsequently, Bargiel held positions at the conservatories in Cologne and Rotterdam (where he met Hermine Tours, his future wife, sister of the composer Berthold Tours) before accepting a position at the prestigious Hochschule fur Musik in Berlin where he taught for the rest of his life. Among his many students were Paul Juon, Waldemar von Bau√ünern, Alexander Ilyinsky and Leopold Godowsky. Besides teaching and composing, Bargiel served with Brahms as co-editor of the complete editions of Schumann's and Chopin's works. While Bargiel did not write a lot of music, most of what he composed was well thought out and shows solid musical craftsmanship.

She was played by actress Doris Speed from the series' first episode in 1960 until Speed retired from the role 23 years and 1,737 episodes later in 1983. Speed appeared as a guest of honour at the 30th birthday celebration of Coronation Street in 1990 which was hosted by Cilla Black. The character of Annie has been noted as \\"snobbish\\" and \\"snooty\\" due to her condescending attitude and delusions of grandeur. Despite this, Annie proved to be one of the show's most popular characters and Speed received more fan mail than any other cast member at the time. For her service, Speed was later declared a \\"national treasure\\" by the media and received an MBE in 1977. Creation Annie was one of the original characters in Coronation Street when the show began in 1960. Creator Tony Warren wrote the part with Doris Speed in mind, having worked with her before when he was a young actor on radio play Children's Hour. As the immaculately kept manager of the Rovers Return Inn, Annie appeared in the very first episode, broadcast live on 9 December 1960 and in the following episode her mild-mannered husband of over twenty years Jack (Arthur Leslie) was introduced. The pair went on to become the first great 'double act' of the series, and following the series' early success, Jack and Annie's two children were introduced - Billy (Ken Farrington) and Joan (June Barry), who arrived for Joan's wedding to teacher Gordon Davies (Calvin Malone) in 1961. =Departure= In 1983, a year of immense change for Coronation Street, the Daily Mirror published a story claiming that Doris Speed was many years older than she had claimed. Speed had claimed to be 70; she was in fact 84 at the time. Speed collapsed on seeing the article and was quickly written out of the show to give the elderly actress time to recover. Shortly afterwards however, her home was burgled and Speed was admitted into a nursing home. She opted not to return to Coronation Street, and Annie made her final appearance on 12 October 1983. It is perhaps fitting that her last ever line on the show was \\"Could you please give me three tins of anything, so that I can discharge my duty and go?\\" to Rita Fairclough (Barbara Knox) at a Bring & Buy sale. Storylines Jack (Arthur Leslie) and Annie Walker were a popular couple in Coronation Street, and made a good team as landlord and landlady of the Rovers. However, Jack and Annie came close to splitting up in 1964 when Annie found out Jack had been making regular payments to a Mrs. Nicholls, and wrongly assumed she was a lover. The reality was that Jack was paying their son Billy's (Kenneth Farrington) rent as Billy had lost his job, but Annie left Jack instead of confronting him, and only came to regret her hastiness when coping without Jack at Egremont Hotel proved too much for her. Though innocent, Jack remained concerned that Annie would not return, though she eventually did and was deeply apologetic. Later that year, the Walkers took in 15-year-old Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss) as a ward when her father Harry (Ivan Beavis) and stepmother Concepta Hewitt (Doreen Keogh) moved to Ireland. Concepta had previously been a live-in barmaid at the Rovers before marrying Harry, and the Hewitts and the Walkers had been close. When Lucille refused to go with her parents, Annie volunteered to put her up while she finished her O-levels. Lucille was a different challenge to Annie than Billy or her daughter Joan (June Barry) had been. Annie refused to modernise her parenting approach, and found Lucille flighty and irresponsible, while Lucille found Annie cold and difficult to talk to, becoming closer to Jack. Annie was an active member of the community and in 1966 her aspirations turned political, when Mrs Arkinstall (Lally Bowers) of the Federation of Women's Associations agreed to sponsor her application to stand as an independent candidate in the Council by-elections. She quickly got caught up in electioneering duties, putting them even above her duties as landlady. She was up against neighbour Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson), who during a debate accused Annie of being a mouthpiece for snotty women. They received the same number of votes on election day, and on a coin toss Len was elected Councillor. The Walkers had another of their meaningless fall-outs in 1967 when Annie was dissatisfied with Jack's answers to a truth game and refused to let the matter drop, causing Jack to sleep in the spare room and later Albert Tatlock's (Jack Howarth) house to get away from Annie's nagging. Annie, unsure of where Jack was staying, got the mistaken impression that he was sleeping over at Elsie Tanner's (Pat Phoenix) house, and convinced herself they were having an affair. Jack couldn't believe Annie could think something so far-fetched but reassured her that he loved her and they reconciled. In 1968, Lucille became involved with Gordon Clegg (Bill Kenwright), an accounting student whose protective mother Maggie Cooke (Irene Sutcliffe) had recently bought the Corner Shop. Annie objected to Gordon, fearing that his father Les's (John Sharp) alcoholism was hereditary, and because she suspected Maggie thought Gordon was too good for Lucille. The lovelorn couple ran away to get married but missed the train to Gretna Green and returned home, to their parents' relief. Annie's attitude towards Gordon changed when he became a qualified accountant - a man of education. The following year, Annie was once again on the wrong side of her children, with her racism against Billy's girlfriend Jasmine Choong (Lucille Soong) causing Billy and Jasmine to split up. Annie was thrilled in 1969 when brewery rep Douglas Cresswell (William Fox) offered her and Jack a pub in Majorca, while she was there after winning the 'Perfect Landlady' competition arranged by Newton & Ridley. It was the chance she had been waiting for years, and for her sake Jack was also willing to go, however they were turned down at the last minute when Cresswell's boss decided they were too old to run the Majorca bar. It was a sad day in 1970 when Jack had a heart attack and died while visiting Joan in Derby. Annie was distraught but despite her grief was able to carry on with her job, taking over as licensee of the Rovers Return, with Billy moving to Weatherfield to keep an eye in her and help out at the pub when needed. The brewery was satisfied that with Billy around Annie could continue to function as landlady, though they did offer to make Billy licensee behind Annie's back, believing he would be the more ideal landlord, an offer he turned down. Lucille's future continued to worry Annie. After gaining good qualifications, Lucille grew into a lazy young woman who worked when it suited her, and when she did have a job, it tended to be somewhere Annie disapproved of, such as the Aquarius disco club, which to add insult to injury, was a Newton & Ridley house like the Rovers. She once offered to buy the Corner Shop for Lucille, but Lucille wasn't interested. Lucille eventually left for good in 1974 to live with Concepta in Ireland. Annie's big moment finally came in 1973 when incoming Mayor of Weatherfield, Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley), asked her to be his Mayoress and she accepted it graciously. However, no sooner had Annie and Alf been sworn in than Annie found out that Billy had been gambling using the pub's takings. Furious, Annie made barmaid Betty Turpin (Betty Driver) manager and cut off Billy's access to the Rovers' accounts, and the pair had a blazing row. Billy decided to leave Weatherfield to rebuild his life in Jersey, while Annie told the brewery she was retiring as there was now nothing left for her at the Rovers. She changed her mind when the regulars showed her a petition they'd written, signed by 46 people, telling the brewery that she was the only landlady they wanted. Billy made another return to Weatherfield in 1974, soon to be engaged to Deirdre Hunt (Anne Kirkbride). Annie threw herself into wedding preparations, although secretly she didn't think much of Deirdre and disapproved of Billy paying for the wedding instead of Deirdre's widowed mother Blanche (Maggie Jones). With three weeks to go, Billy called off the wedding, deciding he no longer wanted to marry Deirdre, and returned to Jersey. Although she was now living by herself at the Rovers, Annie did not inform the brewery of Billy's departure as she feared they would retire her. Later in the year, two thugs, Les Grimes (Mike Grady) and Neil Foxall (Terence Budd), broke into the Rovers in the night in search of valuables and money. Despite being unable to defend herself, Annie refused to be intimidated and defiantly told them her money was in the bank (in fact, there was money on the premises which she kept in a safe place). The thugs left after searching the place and finding nothing of value, and despite telling friends and staff she was fine Annie fell down the stairs the next day and was admitted to hospital. The brewery then discovered Annie's true living situation, however she was held in high enough esteem that she was offered the tenancy of a pub in Cheshire, rather than retirement. When informed of the brewery's decision by Warren Coates (Peter Settelen), an unflappable Annie immediately telephoned Douglas Cresswell, who put a stop to the plans. However, she agreed to take on a live-in cellarman, and hired pot-bellied widower Fred Gee (Fred Feast). In her final years at the Rovers, age was no obstacle to Annie, and she continued to rule with an iron fist. In 1976, when her business was threatened by Renee Bradshaw's (Madge Hindle) application to turn the Corner Shop into an off- licence, Annie petitioned against her, but the matter was settled in court in favour of Renee. At 67, Annie decided to learn to drive, and to pass her test after fewer than 86 lessons - the number her friend and rival Nellie Harvey (Mollie Sugden) had taken. To the surprise of all (after her first lesson ended with her hitting a lamp post), she passed her test first time and bought a second-hand Rover 2000. Not long after getting the car, Annie was stopped by the police while doing a turn in the road, and was breathalysed. Much to her horror, the crystal turned green. A blood test taken at the police station proved Annie was below the limit, but by that time her companion Kitty Stonely (Stella Moray) had already spread the word among Annie's posh friends at the Lady Victuallers. In 1977, the brewery held a party in the Rovers celebrating Annie's four decades as landlady, with Billy arriving as a surprise guest. The following year, a take-over bid at the brewery nearly caused Annie to step down as landlord in favour of Billy - to guarantee she could stay at the Rovers - but the bid fell through at the last minute. In 1979, Billy returned again to ask Annie for a loan to buy a wine bar. Annie was willing to give him the money but retracted the offer when Billy asked Deirdre to come with him; Deirdre was now a married woman, although separated. When Deirdre decided not to go with Billy, Annie handed the money over. In 1981, Annie went on a cruise and left temporary manager Gordon Lewis (David Daker) in charge of the Rovers, as she didn't have faith in Fred to run it. She was shocked when she returned to find Gordon had replaced her staff. After relieving Gordon from his post, she had to earn back the respect of Betty and Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), who were angry that Annie hadn't trusted them. For the majority of her later years, Annie had four staff: Bet, Betty, Fred and cleaner Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander). Out of them, Annie held Fred in especially low regard. When he married Eunice Nuttall (Meg Johnson) in 1981, Annie offered to let them live at the Rovers while they looked for a pub of their own. When they were turned down by the brewery because Eunice had been accused of stealing, Annie still wanted them out as she had found a new cellarman who was ready to start work. Fred later split from Eunice and Annie let him keep his job. In late 1983, Annie took a break from the Rovers to stay with Joan, and in early 1984 her son Billy arrived to declare that his mother was \\"bowing out\\"; Annie had decided to retire without returning to tell her staff and friends personally. She convinced Billy to run the pub though his stay was very brief, as he had to sell the tenancy of the Rovers to pay his debts. Annie‚Äôs death was never addressed in the show but subsequent references to her were in the past tense. After Betty's death in 2012, while clearing out Betty's house, Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox), Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) and Stella Price (Michelle Collins) found a copy of Annie's will, in which she bequeathed various items to Betty, Billy, Lucille and Concepta. A further letter, from Annie to Betty, said that Annie had wanted Betty to take over the running of the Rovers after her death.

Searches turned up no sign of her and investigators believe it unlikely that she had fallen overboard. There have been possible sightings of Bradley in Cura√ßao; in 1998, tourists had seen a woman resembling Bradley on a beach, and in 1999, a member of the U.S. Navy claimed a woman in a brothel had said she was Bradley and had asked him for help.  Case history  On March 21, 1998, Amy Lynn Bradley, her parents Ron and Iva, and her brother Brad, left for a weeklong cruise on Rhapsody of the Seas. On the morning of March 24, Bradley had been drinking with the ship's band, Blue Orchid, in the dance club. One of the band members named Alister Douglas, known as Yellow, claimed he parted ways with Bradley at about 1 am. Some time between 5:15 and 5:30 am, Bradley's father, Ron, saw her asleep on the cabin balcony. When he got up at 6 am, however, she was no longer there. He later said, \\"I left to try and go up and find her. When I couldn't find her, I didn't really know what to think, because it was very much unlike Amy to leave and not tell us where she was going.\\" The ship had left Oranjestad, Aruba and was en route to Cura√ßao, Antilles at the time Bradley was last seen and docked there shortly after it was realized that she had gone missing. Extensive searches on the ship and at sea produced no signs of her whereabouts. The Netherlands Antilles Coast Guard conducted a four-day search that ended on March 27, and Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines chartered a boat to continue looking for her, but they ended their search on March 29. Bradley was a trained lifeguard and investigators said there was no evidence that she had fallen overboard and none that she died by suicide either. There were possible sightings of Bradley in Cura√ßao in 1998 and 1999. Two Canadian tourists reported seeing a woman resembling Amy on a beach in Cura√ßao in August 1998. The woman's tattoos were reportedly identical to Bradley's, and one of the two men said he was ‚Äútwo feet away from her‚Äù and said he was sure it was her with complete full certainty. Bradley's tattoos included a Tasmanian Devil spinning a basketball located on her shoulder, the sun placed on her lower back, a Chinese symbol located on her right ankle, and a gecko lizard on her navel. She also had a navel ring. A member of the United States Navy stated that he had seen Bradley in a brothel in 1999. He claimed she told him that \\"her name was Amy Bradley and [she] begged him for help,\\" explaining that she was held against her will and not allowed to leave. There was another potential sighting in 2005, when a witness named Judy Maurer claimed to have seen Bradley in a department store restroom in Barbados. The witness claimed a woman entered the restroom accompanied by three men, who proceeded to threaten her if she did not follow through on a deal. The witness alleges that after the men had left, she approached the distraught woman who then said that her first name was Amy and that she was from Virginia before the men re-entered to take her away. Maurer called authorities, and they created composite sketches of three men and the woman based on her account. Bradley's mother and father appeared on the November 17, 2005 episode of Dr. Phil. An image of a young woman resembling Bradley that was emailed to her parents was shown on the program, and it suggests that she might have been sold into sexual slavery. There is currently a $250,000 reward offered by the Bradley family for information leading to Bradley's return and a $50,000 reward for information leading to her verifiable location. The FBI is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to her recovery. Her case has been featured on America's Most Wanted and by the television show Disappeared. It was also the subject of episode 59 of the Casefile podcast. It has also appeared on the podcast Crime Junkie. Renewed attention was paid to her case after the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in 2005.

Other important roles were David (Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg), Loge (Das Rheingold), Aegisth (Elektra) and Herod (Salome). He also sang the Captain in Wozzeck and, the roles of Oberon (A Midsummer Night's Dream) and the Emperor Nero, both of which were originally written for countertenor.

It was established in the mid-1990s following the closure of the station by the Metro-North Railroad, and primarily focuses on the history of railroading in southern New England and neighboring New York. In addition to the former station building, the museum has a collection of heritage railcars in the neighboring rail yard it shares with Metro-North. The station was built in 1903 by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in response to local pressure for a new station after the three railroads that served the city were merged into the New Haven. At its peak period 125 trains stopped there in a day. In 1993 that had dwindled to a few commuter trains, and the Connecticut Department of Transportation, which by then owned the neglected building, closed it in favor of a newer station on the other side of the block. Within two years the museum was formed and restored the station to its former appearance. It is architecturally distinctive, with Colonial Revival touches on a Richardsonian Romanesque structure. Alfred Hitchcock filmed station scenes for Strangers on a Train on its distinctive curved platform. In 1986, prior to the museum's use of the building, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was joined on the Register in 2005 by the former turntable, the only intact one in the state. Site alt=A model train display with the station building at the left lower corner with various types of trains on the tracks next to the station and the railyard. A sign above it, on the upper left, reads \\"Danbury Railyard in the 1950s\\" Danbury station, ca. 1910 The museum itself is located on a curved lot at the southeast corner of White Street and Patriot Drive, just across from Meeker's Hardware, also on the Register. To its west is a parking lot with room for 25 cars. Immediately behind it, to the south, are the railroad tracks and a rail yard. The current Danbury station is a short distance away, and sometimes Metro-North stores its trains on the tracks behind the station between runs. The museum's collection of older cars is on the tracks in the yard's interior. A grade crossing on White marks the eastern terminus of the Beacon Line kept in reserve by Metro-North for possible future use. =Building= The station building is a one-story L-shaped structure of buff and brown brick with sandstone trim, , both wings topped with gabled roofs covered in asphalt. Hipped-roof dormer windows pierce the north and west elevations, and similar canopies run along the tracks on either side, continuing the overhanging bracketed eaves that shelter the platform on the building itself. A single chimney rises from the south end of the station, near where the sets of tracks meet. Windows vary in size and shape. Those on the east are high and small, whereas tall windows that give the impression of sidelights are along the southwest, next to the tracks. These are hints of the Colonial Revival style that was emerging at the time of the station's construction. Inside, the museum's exhibits and displays occupy the southern half of the building, its former waiting room. In the northern half, is the museum's gift shop and restrooms. The original ticket window and the varnished pine door and window architraves. Immediately east of the entry is a fireplace whose mantel is decorated in molded brick in floral patterns. The facility comprises a railroad yard full of restored and unrestored railroad equipment, and the restored station house containing exhibits of photographs and railroad paraphernalia, model train layouts, an extensive reference library, and a gift shop. The station is \\"significant in the history of Danbury\\" and also as a \\"good example\\" of a turn-of-the-twentieth-century railway station building. Its architectural style of the hip-roofed station is eclectic, with exterior Richardsonian and Colonial Revival elements. Its interior workmanship is more impressive. =Yard= Four diesel locomotives lined up at the historic rail yard New York Central 2013, an EMD FL9, sits in the yard with a Metro-North train in the background Visitors can ride the \\"Rail Yard Local\\" on weekends in the summer season. The ride takes about 30‚Äì35 minutes and includes a unique ride by the passengers on the museum's operating turntable, and a tour of the recently restored Danbury fairground's pumphouse. The turntable was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 15, 2005. The turntable, built around 1914 was originally part of a roundhouse and machine shop complex. A fire destroyed the buildings in the 1980's, leaving \\"the only intact surviving [railroad] turntable in Connecticut\\". It is essentially a swing bridge, and is located several hundred yards east of the station. and Some of the rolling stock in the yard, including its 1907-built 2-6-0 steam locomotive (B&M; #1455), two cabooses, a Budd Company self-propelled rail diesel car, and a Sperry track inspection car, are open to the visitors. The museum is an all-volunteer operation and welcomes anyone who would like to participate in any of the many facets of its operations ‚Äì including operating its locomotives and self-propelled cars. History By the 1880s, the three railroads that served the city ‚Äî the Danbury and Norwalk, Housatonic and New York and New England ‚Äî had built small, separate stations for their lines in the vicinity of the current building. Later in that decade, economic difficulties led to them all becoming part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford, leading it to be known locally as the Consolidated Road. Citizens began asking the new owner to consolidate its three stations into one as early as 1894, two years after the last merger. In 1901, the Consolidated realigned the tracks and built the new station where the New York & New England's passenger depot had been. A. Malkin's design combined a basic Richardsonian Romanesque structure with some Colonial Revival details, like the small panes in the windows. It was said to be the largest station on the New Haven's New York Division. In its peak years, early in the 20th century, extant timetables suggest the station saw as many as 125 trains a day. Much of that passenger traffic was related to the city's large hatmaking industry, with workers migrating to and from jobs, and business travelers selling to or buying from the hatmakers. It was acknowledged with a neon sign on a nearby coal shed showing a derby hat coming down on a crown and saying \\"Danbury Crowns Them All\\". The hat-related traffic grew around the industry's two big seasons, the Christmas and Easter holidays. Other passengers were commuters going to jobs in Bridgeport or New York City, summer travelers headed for country retreats and hotels in the area, or visitors to the Danbury Fair, held every October. After World War II, train ridership began to decline with the rise of passenger air travel and the Interstate Highway System. The decline of hatmaking, as many Americans started going around bareheaded, also contributed. Many of the station's original decorative features were removed. The New Haven's passenger train services to northwestern Connecticut, the Berkshires and to Pittsfield, Massachusetts were cut to weekend-only service by 1961. The last named train on the route, the Berkshire, was discontinued in 1968. In the late 1960s the Consolidated was itself absorbed into the short- lived Penn Central conglomerate. The last intercity passenger train left for Pittsfield in 1972, and the next year the Penn Central's final failure put its trains in the hands of Conrail and the station itself became property of the state Department of Transportation (ConnDOT). Metro-North closed the station, the northern terminus of the New Haven Line's Danbury Branch, in 1993. The city's mayor, Gene Eriquez, who had seen downtown wither as retail business and customers went to the mall built on the former fairgrounds, did not want to see another old building lost to urban blight. The station seemed to him and others the ideal place for a rail museum that could attract visitors, and the Danbury Railway Museum was formed the next year by a group of National Railway Historical Society and local railfans. Soon it grew to a hundred members. The first excursion train was run later that year. A temporary museum was established in an Ives Street storefront while the old station itself was restored with a $1.5 million grant. In late 1995 the restored station was rededicated at a ceremony attended by the mayor and a thousand people. The museum interior was opened in the middle of the following year. The turntable was restored in 1998. Since 2005 it has been a regular stop on the Railyard Local. Today the museum has 550 members and 60 pieces of equipment.

Originally built as a cinema in 1921, The Avalon was billed as the \\"Showplace of the Eastern Shore.\\" Today serves as the prime venue of the Mid-Shore area for performing arts, nationally and locally. Overview In 1934, the Schine Chain Theatres purchased the Avalon and renovated it with an art deco theme. It would become one of the most famous movie houses in the area, hosting three world premieres, including The First Kiss, starring Gary Cooper. The theater eventually fell into disrepair and closed its doors in 1985. In 1989, it was restored as a performing arts center and then purchased in 1992 by the town of Easton. The Avalon is currently operated by The Avalon Foundation, a non- profit organization. The Avalon has since become a major music venue and center for community events in the area. HistoryEarly= Built in 1921, at the cost of $100,000, The Avalon Theatre immediately became, as one newspaper reporter proclaimed, the \\"Showplace of the Eastern Shore.\\" Visually spectacular, another newspaper reporter made the bold statement that \\"no house in the South will compare with all its detail.\\" That detail included leaded glass doors at every theater entrance, an 18 foot dome with 148 lights, a 300 pipe electric-pneumatic organ, an electric player piano, and a ballroom on the second floor. =Middle= However, when the Schine Theatre Chain purchased the Theatre in 1934, they completely refitted the building. Schine closed the ballroom, and redesigned the theater with an Art Deco theme that still stands today. In the process of the makeover, the theater lost many of its accoutrements in favor of the Art Deco theme, but its reputation as a movie house grew quickly. Generations of Eastern Shore movie-goers saw Clark Gable‚Äôs first screen kiss, Bette Davis‚Äô first psychotic role, and Roy Rogers‚Äô first gunfight at the Avalon. Three world premieres took place at the Avalon including \\"The First Kiss\\" starring Gary Cooper and Fay Rae, which was filmed in Easton and St. Michaels. The Avalon‚Äôs standing as Easton‚Äôs premier movie house ended in 1985 after a 64-year run. Suffering from mildew, cracks in the walls, stained carpeting and rickety seats, the Avalon closed in 1985 and remained dark until November 1987. =Later= Under the leadership of Easton Mayor George Murphy, renovations began in late 1987 to restore the Theatre to its former glory. Finished in 1989, the Avalon was magnificently restored and upgraded to a performing arts center, retaining its proscenium stage, domed ceiling, and incredible acoustics. The Theatre did not immediately thrive following the renovations, however. Following the 1.36 million dollar makeover, the Theatre was sold to the Mid-Shore Center for the Performing Arts, which was unsuccessful in managing it profitably. In order to save the Theatre, it was repurchased at auction in 1992 by its sole bidder - the Town of Easton. After intensive discussion and analysis by a planning group, the town decided to turn the operation over to a non-profit corporation, its Board of Trustees and professional management. In 1994, the town entered a lease agreement with the Avalon Foundation, Inc., founded by John and Ellen General. Soon there after, the historic Avalon Theatre began its rapid growth under their leadership as a center for the performing arts and community events. Since the Avalon Foundation took over, the Theatre has been provided with state of the art sound and lighting, video projectors, television production facilities, and a friendly but elegant atmosphere.https://avalonfoundation.org/node/3069 References Category:Easton, Maryland Category:Theatres completed in 1921 Category:Theatres in Maryland Category:Music venues in Maryland Category:Art Deco architecture in Maryland Category:Buildings and structures in Talbot County, Maryland Category:Tourist attractions in Talbot County, Maryland ","title":"Avalon Theatre"},{"id":"2759061","text":"Avalon Theater or Theatre may refer to: * Avalon Theater (Catalina), California; now known as Catalina Casino * Avalon Theatre, Easton, Maryland * Avalon Theater (Brooklyn), New York * Avalon Theater (Larimore, North Dakota), listed on the National Register of Historic Places * Avalon Theatre (Portland, Oregon), a movie theatre * Avalon Theatre (Washington, D.C.), listed on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Buildings and structures disambiguation pages ","title":"Avalon Theater"},{"id":"2759069","text":"James Wilson (July 23, 1900 ‚Äì May 31, 1947), nicknamed \\"Ace,\\" was an American professional athlete in soccer and baseball. He began his professional sports career as a soccer outside right in the National Association Football League and American Soccer League before becoming a catcher, manager and coach in Major League Baseball. Wilson was the starting catcher for the National League in baseball's first All-Star game. He threw and batted right-handed and was listed at tall and . Soccer Wilson, the son of Scottish immigrants, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he grew up in the Kensington neighborhood of the city. He left school when he was 14 to work in a local textile mill. In 1919, he left the mills when he began playing as an outside forward with Philadelphia Merchant Ship B in the National Association Football League. During his time with the team, he met Dick Spalding, another two sport athlete, whom he later hired as his first base coach when Wilson managed the Phillies and Cubs. After Merchant Ship folded following the 1919-1920 season, Wilson moved to Bethlehem Steel F.C., signing with the team in July 1920. During his time in Bethlehem, he also played catcher for the steel company's baseball team which competed in the Steel League. In 1921, Wilson signed with Harrison S.C. in the newly established American Soccer League. He played thirteen league and three National Challenge Cup games, scoring four goals. During the 1922-1923 season, he played four games for Philadelphia Field Club before leaving the sport to concentrate on his baseball career. Baseball Baseball card of Wilson During his years playing first division soccer, Wilson also made a name for himself as an excellent baseball player. When he signed with Bethlehem Steel in July 1920, the local newspaper stated, \\"The addition of Wilson would be a most welcome one, because his campaigning on the baseball diamond has been as brilliant as that in soccer circles. At present he is on the receiving end of the battery for the New Haven team in the Eastern League.\\" In February 1923, he gave up his soccer career when he was traded from New Haven in the Eastern League to the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League for Stan Baumgartner and Jack Withrow. Wilson's National League playing career would stretch over 18 seasons (1923‚Äì40) with the Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals and the Cincinnati Reds. He hit over .300 four times as a regular catcher and for his career batted .284 in 1,525 games. In 1928, he joined baseball history when he was traded by the Phillies to the Cardinals during a game between the two teams. According to one account, \\"Wilson was a Phil for two innings, then darted into Redbird regalia, and sat on the St. Louis bench, for the remainder of the game.\\" After the 1933 season, he was traded back to the Phillies for fellow catcher Spud Davis and infielder Eddie Delker. From 1934 through 1938, he was the player- manager of his hometown Phillies, one of the worst teams in baseball at the time. He guided the Phils to three seventh place and two eighth (last) place finishes; in his final season, Philadelphia lost 103 of 149 games. He then joined the Cincinnati coaching staff in 1939 and played only four games that season. Wilson umpired a major league game in 1940, under unusual circumstances. A game on April 23 between the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals had been postponed, and when it was about to be played at Crosley Field on May 13, it was found that no umpires had been assigned by the National League. Umpire Larry Goetz, who lived in Cincinnati, was summoned to the ballpark and served as home plate umpire. Wilson umpired at first base, and Cardinals' pitcher Lon Warneke umpired at third base. The game ended as an 8‚Äì8 tie after 14 innings, called due to darkness. In August 1940, the Reds were stunned when Willard Hershberger, backup catcher to future Baseball Hall of Famer Ernie Lombardi, committed suicide in his Boston hotel room. The 40-year-old Wilson came off the coaching lines and joined the active roster, serving as the club's third catcher behind Lombardi and rookie Bill Baker. He played three games in August, but then in September Lombardi injured his ankle, and Wilson was pressed into starting duty. Splitting time with Baker and Dick West, Wilson played in 16 games during the pennant race, batting .243. When Lombardi was unable to return for more than spot duty in the 1940 World Series, Wilson came through, batting .353 in six games and playing a key role in Cincinnati's defeat of the Detroit Tigers, four games to three, for the world championship. His stardom in the 1940 Fall Classic led to his second and last major league managing job, with the Chicago Cubs (1941‚Äì44), but he never had a winning record in Wrigleyville and his highest finish was fifth, in 1943. The following season, Wison resigned as manager of the Cubs after the team followed up an opening day victory with nine straight defeats to open the season.Jimmy Wilson resigns as manager of Chicago Cubs He was replaced by Roy Johnson for one game before Charlie Grimm took over as manager of the Cubs. His final record as a manager, over nine full or partial seasons was: 493 wins and 735 losses (.401). Wilson returned to Cincinnati as a coach in 1945‚Äì46. Released along with Reds manager Bill McKechnie at the end of the 1946 season, Wilson moved to Florida and entered the citrus growing business. He died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 46 the following May in Bradenton. Personal Wilson was also the father of 2nd Lt. Robert J. Wilson, a B-29 Flight Crew member who died in a training accident in Kharagpur, India November 28, 1944.

Fictional character biography Flatman's real name is actually Matt. After dropping out of community college, he worked as a barista when he was approached by a party organizer named Andrew. Matt worked for him pretending to be Mister Fantastic. He grew sick of the job and changed his name to Dr. Val Ventura in the hopes of becoming a superhero.The Great Lakes Avengers #3 (2016) Flatman became a member and second-in-command of the Great Lakes Avengers, an unauthorized division of the regular Avengers superhero group.

At first, Flatman denied any claims that he is gay. However, when a new Avenger recruit called Living Lightning first approached the Great Lakes Avengers (usually abbreviated as GLA), he thought they were actually the Gay/Lesbian Alliance. After apologizing, he left quickly, but his willingness to come out to others gave Flatman the courage to do it himself.GLA: Misassembled #2 He revealed that he is in fact gay to his teammates, though he felt one-upped by Mr. Immortal being dubbed the pinnacle of human evolution (using the ambiguous phrase \\"Homo Supreme\\"). Over time, Flatman's doctoral degree began to come into question. He is not able to present a degree to prove his education and when asked by Doorman what he was a doctor of, he replies that he is a doctor of \\"stuff\\". When told by a fellow doctor (who had confused him for Mr. Fantastic) that time moved in only a single direction, Flatman asked which direction that was.GLA: Misassembled #3 =GLA: Misassembled= During the G.L.A. mini- series, the team took on Maelstrom who was trying to destroy the universe. After Dinah Soar's death, Mr. Immortal suffered a nervous break down and Flatman stepped up as deputy leader.

While in Central Park, they're saved by Squirrel Girl and her sidekick Monkey Joe from muggers. They later offer her to join the team and she accepts. Soon after, they hear an alarm on a nearby factory and encounter the Grasshopper, who was battling Batroc the Leaper and his lackeys. During the battle, Flatman offers Grasshopper membership in the team and he accepts. Seconds later, Zaran, one of Batroc's minions, kills him. Refusing to let the deaths of Dinah Soar and Grasshopper get him down, Flatman continued to try to persuade the team to further research Maelstrom's plans for universal destruction. However, it was not until Mr. Immortal regained his sanity that the team rallied together to defeat Maelstrom. During the final battle, Big Bertha tried to save Flatman, who was seemingly sucked into a vortex created from Maelstrom's device. However, it turned out that only his clothes had been sucked off and he was merely standing at an extreme angle so he wouldn't be seen naked. With the GLA possessing a stronger resolve than ever, they returned to their headquarters only for Flatman to find that Tony Stark had sent a cease and desist notice ordering them to stop using the Avengers name.

Bred by Bill Punch, his dam's sire was a son of a French champion, Tantieme. Bonecrusher was purchased by Peter Mitchell for just NZ$3,250 at the Waikato Yearling Sales, and was trained by Frank Ritchie. Peter also bought Bonecrusher's full brother. A chestnut, Bonecrusher was nicknamed Big Red - the same name as the champions Man o' War, Secretariat and Phar Lap.  Racing Career  Bonecrusher was the 'People's Champion,' loved by everyone who saw the fiery big chestnut in action. His trainer was Frank Ritchie, and his strapper was Frank Ritchie's son Shaune Ritchie. Frank was trying to establish himself in the top echelon of trainers, while Shaune was only sixteen-years- old and straight out of high school, determined to find his own path in the thoroughbred racing industry. \\"I was battling away, and although I had trained a Group winner in Australia, it was when he arrived that it really changed my life,\\" Frank Ritchie said. All up, Bonechrusher raced 44 times for 18 wins, 5 second places, and 12 third places. His races ranged from 880m to 2400m. He won 9 Group One races, 3 Group 2 races, and 2 Group 3 races, and earnt prizemoney of NZ$674,225 and Au$1,679,495. He was the first New Zealand racehorse to win over NZ$1 million in prize money, and his combined New Zealand and Australia career earnings were approximately 3 million dollars. Bonecrusher won four Group One races in New Zealand, including the New Zealand Derby, and six Group One races in Australia, including the Tancred Stakes, the Australian Derby, the Underwood Stakes, the Caulfield Stakes, the Cox Plate, and the Australian Cup. Mitchell purchased Bonecrusher for $3200 from the Claudelands Yearling sale and he first hit the track in August of 1984 where he won three of his first five starts as a juvenile including one at Group Three) level at Ellerslie before embarking on an ill-fated three race campaign in Australia. Brought home after three lacklustre runs he commenced his three- year-old campaign with four consecutive placings including finishing third behind Random Chance and Field Dancer in the 1985 Group One New Zealand 2000 Guineas run at 1600m at Riccarton. Ritchie was convinced that trip away was the making of the horse. \\"He had hurt himself in an incident on the truck before he went to Christchurch and missed a lot of work,\\" he said. \\"He went into the 2000 Guineas underdone and I thought at the time the race would either flatten him or bring him on and thankfully it was the latter.\\" Bonecrusher won his next seven starts straight including the Group One Bayer Classic (1600m) and the Group 1 New Zealand Derby (2400m), before defeating the older horses in the Group 1 Air New Zealand Stakes (2000m) at Ellerslie Racecourse in Auckland. Then he went to Sydney and he won the Group 1 H E Tancred Stakes (2400m) and finished off with a win in the Group 1 Australian Derby (2400m). Bonecrusher scaled his greatest heights in the spring of 1986 in the Cox Plate, where the athletic chestnut prevailed in the 'Race of the Century' with another New Zealand champion, Waverley Star. The two great horses went to war from the 600m mark and separated themselves from the rest of the field, with Bonecrusher narrowly prevailing in a titanic head-to-head struggle that caller Bill Collins summed up with the famous line \\"Bonecrusher races into equine immortality.\\" Amongst the enthralled onlookers was strapper and now successful trainer in his own right, Shaune Ritchie, who struggled to take in the wild scenes in the aftermath that followed. \\"I was sixteen and left school to go and look after the horse in Melbourne for that campaign,\\" Shaune Ritchie said. \\"It was a pretty big thing as back then an OE (overseas experience) wasn‚Äôt a normal thing so just to go to Australia was a big trip. After the race it was just amazing and I still remember the way the crowd stayed on to greet him and watch the presentation after the race. Australians are punters and normally when a race is finished, they are off to the bookies to bet on the next race coming up.\\" Later that year, Bonecrusher was the pre- post favourite against some of the world's best racehorses in the Japan Cup but contracted a virus in Tokyo, nearly lost his life, and had to withdraw from the race. The next year Bonecrusher had recovered from his illness and won the 1987 Australian Cup, beating At Talaq, and was named Horse of the Year in New Zealand and Australia for the 1986‚Äì1987 season. He was the first horse to be awarded both titles. He was also a Government appointed 'Equine Ambassador' for New Zealand in 1986. Bonecrusher continued to campaign at five, six, and seven years of age. He won three races in New Zealand, including a second Air New Zealand Stakes in 1988, but was unable to reach his previous heights in Australia.  Retirement  After retirement Bonecrusher was cared for by his owner, Peter Mitchell, on a property in Takanini. In retirement, he was a guest of the Moonee Valley Racing Club. His last public appearance was Derby Day in 2003. In 2010, he was inducted into the New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame. Bonecrusher was euthanised in June 2015 after contracting laminitis. Bonecrusher was buried beside the saddling paddock at Ellerslie Racecourse, as he won his first race, his first Group race, and all three of his New Zealand Group One races at Ellerslie. A bronze statue was set above him. The life-sized replica is of the champion racehorse in action and includes his famous shoulder scar and unique protruding tongue. At the end of the plaque below the statue, it says 'Bonecrusher: The Pride of Ellerslie' \\"To see Bonecrusher immortalised like this stirs a lot of emotion and brings back a lot of great memories,\\" his trainer Frank Ritchie said. \\"People still want to talk about him to this day and in a radio interview I did recently I think I spent three minutes talking about my runners in the Auckland Cup and the New Zealand Oaks, and another 17 minutes on Bonecrusher, a horse that retired 30 years ago.\\" \\"He didn‚Äôt have the brilliance of Black Caviar or the dominance of Winx, but why people loved him so much was his courage, and when it looked like he couldn‚Äôt win, he would win. I doubt that there has been a story written about Dad or I that hasn‚Äôt included Bonecrusher somewhere in it and I have no problem with that as who doesn‚Äôt want to be associated with such a wonderful animal.\\" \\"The fact that every day you go to Ellerslie you see the magnificent statue there of him, that he is buried underneath, is very special and it is very nice to have.\\" Bonecrusher's strapper, trainer Frank Ritchie's son Shaune Ritchie, is now a trainer based in Cambridge who trained 2010 New Zealand Derby winner Military Move, and 2006 New Zealand 2000 Guineas winner and runner-up in the 2007 Kelt Capital Stakes, Magic Cape.  Bonecrusher song  In October 1986, Bonecrusher's achievements on the track became the inspiration for a song released by fellow Ellerslie locals, Wayne Cann, Gordon Evans and John Scull. Titled \\"Tribute to a Champion\\", the song promoted Bonecrusher as a New Zealand Sports Ambassador, and featured lyrics which stated that he could be \\"the greatest since Phar Lap\\" and named him as the \\"pride of Ellerslie\\". While not available in stores, fans were asked to send orders through the \\"Bonecrusher Song Child Cancer Appeal\\", which donated NZ$1 from each sale to the child cancer foundation.

In science The process of forming a monatomic silver wire. Organic molecular wires have been proposed for use in optoelectronics. In fiction Among the earliest descriptions of a super-strong filament are the film The Man in the White Suit (1951), in which a scientist develops a monofilament cloth fibre that will never wear out, and Theodore Sturgeon's \\"The Incubi of Parallel X\\" (Planet Stories, Sep 1951), where a \\"molecularly condensed fibre\\" is used as a zipline. An early example of a material similar to monomolecular wire deliberately used as a weapon and cutting tool is \\"borazon-tungsten filament\\" in G. Randall Garrett's \\"Thin Edge.\\" (Analog, Dec 1963) The main character uses a strand from an asteroid towing-cable to cut jail bars and to booby-trap the door of his room. Many later writers, including John Brunner, Frank Herbert, William Gibson and George R. R. Martin, have also used monomolecular or similar wire as a weapon or tool. Perhaps the best-known proposed use of monomolecular wire (\\"hyperfilament\\") is in the cables of a space elevator. Although there were a few earlier scientific papers suggesting the concept, a fully realized space elevator was first described in 1979 in Arthur Clarke's The Fountains of Paradise and Charles Sheffield's The Web Between the Worlds. The concept has been used in later fiction by Robert A. Heinlein, Iain M. Banks, Larry Niven and others.

Biography Manya Wilbushewitch (also Mania, Wilbuszewicz/Wilbushewitz; later Shochat) was born in the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus) to middle-class Jewish parents and grew up on the family estate near ≈Åoso≈õna. One of her brothers, Isaac, studied agriculture in Russia. He was expelled for slapping a professor who, in the course of a lecture, stated that the Jews were sucking the blood of the farmers in Ukraine. In late 1882, he left for Palestine and joined the Bilu movement. His letters home were a powerful influence on young Shochat.\\"Darki Be'Hashomer'\\" (My Path to Hashomer) Manya Schochat, in \\"Sefer Hashomer; Divrei Chaverim\\" A book edited and published by Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Israel Schochat, Mati Meged and Yochanan Tversky. Another one of her brothers, an engineer named Gedaliah, also went to Palestine in 1892 and helped fund his younger siblings' education. As a young adult, Shochat went to work in her brother's factory in Minsk to learn about working class conditions. In 1899, she was imprisoned because of her contacts with Bund revolutionaries. There, she was indoctrinated by Sergey Zubatov, the head of the Tsarist Secret Police in Moscow. Zubatov conceived a plan that fit with Shochat's ideological notions, through which workers would form \\"tame\\" organizations that would work for reform rather than for overthrow of the government. She was persuaded that this would also help achieve rights for Jews. Shochat proceeded to found the Jewish Independent Labor Party in 1901. The party was successful in leading strikes because the secret police supported it, but was loathed by the Bund and other Jewish socialist groups. The party collapsed in 1903 following the Kishinev pogrom. Experiencing, as she put it, 'severe emotional distress' following the loss and failure of her political organization and path, she accepted an invitation from her brother Nachum, who was the founder of the Shemen soap factory, to accompany him on a research expedition to some of the wilder places of Palestine. She arrived on January 2, 1904. > \\"I couldn't see what direction I should take in my life. I agreed to join my > brother's expedition, because, in fact, I was indifferent to everything. For > me it was just another adventure.\\"\\"My Path\\" > \\"The Hauran remained without a redeemer - and my soul cleaved unto this > place.\\" Shochat fell in love with the beauty of the land and was especially touched by the plight of the Jewish settlement in the Hauran. Baron Edmond de Rothschild had bought land in the area, but the Ottoman government stipulated that no Jews be allowed to settle there. A small group which had disregarded the decision was evicted, so the Baron resorted to leasing out the plots of land to Arab Fellahin. Shochat decided to visit all of the Baron's colonies and see for herself why they were in financial straits. She became acquainted with and was greatly impressed by Yehoshua and Olga Hankin. Her decision to stay was due in a large part to their influence. = Family = In May 1908, Manya married Israel Shochat, who was 9 years younger than her. She had 2 children with him: Gideon (Geda) and Ana. Gideon Shochat was a pilot in the British Royal Air Force (RAF) during World War II and later became one of the founding pilots of the Israeli Air Force, rising to the rank of Colonel. He committed suicide in 1967. In 1971, his daughter Alona married Arik Einstein, a famous Israeli performer. They had 2 daughters together. They later divorced, the daughters remaining with their mother. They later became Orthodox Jews, and the daughters married Uri Zohar's sons. Zohar was a good friend of Einstein and became one of the leading figures in the Orthodox community. =In Palestine= As a result of her first visit, Shochat reached a conclusion which anticipated that of Arthur Ruppin. She understood that the model of plantation settlement, favored by Baron Rothschild, where Jewish owners employed Arab workers and were subject to economic overseers, could never be the basis for Jewish national life. It led to financial difficulties and disaffection. She concluded that only collective agricultural settlement could produce Jewish workers and farmers who would be the basis for building a Jewish homeland. Her first priority was finding a solution for the problem in Hauran. Shochat left for Paris in order to research the feasibility of her ideas and then to convince the Baron to back them. In 1905, a fresh wave of pogroms swept the Russian Empire. Meir Cohen, an old friend from Minsk, came to Paris seeking the aid of the Jewish community to buy arms so they could defend themselves. Shochat laid aside the Hauran project and put her efforts towards fundraising instead. She convinced Rothschild to donate 50 000 gold francs to that end. Guns and ammunition were bought in Liege and smuggled into Russia. In order to deliver the final consignment, Shochat disguised herself as a young rabbanit from Frankfurt, bringing eight cases of scriptures, a gift for the yeshivot of Ukraine. In Odessa, an undercover police agent gained access to her apartment and discovered where the guns were. Shochat, who had a silenced pistol, shot him before he could get out and report his findings. The guns were successfully delivered to the Jewish underground. Not one was lost. Shochat returned to Palestine in 1906 to further pursue her Hauran plan. Towards the end of the year, she travelled to the United States to raise funds for that and for arms for Russian Jews. The idea of collective settlements in general, and the Hauran scheme in particular, received no support. She realised that the only way to convince people that it could work was by putting it into practice, so she returned to Palestine in 1907. Shochat shared her idea with members of \\"Poalei Tzion\\" and \\"Hapoel Hatzair\\". Hankin convinced Eliahu Krauze to give them stewardship over a failing agricultural experiment in Sejera for a year.A Voice Called: Stories of Jewish Heroism, Yossi Katz A group of eighteen young men and women, mainly friends of Israel Shochat, went on to establish the first ideological cooperative. The project succeeded and lent credence to the idea of collectives. In 1908, with Israel Shochat, she helped found the HaShomer, a guard organization, which evolved into the basis of Jewish self-defense. Its goal was to put the responsibility of guarding settlements in Jewish hands.The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History, Paul R. Mendes-Flohr and Jehuda Reinharz She married Israel Shochat in May 1908 and had two children with him. During World War I, the Turks deported the Shochats and others who were Russian nationals to Bursa, in Turkey. They returned around Passover, 1919, after attending the Poalei Tziyon convention in Stockholm. In 1921 she was in Tel-Aviv when riots broke out among the Arabs, who then attacked Jewish settlements. Along with other Hashomer members, she took part in the defence of the city. At great risk, she would walk around, disguised as a Red Cross nurse, to keep an eye out on developments. Her experience in Russia came in handy as they attempted to smuggle in grenades for the defenders of Petah-Tikva. She hid them among baskets of vegetables and eggs. The car they were in got mired just outside the town. A patrol of Indian cavalry approached. Their role was to search all travellers for arms. With great presence of mind, Manya averted disaster. She ran up to the patrol, begging them to help rescue the car from the mud. While they were pulling it out, she watched the baskets, saying that she didn't want the eggs to break. The cavalry then even provided an escort until they got into town. After the riots were over, she travelled the United States to raise funds for the defence efforts. Due to a series of differences of opinion between her and Pinhas Rutenberg, the transfer of funds was frozen and the two didn't speak for years. However, she did manage to send several thousand dollars to her husband who was waiting in Vienna, earmarked for the purchase of weapons for the Haganah. Israel Shochat oversaw the procurement and shipment of the weapons to Palestine. Manya and Israel Shochat were active in the Gdud HaAvoda (lit.: the \\"Work Battalion\\") and clandestine immigration, as well as arms-smuggling. In 1930, Manya Shochat was among the founders of the League for Arab-Jewish Friendship. In 1948 she joined the Mapam party. Literary and cultural references Mania Shochat's life is the subject of a novel by Israeli author Dvora Omer. Manya Shochat is a main character in Amos Gitai's 2003 film, Berlin Jerusalem.

Salomon de Brosse (1571 - 9 December 1626) was an influential early 17th-century French architect, a major influence on Fran√ßois Mansart. Salomon was born in Verneuil-en-Halatte, Oise, into a prominent Huguenot family, the grandson through his mother of the designer Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau and the son of the architect Jean de Brosse. He was established in practice in Paris in 1598 and was promoted to court architect in 1608. De Brosse greatly influenced the sober and classicizing direction that French Baroque architecture was to take, especially in designing his most prominent commission, the Luxembourg Palace, Paris (1615-1624), for Marie de' Medici, whose patronage had been extended to his uncle. Salomon de Brosse simplified the crowded compositions of his Androuet du Cerceau heritage and contemporary practice, ranging the U-shaped block round an entrance court, as Carlo Maderno was doing at Palazzo Barberini, Rome, about the same time. The impetus for the plan is often traced to Palazzo Pitti, Florence, where the Medici queen had spent her youth, but the formal plan of Anet could also be adduced. He clad the building wholly in stone, avoiding the lively contrast of brick and stone that was the more familiar idiom. Though de Brosse was forced to relinquish his post on 24 March 1624, construction of the Luxembourg proceeded according to his plan and elevations; extensions made in the nineteenth century have not obscured his external elements. The Parlement de Bretagne, Rennes (1618) Other buildings that he designed include: *the ch√¢teau de Montceaux-en-Brie * the ch√¢teau of Coulommiers-en-Brie (1612‚Äì15), for Catherine Gonzaga, duchesse de Longueville. * the facade of the Church of Saint-Gervais, Paris (1615-1621) * the Luxembourg Palace, Paris (1615-1624) * the Parlement de Bretagne Rennes (1618) (now a ) * the aqueduct of Arcueil (1624) * the ch√¢teau of Bl√©rancourt (ca 1619) De Brosse died, aged 55, in Paris.

The two Colleges operated as distance learning institutions and offered programs for formal diplomas, degrees and postgraduate qualifications to adults studying part-time in the fields of teacher education, business administration and policing. Education Facilitators had agreements with various higher education institutions including the University of Port Elizabeth (name has changed to the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University) and the Technikon Pretoria (name has changed to the Tswane University of Technology), which provided for the offering of their qualifications on the group's distance learning infrastructure. In addition to the above, Education Facilitators also obtained recognition from various education authorities namely, the Department of Education in South Africa, the Ministry of Education in Zambia, the SERTEC (Certification Council for Technikon Education) in South Africa, and its Colleges was accredited by the Accrediting Commission of the (DETC) Distance Education and Training Council in Washington DC, USA. This enabled the group to develop their own certificate, diploma and degree qualifications, such as Associate, Bachelor of Commerce, Bachelor of Business Administration and Master of Business Administration programs. At its peak, the group had approximately 28,000 registered students throughout southern and central Africa, awarded more than 20,000 certificates, diplomas and degrees and employed 250 plus full and part- time employees. Business Overview of Education Facilitators Education Facilitators was established in 1994 after a buy-out of the shareholders in Norite Education and Training Company. Initially, Education Facilitators offered education programs through distance learning for the upgrading of unqualified and under qualified in-service teachers, which was based on the curriculum and syllabi of the teacher training programs offered by the DET (the former Department of Education and Training) at Colleges of Education throughout South Africa. Education Facilitators had its Head Office in Johannesburg and was registered by order of the court in terms of the Higher Education Act, 1997 (Act No 101 of 1997). During 1996 Education Facilitators entered into agreements with the University of Port Elizabeth (name has changed to the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University) and the Technikon Pretoria (name has changed to the Tswane University of Technology). The programs offered by the two Colleges in collaboration with these two institutions through distance learning were examined and certified by these institutions. In addition, the programs offered by the Colleges for Technikon qualifications, were examined and inspected by the SERTEC (Certification Council for Technikon Education), which was a statutory body. Certification by these examining bodies meant that all instructional programmes complied with the norms and standards of education prescribed by the SERTEC and the Department of Education. All certificates issued by the former Technikon Pretoria to students of the Colleges were therefore issued in conjunction with SERTEC. Furthermore, all certificates awarded were recognised externally for employment, promotion and further education purposes. The increase in student numbers compelled the operating company of the Colleges to establish a Professional Services division. Since 1999 the professional services division was gradually upgraded from a position where personnel and student support was dealt with by an integrated HR, IR, Finance, ICT and logistics back office with a clearly defined value chain and service-level agreements. Very little changes occurred in the marketing procedures of the Colleges. Advertisements were placed in selected magazines and newspapers and student advisors travelled from region to region to counsel and register new students. Thereafter, the Professional Services division dealt with telephone enquiries, as well as applications that were received via either traditional or electronic methods. The group's commitment to responding positively to the education needs of the peoples of Africa, and to provide quality programs and excellent service in the fields of education, business administration and policing that assisted learners to develop the necessary skills and competency to enhance their careers were evident in the growing numbers of successful graduates. The Colleges also acknowledged that it had a positive role to play in enhancing the establishment and maintenance of a prosperous and self- sufficient democratic society in the countries that it operated in. Brief History of Education Facilitators 1990 The Norite Education and Training Company started in Johannesburg with the development of distance learning programmes from the curriculum and syllabi of the Colleges of Education that the DET.

Playing career After playing junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey Association for the Toronto St. Michael's Majors from 1959 to 1962 and the Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons from 1962 to 1963, Corbett made his professional debut with the Sudbury Wolves of the Eastern Professional Hockey League in 1962. His participation in the league however was short-lived as the EPHL folded following the season's conclusion, forcing Corbett to look elsewhere to play. Eventually, he signed with the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League whilst also splitting the 1963‚Äì1964 season with the Denver Invaders of the Western Hockey League. In 1964, Corbett joined the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Professional Hockey League and spent the entire 1964‚Äì1965 season with the team. After that, he split the next season with three different teams, the AHL's Baltimore Clippers, the CPHL's Minnesota Rangers and the WHL's Victoria Maple Leafs during their playoff run. He then had short spells in the AHL with the Providence Reds and the Springfield Indians, playing five games with each team, before joining the Vancouver Canucks of the WHL. Corbett would play in 70 regular season games for the Canucks, scoring 17 goals and 21 assists, for 38 points. Despite this, the Canucks finished last the standings and missed the playoffs. Following this, the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League offered him a spot in their playoff roster and Corbett played in two games for the Kings during their 1968 Stanley Cup playoff quarter-final against the Minnesota North Stars, which they lost four games to three. Corbett notched up one assist and two penalty minutes in the two games he played. After his brief NHL run came to an end, Corbett played one more season in the professional minor leagues, splitting the year in the International Hockey League with the Dayton Gems as well as back in the AHL with the Springfield Kings before finishing his career playing senior hockey level in the OHA Senior A League. He played for Galt Hornets, Oakville Oaks, Orillia Terriers and the Brantford Foresters from 1969 to 1974. After retiring from playing hockey in 1974, Corbett became an usher at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario. He died of cancer at the age of 60, on January 9, 2003, in Burlington, Ontario and was cremated.

Heineman and was officially adopted as the city's flag in 1948. The flag's design has been slightly altered several times in the years since, the most recent in 2000. Design The flag has the city seal emblazoned on quartered background, with each section representing a country that once controlled Detroit. The lower hoist (left) quarter represents France, which founded the fort and settlement in 1701; it has five gold fleurs-de-lis on a white field, imitating the Royal Standard of France. The upper fly (right) quarter represents Great Britain, which controlled the fort from 1760 to 1796; it has three gold lions on a red field, imitating the Royal Arms of England. The lower fly has 13 red and white stripes and the upper hoist has 13 white stars on a blue field, representing the original thirteen colonies of the United States. Symbolism The two Latin mottos read and , meaning \\"We hope for better things\\" and \\"It will rise from the ashes\\", which was written by Gabriel Richard after the fire of 1805. The seal is a representation of the Detroit fire which occurred on June 11, 1805. The fire caused the entire city to burn with only one building saved from the flames. The figure on the left weeps over the destruction while the figure on the right gestures to the new city that will rise in its place. History In the original design of the flag, the seal was oval. In the early 1970s, the flag was redesigned and the seal was changed to a circle. In 1976, the colors were standardized using the Pantone Matching System, and in approximately 2000, the seal was again changed to reduce the number of colors. \\"Detroit Rise\\" Flag Proposal Detroit Rise flag In 2019, a graphic designer from Detroit named Deon Mixon Jr.https://deonmixon.com/about.html designed a proposal for a new flag for Detroit, which he referred to as the \\"Detroit Rise\\" flag. The black represents resilience, as well as representing the \\"...strength, grit, attitude, resourcefulness, and our ability to bounce back.https://www.detroitriseflag.com/symbolism\\" The white stripe represents righteousness, and curves to represent both the city and the Detroit River (the name \\"Detroit\\" is derived from the French word le d√©troit, meaning \\"the strait\\".

Sir Horatio (Horace) Mann, 2nd Baronet (2 February 1744 ‚Äì 2 April 1814) was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1774 and 1807. He is remembered as a member of the Hambledon Club in Hampshire and a patron of Kent cricket. He was an occasional player but rarely in first-class matches. Early life Mann was the only surviving son of Galfridus Mann, an army clothier, of Boughton Place in Boughton Malherbe, Kent and his wife Sarah Gregory, daughter of John Gregory of London. He was educated at Charterhouse School and entered Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1760. His father died on 21 December 1756 and he succeeded to his estates at Boughton and Linton. He also inherited over ¬£100,000 from his father. Mann married Lady Lucy Noel, daughter of Baptist Noel, 4th Earl of Gainsborough, on 13 April 1765. Cricket Bourne Park House Mann had a number of influential friends including John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, with whom he shared a keen cricketing rivalry. He owned Boughton Place in Boughton Malherbe and Linton Park in Linton, both near Maidstone, and later had his family seat at Bourne Park House, near Canterbury. Within its grounds he had his own cricket ground Bourne Paddock which staged many first-class matches in the 1770s and 1780s. He later moved to Dandelion, near Margate, and established another ground there which was used for some first-class games towards the end of the 18th century. Mann was a member of the Committee of Noblemen and Gentlemen of Kent, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex and London. He was a member of the committee at The Star and Garter in Pall Mall, which drew up a new revision of the Laws of Cricket on 25 February 1774.Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 1 (1744‚Äì1826) p.16, Lillywhite, 1862 Political career Mann was nephew of Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet who was a British diplomat in Tuscany from 1738 to 1786. He was knighted on 10 June 1772, to act as proxy for his uncle at the installation of the Bath. Mann's ownership of Linton gave him electoral interest at Maidstone. At the 1774 general election he contested Maidstone, having deferred a planned journey abroad for his wife's health. He topped the poll and was returned as Member of Parliament for the seat. In 1775 his uncle made over to him the family estate at Bourne, in return for an annuity. He did go abroad and after visiting France, Tuscany, and Austria, returned to England in November 1778. From then on he travelled to his uncle in Florence nearly every summer. At the 1780 general election he was again returned for Maidstone at the head of the poll. He joined Brooks in 1780, and was a member of the St. Alban's Tavern group of country gentlemen who tried to reconcile Fox and Pitt. He did not stand in the 1784 general election. Mann was in Florence when his uncle died on 6 November 1786 and succeeded to the baronetcy as second baronet. He acted as charg√© d'affaires in Florence for six months. He was angered by the poor recompense he received for his services and returned to Italy in 1788 ostensibly to sort out the financial problems which resulted from running his uncle's establishment. Mann joined the Whig Club in January 1790 and at the following 1790 general election was elected in a contest as MP for Sandwich. He was returned unopposed in 1796 and 1802. By this time he was becoming increasingly absent in parliament mainly through ill-health when gout struck him. He avoided a contest and was returned in the 1806 general election, but was defeated in 1807. Later life and legacy Mann was described by Samuel Egerton Brydges as a wild, fickle, rattling man, who made no impression. In 1811 it was said that his estate would have been the largest in Kent but by his extravagance he reduced his income to not more than ¬£4,000 a year. He died on 2 April 1814. He had three daughters, but no son and the baronetcy became extinct. His property went to his nephew James Cornwallis. Cornwallis's father wrote soon after \\"My son has had a great deal of trouble in consequence of succeeding a person really ruined. The sums Sir Horace expended are beyond all belief, or rather squandered.\\" Mann is variously called Sir Horatio and Sir Horace in the sources. Horace was used as a diminutive of Horatio so both names can be regarded as correct usage. He was always called Horace in Scores and Biographies, the main source for his cricketing activities.

Preparations for war  Argentina had eight complete infantry brigades: 4th Airborne Infantry Brigade in C√≥rdoba; 5th Mountain Brigade in Tucum√°n; 9th Brigade in the Santa Cruz Province close to the Falklands; the well-equipped 6th and 8th Mountain Infantry Brigades along the Chilean border; 11th Brigade, (cold-adapted) in the extreme south; and 3rd (Jungle) and 7th (Jungle) Brigades facing Brazil and Uruguay. The Argentine Army also had the 10th Mechanized Infantry Brigade in the capital guarding against a theoretical seaborne invasion along the Buenos Aires coastline. Two assumptions governed the deployment of the Argentine ground forces on the islands (): *the junta did not believe that the British would use military force to retake the islands, so the initial landing force had been withdrawn shortly after April 3, and was not reinforced until after the British recaptured South Georgia. The intent was to place a large number of troops onto the islands to dissuade the British from any military action. As the Royal Navy had submarines patrolling the immediate area, reinforcements had to be airlifted in, which limited the heavy equipment that could be deployed. *an attack was feared from Chile due to the ongoing Beagle Channel dispute. As Chile was marshalling troops close to its Southern Argentine border, the Argentinian High Command had to deploy their better trained forces to deter a Chilean attack. As a result, neither the mountain warfare regiments, nor the paratroop brigade were available. Furthermore, only a fifth of the cold-adapted marine infantry was sent to the islands. The majority of the troops deployed were from sub- tropical areas, the Argentine Mesopotamia region and Buenos Aires Province, and not trained for action in the terrain (they were trained to avoid snakes and sunstroke, not frostbite). These two incorrect assumptions led to inappropriate troops being sent to the islands.Commodore Ruben Oscar Moro La Guerra Inaudita, 2000 In the Argentine Army, the bulk of the national servicemen were demobilized in late December. The Soldados Clase ‚Äô63 (SC 63) were conscripts born in 1963. On April 2, 1982 the SC 63 inducted into the army in February had started their 45 days of boot camp training. When the Royal Navy set sail for the South Atlantic, the army tried to replace their SC 63 intake with the recently demobilized SC '62 reservists.Martin Middlebrook: \\"The Argentine fight for the Malvinas - The Argentine Forces in the Falklands War\\", Pen and Sword Books, 1989, , p. 51: Every Argentine young man became liable for a twelve-month period of military service in the year that he celebrated his 19th birthday. The military year in Argentina began in January when the regiments received the young conscripts. During the year, the recruits were trained and released in the last months of that annum. Soldados Clase ‚Äô63 were conscripts born in 1963. It was possible to wait up to seven years for military service, so Soldados Clase ‚Äô59 in 1982 were both lingering conscripts and recalled reservists. Since SC ‚Äô63 only had four months of training, the army tried to replace them with SC ‚Äô62 reservists; two-thirds had been changed by the time the British arrived. The conscripts inducted in February and March 1982 in Lieutenant-Colonel Mohamed Al√≠ Seineld√≠n's 25th Infantry Regiment from the 9th Infantry Brigade in Santa Cruz Province, received Commando training in a crash 4-week course. British Warrant Officer Nick Van Der Bijl, who interviewed key captured Argentine officers in the fighting has written: In all, some fifty conscripts in the 12th Regiment from the 3rd Infantry Brigade in Corrientes Province had also been put through a compressed commando course organized by visiting Argentine Army Green Berets in 1981. Private Esteban Roberto √Åvalos who fought in the Falklands as a sniper recalls: During 1981, a Commando course was squeezed in the 10th Mechanised Infantry Brigade in Buenos Aires. The brigade commander, Brigadier Oscar Luis Jofr√© had decided that an airlanding special operations platoon would be formed for each of his regiments. Major Oscar Ram√≥n Jaimet, the Operations Officer of the 6th Regiment, took over command of the formation of these helicopter-borne platoons of mainly conscripts. Jaimet, a dedicated professional soldier had served behind Marxist separatist guerrilla lines as a Commando in the Tucum√°n Province in 1975. Private Santiago Fabi√°n Gauto was selected to be part of the Commando platoon for the 7th Regiment: Major Carlos Carrizo Salvadores, second-in-command of the 7th Regiment confirms that:  Theatre of Operations in the Falkland Islands (April 7 ‚Äì June 14)  Guarnici√≥n Militar Malvinas * Commander: Brigade General Mario Men√©ndez (governor). RI (Infantry Regiments) were about 800 men. = 3rd (Jungle) Infantry Brigade = It was on 2 April 1982 when Brigadier-General Omar Edgardo Parada learned that the Falklands/Malvinas had been occupied. This brigade commander did not have much time to take part in the official celebrations held in the capital city of Corrientes Province; he soon received orders to prepare his brigade for transfer to southern Argentina, with one of his units, the 3rd Artillery Regiment ordered to Port Stanley. At this juncture most of the 3rd Brigade conscripts had completed their national service and had returned to civilian life, and the new batch of conscripts had just been incorporated. Parada immediately went about the task of rounding up all the reservists, which he was able to achieve in great numbers by sending messengers in vehicles. Thus a substantial part of the trained reservists from the provinces of Corrientes, Chaco, and Misiones, were mobilized, many of the recalled soldiers scrambling aboard the trains laden with the brigade's regulars on their southbound journey. After crossing the Colorado River, Parada received new instructions to reinforce Brigadier-General Am√©rico Daher's 9th Infantry Brigade in Santa Cruz Province that had already sent the 8th and 25th Regiments to the Falklands. Before this request could be met, the 3rd Brigade received orders to board the transport planes heading to Port Stanley.It was only then that Brigadier General Parada learned the Malvinas had been reclaimed. This brigade commander did not have much time to concern himself with bedecking the city with flags or even to celebrate the event; he soon received official orders to prepare his brigade for transfer to the south, and one of his units, the 3rd Artillery Group, to be sent to the theater of operations on the Malvinas. At this juncture most of the draftees of the contingent born in 1962 had completed their service and had been mustered out, and the 1963 contingent had just been sworn in. He immediately went about the task of rounding up all the \\"veterans,\\" which he was able to achieve in large numbers by sending messengers in all directions. Thus the all-too-recently demobilized conscripts from Corrientes, from the Chaco, from Misiones, from all over the country were once again herded front and center, many of them scrambling aboard trains laden with the brigade's regulars on their southbound trek. As they rumbled across the Colorado River, the 3rd Brigade had not mustered its full strength, but it had already accomplished its primary mission: a dragnet had brought in able bodied men along the coast of Patagonia. While this was going on, it received a new assignment: reinforce the 9th Brigade in Santa Cruz Province. Before this latest mission was accomplished, it was burdened with yet a third: ship out to the Malvinas Islands.

Private Dacio Agretti, serving in B Company from the 4th Infantry Regiment, recalls events leading up to the Battle of Two Sisters: During the Battle of Mount Harriet, 42 Commando Group discovered a path through a frozen minefield, according to the 4th Regiment's Intelligence Officer First Lieutenant Jorge Echeverr√≠a,Evidentemente fue una infiltraci√≥n grand√≠sima. Por los informes que tengo hasta ahora no puedo precisar exactamente el punto por donde entraron, pero s√≠ s√© que entraron por el flanco que ten√≠amos totalmente cubierto, que era el de la costa que iba para Puerto Argentino. Lo ten√≠amos- minado, ese campo minado cost√≥ mucho tiempo, cost√≥ sudor, cost√≥ bajas, y se pusieron esas minas que pesan veinte kilos. Lo que pasa es que es como todo.

T√∫rolo, p. 144, Editorial Subamericana, 1982 allowing the Royal Marines to attack the two Argentine 4th Regiment companies on Harriet from the rear. The British marines were in among the 120mm heavy mortar platoon (under Second Lieutenant Mario Hector Ju√°rez) and 12th Regiment reserve platoon (under Second Lieutenant Celestino Mosteirin) positions very early in the battle, and they took the position after a 15-minute gun-fight and scattered the defenders. The 12th Regiment company commander present, First Lieutenant Ignacio Gorriti and First Lieutenant Jorge Echeverr√≠a tried to pull troops from Mosteirin's reinforced rifle platoon to counterattack the British, but many of the soldiers initially refused to obey any commands to stand and fight. A 4th Regiment B Company platoon commander, Second Lieutenant Eugenio C√©sar Bruny, managed to pull together his rifle platoon for a counterattack but it was pinned and dispersed almost immediately by British artillery and mortar fire.In the last attack of the night, the British 42nd Commando Battalion found a way through an undefended minefield, allowing them to attack the two Argentine companies on Mt. Harriet from the rear. The British soldiers were in among the Argentine reserves, headquarters, and mortar positions before the fight ever began, and they took the position and quickly scattered the defenders. Several Argentine junior officers tried to pull troops from the front lines to counterattack the British in the rear, but many of their soldiers panicked and fled, while others simply refused to obey any commands to fight or move. One officer managed to pull together a platoon for a counterattack but it was pinned and dispersed almost immediately by British artillery and mortar fire. Kenneth M.

Description The Excelsior Geyser pool discharges 4,000 to 4,500 gallons (15,100‚Äì17,000 l) of water per minute directly into the Firehole River. In the late 19th century (and possibly 1901), it was an active geyser that erupted frequently. Most eruptions were about 100 feet high, although some exceeded in both height and width. It is believed that the powerful eruptions damaged its internal plumbing system, and it now boils as a productive hot spring most of the time. Activity In 1985, Excelsior returned to activity for a 46-hour period from September 14 to 16. These eruptions were relatively small at but a few were as much as tall and 100 feet wide. All of these eruptions lasted about 2 minutes at intervals of 5 to 66 minutes. Between 2004 and 2006, Excelsior did have violent boiling strong enough to be considered as eruptions. This boiling reached between and had a duration of seconds. {  File:Excelsion geyser in 1890.jpgPostcard after F.

An extension of inventory control is the inventory control system. This may come in the form of a technological system and its programmed software used for managing various aspects of inventory problems , or it may refer to a methodology (which may include the use of technological barriers) for handling loss prevention in a business. Inventory control systems Wireless barcode reader with docking stationAn inventory control system is used to keep inventories in a desired state while continuing to adequately supply customers, and its success depends on maintaining clear records on a periodic or perpetual basis. Inventory management software often plays an important role in the modern inventory control system, providing timely and accurate analytical, optimization, and forecasting techniques for complex inventory management problems. Typical features of this type of software include: * inventory tracking and forecasting tools that use selectable algorithms and review cycles to identify anomalies and other areas of concern * inventory optimization * purchase and replenishment tools that include automated and manual replenishment components, inventory calculations, and lot size optimization * lead time variability management * safety stock calculation and forecasting * inventory cost management * shelf-life and slow-mover logic * multiple location support * Mobile/Moving Inventory Support Through this functionality, a business may better detail what has sold, how quickly, and at what price, for example. Reports could be used to predict when to stock up on extra products around a holiday or to make decisions about special offers, discontinuing products, and so on. Inventory control techniques often rely upon barcodes and radio- frequency identification (RFID) tags to provide automatic identification of inventory objects‚Äîincluding but not limited to merchandise, consumables, fixed assets, circulating tools, library books, and capital equipment‚Äîwhich in turn can be processed with inventory management software. A new trend in inventory management is to label inventory and assets with a QR Code, which can then be read with smart-phones to keep track of inventory count and movement. These new systems are especially useful for field service operations, where an employee needs to record inventory transaction or look up inventory stock in the field, away from the computers and hand-held scanners. Advantages and disadvantages Inventory control systems have advantages and disadvantages, based on what style of system is being run. A purely periodic (physical) inventory control system takes \\"an actual physical count and valuation of all inventory on hand ... at the close of an accounting period,\\" whereas a perpetual inventory control system takes an initial count of an entire inventory and then closely monitors any additions and deletions as they occur. Various advantages and disadvantages, in comparison, include: * Periodic is technically the more accurate as it considers both counted and valued inventory. * Periodic is more time-consuming than perpetual. * Perpetual can lower the cost of carrying inventory vs. periodic. * Perpetual is typically more costly to run than periodic. * Perpetual needs to be verified from time to time against an actual physical count, due to scrap, human error, theft, and other variables.  Inventory Control vs. Inventory Management  While it is sometimes used interchangeably, inventory management and inventory control deal with different aspects of inventory. Inventory management involves tracking inventory throughout the supply chain, from sourcing to order fulfilment. Inventory control is the process of managing stock once it arrives at a warehouse, store or other storage location. It involves planning for sales and stock-outs, optimizing inventory for maximum benefit and preventing the pile-up of dead stock.

In 1994 he was the World Road Champion. Biography In 1978, a drunk driver hit Luc Leblanc, aged 11, and his younger brother Gilles Leblanc, aged 8. Gilles died after the accident, while Luc had to stay in the hospital for six months. After many operations, Luc could walk again, although his left leg was 3 cm shorter than his right leg, and also weaker. Initially, Leblanc wanted to become a priest, but after a physiotherapist's advice to take up cycling to solve his leg problems, and subsequently Raymond Poulidor's advice to become a professional cyclist, he did not become a priest. At the 1991 Tour de France, in the 12th stage Leblanc joined the decisive attack together with Charly Mottet and Pascal Richard. Mottet won the stage, but they finished 7 minutes ahead of the classification leader LeMond, which meant that Leblanc was the new leader. The next day, Leblanc finished 12 minutes behind the winner, and lost the lead to Miguel Indurain, who would remain the leader until the end of the race. The yellow jersey that he received for leading the general classification, he gave to Poulidor. His accident years earlier did lead to operations on his injuries, and in the 1992 Tour de France the effects caught up with him and he had to stop on the stage to Alpe d'Huez. Again, in 1993, his legs hurt, nothing worked, and Luc Leblanc wanted to end his cycling career. However, the last thing he decided to try was to switch to teams and he joined the Festina team. The next year, 1994, was his most successful year. At Festina, Leblanc won the 11th stage of the 1994 Tour de France ahead of Pantani and Indurain, and in the 1994 Vuelta a Espa√±a he won the mountains classification. Later that year he won the 1994 UCI Road World Championships. As a world champion, Leblanc had many offers from the world's best cycling teams. He joined Le Groupement, but the team's sponsorship ended one week before the 1995 Tour de France. Leblanc moved on to the Italian team Polti. Here, needing operations on his leg again, the results were not as expected, although he won one stage at the 1996 Tour de France. In 1999, Leblanc was fired by Polti, because Leblanc was injured and could not continue his career. Later, the Italian court decided that the dismissal was unfair, and Polti should pay Leblanc. In 2007, Leblanc sued the French and Italian cycling authorities and the UCI because he still had not gotten the money. In 2004, Leblanc became team captain for Chocolade Jacques in 2004. Later, Leblanc became a consultant for a French radio station Radio Monte Carlo during the Tour de France.  Doping  After his retirement, in a trial against Richard Virenque in 2000, Leblanc admitted that he had been using EPO to prepare for the Tour and the Vuelta.

Armstrong was born in McMinnville, Tennessee, son of Dr. John B. Armstrong and Maria Susannah Ready on January 1, 1850. Among notable relatives were his maternal grandfather Charles Ready, a U.S. Representative from Tennessee and his cousin Confederate States Army Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan. After living in Arkansas and Missouri for a short time, Armstrong moved to Austin, Texas in 1871. After a short experience as a lawman, in 1875 he joined the Special Force under Captain Leander H. McNelly, a newly created quasi-military branch of the Texas Rangers that was to operate in southern Texas. His role as McNelly's second in command and right hand earned him the promotion to sergeant and the nickname \\"McNelly's Bulldog\\". With the death of McNelly and the absorption of the Special Force within the Texas Rangers' Frontier Battalion in 1876, Armstrong was promoted to Lieutenant. He was involved in several notable cases, like the capture of Hardin and the pursuit and killing of noted bank robber Sam Bass. Armstrong resigned his position at the Rangers in 1881, and was shortly after appointed U.S. Marshal. He established in Willacy County, Texas, where he founded a considerably large ranch. He died at his home in Armstrong, Texas, on May 1, 1913. The ranch was later reorganized into Kenedy County, Texas Films The film Texas Rangers (2001) portrays the exploits of Armstrong, who is played by actor Robert Patrick.

It is in the Geyser Hill Complex which includes Aurum Geyser, Beehive Geyser, Big Cub Geyser. Doublet Pool, Giantess Geyser and Lion Geyser, among others. Pump Geyser erupts almost constantly making splashes 2 to 3 feet high, and thumps without an apparent interval, though there are less productive periods. Then, in 1990, Pump became a true geyser, with intervals and durations of a few seconds. A small boil builds up to a heavy doming of the water which triggers bursting eruptions that spray water up to 15 feet high. After a few seconds of this, the activity dies down to a mere simmer, but, after a pause of a few seconds, the cycle starts anew. It was most likely named by Frank Jay Haynes, the park photographer from 1883 to 1916. It gets its name because its constant eruptions make a sound similar to that of old style mechanical pump. It may have also been confused for a different geyser called the Pump, when the other one went extinct. Pump Geyser could have a connection with Sponge Geyser, but it has not been proven. While Sponge fills up, Pump is strangely quiet. Then, when Sponge drains, after a few seconds, Pump begins spurting again. Although a connection is very likely, it has not been further studied.

Created by Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the pages of Mister Miracle during the early 1970s. He is popularly considered a satiric caricature of Stan Lee, Kirby's former artistic collaborator at Marvel Comics with whom he had a falling-out. Flashman's attempts to rip off Mister Miracle reflect Kirby's view that Lee exploited his work at Marvel in the 1960s. Fictional character biography Nothing is known about Funky's past except that he and his sidekick Houseroy (popularly considered to be a caricature of Roy Thomas)Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and the American Comic Book Revolution by Ronin Ro; published by Bloomsbury Publishing, 2008 (via Google Books) were business associates of a Colonel Mockingbird. After Mockingbird's death, Funky and Houseroy lived on monthly allowances (most likely their inheritance from Mockingbird) that were automatically doled out. Noticing that the monthly allowances were getting smaller, Funky decided that he needed a new source of income. In Funky Flashman's first appearance, he unsuccessfully attempts to cash in on the talents of Mister Miracle. Donning a wig and a beard, he meets with Mr. Miracle to interview for the position of his tour manager. Miracle accepts, despite the fact that Big Barda and Oberon object to Flashman's demeanor and tactics. The next day, Mr. Miracle performs several of his escape acts, much to Flashman's delight. Flashman asks for Miracle's secret, and Miracle reveals the mother box he keeps on his shoulder. From around the corner, the two men see Big Barda and the Female Fury Lashina engaged in a struggle. Miracle jumps in to help Barda but Lashina vanishes with the power of her phasing circuits. The two realize the Female Furies have been tracking their whereabouts through the mother box signal. During the skirmish, Flashman decides to leave with the mother box in hand. He takes it back to his residence but cannot make heads or tails of it. He discards the box and decides the gift of Mr. Miracle is too risky. Mother box begins to let out an \\"eeeeee\\" sound which summons all the Female Furies of Apokolips. Funky cowardly tosses his assistant at the attackers and jumps out the window. His inherited house explodes behind him, and Funky Flashman walks off to live another day.Jack Kirby's Fourth World Omnibus, Volume 3, DC Comics, November 2007.

Both sides (left = obverse; right = reverse) depict a draped bust of Aphrodite Nicocreon (Greek NŒπŒ∫oŒ∫œÅŒ≠œâŒΩ; lived 4th century BC) was king of Salamis in Cyprus, at the time of Alexander the Great's (336-323 BC) expedition against Persia. Nicocreon submitted to the conqueror along with the other Cypriot kings, without opposition. In 331 BC, after the return of Alexander from Egypt, Nicocreon visited the city of Tyre to pay homage to him, where he distinguished himself by the magnificence which he displayed in furnishing his theatrical exhibitions. After the death of Alexander, Nicocreon allied with Ptolemy against Antigonus, and in 315 BC, he colluded with Seleucus and Menelaus, two of Ptolemy's generals, in neutralizing the Cypriot city-kingdoms which had supported Antigonus. In return for these services, Ptolemy awarded him personal command of Citium, Lapithos, Keryneia, and Marion, in addition to retaining Salamis. He was also entrusted with the chief command over the whole island of Cyprus. Nothing is known of the fortunes of Nicocreon after this. As there is no mention of his name during the memorable siege of Salamis by Demetrius Poliorcetes (306 BC), or the great sea-fight that followed it, it seems probable that he must have died before those events. One personal anecdote recorded about Nicocreon is his putting to death in a barbarous manner the philosopher Anaxarchus in revenge for an insult which the latter had offered him on the occasion of his visit to Alexander.

It is located on the Lausanne campus (Switzerland). The Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC, French: Institut suisse de recherche exp√©rimentale sur le cancer) is a not-for-profit institution founded in 1964 and located in √âpalinges, Switzerland. Since 1 January 1, 2008, it is organized into two distinct entities: * The ISREC Foundation whose mission is to continue to seek and provide resources for the support of translational cancer research projects and the training of young scientists. * The Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC), at the School of Life Sciences of the EPFL, whose research projects are oriented towards fundamental cancer research.  History  The ISREC has its origins in the history of the Centre anti-canc√©reux romand (CACR) which was founded in 1924 in Lausanne. Initially, the CACR was composed of three main departments: pathology, experimental research and a therapeutic service. The appointment of Alfredo Vannotti (1907‚Äì2002) as Head of the experimental research service in 1947 and the appointment one year later of Serge Neukomm (born 1917), led to the development of experimental research. In the 1950s, the medico-social activities were maintained, but in 1957, they were taken up by the cantonal leagues. The CACR then limited its activities to experimental research on cancer. Under the leadership of Rudolf Stadler (Chairman since 1951) and Henri Isliker (Director), ISREC was created on June 18, 1964 as a Swiss foundation. Initially, the ISREC was situated next to the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV). The ISREC was growing steadily. In 1970, the collaboration of the ISREC with the Institute of Biochemistry of the University of Lausanne, the WHO Immunology Research and Training Centre and the Lausanne branch of Ludwig Cancer Research constituted a critical mass of over 150 scientists. The space in the building on the rue du Bugnon became totally inadequate. The ISREC built a new research center in Epalinges and moved there in autumn 1976. In 1978, Henri Isliker handed the direction of ISREC to Bernhard Hirt who headed the Institute for 18 years. In 1996, Michel Aguet took over as director. In 2008, the research groups of the Institute were integrated into the EPFL ‚Äì School of Life Sciences and in 2009, Douglas Hanahan was nominated director of the Institute. The ISREC Foundation (President Yves J. Paternot) continues to seek and to provide resources to support projects having a broad potential of diagnostic or therapeutic innovation in cancer research.  Research  The Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research has, for over 40 years of its existence as an independent institute, been devoted to cancer related basic research. Since its integration as an institute into the EPFL School of Life Sciences on January 1, 2008 and the renewal of a substantial part of its scientific staff, its research focuses on areas including genome stability, cell proliferation and differentiation, and the role of developmental pathways in tumorigenesis and tumor progression.  Publications  Between 1964 and today more than 2,000 articles were published by ISREC researchers in various scientific journals, notably in Cell, Nature and Science.  Honors (Selection)  The research conducted by ISREC members has been distinguished by major awards. These include: * Marcel Benoist Prize: ** 1976: Jean-Charles Cerottini and Theodor K.

The term Disneyisation appears in Christian Contradictions and the World Revolution (1991), by Andre Kehoe: \\"This bogus culture imposed hour after hour on the people by the media is a serious interference with free thinking and therefore free action. It is part of what Peter K. Fallon of New York University, in an admirable phrase, calls the Disneyisation of society.\\" The term also appears in The Cultures of Cities (1996), by Sharon Zukin, and was popularized in The Disneyization of Society (2004), by Alan Bryman. The Disneyfication of urban space is explored in Tearing Down the Streets: Adventures in Urban Anarchy, by Jeff Ferrell. The terms Disneyfication and Disneyisation are derogatory, implying the social and cultural homogenization consequent to consumerism, merchandising, and emotional labor; and broadly describe the processes of stripping a real place or event of its original character, and represent it in a sanitized format. References to anything negative are removed, and the facts are dumbed down with the intent of rendering the subject more pleasant and easily grasped. In the case of places, that means replacing the real with an idealized, tourist-friendly veneer reminiscent of the \\"Main Street, U.S.A.\\" attractions at Disney theme parks; the aspects of Disneyization include: * theming ‚Äì infusing a place or object with a particular idea. * hybrid consumption ‚Äì a collection of multiple consumption opportunities in a particular location. * merchandising ‚Äì promoting goods or services with objects bearing promotional images or logos. * performative labor ‚Äì making employees not only providers of services, but also entertainers. The French philosopher Jean Baudrillard (who writes about the nature of reality and the hyperreality) has called Disneyland the most real place in the U.S., because it is not pretending to be anything more than it actually is, a theme park.

With 3.7 million members, it is the largest Christian church in Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland's 2016 census, 78% of the population identified as Catholic, which represents a decrease of 6% from 2011. By contrast, 41% of Northern Ireland identified as Catholic at the 2011 census, a percentage that is expected to increase in the coming years. The Primate of All Ireland is the Archbishop of Armagh. The Primate of Ireland is the Archbishop of Dublin. The church is administered on an all-Ireland basis. The Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference is a consultative body for ordinaries in Ireland. Christianity has existed in Ireland since the 5th century and arrived from Roman Britain (most famously associated with Saint Patrick), forming what is today known as Gaelic Christianity. It gradually gained ground and replaced the old pagan traditions. The Catholic Church in Ireland cites its origin to this period and considers Palladius as the first bishop sent to the Gaels by Pope Celestine I. However, during the 12th century a stricter uniformity in the Western Church was enforced, with the diocesan structure introduced with the Synod of R√°th Breasail in 1111 and culminating with the Gregorian Reform which coincided with the Norman invasion of Ireland. After the Tudor conquest of Ireland the Catholic Church was outlawed. The English Crown attempted to export the Protestant Reformation into Ireland. In the 16th century, Irish national identity coalesced around Irish Catholicism. For several centuries, the Irish Catholic majority were suppressed, but eventually the Church and the British Empire came to a rapprochement. Funding for Maynooth College was agreed as was Catholic Emancipation to ward off revolutionary republicanism. Following the Easter Rising of 1916 and the creation of the Irish Free State, the Church gained significant social and political influence. This has seen a decline due to social liberal modernity. HistoryGaels and early Christianity= The Christianisation of Ireland is associated with the 5th century activities of St. Patrick. The Roman Empire never reached Ireland; so when the Edict of Milan in 313 AD allowed tolerance for the Levantine-originated religion of Christianity and then the Edict of Thessalonica in 380 AD enforced it as the state religion of the Empire; covering much of Europe (including Roman Britain); the indigenous Indo- European pagan traditions of the Gaels in Ireland remained normative. Aside from this independence, Gaelic Ireland was a highly decentralised tribal society, so mass conversion to a new system would prove a drawn out process. The earliest stages of Christianity in Ireland during its 5th century arrival are somewhat obscure, however, native Christian figures including Ailbe, Abb√°n, Ciar√°n and Decl√°n, later venerated as saint by the Christians, are known. These were typically in Leinster and Munster. The early stories of these people mention journeys to Roman Britain, Roman Gaul and even Rome itself. Indeed, Pope Celestine I is held to have sent Palladius to evangelise the Gaels in 431, but this did not gather much steam. However, the figure most associated with the Christianisation of Ireland is Patrick (Maewyn Succat), a Romano-British nobleman, who was captured by the Gaels during a raid, as Roman rule in Britain was retracting. Patrick contested with the dru√≠, targeted the local royalty for conversion and re-orientated Irish Christianity to having Armagh as the preeminent seat of power; an ancient royal site associated with the goddess Macha (an aspect of An Morr√≠ghan). =Gregorian Reform and Norman influence= A reform to the Roman style diocesan system developed slowly after the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111. In 1155, Pope Adrian IV, the English born Pope, issued a papal bull known as Laudabiliter. This purported to give Henry, Duke of Normandy (also known as King Henry II of England ) permission to invade Ireland as a means of strengthening the Papacy's control over the Irish Church.Austin Lane Poole. From Domesday book to Magna Carta, 1087‚Äì1216. Oxford University Press 1993. pp. 303‚Äì304. The Norman invasion of Ireland began in 1169, under the authority of this bull. Adrian IV's successor, Pope Alexander III, ratified the Laudabiliter and claimed to give Henry dominion over the \\"barbarous nation\\" of Ireland so that its \\"filthy practises\\" may be abolished, its Church brought into line, and that the Irish pay their tax to Rome.Hull, Eleanor. \\"Pope Adrian's Bull \\"Laudabiliter\\" and Note upon It\\", from A History of Ireland and Her People (1931). After the Norman invasion, a greater number of foreign-born prelates were appointed. =Counter-Reformation and suppression= St. Oliver Plunkett, Primate of All Ireland was executed by the English during the \\"Popish Plot\\" affair. A confusing but defining period arose during the English Reformation in the 16th century, with monarchs alternately for or against papal supremacy. When on the death of Queen Mary in 1558, the church in England and Ireland broke away completely from the papacy, all but two of the bishops of the church in Ireland followed the decision. Very few of the local clergy led their congregations to follow. The new body became the established state church, which was grandfathered in the possession of most church property. This allowed the Church of Ireland to retain a great repository of religious architecture and other religious items, some of which were later destroyed in subsequent wars. A substantial majority of the population remained Catholic, despite the political and economic advantages of membership in the state church. Despite its numerical minority, however, the Church of Ireland remained the official state church for almost 300 years until it was disestablished on 1 January 1871 by the Irish Church Act 1869 that was passed by Gladstone's Liberal government. The effect of the Act of Supremacy 1558 and the papal bull of 1570 (Regnans in Excelsis) legislated that the majority population of both kingdoms to be governed by an Anglican ascendancy. After the defeat of King James II of The Three Kingdoms in 1690, the Test Acts were introduced which began a long era of discrimination against the recusant Catholics of the kingdoms. =Between emancipation and the revolution= The slow process of reform from 1778 on led to Catholic Emancipation in 1829. By then Ireland was a part of the newly created United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. =Following the partition of Ireland= Mass in a Connemara Cabin by Aloysius O'Kelly, 1883. The custom of priests saying Mass secretly in people's homes dates to the penal laws-era. It was especially common in rural areas. From the time that Ireland achieved independence, the church came to play an increasingly significant social and political role in the Irish Free State and following that, the Republic of Ireland. For many decades, Catholic influence (coupled with the rural nature of Irish society) meant that Ireland was able to uphold family-orientated social policies for longer than most of the West, contrary to the laissez- faire-associated cultural liberalism of the British and Americans. This cultural direction was particularly prominent under √âamon de Valera. For example, from 1937 until 1995, divorce and remarriage was not permitted (in line with Catholic views of marriage).Divorce was permitted under the Constitution of the Irish Free State. The ban on divorce was introduced with the 1937 constitution. The ban was repealed in 1995. While the ban forbade remarriage, it provided for separation. Similarly, the importation of contraceptionThe sale of contraceptives was banned until 1978. They were regarded as medical items thereafter, and were only available from pharmacies; see . Other outlets issued them freely, accepting donations and, as this was not selling, it was legal; see Contraception in the Republic of Ireland. For comparison, some other countries had a total ban: in the United States, for example, laws in some states prohibited contraception to married couples until the Griswold v. Connecticut decision in 1965; unmarried couples had to wait until the 1972 ruling Eisenstadt v. Baird. abortion and pornography were also resisted; media-depictions perceived to be detrimental to public morality were also opposed by Catholics. In addition the church largely controlled many of the state's hospitals, and most schools, and remained the largest provider of many other social services. At the partition of Ireland in 1922, 92.6% of the south's population were Catholic while 7.4% were Protestant.M.E.Collins, Ireland 1868‚Äì1966, (1993) p431 By the 1960s, the Anglican and Protestant population had fallen by half, mostly due to emigration in the early years of Irish independence, with some Anglicans preferring to live within the UK. However, in the early 21st century the percentage of Protestants in the Republic has risen slightly, to 4.2%, and the absolute numbers to over 200,000, almost equal to the number in 1920, due to immigration and a modest flow of conversions from Catholicism. The Catholic Church's policy of Ne Temere, whereby the children of marriages between Catholics and Protestants had to be brought up as Catholics,The Ne Temere decree was issued in 1908. In one Irish instance, a court ruled, in 1957, that a pre-nuptial agreement based on this was legally binding. This led to the Fethard-on-Sea boycott. Many, including √âamon de Valera condemned the incident. Ne Temere was criticised by the Second Vatican Council and repealed by Pope Paul VI in 1970, declaring: \\"The penalties decreed by canon 2319 of the Code of Canon Law are all abrogated. For those who have already incurred them the effects of those penalties cease\\" (see ). also helped to uphold Catholic hegemony. In both parts of Ireland, church policy and practice changed markedly after the Vatican II reforms of 1962. Probably the largest change was that Mass could be said in vernacular languages instead of Latin, and in 1981 the church commissioned its first edition of the Bible in the Irish language,An Biobla Naofa, Irish Bible Society, Maynooth 1981 ed. P√°draig √ì Fiannachta. but the Church overwhelmingly uses English. Archbishop John Charles McQuaid was uneasy about the introduction of an English liturgy and ecumenical revisions, finding it offensive to Catholic sensibilities; he wished to uphold the liturgy in Latin, while also offering Irish as the vernacular (he promoted an Irish language provision more than other Bishops). Since the Celtic Tiger and the furtherance of cosmopolitanism in Ireland, Catholicism has been one of the traditional elements of Ireland to fall into decline; particularly in urban areas. Fewer than one in five Catholics attend Mass on any given Sunday in Dublin with many young people only retaining a marginal interest in religion the Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, said in May 2011. According to an Ipsos MRBI poll by the Irish Times, the majority of Irish Catholics do not attend mass weekly, with almost 62% rejecting key parts of Catholicism such as transubstantiation. After the results of both the 2015 same-sex marriage and 2018 abortion referendums, √öna Mullally, a liberal journalist who writes for The Guardian claimed that \\"the fiction of Ireland as a conservative, dogmatically Catholic country has been shattered\\". Northern Ireland The Government of Ireland Act of 1920 acted as the constitution of Northern Ireland, in which was enshrined freedom of religion for all of Northern Ireland's citizens. Here Catholics formed a minority of some 35 percent of the population, which had mostly supported Irish nationalism and was therefore historically opposed to the creation of Northern Ireland. Many commentators have suggested that the separate education systems in Northern Ireland after 1921 prolonged the sectarian divisions in that community. Cases of gerrymandering and preference in public services for Protestants led on to the need for a Civil Rights Movement in 1967. This was in response to continuing discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland.Richard English. The State: Historical and Political Dimensions, Charles Townshend, 1998, Routledge, p. 96; . Organisation Catholic Dioceses in the island of Ireland The Church is organised into four ecclesiastical provinces. While these may have coincided with contemporary 12th century civil provinces or petty kingdoms, they are not now coterminous with the modern civil provincial divisions. The church is led by four archbishops and twenty-three bishops; however, because there have been amalgamations and absorptions, there are more than twenty-seven dioceses. For instance, the diocese of Cashel has been joined with the diocese of Emly, Waterford merged with Lismore, Ardagh merged with Clonmacnoise among others. The bishop of the Diocese of Galway is also the Apostolic Administrator of Kilfenora. There are 1087 parishes, a few of which are governed by administrators, the remainder by parish priests. There are about 3000 secular clergy‚Äîparish priests, administrators, curates, chaplains, and professors in colleges. The Association of Catholic Priests is a voluntary association of clergy in Ireland that claims to have 800 members. There are also many religious orders, which include: Augustinians, Capuchins, Carmelites, Fathers of the Holy Ghost, Dominicans, Franciscans, Jesuits, Marists, Missionaries of Charity, Oblates, Passionists, Redemptorists, and Vincentians. The total number of the regular clergy is about 700. They are engaged either in teaching or in giving missions, and occasionally charged with the government of parishes. Two societies of priests were founded in Ireland, namely St Patrick's Missionary Society, with its headquarters in County Wicklow, and the Missionary Society of St. Columban based in County Meath. =Affiliated groups= Besides numerous religious institutes such as the Dominicans, there are many groups more focused on Catholic laity in Ireland, such as: *Society of Saint Vincent de Paul (1844) *Ancient Order of Hibernians (1890s) *Knights of Columbanus (1915) *Legion of Mary (1921) Other organisations with Irish branches: *Sovereign Military Order of Malta *Order of the Holy Sepulchre =Missionary activity= In the years surrounding the Great Famine in Ireland, the Catholic Church was doing much work to evangelise other nations in the world. As a consequence of the famine, the Parish Mission's Movement commenced that would lead to a stricter observance of Catholicism in Ireland as well as the push for reform of healthcare and education which would later be expanded into the overseas missionary work. Initially inspired largely by Cardinal Newman to convert the colonised peoples of the British Empire, after 1922 the church continued to work in healthcare and education what is now the Third World through its bodies such as Tr√≥caire. Along with the Irish Catholic diaspora in countries like the US and Australia, this has created a worldwide network, though affected by falling numbers of priests. Statistics In the 2016 Irish census 78.3% of the population identified as Catholic in Ireland; numbering approximately 3.7 million people. Unlike Catholics in some other countries, Ireland has seen a significant decline from the 84.2% who identified as Catholic in the 2011 census. In October 2019 the Association of Catholic Priests (ACP) announced that reform is urgently required to prevent parishes from closing across Ireland. The number of clerics dying or retiring continues to exceed the number of new priests. The ACP has long promoted church reform, including relaxing celibacy rules, ordaining married men, and ordaining women to the diaconate. irish Central, \\"Irish priests warn Catholic sacraments will disappear amid vocation crisis\\" Oct. 30, 2019 SocietyPolitics= In Ireland the church had significant influence on public opinion. The introduction of the Irish Education Act (1831) of Lord Stanley placed Irish primary school education under it. It was associated with the Jacobite movement until 1766, and with Catholic emancipation until 1829. The church was resurgent between 1829 and the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1869‚Äì71, when its most significant leaders included Bishop James Doyle, Cardinal Cullen and Archbishop MacHale. The relationship to Irish nationalism was complex; most of the bishops and high clergy supported the British Empire, but a considerable number of local priests were more sympathetic to Irish independence. While the Church hierarchy was willing to work with Parliamentary Irish nationalism, it was mostly critical of \\"Fenianism\\"; i.e. ‚Äì Irish republicanism. This continued right up until it was clear that the British-side was losing, then the Church partly switched sides. It supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and therefore were formally Pro-Treaty in the Irish Civil War, excommunicating Anti-Treaty followers. Despite this, some Protestants in Ireland stated that they were opposing Irish self-government, because it would result in \\"Rome Rule\\" instead of home rule, and this became an element in (or an excuse for) the creation of Northern Ireland. The church continued to have great influence in Ireland. √âamon de Valera's 1937 constitution, while granting freedom of religion, recognised the \\"special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church\\". Major popular church events attended by the political world have included the Eucharistic Congress in 1932 and the Papal Visit in 1979. The last prelate with strong social and political interests was Archbishop McQuaid, who retired in 1972. Pope Francis visited Ireland in 2018 upon invitation extended to the Supreme Pontiff by Ireland's Catholic bishops to visit the country in August 2018 for the World Meeting of Families. This was only the second visit of a pope to the country, the first one having taken place in 1979 with John Paul II. =Education= After independence in 1922, the Church became more heavily involved in health care and education, raising money and managing institutions which were staffed by Catholic religious institutes, paid largely by government intervention and public donations and bequests. Its main political effect was to continue to gain power in the national primary schools where religious proselytisation in education was a major element. The hierarchy opposed the free public secondary schools service introduced in 1968 by Donogh O'Malley, in part because they ran almost all such schools. The church's strong efforts since the 1830s to continue the control of Catholic education was primarily an effort to guarantee a continuing source of candidates for the priesthood, as they would have years of training before entering a seminary.E. Brian Titley \\"Church, State and the control of schooling in Ireland 1900‚Äì1944\\"; McGill-Queen's Univ. Press, New York 1983. As Irish society has become more diverse and secular, Catholic control over primary education has become controversial, especially with regard to preference given to baptized Catholics when schools are oversubscribed. Virtually all state-funded primary schools ‚Äì almost 97 percent ‚Äì are under church control. Irish law allows schools under church control to consider religion the main factor in admissions. Oversubscribed schools often choose to admit Catholics over non-Catholics, a situation that has created difficulty for non-Catholic families. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva asked Ireland's minister for children, James Reilly, to explain the continuation of preferential access to state-funded schools on the basis of religion. He said that the laws probably needed to change, but noted it may take a referendum because the Irish constitution gives protections to religious institutions. The issue is most problematic in the Dublin area. A petition initiated by a Dublin barrister, Paddy Monahan, has received almost 20,000 signatures in favor of overturning the preference given to Catholic children. A recently formed advocacy group, Education Equality, is planning a legal challenge.Catholic Church‚Äôs Hold on Schools at Issue in Changing Ireland The New York Times, January 21, 2016 =Health care= From 1930, hospitals were funded by a sweepstake (lottery) with tickets frequently distributed or sold by nuns or priests. In 1950, the Church opposed the Mother and Child Scheme. Less hospitals in Ireland are still run by Catholic religious institutes. For example, the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin is run by the Sisters of Mercy. In 2005, the hospital deferred trials of a lung cancer medication because female patients in the trial would be required to practise contraception contrary to Catholic teaching. Mater Hospital responded that its objection was that some pharmaceutical companies mandated that women of childbearing years use contraceptives during the drug trials: \\"The hospital said it was committed to meeting all of its legal requirements regarding clinical trials while at the same time upholding the principles and ethos of the hospital's mission\\", and \\"that individuals and couples have the right to decide themselves about how they avoid pregnancy.\\" =Public morality= Divorce allowing remarriage was banned in 1924 (though it had been rare), and selling artificial contraception was made illegal. The Church's influence slipped somewhat after 1970, impacted partly by the media and the growing feminist movement as well as the sexual revolution. For instance, the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 showed the ability of the Catholic Church to influence the government to compromise over artificial contraception, though the Church was unable to get the result it wanted‚Äîcontraception could now be bought, but only with a prescription from a doctor and supplied only by registered chemists. A 1983 Amendment to the constitution introduced the constitutional prohibition of abortion, which the Church supported, though abortion for social reasons had already been illegal under Irish statutory law. However, the Church failed to influence the June 1996 removal of the constitutional prohibition of divorce. While the Church opposed divorce allowing remarriage in civil law, its canon law allowed for a law of nullity and a limited divorce \\"a mensa et thoro\\", effectively a form of marital separation. The Church helped reinforce public censorship and maintained its own list of banned literature until 1966, which influenced the State's list. In spite of objections from the Catholic hierarchy, voters in Ireland approved a referendum to legalise same-sex marriage in 2015 and abortion in 2018. In September 2010, an Irish Times/Behaviour Attitudes survey of 1,006 people showed that 67% felt that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. This majority extended across all age groups, with the exception of the over-65s, while 66% of Catholics were in favour of same-sex marriage. Only 25% disagreed that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry, opposition that was concentrated among older people and those in rural areas. In terms of same-sex adoption, 46% were in support of it and 38% opposed. However, a majority of females, 18- to 44-year-olds, and urban dwellers supported the idea. The survey also showed that 91% of people would not think less of someone who came out as homosexual, while 60% felt the recent civil partnership legislation was not an attack on marriage. War-time censorship by the government for security was strict and included the church; when bishops spoke on aspects of the war, they were censored and treated \\"with no more ceremony than any other citizen\\" While statements and pastoral letters issued from the pulpit were not interfered with, the quoting of them in the press was subject to the censor. =Sex abuse scandals= Several reports detailing cases of emotional, physical and sexual abuse of thousands of children while in the pastoral care of dozens of priests have been published in 2005‚Äì2009. These include the Ferns Report and the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, and have led on to much discussion in Ireland about what changes may be needed in the future within the Church. Popular traditions Alongside the church itself, many Irish devotional traditions have continued for centuries as a part of the church's local culture. One such tradition, unbroken since ancient times, is of annual pilgrimages to sacred Celtic Christian places such as St Patrick's Purgatory and Croagh Patrick. Particular emphasis on mortification and offerings of sacrifices and prayers for the 'Holy Souls' of Purgatory is another strong, long time cultural practice. The Leonine Prayers were said at the end of Low Mass for the deceased of the penal times. \\"Patterns\\" (processions) in honour of local saints also continue to this day. Marian Devotion is an element, focused on the shrine at Knock, an approved apparition of the Virgin Mary who appeared in 1879. Feasts and devotions such as the Immaculate Conception of Mary (1854) and the Sacred Heart of Jesus (1642), and the concepts of martyrology are very prominent elements. Respect for mortification of the flesh has led on to the veneration of Matt Talbot and Padre Pio.

Early history The site of the castle, in the west of the town is likely to have been a Roman encampment, as it has an irregular and quadrilateral layout. Fifteenth century origins Penrith Castle was built between 1399 and 1470 as a defence against Scottish raids; it has been said that, unlike so many of its counterparts in the north, 'the building exhibits no indication of very ancient date.' The lordship of Penrith was created in 1397 as a grant to the newly created earl of Westmorland, but the castle was first mentioned in a grant of 1437. Previously believed to have been first built by William Strickland who later become Bishop of Carlisle, the lateness of this reference, it has been suggested, indicates that the most likely builder was Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury. However, it is not known whether this was ‚Äònew work on a fresh site, or whether he simply utilized Strickland‚Äôs works as the core of his building.‚Äô It is now considered more likely that Strickland built Hutton Hall, near the church in Penrith, instead, and furthermore that a 'tenurial reconstruction shows that he [Strickland] did not hold the castle site.' There is a possible reference to a construction in the site of the castle as early as 1412, and Ralph Neville is known to have granted the building of a tower there, from his comital seat at Raby, the next year.Perriam, D.R., 'William Strickland's Tower in Penrith: Penrith Castle or Hutton Hall?' The English Heritage Historical Review, vol.3 no.1 (1 June 2008), p.44 Either way, it seems most unlikely that 'it was built not by a baron, but by the inhabitants themselves, for their own defence,' as was once stated.Marr, J.E., Cumberland (Cambridge County Geographies series), Cambridge 1910, p.126 Penrith castle in 1772.Gilpin, William (1786), Observations relative chiefly to Picturesque Beauty, Made in the year 1772 .....

They were granted in 1471 to Richard, Duke of Gloucester by King Edward IV, who used Penrith as a base whilst 'taking effectual measures' against the Scots, and also 'enjoyed the revenues of the estates' of the Forest of Cumberland.Ferguson, R.S., A History of Cumberland (Popular County Histories series), London 1890 p.238 It was at the same time that the duke was appointed sheriff of Cumberland five consecutive years, being described as 'of Penrith Castle' in 1478. Later period Exterior of present-day ruins of Penrith Castle, 2008 Following Gloucester's usurpation and death (1483‚Äì85), the castle and the town remained part of the Crown Estate until the reign of William III who gave it and most other Crown property in Cumberland to his friend Hans Willem Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland in 1696. The castle was sold by the Earls and Dukes of Portland to the Dukes of Devonshire in 1787. They later sold it to the Lancaster & Carlisle Railway Company who built Penrith railway station; its remains are opposite the railway station today. It later passed into the ownership of the Penrith Urban District Council, who in the 1920s converted the grounds into a public park and built housing nearby. The few ruins that remain today were described in the nineteenth century as not 'very interesting in respect of their antiquity, or their present appearance.' Also, very much as they stand today: :The ruins are remarkable more for their extent than their magnificence: the chief objects of interest are the projecting corbels in the eastern front, which appear to have supported an open corridor; there are some large vaults, which were probably prisons. The walls, broken in many places, and intersected with remaining windows, assume, from different points of view, striking varieties of perspective scenery. After the great civil war, the edifice was dismantled, and part of the materials sold. The castle is maintained by English Heritage, and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building.

The film was directed by John Whitesell and starring Martin Lawrence reprising his role as FBI agent Malcolm Turner, along with Nia Long, Zachary Levi, Mark Moses, Emily Procter, Kat Dennings, and Chlo√´ Grace Moretz in supporting roles. Unlike the first film, Big Momma's House 2 takes on a family friendly tone compared to the original film's more mature target demographic. The film was released theatrically on January 27, 2006 by 20th Century Fox. It was a box office success and grossing $141.5 million against a budget of $40 million. Plot Six years after the events of the first film, Malcolm Turner (Martin Lawrence) has been assigned a desk job in public relations as an FBI agent, since he wants to live with his wife, Sherry Pierce (Nia Long), during her delivery for the couple's new baby boy. Meanwhile, an incident occurs in Orange County, California, where Malcolm's old friend, Doug Hudson (Kirk B.R. Woller), has been killed while he was going undercover. FBI agent Kevin Keneally (Zachary Levi) is doing surveillance on a former U.S. Army military intelligence specialist named Tom Fuller (Mark Moses), who has since retired and is working for a private corporation called National Agenda Software. The FBI has discovered that Tom is developing a computer worm which will create backdoors into the databases of all the branches of the U.S. government. Affected by his friend's death, Malcolm asks FBI chief, Crawford (Dan Lauria), to put him on the case, but Crawford refuses and tells him to stay away for safety analysis. By eavesdropping via the webcam, Malcolm finds out that the FBI is sending one of the agents to infiltrate Fuller's house as a nanny. Giving Sherry the pretext of attending a safety conference in Phoenix, Arizona, Malcolm leaves for Orange County and takes the \\"Big Momma\\" costume with him. Malcolm reprises his disguise as Big Momma and shows up at Fuller's house as Mrs. Fuller (Emily Procter) is interviewing several other candidates. Big Momma eliminates the three other applicants for the nanny position by pointing out the sexually attractive qualities of the first, the drug use of the second, and the FBI agent's concealed firearm of the third. Big Momma meets the three Fuller children: Molly (Kat Dennings), Carrie (Chlo√´ Grace Moretz), and Andrew. After failing to perform the housekeeping tasks assigned to her, Big Momma is fired, and works all night cleaning up and makes a large breakfast. Upon seeing it the next day, Mrs. Fuller changes her mind when the family awakes to find this. Big Momma is soon accepted within the household and becomes a daily part of their lives. His tasks include accompanying Mrs. Fuller to the spa, taking the family to the beach, watching out for trouble, and simply playing a game of bingo as part of her routine. After Big Momma finds out the password from Tom, Molly calls him who tells her that she needs her at a nightclub. Big Momma goes at once, only to find that Molly was lured by Fuller's bosses, who kidnaps her and Big Momma. Big Momma and Molly are tied up and placed in the back of the van. Big Momma has a switchblade, which Molly reaches for and uses to free them. He sees that they are at the waterfront and witnesses Tom giving a disc to a man who puts it in his laptop and is granted full access to FBI data. Big Momma gets on a jet ski and jumps it onto the dock, sending it into two men, and landing on one himself. Big Momma helps Tom and they attempt to escape, but one of the men shot him. The FBI shows up, and Keneally gives Malcolm handcuffs to put on Tom, but Malcolm tells the agent in charge that Tom's family was threatened, and that no charges should be filed. Malcolm and Keneally agree, and the case is closed. Sometime later, Big Momma goes to the girls' state cheerleading championships. Their stuntwoman broke her leg, and Big Momma helps them out by doing the routine and winning the competition. He later leaves and gives the family a farewell letter saying he must go on, but to look out, because one day he might be back.

It combines fantasy, philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. Described by critic, novelist, and philosopher Colin Wilson as the \\"greatest novel of the twentieth century\\", it was a central influence on C. S. Lewis' Space Trilogy, and through him on J. R. R. Tolkien, who said he read the book \\"with avidity\\". Clive Barker called it \\"a masterpiece\\" and \\"an extraordinary work ... quite magnificent.\\" An interstellar voyage is the framework for a narrative of a journey through fantastic landscapes. The story is set at Tormance, an imaginary planet orbiting Arcturus, which in the novel (but not in reality) is a double star system, consisting of stars Branchspell and Alppain. The lands through which the characters travel represent philosophical systems or states of mind, through which the main character, Maskull, passes on his search for the meaning of life. The book sold poorly during Lindsay's lifetime, but was republished in 1946 and many times thereafter. It has been translated into at least ten languages. Critics such as the novelist Michael Moorcock have noted that the book is unusual, but has been highly influential with its qualities of \\"commitment to the Absolute\\" and \\"God-questioning genius\\". Context David Lindsay was born in 1876; his father was a Scottish Calvinist and his mother English. He was brought up in London and Jedburgh in the Scottish borders. He enjoyed reading novels by Walter Scott, Jules Verne, Rider Haggard and Robert Louis Stevenson. He learnt German to read the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. He served in the army in the First World War, being called up at the age of 38. He married in 1916. After the war ended in 1918, he moved to Cornwall with his wife to write. Lindsay told his friend E. H. Visiak that his greatest influence was the work of George MacDonald.David Lindsay, by Gary K. Wolfe ContentsSynopsis= Maskull, a man longing for adventures, accepts an invitation from Krag, an acquaintance of his friend Nightspore, to travel to Tormance after a seance. The three set off in a crystal ship from an abandoned observatory in Scotland but Maskull awakens to find himself alone on Tormance. In every land he passes through he usually meets only one or two persons; these meetings often (though not always) end in the death of those he meets, either at his own hand or by that of another. He learns of his own impending death, meets Krag again, and dies shortly after learning that he is in fact Nightspore himself. The book concludes with a final revelation from Krag (who claims to be known on Earth as \\"Pain\\") to Nightspore about the origin of the Universe. The author turns out to support a variation of the doctrine of the Demiurge, somewhat similar to that propounded by some Gnostics. All of the characters and lands are types used to convey the author's critique of several philosophical systems. On Tormance, most such viewpoints or ways of life are accompanied by corresponding new bodily sense organs or modifications of the same, thus each distinct Weltanschauung landscape has its corresponding sensorium. =Chapters= ; 1 ‚Äì The Seance A seance is organised in Hampstead to which Maskull and Nightspore are invited; their late arrival is marked by a supernatural noise. The medium causes a smiling man to materialise. Krag arrives uninvited, kills the apparition by breaking its neck, and summarily calls Maskull and Nightspore (with whom he was acquainted) out to the street. ; 2 ‚Äì In the Street Krag invites Maskull and Nightspore to come to Tormance, a planet orbiting Arcturus, whence the apparition comes. Maskull initially treats the proposal as a joke, but accepts it when Krag shows him, with a small but strangely heavy and potent lens, that Arcturus consists of two suns. Upon questioning from Nightspore, Krag says that Surtur (unknown to Maskull) has gone ahead and that they must follow him. ; 3 ‚Äì Starkness Maskull and Nightspore arrive on foot (after travelling by train) at the Scottish observatory of Starkness, where Krag was to meet them, only to find the observatory abandoned. Two bottles are found with \\"Solar back rays\\" and \\"Arcturian back rays\\". The first, when accidentally unfastened, flies back to the sun because of the light rays trapped within. ; 4 ‚Äì The Voice Nightspore leads Maskull to a spot on the shore some miles off, where they listen to The Drum Taps of Sorgie, and tells him that if he hears it again he is to \\"try always to hear it more and more distinctly.\\" Maskull attempts to climb the observatory tower but is unable to go beyond the first of the seven stories because of the heavy gravity. From the first magnifying window he sees Arcturus again. He hears a voice saying that he is but an instrument and that although he will go on the voyage, only Nightspore will return. ; 5 ‚Äì The Night of Departure Nightspore says the gravity in the tower is Tormance's and that Maskull will find death on Tormance. Krag arrives, enables Maskull and Nightspore to resist Tormance's gravity by spitting on a cut in their arms, and the three climb the tower, whose windows no longer magnify. They depart naked in a 'torpedo of crystal' propelled by Arcturian back rays. During the 19-hour voyage, Maskull sleeps. ; 6 ‚Äì Joiwind Maskull awakes alone in a desert on Tormance and finds that he has new organs in his body, such as a tentacle (known as a magn) stemming from the heart and protuberances on his forehead and neck. A woman comes to him and exchanges blood with him (making it easier for him to live on Tormance, and harder for her), and says: that she is called Joiwind, her husband Panawe, and both live to the North in Poolingdred; that she understands his speech thanks to a forehead organ, the breve, that reads minds; that Surtur is called Shaping, or Crystalman, and created everything (she also implicitly says that he is God); that they do not eat, out of respect for living things, but drink gnawl water; and that the chest tentacle is used to increase love for other creatures. While journeying home they worship Shaping in a shrine, and meet Panawe upon arrival. ; 7 ‚Äì Panawe Panawe suggests that Maskull may be \\"a man [...] who stole something from the Maker of the universe, in order to ennoble his fellow creatures,\\" a reference to the myth of Prometheus. He says that life on Tormance has many different forms because the planet is still new, that human beings resemble earthlings because \\"all creatures that resemble Shaping must of necessity resemble one another,\\" and that Alppain is visible only to the North. Panawe tells his story to Maskull; he travelled in the Wombflash forest (from where he saw Swaylone's island), Ifdawn Marest, and Poolingdred. ; 8 ‚Äì The Lusion Plain Maskull sets out to further explore Tormance and gets to the Lusion Plain, where he meets a man, named Surtur. Surtur asserts the beauty of his world, claims Maskull is there to serve him, and disappears. Maskull continues his journey and meets a woman, Oceaxe, from Ifdawn, who instead of a tentacle has a third arm. Although she is peremptory and rude, she shows interest in having him as lover, and gives him a red-glowing stone to convert his magn into a third arm. ; 9 ‚Äì Oceaxe When Maskull wakes up he finds his chest tentacle or magn has been transformed into the third arm, which causes lust for what is touched and his breve changed to an eyelike sorb which allows dominance of will over others. He travels through the volatile and Nietzschean landscape of Ifdawn with Oceaxe, who wants him to kill one of her husbands, Crimtyphon, and take his place. Maskull is revolted at the idea, but does kill Crimtyphon when he sees him using his will to force a man into becoming a tree. ; 10 ‚Äì Tydomin Tydomin, another wife of Crimtyphon's, shows up and uses her will to force Oceaxe to commit suicide by walking off a cliff and persuades Maskull to follow her to her home in Disscourn, where she will take possession of his body. On the way they find Joiwind's brother Digrung who says he will tell her everything; to prevent this, and encouraged by Tydomin, Maskull absorbs Digrung, leaving his empty body behind. At Tydomin's cave, he goes out of his body to, anachronistically, become the apparition of the seance where he met Krag, but when he is killed he goes back to his body before Tydomin can possess it, whereupon he awakens free of her mental power. ; 11 ‚Äì On Disscourn Maskull takes Tydomin to Sant, to kill her. In Sant no women are allowed, but only men, who go there to follow Hator's doctrine. On the way Maskull and Tydomin meet Spadevil, who proposes to reform Sant by amending Hator's teaching with the notion of duty. He turns Maskull and Tydomin into his disciples by modifying their sorbs into twin membranes called probes. ; 12 ‚Äì Spadevil Catice, the guardian of Hator's doctrine in Sant, who has only one probe, damages one of Maskull's to test Spadevil's arguments. Maskull accepts Hator's ideas and kills Spadevil and Tydomin. Catice says he will leave Sant to meditate on Spadevil's arguments, claims that Shaping is not Surtur, and sends Maskull away to the Wombflash Forest, in search of Muspel, their home. ; 13 ‚Äì The Wombflash Forest Maskull awakes in the dense Wombflash Forest with a third eye as his only foreign organ, hears the drumbeat, follows it, and meets Dreamsinter, who tells him that it was Nightspore whom Surtur brought to Tormance and that he, Maskull, is wanted to steal Muspel-light. Maskull then sees a vision in which Krag kills him while Nightspore follows a light, and faints. ; 14 ‚Äì Polecrab Maskull reawakes and proceeds to the shore of the Sinking Sea, from which Swaylone's Island can be seen. There he meets Polecrab, a simple fisherman, who is married to Gleameil. ; 15 ‚Äì Swaylone's Island Maskull goes to Swaylone's Island, where Earthrid plays a musical instrument called Irontick (actually a lake) by night, and from where no one who heard it ever returned. Maskull is accompanied by Gleameil, who has left her family because of the attraction of the music. Earthrid warns Gleameil that the music he plays will kill her, but she stays and promptly dies. Maskull, after entering a trance, forcibly plays the lake, whereupon Earthrid dies, violently dismembered, and Irontick is destroyed. ; 16 ‚Äì Leehallfae Maskull crosses the sea by manoeuvring a many-eyed, heliotropic tree and reaches Matterplay, where much to his amazement a plethora of life-forms alongside a magical creek materialise and vanish before his eyes. He goes upstream and meets Leehallfae, an immensely old being (\\"phaen\\") who is neither man nor woman, but of a third sex, who has been seeking the underground country of Threal for eons, where ae [sic] believes a god called Faceny (which may be another name for Shaping) is to be found. ; 17 ‚Äì Corpang They reach Threal by entering a cave. Leehallfae promptly falls ill and dies. Corpang appears and says this is because Threal is not Faceny's world, but Thire's. Faceny, Amfuse, and Thire are the creators of three worlds of existence, relation, and feeling. Corpang has come to Threal to follow Thire, and leads Maskull to three statues of these divinities. There Maskull has a vision of their power, and hears a voice saying he is to die in a few hours, after which the statues are seen with faces like a corpse's, showing that they are merely disguises for Shaping/Crystalman. Realising that he has been worshipping false gods, Corpang follows Maskull to Lichstorm, where they hear the drumbeats. ; 18 ‚Äì Haunte Maskull and Corpang meet Haunte, a hunter who travels in a boat that flies thanks to masculine stones which repel earth's femininity. After Maskull destroys the masculine rocks which protected Haunte from Sullenbode's femininity, all three journey to her cave. Sullenbode, a faceless woman, kills Haunte as they kiss. ; 19 ‚Äì Sullenbode Maskull desires Sullenbode and she desires him, thereby becoming alive (without killing him) as long as he loves her. Maskull, Sullenbode and Corpang proceed in the direction someone looking for Muspel once went. As they near their destination, Corpang goes eagerly ahead but Maskull stops, caught in a vision of Muspel-light. His momentary loss of interest and her inability to recall him from his trance causes Sullenbode to die. As the vision fades Maskull discovers Sullenbode and, leaving Corpangs path, proceeds down the mountain to bury Sullenbode. ; 20 ‚Äì Barey Maskull, upon waking, discovers Krag again, and then Gangnet, who defends Shaping and his creation. Since Gangnet is unable to send the abusive Krag away, they travel together to the ocean and then take to the sea on a raft. When the sun Alppain rises, Maskull sees in a vision Krag causing the drum beat by beating his heart, and Gangnet, who is Shaping, dying in torment enveloped by Muspel-fire. Back on the raft, Krag tells Maskull that he (Maskull) is Nightspore; then Maskull dies. ; 21 ‚Äì Muspel Krag and Nightspore arrive at Muspel, where there is a tower similar to that in Starkness (the observatory in Scotland). From the windows of its several stories Nightspore sees that Shaping (the Gnostic demiurge) uses what comes from Muspel to create the world in order that he may feel joy, fragmenting the Muspel matter in the process and producing suffering for all living things. Krag acknowledges that he is Surtur and is known on Earth as pain. Nightspore goes back with him to reincarnate and spread knowledge about Surtur, Shaping, and Muspel. SettingGeography= The story is set on Tormance, an imaginary planet orbiting the star Arcturus, which, in the novel (but not in reality) is a double star system, consisting of Branchspell, a large yellow sunlike star, and Alppain, a smaller blue star. It is said in the novel to be 100 light- years distant from Earth. There is no systematic description of the geography of Tormance; Maskull simply travels from South to North (with a somewhat eastward excursion to the Sant levels). The direction is symbolic: the light of the second sun, Alppain, is seen to the north; the southern countries are illuminated only by Branchspell. Maskull travels always in the direction that puts behind him earthly sights and things, seeking the other world illuminated by Alppain. =Names= The names \\"Surtur\\" and \\"Muspel\\" used in the book are from Surtr, the lord of M√∫spellsheimr, here in a 1909 painting by John Charles Dollman. The historian Shimon de Valencia states that the names \\"Surtur\\" and \\"Muspel\\" are taken from Surtr, the lord of M√∫spellsheimr (the world of fire) in Norse mythology. Lindsay's choice of title (and therefore the setting in Arcturus) may have been influenced by the nonfictional A Voyage to the Arctic in the Whaler Aurora (1911), published by his namesake, David Moore Lindsay. =Inventions= The novel is recognised for its strangeness. Among the many features of the world of Tormance are its alien sea, with water so dense that it can be walked on, while gnawl water is sufficient food to sustain life on its own. The local spectrum includes two primary colours, ulfire and jale, unknown on Earth, as well as a third colour, dolm, said to be compounded of ulfire and blue. (Lindsay writes: ' sense impressions caused in Maskull by these two additional primary colours can only be vaguely hinted at by analogy. Just as blue is delicate and mysterious, yellow clear and unsubtle, and red sanguine and passionate, so he felt ulfire to be wild and painful, and jale dreamlike, feverish, and voluptuous.') Tormance people are able to speak to people from Earth, as their ability to read thoughts enables them to understand both meaning and words. The planet itself is entirely un-Earthlike with unique life-forms, such as three-legged animals that spin, and a ten- finned flying animal. The sexuality of the Tormance species is ambiguous; Lindsay coined a new gender-specific pronoun series, ' for the phaen who are humanoid but formed of air. The character Panawe who briefly guides Maskull was born male and female, but becomes male when his female component relinquishes life to allow him to live as a male. Maskull himself acquires Tormance organs which give him additional senses including telepathy; these include a tentacle on his chest and a fleshy organ on his forehead that changes into a third eye. EffectInfluence= The novel was a central influence on C. S. Lewis's 1938‚Äì1945 Space Trilogy. Lewis also mentioned the \\"sorbing\\" (aggressive absorption of another's personality into one's own, fatal to the other person) as an influence on his 1942 book The Screwtape Letters. Lewis in turn recommended the book to J. R. R. Tolkien, who said he read it \\"with avidity\\", finding it more powerful, more mythical but less of a story than Lewis's Out of the Silent Planet; he commented that \\"no one could read it merely as a thriller and without interest in philosophy[,] religion[,] and morals\\". In 1984, the composer John Ogdon wrote an oratorio for soprano, mezzosoprano, tenor, and baritone accompanied by choir and piano entitled, A Voyage to Arcturus. He based the oratorio on Lindsay's novel and \\"biblical quotations\\". Ogdon's biographer, Charles Beauclerk, notes that Lindsay was also a composer, and that the novel discusses the \\"nature and meaning\\" of music. In Beauclerk's view, Ogdon saw Linday's novel as a religious work, where for instance the wild 3-eyed, 3-armed woman Oceaxe becomes Oceania, described in the Bible's Book of Revelation 12 as \\"a woman cloth'd with the sun, and the moon under her feet\\". =Reception= The critic and philosopher Colin Wilson described A Voyage to Arcturus as the \\"greatest novel of the twentieth century\\". Clive Barker stated that \\"A Voyage to Arcturus is a masterpiece\\" and called it \\"an extraordinary work . . . quite magnificent.\\" Philip Pullman named it for The Guardian as the book he thought was most underrated. Reviewing the book in 2002, the novelist Michael Moorcock asserted that \\"Few English novels have been as eccentric or, ultimately, as influential\\". He noted that Alan Moore, introducing the 2002 edition, had compared the book to John Bunyan (Pilgrim's Progress, 1678) and Arthur Machen (The Great God Pan, 1890), but that it nevertheless stood \\"as one of the great originals\\". In Moorcock's view, although Maskull seems to be commanded to do whatever is needed to save his soul, in a kind of \\"Nietzschean Pilgrim's Progress\\", Lindsay does not fall into fascism. Like Hitler, Moorcock argued, Lindsay was traumatised by the trench fighting of the First World War, but the \\"astonishing and dramatic ambiguity of the novel's resolution\\" makes the novel the antithesis of Hitler's \\"visionary brutalism\\". Moorcock noted that while the book had influenced C. S. Lewis's science fiction trilogy, Lewis had \\"refused Lindsay's commitment to the Absolute and lacked his God-questioning genius, the very qualities which give this strange book its compelling, almost mesmerising influence.\\" Also in 2002, Steven H. Silver, criticising A Voyage to Arcturus on SF Site, observes that for a novel it has little plot or characterisation, and furthermore that it gives no motives for the actions taken by its characters. In his view, the book's strength lies in its \\"philosophical musings\\" on humanity after the First World War. Silver compares the book not with later science fiction but with that of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, \\"although with neither author's prose skills.\\" He suggests that Lindsay was combining philosophy with an adventure tale in the manner of Edgar Rice Burroughs. =Publication history= Methuen agreed to publish the novel, but only if Lindsay agreed to cut 15,000 words, which he did. These passages are assumed lost forever. Methuen also insisted on a change of title, from Lindsay's original (Nightspore in Tormance), as it was considered too obscure.Sellin, Bernard, The Life & Works of David Lindsay (Cambridge University Press, 1981), p. 22. But out of an original press run of 1430 copies, no more than 596 were sold in total. A Voyage to Arcturus was made widely available in paperback form when published as one of the precursor volumes to the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in 1968, featuring a cover by illustrator Bob Pepper.\\"The art of Bob Pepper\\", on John Coulthart's feuilleton, 12 July 2007. Editions of A Voyage to Arcturus have been published in 1920 (Methuen), 1946 (Gollancz), 1963 (Gollancz, Macmillan, Ballantine), 1968 (Gollancz, Ballantine),1971 (Gollancz), 1972, 1973, 1974 (Ballantine), 1978 (Gollancz), 1992 (Canongate), 2002 (Univ. Nebraska), and later by several publishers. The book has been translated into Bulgarian, Catalan, Dutch, French, German, Japanese, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, and Turkish. = Adaptations and sequels by others = The BBC Third Programme presented a radio dramatisation of the novel in 1956. Critic Harold Bloom, in his only attempt at fiction writing, wrote a sequel to this novel, entitled The Flight to Lucifer. Bloom has since critiqued the book as a poor continuation of the narrative. William J. Holloway, then a student at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio created a 71-minute film adaptation of the novel in 1970. The film, unavailable for many years, was independently restored, re-edited and color-enhanced, to be redistributed on DVD-R in 2005. In 1985, a three-hour play by David Wolpe based on the novel was staged in Los Angeles.\\"'A Voyage to Arcturus': A Journey to an Enigma\\" by Sylvie Drake, Los Angeles Times, 2 October 1985. Paul Corfield Godfrey wrote an operatic setting based on the novel to a libretto by Richard Charles Rose and this was performed at the Sherman Theatre Cardiff in 1983. Jazz composer Ron Thomas recorded a concept album inspired by the novel in 2001 entitled Scenes from A Voyage to Arcturus.. Music from the album is featured in the 2005 restoration of the 1970 student film. Ukrainian house producer Vakula (Mikhaylo Vityk) released an imaginary soundtrack called A Voyage To Arcturus as a triple LP in 2015.

He stepped down as CEO of Time Warner on December 31, 2007.David Faber, \\"Time Warner Confirms Parsons Stepping Down\\", CNBC, November 5, 2007. He was previously the interim CEO of the Los Angeles Clippers NBA franchise. In September 2018, Parsons became the Interim Chairman of the Board for CBS replacing Les Moonves. On October 21, 2018, he resigned for health reasons from CEO at CBS and was replaced by Strauss Zelnick. Early life Parsons was born to an African-American family in Brooklyn, New York, on April 4, 1948. He was one of five children. His maternal grandfather had been head groundskeeper at the John D. Rockefeller estate, Kykuit. Growing up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, Parsons's father, Lorenzo Locklair Parsons, was an electrical technician and his mother, Isabelle (n√©e Judd) was a homemaker. He skipped a grade in elementary school and another in high school. He later attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where at 6'4\\" tall he may have played varsity basketball. After four years, he was seven credits short of his diploma. However, he discovered that he could get into a law school in New York without a college degree if he scored well enough on his pre-law exams. Parsons was accepted by Albany Law School of Union University, New York, where he earned a Juris Doctor in 1971, finishing at the top of his class. Career In 1971, Parsons served an internship at the New York State Legislature, at which time he was invited to work as a lawyer for the staff of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. When Rockefeller was appointed Vice President of the United States, in 1974, Parsons followed him to Washington D.C., where he worked directly with President Gerald Ford. He also met a deputy attorney general, Harold R. Tyler, and one of his aides, a young Rudolph W. Giuliani, with whom he was to be closely associated - supporting him in his campaign for New York mayor and heading his transitional council.Richard Parsons profile, New York Times, 2001. In 1977, Parsons returned to New York and became a partner after only two years at the Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler law firm; also working at the firm was Giuliani. During his 11 years at the firm Parsons took on Happy Rockefeller, the widow of Nelson (who had died in 1979) as a high-profile client.\\"Richard Parsons Biography\\", Encyclopedia of World Biography. In 1988, he was recruited to serve as chief operating officer of the Dime Savings Bank of New York by CEO Harry W. Albright Jr., who was a former Rockefeller aide. Parsons later became Chairman and CEO and oversaw a merger with Anchor Savings Bank, gaining a substantial sum when the Dime Bank was demutualized. Three years later, in 1991, on the recommendation of Nelson's brother Laurance Rockefeller to the then CEO Steve Ross, Parsons was invited to join Time Warner's board; he subsequently became president of the company in 1995, recruited by chief executive Gerald Levin. He helped negotiate the company's merger with America Online in 2000, creating a $165-billion media conglomerate that is \\"usually described as the worst merger of all time.\\" In December 2001, it was announced that Levin would retire and Parsons had been selected as his successor. The announcement surprised many media watchers who expected chief operating officer Robert Pittman to take the helm. In 2003, Parsons made the announcement of the name change from AOL Time Warner to simply Time Warner. Parsons became chairman of Citigroup on 23 February 2009. He is chairman of the Advisory Board of Feigen Advisors, a CEO advisory firm run by Marc Feigen. In September 2018, Parsons became the Interim Chairman of the Board for CBS, replacing Les Moonves. In October 2018 Parsons stepped down from the position, citing difficulties brought about by his battle with Multiple myeloma. He was replaced by Strauss Zelnick. =Humanitarian causes= In 2007, Parsons became the chairman of the board of directors of the Jazz Foundation of America. He is also Chair of the Apollo Theater Foundation and Co-Chair of the Advisory Board of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. In June 2016, Parsons was appointed Board Chair of The Rockefeller Foundation, a foundation promoting the wellbeing of humanity all over the world. He joined the foundation's Board of Trustees in 2008. =Prominent connections= From the early 1980s through much of the 1990s, Parsons owned a house near the Rockefeller family estate in Pocantico Hills (see Kykuit), where his grandfather was once a groundskeeper. For a brief time he worked for Nelson Rockefeller at the family office, \\"Room 5600\\", at Rockefeller Center. Parsons became chairman emeritus of the Partnership for New York City, established by David Rockefeller in 1979, who has known him for many years. He became an advisory trustee of the family's principal philanthropy, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and he sits with David Rockefeller on the board of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation. Parsons is also on the board of the family-created Museum of Modern Art. In 2001, United States President George W. Bush selected Parsons to co-chair a commission on Social Security. Parsons also worked on the transition team for Michael Bloomberg, who was elected Mayor of New York City in 2001. In 2006, Parsons was selected to co- chair the transition team for the incoming Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer.Partnership Members Assist Spitzer Transition Team In August 2006, an article in New York Magazine reported that Parsons would likely run for Mayor of New York City in the 2009 New York mayoral election.Geoffrey Gray, \\"Is Parsons the New Bloomberg?\\", New York Magazine. Parsons, however, repeatedly denied the reports, supported Mayor Bloomberg's efforts to repeal the term limits law, and supported Bloomberg for a third term in office.Times Topics, 2009 Parsons for Bloomberg Parsons was a member of the economic advisory team for President Barack Obama. He met with the then President-elect on Friday, November 7, 2008, along with many other economic experts, to discuss measures to solve the current economic crisis. After New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson withdrew his name from consideration for the position of Secretary of Commerce in the Obama Administration, Parsons's name was floated as a possible nominee. On May 9, 2014, in the wake of the Donald Sterling racial remarks controversy, it was announced that Richard Parsons was appointed the interim CEO of the Los Angeles Clippers. Personal life In 1968, Parsons married Laura Ann Bush, a community activist with a doctorate in child psychology, who he met at the University of Hawaii. They have three grown children: Gregory, Leslie, and Rebecca.George Rush, \\"Love tangle for power broker: Citigroup's Richard Parsons has love child with model MacDella Cooper\\", New York Daily News, May 21, 2009.

Shearn, \\"Scrapbook of Extremes\\", New Jersey Monthly, June 8, 2009.Hamilton Nolan, \\"Dick Parsons Secret Love Child\\", Gawker, May 22, 2009. Being of Liberian ethnicity, Cooper founded the MacDella Cooper Foundation in 2004 to help orphans and abandoned children in Liberia following the Second Liberian Civil War. In 2015, Parsons was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a rare form of blood cancer. Though he went into remission after Stem-cell therapy, complications in 2018 caused him to step down from his role as Interim Chairman of the Board of CBS. References External links  * Richard D.

George Breitman (February 28, 1916 ‚Äì April 19, 1986) was an American communist political activist and newspaper editor. He is best remembered as a founding member of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and as a long-time editor of that organization's weekly paper, The Militant. Breitman also supervised and edited several important publishing projects as the head of the SWP's publishing house in the 1960s and 1970s.

He later found a job working in the New Deal's Works Progress Administration.\\"Guide to the George Breitman Papers TAM 169,\\" Tamiment Library, New York University. =Political career= Breitman returned to Newark in 1935 and joined the Trotskyist movement as a member of the Spartacus Youth League, the youth section of the Workers Party of the United States (WPUS).Lubitz and Lubitz, \\"George Breitman,\\" p. 2. He joined the adult WPUS that same year.George Breitman, \\"Answers to Questions,\\" in The Founding of the Socialist Workers Party: Minutes and Resolutions, 1938-39. New York: Monad Press, 1982; p. 17. He also of became involved in the unemployed movement of the period as a leading activist in the New Jersey Workers Alliance. Breitman followed the Workers Party into the Socialist Party of America in the middle 1930s, before leaving to become a founding member of the Socialist Workers Party in December 1937. He was elected to the SWP's governing National Committee for the first time in 1939 and served continuously in that position until 1981. He was also frequently a member of the party's Political Committee, which handled day-to-day operations of the organization. In 1940, Breitman married Dorothea Katz (1914‚Äì2004). He was four times a candidate for the U.S. Senator from New Jersey on the SWP ticket, running in 1940, 1942, 1948, and 1954.Lawrence Kestenbaum (ed.), \\"George Breitman,\\" politicalgraveyard.com Retrieved March 18, 2010. Following the departure of Max Shachtman and his political associates to form a new Workers Party, Breitman was named editor of the SWP's weekly paper, The Militant. He held that post from 1941 until 1943, when he found himself drafted into the U.S. Army and sent to France. In March 1946 he participated in the first post- war conference of the Fourth International, held in Paris. He was arrested at this meeting along with other participants but quickly released, owing to his American citizenship. After the war, Breitman was once again named editor of The Militant, handling primary editorial duties from 1946 to 1954. During this time, he wrote copiously, publishing over 500 articles in The Militant from 1947 to 1955. In 1954, the Breitmans moved to Detroit, Michigan, where for the next 13 years they served as District Organizers for the SWP. There George and Dorothea Breitman helped to organize the \\"Friday Night Socialist Forum\\" (later called the \\"Militant Labor Forum\\"), a weekly lecture series that attracted participants a broad range of activists from labor, radical, and black liberation groups. To pay the bills, Breitman worked as a printer and proofreader for the Detroit Free Press. As such, he was a member of the International Typographical Union. Breitman returned from Detroit to New York in the late 1960s to take over management of the SWP's publishing arm, Pathfinder Press. In that capacity, he served as editor of a 14-volume collection entitled Writings of Leon Trotsky, 1929‚Äì1940, which was published from 1969 to 1979. During his time at the helm of Pathfinder, Breitman was instrumental in the publication of various collections of writings by SWP leading light James P. Cannon and a pioneering selection of writings by Malcolm X, entitled Malcolm X Speaks (1965). Although politically a child of the 1930s, Brietman was deeply influenced by the radical movements of the 1960s and 70s seeing them as a harbinger of a coming social revolution which he prophesied would have a \\"combined character\\" being both a socialist revolution of the working class against capitalism merged with the struggles and demands of \\"specially oppressed\\" people: Blacks, Latinos and other nationally oppressed people; women, gays and others, groups Brietman pointed that were, like the American population in general, overwhelmingly working class. Brietman described the radical movements of that period as constituting a \\"New Radicalization\\" that was deeper and broader than the ones he described as occurring before the Civil War among abolitionists and small farmers and later among industrial workers and socialists during the turn of the century in the era of the Bolshevik Revolution up through the 1930s. He thus saw that it portended the prospect of a great social upheaval. In a certain sense he adopted and translated into Old Left and orthodox marxist terms, New Leftist ideas. For this he was denounced as a Herbert Marcuse like revisionist by sectarian marxists, while others viewed his ideas as entirely correct, even visionary, which explored the issues Marcuse addressed on a deeper level, reconciling them with revolutionary marxism, whose adherents, in the words of Lenin, must at all times be \\"tribunes of the people\\" responding to every manifestation of tyranny and oppression. In the late 1970s Breitman opposed what he saw as a growing fixation of the SWP's top leadership on the Castroist leadership of the Cuban Communist Party, and became involved in a factional opposition group in the SWP beginning in 1981.Lubitz and Lubitz, \\"George Breitman,\\" p. 3. This disagreement over the direction ultimately led to Breitman's expulsion from the SWP in 1984. Despite ill health, Breitman played a leading role in the foundation of the Fourth Internationalist Tendency, which sought to unify U.S. supporters of the Fourth International. Continuing his editorial activities, he was a contributing editor of the group's journal, Bulletin in Defense of Marxism., .Lubitz and Lubitz, \\"George Breitman,\\" p. 3.

Life  Marchwitza was the son of miner Thomas Marchwitza and his wife Thekla Maxisch, and was born in Scharley (Szarlej) (now a part of Piekary ≈ölƒÖskie) near Beuthen in Upper Silesia. Already at fourteen years old (1904) Marchwitza was working underground in the mines. In 1910 he was hired to work in the Ruhr area. Two years later, however, he became unemployed because of his participation in a strike. Until he was drafted into the military in 1915, he worked as a laborer in odd jobs. He served on the Western Front until 1918. In 1919 he joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. In the following year, he fought as a commander for the Red Ruhr Army against the Kapp Putsch, Freikorps groups, and the Reichswehr during the Ruhr Uprising. In 1920, he joined the Communist Party of Germany. When France occupied the Ruhr area, he fought in resistance. In the meantime, he again became unemployed because of his participation in a strike. In this period, he wrote his first literary pieces. Alexander Abusch, an editor for the Ruhr-Echo supported him and published his initial piece. After 1924, he published in the Communist newspapers the Rote Fahne (Red Banner) and the Rote Front. In 1929, he was invited along with a number of other journalists and writers to visit the Soviet Union. In 1930, he published his first book Sturm auf Essen, reporting on the fighting in the Ruhr Area in 1920. After the seizure of power by the Nazis in 1933, he fled to Switzerland, but was expelled by 1934. Until 1935 he worked for the Communist Party in the French occupied Saarland and fought as an officer in the Spanish Civil War after 1936. In 1938, he attempted to cross from Spain to France but was arrested and detained by the French. In 1941, he succeeded in fleeing to the United States. There he was detained but was later allowed to work in construction and other odd jobs. In 1946 he returned to Germany, first to Stuttgart and then in 1947 to Babelsberg in the Soviet Occupation Zone. He became a founding member of the Academy of the Arts of East Germany. For this action, in 1950 he received the National Prize of East Germany, a prize he received again in 1955 and 1964. He also became a cultural attach√© in Prague in 1950, an office he held until 1955. For his seventieth birthday he gained entrance into the Karl Marx Order and the honorary title of Dr. phil. h.c. from Humboldt University. Marchwitza died on 17 January 1965 at age 75 in Potsdam.  Works  His autobiographical trilogy \\"Die Kumiaks\\" (1934, 1952, 1959) and autobiography \\"Meine Jugend\\" (1947) depict vivid scenes of the life of German working families in Silesia and the Ruhr Area. * Sturm auf Essen (Reportage, 1930) [English translation: Storm Over the Ruhr, Martin Lawrence, 1932] * Walzwerk (Roman, 1932) * Die Kumiaks (Roman, 1934) * Wetterleuchten: Gedichte.

A common measure of the P-O fit is workplace efficacy; the rate at which workers are able to complete tasks. These tasks are mitigated by workplace environs- for example, a worker who works more efficiently as an individual than in a team will have a higher P-O fit for a workplace that stresses individual tasks (such as accountancy). By matching the right personality with the right job, company workers can achieve a better synergy and avoid pitfalls such as high turnover and low job satisfaction. Employees are more likely to stay committed to organizations if the fit is 'good'. In practice, P-O fit would be used to gauge integration with organizational competencies. The Individual is assessed on these competencies, which reveals efficacy, motivation, influence, and co- worker respect. Competencies can be assessed using various tools like psychological tests, assessment centres competency based interview, situational analysis, etc. If the Individual displays a high P-O fit, we can say that the Individual would most likely be able to adjust to the company environment and work culture, and would be able to perform at an optimum level.

He was provost of Paris during the English occupation in the 15th century, and remained a steadfast supporter of the English cause in France throughout his life. Burgundian partisanship A knight and a gentleman, Morhier became involved in the ongoing struggle between the French ruling class for control of the regency of the mad King Charles VI. He became a partisan of the Burgundians against the Armagnacs, and entered into the service of Isabeau of Bavaria (the Queen of France) as butler. After Burgundy's English allies took control of Paris in 1420, Morhier cooperated with the new regime. Upon the accession of the infant King Henry to the French throne in 1422, the French regency was assumed by the child's uncle, John, Duke of Bedford, who enacted policies to acclimate the French to English rule, and appointed Burgundian partisans to positions of power. Chapter 8 Morhier was named provost of Paris by Bedford on 1 December 1422, succeeding Pierre Le Verrat and Jean de La Baume, and holding this post until 1432. He was accused of abusing his functions, and had to testify before the public prosecutor in front of the parliament. Morhier seems to have been involved in diplomatic missions to Aragon. For this, and other services rendered, he received a gift from the French crown on 31 May 1425. It included the lordships of Saint-Piat (which had belonged to his ancestor Guillaume Morhier), Montlouet, and Talvoisin. On 23 July 1430, he is described in a document as lord of M√©nil. On 11 August 1431, he was granted Houdan, whose castle was located in a strategic position. Coat of arms of the Morhier family He fought and was taken prisoner at the failed siege of Montargis in 1427. In February 1429, alongside the English John Fastolf, Morhier led the military escort of a supply convoy destined to the ongoing siege of Orl√©ans, and successfully defended it from a French ambush at the battle of the Herrings. One of the few casualties on the English side included his nephew, and Morhier himself was again captured by the enemy. In September 1429, however, he repulsed an attack by Joan of Arc on Paris. In 1432, when the French took Chartres by surprise, Morhier unsuccessfully tried to recapture it. In 1433 or 1434, Morhier was made captain of Montlh√©ry. He campaigned in the Cotentin in 1435. Career after 1435 After the Duke of Burgundy abandoned the alliance with England by signing the Treaty of Arras (1435), Morhier remained faithful to the English party. He was once more taken prisoner at the bridge of Charenton in 1436, when the French took Paris. His custodian, a certain Denis de Chailly, released him in return for the lordships of Mesnil-Aubry and Montanglaut, and Morhier was allowed to leave the French capital alongside the rest of the English garrison and their French loyalists. Henry VI of England gave Morhier a generous pension and a series of important offices. On 24 June 1437, he was appointed a member of the king's Grand Council of France and Normandy, and from March 1438 to November 1445 or February 1446 Morhier was treasurer of France and Normandy. He became captain of Dreux, La Roche-Guyon (1440), and Saint-L√¥ (1445), and assisted in the defence of Meaux (1439), of Creil and of Pontoise (1441). As part of a series of confrontations leading to the rupture of the truce of Tours (1444‚Äì1449), Morhier was captured on 25 February 1449 at Torcy-le-Grand in a raid conducted by the French garrison of nearby Dieppe. It happened in the middle of a meeting between English partisans, of which Morhier was present. He died in captivity between 4 July 1449 and 31 October 1452, a date when his wife is described as a widow. Family Simon Morhier was the son of √âtienne Morhier (died after 20 August 1395) by his wife Gauch√®re La Verni√®re. They married perhaps in about 1385‚Äì1389. Morhier married firstly Blanche de Popincourt, lady of Mesnil-Aubry (died 10 December 1422), in about 1420. They had one son: * Jean Morhier, who in 1458 married Jeanne de Bretagne, illegitimate daughter of Francis I, Duke of Brittany. The couple had a daughter, Marguerite Morhier, who on 16 November 1495 married Jean Vipart, and had issue. His second marriage was to Jeanne de Laigny, or Lagny (died before 28 April 1436), in about 1425. They had a daughter: * Isabelle Morhier (aft. 1425‚Äìaft. 1506), who married Guy II le Bouteiller and had issue. A certain descendant of Isabelle named Catherine de Baillon has a recorded presence on French Canada in the 17th century, and through her, many people in North America can claim descent from Simon Morhier. Morhier's third and last marriage was to Catherine de Gavre d'Escornaix (aft. 1385‚Äìbef. 1472), between 4 January and 9 April 1440 at La Roche-Guyon, at around the same time Morhier was appointed to the captaincy of that location. The union remained childless. Catherine de Gavre d'Escornaix was the mother of Guy II le Bouteiller from her first marriage with Guy I le Bouteiller. Who was the husband of Simon Morhier's daughter Isabelle Morhier. Also Simon Morhier and Catherine de Gavre d'Escornaix would be the grandparents of Isabelle Morhier's son Jean de le Bouteilli√®re, Lord of Boissi√®re who was the great great great grandfather of Catherine de Baillon through her father Alphonse de Baillon's mother Renee Maillard.

Part of the Dungeons & Dragons series. It was a published adventure meant for those who were playing in Dungeons & Dragons's fantasy role-playing game Planescape campaign setting, also published by TSR.  Synopsis  The culmination of several adventures leading up to that point, The Faction War brought an end to the factions' control of the city. Instigated by the power-hungry Duke Rowan Darkwood, factol of the Fated, in a bid to dethrone the Lady of Pain and rule Sigil himself, the war spread throughout the city before the Lady of Pain, with the aid of a group of adventurers (the players' characters), intervened.  Results of the Faction War  In the Dragon Magazine #315 (January 2004) the result of the Faction War were as follows: * The Believers of the Source, the Mercykillers, and the Sign of One were wiped out in the fighting, while the Bleak Cabal, the Dustmen, the Free League, the Society of Sensation, the Transcendent Order, and the Xaositects disbanded (although many former members continue to hold the same beliefs as they did under faction rule). The six remaining factions chose to leave Sigil behind. All former faction leaders gave up their claims to control over the city, handing it over to elected civil servants. * The Mercykillers were forced to split into two much smaller groups, the Sons of Mercy and the Sodkillers‚Äîtwo smaller factions which long ago joined to form the Mercykillers. The Sons of Mercy are concerned with redeeming and rehabilitating criminals, whereas the Sodkillers believe in simply exterminating them. Both remained in Sigil. * The survivors of the Believers of the Source and the Sign of One merged into a completely new faction known as the Mind's Eye. * The Athar fled the city to the base of the Spire, the region of the Outlands where all magic (including that of the gods) fails, to escape the wrath of the deities whom they defied. Their membership has declined due to the isolation of their new base. * The Doomguard was decimated in the Faction War. Most of its survivors fled to the four Inner Planar citadels maintained by the faction on the borders of the Negative Energy Plane. The Doomguard now rarely leave their citadels, making forays outside only when some great act of creation (such as the formation of a new demiplane) demands a retributive act of destruction. * The Fraternity of Order relocated to the plane of Mechanus, where they already had several strongholds. The Guvners continue to delve into the laws of the planes and plot their eventual return to Sigil, which they still believe to be the fulcrum around which all worlds turn. * The planar chapter of the Harmonium relocated to the plane of Arcadia. They have become less of a police force and more of a diplomatic body. The Harmonium now believes that the best way to spread order is to peacefully unite the Upper Planes under the banner of law rather than forced conversion to their ideals. * The Fated suffered a great loss of face because it was their factol, Duke Darkwood, who started the Faction War in the first place.

It is located in the Tauber valley at the foothills of the Odenwald and the quiet forests of the Spessart on the banks of the Tauber river near the mouth of the Tauber into the Main river. Reicholzheim had 1,450 inhabitants in 2003.  Description and location  It is located in the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg near the most northern point of that state. Located in the beautiful Tauber Valley in a historical area between the picturesque old town of Wertheim and the monastery of Bronnbach. Reicholzheim is part of the Franconian region of Baden- W√ºrttemberg and became a part of Baden only through political manoeuvres in 1806. The landscape of Tauber Franconia has been split since that time between Bavaria and Baden.  History Early history= \\"All indications suggest Reicholzheim was a community by the 8th and 9th Century\\", according to Reicholzheim - √Ñltestes Dorf im unteren Taubertal by Dr. Paul Benz, 1984 (written in German). It may be that Reicholzheim is even older because excavations show evidence that dates back to the 5th century AD. Reicholzheim is first mentioned in a document of 1178 as Richolfsheim. Bishop Reinhard von W√ºrzburg confirms that the Cistercian abbey Bronnbach lies in the area of the Parish of Reicholzheim. Reicholzheim received the place name either from the knight Richolt or from Richulf, the Archbishop of Mainz (in office 787-813). =Reicholzheim in the Middle Ages= In the Middle Ages Reicholzheim had different names: Reicholtsheim, Reichelsheim, Richolfsheim and Richolvesheim. The village then belonged to the land of the count of Wertheim. In 1369 Reicholzheim became part of the lands of the monastery in Bronnbach. There were three other villages beside Reicholzheim that also belonged to Bronnbach. Reicholzheim was * 1573‚Äì1622 Catholic * 1622‚Äì1628 Lutheran * 1628‚Äì1631 Catholic * 1631‚Äì1634 Lutheran * 1635‚Äì1647 Catholic * 1648‚Äì1674 Lutheran * 1674‚Äì1803 Catholic The first entry in the baptisimal book of recatholized Reicholzheim is from April 25, 1674. Today the majority of people in Reicholzheim remain Catholic. In the 12th century the village was subordinated to the county village of the Wertheimer count. After the establishment of the monastery at Bronnbach in the year 1151 Reicholzheim is mentioned as a monastery village. Thus everything in Reicholzeim belongs to the monastery Bronnbach in the year 1285 of count Rudolf. By the sales of the road court in the 1369 also the last right of the Wertheimer count turned everything into the monastery Bronnbach, so that Reicholzheim was now fully subordinate to the monastery of Bronnbach. During the reformation in 1524, Reicholzheim ignored the Reicholzheimer, for 150 years again in came into the possession of the count in Wertheim and thus began an alternation of denomination from Catholic to Evangelist 7 times. Thus the sovereignty over Reicholzheim in the Middle Ages changed again and again between the count von Wertheim and the monastery Bronnbach that to the diocese of Wuerzburg. The lay administration offices of the monastery were accommodated, so e.g. in Reicholzheim the tax collection place of the Wuerzburg diocese. Starting from the 16th century the viticulture of Reicholzheim was of great importance. This was above all the Bronnbachern monks doing, which affected the culture of the village in religious and mental regard. Thus the monastery promoted the viticulture and the agriculture in Reicholzheim and operated in addition in Bronnbach a brewery, brennerei and a mill. =Reicholzheim in the 19th and 20th centuries= Reicholzheim belonged until 1803 to the (Zisterzienser) monastery of Bronnbach. This was the feudal system and all inhabitants had to work for the feudal lords. The monks as other village people had to work for their aristocratic masters. Bronnbach which is and was just to the south of Reicholzheim had under its rule at least three other villages. Bronnbach is still existence today, and has a huge ancient castle-like monastery, now home of a big historical archive of Baden. Bronnbach itself belonged at a certain time to the Bistum of Wuerzburg, which was a big and important \\"state?\\" in Germany at that time. Also there was a big rivalry between Bistum of Wuerzburg and the Bistum of Mainz. Mainz was very active in the area and had some influence in Bronnbach. Beside these church states and areas the very small place of Wertheim which was to the north, reigned by a Count, This political administration played a role, but never regained control over Bronnbach and Reicholzheim after the loss of the villages in Thirty Year War. In 1803 the Old German Reich ceased to exist, the church states were extinguished, and Wertheim and Reicholzheim after three years of interregnum both came to the grand duke of Baden. Up to 1927 the village had had only ten wells, which then were replaced by a modern water supply system. From the 1950s to 1970s, the agricultural character of the village changed into a more and more industrially structured area. In 1951 the wine-growers-cooperative was founded. The vineyards of Reicholzheim are about 25 hectares. The wine-growing village Reicholzheim (7 km). There you can visit the wine market and the wine gallery. As a welcome drink you get a glass of Secco and if your lucky, a short visit to the cellars you may taste three Tauberfranken wines. Objects of interest Reicholzheim possesses several objects of interest, under it also the largest stone cross collection in Germany and is a place of cultivation of wine in the Tauber Valley. =Stone cross collection= The stone cross collection in Reicholzheim is the largest well-known accumulation of stone cross collection of Germany with 14 stone crosses, which are from sandstone, The crosses are embedded in a red sandstone retaining wall, on the old road way between Reicholzheim and Bronnbach. Eight of the stone crosses are engraved with different indications / symbols: Swords, Dolchmesser, hammer, Lillie and a jug or a port up. Beside the stone crosses a bildstock (prayer column) is from the year 1722. thumb Around the stone cross collection the following legend has come about.: a beautiful girl is to have been killed near the roadway, the boy that killed her survived, he went to Gamburg, where he killed himself. His family had the cross made to prevent a bloody revenge from the family of the girl. Historically the stone crosses were from different places in Reicholzheim, they were gathered and were then set up and the wall built. In a village order of 1494 the stone crosses are first mentioned, so that it may be assumed, that at this time already a first accumulation of crosses were to be found there. Generally the stone crosses are from between the 14th and 16th centuries. =Saint George Catholic Church= The Catholic Church in Reicholzheim The old Church of St. George was probably established 1673 or 1674. Tho it is reported that Reicholzheim was Catholic as early as 1573. In 1711 the church of Reicholzheim was established under the Abbot of Joseph Hartmann in the years 1711 -1713. (The Abbot of the Church was likely selected by the Monks at Bronnbach)?. The builder was Johann Josef GREISING of Wu(e)rzburg. In the year 1903 the building was extended under the Priest Martin Noe and 43 meter, high, church tower was built. The baroque altars were built by master carpenter, Balthasar Esterbauer of Wu(e)rzburg, and they are particularly worth seeing. Also on the west side of the Church statues of St. George, made by Sculptor Johann Thomas MUELLER of Freudenberg Also a \\"Bildstock\\" or praying column which contains an image of a holy figure. The Bildstocks are registered usually in maps, and so that represents an important orienting point. Very common in areas like Franconia and Swabia. Reicholzheim was from 1573 - 1622 Catholic 1622 - 1628 Evangelist 1628 - 1631 Catholic 1631 - 1634 Evangelist 1635 - 1647 Catholic 1648 - 1674 Evangelist 1674 - today the majority of people in Reicholzheim are Catholic. That is because Reicholzheim belonged either alternating to the monastery Bronnbach (Roman Catholic) or to the counts von Wertheim (Evangelical ) The first entry in the oldest baptizing book of St. Georg, Catholic Church in Reicholzheim built in 1673, comes from 25.4.1674. =Chapel and the war memorial= The Dreifaltigkeits Chapel was established to 1893‚Äì1894 by Adam Umert with the assistance of several village inhabitants and stands exactly next to the war memorial on the mountain, from which one can grasp the whole village. The chapel is built from the red sandstone found in Reicholzheim. The war memorial makes a wonderful view on the place and the Tauber Valley from Reicholzheim. In 1932 under the direction of the Krieger Kamerad Schaft, the War Memorial was built with two engraved red sandstone boards standing with the names of the people from Reicholzheim who died in World War I and World War II. Public mechanisms and village lives Reicholzheim possesses a primary school (primary school Reicholzheim) and a kindergarten, a community center, in which the local administration, a general physician and a fire-brigade are accommodated. Reicholzheim possesses a festival hall, in which has a capacity of 500 people; also it possesses two sports fields with 100 m course and far jump course and a race course. Reicholzheim has several associations, Sportverein (VfB Reicholzheim), Faschingsverein (RNC Reicholzheim), An association for local history There is a history club (Heimatverein) in Reicholzheim, There are two local history books Paul Benz's book Reicholzheim - ÔøΩltestes Dorf im unteren Taubertal (1984), and Reicholzheim- Blut und Boden (1938) by Fridolin Bischof. A fishing rod association, a Gesangsverein (Saengerkranz Reicholzheim) Motorsportclub (MSC Reicholzheim). There are several association celebrations due to the high number of associations. The most important meetings are: The carnival stranger meetings of the RNCs, The wine celebration, with which there are regional wines auto+free Sunday, every 2 years in the lower Tauber Valley to 2. Sunday in August in Reicholzheim with a celebration involved. Weihnachtsmarkt, with which there are regional products to buy. Nearby In the forests of Reicholzheim, there are mainly oak trees, beech trees, Douglas fir and black pine trees. All together there are more than 30 different kinds of tree. Also rare kinds, such as \\"Speierling\\", which is a type of a wild apple tree, that is used for making apple cider. And very old types of wild fruits are found as well. About half of the forest retains softwood, the other half hardwood. There are about of forest that belong to Reicholzheim. Woods with approximately 126,000 trees. The oak trees are up to 160 years old, and the oldest pine trees are 140 years old. Tauber Bridge Reicholzheim/ Tauberbr√ºcke Reicholzheim was completed in 1772. It is located Reicholzheim, Wertheim, Main-Tauber-Kreis, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. It is an \\"Arch Road\\" bridge made of stone. The dimensions of the spans are 6.048 m - 8.658 m - 6.346 m - 5.318 m. Also interesting is the newly built observatory. Economics Reicholzheim has several company enterprises among them: *Oxygen work Friedrich Gutroff GmbH, which manufacture industrial gases and oxygen. *TFA Dostmann, which manufacture thermometers and digital weather stations *PRACTICE GmbH & PRACTICE Medical GmbH, which fiber thermometer and blood pressure apparatuses manufacturer Beyond that also tourism became a crucial factor of the economy in Reicholzheim, which increased lovely Tauber valley \\"by the wheel drive\\" in the last years having increased. Reicholzheim also has some glass blowing enterprises, a furniture factory and the winegrowers' co- operative.http://www.weingut-schloer.de/ Reicholzheim also has a branch office to the area winegrowers' co-operative Franconia (GWF).

Along many coastlines, the Moon contributes the major part (67%) of the combined lunar and solar tides. The exact interval between tides is influenced by the position of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth, as well as the specific location on Earth where the tide is being measured. Due to the Moon's orbital prograde motion, it takes a particular point on the Earth (on average) 24 hours and 50.5 minutes to rotate under the Moon, so the time between high lunar tides fluctuates between 12 and 13 hours. A tide clock is divided into two roughly 6 hour tidal periods that shows the average length of time between high and low tides in a semi-diurnal tide region, such as most areas of the Atlantic Ocean. Traditional mechanical tide clocks The bottom of the tide clock dial (6 o'clock position) is marked \\"low tide\\" and the top of the tide clock dial (12 o'clock position) is marked \\"high tide.\\" The left side of the dial is marked \\"hours until high tide\\" and has a count-down of hours from 5 to 1. There is one hand on the clock face, and along the left side it points to the number of hours \\"until\\" the (lunar) high tide. The right hand side of the clock is marked \\"hours until low tide\\" and has a count-down of hours from 5 to 1. The number pointed to by the hand gives the time \\"until\\" the (lunar) low tide. Some tide clocks incorporate time (using standard quartz movement) and even humidity and temperature in the same instrument. Some tide clocks count down the number of hours from high or low tide, as in \\"one hour past high or low tide\\". When the clock reaches the half way point (\\"half- tide\\"), it then counts the hours up to high tide or low tide, as in \\"one hour until high or low tide\\". Generally, there is an adjustment knob on the back on the instrument which may be used to set the tide using official tide tables for a specific location at either high or low tide. Tides have an inherent lead or lag, known as the lunitidal interval, that is different at every location, so tidal clocks are set for the time when the local lunar high tide occurs. This is often complicated because the lead or lag varies during the course of the lunar month, as the lunar and solar tides fall into and out of synchronization. The lunar tide and solar tide are synchronized (ebb and flow at the same time) near the full moon and the new moon. The two tides are unsynchronized near the first and last quarter moon (or \\"half moon\\"). Also, in addition to the relative position of the moon and the elliptical pattern of the sun, the tide can be affected to some degree by wind and atmospheric pressure. All of these variables have less impact on the tide at the time of the full moon, so this is usually the best time to set a tide clock. If the tide clock is mounted on a moving boat, it will need to be reset more frequently. The best time to set the clock is at the new moon or the full moon, which is also when the clock can most reliably indicate the actual combined tide. A simple tide clock will always be least reliable near the quarter moon. Tide range is the vertical distance between the highest high tide and lowest low tide. The size of the lunar tide compared to the solar tide (which comes once every 12 hours) is generally about 2 to 1, but the actual proportion along any particular shore depends on the location, orientation, and shape of the local bay or estuary. Along some shorelines, the solar tide is the only important tide, and ordinary 12-hour clocks suffice since the high and low tides come at nearly the same time every day. Because ordinary tidal clocks only track a part of the tidal effect, and because the relative size of the combined effects is different in different places, they are in general only partially accurate for tracking the tides. Consequently, all navigators use tide tables either in a booklet, computer or digital tide clock. Analog tide clocks are most accurate for use on the Atlantic coasts of America and Europe. This is because along the Atlantic coastline the moon controls the tides predictably, ebbing and flowing on a regular (12- to 13-hour) schedule. However, in other parts of the world such as along the Pacific Coast, tides can be irregular. The Pacific Ocean is so vast that the moon cannot control the entire ocean at once. The result is that parts of the Pacific Coast can have 3 high tides a day. Similarly, there are areas in the world like the Gulf of Mexico or the South China Sea that have only one high tide a day. Mechanical tide clocks used on the Pacific Coast must be adjusted frequently, often as much as weekly, and are not useful in diurnal areas (those with one tide per day).Why are Time and Tide Clocks Best Used on the Atlantic Coast?, Weems & Plath Digital tide clocks Digital tide clocks are not married to the 24 hour 50.5 minute tide cycle and thus track tides beyond the Atlantic coast. Smart digital tide clocks can work across all locations in North America without any adjustments. This is achieved by storing all the variations of tides at numerous locations. Given a particular location and date/time, a digital tide clock can display the previous tide, next tide and current absolute tide height. Thus, they are able to track semi-diurnal, diurnal and mixed diurnal tides. Public clocks with tide indications ; Belgium *Lier. The Zimmer tower's astronomical clock has twelve dials surrounding a central clockface. The dial at position X indicates the tides at Lier: the flag without a pennant, at the top of the dial, indicates high water; the flag with a pennant above indicates rising water, the flag with a pennant below indicates ebbing water. The size of the ships indicates the level of the tide. ; France *F√©camp. The clock of 1667 at F√©camp Abbey shows the time of local high tide, and the present state of the sea by means of a disc with a quarter-circle aperture which rotates with the lunar phase, revealing a green background at the syzygies (at new moon and full moon), when the tidal range is most extreme (\\"spring tides\\"), and a black background at times of smaller tidal range (\\"neap tides\\"). ; Netherlands *Arnemuiden. The 16th-century church clock at Arnemuiden indicates the time of local high tide as a pointer on a 12-hour clockface. *Maassluis. Jacob Venker's tide clock on the exterior of the was installed in 1996. Despite the clock's traditional dial, it is computer-controlled, and accounts for 94 waves in its tidal timekeeping. ; United Kingdom *King's Lynn. The south tower of King's Lynn Minster houses a tide clock, a 20th-century restoration of the original installed by Thomas Tue in 1681, which shows the moon phase and the time of local high tide, indicated by a dragon hand. The dial reads \\"LYNN HIGH TIDE\\" clockwise, but is to be interpreted as a 24-hour dial, with \\"L\\" at the top of the dial as midday and \\"G\\" at the bottom of the dial as midnight. *London. Alunatime at Trinity Buoy Wharf is a tide clock designed by Laura Williams, installed in 2010, which indicates the lunar phase, lunar day and tide cycle using a graphical notation of lights.

Governance Dublin GAA has jurisdiction over the area that is associated with the traditional county of Dublin. There are 9 officers on the Board, including the Cathaoirleach (Chairperson), Se√°n Shanley. The Board is subject to the Leinster GAA Provincial Council. =Notable officers= The following members have also held notable positions in the GAA: *Tom Loftus, former Chairman of the Dublin County Board was appointed Vice Chairman of the GAA Leinster Council (1969‚Äì1972) and later Chairman of the GAA Leinster Council (1972‚Äì1974) *Three men from the Dublin GAA organisation have served as President of the GAA: **Daniel McCarthy, 1921‚Äì1924 **Se√°n Ryan, 1928‚Äì1932 **Dr Joseph Stuart, 1958‚Äì1961 =Clubs= For details on the Board's clubs, see this category and the list of Gaelic games clubs in Ireland#Dublin. =Restructuring= The GAA conducted a review of the structure of the Dublin GAA organisation in 2002 because of the huge population inequities, and investigated the feasibility of dividing the County into more population-appropriate structures. Plans to divide Dublin into two teams ‚Äì North Dublin and South Dublin ‚Äì were proposed in 2002 but rejected by the Dublin County Board. Currently the Board has only decided to divide its development teams. These teams are not considered to be a move towards dividing the county but are in fact a move designed to identify and develop young talent for the County as a whole. The restructured developments teams are North, South and West. Crest and symbols In 2003/4, the Dublin County Board tried unsuccessfully to copyright the Dublin crest in use at the time. The crest at the time was declared to be in the public domain by the Irish High Court as it was too similar to other crests in use by Dublin City Council and other Dublin sports bodies. In line with other county boards and in order to prevent further loss of revenue, the county board designed a new crest drawing from the county's historical past which could be copyrighted and registered as a trade mark. The symbolism of the crest is: three castles in flame which signifies the city of Dublin; a raven which signifies the county of Fingal; a Viking longboat which signifies the county of D√∫n Laoghaire-Rathdown; a book which signifies the county of South Dublin. The name √Åth Cliath in Irish replaces the previous name \\"Dublin\\". Sponsorship In October 2013, Dublin signed a new sponsorship deal with insurance firm AIG in excess of ‚Ç¨4m over a five-year period. The deal would also incorporate ladies' football and camogie for the first time. FootballClubs= The Dublin Senior Football Championship is an annual club competition between the top Dublin clubs. The winners of the Dublin Championship qualify to represent their county in the Leinster Championship and in turn, go on to the All- Ireland Senior Club Football Championship. The current (2015) Dublin County Champions are Ballyboden St Enda's who claimed their first Dublin Senior Championship title. The first winners of the Dublin football championship were Erins Hope in 1887, who were the student club attached to St Patrick's Teacher Training College, Drumcondra. St Vincent's have won the most titles with a total of 26. The Dublin Intermediate Football Championship is the second tier football championship. The Intermediate champions go on to play in the Senior football Championship. The 2012 Dublin Intermediate County Champions are Cuala who became champions with a win over Fingallians. St Brigid's are the most successful intermediate club, having won on five occasions. Parnell Park hosts all the major games in the Dublin club football championships. =County team= Dublin against Tyrone in the 2013 National Football League Final Dublin first won the All-Ireland in 1891 beating Cork by a 2‚Äì1 to 1‚Äì1 margin. They won the All-Ireland the following year with victory over Kerry. The Dublin team of the 1970s won 4 All-Irelands (1974, 1976, 1977 and 1983) and won 7 Leinster titles (6 consecutively). They were also the first team to play in 6 All-Ireland Football Finals consecutively from 1974 to 1979, a feat later matched by Kerry in 2009. In the 2010s, Dublin produced the greatest teams in modern times. The Dubs won 7 championships in the decade and also five in a row, being one of the greatest decade any team can make. On 25 March 2017, when beating Roscommon by 2‚Äì29 to 0‚Äì14 in a National League game at Croke Park, Dublin set a new record of playing 35 games in League and Championship without defeat. The previous record, held by Kerry, had stood for 84 years. Dublin and Meath were involved in one of the most famous of Leinster championship encounters in 1991, the Dublin and Meath 4 consecutive ties. The teams had to go to three replays in their Leinster Senior Football Championship first round match before a winner could be found. This series of games had the added factor of the Dublin and Meath being long standing fierce rivals, a rivalry that was increased due to Meath winning the 4 out of the last 5 Leinster Championships and 2 All-Irelands over the previous 5 years to replace Dublin as the strongest team in Leinster. Meath eventually won the series thanks to a last minute goal scored by Kevin Foley, and a point scored by David Beggy, in the third replay. Foley took seven steps for the winning goal. HurlingClubs= The Dublin Senior Hurling Championship is an annual club competition between the top Dublin clubs. The winners of the Dublin Championship qualify to represent their county in the Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship and in turn, go on to the All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship. The 2013 Dublin County Champions were Ballyboden St. Enda's. The first winners of the Dublin hurling championship were Metropolitans in 1888. Faughs have won the most titles with a total of 31. The (2013) champions of the Dublin Minor Hurling Championship are Ballyboden St Endas. 2014 Champions were Croke's 2015 Champions were Cuala who were runners up in the Leinster Final 2016 Champions are Cuala who won the Leinster Final for the first time since Crumlin 79/80 Parnell Park hosts all the major games in the Dublin club hurling championships. =County team= Liam Rushe in action for the Dublin hurlers against Galway in the Allianz Hurling League Dublin's hurlers have failed to replicate the success of the county's football side, having won the Senior All-Ireland Hurling final on 6 occasions, most recently in 1938. In terms of All-Ireland titles, they are significantly behind hurling's big three of Kilkenny, Cork and Tipperary. Their six titles do however place them fifth in the overall winners list, jointly tied with Wexford. Dublin have won the Leinster Championship on 24 occasions, the second most Leinster titles of any side, although they remain well behind Kilkenny, who have won the Leinster Championship 70 times. Dublin have won the National Hurling League three times: in 1929, 1939 and 2011. This places them joint seventh (with Clare) on the overall winners list, having won 16 fewer titles than top-ranked Tipperary.http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/gaa/ In 2009, former Clare manager, Anthony Daly was appointed manager of Dublin. Under his management, Dublin contested the Leinster Final, but lost by 2 goals to Kilkenny. Dublin won the National Hurling League in May 2011 after a 12-point win over Kilkenny, their first national title since they won the All Ireland in 1938. On 7 July 2013, they won the Leinster Final against Galway on a 2‚Äì25 to 2‚Äì13 scoreline, scoring 2‚Äì21 from play. This was the first time they had won this important competition since 1961.

The former winners for Dublin include M. Joyce 1925, W. McGuire 1927, L. Rowe 1947, 1949 and 1951, P. Ryan 1980 and E. Kennedy 2004, 2005 and 2006. Camogie Dublin are the most successful county in the women's field sport of camogie, During the period from 1932 to 1966 they had nearly one- third of the affiliated clubs in the Association and won all but eight of the championships they contested, winning a ten consecutively and an eight consecutively in a period interrupted only by a controversial 1956 All-Ireland semi-final defeat to Antrim. In a period of revival they won three National Camogie League titles in 1979‚Äì1983 and the 1984 All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship. The total could have been greater had not Dublin County Board disaffiliated during two periods of unrest in the 1940s. Three Dublin clubs have won the All-Ireland Senior Club Camogie Championship, Austin Stacks (1971 and 1972), Eoghan Ruadh (1967), and Crumlin (1985). =Structure= The camogie structure in Dublin was arguably the most successful in the country and differed from its provincial counterparts. The league and championship were organised in the winter months, and weekly programmes of Dublin Senior Club Camogie League, Dublin Senior Club Camogie Championship and Isle of Man Cup matches were contested by clubs such as Austin Stacks, Celtic, CIE, Cuchulainns, Eoghan Ruadh, Jacobs, Muiris O'Neills, Naomh Aoife, and Optimists on a dedicated camogie ground in the Phoenix Park (first used 1922, reopened 1933, new pitch opened 1987) although Celtic had a ground in Coolock and CIE had a ground in Inchicore. This left Dublin camogie to concentrate on a summer closed season which contributed to its successes in the but led to difficulties when Dublin clubs began to compete in the provincial and All Ireland club championship in the 1960s. Although Celtic were the first winners of the All Ireland, they did not compete the following year. =Notable players= Notable players include team of the century members Eileen Duffy, Sophie Brack, Kay Mills and √öna O'Connor, player of the year award winners Alice Hussey and Yvonne Redmond, All Star award winnersAll-stars on camogie.ie Eimear Brannigan, Ciara Lucey and Louise O'Hara, and stars from the \\"golden age\\" such as Sophie Brack, Emmy Delaney, Kathleen Cody, Peggy Griffin, Doreen Rogers and Mary Walsh. =Administrators= M√°ire N√≠ Chinn√©ide, M√°ire Gill, Eilish Redmond, Nell McCarthy, √öna U√≠ Phuirs√©il, Br√≠d√≠n U√≠ Mhaolag√°in and Phyllis Breslin have served as presidents of the Camogie Association). =Expansion= Under Camogie's National Development Plan 2010‚Äì2015, \\"Our Game, Our Passion\\",Irish Independent 29 March 2010: Final goal for camogie five new camogie clubs were to be established in the county by 2015.National Development Plan 2010‚Äì2015, Our Game, Our Passion information page on camogie.ie, pdf download (778k) from Camogie.ie download site Ladies' footballRivalries In Gaelic football, Dublin's biggest rivalry has been with nearby Meath. Both counties were the strongest sides from Leinster during the 1970s and 1980s. The 1991 four-game tie added to the intensity between the two counties. The Dublin football team also share a rivalry with neighbours Kildare. Lesser local rivalries exist with nearby Wicklow, Laois and Westmeath. On a national level Dublin's rivalry with Kerry is one of Ireland's most renowned. The rivalry between the two counties intensified in the 1970s and early 1980s. Other smaller footballing rivalries have developed over the decades between Dublin and teams such as Cork, Tyrone, Donegal and Galway, who Dublin played in the 1983 Final known as the Game of Shame. The Dublin hurling team share lesser rivalries with fellow provincial sides Kilkenny, Offaly and Wexford.

Anti-ship missiles The Exocet is probably the most famous weapon of the war, sinking two British ships and damaging a third. Operated by both sides the missile was used by the Argentine Navy either air launched from Dassault Super √âtendard jets and from an improvised land launcher. ::See main article Exocet. The Sea Skua was a British light anti-ship missile, fired from Lynx helicopters, its warhead is only 20 kg compared with the Exocet's 165 kg. However, hits from three Sea Skua missiles badly damaged the Argentine ARA Alferez Sobral. ::See main article Sea Skua. The AS.12 was a French built light anti-ship missile, fired from Westland Wasp helicopters. Like the Sea Skua, its small 28 kg warhead meant that it could not destroy ships outright; however, it could disable smaller vessels. On 25 April 1982 it contributed towards damaging and disabling the Argentine Submarine the ARA Santa Fe. A total of nine missiles were fired at the submarine trapped on the surface by anti-submarine torpedoes circling just under the hull. Of the missiles fired four hit, four missed and one failed to launch. Two of the missiles that hit the target failed to detonate on impact, instead punching a hole through the slender conning tower and exploding on the far side. ::See main article AS.12. Surface-to-air missiles Sea Dart was the British naval medium-range surface-to-air missile. It proved unable to engage low-altitude targets, such as Argentine A4 Skyhawk aircraft and Exocet missiles. However, it did achieve several long-range kills. Sea Wolf is a British naval short-range low-altitude surface-to-air missile, used to complement the longer-range Sea Dart. It proved capable of engaging low-flying aircraft. Rapier is a British surface- to-air missile developed for the British Army to replace their towed Bofors 40/L70 anti-aircraft guns. Though not particularly effective in terms of number of 'kills' ‚Äì its presence acted as a deterrent, especially after the deployment of Blind Fire systems around Port San Carlos. Seacat and Tigercat surface-to-air missiles were obsolete by the Falklands War; however, they were used by both sides during the conflict. The optically guided missiles were not effective; no kills can be attributed to the missiles. However, they were able to be used in San Carlos Water, where radar-based systems like Sea Dart and Sea Wolf could not operate. Argentine land forces had a total of 7 Tigercat missile launchers (Ex RAF); there were several near misses, and possibly one Sea Harrier had its engine damaged by shrapnel from one of the missiles. Sea Slug, a long range, high altitude anti-aircraft missile system of the 1950s, was not used against aircraft but for bombardment of positions near Port Stanley by the Royal Navy ships equipped with it. The Blowpipe missile is a British built man-portable surface-to-air missile used by both sides during the conflict. It performed poorly; official British reports attributed nine kills to the missile out of 95 fired. However, independent research suggests that only a single kill can be attributed to the British use of the missile, an Aermacchi MB-339 that was shot down at Goose Green on 28 May 1982. Argentine forces shot down a Harrier GR3 on 21 May, probably with a Blowpipe missile fired by Primer Teniente S Fernandez of Commando Company 601 over Port Howard. The system's overall lack of success was probably due to the amount of operator input required to successfully hit a target. British SAS special forces had acquired 6 American-made Stinger missiles; however, the soldier trained to use the missile was killed in a helicopter crash. By luck the first missile fired managed to bring down a Pucar√° on 21 May; however, the lack of training meant that a further five missiles fired that day did not hit their targets. Argentine forces used Soviet-made SA-7 Grail man portable missiles. A Roland missile being launched during American tests on the system Roland was a European short-range surface-to-air missile. Argentine forces deployed a single launcher to defend Stanley airport; it succeeded in shooting down one Sea Harrier (XZ456) on 1 June 1982 above 10,000 feet (3000 m). The presence of the launcher forced British aircraft to operate above its envelope ‚Äì typically at 18,000 feet (5,500 m) which severely reduced the accuracy of bombs dropped on the airport. The single Roland unit was later shipped back to Britain for analysis and testing. Anti-aircraft guns Argentine forces deployed a substantial number of anti-aircraft guns around Stanley and Goose Green airfields. These included some 15 Rheinmetall 20 mm/75 anti-aircraft guns, approximately 20 Hispania Suiza 30 mm guns, 15 Oerlikon GDF-002 35 mm twin cannons with 6 Skyguard fire control radars, as well as one older Super Fledermaus fire control system. Aircraft and weapons ::See Sea Harrier, A-4 Skyhawk, IAI Dagger, C130 Hercules, Dassault Super √âtendard, Mirage III :: The AIM-9 Sidewinder in its L form was the Harrier's air-to-air missile. It claimed 20 Argentine aircraft. By comparison, the FAA had the French Matra R530 missile Artillery and armour British forces were equipped with the 105 mm L118 light gun as their main artillery and the Scimitar and Scorpion armoured reconnaissance vehicles. The Argentine Marines used LVTP-7 and LARC-5 vehicles in their initial amphibious assault with all of them returning to the mainland shortly after. During the subsequent reinforcement of the islands defences, the Argentine Army deployed two artillery groups with OTO Melara Mod 56 105 mm guns and later airlifted four CITER L33 Guns 155 mm in order to repel the British naval gun fire. Twelve Panhard AML-90 wheel vehicles were also stationed within Stanley.

It specifically refers to the pilgrimage of tens of thousands of Hasidim to the city of Uman, Ukraine,In first, Israel sets up temporary consulate in Uman for Rosh Hashanah, The Times of Israel (29 August 2018) (annually 40,000 Jews, nearly entirely men visit Uman) but also refers to sizable Rosh Hashana gatherings of Breslover Hasidim in other locales around the world. In recent years the pilgrimage to Uman has attracted Jewish seekers from all levels of religious observance and affiliation, including introducing Sephardic Jews to Hasidic spirituality. This has added to Breslov's position in the Baal teshuva movement of Jewish outreach. Hasidic pilgrims and local Uman residents annually come into conflict. Rosh Hashana with Rebbe Nachman The first Rosh Hashana kibbutz was initiated by Rebbe Nachman of Breslov during his lifetime. He strongly encouraged his followers to spend each Rosh Hashana with him in the town of Breslov. Hundreds of followers would gather for the holiday prayer service, festive meals, and special Torah lessons taught by the Rebbe. When asked why Rosh Hashana was so significant, Rebbe Nachman explained, \\"My Rosh Hashana is greater than everything. I cannot understand how it is that if my followers really believe in me, they are not all scrupulous about being with me for Rosh Hashana. No one should be missing! Rosh Hashana is my whole mission.\\"Tzaddik #403. To one follower who said he preferred to visit the Rebbe on the Shabbat after Rosh Hashana, when he would have more space to pray, eat and sleep, the Rebbe replied, \\"Whether you eat or don't eat; whether you sleep or don't sleep; whether you pray or don't pray (i.e. with the proper concentration); just make sure to be with me for Rosh Hashana, no matter what!\\"Tzaddik #404. Elsewhere, Rebbe Nachman explained that traveling to a tzaddik on Rosh Hashana is a time-honored practice which helps to mitigate and \\"sweeten\\" Heavenly decrees at their source, at the beginning of the new year.Kramer, Crossing the Narrow Bridge, p. 363. The Rebbe also mentioned before the last Rosh Hashana of his life (in 1810) that there were people who were unable to achieve their tikkun (self-rectification) all year, nor was he able to help them then. On Rosh Hashana, however, these tikkunim could be effected.Tzaddik #406. In 1843, on the last Rosh Hashana of his own life, Nathan of Breslov (\\"Reb Noson\\"), the Rebbe's closest disciple and leader of the movement after the Rebbe's death, expounded on the meaning of Rebbe Nachman's Rosh Hashana in this way: > We see that on Rosh Hashana, Jews flock to the synagogue, to their leaders. > They come from all the towns and villages to be together on Rosh Hashana. > This is because the Jewish People are likened to a flock of sheep who gather > around their shepherd. When the shepherd wishes to call his flock, he blows > his horn. This is the reason for the blowing of the shofar on Rosh Hashana. > The shepherd, the true tzaddik, is calling his \\"flock\\" together, seeking > ways to help each one of them fulfill his destiny.\\"Likutey Halachos, Netilas > Yadayim 6:89, quoted in Kramer, Through Fire and Water, p. 512. Rebbe Nachman died in October 1810 and was buried in the Uman cemetery. Afterwards, Reb Noson explained to the other Hasidim that Rebbe Nachman had stressed the importance of the Rosh Hashana kibbutz that year because he wanted them to continue to \\"be with him\\" for the holiday even after his death. He encouraged them to continue to gather at the Rebbe's gravesite in Uman every Rosh Hashana. Pilgrimage established by Reb Noson Reb Noson arranged the first Rosh Hashana kibbutz the following year (1811) and continued to run it until his death in 1844. In the following decades, hundreds of Hasidim arrived annually from Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania and Poland. So many joined the pilgrimage, in fact, that the local synagogue was unable to accommodate them. Fearing that people would stop attending the kibbutz, Reb Noson acquired a property, applied for a government permit, raised funds and oversaw the construction of a large Breslover synagogue in Uman in 1834. Known as the kloyz, it housed the annual Rosh Hashana kibbutz through the 1930s. Reb Noson once said, \\"Even if the road to Uman were paved with knives, I would crawl there -- just so I could be with my Rebbe on Rosh Hashanah!\\"Tovot Zichronot, p. 137. In each generation, the most pious representatives of the movement were honored with leading the prayer services at the annual Rosh Hashana kibbutz. They included: Nachman Chazan, Abraham Sternhartz, Levi Yitzchok Bender, Michel Dorfman, and Itzel Korsinski. The annual Rosh Hashana pilgrimage effectively redirected the focus of Breslover Hasidut from the town of Breslov to the town of Uman. Today, the town of Breslov is considered a side-trip for visitors to Ukraine, as the only sites of interest to Breslover Hasidim there are the graves of Reb Noson and other Breslover figures. Pilgrimage in the Soviet Union The Rosh Hashana pilgrimage ground to a halt with the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, which sealed the border between Russia and Poland. Uman became a \\"closed city\\" and foreigners were strictly prohibited from entering. Rabbi Yitzchok Breiter, a Breslover Hasid in Poland who drew thousands of his countrymen closer to the Hasidut in the 1920s and 1930s, established a Rosh Hashana kibbutz in Lublin for their benefit. Hasidim who emigrated to Israel established Rosh Hashana kibbutzim in Jerusalem and in Meron (the latter at the gravesite of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai), which continue to this day. Later, other Rosh Hashana kibbutzim were established in New York City and in Manchester, England. Shmuel Horowitz, a native of Safed, Mandate Palestine, was the last foreign citizen to sneak across the Polish border into the Soviet Union around 1929. He participated in three Rosh Hashana kibbutzim in Uman before he was discovered and arrested for illegal entry. After spending three months in a Soviet prison, Horowitz was released with the intervention of the Chief Rabbi of Mandate Palestine, Abraham Isaac Kook, and returned in 1933. Despite the Communist ban on public prayer gatherings, Breslover Hasidim in the Soviet Union continued to gather clandestinely every Rosh Hashana during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1934, the Soviets ostensibly granted permission for 28 Hasidim to travel to Uman for Rosh Hashana. In fact, it was a ruse to discover their identities -- 16 were murdered while still in Uman and 12 were exiled to Siberia. Only four of the exiles survived. In 1936, the authorities shut down the kloyz built by Reb Noson and turned it into a metalworking factory. The Rosh Hashana kibbutz was relocated to a rented apartment in 1936 and 1937. The last kibbutz before World War II was held in 1938. Twenty-seven Hasidim risked their lives to participate in this gathering. World War II and the Holocaust decimated the numbers of Breslover Hasidim living in the Soviet Union. The Rosh Hashana pilgrimage resumed on a drastically smaller scale in 1948, when 11 Hasidim independently traveled from cities throughout the Soviet Union to Uman for Rosh Hashana. From then until the 1970s, when most of the remaining Hasidim were permitted to emigrate to Israel, only between 9 and 13 Hasidim braved the annual trip. They were often forced to change the location of their prayer services from year to year to escape discovery by the authorities. Beginning in the 1950s, Michel Dorfman in Moscow became the official organizer of the Rosh Hashana kibbutz. Hasidim from throughout the Soviet Union would contact him for details about each year's event, and he wrote letters to others, encouraging them to continue this practice of being with Rebbe Nachman for Rosh Hashana despite the long journey and the threat of government surveillance. In the 1960s, when the majority of Hasidim in the Breslover movement resided outside the Soviet Union, Rebbe Nachman's gravesite began to turn from being an internal Russian destination to an international one. A young New York Hasid named Gedaliah Fleer was the first foreign citizen to enter Uman without permission in 1963, with Dorfman's help. The Soviets would only issue tourist visas to larger cities like Kiev and Odessa, not to Uman. Fleer returned to Uman in 1965 to join the Rosh Hashana kibbutz with 12 other Soviet Hasidim. Fleer pretended to be from the Soviet Republic of Georgia and that he did not speak Yiddish or Russian in order to protect his identity. Had the participants known that a foreign citizen was in their midst, they would have quit the kibbutz immediately.Fleer, Against All Odds, p. 156. From the 1960s until the end of the Cold War 1989, several hundred American and Israeli Hasidim made their way to Uman, both legally and illegally, to pray at the grave of Rebbe Nachman. Sometimes the government issued individual tourist visas to Uman, but no one was allowed to stay in the city overnight. In 1975, however, Rabbi Herschel Wasilski, the official American representative of Breslover Hasidut, received permission to conduct a minyan at the Rebbe's gravesite on the eve of Rosh Hashana with 11 other men and spent the holiday in the city. In 1988, glasnost and continuing international pressure finally forced the Soviet government to permit 250 foreign citizens to stay in Uman over Rosh Hashana. Pilgrimage since the end of the Cold War In 1989 the end of the Cold War opened the gates entirely. Between 700 and 900 Hasidim gathered in Uman for Rosh Hashana 1989. In 1990, 2,000 Hasidim attended. Large factory sites were called into service to house the crowd. The numbers have continued to grow apace. The Rosh Hashana kibbutz in Uman surpassed the 10,000-person mark in 2000. In 2005, approximately 20,000 men and boys from all countries and all backgrounds converged on the town for the annual event. In 2008, the numbers reached 25,000.\\"Hasidic Jews celebrate holiday in Uman\\" Jewish Telegraphic Agency, 2008-10-02. Retrieved 2009-07-31. In 2018 40,000 Jews, nearly entirely men, visit Uman. Coordinators of the Rosh Hashana kibbutz fly in fully catered, kosher holiday meals for all participants, temporary lodgings, an infirmary and emergency medical technicians from Israel.Uman Emergency Clinic home page. Despite the dormitory-style accommodations, the gathering is infused with much spiritual devotion and unity of purpose. Besides the communal prayer services, Torah classes are conducted in Yiddish, Hebrew, English, Russian, and French. A visual highlight of the Rosh Hashana kibbutz is the Tashlikh ceremony, held on the afternoon of the first day of the holiday (if the first day of Rosh Hashana falls on Shabbat, Tashlikh is postponed to the second day of Rosh Hashana). Thousands of Hasidim, dressed entirely in white, sing and dance through the streets of Uman as they make their way down to the river to perform this holiday ritual. In September 2014, a statement issued by the association of Breslov rabbis called on women to cease visiting the gravesite because the presence of women could detract from the sacredness of prayers said by male worshippers. According to the statement the increasing presence of women has created a \\"huge spiritual interruption.\\" Others defend their position stating that the enormous volume of male worshippers would mitigate the possibility of proper separation of the genders. They say that this separation is necessary to stay focused on the sacred mission of the pilgrimage. In recent years there has been frequent friction between the predominantly Israeli Hasidic pilgrims and Uman locals, many of whom resent the cordoning off of neighborhoods by police the internal trade that has develops among pilgrims. Street brawls are not uncommon. Source at Ben Gurion airport have also complained about Hasidic pilgrim ‚Äúpassengers who arrive to the plane drunk, or even drugged\\". Anshel Pfeffer reported (for Haaretz) in 2018 that an Israeli diplomat told him that \\"roughly only half of those who come to Uman do so for religious reasons, and the other half are simply the dregs who come to get drunk, take drugs and visit prostitutes,\\" Pfeffer himself did not find any evidence of prostitution in Uman.My Pilgrimage Into the Jewish Future: Partying, Praying, Prostitution and Absolution in Uman, Haaretz (15 September 2018) In September 2010, ten Hasidic pilgrims were deported back to Israel and banned from Ukraine for five years for disrupting public order and causing bodily harm to citizens.

The work is an extensive treatise on the subject of abjection,Fletcher & Benjamin, \\"Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva\\" (2012), p. 93 in which Kristeva draws on the theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan to examine horror, marginalization, castration, the phallic signifier, the \\"I/Not I\\" dichotomy, the Oedipal complex, exile, and other concepts appropriate to feminist criticism and queer theory. According to Kristeva, the abject marks a \\"primal order\\" that escapes signification in the symbolic order; the term is used to refer to the human reaction (horror, vomit) to a threatened breakdown in meaning caused by the loss of the distinction between subject and object, or between the self and the other. Compared to Lacan Kristeva's understanding of the \\"abject\\" provides a helpful term to contrast to Lacan's objet petit a (or the \\"object of desire\\"). Whereas the objet petit a allows a subject to coordinate his or her desires, thus allowing the symbolic order of meaning and intersubjective community to persist, the abject \\"is radically excluded and,\\" as Kristeva explains, \\"draws me toward the place where meaning collapses\\" (Powers 2). It is neither object nor subject; the abject is situated, rather, at a place before we entered into the symbolic order. (On the symbolic order, see, in particular, the Lacan module on psychosexual development.) As Kristeva puts it, \\"Abjection preserves what existed in the archaism of pre-objectal relationship, in the immemorial violence with which a body becomes separated from another body in order to be\\" (Powers 10). The abject marks what Kristeva terms a \\"primal repression,\\" one that precedes the establishment of the subject's relation to its objects of desire and of representation, before even the establishment of the opposition between consciousness and the unconscious. Kristeva refers, instead, to the moment in our psychosexual development when we established a border or separation between human and animal, between culture and that which preceded it. On the level of archaic memory, Kristeva refers to the primitive effort to separate ourselves from the animal: \\"by way of abjection, primitive societies have marked out a precise area of their culture in order to remove it from the threatening world of animals or animalism, which were imagined as representatives of sex and murder\\" (Powers 12-13). On the level of our individual psychosexual development, the abject marks the moment when we separated ourselves from the mother, when we began to recognize a boundary between \\"me\\" and other, between \\"me\\" and \\"(m)other.\\" (See the Kristeva Module on Psychosexual Development.) The abject is \\"a precondition of narcissism\\" (Powers 13), which is to say, a precondition for the narcissism of the mirror stage, which occur after we establish these primal distinctions. The abject thus at once represents the threat that meaning is breaking down and constitutes our reaction to such a breakdown: a reestablishment of our \\"primal repression.\\" The abject has to do with \\"what disturbs identity, system, order. What does not respect borders, positions, rules\\" (Powers 4) and, so, can also include crimes like Auschwitz. Such crimes are abject precisely because they draw attention to the \\"fragility of the law\\" (Powers 4). Eruption of the Real More specifically, Kristeva associates the abject with the eruption of the Real into our lives. In particular, she associates such a response with our rejection of death's insistent materiality. Our reaction to such abject material recharges what is essentially a pre-lingual response. Kristeva, therefore, is quite careful to differentiate knowledge of death or the meaning of death (both of which can exist within the symbolic order) from the traumatic experience of being actually confronted with the sort of materiality that traumatically shows one's own death: A wound with blood and pus, or the sickly, acrid smell of sweat, of decay, does not signify death. In the presence of signified death‚Äîa flat encephalograph, for instance‚ÄîI would understand, react, or accept. No, as in true theater, without makeup or masks, refuse and corpses show me what I permanently thrust aside in order to live. These body fluids, this defilement, this shit are what life withstands, hardly and with difficulty, on the part of death. There, I am at the border of my condition as a living being. (Powers 3) The corpse especially exemplifies Kristeva's concept since it literalizes the breakdown of the distinction between subject and object that is crucial for the establishment of identity and for our entrance into the symbolic order. What we are confronted with when we experience the trauma of seeing a human corpse (particularly the corpse of a friend or family member) is our own eventual death made palpably real. As Kristeva puts it, \\"The corpse, seen without God and outside of science, is the utmost of abjection. It is death infecting life. Abject\\" (Powers 4 ). Comparison with desire The abject must also be distinguished from desire (which is tied up with the meaning-structures of the symbolic order). It is associated, rather, with both fear and jouissance. In phobia, Kristeva reads the trace of a pre-linguistic confrontation with the abject, a moment that precedes the recognition of any actual object of fear: \\"The phobic object shows up at the place of non-objectal states of drive and assumes all the mishaps of drive as disappointed desires or as desires diverted from their objects\\" (Powers 35 ). The object of fear is, in other words, a substitute formation for the subject's abject relation to drive. The fear of, say, heights really stands in the place of a much more primal fear: the fear caused by the breakdown of any distinction between subject and object, of any distinction between ourselves and the world of dead material objects. Kristeva also associates the abject with jouissance: \\"One does not know it, one does not desire it, one joys in it [on en jouit]. Violently and painfully. A passion\\" (Powers 9 ). This statement appears paradoxical, but what Kristeva means by such statements is that we are, despite everything, continually and repetitively drawn to the abject (much as we are repeatedly drawn to trauma in Freud's understanding of repetition compulsion). To experience the abject in literature carries with it a certain pleasure but one that is quite different from the dynamics of desire. Kristeva associates this aesthetic experience of the abject, rather, with poetic catharsis: \\"an impure process that protects from the abject only by dint of being immersed in it\\" (Powers 29 ). Purifying the abject The abject for Kristeva is, therefore, closely tied both to religion and to art, which she sees as two ways of purifying the abject: \\"The various means of purifying the abject‚Äîthe various catharses‚Äîmake up the history of religions, and end up with that catharsis par excellence called art, both on the far and near side of religion\\" (Powers 17). According to Kristeva, the best modern literature (Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Marcel Proust, Jorge Luis Borges, Antonin Artaud, Louis-Ferdinand C√©line, Franz Kafka, etc.) explores the place of the abject, a place where boundaries begin to break down, where people are confronted with an archaic space before such linguistic binaries as self/other or subject/object. The transcendent or sublime, for Kristeva, is really our effort to cover over the breakdowns (and subsequent reassertion of boundaries) associated with the abject; and literature is the privileged space for both the sublime and abject: \\"On close inspection, all literature is probably a version of the apocalypse that seems to me rooted, no matter what its sociohistorical conditions might be, on the fragile border (borderline cases) where identities (subject/object, etc.) do not exist or only barely so‚Äîdouble, fuzzy, heterogeneous, animal, metamorphosed, altered, abject\\" (Powers 207 ). According to Kristeva, literature explores the way that language is structured over a lack, a want. She privileges poetry, in particular, because of poetry's willingness to play with grammar, metaphor and meaning, thus laying bare the fact that language is at once arbitrary and limned with the abject fear of loss: \\"Not a language of the desiring exchange of messages or objects that are transmitted in a social contract of communication and desire beyond want, but a language of want, of the fear that edges up to it and runs along its edges\\" (Powers 38 ).Felluga, Dino. \\"Modules on Kristeva: On the Abject.\\" Introductory Guide to Critical Theory.

He made 350 appearances and scored 92 goals in the Football League in the 1970s and 1980s, and also played abroad. He was capped twice by England at under-21 level. After retiring as a player he had a lengthy career in management. Playing career King was born in Luton, Bedfordshire, and began his career as an apprentice with his home town side, Luton Town, turning professional in July 1974. He left to join Everton in April 1976 for a fee of ¬£35,000 and became a crowd favourite with his tremendous skills in midfield and a knack for scoring goals. Most notably he scored a spectacular goal to win Everton's first Merseyside derby for seven years in 1978. During this period he won two England under-21 caps, but never played for the national team. He joined Queens Park Rangers in September 1980 for a 400,000 pound fee and made his debut against Sheffield Wednesday. King was the first QPR player to score on the famous 'plastic pitch' in the opening game, although Rangers lost 1‚Äì2 to Luton Town. In all King played 30 league games for QPR scoring 9 goals before a transfer to West Bromwich Albion in September 1981. King returned to Everton in July 1982 for two seasons, subsequently playing for Dutch side Cambuur Leeuwarden then Swedish team √ñrebro SK, before joining Wolverhampton Wanderers in January 1985. He returned to Luton Town in December the same year, but made just three league appearances before moving to Aldershot in August 1986. He retired from the professional game at the end of the following season in May 1987. Overall his league playing career spanned 14 years, in which he scored more than 80 goals across more than 310 league appearances. Coaching and managerial career King was appointed player/manager of Irish top division team Waterford United in January 1989, after Peter Thomas resigned. However, after only two league appearances he left the club by mutual consent seven weeks later. He then signed for Cobh Ramblers as a player. scoring his only League of Ireland goal came on St Patrick's Day against Shamrock Rovers He was appointed as manager of Mansfield Town in August 1993. He led Mansfield to the Third Division play- offs in the 1994‚Äì95 season, losing in the semi-finals to Chesterfield. They failed to build on this the following season and King left in July 1996 after Mansfield had finished in 19th place. He later worked as a coach and a scout, and was scouting for Sunderland when, in the 2000 close season, he joined Swindon Town as assistant manager under his former Everton teammate Colin Todd. In November 2000, after Todd had left to become assistant manager of Derby County, King took over as manager. He maintained Swindon's Second Division status that season, but was replaced by former Liverpool manager Roy Evans in June 2001. Evans remained in charge for just a few months and King was re-appointed as Swindon manager on 20 December 2001 after the arrival of new owners of the club (including the former jockey Willie Carson). The peak of his Swindon career came in the 2003‚Äì04 season, when Swindon qualified for the Division Two playoffs, only to lose on penalties to Brighton and Hove Albion in the semi-finals. King was eventually dismissed by Swindon on 26 September 2005, after five successive defeats had left Swindon second from bottom in Football League One. He then worked as a scout until being appointed as manager of Conference National side Grays Athletic on 23 November 2006. However, he surprisingly resigned for personal reasons on 4 January 2007. He was a scout for former team Everton, but on 3 December 2007 King was appointed Chief Scout at Championship side Plymouth Argyle. He was then appointed as Head Scout at Colchester United in 2010. On 30 November 2011, King was appointed as Assistant Manager to Aidy Boothroyd at Northampton Town. After Boothroyd's dismissal as Northampton Town manager, King was placed in the role of caretaker manager, before moving on to MK Dons to take up a scouting role in February 2014. Death King died at his home on 27 May 2015 following a heart attack. He had previously suffered a heart attack in 2009. He was survived by his wife and a daughter.

He had contact with a mystic of Peshawar named Baba Kahan who he hoped to get initiation from but was refused: :\\"I associated with him for several months and during that time he showed supernatural powers on several occasions. When I asked him if he would shower grace upon me by initiating me, he answered: 'No, he is somebody else; I do not have your share'.

It was founded in 1979. Following the WSL's fusion with the International-Communist League in 1981, clear but informal factional lines developed in the WSL. Most of the parties in the TILC sympathised with the Internationalist Faction in the WSL. WSL delegates voted at the 1983 TILC group to prevent Chilean sympathisers from affiliating; the WSL then walked out after a resolution calling on Alan Thornett to fight Sean Matgamna's \\"revisionism\\". The IF who sympathised with the TILC were then expelled from the WSL, and formed the Workers Internationalist League. However, this group soon split, and in 1984, the TILC was also disbanded. However, a group of former WIL members established the Revolutionary Internationalist League (RIL) in 1984. The majority of the TILC sections (Italy, US, UK, Denmark) regrouped as the International Trotskyist Committee (ITC). Thornett and his co-thinkers were also later expelled from the WSL and established the Socialist Group which later merged with the International Group to form the International Socialist Group as the British section of the reunified Fourth International.

Roan (DD-853) was a of the United States Navy. The ship was named after Charles Howard Roan, a United States Marine who lost his life in action on the island of Palau during World War II. Charles H. Roan was built by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation's Fore River Shipyard at Quincy, Massachusetts, launched on 15 March 1946, and commissioned on 12 September 1946. From her home port at Newport, Rhode Island, Charles H. Roan operated through 1960 on training exercises along the east coast and in the Caribbean. Typifying the manifold missions of the destroyer, she trained with aircraft carriers, with submarines, in convoy escort exercises, and in amphibious operations. In addition, she gave service as part of the midshipman training squadron, as engineering school ship for Destroyer Force, Atlantic, and in North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercises. History1950s= On her first overseas deployment, Charles H. Roan sailed from Newport 9 February 1948 for a cruise which took her to the Mediterranean and service with the 6th Fleet, then into the Persian Gulf. She returned to Newport 26 June, and took up the training schedule necessary to prepare her for a 1949 Mediterranean tour. In 1950 her armament was extensively altered, and her next lengthy cruise came in summer 1953, when she carried midshipmen to South American ports. On 8 November 1950, and Charles H. Roan were engaged in night operations some off Bermuda. At 0103 the task group commander ordered the two destroyers to change station, a maneuver that required them to cross paths. Steaming at and running dark, the ships were on a collision course before anyone could take action to avoid disaster. At 0110, with sirens blaring a warning, they collided. Brownson‚Äôs bow tore a large hole in Charles H. Roan in the area of the after engine room and machine shop. Within fifteen seconds the ships had broken clear of each other revealing that the collision had sheared away a large section of Brownson‚Äôs bow and several forward ordnance storage compartments were flooding. Aboard Charles H. Roan, a sailor in the machine shop went into the sea through the hole torn in the hull, but within minutes Brownson‚Äôs boat had recovered him. He was a lucky one. As a result of the collision, five of Charles H. Roan‚Äôs crew died‚Äîthree instantly, two later‚Äî and several were injured, two requiring hospitalization. On 2 August 1954, Charles H. Roan stood down Narragansett with her division on the first leg of a round the world voyage. She sailed on to the western Pacific for 5 months of operations with the 7th Fleet, on patrol in the Taiwan Straits, and in carrier and amphibious exercises off Japan, Okinawa, and the Philippines. The division took departure from Subic Bay, 20 January 1955, and continued westward to call at Persian Gulf ports, transit the Suez Canal, and visit in the Mediterranean before returning to Newport 14 March. She resumed her training operations until 7 July, when she was ordered north to take station as a picket off Iceland and Greenland during the flight of President Dwight D. Eisenhower to the Geneva Summit. Charles H. Roans next Mediterranean cruise began with her sailing from Newport 14 September 1956 to join the 6th Fleet. With the eruption of the Suez crisis that fall, she patrolled in the eastern Mediterranean. Since the Suez Canal was now blocked, December found Charles H. Roan bound for the Cape of Good Hope, rounding the African continent for 2 months of duty with the Middle East Force. Between 20 and 27 January 1957, she served as flagship for the Force Commander in a passage up the Shatt-al-Arab to visit Basra, Iraq. Her return passage to Newport found her rounding the Cape of Good Hope once more, and she reached home 3 April, in good time to take part in the International Naval Review in Hampton Roads in June. Late summer saw her crossing the Atlantic once more for visits to Plymouth, England, and Copenhagen, Denmark, while participating in North Atlantic Treaty Organization Operation \\"Strikeback.\\" Arriving at Annapolis on 12 July 1958 to take the midshipmen on board, Charles H. Roan got underway on what was to be a brief cruise. But plans swiftly changed upon the outbreak of the trouble in the Middle East which led to the landing of Marines by the fleet in Lebanon. First, Charles H. Roan proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, to take on board additional stores and ammunition necessary for a lengthy deployment, then sailed south to escort an amphibious group to training operations designed as preparation for any extension of the Middle Eastern trouble. She proceeded on across the Atlantic, arriving at Naples 14 August to transfer the midshipmen to other ships. Thus released, she sailed on to the coast of Lebanon, where she and patrolled in support of the forces ashore. Now trouble flared up in the Far East, as the Chinese Communists resumed the bombardment of the Chinese Nationalist-held offshore islands. Charles H. Roan and Forrest Royal joined the group, augmenting the screen of two destroyers already accompanying the carrier. The group passed through the Suez Canal on 29 August 1958, and until 27 September 1958, she patrolled off Taiwan. Her return passage to Newport took her around the Cape of Good Hope. She arrived home on 18 November 1958 to a welcome in Narragansett Bay. Adding to her list of historic operations, in the summer of 1958, Charles H. Roan participated in Operation \\"Inland Sea,\\" the first passage of a naval force through the Saint Lawrence Seaway into the Great Lakes. She visited many ports and took part in the ceremonies dedicating the Seaway. On 31 March 1960, Charles H. Roan arrived in the Mediterranean again for a cruise which included duty with the key Middle East Force, and visits to many Persian Gulf ports. Returning to Newport in October, Charles H. Roan operated off the east coast for the remainder of the year. =1960s= Charles H. Roan at Taranto in 1964. On 31 March 1960, the ship once again travelled to the Mediterranean for a cruise which included duty with the key Middle East Force, cruising in the Red Sea, and visits to many Persian Gulf ports. On returning home, Charles H. Roan took on duties as DesLant Engineering School Ship until July 1961 when she entered the New York Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, New York, for her Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) conversion. Upon completing FRAM in June 1962, the ship sailed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for refresher training. She was back in Newport, Rhode Island, for two weeks before hastily departing for the Cuban Quarantine Operations. In 1963, after a midshipmen cruise to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Charles H. Roan was the third ship in the Atlantic Fleet to qualify with DASH (Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopters), and the first ship to use these helicopters operationally. Now a first-line anti-submarine warfare (ASW) ship, Charles H. Roan again participated in a Mediterranean deployment with other units of the Sixth Fleet from April through August 1964. In November 1964, after her deployment to the Mediterranean and following a brief operating period with units of the Second Fleet, she entered Boston Naval Shipyard for a three-month scheduled overhaul. Leaving the yard in February 1965, Charles H. Roan underwent refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This training was interrupted when she deployed to the Dominican Republic during that crisis, bringing with her one of the first Marine units to land in the Santo Domingo area. After her duties were completed in the Dominican Republic, Charles H. Roan departed for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to complete her refresher training. During the Middle East deployment in March and April 1966, Charles H. Roan once again crossed the Equator. She returned to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal and completed operations with the Sixth Fleet for two months, then returned home to Newport, Rhode Island. Later in September Charles H. Roan participated in joint Canadian/U.S. exercises, and paid another visit to Halifax, Nova Scotia. In January 1967, Charles H. Roan was underway again for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to undergo an Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) along with other ships of Destroyer Squadron 10 (DesRon10). She spent a week of heavy exercising in the area of anti-submarine warfare and naval gunfire support prior to the scheduled ORI. She completed the ORI and proceeded to San Juan, Puerto Rico. From San Juan, she headed for Culebra where she did a naval gunfire support exercise and later on ASW exercises in the operation area. The Bahamas and Virgin Islands were visited on this cruise before she headed home to Newport. In March 1967, Charles H. Roan deployed to the Mediterranean again where she operated with the Sixth Fleet until the end of July. During this cruise she visited Tripoli, Libya, Valletta, Malta, Naples, Italy, Athens (Piraeus), Greece, Bodrum, Turkey, Cannes, France, Naples, Italy, Gibraltar, among others. Charles H. Roan also provided support to other US Navy ships during the Six-Day War, and assisted in escorting to Malta for repairs after her attack by Israeli forces. Charles H. Roan returned to Newport in August, and remained there except for brief service for the America's Cup Races, held off Newport. During the months of October and November she participated in ASW exercises in the North Atlantic. She returned to Newport, in November and remained there for TAV and holiday leave while preparing for another Mediterranean deployment in January 1968. From 10 January until 20 May 1968 Charles H. Roan once again traveled to the Mediterranean to serve with the Sixth Fleet. During this cruise she visited Rota, Spain, Valletta, Malta, Barcelona, Spain, Naples, Italy, Ibiza, Spain, and Rhodes, Greece. While at Rhodes, Charles H. Roan assisted with the cleanup effort after the grounding of the destroyer . Charles H. Roan began a four-month regular overhaul at Boston Naval Shipyard on 15 July 1968. =1970s= On 5 April 1972 Charles H. Roan deployed from Newport. She circumnavigated the globe with port calls (chronologically) at Port of Spain, Trinidad; Recife, Brazil; Luanda, Angola; Lourenco Marques, Mozambique; Port Louis, Mauritius; Saint-Denis, Reunion; Colombo, Sri-Lanka; Manama, Bahrain; Mombasa, Kenya; Victoria, Seychelles; Tamatave, Malagasy Republic; Nossi-Be, Malagasy Republic; Karachi, Pakistan; Singapore; Hong Kong; Yokosuka, Japan; Midway Island; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; San Diego, California; Panama Canal, to return to homeport at Newport on 31 October 1972. During this cruise she entered Vietnamese territorial waters, but because of earlier propeller damage, was not an active participant in action in the area. After a deployment stand down and participating in a few local training exercises, the effort of the crew was directed toward decommissioning activities. On the morning of 21 September 1973, Charles H. Roan was decommissioned at Newport and immediately re-commissioned into the Turkish Navy as Maresal Fevzi Cakmak (D-351). Charles H. Roan was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 September 1973. =Transfer to Turkish Navy= Charles H. Roan was then transferred to the Turkish government, where she was known as TCG Mare≈üal Fevzi √áakmak (D 351) in the Turkish Navy. She took part in Operation Atilla during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. On 21 July 1974, together with Turkish destroyers D-354 Kocatepe and D-353 Adatepe, she was subjected to friendly fire from Turkish warplanes and heavily damaged after being mistaken for a Greek ship. She was stricken and scrapped in April 1995. References : External links *USS Charles H.

The Jedi find that they, too, are at risk of being absorbed by the collective consciousness of the nest since the collective accepts even non-insectoid species. Meanwhile, Tenel Ka, the Queen Mother of the Hapes Consortium, has become pregnant by Jacen Solo, and delays her pregnancy through use of the Force to reduce the chance of their daughter's paternity being discovered. When the child is born, she is named Allana. One year after the events in The Joiner King Jaina and Zekk work as a team to track down smugglers. They find evidence indicating that the Gorog, or \\"Dark Nest\\", are alive and somehow involved in smuggling.The Unseen Queen, Softcover pg. 10 UnuThul explains to Mara Jade that the Dark Nest is after her because it had absorbed the consciousness of the wife and daughter of Daxar Ies, a man she killed back when she was an Emperor's Hand operative. The Swarm War takes place where The Unseen Queen ends, and involves a three way war between the Chiss, the Killik, and the Galactic Alliance. Luke Skywalker declares himself Grand Master of the Jedi, and succeeds in unifying them to an extent, and leads an assault on the Dark Nest. Lomi Plo meets her death at Skywalker's hand, and UnuThul is defeated by Luke as well after losing an arm. Thul is taken in by the Jedi for psychological treatment as the Killik revert to their naturally peaceful state, no longer unified by the Hive Mind or driven by the ambitions of the Dark Nest.

She studied slips of the tongue, mishearing, and other speech errors and applied this to phonology, the study of how the sounds of a language are organized in the mind.  Biography  Fromkin was born in Passaic, New Jersey as Victoria Alexandra Landish on May 16, 1923. She earned a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1944. She married Jack Fromkin, a childhood friend from Passaic, in 1948, and they settled in Los Angeles, California. She decided to head back to school to study linguistics in her late 30s. She enrolled at UCLA, received her master's in 1963 and her Ph.D in 1965. Her thesis was entitled, \\"Some phonetic specifications of linguistic units: an electromyographic investigation\\". That same year, Fromkin joined the faculty of the linguistics department at UCLA. Her line of research mainly dealt with speech errors and slips of the tongue. She collected more than 12,000 examples of slips of the tongue, which were analyzed in a number of scholarly publications, notably her 1971 Language article and an edited volume, Speech Errors as Linguistic Evidence. From 1971 to 1975, Fromkin was part of a team of linguistic researchers studying the speech of the \\"feral child\\" known as Genie. Genie had spent the first 13 years of her life in severe isolation, and Fromkin and her associates hoped that her case would illuminate the process of language acquisition after the critical period. However, the study ended after rancorous disputes over Genie's care, and the loss of funding from the National Institute of Mental Health. Fromkin published several papers about Genie's linguistic development. In 1974, Fromkin was commissioned by the producers of the children's television series Land of the Lost to create a constructed language for a species of primitive cavemen/primates called the Pakuni. Fromkin developed a 300-word vocabulary and syntax for the series, and translated scripts into her created Pakuni language for the series' first two seasons. For the action-sci-fi movie Blade (film), Fromkin created another constructed language for the vampires in the film. She became the first woman in the University of California system to be Vice Chancellor of Graduate Programs. She held this position from 1980 to 1989. She was elected President of the Linguistic Society of America in 1985. Fromkin was also chairwoman of the board of governors of the Academy of Aphasia. She was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1996. Fromkin died at the age of 76 on January 19, 2000 from colon cancer. The Linguistic Society of America established the \\"Victoria A. Fromkin Prize for Distinguished Service\\" award in her honor in 2001. This award recognizes individuals who have performed extraordinary service to the discipline and to the Society throughout their career.  Research  Fromkin contributed to the area of linguistics known as speech errors. She created \\"Fromkin's Speech Error Database\\", for which data collection is ongoing. Fromkin recorded nine different types of speech errors. The following are examples of each: * Lexical: ** Target Utterance: A fifty-pound bag of dog food ** Error Utterance: A fifty-pound dog of bag food. * Morphological: ** Target Utterance: A cameraman who wants to make a report about the horserace. ** Error Utterance: A cameraman who WANT to er make a reportage about the horserace who WANTS to make a reportage about the horse race. * Morphosyntactic: ** Target Utterance: We began to collect a lot of data to determine what they may mean. ** Error Utterance: We began to collect a lot of data to determine what they may MEANT. * Phonological: ** Target Utterance: A bread bun ** Error Utterance: A BRUN * Phonological/lexical: ** Target Utterance: 280 days as compared to ** Error Utterance: 280 days as composed to * Phonologic/Morphologic: ** Target Utterance: DISTINGUISHED TEACHING award ** Error Utterance: DISTEACHING TINGWER award * Phrasal: ** Target Utterance: and then they start painting/need t'start painting ** Error Utterance: ...and then they START NEED T'...need t'start painting. * Syntactic: ** Target Utterance: a university that celebrated its 50th anniversary a couple of years ago ** Error Utterance: a university that IS celebratING its 50th anniversary a couple of years ago * Tip-of-the-Tongue: ** Target Utterance: Cherokee ** Error Utterance: it starts with a \\"j\\" Fromkin theorized that slips of the tongue can occur at many levels including syntactic, phrasal, lexical or semantic, morphological, phonological. She also believed that slips of the tongue could occur as many different process procedures. The different forms were: * Addition: Someone wants to say, \\"bomb scare\\" but instead says, \\"bomb square.\\" * Deletion: Someone wants to say, \\"I hope you use the same brush every day\\" but instead says, \\"I hope you use the rush every day.\\" * Exchange: Wanting to say, \\"can you sign on the line\\" but instead says, \\"cas you nign on the line?\\" * Substitution: Someone wants to say, \\"a vote for the guarneri quartet came in\\" but instead says, \\"a vote for the guarneri quartAte cAme in.\\" Fromkin's research helps support the argument that language processing is not modular. The argument for modularity claims that language is localized, domain-specific, mandatory, fast, and encapsulated. Her research on slips of the tongue has demonstrated that when people make slips of the tongue it usually happens on the same level, indicating that each level has a distinct place in the persons brain. Phonemes switch with phonemes, stems with stems, and morphemes switch with other morphemes.  Books   * ReferencesFurther reading * Subscription needed.

It is one of the area‚Äôs largest and most successful enclosed super regional shopping centers. The mall is the centerpiece of the Sunrise MarketPlace shopping district in Citrus Heights. Sunrise Mall is accessible from I-80 or Highway 50 from most locations in the greater Sacramento area. Anchor stores are J. C. Penney and two Macy's stores. History Sunrise Mall was constructed in 1971 by The Hahn Company and was originally anchored by J. C. Penney, Liberty House, Sears, and Weinstock's. Liberty House shuttered operations in 1984 and a Macy's (the current Women's store, which serves as their main store) opened in its place shortly thereafter, moving some of its operations from Birdcage Walk (now the Marketplace at Birdcage), a competing shopping center across Sunrise Boulevard. In 1996, Weinstock's was converted into a second Macy's (the current Men's & Home store), moving the rest of its operations from Birdcage. In 1999, Sunrise Mall underwent an extensive interior renovation for the first time, and in 2007, a 500-seat food court with a fireplace was added in the corridor between J. C. Penney and Macy's Men's & Home. In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Sunrise Mall, into Seritage Growth Properties. In November 2015, Spinoso Real Estate Group acquired the mall from Steadfast Companies. On April 17, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 24 stores nationwide. The store closed in July 2018. World TeamTennis Overhead view of a Sacramento Capitals match The World TeamTennis returned to Sunrise Mall July 8 for the first home match of the 2011 season. Sunrise Mall had lost this asset in 2007, when the Sacramento Capitals moved to nearby Westfield Galleria at Roseville. Many fans have followed the Capitals as they‚Äôve moved from the Sunrise Mall to Roseville‚Äôs Galleria and back. The team was very involved in the community and gave over a million dollars back to the community throughout the time they were in Sacramento. The 2011 team included world class players Mardy Fish, Vania King, Mark Knowles, Dusan Vemic, Christina Fusano, Nick Monroe and Sacramento‚Äôs own Yasmin Schnack. Wayne Bryan coached the team. In previous years, the WTT had guest players such as Andre Agassi and Anna Kournikova appear in Sacramento. In 2011, Serena Williams played against the Sacramento Capitals in front of a sold-out crowd. 2011 marked the 26th year that the Sacramento Capitals were part of WTT. Along with the growth of tennis all around the country, fan support grew over the years. Nine teams made up the 2011 WTT Pro League season, sponsored by GEICO. The short season ran from July 4 to July 24. WTT did a lot to keep fans in the game including soliciting support by giving away Capitals merchandise, Sunrise Mall gift cards and other fun prizes. T-shirts and other items were thrown into the audience during breaks. In addition, vendors were set up to sell food, drinks and tennis merchandise for the event. Activities and play areas for kids were set up and a live band played beforehand and performed the national anthem. DJ music was even played over the PA system, getting some fans to dance in the stands. The Sunrise MarketPlace, Sunrise Mall and the Capitals enjoyed a wonderful partnership that brought six WTT championships to Sacramento. On February 4, 2014, the Capitals, after 28 seasons in Sacramento, announced their move to Las Vegas. The team was renamed the Las Vegas Neon. The new Las Vegas team was shut down a few weeks later, before it even started after owner Deepal Wannakuwatte was arrested for running a Ponzi scheme. On February 23, 2015, WTT announced that a new ownership group had taken control of the Texas Wild and moved the team to Sunrise Mall, renaming it the California Dream.

It is the first book in the Dark Nest trilogy of novels by Troy Denning. It is set 35 years after the Battle of Yavin (35 ABY). In the chronology of the Star Wars novels, The Joiner King takes place after the final book of The New Jedi Order series, which is The Unifying Force, and before the second book of the Dark Nest trilogy, which is The Unseen Queen. Plot summary Six years after the Yuuzhan Vong War ended, all of the survivors of the Mission to Myrkr back in Star by Star, except for Hapan Queen Mother Tenel Ka Djo, respond to a call through the Force. They all leave their current posts and travel into the Unknown Regions. After this happens, an envoy from the Chiss Ascendancy, Mitt'swe'kleoni (Tswek for short), comes to the Jedi Masters' Council on Coruscant to file a complaint. He asks why the Jedi Knights are involved in a border dispute with an enemy of the Chiss who Tswek refuses to give the name for. None of the Masters give an answer, but Luke Skywalker agrees to look into it. He takes his wife Mara, their son Ben, and Saba Sebatyne into the Unknown Regions in order to learn what the Knights are up to. When Han and Leia Organa Solo discover this, they join the Skywalkers and Saba in their journey after they rendezvous inside an insect- like hive in space, which is filled with beings from all over the galaxy, along with strange insect beings. The Skywalkers, Solos, and Saba all meet up with Captain Jae Juun and his rude copilot Tarfang, who agree to take the group to the planet Yoggoy, where they will be able to find the Jedi Knights. On Yoggoy, instead of meeting any of the Jedi Knights, the Skywalkers, the Solos, and Saba all meet up with the leader of the strange insect beings that populate the world of Yoggoy, UnuThul. As it turns out, UnuThul is the badly burned and psychologically scarred Raynar Thul, a Jedi Knight who was taken by the Dark Jedi Lomi Plo and Welk during the Mission to Myrkr. UnuThul reveals that the ship that Plo and Welk took him in had crashed onto the surface of Yoggoy while the Yuuzhan Vong War was still commencing, and the insect beings who now call themselves the Colony took Raynar in to repair his badly burned form to the best of their abilities. A side effect of being with those of the Colony is that they eventually become part of their hive mind. Due to Raynar's Force-sensitivity, however, he had accumulated such power that he actually become the leader of the Colony, and he helped them expand their territory from Yoggoy. When asked about what happened to Lomi Plo and Welk, Raynar tells the group that he has never even heard of them before. Afterwards, as the Skywalkers, the Solos, and Saba find evidence that the Colony is really the long-lost species of the Killiks, the clan is attacked by dark blue Killiks. They survive the attack and confront UnuThul about the matter, who denies any knowledge about it. Regardless, the Skywalker-Solo-Sebatyne clan leave Yoggoy for Qoribu, where the Jedi Knights are fighting alongside the Killiks against the Chiss. Leia figured this out because when the clan visited the crash site of the ship that brought Raynar to Yoggoy, she saw a vision of her son, Jacen, telling her this information. As it is, Jacen had previously visited the Yoggoy crash site and had a vision of his mother visiting the crash site, and he decided to tell the vision where the Killiks and Jedi were fighting the Chiss. At Qoribu, where the Skywalker-Solo-Sebatyne clan plan to confront the Knights, they are once again attacked by the mysterious blue-black Killiks. They once again survive the attack, and they confront the Knights as expected on Qoribu's moon of Jwlio. From this, they come to an agreement: some of the Knights will stay behind in order to save Lowbacca from Chiss captivity, as he was lost in the previous battle against the Ascendancy. Jaina and Zekk are the ones who stay behind, but strangely enough, they don't sense Alema Rar's intent to come with Han and Leia back to Ossus. This prompts suspicion from Han and Leia just as Saba gets into a fight with a mysterious figure who is no doubt Welk. Saba is injured thanks to Welk and a couple of his blue-black Killik assistants, and she is knocked into a coma as a result. Before she was knocked out, however, she was able to discern that the remaining Killik who attacked her went to the Skywalkers' ship, the Jade Shadow. The Millennium Falcon takes a wounded Saba and a suspicious Alema back to Ossus. Ben gets in trouble by Mara for eating too much gelmeat. In Ben's defense, he says that it was really his new Killik friend who did it, which Mara takes to be a lie. Meanwhile, Luke looks into R2-D2's systems in order to find out what the cause of the strange malfunctions that the astromech droid has been suffering. Luke finds a recording of his father talking to a mysterious woman, which R2-D2 denies any knowledge about. Luke becomes suspicious of R2-D2's motives after this. As the Millennium Falcon travels back to Ossus with Alema and Saba, Leia subtly interrogates Alema in order to understand what she is really up to. When Alema refers to herself as \\"we,\\" the conversation awkwardly ends on Alema's part, and Leia knows that something more is going on. Later, after the Falcon undergoes a mysterious malfunction in hyperspace that was no doubt caused by Alema, they end up in an unnamed nebula and land on a planet full of plant life that, strangely, has no animal or insect life on it. When Leia and Alema go to repair the Falcon, Alema betrays her and everyone else on the ship, as Leia suspected, and she fights Leia and her Noghri bodyguards, Cakhmaim and Meewalh. Although Alema is able to defeat the Noghri, Han is the one who defeats Alema by activating an escape pod that knocks her unconscious. Later, after the Falcon is repaired, they take an imprisoned Alema the rest of the way back to Ossus. On Ossus, the Jedi Knights are tested for the hive mind that shared with the Killiks as Luke and Mara meet with a representative from the Chiss, Chaf'orm'bintrano (Formbi for short), in order to clarify the conflict between the Ascendency and the Colony. Formbi explains that the war between the Killiks and the Chiss goes beyond that of the border conflict, and was even somewhat responsible for the plot against the Fel family back in Force Heretic II: Refugee. Then, after Saba is healed from the injuries she sustained in her fight with Welk, Mara is quickly informed that there is indeed a blue-black Killik that had sneaked aboard the Jade Shadow. Realizing that Ben wasn't lying about the gelmeat, Mara rushes to her son's room and fights the Killik infiltrator. She defeats it, and has it tested along with Alema and the Knights. Alema and the Killik have the strongest connection, as the other Knights don't seem to feel what Alema and the Killik feel. Jedi Master and medical healer Cilghal concludes from this blue-black Killik, whose nest is of the Gorog as it turns out, that it and Alema are part of an unconscious nest among the Colony; this explains why UnuThul was unable to explain their presences. It wasn't because he lied about them, but rather, it was because he was unaware of their existence. Meanwhile, computer slicer Zakarisz Ghent accesses more of R2-D2's memory files and finds another recording of Anakin Skywalker talking to the mysterious woman that has to be his wife, and therefore, is Luke and Leia's mother. They, along with their friends and family, find the time to watch the newly found footage. Back to the main plot, the Jedi Knights are able to sneak out of their captivity and elicit the help of other allies in order to help the Killiks fight the Chiss. Tesar Sebatyne enlists the help of Raynar's mother, Aryn, while Jacen seeks out the help from Tenel Ka Djo. Tenel Ka reveals that she was able to withstand UnuThul's call through the Force by locking herself in her room until the call passed, as she couldn't leave her duties as Queen Mother of the Hapes Consortium. Tenel Ka agrees to lend the Killiks the assistance of the Hapan fleet if Jacen will agree to sleep with her. Jacen complies, and so does Tenel Ka. The Jedi on Ossus hypothesize a way to get rid of the Gorog, which they nickname the Dark Nest (hence, the title of the trilogy). They put tracking beacons on all of the ships on the Academy's hangar bay and have Alema and her fellow Gorog take one to return to the Dark Nest's base. They follow Alema and the Gorog back into the Qoribu as the Killiks and their new allies engage in an all-out battle against the Chiss forces. Luke and Mara follow Alema and her Gorog friend down to Qoribu's moon of Kr, and they battle off and kill and wound many of the Dark Nest before they confront Alema and Welk. Mara is wounded in combat, but she survives a suicide bombing from the Gorog she fought on Ossus by putting a Force shield around herself. Amidst the smoke cloud that followed the explosion, Mara saw a mysterious image lurking there. Alema escapes the conflict, though severely wounded. Meanwhile, Luke ends up in a one-on-one lightsaber duel against Welk. Though both put up a good fight, it is inevitably Luke who wins and ends Welk's life. Soon, all of the other Gorog on Kr are killed by the Skywalkers' backup forces, and the Battles of Qoribu and Kr end. UnuThul investigates the bodies of the Gorog, and they find Dark Nest cells filled with Chiss captives that are being used for Gorog offspring. This explains both the Dark Nest's motivation for going to war against the Killiks, as well as why the Chiss were going against the Colony. UnuThul agrees to let the Chiss have Qoribu, and the Hapans help the Killiks relocate to the unnamed nebula that the Solos found before Alema was revealed as a traitor. The Chiss return Lowbacca back to the Jedi, and UnuThul separates his fellow Knights from the rest of the Killik hive mind, their purpose in defending the Colony now over. Jaina and Zekk, however, due to their extensive time with each other, have an unbreakable hive mind with each other, which makes it awkward when it comes to Jaina's relationship with Jagged Fel.

It is part of the Columbus, Georgia-Alabama Metropolitan Area. Today, Gold Hill lies mostly in the corporate limits of Auburn. History Gold Hill was settled in the 1830s, and‚Äîdespite being in the southern reaches of the territory mined for gold in the 1840s Alabama Gold Rush‚Äîwas not named for the mineral, but rather for an early settler named Goldsmith. In the 1870s, Gold Hill received a second name, Gold Ridge, after confusion between the railroad stops at Gold Hill and nearby Camp Hill led the postal administration to rename the Gold Hill post office. Despite being \\"officially\\" considered Gold Ridge by the United States Postal Service and the railroad, residents have always considered the community to be only Gold Hill. Gold Hill is also the location of \\"Roamer's Roost\\", the home of epilepsy scientist William P. Spratling and his son, silversmith William Spratling. A post office operated under the name Gold Hill from 1837 to 1967. The Old Barn There was an old barn in Gold Hill which stood for 140 years. It was located adjacent to the railroad crossing on Alabama State Route 147. The building was erected in 1870 and served as the community's general store. During most of its history, the barn which housed the general store was connected to about of farmland. The store, and the farms that surrounded it operated much in the same way all the way up until the 1940s. Following The Great Migration, many of the field laborers left the area to begin new lives in northern cities such as Detroit and Buffalo. This left the community a shell of its former self. Eventually, the store closed down and the mail trains didn't make stops in \\"Gold Ridge\\" anymore (to this day, the mail is still delivered to the community from the post office in Waverly, Alabama). Despite this, the barn stood as Gold Hill's most recognizable landmark until it was torn down in 2010.

Goldberg and Sons plc, which traded as Goldbergs, was a Scottish retail company which, prior to its demise in 1990, had grown from a single Glasgow store in 1908 to a chain of over 100 outlets. At the Edinburgh store there was a cafe on the top floor with a roof garden.  History  A. Goldberg & Sons was founded in 1908 by Bill Goldberg, a Jewish immigrant from Eastern Europe. After starting business on the South Side of Glasgow he moved to premises in Candleriggs in the 1920s. Abraham Goldberg was chairman from 1908 to 1934, when he handed power to his two sons, Ephraim and Michael. Together they brought the company to the stock market and saw the development of the business from one department store in Glasgow to the building, by in-house contractors, of the Edinburgh department store, and the beginnings of a small chain in central Scotland. From 1970 to 1974 stores were opened in Falkirk, Ayr, Paisley, Kirkcaldy, Motherwell, Dundee, Kilmarnock, Airdrie, Dunfermline, East Kilbride and Greenock, with an average salesfloor space of . These sold a range of family fashions, household goods and electrical items. From 1974 onwards Mark Goldberg, grandson of Abraham, took the position of chairman. At that time Goldbergs was the only Scottish public company with a woman director. Goldbergs was a quoted company from 1938 and always had a member of the Goldberg family at its head. By the mid-1980s it was one of only three Scottish-based retailers still quoted on the Stock Exchange.  Innovations in EPoS  In the mid-1970s the company became the first retailer in Europe to introduce a comprehensive electronic point of sale (EPoS) system (an IBM system that was in place until 1987). Until that time all sales transactions were recorded in day-books, an operation which involved having 500 bookkeepers. Not only was the process costly in terms of people employed, it also created large queues in the stores. The system was supplied by IBM in the mid 1970s. A visit to the USA by some of the senior executives included discussions with Nat Solomon of the National Retailers Merchant Association. This visit was seen to be a critical one in that the company was seeking a survival strategy due to the increasing costs of the cash-taking system and declining profits. Solomon's advice was to wait for IBM to develop a system. Other companies offering cash-taking equipment included Singer. However, Singer's system was an electro-mechanical one while IBM were developing a computerized one. IBM were instrumental in defining the needs of the Goldbergs business and the successful installation enabled IBM to enter the European market. At a stroke Goldbergs' labour costs went down and queues in the stores disappeared.  Expansion  In 1979 the company launched Wrygges, a chain of young fashion stores targeted at the 15 to 24-year-old female. The late 1970s saw a one for three rights issue to fund this development, together with the expansion of the Goldberg department store chain with another three units (two in Scotland, and the first venture in England, in Blackpool). Goldberg's also owned the Schuh, and Ted Baker chains.  Stylecard  Goldbergs had its own in-house credit arrangements for its customers, based on three months' credit, plus a 5 per cent discount if the bill was settled at the end of three months. This offering was transformed into the Style credit card which benefited from the large customer base and the new EPoS system. Style was launched at the beginning of 1982 and followed the lines of other credit cards with no interest incurred for prompt monthly payment. Otherwise, minimum monthly payments could be made over a period of time while incurring interest charges. Apart from the development of Style, investment continued with the leasing of of warehousing outside Glasgow to become a new central distribution depot. By 1984, the Stylecard was being used not only in Goldbergs stores, but in a range of other non-fashion outlets such as Kwik-Fit and the travel agents A T Mays. Stylecard was eventually taken over by the Royal Bank of Scotland.  Demise  Following a failed takeover bid by Blacks Leisure in 1989, Goldbergs went into receivership and ceased trading in 1990 having suffered losses of ¬£10 million. The flagship Glasgow store on Candleriggs was acquired by entrepreneurs Vera and Gerald Weisfeld in 1994 and reopened as discount clothes store Weisfelds, a similar concept to their previous business What Everyone Wants. However, this closed in 1999 and the site subsequently fell into dereliction. The building was partially demolished in 2002 following the collapse of an adjacent tenement due to unstable foundations. The site was acquired by Selfridges, but plans for the company to build its first Scottish store on the site were shelved in 2007. After much pressure from Glasgow City Council, Selfridges began demolition of the former Goldbergs buildings in late 2013, with interim plans to turn the site into a landscaped area in preparation for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, although plans for the department store remain on hold. The proposals were formally abandoned in May 2014, when Selfridges sold the site to a private developer.

Background Born in Karachi, he was educated in St. Patrick's High School,Issue 2, 2006 The Goan Voice, UK. Retrieved 26 November 2011 Sind College and Downing College in Cambridge. He started his career in the services of the businessman R. E. Grant Govan in Delhi, and with whom he collaborated in founding the BCCI. Career The BCCI had it origins in a meeting in February 1927 at the Roshanara Club in Delhi between Arthur Gilligan, the captain of the visiting MCC team, De Mello, Grant Govan and the Maharaja of Patiala. The decision to form the board was taken at another meeting held at the same place on 22 November 1927 attended by representatives of various provinces and princely states. De Mello travelled with Grant Govan to England to organise tours of India by South Africa in 1929 and MCC in 1930-31. Both tours were eventually cancelled but the BCCI was formally founded at the Roshanara Club in December 1928 with Grant Govan as the first President and De Mello the Secretary.Mihir Bose, A History of Indian Cricket, Andre Deutsch, 1990, pp. 60-61 They represented India in the Imperial Cricket Conference in May 1929.Ramachandra Guha, A Corner of a Foreign Field, Picador, 2002, p. 191 De Mello, with Grant Govan, was also instrumental in founding the Cricket Club of India (CCI). As for BCCI, De Mello served as the founder secretary. Delhi was planned as the headquarters and location of the ground for the club, but it was eventually set up in Bombay (now Mumbai). Guha Guha, pp. 190-191 considers this as an attempt on the part of De Mello and Grant Govan to shift the headquarters of cricket in India from Bombay, but the book brought out by the CCI for the Golden Jubilee of the Brabourne Stadium Vasant Raiji & Anandji Dossa, CCI and the Brabourne Stadium, 1987, p. 11 attributes this to the non-availability of land in Bombay. But it does seem that De Mello played a prominent role in selecting the site and convincing Lord Brabourne, the Governor of Bombay, to allot the land for the stadium at a cheap rate. De Mello served as the Secretary of BCCI from 1928-29 to 1937-38 and President from 1946-47 to 1950-51. In the meeting of the cricket board in Simla in the summer of 1934, De Mello submitted the proposal for the national championship and a sketch of the proposed trophy which became the Ranji Trophy. 1950 National Games at Bombay: De Mello and Governor of Bombay (in garland) De Mello was also President of the Bombay Provincial Olympic Association and a key organiser (the Organising Committee chair) for the 1950 National Games at Bombay. He was also Organising Committee chair for the first Asian Games at Delhi in 1951. As the General Manager of the Gwalior and Northern India Transport System, he helped to modernise Delhi's transport system.Richard Cashman, Patrons, players and the crowd, Orient Longman, 1980, p. 20 He also headed the Jumna Valley Rail and Road Transport Company.Times obituary, 25 May 1961, p.17 De Mello courted controversy later in his career (in 1951, reviewing his time as the BCCI President, The Times of India called him a 'dictator'). His tenure as the President of BCCI ended with a defeat to J. C. Mukherjee, the President of the Cricket Association of Bengal, by 12 votes to 5, in the Board meeting held at the Imperial Hotel in Delhi on 1951-08-05. He had not been in good terms with the Bengal association for some time. When in 1949, De Mello came up with serious allegations against the Indian captain Lala Amarnath, the 'Bengal lobby' had strongly supported Amarnath.Boria Majumdar, Twenty-two yards to freedom, Penguin, 2004, p. 275 Amarnath threatened to sue the board for one lakh rupees but the matter was then settled with Amarnath tendering a qualified apology to the board. De Mello made another attempt at the presidency in 1952 but withdrew on finding that his chances were slim. De Mello's cricket career as a medium pace bowler was rather inconspicuous. Duleepsinhji once dismissed him as one 'who thinks he is a bowler but has never found anyone to agree with him on that point' Bose, p. 64 His greatest success as a bowler came for a Rest of India team against the Vizzy XI in 1930-31 where took the wickets of Jack Hobbs, Herbert Sutcliffe and C.

Days after his jail-cell suicide, Muenter's bomb exploded, setting off a fire, though the explosion did not reach the munitions and caused minimal damage to the ship itself. On 7 September 1917, Minnehaha sank within four minutes with 43 fatalities, after being torpedoed by German U-boat U-48, off the Fastnet. Her sister ships Minneapolis and Minnetonka were sunk while in use as troop transports during World War I.

In 2010, it had a population of 157,326. The name comes from the indigenous name of the location, \\"shallow pond of caymans\\", yakar√© (cayman, C. yacare) + up√° (pond) + gu√° (shallow), by the time of the Portuguese colonization. Jacarepagu√° is located in the West Zone of Rio in the Baixada de Jacarepagu√°, between Maci√ßo da Tijuca and the Serra da Pedra Branca. The upper middle class Barra da Tijuca separates the suburb from the sea. Jacarepagu√° is divided into the following sub-areas (sub-bairros), which nowadays are already considered different neighborhoods: *Anil *Curicica *Cidade de Deus *Freguesia *Gard√™nia Azul *Pechincha *Pra√ßa Seca *Rio das Pedras *Tanque *Taquara *Vila Valqueire The suburb is known for large open areas where events and shows, such as the last Rock in Rio, take place. The bairro contains the Camorim center of the Pedra Branca State Park, created in 1974. It is one of the greenest areas of Rio, with plenty of nature in some of the sub-areas, especially in Vargem Grande and Vargem Pequena. It holds a samba school called Unidos de Jacarepagu√°, churches like Nossa Senhora do Loreto, many shopping centers like Rio Shopping, Quality Shopping, and Center Shopping, and schools such as Garriga de Menezes, Pent√°gono and Primus, and several clubs, like Ol√≠mpico and Bandeirantes. In the mid-20th century, the area was home to the composer and mandolin player known as Jacob do Bandolim. It is also home to the Aut√≥dromo de Jacarepagu√°, which hosted the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix between 1978 and 1989. It also hosted the Rio de Janeiro motorcycle Grand Prix between 1995 and 2004. Recently, works have been done to build an Olympic Village in an area disputed by Jacarepagu√° (or JPA) and Barra da Tijuca, a neighborhood nearby. Regardless of who \\"owns\\" the area, the Cariocas that live close to it were very excited about the Pan-American Games that were held there in 2007. It's also the biggest center of TV recording studios in Latin America, where RecNov (Record's studio), Projac Globo's studio‚Äîthe biggest one in Latin America‚Äîare located. Band's studio, Polo de Cinema e Video studio are also there, and the Mexican broadcaster Televisa will soon open a branch there.

Located on the coast of the Caspian Sea, at the foot of the Alborz, it is approximately from Sari. At the 2006 census, its population was 83,537, in 22,034 families. History In 1832 David Brewster wrote in The Edinburgh Encyclop√¶dia that \\"Ashraff is celebrated as the favourite residence of Shah Abbas, and enjoys the only good harbour on the southern side of the Caspian\\". Prior to the arrival of Shah Abbas I Ashraf was a village of no distinction. The location took the fancy of Abbas I who made it an imperial residence in 1613 and he commissioned the construction of a palace and gardens. The heyday of the town was from that time until the middle of the 18th century. At the time that Sir Thomas Herbert visited the palace in 1628 there were about 2,000 families living in the town that at that time contained at least 300 public bath houses. However the town was the scene of both internal disorder and external threats (it was repeatedly sacked by Turkomans), so although it was still a significant town in 1727 when the peace of concluded the Ottoman‚ÄìPersian War (1722‚Äì1727), the town was gradually abandoned. Jonas Hanway visited the town in 1744 when it was in a state of decay, and by 1812 when Sir William Ouseley visited there the palace was in ruins. By 1860 Ashraf was no more than a large village of 845 houses with between eight and ten thousand inhabitants. Pictures of the Behshahr (Chehel Sotoun Ashraf) by Jules Laurens =Explore= Kamarband cave is notable for three human skeletons discovered there, dating to approximately 9000 years B.C. Other finds included flint blades, walrus and deer bones, giving valuable information about human development from the ice age in the Mazandaran area. Description The name Behshahr literally means \\"fine city\\". It includes many historical sites such as Abbas Abad the home of Shah Abbas I of Persia, Cheshmeh Emarat Palace, Baghe Shah Gardens and the Chit Sazi weaving factor Abbas Abbad which is famous for its greenery and beauty and also its historic significance is a major tourism attraction. There is a road which leads up to a mountain through the jungle. In the touristic Abbas Abbad, the jungle surrounds a lake with a semi-destroyed castle in the middle. The castle once belonged to the Shah Abbas. Behshahr is home to many famous Iranian figures ranging from actors to political figures. One of the more famous political figures from Behshahr is Ahmad Tavakkoli who once was a presidential candidate. Every year, famous members of the Iranian entertainment industry gather in Behshahr in a ceremony rewarding entertainers. More recently, such members included Parviz Parastui. The city of Behshahr is an industrial city which produces Tokhme, vegetable oil, and a dish-soap known as Rika. Rika is the local term for son. Behshahr is home to Behshahr Industrial Company which is the biggest producer of vegetable oil in Iran since 1951.Web search Recently, after scavenging near the suburbs of Behshahr, an ancient town was discovered which included nearly a thousand corpses of children to middle-aged men. The corpses had heights above the modern typical heights. In the area, gold and jars were found.  Abbas Abbad  Built at the order of Abbas I of Persia in the southeast of Behshahr in the midst of the Jungle, Abbasabad complex marks Iran's most prominent non-desert garden which comprises a lake, a palace, towers as well as showers while a mansion in the middle of the lake has given it outstanding beauty. The lake covers and areas of more than 10 hectares with an 18-meter- tall mansion at the center which hides underwater for more than half of the year; nevertheless, in the seasons of drought the whole structure, which has stood the test of time, resides out of the water.

Early life  Behramji Merwanji Malabari was born on 18 May 1853 at Baroda (present-day Vadodara, Gujarat). He was a son of Dhanjibhai Mehta, a Parsi clerk employed by the Baroda State, and Bhikhibai. His father, about whom nothing more is known \\"than that he was a mild, peace- loving man, with a somewhat feeble constitution and not overmuch force of character\\", died when the boy was six or seven.. His mother then took him to Surat (on the coast, 140 km from Baroda), where Behramji was then educated at an Irish Presbyterian mission school. He was subsequently adopted by Merwanji Nanabhai Malabari, the childless owner of a drugstore who traded in sandalwood and spices from the Malabar Coast hence the name 'Malabari'. Merwanji had previously lost two wives before he married Behramji's mother.. Author and editor As early as 1875 Malabari published a volume of poems in Gujarati, followed in 1877 by The Indian Muse in English Garb, which attracted attention in England, notably from Alfred Tennyson, Max M√ºller, and Florence Nightingale. M√ºller and Nightingale would also play a role in his campaign for social reform, and the latter would also write the preface to an 1888/1892 biography of Malabari. At some point, Malabari relocated to the city of Bombay (now Mumbai), then the center of commerce and administration of the British possessions in Western India. In 1882 he published his Gujarat and the Gujaratis: pictures of men and manners taken from life (London: W.H. Allen, 1882, OCLC= 27113274), a book \\"of a somewhat satirical nature,\\" that went through five editions. Malabari's life work began in 1880 when he acquired the Indian Spectator, an English language daily, which he edited for twenty years until it was merged into the Voice of India, which Malabari had already been editing together with Dadabhai Naoroji and William Wedderburn since 1883. In 1901 he became editor of the monthly East and West, a position he would hold until shortly before his death on 12 July 1912 at Simla. Malabari's account of his three visits to England, entitled The Indian Eye on English, or, Rambles of a Pilgrim Reformer (Westminster: A. Constance, 1893, ), went through four editions. Social reformer \\"What propelled Malabari to prominence across India and prompted his first visit to Britain in 1890 was what reformers in Victorian England and India called 'the problem of Hindu women,'\\". that is, his ardent advocacy for social reform with regards to child marriage and the remarriage of widows. In August 1884, Malabari published a set of Notes on Infant Marriage and Enforced Widowhood, that he sent to 4,000 leading Englishmen and Hindus. In it, Malabari deplored the \\"social evil\\" of \\"baby marriage\\" and demanded legislature to prevent it. Similarly on the issue of remarriage for widows, Malabari criticised the Hindu practice of prohibiting it, and he placed the blame squarely with that religion's \\"priestly class\\" and the \\"social monopolists\\" (i.e. the Brahmin caste) for their \\"vulgar prejudices.\\"Qtd. in . Although acknowledging that many educated Hindus deplored the practice, he repeatedly argued that it was due to inaccurate interpretation of scripture by \\"the greedy priests\\" and base Hindu \\"superstition\\" that caused \\"a girl after ten [to be treated as] a serpent in the parents' house.\\"Qtd. in . His \\"notes\\" were the prelude to an emotionally charged discussion that occupied the press for over seven years and made Malabari \\"one of, if not the most influential\\" Indian social reformer of his time.. In 1885, a girl named Rukhmabai was ordered by a Judge Pinhey to return to her husband or be jailed. Malabari's editorials of the Rukhmabai case gave the issue a popular focus, and it \\"was largely by his efforts\\" and the agitation of William Thomas Stead in the Pall Mall Gazette. that brought about the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885, and the Age of Consent Act (which regulated the age of consent for females in Britain and India) in 1891. In this, Malabari \\"was instrumental not just in refining the gendered dimensions of contests for cultural legitimacy and power in the western presidency, but in refiguring such contests for consumption by the British reform public at home as well.\\" His agitation for reform in India \\"through the agitation of the British public at home was virtually unprecedented.\\". In his conviction that the Hindu priesthood were misinterpreting the Vedas and Upanishad, Malabari was also instrumental in the translation of Max M√ºller's Hibbert Lectures into Indian languages. On the insistence of M√ºller and assisted by one N. M. Mobedjina, Malabari himself undertook the translation into Gujarati. Malabari then attempted to have the lectures translated into other languages (including Marathi, Bengali, Hindi and Tamil), and to do so travelled extensively to find translators and the funding for them. Although Malabari stayed away from the Indian National Congress as an organisation, Malabari attended the Indian National Congress in Bombay in 1885, and \\"he was a nationalist\\" and he had a close relationship with Dadabhai Naoroji,\\". one of the founders and leaders of the Congress. It was however to his advantage not to allow his name to be aligned to any specific political party or movement, as that would have precluded support from British politicians in his campaign for social reform as well as from the Indian princes of Patiala, Gwalior and Bikaner upon whose financial generosity he depended.

A pickguard (also known as scratchplate) is a piece of plastic or other (often laminated) material that is placed on the body of a guitar, mandolin or similar plucked string instrument. The main purpose of the pickguard is to protect the guitar's finish from being scratched by the guitar pick.Pickguard in Illustrated glossary at FRETS.COM As well as serving a practical purpose, the pickguard may also be used for decoration and is often made in a contrasting color to that of the guitar body (popular variants are white pickguards on darker guitars and black pickguards on lighter guitars). As well as plastic, other pickguard materials can include acrylic glass, glass, plywood, fabrics, metal, and mother-of-pearl/pearloid varieties. Expensive guitars may have luxury pickguards made from exotic woods, furs, skins, gems, precious metals, Mother of Pearl and abalone pearl. The pickguard is a very common site for an autograph, since the signed pickguard can easily be detached and moved to another guitar or sold separately as a piece of memorabilia. Pickguard types Pickguards come in various designs and shapes but designers usually try to match a headstock and pickguard design. Both can be used to incorporate logos, branding and/or elements of the manufacturer's/customer's style. Thin, dark pickguard on acoustic guitar = Acoustic guitars = Aggressive strumming with a pick can easily damage the polished surface of the guitar's soundboard. Pickguards fitted to acoustic guitars are usually made from thin (2 mm) sheets of plastic (such as PVC), attached with an adhesive just below the sound hole. The material should not be unduly thick or heavy since this might reduce vibration of the soundboard and alter the tone or volume of the instrument. Although not a job for the novice, a badly scratched pickguard could be removed and replaced by a guitar technician or luthier. On some older Martin guitars it is quite common to see the black pickguard curling up at the edges where the adhesive bond between the plastic and the wooden top has broken down. This does not usually present a problem and adds to the \\"character\\" of the instrument. Fender Stratocaster showing extensive white pickguard =Solid-body electric= Fender-style plastic pickguards are usually fitted on solid-bodied electric guitars such as the Fender Stratocaster and Fender Telecaster (and their many replicas) and often cover a large area of the top surface, because Fender guitars are front routed. Most of the guitar's electronic components (pickups, potentiometers, switches and wiring) are mounted on or behind the pickguard and this design simplifies repairs to the wiring once the pickguard is removed. On models with smaller pickguards, access to electronics on solid-body guitars are usually done through access panels built into the rear of the guitar. Tortoise pickguard on Epiphone Emperor \\"Joe Pass\\" with a signature and logo =Floating pickguards= Carved-top solid-body guitars, including electric models such as the Gibson Les Paul, and arch-top hollow-body guitars, such as the Gretsch Chet Atkins Country Gentleman use a \\"floating\\" pickguard: the plastic pickguard is usually elevated on adjustable metal support brackets. This design was introduced by Gibson in 1909 for its arch-top acoustic models such as the Gibson L-1.Fingerrest in Illustrated glossary at FRETS.COM It allows the height to be adjusted to suit the guitarist's playing position. The floating pickguard style is also popular on mandolins, mandolas, and other members of the mandolin family. Guild arch-top jazz guitar with volume control mounted on floating pickguard Materials While custom pickguards are made from variety of materials, most mass-production manufacturers use various plastics. The following are the most common:Pickguard colors and materials chart at Warmoth *Celluloid. Commonly associated with \\"vintage\\" guitars, this plastic is available in variety of colors and designs, but it has several cons that hinder its usage nowadays: ** This material is extremely flammable. Performers who smoke near their instruments with celluloid pickguards can occasionally put everything on fire with a misplaced cigarette. ** As a solvent based plastic, celluloid tends to shrink over the years, making the pickguard curl around the edges. It puts extra stress on the wood beneath the pickguard and sometimes cracks appear. This is very common on older Martin acoustic guitars. On electric guitars, where the pickguard is attached with screws, vintage celluloid pickguards tend to develop cracks due to stress caused by shrinking. *Vinyl (PVC). This material does not tend to shrink and is not highly flammable. *Acrylic glass. Custom designs The pickguard on a solid-bodied electric guitar is a popular item to be modified (modded) by enthusiasts wanting to add creative designs or use different materials. Several businesses now offer custom-made replacement pickguards to give an instrument a unique look. The pickguard is sometimes deliberately missing from a guitar's design. For example, superstrats with neck-thru designs aim for maximum sustain and tend to have no plastic parts, pickup frames or plastic potentiometer handles. Anything that it is imagined might dampen the sound is stripped off the guitar. Classical and flamenco guitars Classical guitars rarely have a pickguard since they are usually finger-picked and so are not subject to pick damage. =Golpeador= The golpeador or \\"tap plate\\" on flamenco guitars is not a pickguard, although it is sometimes called that by those unfamiliar with the instrument or the flamenco style. The golpeador is specifically installed to provide a stable surface for the heavy percussive tapping and striking with the fingers and fingernails, which are a regular feature of flamenco music. The golpeador (unlike a pickguard) is often fitted both above and below the soundhole.

It is Tyler's ninth novel. In 1983 it was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the PEN/Faulkner Award. Tyler considers it her best work. The book follows the lives of three siblings: Cody, Ezra, and Jenny, and explores their experiences and recollections of growing up with their mother, Pearl, after the family is deserted by their father, Beck. The novel ends with Pearl's funeral, and a surprise occurrence. The novel examines how siblings may share the same events yet experience them differently; e.g. Cody remembers his childhood as a harsh time. He blames himself for his father abandoning him and considers himself left to the mercy of an angry mother who favors Ezra. Meanwhile, Ezra remembers his childhood fondly and creates a nostalgic family-themed restaurant. Plot Pearl Tull is a rigid perfectionist. She has three children with her husband, traveling salesman Beck, who abandons the family. After Beck leaves, Pearl struggles to maintain a front as if nothing is wrong at all. Cody, the oldest, is wild and adventurous, but is envious of his brother Ezra, whom he believes is Pearl's favorite. As they grow up, this plays out in endless pranks. Ezra is passive, and never tries to get back at Cody. He is nurturing and sweet, traits that often interest Cody's girlfriends, furthering Cody's resentment. Ezra goes to work at a restaurant, which he later manages and ultimately inherits, while Cody becomes a wealthy and successful efficiency expert. When Ezra becomes engaged to Ruth, his star cook, Cody becomes obsessed with luring her away, and ultimately succeeds, but his marriage to Ruth is not easy. Ezra never recovers, and remains at home with Pearl; he is a caregiver, both for Pearl and his customers, but this is underlain by sadness. Jenny is the third child and the most scholarly of the Tulls, but in college, she marries on an impulse with unhappy results. Only in her third marriage to a man with six children whose wife has abandoned him does she find stability in family life and in her successful, if harried, career as a pediatrician. A recurring scene in the novel involves Ezra's unsuccessful attempts to bring the family together for a meal at his \\"Homesick Restaurant\\", reflecting his desire to unite and mend the family. At Pearl's funeral, Beck returns to the family for the first time. However, they never seem to be able to get through a single dinner without conflict, this time with Cody facing down his father, causing Beck to leave in the middle of the dinner. Ultimately, the entire family searches the town to find Beck, eventually bringing him back to the restaurant to finish their meal together. Reviews Benjamin DeMott, wrote in his 1982 New York Times book review: \\"Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant is a book to be settled into fully....Funny, heart-hammering, wise, it edges deep into truth that's simultaneously (and interdependently) psychological, moral and formal - deeper than many living novelists of serious reputation have penetrated, deeper than Miss Tyler herself has gone before. It is a border crossing.... \\"On its face Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant is a book about the costs of parental truancy. None of the three Tull children manages to cut loose from the family past; each is, to a degree, stunted; each turns for help to Pearl Tull in an hour of desperate adult need; and Pearl's conviction that something's wrong with each of them never recedes from the reader's consciousness. But no small measure of the book's subtlety derives from its exceptional - and exceptionally wise, the word bears repeating - clarity about the uselessness of cost accounting in human areas such as these....The behavior and feelings of all three are linked somehow with the terrible, never-explained rupture: their father's disappearance....But it's also the case that what is best in each of these people, as in their mother, has its roots in the experience of deprivation that they jointly despise...We arrive at an understanding that the important lessons taught by adversity never quite make themselves known to the consciousness of the learners - remain hidden, inexpressible. \\"What one wants to do on finishing such a work as Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant is maintain balance, keep things intact for a stretch, stay under the spell as long as feasible....We're speaking, obviously, about an extremely beautiful book.\\"DeMott, Benjamin (March 14, 1982) \\"Funny, Wise, and True,\\"The New York Times. John Updike, in his 1982 review in The New Yorker, wrote, ‚Äú[Anne Tyler's] art needed only the darkening that would give her beautifully shaped sketches solidity....In her ninth novel, she has arrived at a new level of power.‚ÄùUpdike, John (April 5, 1982) \\"On Such a Beautiful Green Little Planet,\\" New Yorker, p. 193. Margaret Manning of The Boston Globe thought that Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant is \\"a book that should join those few that every literate person should read....You surface from this marvelous novel as if from the bends, lungs nearly bursting, tears rattling on the page.\\"Manning, Margaret (March 28, 1982) The Boston Globe, p.

Styling The Flight Hawk was a product of a Raymond Loewy design. It was based on the Champion two-door coupe that was introduced for the 1953 model year. Like the other 1956 Hawks, the Flight Hawk received a new hood, grille, deck lid, and instrument panel. Flight Hawks otherwise had the minimum amount of exterior chrome. Things like oil filter, backup lamps, radio, clock, windshield washers, outside mirrors, heater, and full hubcaps were available from the factory or could be added through the dealer.

It is the largest 100% government-owned financial institution in Latin America. It is the third largest bank in Brazil in terms of assets and one of the five largest in Latin America. History The bank was founded by Emperor Pedro II on 12 January 1861, as Caixa Econ√≥mica e Monte de Socorro in Rio de Janeiro as a financial institution destined to collect national savings, mostly from the poor. Over the years, several similar institutions were created until most of them were merged into present-day Caixa Econ√¥mica in 1967. The 1970s were particularly lucrative for the bank, mostly due to its near-monopoly on savings for the poor and lower-middle classes, the management of Brazilian state (federal) lotteries and being the only lawful pawn broker in Brazil. In the 1990s, however, the scenario changed and the bank underwent a serious downsizing, in which thousands of employees lost their jobs. Part of the problem was caused by the modernization of the Brazilian banking system in the 1980s, with many other banks introducing savings accounts to their portfolios, Brazilian states being granted rights to hold their own lotteries in addition to the federal government's, a series of corruption scandals regarding lottery fraud, and the opening of the national market to foreign banks. The control of inflation also hampered Caixa's financial performance by making savings accounts less attractive. Nowadays, Caixa is the second biggest Brazilian bank and with locations in thousands of Brazilian towns, ranked the third-largest financial institution in Brazil by number of branches. Caixa has more than 85 million accounts, with liabilities worth more than R$ 237.00 billion in savings or investment. Together with government pension funds and other governmental resources, Caixa controls more than R$1.80 trillion (roughly about US$630 billion). Caixa is seen as a tool for public investment and expansion of access to financial services to the Brazilian public. Caixa is still the manager of most Brazilian lotteries, especially the most popular ones, such as Mega-Sena, Quina and Loteca (former Loteria Esportiva). The profits of Brazilian state (federal) lotteries revert to amateur sport promotion and elementary education.

He composed it in Weimar for Jubilate, the third Sunday after Easter, and led the first performance on 22 April 1714 in the , the court chapel of the Schloss in Weimar. Bach was appointed in Weimar in the spring of 1714, a position that called for the performance of a church cantata each month. He composed Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen as the second cantata in the series, on a text probably written by court poet Salomon Franck. The work is structured in seven movements, an instrumental Sinfonia, a choral passacaglia, a recitative on a Bible quotation, three arias and, as the closing chorale, the last stanza from Samuel Rodigast's hymn \\"\\" (1674). The cantata is scored for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, trumpet, oboe, bassoon, two violins, two violas, and basso continuo. Bach performed the cantata again in his first year as Thomaskantor ‚Äì director of church music ‚Äì in Leipzig, on 30 April 1724. He reworked the first section of the first chorus to form the Crucifixus movement of the Credo in his Mass in B minor. Franz Liszt based extended keyboard compositions on the same material.  History and words  On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. As concertmaster, he assumed principal responsibility for composing new works, specifically cantatas for the (palace church), on a monthly schedule. is the second cantata in this series, composed for the Third Sunday after Easter, called Jubilate, after , for Palm Sunday and Annunciation, and before , for Pentecost. The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of Peter, \\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man\\" (), and from the Gospel of John, Jesus announcing his second coming in the so-called Farewell Discourse, saying \\"your sorrow shall be turned into joy\\" (). The text, depicting the affliction that Christians have to pass, is assumed to have been written by Salomon Franck, the Weimar court poet who wrote most texts for Bach cantatas of the Weimar period. It follows details of the Gospel and the idea from the epistle reading: \\"For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfull.\\" (verse 19). The text of the opening chorus corresponds to , the text of the first recitative is taken from , \\"we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God\\". Franck contends that this is true not only for the disciples who were addressed directly, but for every Christian. Movement 4 sees the suffering of Jesus as a consolation for the afflicted Christian, movement 5 voices a decision to follow Jesus even in suffering, movement 6 offers the consolation that it will be only a short time until all sadness is overcome, alluding to (as in movement 4) . The cantata is closed by the sixth and final stanza of the hymn \\"\\" (1674) by Samuel Rodigast. The theme of the first part of the text is a situation of God's temporary absence. Bach first performed the cantata in the Weimar court chapel on 22 April 1714, then performed it in Leipzig in his first year as on 30 April 1724. In Leipzig, Jubilate was the beginning of the trade fair (Easter fair) which attracted visitors for three weeks. His predecessor, Johan Kuhnau, had already noted that \\"visitors and distinguished gentlemen certainly want to hear something fine in the principal churches.\\" Bach reworked the first section of the first chorus to form the movement of the in his Mass in B minor, the central movement of that work, three decades later. Franz Liszt based two keyboard works on the first section of movement 2, Prelude after a 'theme from Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen' by J. S. Bach (S. 179, 1854) [for organ or piano] and Variations on a theme from 'Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen' by J. S. Bach (S. 180, 1862) [for piano].  Scoring and structure  The cantata in seven movements is scored for three vocal soloists (alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir SATB, trumpet (Tr), oboe (Ob), bassoon (Fg), two violins (Vl), two violas (Va) and basso continuo (Bc). The duration is given as . In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4).  Music  The autograph score is titled \\"\\". John Eliot Gardiner notes that the keys of the arias and the closing chorale move upwards like a ladder, ascending by thirds. = 1 = The cantata is opened by a Sinfonia, marked adagio assai, which resembles the slow movement of an oboe concerto, with an expressive and plaintive solo. = 2 = , ground bass of the derived movement Crucifixus of the Mass in B minor The first choral movement, \\"\\" (Weeping, lamentation, worry, despair), is in form. The first section is built on a as an old-style passacaglia in 3/2 time. The lamento, a chromatic fourth ostinato, is repeated twelve times. Musicologist Julian Mincham notes that Henry Purcell arrived at a similar motif in Dido's Lament in the opera Dido and Aeneas, which Bach probably did not know. The first four words are each sung by a different vocal part, each overlapping the next. Beginning with the highest voice, each part sings an extended sigh. The setting is intensified, until in the seventh repeat all voices continue the text simultaneously: \\"\\" (\\"dread and need\\" or \\"anguish and trouble\\"). The ninth repeat is similar to the first, but in more extreme harmonies. The twelfth repeat is instrumental. The middle section of the line about the Christians \\"\\" (that bear the marks of Jesus), first marked \\"un poco allegro\\", is in a contrasting mood. Its last section is marked andante, the voices enter one after the other, beginning with the lowest and rising. Throughout the middle section, the instruments play colla parte with the voices. John Eliot Gardiner describes the first section as a \\"tombeau, one of the most impressive and deeply affecting cantata movements Bach can have composed to that point\\". = 3 = The only recitative, \\"\\" (We must enter the Kingdom of God through much sorrow), is accompanied by the strings in a . In German, sorrow is mentioned first, then the final Kingdom of God. Bach repeats the beginning text four times, while the singular destination appears only once. The key word \\"Tr√ºbsal\\" is illustrated each time by a downward line, each time with more intensity. In the end, an ascending scale in the first violin illustrates the idea of entering the kingdom of God. The scale is in C major, while the movement is in C minor, a symbol of the Kingdom of God which is a seen but not yet present. The scale is related to the beginning of the tune of the closing chorale. = 4 = The first of three arias, \\"\\" (Cross and crown are bound together), reflects the conflicting motifs of \\"Kreuz und Krone\\" (cross and crown) and \\"Kampf und Kleinod\\" (conflict and jewel). The aria for alto voice and an oboe which is almost always present, is in form, ABA. A ritornello frames part A, but also accompanies the vocal entry. It is thus heard six times in different context, related to the repetitions of the passacaglia of movement 2. The music illustrates the union of the four contrasting elements (all beginning with K): is sung as a melisma with a trill in measure 15, the preciousness of the jewel appears as a trill in the voice or the accompaniment. The text is also repeated in the middle section, as Bach was still experimenting with the form. = 5 = In the second aria, \\"\\" (I follow after Christ), the decision to follow Jesus is made. \\"Walking steps\\" in imitation symbolize the following. The first motif is an upward scale, illustrating the direction of Heaven, played by the first violin, imitated in fast succession by the second violin and then the continuo. The voice enters with the same motif. Towards the end, the steps are expanded to more than an octave, reaching Heaven. The bass singer and the continuo are in unison, interpreted as a mystical union of man and God. = 6 = During the last aria, \\"\\" (Be faithful, all pain), the trumpet plays the chorale tune \\"\\" as a ; Bach may have thought of the stanza \\"Weicht, ihr Trauergeister\\" (Go away, mournful spirits). The form of the aria follows the bar form of the chorale instead of the usual form. = 7 = The closing chorale, \\"\\" (What God does, is well done), is set for four parts, illuminated by an instrumental obbligato part. Masaaki Suzuki and Gardiner use the trumpet that played the cantus firmus in the preceding aria.  Recordings  The table entries are excerpted from the list of recordings from the selection on the Bach-Cantatas website. Orchestras playing period instruments in historically informed performance, and vocal ensembles with one voice per part are marked by green background.

The Republican National Convention nominated former Governor Ronald W. Reagan of California for president and former Representative George H. W. Bush of Texas for vice president. Reagan, running on the theme \\"Let's Make America Great Again,\\" stayed at the Detroit Plaza Hotel in the Renaissance Center, at the time the world's tallest hotel, and delivered his acceptance speech at Joe Louis Arena. It remains the only major party national political convention to have been held in Detroit. In addition to Reagan, Bush and keynote speaker Guy Vander Jagt; other notable speakers included former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon; former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former President Gerald Ford (the convention's opening night coincided with Ford's 67th birthday, and following his speech Ford was presented with a check to help fund the Gerald Ford Presidential Library); former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; Arizona Senator and 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater (introduced by his son, California Congressman Barry Goldwater Jr.); New York Congressman Jack Kemp; National Association for the Advancement of Colored People executive director Benjamin Hooks; Kansas Senator Nancy Kassebaum (introduced by a film by her father, 1936 Republican presidential nominee Alf Landon); former Texas Governor John Connally and former Ambassador to the United Kingdom Anne Armstrong. Presidential vote Following victories in several delegate-rich primaries in April and early-May, the former governor had a lock on the nomination prior to the convention. His last remaining opponent in the race, George H. W. Bush, dropped out on May 26 and urged his supporters to back Reagan. Under party rules then in place, only Reagan's name was officially placed in nomination. Because of this, former contender John B. Anderson's goal having a speaker at the convention was thwarted. The vice presidential selection Reagan waited until the Convention in July to announce his choice of a running mate, as was customary at the time. A short list of prospective running mates was put together after Reagan clinched the presidential nomination, including Howard Baker, William Simon, Jack Kemp, Richard Lugar, Paul Laxalt and George Bush. =Possible selection of Gerald Ford= On July 16 Gerald Ford consults with Bob Dole, Howard Baker and Bill Brock before making a decision to ultimately decline Reagan's offer. Shortly before the convention, the possibility of choosing former President Gerald Ford as the vice presidential nominee was given some consideration. Ford asked for certain powers and prerogatives that have been described as making Ford a co-president (had he been chosen). Negotiations for the terms of such an arrangement were held at the Hotel Pontchartrain. These included the return of Henry Kissinger as secretary of State and the appointment of Alan Greenspan as secretary of the Treasury in a \\"package deal\\". On July 16, Ford was interviewed by Walter Cronkite. According to Bob Schieffer, \\"The whole convention came to a stop,\\" when, after being asked by Cronkite, Ford did not dismiss rumors that Reagan was considering him as a running mate. However, negotiations ultimately fell apart later that day when the two sides could not come to an agreement. =Selection of George Bush= Reagan's selection of George Bush as his running mate unfolded after the negotiations with Ford reached an impasse, and was finalized less than 24 hours before the ticket was announced. It was Richard Allen, then Reagan's chief foreign policy advisor, who suggested Bush as a viable alternative to Ford, believing that he possessed \\"the best credentials of the possible running mates mentioned\\". =The vice presidential vote= Joe Louis Arena was the site of the 1980 Republican National Convention Even though Reagan had taken the unprecedented step of announcing his running mate choice from the podium of the convention himself, some delegates still resented Bush for defeating Reagan in a number of primaries, and especially the Iowa caucuses. In a direct challenge to Bush's nomination, they nominated Senator Jesse Helms to oppose him. The effort went nowhere, and Bush won by an overwhelming margin. This would be the last time during the 20th century that the bottom half of the ticket would be contested, as the rules would be changed in 1988 to prevent this from happening again.

History Droylsden were originally formed at the invitation of Joseph Cropper, the landlord of the Butchers Arms public house, to play behind the pub. After twenty years of friendlies and local leagues (including winning the Ashton & District League in 1913‚Äì14)Early Days Mossley A.F.C. disbandment, reformations and changes of strip, the club emerged from World War I the sole survivors amongst the village teams, and as members of the Manchester League. The club also adopted their now traditional colours of red and white, the inspiration for the unusual nickname of The Bloods. Two games in the 1921 Manchester Junior Cup Final against Hyde United who were in the Manchester Football League attracted over 15,000 fans to see Hyde prevail. However, the Bloods had their revenge two years later, taking the Cup from their local rivals. The 1930s was the era of Droylsden's record goal scorer, Ernest \\"Gilly\\" Gillibrand, scorer of 275 goals in just four seasons. Gilly's goals saw Droylsden to the Manchester League Championship in 1931 and again in 1933, and in the latter season he aided Droylsden to the Third Qualifying Round in their first season in the FA Cup. In 1936, the club successfully applied to join the Lancashire Combination and, a season later, became a nursery club to Manchester City, whose A team played at the Butcher's Arms. City's surplus players were available to play for Droylsden, but the link disqualified the club from appearing in the FA Cup. When other competitions were suspended in 1939 at the start of World War II, Droylsden entered the war-time regionalised Cheshire League. They remained in that competition, which was regarded in some quarters as being on a par with the Football League Third Division North, and reaching their highest ever league position as runners-up in their second season in 1945‚Äì46. However, the club could not build on that start and, four seasons later, failed in their second successive bid for re-election. Worse was to come with the sale of the Butcher's Arms lease to Belle Vue FC, who renamed themselves Droylsden United. All of which meant that the Bloods were forced out to the nearby Moorside Trotting Stadium, affectionately referred to by fans as 'Pork Park'. The town was not big enough to support two clubs, especially with bad feeling between them, and after the local council bought the ground, a merger was negotiated. Droylsden went home in 1952 to a renovated ground whose pitch had been rotated to its present position, finally eradicating a long-standing drainage problem. Two decades in the Lancashire Combination ended in 1968 with a return to the Cheshire League, after that League had lost seven clubs to the formation of the Northern Premier League. Droylsden never climbed above mid-table in the Cheshire League, but won the Manchester Senior Cup in 1973, 1976 and 1979 and enjoyed some FA Cup success, reaching the Fourth Qualifying Round four times in five seasons and the Cup proper twice. In 1976 Droylsden lost 5‚Äì3 in a First round replay at Grimsby Town, after a late home goal was disallowed. In 1978, Dave Taylor's goal at Rochdale sent Droylsden through to a second round tie at home to Altrincham, who ended the run with a 2‚Äì0 win. However, when the late 1970s side broke up, Droylsden's fortunes slumped, and they finished a distant bottom of the newly formed Cheshire League First Division in 1982. They were spared relegation when the Cheshire League voted to merge with the Lancashire Combination to create the North West Counties League. Droylsden were placed in Division Two of three. The unstable period ended with the appointment of Mark Fallon as player-manager. In his second season Fallon guided the club to the Second Division Championship, which was Droylsden's first senior honour. Droylsden have never played in North West Counties League Division 1. Their Second Division Championship coincided with the formation of a First Division to the Northern Premier League and the Bloods successfully applied to go directly into the new League. In 1990, Droylsden ended the season as First Division runners-up to Leek Town and were promoted to the Premier Division. The club struggled for six seasons, finishing no better than 13th, before being relegated in 1996 after conceding 100 goals. They were also on the wrong end of the fastest hat trick in FA Cup history, conceding three goals in 2 minutes and 28 seconds in the Preliminary Round away to Nantwich Town. Under the dual Chairmanship and management of Dave Pace, the club rebuilt itself quickly, and in 1998‚Äì99 won the First Division Championship on goals scored, regaining their Premier Division place. Droylsden also enjoyed a revival of their FA Cup ambitions, reaching the Fourth Qualifying Round in successive seasons in 1998 and 1999. Droylsden were better prepared for life at Premier Division level and in 2004 were invited to join the Football Conference as founder members of the new regional North Division. After finishing third in the inaugural season of the Conference North, Droylsden were looking to go one better and reach the top tier of non-league football for the first time in their history. A fourth-place finish in the 2005‚Äì06 season gave Droylsden a second chance to reach the Conference National through the play-offs. However, they narrowly missed out on promotion in a penalty shoot-out in the final against Stafford Rangers. On 29 March 2006, Droylsden lost 2‚Äì1 to Hyde United in the final of the Manchester Premier Cup. On 18 April 2007 they beat Flixton 3‚Äì0 in the final of the Manchester Premier Cup. Three days later they beat Harrogate Town 2‚Äì0 and so won promotion to the Conference National as Conference North champions with two games in hand. However, they struggled in the Conference National, and were relegated back to the Conference North on 8 April 2008, even though they beat Farsley Celtic 2‚Äì1, due to Weymouth's draw against Grays Athletic the same evening. In the 2008‚Äì09 FA Cup, Droylsden beat League Two side Darlington, 1‚Äì0 in a replay earning themselves a place in the Second Round Proper against Chesterfield. On 23 December they beat Chesterfield 2‚Äì1 after three previous attempts to play the match. The first game was abandoned at half time, with Droylsden leading 1‚Äì0, because of fog which restricted visibility to less than fifty yards, the second was a 2‚Äì2 draw, then the replay at Droylsden was abandoned after the floodlights failed on 72 minutes with Chesterfield leading 2‚Äì0. In the final replayed game Droylsden won 2‚Äì1, with defender Sean Newton scoring twice for Droylsden to secure the club a third round tie against Ipswich Town. However, it emerged after the game that Newton was due to serve a one-game suspension on the day after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season on 9 December. Droylsden had been informed of the suspension by the Football Association on 10 December. This meant that Newton was ineligible to play in the game against Chesterfield. The FA investigated the incident with the matter dealt with by an FA Cup committee on 29 December, after which the three clubs involved were informed of the decision, which was that the club were expelled from the competition, after being found guilty of fielding an ineligible player. The club lodged an appeal which failed. A decent FA Cup run came in the 2010‚Äì11 season, when Droylsden took Football League One (third tier) side Leyton Orient to a replay in the second round. They were 2‚Äì0 up at Brisbane Road after 54 minutes, only for two late goals to draw Orient level and force extra time. Any hopes of a giant killing upset for Droylsden were quickly crushed as Orient went on rampage to win the game 8‚Äì2 after extra time. On 6 August 2020, Droylsden withdrew from the Northern Premier League, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the club.

Overrunning dikes, it shattered the coastline and caused thousands of deaths (8,000 to 15,000 people drowned) and catastrophic material damage. Much of the island of Strand washed away, forming the islands Nordstrand, Pellworm and several halligen. Background The Burchardi flood hit Schleswig-Holstein during a period of economic weakness. In 1603 a plague epidemic spread across the land, killing many. The flooding occurred during the Thirty Years' War, which also did not spare Schleswig-Holstein. Fighting had occurred between locals and the troops of Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, especially on Strand Island. The people of Strand were resisting changes to their old defence treaties and the forced accommodation of troops. Supported by a Danish expeditionary fleet, they succeeded in repulsing first an imperial army and later the duke's men, but were eventually defeated in 1629. The island and subsequently also the means of coastal protection suffered from the strife. The Burchardi flood was merely the last in a series of floods that hit the coastline of Schleswig-Holstein in that period. In 1625, great ice-floats had already caused major damage to the dikes.Zitscher, Fritz-Ferdinand. \\"Der Einflu√ü der Sturmfluten auf die historische Entwicklung des nordfriesischen Lebensraumes\\", p. 169. In Reinhardt, Die erschreckliche Wasser-Fluth 1634 Several storm floods are reported by the chronicles during the years prior to 1634; the fact that the dikes did not hold even during summer provides evidence for their insufficient maintenance. Course of events While the weather had been calm for weeks prior to the flood, a strong storm occurred from the east on the evening of 11 October 1634Panten, Albert. \\"Der Chronist Hans Detleff aus Windbergen zur Flut von 1634\\", p. 8. In Reinhardt, Die erschreckliche Wasser-Fluth 1634, citing: Hans Detleff, Dithmarsische Historische Relation. which turned southwest during the evening and developed into a European windstorm from the northwest. The most comprehensive report is preserved from Dutch hydraulic engineer Jan Leeghwater who was tasked with land reclamation in a part of the Dageb√ºll bay. He writes:cited after Riecken, p. 11 ff.: \\"gegen den Abend [hat] sich ein gro√üer Sturm und Unwetter von S√ºdwest her aus der See erhoben [‚Ä¶] Da begann der Wind aus dem Westen so heftig zu wehen, da√ü kein Schlaf in unsere Augen kam. Als wir ungef√§hr eine Stunde auf dem Bett gelegen hatten, sagte mein Sohn zu mir ‚ÄûVater, ich f√ºhle das Wasser auf mein Angesicht tropfen‚Äú. Die Wogen sprangen am Seedeich in die H√∂he auf das Dach des Hauses. Es war ganz gef√§hrlich anzuh√∂ren.\\" Leeghwater and his son fled over the dike towards a manor which was situated on higher terrain while the water had almost reached the top of the dike. At the time there were 38 persons in that manor, 20 of whom were refugees from lower lands. He continues:cited after Riecken, p. 11 ff.: \\"Der Wind drehte sich ein wenig nach Nordwesten und wehte platt gegen das Herrenhaus, so hart und steif, wie ich's in meinem Leben nicht gesehen habe. An einer starken T√ºr, die an der Westseite stand, sprangen die Riegel aus dem Pfosten von den Meereswogen, so da√ü das Wasser das Feuer ausl√∂schte und so hoch auf den Flur kam, da√ü es √ºber meine Kniestiefel hinweglief, ungef√§hr 13 Fu√ü h√∂her als das Maifeld des alten Landes [‚Ä¶] Am Nordende des Herrenhauses, welches dicht am Seetief stand, sp√ºlte die Erde unter dem Haus weg [‚Ä¶] Infolgedessen barst das Haus, die Diele und der Boden auseinander [‚Ä¶] Es schien nicht anders als solle das Herrenhaus mit allen, die darin waren, vom Deich absp√ºlen. Des Morgens [‚Ä¶] da waren alle Zelte und H√ºtten weggesp√ºlt, die auf dem ganzen Werk waren, sechs- oder siebenunddrei√üig an der Zahl, mit allen Menschen, die darin waren. [‚Ä¶] Gro√üe Seeschiffe waren auf dem hohen Deich stehengeblieben, wie ich selber gesehen habe. Mehrere Schiffe standen in Husum auf der hohen Stra√üe. Ich bin auch den Strand allda geritten, da hab ich wunderliche Dinge gesehen, viele verschiedene tote Tiere, Balken von H√§usern, zertr√ºmmerte Wagen und eine ganze Menge Holz, Heu, Stroh und Stoppeln. Auch habe ich dabei so manche Menschen gesehen, die ertrunken waren.\\" The witness Peter Sax from Koldenb√ºttel described the scenario as follows:cited after Riecken, p. 35 ff.: ...um sechs Uhr am abend fing Gott der Herr aus dem Osten mit Wind und Regen zu wettern, um sieben wendete er den Wind nach dem S√ºdwesten und lie√ü ihn so stark wehen, da√ü fast kein Menschen gehen oder stehen konnte, um acht und neun waren alle Deiche schon zerschlagen [‚Ä¶] Gott der Herr lie√ü donnern, regnen, hageln, blitzen und den Wind so kr√§ftig wehen, da√ü die Grundfeste der Erde sich bewegten [‚Ä¶] um zehn Uhr war alles geschehen. In combination with half a spring tide, the wind was pushing the water against the coastline with such a force that the first dike broke in the Stinteb√ºll parish on Strand island at 10 p.m. About two hours past midnight the water had reached its peak level. Contemporary reports write of a water level on the mainland of ca. above mean high tide, which is only slightly below the all-time highest flood level that was recorded at Husum during the 1976 flood with above mean high tide. The water rose so high that not only were the dikes destroyed but also houses in the shallow marshlands and even those on artificial dwelling hills were flooded. Some houses collapsed while others were set on fire due to unattended fireplaces. Direct consequences Old Nordstrand (Strand) on a map by thumb In this night the dikes broke at several hundred locations along the North Sea coastline of Schleswig-Holstein. Estimations of fatalities range from 8,000 to 15,000. 8,000 local victims are counted by contemporary sources and from comparisons of parish registers. The actual number is likely to be much higher though because according to Anton Heimreich's Nordfriesische Chronik \\"many alien threshers and working people had been in the land whose number could just not be accounted for with certainty.\\"cited after Riecken, p. 42: \\"viele fremde Drescher und Arbeitsleute im Lande gewesen, von deren Anzahl man so eben keine Gewissheit hat haben k√∂nnen.\\" On Strand alone, at least 6,123 people lost their lives due to 44 dike breaches, which relates to two thirds of the entire population of the island. Moreover, 50,000 pieces of livestock were lost. The water destroyed 1,300 houses and 30 mills. All 21 churches on Strand were heavily damaged, 17 of which were completely destroyed. Almost the entire new harvest was lost. And the island of Strand was torn apart, forming the smaller islands Nordstrand and Pellworm and the halligen S√ºdfall and Nordstrandischmoor. The N√ºbbel and Nieland halligen submerged in the sea. On the Eiderstedt peninsula, 2,107 people and 12,802 items of livestock drowned and 664 houses were destroyed by the flood according to Heimreich's chronicle. Heimreich counts 383 dead in Dithmarschen. These fatalities were especially massive in the Busen parish (today's B√ºsum) and the areas along the mouth of the river Eider where 168 people died, 1,360 pieces of livestock were lost and 102 houses \\"drifted away\\". Numerous people were killed in the coastal marshlands and victims were recorded even in settlements in the back-country like Bargum, Breklum, Almdorf or Bohmstedt. Even in Hamburg dikes broke in the Hammerbrook and Wilhelmsburg quarters. In Lower-Saxony, the dike of Hove broke at a length of 900 m. The ambitious project by the Dukes of Gottorp to shut off the bay of Dageb√ºll, today's B√∂kingharde, with one single, large dike, which had been progressing after ten years of hard work, was now finally destroyed by the flood. Fageb√ºll and Fahretoft which were still halligen back then suffered great losses of land and lives. The church of Ockholm was destroyed and the sea dike had to be relocated landwards. Long-term effects Islands and Halligen which were formed from the remains of Strand island The Burchardi flood had especially severe consequences for Strand island where large parts of the land were lying below sea level. For weeks and months after the flood the water did not run off. Due to tidal currents the size of the dike breaches increased and several dike lines were eventually completely washed into the sea. This meant that a lot of arable land which had still been worked on directly after the flood had to be abandoned in later times because it could not be kept against the intruding sea. Saline sea water frequently submerged the fields of Strand so that they could no longer be used for agriculture. M. L√∂bedanz, the preacher of Gaikeb√ºll, describes the situation on Nordstrand after the flood: In cultural terms, the Old Nordstrand variety of the North Frisian language was lost. The number of victims who spoke the idiom was too high and moreover many islanders moved their homes to the mainland or the higher hallig Nordstrandischmoor ‚Äì against the order of Duke Frederick III. On Pellworm, already in 1637 they succeeded in restoring the dikes for 1,800 hectares of land. On Nordstrand however, the remaining farmers lived on dwelling hills like the hallig people and were hardly able to cultivate their fields. Also, despite of several orders by the Duke, they failed in restoring the dikes. According to the Nordstrand dike law, those had forfeit their right of owning land who could not secure it against the sea with dikes. Finally the Duke enforced the Frisian law of De nich will dieken, de mutt wieken (Low German:\\"Who does not want to build a dike, shall lose ground\\"), expropriated the locals and attracted foreign settlers with a charter that promised land and considerable privileges to investors in dikes, like the sovereignty of policing and justice. One such investor was the Dutch entrepreneur Quirinus Indervelden who managed to create the first new polder in 1654 with Dutch money and expert workers from Brabant. Other polders followed in 1657 and 1663. This Dutch settlement is still present today in form of an Old Catholic churchhouse. The Old Catholic Dutchmen had been allowed to practise their religion in Lutheran Denmark and to erect their own church. Until 1870 the preacher there used to hold the sermon in Dutch. In the course of further land reclamation, both islands Pellworm and Nordstrand today have a total area of ca. 9,000 hectares which is one third of old Strand island. Between the islands, the Norderhever tidal channel was formed which has gained up to 30 m of depth during the last 370 years. It has frequently been a threat to the geological foundations of Pellworm. Contemporary reaction The people of the time could only imagine such a flood as a divine punishment from God. The evangelical enthusiast and poet Anna Ovena Hoyer interpreted the Burchardi Flood as the beginning of the apocalypse.

They are available under several brands depending on geographic location Fisher & Paykel, Kenmore Appliances, KitchenAid, and Bauknecht following a distribution agreement with Whirlpool. In 1987 Fisher & Paykel staff engineer Adrian Sargeant and designer Phil Brace developed the DishDrawer concept. A DishDrawer is based on a design similar to filing cabinet with each dishwasher having two fully independent cabinets (or drawers). The DishDrawer was exhibited in 1996 at Domotechnica and was launched in 1997. By this time Fisher & Paykel had spent $10 million on the machine's development. They are marketed as either an individual drawer, for small apartments or homes or double units which have two separate drawers stacked together. Each drawer is independent, allowing different wash settings to be used on different loads. It also allows dishes to be washed in one drawer as the other is filled. And is potentially more energy efficient. DishDrawer washers have capacity restrictions due to their lower height, limiting the size of dishes that can be placed inside. In response to this, Fisher & Paykel have added 'Tall' models to their DishDrawer line up. Early models were subject to complaints about the noise that they made when washing. This has been improved on with later models. The concept behind the dishdrawer is \\"to use compact technologies to provide a very space efficient dishwasher.\\" Fisher and Paykel have made several dish drawer configurations with single and double varieties available. This means you can install two single dishdrawers side by side toward the top of the bench for easy access or you can install a double dishdrawer where the two drawers are stacked. DishDrawers provide plenty of flexibility\\" References Category:Home appliances ","title":"Drawer dishwasher"},{"id":"2760132","text":"Kerek may refer to: *Kereks, an ethnic group of people in Russia *Kerek language *Angela Kerek, a German tennis player *Kerek, Markazi, a village in Markazi Province *Kerek, Tehran, a village in Tehran Province ","title":"Kerek"},{"id":"2760138","text":"CZE may refer to: * Czech Republic (ISO abbreviation) * Czech language * Capillary electrophoresis * Cryptozoic Entertainment, a trading card game manufacturer * Jos√© Leonardo Chirino Airport IATA code ","title":"CZE"},{"id":"2760141","text":"Minnehaha is a mythical Native American character.

The location in Ryvangen, which means \\"rye field\\", was acquired in 1893 by the army for a barracks and exercise field. On 29 August 1943, when the Danish cooperation with Germany broke down the German occupying forces seized the army and naval facilities in all of Denmark including Ryvangen. While the German army used the barracks for themselves, part of the exercise field was used as an execution and burial site for members of the Danish resistance. The execution site consisted of three wooden poles to which the condemned were tied and executed by firing squad. On 5 May 1945, in connection with the liberation, members of the resistance came to Ryvangen and only then did the public get confirmation that the executions of the German occupying forces had taken place there. The Comrades' Relief Fund writes that, on 5 May, members of the resistance discovered 202 graves in Ryvangen and that the minister for ecclesiastical affairs had the remains exhumed for identification. In a number of cases, the parish registers cited below state that the remains were brought to the Department of Forensic Medicine of the university of Copenhagen for an inquest. 27 bodies were actually found weeks after 5 May, with 25 found between one and two months after the liberation. One of the bodies found could not be identified while one exhumed body was identified as a Rottenf√ºhrer of the SS. The inquests at the Department of Forensic Medicine showed that at least 19 men mentioned in the parish registers of Bethlehem, Bispebjerg, Holmen, Vor Frelser, √Örs and Sct. Markus, √Ölborg were executed with shots to the chest, with seven men each receiving from three to seven gunshot wounds. After the liberation the site was converted to a cemetery and memorial park for the resistance members who were executed there or were otherwise killed. In connection with the burials there, the site was referred to as Mindekirkegaarden i Ryvangen (Ryvangen Memorial Cemetery). The bereaved could choose to have the remains buried at the memorial park or at a cemetery closer to home. On 29 August 1945, two years after the German occupiers had dissolved the Danish army and navy, 106 hearses thus drove from the Christiansborg Riding Grounds through Copenhagen to the memorial park in Ryvangen with the flags in the city flying half-mast. Bishop Hans Fuglsang-Damgaard inaugurated the park as a cemetery with the Danish Royal Family, the government and representatives from the resistance movement present at the funerals. In the center of the grave field lies a memorial stone for the 91 resistance members who were exhumed in Ryvangen and buried in a cemetery closer to home. The remains of 31 resistance members who died in German prisons and concentration camps are also buried here. The pergola along the eastern border of the park has a memorial wall with 151 plaques, one for each of the 151 Danish resistance members whose remains have never been found. On 24 December 1949 the newly formed Home Guard held a memorial service for the victims of the occupation in the memorial park. Every Christmas Eve since then the Home Guard holds a memorial service there. History Arne S√∏rensen, minister for ecclesiastical affairs, took the initiative to create the memorial park at the former execution and burial site. The park was designed by Kaj Gottlob, the garden by Aksel Andersen. On 5 May 1950, five years after the liberation, the park was finished and officially inaugurated. On every liberation day since then, the Comrades' Help Foundation holds a memorial service in the park. Monuments and memorials Burial site Execution site with commemorative plaque The sculptor Axel Poulsen created the monument For Denmark / The mother with the slain son () located centrally in the park. In addition to the tombstones, the park has a number of memorial stones and plaques, with a large communal plaque at the center. At the execution site the wooden execution poles were replaced by bronze duplicates, and a commemorative plaque with a verse by Kaj Munk has been laid down there. The inscription translates literally to: :Boys you boys who died :You lit for Denmark :in the darkest gloom :a shining rosy dawn ().  Burials  The large grave field with 106 graves = In addition to the 105 resistance members listed below, Harald Christensen was buried in Mindelunden on 29 August 1945. However, in 1950 prior to the official inauguration of the park, his remains were exhumed a second time and moved, leaving his grave empty. Similarly, Estvan Svend Aage Wehlast was buried in Mindelunden on 29 August 1945, but less than a year later exhumed a second time and reburied elsewhere. The official list of resistance members buried in Ryvangen does not include Christensen nor Wehlast. { ----- valign=\\"top\\"  style=\\"padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 45px; \\"  * Erik Gerhard Andersen * John Erik Andersen * J√∏rgen Arboe- Rasmussen * Emil Balslev * Hermann M√∏ller Boye * Karl Gustav Stricker Br√∏ndsted * J√∏rgen Buntzen * Erik Caland * Ib Mogens Bech Christensen * Ole Christensen * Preben Richard Christensen * Erik Briand Clausen * Erik Crone * Gunnar Mogens Dahl * Niels Louis Damsgaard * Bent Faurschou-Hviid * Poul Bernhard Finderup * Ib Fischer * Walter Svend Aage Florang * Helge Emil Frederiksen * Otto From-Petersen * Peter Wessel Fyhn * Poul Ib Gjessing * Svend Glendau * Hans Henrik Christian Gottschalch * Preben Gylche * Knud Erik Henning Gyldholm * Preben Hagelin * J√∏rgen Hall * Kai Ole Hammerich * Arne L√ºtzen Hansen * Christian Ulrik Hansen * Orla Jens Christian Hansen * Ejler Haubirk * Kaj Ove Hedal * Hans J√∏rgen Henriksen * Poul Erik Hildahl * Kaj Gersdorff Holbech * Ejler Frederik Hurtigkarl * Aksel Jensen * Helge Ove Jensen * J√∏rgen Juel Jensen * M√∏lgaard Jensen * Robert Jensen * Svend Erik Jensen * Svend Georg Borup Jensen * Hans Robert Filip Johansen * Steffen Harald Johansen * Sven J√∏rgensen * Thorkild Toftegaard J√∏rgensen * Knud Klitbo * Anton Laurits Emil Knudsen * Jens J√∏rgen Jacob Koefoed  style=\\"padding- left: 25px;

Coastlines along the Dutch-German-Danish coasts were significantly changed during and by a huge storm tide, the Saint Marcellus' flood - also referred to as the Grote Mandrenke - that occurred on 16 January 1362. Many villages and towns were lost forever. The outlines of Strand changed significantly, nowadays legendary Rungholt reportedly being amongst the now sunken places.

An elder brother, Ivor, died in infancy, and his sister Eileen (who became a notable sculptor and graphic designer) was born in 1907. Herbert McGrath was born in New Zealand but his family had moved to New South Wales when he was a child and Edith Sorrell had been born in New South Wales. The couple married in 1899. Both their families were of mixed Irish and English descent. McGrath was educated at Paramatta North Public School until 1911 when he was moved to Gladesville Public School and from there in 1916 won a high school bursary to Fort Street Boys School in nearby Sydney. In 1921 McGrath enrolled in the Faculty of Arts at Sydney University but subsequently transferred to the School of Architecture. While attending university McGrath also studied painting at the Julian Ashton School. In 1924 he published, in a limited edition of 30 copies on Japanese vellum, a book of woodcut illustrations and poetry entitled The Seven Songs of Meadow Lane. McGrath graduated in 1926 Bachelor of Architecture with first class honours and as the winner of the Wentworth travelling scholarship. =Cambridge & London= The Wentworth scholarship allowed McGrath to move to London where he studied at the Westminster School of Art before taking up a fellowship at Clare College, Cambridge. While at Clare, Mansfield Forbes had McGrath redecorate the interior of the College's house Finella, a large Victorian house on the Cambridge backs, now belonging to Gonville and Caius College. McGrath's bold modernist remodelling of Finella made adventurous use of materials, with copper-clad doors, an aluminium-walled bathroom, mirrored ceilings and a rubberised floor decorated with Pictish motifs. Setting up practice in London in 1930, McGrath's first commission was to design the interiors for Broadcasting House in Portland Place, London. To assist with such a large commission, he solicited the help of Wells Coates and Serge Chermayeff; the latter was passing through London and would emigrate to America in 1940. Further interior design jobs followed, including a design for the aeroplane interiors for Imperial Airways. McGrath was particularly interested in the architectural and decorative use of glass, writing several articles for the Architectural Review in the 1930s,and in 1937 publishing the highly influential book Glass in Architecture and Decoration. Some of his 1934 etched glass doors can still be seen at RIBA's headquarters in Portland Place, London. McGrath's personal major building project was the modernist circular St Ann's Court, Chertsey in 1936. The house was built for stockbroker Gerald L. Schlesinger and his partner the landscape architect Christopher Tunnard. =World War Two= Training - Aircraft Under Construction (1940) (Art.IWM ART LD65) At the beginning of World War Two, McGrath wrote to the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, with a proposal to produce an illustrated book on war-time aircraft production. As a result McGrath was commissioned to produce twelve drawings on the subject, for which he visited several aircraft factories. In all WAAC accepted 16 pieces from McGrath before he left England to take up the post of Senior Architect in the Office of Public Works in Dublin. McGrath also submitted some drawings of bomb damage in London which WAAC declined to accept. A number of McGrath's aircraft paintings were included in the Britain at War exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York during 1941. =Later life= In 1940 McGrath moved to Dublin where he was appointed Senior Architect at the Office of Public Works. In 1948 he was appointed Principal Architect, a post he held until 1968. He quickly took command of the resources which were available to give a recognizable \\"look\\" to Ireland's state buildings. These included specially-designed woolen carpets, Waterford glass chandeliers, Irish silk poplin hangings and, in terms of fittings, 18th-century chimney-pieces and ornamental plasterwork. He acted as supervisor and co-ordinator of the decor as well as the architecture, using his extensive knowledge of Irish architecture of the Georgian period. In the early 1950s McGrath embarked on the series of specially-woven carpets which are the particular hallmark of his government work. These were installed in public buildings in Ireland and in Irish embassies all over the world. The projects at the Irish Embassy in Paris were particularly pleasing to him. The embassy was an impressive 19th-century building, and the task of furnishing it fell to the Ambassador, William P. Fay and his wife Lillian. The Fays worked closely with McGrath, who among other things designed the carpets and chose the furniture; McGrath was assisted by Noel de Chenu. When the Fays were later appointed to Washington, they again called on McGrath to fit out a new embassy building. Throughout his 25-year programme of designing carpets for State building, McGrath relied on the traditional skills of hand-knotted carpet manufacture in pure wool which were available at Donegal Carpets in Killybegs. Through his support this company was enabled to keep up production even in the most difficult times in the 1960s and after. In Dublin, McGrath's principal concern was the restoration of Dublin Castle, which started in the late 1950s and continued for decades. Among the buildings he designed was the Royal Hibernian Academy, RHA, building in Ely Place, Dublin. He had been appointed an associate member of the RHA in 1949 and became a full member in 1967. The following year he became the Academy's professor of Architecture. For many years, starting in 1946, McGrath championed and worked on the design for a National Concert Hall for Ireland which was to be built at Raheny. However the project was always dogged by political complications and was eventually cancelled in 1973. McGrath died in Dublin a few years later in 1977, at the age of 74.

Gal (–ê. –ì–∞ÃÅ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π), was a prominent Ukrainian Bolshevik leader and diplomat. Early career He was born in Chernigov the son of an infantry officer. He was of Ukrainian ethnicity. He studied at the secondary military school of Voronezh, but left the army in 1901, and joined a student Marxist circle in Warsaw. He graduated from military college in St Petersburg in 1904. In 1902 he secretly joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), and set about organising a military section of the party among graduate officers in five cities. Early in the Russian Revolution of 1905, he led an uprising in Novo-Alexandria in Poland and was arrested for the first time, but escaped to Vienna in spring 1905. There he joined the Menshevik faction of the RSDLP. He returned to St Petersburg in May, and was made chairman of the military organisation of the RSDLP St Petersburg committee. Rearrested in April 1906, he broke jail five days later, and moved to Sevastopol, on Crimea, where he organised a military revolt. Arrested and sentenced to death, his sentence was later commuted to 20 years hard labour in Siberia. He escaped in June 1907, and hid out in Moscow, in the home of a sympathetic lawyer, Pavel Malyantovich. For three years, he worked among co-operatives and with the printers' union in Moscow, until his next arrest, after which he emigrated to Prussia, in July 1910, but was deported, and settled in Paris, where he acted as secretary of the Menshevik bureau. Soon after the outbreak of World War I, Antonov-Ovseyenko broke with the Mensheviks, and founded the anti-war paper Golos (–ì–æ–ª–æ—Å - 'Voice'), later renamed Nashe Slovo (–ù–∞—à–µ —Å–ª–æ–≤–æ - Our Word), which he co-edited with Leon Trotsky and Yuli Martov. He returned to Russia in June 1917, joined the Bolsheviks and was briefly head of the party organisation in Helsingfors, and Chairman of the Northern Congress of Soviets. He was arrested after the pro- Bolshevik riots in July, and detained, with Trotsky, in Krestny prison. He was freed on the day that the right wing military revolt led by General Kornilov collapsed, and returned to Helsingfors.  Storming the Winter Palace  Antonov-Ovseyenko returned to Petrograd in October 1917, and was appointed secretary of the Military revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. This meant that he played a pivotal role in military preparations for the October Revolution. Trotsky, who witnessed him in action, described him as \\"politically shaky, but personally courageous - impulsive and disorderly, but capable of initiative...\\" He personally led the famous storming of the Winter Palace, on 7 November (25 October according to Julian Calendar still used in Russia at the time), when Red Guards broke into the building where ministers of the Russian Provisional Government (excluding Prime Minister Alexander Kerensky), had taken refuge, and arrested them. They included Kerensky's Minister for Justice, Pavel Malyantovich, who had given Antonov-Ovseyenko sanctuary ten years earlier. There were no lives lost in this incident, which took on something like mythical status in Soviet history. It formed the climax of the classic 1928 silent movie, October, directed by Sergei Eisenstein, in which Antonov-Ovseyenko took a starring role, playing himself.  Political career  In the initial government formed by Vladimir Lenin after the Bolsheviks had seized power, Antonov-Ovseyenko was appointed to the Military Committee of Sovnarkom. He was sent to lead the Bolsheviks side in the first, relatively bloodless engagement of the civil war, at Gatchina, against Kerensky and a detachment of Cossacks, but had to replaced after he virtually collapsed from nervous exhaustion. On 21 December 1917, Antonov-Ovseyenko was put in charge of the Revolutionary forces in Ukraine and southern Russia. The army subsequently captured Kharkiv, where Soviet power in Ukraine was proclaimed. He opposed Lenin's decision to end the war with Germany, at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and was dismissed from the Red Army in May 1918 for fermenting guerilla warfare against the advancing German army. He was reinstated as People's Commissar for War in Ukraine in September 1918, and oversaw the defeat of Ukrainian People's Republic and White Army forces in Ukraine, ensuring the creation of the Ukrainian SSR. By the end of the Russian Civil War, Antonov-Ovseyenko was in charge of the Tambov Governorate, brutally suppressing 1920‚Äì21 Tambov Rebellion alongside Mikhail Tukhachevsky, with the use of chemical weapons.Nicolas Werth, Karel Barto≈°ek, Jean-Louis Pann√©, Jean- Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, St√©phane Courtois, The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press, 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, In 1921, he was in charge of famine relief in the Samara region. In 1922, Antonov-Ovseyenko was given the highly sensitive post of head of the Political Directorate of the Red Army, despite his public opposition to Lenin's New Economic Policy, which he denounced in a speech to the April 1922 Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) as a sell-out to the peasants. During Lenin's terminal illness, he backed Trotsky in the struggle for succession. He was a signatory of The Declaration of 46 in October 1923, which called for greater party democracy. In December, after one of his subordinates had been sacked for criticising the leadership, he wrote an angry letter to the Central Committee exclaiming that \\"we are not courtiers to the throne of party hierarchs!\\" In January 1924, he was summoned before the Orgburo, which was controlled by Josif Stalin, and sacked. Later in 1923, Antonov-Ovseyenko was sent on a mission to China - the start of an 11-year career as a diplomat. In 1925, he was recalled and appointed Soviet representative in Czechoslovakia. He was one of a large group of Trotsky's supporters expelled from the CPSU in December 1927, but was one of the first to recant and seek readmission to the party during 1928. Later he was envoy in Poland, but in May 1934 was recalled to Moscow to serve as a Public Prosecutor. In this capacity, he observed the first of the great Moscow show trials, in which Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev were the main defendants, and signed an article in Izvestia calling for them to be shot. He was then posted to Barcelona, as Soviet Consul General, during the Spanish Civil War, where he directed the supply of Soviet aid to the Second Spanish Republic and where he organized the repression against the POUM party. He was recalled to Moscow in August 1937 where he talked with Joseph Stalin about the events in Spain. After a month without a job he was appointed People's Commissar for Justice of the Russian SFSR in September 1937, but after just one month in post, he was arrested during the night of 11‚Äì12 October 1937, and interrogated. He was shot on 10 February 1938. Antonov-Ovseyenko was the first former Trotskyist to be posthumously rehabilitated, and in 1956 was named in a speech by Anastas Mikoyan to the 20th party congress. Later, his son Anton, a historian, feared that he was to be 'un-rehabilitated', and fought a long rearguard battle to protect his reputation.

He rose through the Royalist ranks during the conflict, but later had his land- holdings seized when the Cavaliers were finally defeated by Parliamentary forces. Following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, he was one of eight individuals rewarded with grants of land in Carolina by King Charles II for having supported his efforts to regain the throne. Origins He was the second son of Peter Colleton (d.1622) of Exeter in Devon, Sheriff of Exeter in 1618, who was born in the parish of Monkenzeale who following his death in 1622 was buried at St Olave's Church in Exeter.Vivian, Lt.Col.

Eventually he fled to the Island of Barbados.Wotton, 1771 After the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 Berkeley petitioned King Charles II on his behalf as follows:Wotton, 1771 :These are humbly to certify your sacred majesty, that John Colleton, some time of Exeter, Esq; engaged for your majesty's royal father, in the beginning of his troubles, raised and commanded a regiment under me, consisting of about 1,100 men well armed, without any charge to his then majesty or compulsion of his people, which was very 'costly to him, he neither receiving any pay or free quarter to my knowledge, and the soldiers very little of either; that he furnished moneys and arms to a good value when he was driven from his habitation and estate in Cornwall before the battle of Stratton, for which, I am confident, he hath not had satisfaction; that he being chosen a commissioner by the county of Exon for the carrying on the service of your majesty's royal father in the associated counties of the west, did there in good service. That he did, at several other times, procure and lend moneys, and procure and furnish good store of arms and ammunition when his majesty's affairs were in great straits, and gave credit, and stayed long for considerable sums yet unpaid of many of them, whereby a good sum must be due unto him. That he suffered much by your majesty's enemies by being of your part, I believe to the value of above sixty thousand pounds, and he was well contented to stay for his disbursements, and bore his sufferings chearfully, proposing to himself no other satisfaction that I could perceive, than your majesty's restauration. That after your majesty's exile, he was ever active and helpful to your majesty's agents in England in his person and with his purse, which I myself know to be true, and have been informed thereof by divers others. That he forsook England for many years, to avoid the oaths, subscriptions, etc., imposed upon your subjects by your enemies, destructive to your majesty's interest, as I found by him, in Holland, in the year 1650, and returned not until your majesty's restauration. That he hath kept his loyalty unspotted to the last, as far as I can be informed or understand. I am sure he hath done your majesty faithful and good service many ways, and all this in order to his duty and allegiance, without any respect to reward or gain that I could perceive by him. 12th of Dec. 1660. - Jo. Berkeley.Wotton, 1771 =Created a baronet= In recompense for his service during the Civil War, King Charles II in 1661 created him a baronet with territorial designation \\"of London\\".

Colleton brought a group of settlers from the Caribbean Isle of Barbados, who brought with them slaves from Africa thus introducing slavery to Carolina. These settlers introduced the cultivation of rice to the area. Colleton County, South Carolina, is named after him as is Colington, North Carolina.

Coillte manage approximately 7% of the country‚Äôs land, and operates three businesses - their core forestry business, a land solutions business, and a wood panel manufacturing business called 'Medite Smartply'. Operation The company was incorporated in December 1988 and commenced trading in January 1989 when it took over the forestry activities previously carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Shares are held by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Minister for Finance on behalf of the Irish Government. During 2016, the organisation had an average of 862 employees. The Coillte estate is 4,450 square kilometres of which 79% is forest; it manages over 50% of forested land in the country.

It lies along U.S. Routes 280 and 431 between Opelika and Phenix City. It is part of the Auburn Metropolitan Area.  History  Salem was first settled in 1835, and grew rapidly for the next two decades. Salem incorporated in 1846 and quickly became one of the area's largest cities. However, a fire which engulfed the town in 1854 and the subsequent Civil War resulted in the collapse of the town's government, and rapid depopulation. Salem lost a bid to be the county seat of the newly formed Lee County in 1865, and then saw its charter become inactive in the following decades. Today, Salem is a small unincorporated community of a few hundred. By the late 20th century Salem was the location of Lee County's only covered bridge, the Salem-Shotwell Covered Bridge. A symbol of the area, the bridge was destroyed by a fallen tree following a storm in 2005. It was rebuilt in 2007 at Opelika Municipal Park in nearby Opelika. A post office operating under the name Salem was first opened in 1839. Tornado of 2009 On February 28, 2009, at about 8:30 a.m., an EF2 tornado touched down in Salem, destroying Salem Chapel AME church, several homes and part of Wacoochee Junior High School. It also destroyed the Anglican Church of the Resurrection, ACA Mission in the middle of downtown Salem. The church was completed in 2008 in the building that most people knew as the old McLain Museum. This building had been used for several other businesses over many years. The tornado ran east- northeast across part of U.S. Highway 280, which runs through the small community, before lifting up two miles to the east. There were no fatalities and no major injuries reported.

BAPS regards him as the fifth spiritual successor of Swaminarayan, following Gunatitanand Swami, Bhagatji Maharaj, Shastriji Maharaj, and Yogiji Maharaj. He was believed by his followers to be in constant communion with Swaminarayan, and ontologically, the manifestation of Akshar, the eternal abode of Swaminarayan. He received initiation as a Hindu Swami in 1940 from Shastriji Maharaj, the founder of BAPS, who later appointed him as President of BAPS in 1950. Yogiji Maharaj declared Pramukh Swami Maharaj to be his spiritual successor and guru of BAPS, a role he commenced in 1971. As president of BAPS, he had overseen the growth of BAPS from an organization centered in Gujarat, India, to one spread around the world, maintaining many Hindu mandirs and centers outside of India. He built more than 1,100 Hindu temples, including the Swaminarayan Akshardham temples in New Delhi and Gandhinagar, Gujarat. He had also spearheaded the efforts of BAPS Charities, which is the charitable service organization affiliated with BAPS. He was succeeded as the guru and President of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha by Mahant Swami Maharaj. Early years Sketch of Shantilal Patel (Pramukh Swami Maharaj) as a child. Shantilal was born in the village of Chansad, Gujarat, on 7 December 1921. His parents, Motibhai and Diwaliben Patel, were disciples of Shastriji Maharaj and followers of the Akshar Purushottam faith.Sadhu Paramananddas, translated by Sadhu Tilakratnadas (1995?). Searching Questions and Fulfilling Answers: Pramukh Swami Maharaj in Interview. pp. ix-xi. Motibhai and Diwaliben were both involved in the Swaminarayan fellowship; Diwaliben's family's association with the Swaminarayan fellowship extended to the time of Bhagatji Maharaj.Sadhu Shantipriyadas, Pramukh Swami Maharaj Shastriji Maharaj had blessed young Shantilal at birth, and had told his father, \\"This child is ours; when the time is ripe, please give him to us. He will lead thousands to the devotion of God. Through him, thousands will attain liberation.\\" Shantilal's mother described him as a calm and soft-spoken, yet energetic and active child. His childhood friends recall that Shantilal developed a reputation in the town and in school as an honest, reliable, mature, and kindhearted boy. Even as a child, he possessed an uncommon empathy that led others to seek out and trust his opinions and judgments in matters large and small. Shantilal was raised in a simple home environment, as his family was of modest means. Although he excelled in his studies, in the seventeen years he spent at home before becoming a swami, Shantilal only had the opportunity to attend school for six years. As he grew older, Shantilal helped his household by doing chores on the family farm. =Early spiritual inclination= Pramukh Swami Maharaj (left) with his Guru Shastriji Maharaj (right) shortly after entering monastic life at BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Sarangpur (1939). [Photograph by Shankarprasad Mulshankar Trivedi]. Shantilal was strongly inclined towards spirituality from a young age. Upon completing his schoolwork, he would often rush off to the village's Hanuman temple, where he and a childhood friend would listen to the discourses of a Hindu \\"holy man\\" named Haridas. Shantilal's daily ‚Äúdarshan‚Äù, or worship, at the Swaminarayan temple in Chansad, and his association with Shastriji Maharaj and his disciple swamis whenever they came to the village, further reflected Shantilal's affinity for spirituality.Sadhu Aksharvatsaldas, translated by Sadhu Vivekjivandas (2007). Portrait of Inspiration: Pramukh Swami Maharaj. p. xi. . Shantilal took his meals only after having darshan at the Swaminarayan temple. He used to meet other swamis who passed through the village from the holy places of pilgrimage in North India. Swaminarayan swamis, such as Ghanshyam Swami and Balmukund Swami, frequently visited Chansad and other nearby villages; Shantilal regularly engaged in serving them during those visits. As a teenager, Shantilal's bond with Shastriji Maharaj deepened, and his devoutness and intellect impressed many in the fellowship. Those close to Shantilal felt it was only a matter of time until he would embark upon a monastic life by joining the order of Swaminarayan swamis under Shastriji Maharaj. =Entering the monastic life= On 7 November 1939, when Shantilal was seventeen years old, he received a letter from his guru, Shastriji Maharaj, asking him to join the swamis. His parents gave their permission and blessings, and Shantilal left home that day to join Shastriji Maharaj and his swamis. Shastriji Maharaj gave Shantilal primary initiation, parshad diksha, at Ambli-Vadi Pol in Ahmedabad on 22 November 1939, and renamed him Shanti Bhagat. One of Shastriji Maharaj's first requests to the newly initiated Shanti Bhagat was for him to study Sanskrit; Shanti Bhagat complied with this wish, and excelled in his studies. Soon thereafter, on 10 January 1940 at the Akshar Deri in Gondal, Shanti Bhagat was given the bhagvati diksha, initiated as a swami, and named Narayanswarupdas Swami (meaning \\"the form of Narayan\\"). Upon giving him this name, Shastriji Maharaj elaborated, \\"His face carries the brilliance of God, so I name him Narayanswarupdas (the servant of the form of God).\\" Yogiji Maharaj also gave Narayanswarupdasji his blessings, observing, \\"He will surely become great.\\" Renouncing worldly pleasures, Narayanswarupdas Swami adopted vows of celibacy (nishkam), non-covetousness (nirlobh), non- taste (nisswad), non-attachment (nissneh) and humility (nirman) and committed himself to lifelong dedication and service to God and humanity.Sadhu Aksharvatsaldas, translated by Sadhu Vivekjivandas (2007). Portrait of Inspiration: Pramukh Swami Maharaj. p. xvii. . Early years as a swami As a young swami, Narayanswarupdas Swami studied Sanskrit and the Hindu scriptures at Bhadaran and Khambhat, earning the title ‚ÄúShastri‚Äù upon mastering both scripture and philosophy.Raymond Brady Williams (2001). An Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism. Cambridge University Press. . In addition to his studies, Shastri Narayanswarupdas routinely engaged in a multitude of activities, including cleaning the temple compounds, cooking for swamis and devotees, and many other duties. Shastri Narayanswarupdas also played a significant role throughout the construction of the Atladra mandir in the early 1940s. During the construction, he sustained chemical burns and blisters on his body after mixing the lime to be used in construction, yet he persisted unflinchingly in performing his service despite the injuries.Sadhu Paramananddas, translated by Sadhu Tilakratnadas (1995?). Searching Questions and Fulfilling Answers: Pramukh Swami Maharaj in Interview. pp. ix-xi. See also . Serving concurrently as Shastriji Maharaj's personal secretary, Shastri Narayanswarupdas also gained a comprehensive understanding of BAPS‚Äô broader affairs and activities. In 1946, when Shastri Narayanswarupdas was 25, Shastriji Maharaj appointed him the head, or \\"kothari\\", of the large BAPS temple in Salangpur. As head of the temple, Shastri Narayanswarupdas oversaw a major expansion of the temple facilities despite considerable financial constraints. His leadership and unassuming personality in the midst of significant hardships earned him the respect of his fellow swamis and devotees, and presaged the significant responsibility that his guru would soon entrust to him. President of BAPSAppointment as President= Depiction of the ceremony at Ambli Vali Pol in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, where Pramukh Swami Maharaj was appointed president of BAPS in 1951. In the early part of 1950, Shastriji Maharaj wrote several letters to 28-year-old Shastri Narayanswarupdas expressing his wish to appoint him the president of the organization. Twice Shastri Narayanswarupdas wrote back respectfully declining, citing his young age and inexperience, and the presence of many senior swamis who would be more suited to the responsibility. Shastriji Maharaj continued to insist, sending several senior devotees to convince Shastri Narayanswarupdas. Perceiving it to be his guru's inner wish, Shastri Narayanswarupdas ultimately acquiesced. On 21 May 1950 at Ambli-Vali Pol in Ahmedabad, Shastriji Maharaj appointed Shastri Narayanswarupdas, then merely 28 years of age, as the administrative president (\\"Pramukh\\") of BAPS. After that Shastri Narayanswarupdas was widely known as \\"Pramukh Swami.\\" At the ceremony, Shastriji Maharaj placed his own shawl around Shastri Narayanswarupdas's shoulders, and asked Yogiji Maharaj to bless him. Shastri Narayanswarupdas then addressed the group, \\"I feel overwhelmed by the kindness and love showered upon me so lavishly here by my guru, Shastriji Maharaj, and by my mentor Yogiji Maharaj. Always will this day remain sacred for me, in that I am considered worthy of so great a trust and confidence by the two most noble souls of our fellowship, and by you all despite my young age.\\"Brian Hutchinson (1985). The Guru in the Akshar Purushottam Branch of the Swaminarayan Hindu Sect. p. 65. Despite being appointed the president of the organization just hours before, that evening, Shastri Narayanswarupdas was found washing the cooking utensils and dishes used by the devotees who had attended the ceremony. This incident was emblematic of the humble style of servant-leadership that would characterize the next six decades of his presidency.Sadhu Aksharvatsaldas (2008). Eternal Virtues: Spiritual Attributes of Pramukh Swami Maharaj. p.251-259. . =Service under Yogiji Maharaj= Pramukh Swami Maharaj (right) with Yogiji Maharaj (left), then the spiritual head of BAPS, in the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Gondal, Gujarat . He continued to serve as the president of BAPS under guru Yogiji Maharaj after Shastriji Maharaj died in 1951. He became particularly esteemed for his aptitude as an organizer and administrator, fulfilling all of Yogiji Maharaj's goals and dreams for the organization. For instance, he helped Yogiji Maharaj in expanding the faith to England and East Africa in 1960 and 1970, constructing new temples, and instituting new programs within the organization. Throughout these efforts, he remained unassuming in his conduct and uncomplaining during the hardships he encountered. Before dying in 1971, Yogiji Maharaj had explained to swamis and devotees, \\"From now onwards, Pramukh Swami Maharaj will carry on my work‚Ä¶Pramukh Swami is my everything\\". As president and guru of BAPSGlobal growth= Swaminarayan Akshardham, New Delhi (2007) Under his leadership, BAPS rapidly grew into a global Hindu organization and witnessed a significant expansion in many measurable parameters. As of 2019, BAPS encompasses over one million devotees, more than 900 swamis, 3,300 mandirs and congregations, over 7,200 weekly assemblies, and a host of humanitarian and charitable activities. He accompanied Yogiji Maharaj on a tour of East Africa in 1960 as well as in 1970, and embarked upon his first overseas visit as the guru, or spiritual leader, of BAPS in 1974. In the following decades, his 27 international spiritual tours spanned over fifty countries in five continents. =Temples= BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Chino Hills, California (2013) On 4 June 1971, in the village of Sankari, he consecrated the first temple after Yogiji Maharaj's death. After that he inaugurated hundreds of temples and centers around the world, leading to his recognition for having consecrated the greatest number of Hindu temples.Hanna Kim (2010). Public Engagement and Personal Desires: BAPS Swaminarayan Temples and their Contribution to the Discourses on Religion. International Journal of Hindu Studies. p. 2. In total. he consecrated 125 temples abroad, and 1,000 in India. Outside India, such temples include shikharbaddha temples in the metropolitan areas of Houston, Atlanta, Chicago, London, Toronto, and Nairobi.John Zavos (2010). Negotiating Minority/Majority Religious Identity: Exploring the Social Location of a Transnational Religious Organisation in Britain and India. Rindas, The Center for the Study of Contemporary India, Ryukoku University. International Symposium Series 1. p. 104. The temple in the Atlanta metro area is currently recognized as the largest traditional Hindu temple outside the Indian subcontinent.Associated Press, Hindu Temple in Atlanta Suburbs Will Be Largest in U.S., Aug 22, 2007. Available at http://blog.beliefnet.com/news/2007/08/hindu-temple-in-atlanta-suburb.php Within India, he is credited as the inspirer of the Swaminarayan Akshardham complexes in Gandhinagar and New Delhi, itself the world's largest comprehensive Hindu temple. In discussing BAPS‚Äô efforts to construct traditional Hindu temples around the world, Pramukh Swami emphasized the importance of such houses of worship in modern society and values and faith they inspire in members of the community. =Interfaith harmony= Pramukh Swami Maharaj addressing the United Nations Millennium World Peace Summit in New York (2000). In addition to meeting with and providing spiritual guidance to devotees during his international visits, he met with other religious and civic leaders. Brian Hutchinson notes that in speaking with these individuals, the pramukh \\"consistently emphasizes what religions hold in common and advocates cooperation between them with the purpose of uplifting the moral and religious life of mankind\\".Brian Hutchinson (1985). The Guru in the Akshar Purushottam Branch of the Swaminarayan Hindu Sect. pp. 65-66. The sentiments he shared with world religious leaders at the 2000 Millennium World Peace Summit at the United Nations reflected a similar message. In his address, he emphasized the goal of cooperation and mutual respect among religions, for \\"religion is that which spreads love for one another\\". He also expressed a desire that all forms of organized religion be able to coexist in harmony, noting that \\"flourishing together is the secret of peace\\". In particular, he analogized every religion to a goldmine of values from which all people could draw lessons for life. Pramukh Swami also encouraged his fellow spiritual leaders to teach their followers that religion does not grow by quantity of followers, but by quality of spirituality. In his words, \\"a Hindu should become a better Hindu, a Jew should become a better Jew, a Christian should become a better Christian, a Muslim should become a better Muslim. If the follower of every religion becomes a better and true follower then our world will be a much better world\\". This vision of harmony through dialogue characterized his message within BAPS and beyond. During the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat and the terror attack on the Akshardham complex in Gandhinagar, he urged the public to maintain peace and unity.Hindu Press International, Religious Leaders Appeal for Peace in Gujarat, September 26, 2002, available at http://hinduismtoday.com/blogs-news/hindu-press- international/religious-leaders-appeal-for-peace-in-gujarat/2242.html His response and guidance during those times was commended by leaders and commentators, including the National Security commando in charge of the rescue mission during the Akshardham attack, who later asserted that \\"what [the pramukh] did was unbelievable. He pieced society back together\\".Ajay Umat, Akshardham Ideal Terror Response, The Times of India, September 28, 2011 =Celebrating Hindu culture= Cultural Festival of India in Edison, NJ (1991) He led BAPS‚Äô efforts in conducting a number of large-scale cultural festivals, with the aim of fostering better understanding and appreciation of Hindu traditions and promoting moral and spiritual living. The month-long Cultural Festival of India held in Edison, New Jersey during the summer of 1991, for instance, showcased traditional Indian arts, architecture, dance, and music as well as Hindu culture and spirituality, aiming to foster deeper intercultural and interfaith understanding to the over one million visitors who attended. =Swamis= BAPS swamis with Pramukh Swami Maharaj in Sarangpur, Gujarat, India (2016) Beginning with his first swami initiation ceremony in January 1971, during his lifetime he initiated 1,000 youth into the swami fold. Hutchinson observes that his \\"selfless love‚Ä¶was his most frequently and enthusiastically reported characteristic that had influenced persons to become devotees and swamis\\".Brian Hutchinson (1996) The Divine- Human Figure in the Transmission of Religious Transition. Published in Raymond Williams‚Äô A Sacred Thread: Modern Transmission of Hindu Traditions in India and Abroad. Columbia University Press. p. 105. After renouncing worldly ambitions, these swamis were guided by him in their service of God and society. Milestone events in this realm include the bicentenary celebrations of Swaminarayan in 1981 and of Gunatitanand Swami in 1985, which saw the initiation of 200 and 173 swamis, respectively, in a single day. On 14 March 2012, he initiated 68 youths into the monastic order during a ceremony in Sarangpur, Gujarat.  Death  Shrine erected at the place of cremation, Sarangpur He had been suffering from a chest infection in his last days from which he was gradually recovering. However, due to his longstanding heart problems, he died on 13 August 2016, at 6 pm at the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir, Sarangpur, Botad district, Gujarat, India. On 20 July 2012, Pramukh Swami had declared in the presence of senior swamis that Mahant Swami Maharaj would succeed him as the sixth guru and spiritual head of BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha. Significance in BAPS Followers of BAPS believed him to be a manifestation of \\"Akshar\\", the form of the eternal abode of God. As Akshar he was also in constant communion with God. Accordingly, he was considered by devotees to be \\"the perfect servant of God, ‚Ä¶totally filled with God and therefore worthy of reverence and worship\\". =Theological role= BAPS devotees in an assembly in the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The living guru is considered by followers of BAPS to be the ideal swami, the perfect devotee, and the principal target for emulation by all spiritual aspirants. He was often described by followers as a personification of the sacred scriptures. He was viewed as \\"fully brahmanized\\", or having achieved the ultimate level of spiritual development.Brian Hutchinson (1998) The Guru-Devotee Relationship in the Experience of the Members of the Akshar-Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha. Devotees considered him to exemplify all the ideals of the religion; he was viewed as the first disciple, most faithful in his observance of the commandments, most active in propagation of the religion, the best interpreter of the meaning of the scriptures, and the most effective in eradicating the ignorance that separates man from God.Raymond Brady Williams (1996). \\"The Holy Man as the Abode of God in the Swaminarayan Religion\\". In Joanne P. Waghorne and Norman Cutler‚Äôs Gods of Flesh, Gods of Stone: The Embodiment of Divinity in India. Columbia University Press. . His conduct was hence considered to be that of the \\"ideal saint\\" and \\"perfect bhakta (devotee)\\", providing a tangible and graspable example for the spiritual aspirant to follow.Hanna Kim Being Swaminarayan: The Ontology and Significance of Belief in the Construction of a Gujarati Diaspora. Columbia University Press (2001) p.354. Devotees viewed his staunch respect for Shastriji Maharaj and Yogiji Maharaj as the model of devotion to one's guru.A.D. Brear, \\"The Authority of Pramukh Swami within the Swaminarayan Hindu Mission \\" (1996). DISKUS Vol.4, No.1. Swaminarayan Akshardham in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. His practice of carrying the murti of Swaminarayan before him and directing all garlands or offerings presented to him to the image was also seen as a paradigm of humility and selflessness. Similarly, devotees viewed his actions in September 2002, when he appealed for peace and forgiveness of Muslim militants who killed 32 people and injured dozens more in an attack on Akshardham Gandhinagar, to epitomize the Hindu tenet of ahimsa, or nonviolence.John Statton Hawley and Vasudha Narayanan (2006). The Life of Hinduism. University of California Press. pp. 4-5. . His personality and conduct thus served as exemplars for devotees striving to progress personally and spiritually. Followers believed that by associating with him, they might rid themselves of their vices, baser instincts, and worldly attachments. Earning the grace of the guru, devotees believed, would enable them to achieve liberation in which they would escape the cycle of births and deaths and attain \\"Akshardham\\" (God's divine abode). For a devotee of BAPS, he was considered the essential spiritual link with God. According to the teachings of Swaminarayan, devotees consider God (Swaminarayan) to be manifest through Pramukh Swami Maharaj. Thus, his followers believed that by offering devotion to Pramukh Swami, they offer it to Swaminarayan himself. =Spiritual guide= Pramukh Swami Maharaj writing letters to devotees in Gujarat, India. Pramukh Swami Maharaj counseling a young devotee in Gujarat, India. Pramukh Swami was approached by many followers for guidance in all aspects of life. Devotees frequently took to him matters of personal, family, and business affairs and seek his guidance. This type of communication was thought to be an important aspect of the guru- disciple relationship.Raymond Brady Williams (2004). Williams on South Asian Religions and Immigration: Collected Works. Chapter Seven: Guru as Pastoral Counselor. . Accordingly, Pramukh Swami spent much time counseling devotees in person or by letters or telephone. Women could not directly receive advice from Pramukh Swami due to his vows as a swami in the Swaminarayan tradition that prohibit him from interacting directly with females. Women had to ask male relatives to approach Pramukh Swami on their behalf, or had written messages sent to him to ask for guidance. Raymond Williams reports that through such pastoral counseling, \\"Pramukh Swami instructs his followers to believe in God, because without belief in the inspiration of God and faith, nothing is possible\\". Young devotees approaching Pramukh Swami for advice and guidance were often counseled to focus on their education. Williams notes that devotees trust Pramukh Swami's advice due to his theological role as guru and manifestation of Akshar, but also because \\"as a world-renouncer, he is impartial and gains no personal advantage from helping them with decisions.\\" Pramukh Swami had said that the purpose of his providing advice on such a range of matters was not to establish the devotees in business or to enable them to become wealthy, but to relieve them of anxieties about mundane affairs so they could attend to their spiritual progress.

He served as vice-chair of the Commerce Committee, which oversees Los Angeles World Airports, including Los Angeles International Airport. Rosendahl was also a member of the council‚Äôs Transportation Committee, Budget & Finance Committee, and Ad Hoc Committee on Homelessness, which he co-founded. He chaired of the Southern California Regional Airport Authority and one of the city's appointees to the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission. From the time he took office in July 2005, Rosendahl focused upon: stopping the expansion of Los Angeles International Airport, promoting mass transit, enhancing public safety, curbing overdevelopment, standing up for tenants‚Äô rights and for affordable housing, seeking solutions to the problem of homelessness and giving neighborhoods a greater voice in city decision-making. According to some his most notable achievement was the historic agreement between LAX and airport neighbors, ending airport expansion and promoting regional aviation. A resident of Mar Vista, the largest community in the 11th District, Rosendahl was the first openly gay man elected to the Los Angeles City Council, and was the city‚Äôs highest-ranking LGBT official. Prior to his election, Rosendahl was an educator and an award-winning television broadcaster with a long record as a leader in Los Angeles civic affairs. While he served as Distinguished Professor at California State University, Dominguez Hills until his election, Rosendahl is best known as producer and moderator of critically acclaimed public affairs television shows. As host of Local Talk, Week in Review and Beyond the Beltway, Rosendahl created a needed forum for discussion of public affairs. An advocate of empowering people through information, Rosendahl produced more than 3,000 programs over 16 years, opening the airwaves to all viewpoints and steering thoughtful dialogue on the most complex and controversial issues. As a cable executive, Rosendahl fought tirelessly for better service, upgraded technology, more local programming choices, and better wages and working conditions for his employees.

Prior to being elected in May 2005, Rosendahl was an educator, television broadcaster and a vice president at Adelphia. Personal life Rosendahl's parents were immigrants from Germany. They met in New York City, they had three children and moved to Bergenfield, New Jersey to make room for their growing family. Eventually they moved to Englewood, where Rosendahl was born as child number six. His parents would have two more children, for a total of eight. While attending St. Cecilia‚Äôs Catholic School, he was elected president of the junior class and president of the student government. Rosendahl saw this as evidence that he had natural leadership capabilities. He was openly gay during the majority of his adulthood, but struggled with the idea of being gay in his youth. At the age of 29 he took eighteen months off from work and toured around the world, coming to the conclusion that he was gay. At first he was upset about this realization, due to the struggles he would likely endure. Rosendahl had first suspect that he was gay during early puberty in the Boy Scouts. He noticed that he had an attraction to boys instead of girls. He later checked out a book on homosexuality from a local library and learned about the significance of Fire Island and Christopher Street to gay people. Rosendahl would come to the realization later in his life that homosexuality was simply \\"another expression of nature,\\" and no reason to be ashamed. Rosendahl stated in an interview with the Lavender Effect that he was the victim of a gay bashing while in graduate school. He was walking from a gay bar to campus when five men ran up to him screaming obscenities and slurs, and then began beating him. He fought back but received injuries. He filed a police report about the incident. Rosendahl endured discrimination while working at Westinghouse Broadcasting and Cable, where his boss removed his staff and placed him in a windowless office because they expected he was gay. At the age of 32, at his mother's funeral, he came out to his family. He later came out to his boss, the chairman of the board of Century Cable, and found his boss to be accepting. Christopher Blauman and Rosendahl were romantic partners for fourteen years. Blauman died from AIDS in January 1995. Later in life, he and Hedi el Kholti were partners for nearly two decades, until Rosendahl's death. Rosendahl had an affinity for nature, and believed that having a connection to the environment was key to preserving the mental health and vitality of gay people. He kept a garden regularly and considered it key to his survival. In 2012 Rosendahl was diagnosed with stage four cancer. He was told by doctors that he would likely be dead before the upcoming November elections. This pushed him to fight harder for the causes he believed in. Rosendahl received a large amount of support from the public. Visitors from many cultures and religious groups visited him during his illness. He believed this outpouring of support from the public gave him the strength to fight the disease well beyond its expected prognosis. Rosendahl died at his home in Mar Vista, Los Angeles of ureteral cancer on March 30, 2016 at the age of 70.Beloved Westside Councilmember Dill Rosendahl Dies At 70 , laist.com, March 30, 2016.

According to the book, in the very first years of the United States, the Continental Congress granted a \\"perpetual\\" Charter to a secret \\"Commonwealth\\" of privateers, which was founded during the American Revolution and rendered useful service to the young US. In later years, however, these \\"privateers\\" (in fact, pirates) acted mainly for their own private benefit, engaging in manifestly illegal activities while relying on that original Congressional authorization, and strongly resisting any attempt to disband them. In fact, all four US Presidents who were assassinated while in office - Abraham Lincoln in 1865, James A. Garfield in 1881,William McKinley in 1901 and John Kennedy in 1963 - had tried to oppose this \\"Commonwealth\\" and were assassinated as a direct result; the pirates had, in each case, located a person who had a reason to hate the President and manipulated them into unknowingly carrying out their design. Other Presidents, like Woodrow Wilson during WWI and Franklin Roosevelt in WWII, knew of this Commonwealth, recognized its secret role, and made secret use of it - and thus avoided being assassinated. In the book's present, this \\"Commonwealth\\" of privateers/pirates remains active into the 21st Century, and wield considerable power behind the scenes. They no longer derive their profits from outright piracy on the high seas, having shifted into up-to-date lucrative forms of organized crime. But their leader, on board his private yacht, maintains \\"the old pirate traditions\\" such as \\"walking the plank\\" (in an early chapter, this is applied to an unlucky accountant whom the pirate leader wrongly suspected of betrayal). The current President, Cotton Malone's ultimate boss, is determined to put an end to this criminal \\"Commonwealth\\" (and not let himself be assassinated in the process). But first, Malone must complete the delicate task of locating a page torn from the 18th Century Congressional Record, recording the authorization given to the \\"Commonwealth\\". Malone must follow a convoluted trail from the museum in Thomas Jefferson's estate at Monticello, where the Founding Father left a message in code of which the numerous visitors are not aware, and leading to a mysterious seaside cave on a desolate shore, where a glass panel protects an ancient document from the fury of the breaking waves. Only once that centuries-old Congressional authorization been located and destroyed, ensuring that this piece of secret history will remain forever secret, is the President free to act decisively and break up the modern pirates.

She has been lead guitarist and co-vocalist of the alternative rock band The Breeders since 1992, and has formed her own side-projects with bands such as R. Ring and The Kelley Deal 6000. She is the identical twin sister of The Breeders' lead singer Kim Deal.  Early life  Kelley Deal was born in Dayton, Ohio, United States, 11 minutes before her twin sister Kim Deal. The Deal twins grew up in Huber Heights, a suburb of Dayton, Ohio. The sisters first played together in their late teens, Kim playing guitar and both sisters singing Hank Williams songs in biker bars. They both had an opportunity to join the Pixies in the mid-'80s, with Kim on bass and Kelley on drums; Kim followed through while Kelley opted to move to California. While Kim made her mark as an indie rock musician, Kelley worked in computer programming.  Musical career  In 1989, Kim Deal and Tanya Donelly (lead guitarist of Throwing Muses) formed the first incarnation of The Breeders. Kim invited Kelley to join the band for their debut album, Pod, but Kelley could not get time off from work. = The Breeders = In 1992, Kelley joined the band as third guitarist, even though she did not really know how to play. The Safari EP was the first recording on which she appeared. Guitarist Tanya Donelly left to form Belly a little after the release of Safari. Kim suggested Kelley should be the band's new drummer. After Kelley insisted on lead guitar, Kim gave her a crash course on all the songs in the band's set. Kelley picked up quickly and learned all the lead parts on Pod and the new parts on the album they were about to record, Last Splash. A new drummer from Dayton, Jim MacPherson, joined them. After Last Splash was released in 1993, the band toured, opening for Nirvana, and also got a slot on the Lollapalooza tour in 1994. = Other projects = After Last Splash, Kelley started The Kelley Deal 6000. The band released two albums on Eel's Nice Records label, Go To The Sugar Altar in 1996 and Boom! Boom! Boom! in 1997, and went on hiatus when The Breeders were reunited. Kelley also joined The Last Hard Men with Skid Row singer Sebastian Bach, Smashing Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, and Jimmy Flemion of The Frogs. She played bass for them and they recorded an eponymous album in 1997, which was released in a limited edition on Eel's own label, Nice Records, and in 2001 on Spitfire Records. She teamed back up with her sister in the late 1990s and began recording new demos for the Breeders. With a new line up, they released Title TK in 2002. Title TK features three songs recorded in 1999, where the Deal sisters played all the instruments. In April 2008, The Breeders released Mountain Battles. All Nerve followed in 2018. She has been knitting in recent years. She specializes in knitted handbags, which she sells on her website, and appeared on the DIY Network knitting show Knitty Gritty, and in 2008 released a book of her knitting handbag patterns, Bags That Rock: Knitting on the Road with Kelley Deal. One of her patterns is included in the DIY Network's book Knitty Gritty Knits: 25 Fun & Fabulous Projects'. She co-wrote and played guitar on Magnetophone's \\"Kel's Vintage Thought\\". She has also performed duets with Kris Kristofferson and Supersuckers (notably, _Hungover Together_ on Must've Been High), and has also played in the band R. Ring. In January 2020, Deal joined the band Protomartyr as a touring member for their 2020 midwest tour. Deal has previously collaborated on the band's records, doing vocals on 'a couple' of songs.  Legal problems  In 1994, Kelley was arrested for heroin possession; she had been using since she was a teenager. She went through drug rehabilitation throughout the following year. A February 2018 feature article in the New York Times stated that Kelley was then in her eighth year of sobriety.

Career Rosser was asked to join The Vines to replace the band's previous drummer, David Oliffe. He left the Vines, along with guitarist Ryan Griffiths, in December 2011. Rosser started touring with Australian hard rock band Wolfmother in 2012, where the band were looking to start working on their third studio album. After a year of touring with the band, Wolfmother split up temporarily while frontman Andrew Stockdale worked on his solo album Keep Moving. Rosser performed drums and percussion on several tracks for the album.

In November 1923, Richard Boleslavsky, a Russian immigrant and former student of Konstantin Stanislavsky, opened the American Laboratory Theatre, the first school in the United States to teach Stanislavski's system of acting.\\"The Theory and Practice of Actor Training at the American Laboratory Theatre\\", Margueritte Elaine Bryan Brault, University of Arizona, 1979 Hecht was among the first students accepted to attend the new school in late 1923.

Hecht excelled at The Lab and was accepted into its Auxiliary Acting Group, granting him the privilege of appearing in the school's produced plays, while remaining under Boleslavsky's teachings beyond the two years required to graduate.

Selznick clashed with equally positioned Charles Rogers and similar arguments went on between producer William LeBaron and former vice-President Joseph I. Schnitzer. Not only were crew positions scheduled to be cut (as the two studios merged into a single location), but some of the pictures too were cancelled. As part of the agreement, all 20 Path√© pictures in production at the time of the acquisition were to be made at RKO's studio. However, the 16 films on RKO's production schedule were not given the same security and for a variety of reasons, Chi Chi and Her Papas was one of the few to get shut down. LeBaron had already spent $100,000 within the four weeks of pre-production but neither Selznick nor Schnitzer liked the idea of the film and felt it was too racy and non-conducive to the American taste. A few weeks later Hecht found work in the Los Angeles theater business. LeRoy Prinz was producing and directing the Edmunt Joseph and Nat Perrin story Lucky Day with financial backing from Rodney Pantages, Arthur Silber and Harold Morehouse.\\"Amos-Andy Warm?\\", Variety, January 5, 1932, p3 Prinz had clashed with the original choreographer, Billy Grant and Hecht came in to replace him.\\"Hecht Staging\\", Variety, December 8, 1931, p6 Other crew members included Earl Dancer staging the choir with music by Otis Ren√© and Leon Ren√© and lyrics by Ben Eilleon. Lucky Day opened at the Mayan Theater in L.A. on December 27 starring Alex Lovejoy, Eddie Anderson, Alma Travers, LeRoy Broomfield and Aurora Greeley. The play was relatively successful, gaining interest from RKO as a potential property. =Contract choreographer at Paramount= In mid- March 1932 Hecht signed a one-year agreement and became a contract choreographer and dance director for Paramount Pictures.The Daily Notes, March 19 1932, p2 Stories exist that it was his friend Busby Berkeley who helped him get in touch with the right people at Paramount, where the two are said to have worked on films together.\\"Oscar-Winning Producer Dies\\" Los Angeles Times\\", 1985\\"Harold Hecht, Film Producer and a Burt Lancaster Partner\\", The New York Times, May 28, 1985 Hecht's first assignment at Paramount was directing two dance ensembles in the Marx Brothers' college football comedy film Horse Feathers.\\"A Little from Lots\\" The Film Daily, March 24, 1932, p29 One of the numbers Hecht directed was I'm Against It, a scene where Groucho Marx, playing Quincy Adams Wagstaff, is first installed as the new headmaster of Huxley College. Hecht trained Groucho alongside twenty elder actors, aged 61 to 77 years old, with naturally grown beards and dressed in academic gowns.\\"Bearded Veterans' Dance for Groucho\\", Detroit Free Press, April 10, 1932, p35 Considering that his first known assignment at Paramount Pictures was a Marx Brothers film, it is quite possible that Hecht found his way to that studio through Nat Perrin, whom he had just worked with on Lucky Day and was Groucho's close friend and collaborator.\\"Nat Perrin; Movie and TV Writer and Groucho Marx Protege\\", Los Angeles Times, May 14, 1998 Hecht was reported to have worked on additional Marx Brothers films, though no specific titles have surfaced to confirm this (i.e.: \\"Hecht worked on Marx Brothers films\\", in plural form).\\"Harold Hecht, Hollywood Movie Producer\\", St. Petersburg Times, May 29, 1985, p23 If he did work on additional Marx Brothers films, the only plausible ones that were made during the remainder of his first venture in Hollywood were Duck Soup at Paramount in 1933 and A Night at the Opera at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1935.\\"A Night at the Opera\\", Turner Classic Movies, Print Info\\"Duck Soup\\", Turner Classic Movies, Print Info The exact shooting dates for Duck Soup have not been established, but it is known to have been filmed during the summer of 1933, after Hecht's contract at Paramount had expired. It is always possible that the studio reached out to Hecht, though no screen credits were provided for the dance numbers (no screen credits were provided for Horse Feathers either). As for A Night at the Opera, it was filmed at M-G-M Studio in the summer of 1935, during a time when Hecht was associated with the studio. However, the film gives screen credits to Chester Hale for the choreography. Whether Hale worked alone or if Hecht had any input in the film is unknown. Following Horse Feathers, Hecht worked on Lady and Gent (at the time known under the title The Challenge), directed by Stephen Roberts and starring George Bancroft and Wynne Gibson, and Devil and the Deep, directed by Marion Gering and starring Tallulah Bankhead, Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton and Cary Grant.\\"A Little from Lots\\", The Film Daily, May 5, 1932, p7The Pittsburgh Press, July 13 1932, p14 In June and July 1932, Hecht was loaned out from Paramount to M-G-M for the Marion Davies film Blondie of the Follies (then known under the title Good Time Girl). The film was produced by Davies who sought out Hecht herself and was directed by Edmund Goulding, who would later reunite with Hecht. The film also starred Robert Montgomery, Billie Dove and Jimmy Durante.Arcadia Tribune, July 15 1932, p6 Immediately after Lucky Day, Hecht started working on the play Hullabaloo, which took several months of preparation.Arcadia Tribune March 11 1932 Hecht co-directed it with Paul Gerard Smith and choreographed the Gilmor Brown production.\\"Future Plays\\", Variety, May 10, 1932, p50 The production featured music by Ralph Rainger and lyrics by Don Hartman.\\"Hullabaloo\\", Variety, June 21, 1932, p50 Hullabaloo opened on May 26 at the Pasadena Community Playhouse and ran until June 19, with a cast featuring Sterling Holloway, Frank Atkinson, Leonard Sillman and his sister June Carroll. In the fall of 1932, Hecht worked on another theater play, a revised and modernized version of Franz Leh√°r's operetta, The Merry Widow. The play was brought up to date by J. Keirn Brennan with dance numbers by Hecht and vocal numbers by H. L. Heidecker.\\"Plenty Doing Up North In All Branches of Amusement\\", Hollywood Filmograph, November 19, 1932, p10 Karl Hajos composed and conducted the 30-piece orchestra and the cast included Herbert Evans, Ruth Gillette, Alex Callam, Florinne McKinney, Franklin Record, Roland Woodruff, Diane Warfield, Paul Sauter, Rolloe Dix, William Jeffries, Harold Reeves and Evelyn Cunningham. The play opened on Monday November 14 at the Columbia Theater in California. In late November 1932 Hecht became involved in a series of Mae West projects, which all eventually culminated into a single picture.Studio Placements Variety, November 29, 1932, p12\\"A Little from Lots\\", The Film Daily, December 2, 1932, p10 Earlier that year Paramount had signed Mae West to a contract and the actress was eager to step up from the lower-billed role she received in her first picture, Night After Night. She was billed fourth, after George Raft, Constance Cummings and Wynne Gibson. West was working to adapt her notoriously banned play, Diamond Lil, into a film, initially titled Honky Tonk.\\"Hollywood\\", Variety, November 8, 1933, p6 But the censors objected and Paramount worked quickly to change a few scenes, re-title the film to Diamond Lil and tried again to get it into production. The censors objected again, Paramount went back to work and, hoping to fool the censors into thinking they were submitting an all-new film, re-titled the project Ruby Red.\\"Hollywood\\", Variety, November 29, 1932, p6 But the censors found far too many similarities between Ruby Red and Diamond Lil and blocked the production completely. West and Paramount decided to merge Ruby Red into another West film in the writing stages, She Done Him Wrong, using the cast and crew already hired for Ruby Red. This final version of the script made it into production.\\"A Little from Lots\\", The Film Daily, November 14, 1932, p7 Producer LeBaron, who had left RKO to work for Paramount, hired Hecht to work on She Done Him Wrong back when it was still a separate entity from Ruby Red. Hecht was also hired for dance routines on Ruby Red.Mae West: An Icon in black and White, Jill Watts, p151 Ultimately, all of Hecht's material was merged into a single film and used on She Done Him Wrong. The film was directed by Lowell Sherman and starred West, Cary Grant, Owen Moore and Noah Beery. Hecht was interviewed by Motion Picture Magazine in 1933, in response to Mae West's media comments regarding \\"curvy women being the new trend\\", to which he answered in her favor; \\"Dangerous curves are not only ahead, but actually with us. Present-day chorus girls must be slightly more round and more curved than those of a few years ago. Girls with thin, boyish figures definitely are out.\\"\\"The Movie Circus\\", Motion Picture, July 1933, p14 Following the Mae West projects, Hecht became one of the more prominent choreographers in Hollywood and was well-in-demand at Paramount and other studios. In January 1933, Paramount scheduled Hecht for three of their upcoming features: A Bedtime Story (at the time known under the title The Way to Love\\"3 Paramount Title Changes\\", The Film Daily, January 16, 1933, p2), directed by Norman Taurog and starring Maurice Chevalier and Helen Twelvetrees, International House, directed by A.

Fields, Bela Lugosi and George Burns and the highly anticipated blockbuster College Humor.\\"A Little from Lots\\", The Film Daily, January 24, 1933, p3\\"Chevalier Film Opening\\", The Film Daily, April 18, 1933, p2 College Humor, another William LeBaron production, was proclaimed by Paramount's publicity department as \\"the most lavish musical picture since the advent of talking pictures\\". The film was directed by Wesley Ruggles and starred Bing Crosby, Richard Arlen, Mary Carlisle, Jack Oakie, George Burns and Gracie Allen. In addition to working with the main stars, Hecht trained The Ox-Road Co-Eds, a group of sixty chorines, for several original music sequences. He teamed up with Jack Oakie and Boris Petroff to create a new dance, the Fraternity Stomp, which Oakie and Lorna Andre performed in the film.The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, May 21 1933, p25 The new dance was well advertised in newspapers and magazines with a depiction of steps and moves for people to learn it at home.\\"Fraternity Stomp Dance\\", The Zanesville Signal, June 18, 1933, p11 Hecht later stated that he worked with director Frank Tuttle during his days at Paramount. Though no evidence has been found, it is likely that the film he was referring to was The Big Broadcast, starring Bing Crosby, Stuart Erwin, Leila Hyams and George Burns. The Big Broadcast was produced by Benjamin Glazer, who had written A Bedtime Story, and featured music by Ralph Rainger, who had also worked on A Bedtime Story and International House, as well as Hecht's play, Hullaballoo. =Loan-outs to RKO= Shortly before Hecht's Paramount contract expired, producer Lou Brock at RKO borrowed him to direct the dance numbers on the musical Melody Cruise (at the time know under the title Maiden Cruise).\\"Hecht Staging Dances\\", Variety, February 28, 1933, p10\\"Hecht with Brock\\", Hollywood Reporter, February 28, 1933, p8 Hecht put together a number that included a line of 36 girls for the Mark Sandrich film starring Charlie Ruggles and Phil Harris. However, after two weeks of working on Maiden Cruise, Paramount recalled him claiming the RKO production had been delayed and that Hecht's work on Paramount's own International House was a priority.\\"Para. Recalls Hecht\\", The Hollywood Reporter, March 14, 1933, p7 Dave Gould took over Hecht's work on the RKO film and received screen credits for the dance routines.Melody Cruise, IMDB Credits Once Hecht was free from his Paramount contract in April 1933, RKO hired him again, this time to direct the dance numbers on Bed of Roses, a film directed by Gregory La Cava starring Constance Bennett, Joel McCrea, Pert Kelton and John Halliday.\\"Hecht to Radio\\", The Hollywood Reporter, April 27, 1933, p3 For this picture, Hecht trained two hundred girls for the dances and selected the best nine to appear in the film. One number in particular, which took place at the New Orleans Mardi Gras carnival in the film, was taken on the road to help promote the picture, with the girls performing it on stage.The Kane Republican, August 2 1933, p3 Meanwhile, Hecht put on a new play for the \\"Symphonies Under the Stars\\", a week-long festival beginning on July 25. Skyscrapers opened on Saturday July 29 at the Hollywood Bowl to a cast of over one hundred dancers.\\"Hollywood\\", Variety, May 23, 1933, p26\\"Hollywood Bowl\\", Hollywood Filmograph, July 22, 1933, p3 Hecht directed the play and choreographed the dances to music originally composed by John Alden Carpenter. Hecht refashioned the work into an eight scene ballet with the help of Blanding Sloane, who worked on the sets, lights and made the masks, and Kay Otteson who designed the costumes. Richard Lert, husband of Vicki Baum, conducted the orchestra.\\"Harty In his Last Appearance\\", Eagle Rock Advertiser, July 24, 1933, p3Corsicana Daily Sun, September 1 1933, p2 =Freelancing at Warner Brothers, Fox and Universal= In October 1933, Hecht was offered opportunities to direct dance numbers at Warner Brothers, Universal Pictures, Fox Films and Columbia Pictures within a short period of time.\\"Contracts\\", Variety, October 31st 1933, p29\\"Hecht's Fox Switch\\", Variety, October 31st 1933, p2\\"A Little from Lots\\", The Film Daily, October 24, 1933, p6 Hecht first went to Warner Bros. to choreograph a Vitaphone Technicolor two-reeler short, produced by Gordon Hollingshead. Morocco Nights was directed by Edward Cline and starred Fuzzy Knight, Shirley Ross and future Hecht client Francis McDonald. Morocco Nights was initially to be included in Warner's Broadway Brevities but was never added. Scheduled to make an undisclosed Columbia film in 1934 (it has not been established if this plan was fulfilled), Hecht made plans to work at Universal in October 1933 with Stanley Bergerman on I Like It That Way. The film was directed by Harry Lachman and starred Gloria Stuart and Roger Pryor. But shortly before starting production on I Like It That Way in November, Hecht instead opted to go to work on Buddy DeSylva's film Bottoms Up at Fox. The large production was directed by David Butler and starred Spencer Tracy and Pat Paterson with music and lyrics by Gus Kahn.\\"Bottoms Up Produced by B.G. DeSylva Is Credit to Fox Films Standard-David Butler's Direction Excellent\\", Hollywood Filmograph, March 3, 1934, p3 Hecht's numbers in the picture were lauded by critics. In January 1934, Hecht was approached by Universal again, this time for Glamour a film produced by B. F. Zeidman, directed by William Wyler and starring Constance Cummings and Paul Lukas.\\"Hecht on Glamour Dances\\", The Hollywood Reporter, January 22, 1934, p7\\"Hecht on Glamour Steps\\", The Hollywood Reporter, January 31, 1934, p4 In May he was approached by Stanley Bergerman for another Roger Pryor film, Romance in the Rain. This time Hecht provided the dances in the film directed by Stuart Walker.\\"Gorney-Hartman Set\\", The Hollywood Reporter, May 18, 1934, p4Motion Picture Herald, August 11 1934, p34 =Film directing at M-G-M= Hecht is said to have worked on the Edmond Goulding film Hollywood Party (at the time known under the title Star Spangled Banquet) at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in March 1934, though no official credit has surfaced to confirm this. In the fall of 1934 Hecht started working on a series of shorts, which he was to direct, under the title Goonies.\\"Plans New Shorts Series\\", Motion Picture Daily, December 26, 1934, p7 The shorts were to be based on errors made by college students in filing out official forms, hence making them \\"goonies\\". Hecht's new production unit, formed for the purpose of making these shorts in December 1934, was called Goonies Inc. However, the Goonies shorts were never produced, for reasons unknown. In January 1935, Hecht and his friend Josef Berne were given the go ahead to direct their own Technicolor (using the three-strip process) short at Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer. The color process was still considered a novelty at the time, making this deal, for a new director, quite a generous one.\\"Little from Lots\\", The Film Daily, January 22, 1935, p3 Gypsy Night (known under the working title Song of the Gypsies) was produced by Harry Rapf from a story by Richard Goldstone. The short was filmed throughout March and April. Through cinematography and lighting Hecht and Berne \\"emphasized on particular colors which most effectively carried out the moods of the music in each scene\\", a concept that Disney somewhat recreated half a decade later in Fantasia.\\"Sees Musical Sequences in Color in the Future\\", Motion Picture Herald, March 30, 1935, p56 The short was a based on a romantic perspective of the Russian Gypsies' lives, with dance numbers by Hecht and music by Burton Lane and Harold Adamson. The cast featured Mary Jo Mathews, Perry Askam, Joseph Mario and Ilia Khmara. Gypsy Night opened on Friday, May 24, 1935 at the Capitol Theater in New York City.\\"News of Day\\", The Film Daily, May 23, 1935, p4 It was considered avant-garde by some but received generally praising reviews towards its artistic aspect.\\"Reviews of the New Pictures\\", The Film Daily, June 1, 1935, p4\\"Gypsy Night\\", Variety, November 6, 1935, p20 Hecht later claimed that his initial departure from Hollywood was caused by lack of work in the fast-paced, constantly evolving musical pictures business. His style of dances were refreshing when he arrived in 1931. But by 1935 they had been adapted and used by other choreographers and had been well-used at all the major studios. Return to New York and Broadway plays Adelphi Theatre, 1939. Designed by Aida McKenzie. In November 1935, exactly four years after leaving, Hecht returned to New York City and took employment at the Summer Hotel.\\"Purely Personal\\" Motion Picture Daily, November 19, 1935, p2\\"Broadway\\", Variety, November 20, 1935, p68 He was then hired by the Theatre Guild and positioned as assistant director and assistant stage manager for the Leonard Lawrence Atlas play But for the Grace of God in 1936. The play was produced by Sidney Harmon and directed by Benno Schneider.\\"But for the Grace of God\\", Internet Broadway Database Hecht was not the original stage manager of the play and only came in through Schneider's insistence.\\"Testimony of Leopold Lawrence Atlas\\", Hearings, March 12, 1953 But for the Grace of God opened on January 12, 1937 and ran for forty-two performances. It was during this time that Hecht became a member of the Communist Party, subscribing to the Daily Worker and attending select meetings at the New York City Communist Party headquarters on 4th Avenue and the Workers Alliance of America. He also studied five hours a week, taking classes like labor studies, political economy, current events and the rise of Marxism and Leninism. Even though he had a general interest in the party, he was apparently never a devoted Communist and did not seek higher placement or positions. In 1937 he became employed at the Federal Theatre Project and was put in charge of producing the musical revue Sing for Your Supper. It took Hecht two years to get the play together, compiling songs, lyrics, sketches, seeking out writers and hiring the cast, designing costumes, choreographing dances and other aspects of the production. Sing for Your Supper featured an elaborate cast of different ethnicity, nationalities, religious and political beliefs and Hecht showed no discrimination when hiring actors or crew members. During one of the rehearsals, on May 30, 1938, one of the African American cast members approached one of the leading ladies of the play, Viennese actress Sally Saunders, for a date.The Montana Standard, August 21 1938 The actress was so insulted that she rushed to Hecht, asking for the man to be fired. Hecht gloriously championed the rights of blacks by responding to her \\"Sally, I'm surprised at you. He has just as much right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness as you and I have\\".The Ogden Standard Examiner, August 20 1938, p2 Saunders was horrified by Hecht's approval of racial equality and in August of that same year testified against him, the Federal Theater, the Workers Alliance of America and entire production of Sing for Your Supper at an anti- communist hearing in Washington, D.C. Sing for Your Supper eventually opened on either March 15 or April 24 (the date is debated) 1939 at the Adelphi Theatre.Dangerous Theatre: The Federal Theatre Project as a Forum for New Plays, George Kazacoff, Xlibris Corporation, 2011\\"Sing for Your Supper\\", Internet Broadway Database It was reasonably successful, running forty-four performances and closing on June 30. Feeling that his employment at the Federal Theatre would not be renewed after the play, Hecht left New York in either July or August 1939. Second trip to HollywoodNew career as literary agent= In either July or August 1939 Hecht returned to Hollywood and found it difficult to secure employment. He was then living with writer Roland Kibbee and the two became good friends. Kibbee later collaborated with Hecht and Lancaster as a writer for their production companies, and became an equal partner of Lancaster's post-Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions venture, Norlan Productions. In late 1939, after months of unemployment, Hecht was hired by Nat Goldstone as a talent agent for the Goldstone Agency. The Goldstone Agency initially dealt with actors and Hecht established for them a literary department, first becoming head of the new division and then being promoted to a partner in the company. He worked two years for the Goldstone Agency, eventually handling up to thirty-six writers. Hecht hired one of these writers, George Willner, to be his assistant. Willner later formed his own literary agency. =World War II service= Hecht enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps on August 29, 1942 in support of World War II.Harold Hecht Army Registration Record His army serial number was 19126700. He was promoted to the rank of staff sergeant and placed in Special Services, the entertainment department. He produced live shows for servicemen with in person appearances by some of the biggest stars of the day: including songwriter Johnny Mercer, vocalist Francis Langford, Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and personal friend, actor John Garfield. Hecht was honorably discharged on September 3, 1945. =Formation of the Hecht-Rantz Agency= After his service in World War II, Hecht returned to Hollywood with plans to head his own talent agency. In the fall of 1945 he formed the Hecht-Rantz Agency with friend and former Goldstone Agency employee, Louis Rantz. Rantz had also worked in Hollywood during the mid-1930s, as an associate producer, mostly with Metropolitan Pictures, George A. Hirliman Productions and B.F. Zeidman Productions. Hecht and Rantz set up their office at 324 South Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, California.\\"Edith Barrett Listing\\", Film Daily Year Book, 1947, p491 During a show-going holiday in New York City in late November 1945, Lillian Schary, Dore Schary's sister, suggested to Hecht that he go see a new Broadway play at the Lyceum Theater. A Sound of Hunting, which had opened off-Broadway a couple of weeks earlier, was showcasing a brand new actor, Burt Lancaster. Hecht was immediately impressed with Lancaster's performance. He later said of that night \\"When I saw Burt Lancaster in A Sound of Hunting on Broadway (in 1945), I knew he had it. I don't know how you could miss it. He was so dominating, so much larger than life\\".The Indianapolis Star, May 23 1967, p14 Hecht attended the play many more times before it closed after twenty-three performances on December 8.Burt Lancaster Broadway Credits, IBDB When nearly all the major Hollywood studios starting coming at Lancaster with offers, his friend and co- star in the play, Sam Levene, an established stage and film actor, offered to represent him.The Tennessean, May 22 1955, p63 Together they were invited to restaurants, hearing offers from David O. Selznick, 20th Century-Fox and Hal B. Wallis, who had a deal at Paramount Pictures.Burt Lancaster ‚Äì An American Life, Kate Buford, Da Capo Publishing, 2000 Stories are told about the time Hecht was introduced to Lancaster on the last night of the play. The actor said he'd been courted by the big agencies. Hecht told him, \\"If you sign with a big agency, you'll be assigned to a junior agent who gets a salary, and has two dozen unknowns to find work for.\\" Hecht opted for honesty. \\"I know everybody, but I have only a few clients. If you signed with me, you'd be at the top of my list and I have to eat so I'd have to keep you working\\". Lancaster signed with Hecht and they went out to celebrate at a restaurant. There Hecht said, \\"You know, I really don't like being an agent. I want to produce pictures\\". Lancaster replied that he wanted the same, which led to Hecht's famous retort, \\"Come with me and in five years maybe we can make it\\". The actual time was 19 months. Through Hecht's negotiations, Lancaster signed a seven-year contract, the longest term a studio was legally allowed to keep an actor under contract at the time, with Hal B. Wallis' Paramount-financed, independent production company, Hal Wallis Productions. The exclusive contract gave Lancaster an option for one outside, independent picture a year, giving the agent/actor room to produce a yearly film, thought they initially never believed the clause would be used.Arizona Republic, June 24 1956, p42 A few months later, in April 1946, Hecht and Lancaster were sitting in the bar of the Barbizon-Plaza Hotel in New York City, having a last drink before Lancaster was off for the filming of The Killers for Mark Hellinger Productions. Lancaster was worried about the kind of movies he'd be getting in Hollywood when Hecht jokingly told him \\"Well Burt, if you don't like what you get into out there, we'll just produce our own films. That's the one way you're sure to get what you want!\\". Throughout the 1940s, every actor, producer and director wanted to start their own production company but few were able to accomplish it due to contractual obligations. The few that did manage to venture into productions of their own, most often did not last long enough to make an impact and rarely made more than a handful of movies. Rantz and Hecht also managed actresses Edith Barrett, Frances Rafferty and Karen Morley and actors Roman Bohnen and Phil Brown in 1945 and 1946. In 1946 the company dissolved and Rantz formed the Louis Rantz Agency. Prosperity in HollywoodHarold Hecht Productions= In 1946 Hecht formed his own company, Harold Hecht Productions, and set up his new office at 8747 Sunset Boulevard West in Hollywood. The new name reflected what he and Lancaster hoped to accomplish; producing movies. However, Harold Hecht Productions also had an agency division and he retained many of the actors and writers already under contract with the Hecht-Rantz Agency. Hecht also signed new talents such as actors Art Smith and Francis McDonald and writers Walter Bernstein, Roland Kibbee and Meta Rosenberg.Making of the Magnificent Seven, Brian Hannan, p247\\"Roman Bohnen Listing\\", Film Daily Year Book 1948 During this time Hecht became an officer at Irving Mills' music publishing company, Mills Music Inc., though little is known of his work there.The Billboard, November 15 1947, p67 By 1947, Harold Hecht Productions was doing very well as a talent agency and Hecht started hiring staff from other noted Hollywood agencies. In May 1947, E. Henry Lewis left the Goldstone Agency to head Harold Hecht Productions' literary staff.\\"Hollywood\\", Variety, May 21, 1947, p63 =Norma Productions and Halburt Productions= In the summer of 1947 Hecht co-founded Norma Productions with Burt Lancaster, who named the company after his second wife, Norma Anderson. They worked out a deal with Universal-International, for whom Lancaster had already done The Killers and Brute Force, both for Mark Hellinger Productions. Hecht and Lancaster's first production was Kiss the Blood Off My Hands, a film noir based on British author Gerald Butler's best- selling novel. The movie starred Lancaster, Joan Fontaine and Robert Newton and was directed by Norman Foster, famous for the Mr. Moto crime series starring Peter Lorre, with a soundtrack by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa, a noted film noir composer. Kiss the Blood Off My Hands, a co-production through Norma Productions and Harold Hecht Productions, was released in late 1948 to moderate success. Following this, Hecht worked exclusively through Norma Productions for the next ten years. In early 1949 Norma Productions made a three-picture deal with Warner Brothers Pictures, all to be produced by Hecht and to star Lancaster. The inaugural picture was The Flame and the Arrow, a Technicolor swashbuckler directed by Jacques Tourneur. The big-budget film featured some of the biggest names from the Warner Brothers lot at the time, including Virginia Mayo (fresh from White Heat) as the leading lady and Max Steiner (famous for Casablanca and Gone with the Wind) who was hired to compose the soundtrack. The Flame and the Arrow was released in the summer of 1950 and became one of the year's top grossers, earning two nominations at the 23rd Academy Awards ceremony in March 1951; one for Best Dramatic or Comedy Score (Max Steiner), another for Best Color Cinematography (Ernest Haller). Hecht's next production for Warner Brothers was The Crimson Pirate, another Technicolor swashbuckler starring Lancaster and Nick Cravat, a close friend since boyhood, and former acrobat who had worked with Lancaster in the circus (he had also co-starred in The Flame and the Arrow). It was directed by Robert Siodmak, written by Roland Kibbee and featured an early appearance by Christopher Lee. The Crimson Pirate was made entirely in remote locations, with filming in Ischia, an island off the Gulf of Naples, Italy and at Teddington Studios in England. Released in the fall of 1952, it also went on to be a top-grosser for Warner Brothers. Years later Hecht attempted to develop a sequel, Jolly Roger: Son of the Crimson Pirate, but this film was never made. Before completing their contract at Warner Brothers, Hecht and Lancaster signed a two-picture deal with Columbia Pictures through the Norma Productions subsidiary, Halburt Productions. The two moderate-budget Columbia films were shot back-to-back at Columbia Studios and marked the beginning of a professional relationship between Hecht, Lancaster and Robert Aldrich, who was Hecht's assistant producer at the studio. Halburt Productions' first film, Ten Tall Men (released in late 1951) was another Technicolor adventure flick about the French Foreign Legion during the Rif War in Morocco. It was written and directed by Willis Goldbeck, co-written by Roland Kibbee and starred Lancaster, Jody Lawrance and Gilbert Roland. It also featured memorable parts by character actors George Tobias, Nick Dennis, Mike Mazurki and Robert Clary. But the real turning point was when Columbia allowed Hecht and Lancaster to produce their first film without Lancaster acting in it. The First Time (released in early 1952) was a comedy film directed by Frank Tashlin starring Robert Cummings and Barbara Hale, based on a short story by Hugo Butler and Jean Rouverol as first-time parents. Hecht's final Warner Brothers commitment was His Majesty O'Keefe, filmed in mid-1952 but only released in early 1954. His Majesty O'Keefe was granted another large budget for remote location shooting in Technicolor. This time the crew headed to Viti Levu in the Republic of Fiji, where production costs skyrocketed. The film was directed by Byron Haskin and starred Lancaster, Joan Rice and Andr√© Morell. It was scored by Dimitri Tiomkin and was the first time that Hecht and Lancaster collaborated with writer James Hill who later became a partner in the company. In December 1952 Hecht joined the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.\\"18 Added to Academy\\", Box Office, December 20, 1952, p56 =House Un-American Activities Committee testimony= Harold Hecht's name was given to the House Un-American Activities Committee by Martin Berkeley on September 19, 1951. At the time that Hecht's name was brought up, he was in Italy working on Norma Productions' The Crimson Pirate for Warner Brothers and a subpoena for his testimony was only procured two years later. On March 23, 1953, Hecht appeared in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee, represented by his lawyer Edward Bennett Williams. Many of the writers, actors and directors that Hecht and Lancaster had worked with through Norma Productions and Halburt Productions had been named as known or suspected Communists and the Committee was eager to hear Hecht's side of the story. Hecht cooperated with the Committee on every aspect, feeling no shame about his past and answering all their questions regarding his affiliation with the Communist Party. Hecht admitted to once being a member of the Communist Party but informed the Committee that he was no longer of that state of mind. Because of his cooperation with the Committee and his testimony of known Communists from his past, Hecht was not blacklisted and was allowed to resume his position as a successful producer in Hollywood. =Hecht-Lancaster Productions= In the summer of 1953 Hecht co-founded another Norma Productions subsidiary, Hecht- Lancaster Productions, with Burt Lancaster and signed a two-picture deal with United Artists (the deal would be renegotiated and extended several times over the next few years). Their first production for UA was Apache (released in the summer of 1954), a western told from the perspective of a Native American Apache. It starred Lancaster and Jean Peters with a feature role by John McIntire and an early appearance by Charles Bronson (credited under his real name, Charles Buchinsky). Robert Aldrich was hired as director and James R. Webb wrote the script from an original novel by Paul Wellman. Apache was another box office success for the company and despite the controversy that both leading actors had striking blue eyes, the film met with the approval of Native Americans, who were consulted at private screenings prior to the opening dates. Apache was followed by Vera Cruz, another western, based on the Mexican Revolution. This was another top-budget Technicolor picture and one of the earliest films to use the widescreen format, using the SuperScope process. Hecht's production company traveled to Mexico and filmed entirely on location, including scenes at the famous Chapultepec Castle. Robert Aldrich and James R. Webb returned as director and writer with Roland Kibbee coming in to help with the script. It starred Lancaster and Gary Cooper with featured roles by Denise Darcel, Sara Montiel, Cesar Romero, George Macready, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson (again credited as Charles Buchinsky), Jack Elam and Jack Lambert. Vera Cruz became Norma Productions' top grosser and one of UA's best box office success, earning over $11 million and boosting Hecht and Lancaster to the top as Hollywood's most prominent independent producers, a position they would keep for five years. Vera Cruz was later considered as one of the potential TV shows that Hecht-Lancaster Productions was to produce and they hired a young western TV writer, Sam Peckinpah, to write a teleplay. But the pilot was never produced. After Vera Cruz, Hecht-Lancaster Productions delivered three more successful box office films financed by UA. One of the best remembered films of the 1950s, Marty was originally a television episode on The Philco Television Playhouse. The teleplay was written by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by Delbert Mann. Hecht hired both of them to develop the story into a movie and approached Ernest Borgnine, who had never been given a starring role in a film, to play the lead. Gene Kelly's wife, Betsy Blair, won the role of the love interest, bringing her out of the HUAC blacklist. Marty was produced as a low-budget film, shot mostly on location in New York City, with a bank roll of a little over $250,000 (with an additional $100,000 for advertising and publicity). When the film was released in the spring of 1955, and was paired with a major promotional plan, it became another top-grosser. The film won numerous awards including the Academy Award for Best Picture (Harold Hecht), the Academy Award for Best Director (Delbert Mann), the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Ernest Borgnine), the Academy Award for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay (Paddy Chayefsky), the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Drama, the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor, the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress, the Bodil Award for Best American Film, the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival (the first film to technically win the Palme d'Or, as the top prize had recently changed title, and also the first film to win by unanimous votes), the Cannes Film Festival OCIC Award, the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures, the National Board of Review Award for Best Film, the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor, the National Board of Review Award for Top Ten Films, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor, the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Drama. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, Black-and-White, the Academy Award for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White and the BAFTA Award for Best Film from any Source. Hecht's Best Picture Oscar statue was presented to him by Audrey Hepburn. His acceptance speech is among the most memorable and most quoted; \\"It's very fortunate to live in a country where any man, no matter how humble his origins, can become a president, and to be part of an industry where any picture, no matter how low its budget, can win an Oscar. All of us who worked on Marty are especially fortunate for this great honor, for to us, from the very beginning, it was a labor of love. Thank you\\". In November 1959 Marty was the first American film to be screened in the USSR following World War II. It was personally selected by Russian politicians as part of a Soviet- American cultural exchange program, and Hecht was asked by President Eisenhower to travel to Russia for the screening of the film. In 1994 Marty was selected by the National Film Preservation Board for preservation in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry.National Film Preservation Board, List of Films Marty was also one of the many films considered by Hecht- Lancaster Productions to be made into a television show. An original pilot was made with Shecky Greene in the late 1950s and later (unrelated to Hecht-Hill- Lancaster Productions) with Tom Bosley. Neither were sold to the networks. Hecht-Lancaster Productions' second film to be released in 1955 was The Kentuckian, another large-budget adventure film shot in Technicolor using the CinemaScope widescreen technology on location in the Kentucky mountains. the screenplay was written by Pulitzer Prize-winning author A. B. Guthrie Jr. from Felix Holt's novel The Gabriel Horn and was Burt Lancaster's official directorial debut. Guthrie had already famously adapted Shane in 1952 and his novel, The Big Sky, was made into a successful Western by Howard Hawks that same year. Hecht and Lancaster hired famed composer Bernard Herrmann for the soundtrack, already renowned at the time for his work with Orson Welles. Herrmann is now best remembered as a close collaborator of Alfred Hitchcock, composing the soundtracks to Psycho, Vertigo and North By Northwest. In addition to starring Lancaster, The Kentuckian featured Dianne Foster, Diana Lynn, John McIntire and was the film debut of Walter Matthau, who played the heavy. As part of its publicity, Hecht hired artist Thomas Hart Benton to paint a life-sized portrait of Lancaster and Donald MacDonald (in character), posing with their dog Faro. The painting, also known as The Kentuckian, has been exhibited at a number of museums over the years and is currently part of Los Angeles County Museum of Art's permanent collection.Kansas City Performing Arts The film competed at the Venice Film Festival for its top prize, the Golden Lion Award. The last film released under the Hecht-Lancaster Productions banner (prior to changing the company's name) was the massively budgeted circus film Trapeze. Also filmed in Technicolor with CinemaScope lenses, the film starred Lancaster, Tony Curtis and Italian sex symbol Gina Lollobrigida. The script went through a number of writers including James Jones (From Here to Eternity), Ernest Lehman, Ben Hecht, James R. Webb, Wolf Mankowitz and Liam O'Brien. Trapeze was shot in Paris, France with locations such as the indoor arena Cirque d'Hiver, with recently knighted director Sir Carol Reed. The film is noted for having the largest promotional allowance of the times, with a reported $2 million for publicity. It paid off and was the third best box office earner of the year. Many of its premieres featured local circus performers who were hired to parade through the streets. Though it failed to make an impact at the Academy Awards, it won several awards including the Bambi Award for Best Actress ‚Äì International, the Berlin International Film Festival Silver Berlin Bear Award for Best Actor, the Berlin International Film Festival Bronze Berlin Bear Award for Audience Poll and a nomination for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures. On June 12, 1956, Hecht joined the Screen Producers Guild as their 150th member.\\"SPG Membership At All-Time High\\", Motion Picture Daily, June 13, 1956, p2 That year he also returned to Broadway to bring English playwright Terence Rattigan's hit show Separate Tables to the American stage, with plans to turn it into a film for Hecht- Lancaster Productions. The Broadway production opened on October 25, 1956 and was highly successful, running for 332 performances at the Music Box theatre and closing on September 28, 1957.Separate Tables, Internet Broadway Database The play was directed by Peter Glenville and starred Margaret Leighton, Eric Portman, Donald Harron, Beryl Measor, Phyllis Neilson-Terry, Helena Carroll and May Hallatt. It was nominated for seven Tony Awards at the 11th ceremony in April 1957, winning one for Margaret Leighton as Best Actress. The other nominations included Best Play (The Producers Theatre and Hecht-Lancaster Productions), Best Actor (Eric Portman), Best Featured Actor (William Podmore), two for Best Featured Actress (Beryl Measor and Phyllis Neilson- Terry) and Best Direction (Peter Glenville). =Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions= In 1956 Burt Lancaster announced that writer James Hill was made an equal partner in the company. The new name officially came into effect at the beginning of 1957, with Hecht-Lancaster Productions being updated to Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions. The first film released under the new name was The Bachelor Party (released in the spring of 1957), another Paddy Chayefsky dramatic teleplay adapted for the screen with hopes to recreate the success of Marty. Delbert Mann was hired again as director with Alex North composing the soundtrack. The film starred E. G. Marshall, Don Murray and Jack Warden with a notable featured part for actress Carolyn Jones who later portrayed Morticia Addams in the television series The Addams Family. Carolyn Jones played the role of a beatnik at a party and made a considerable impact with viewers. The Bachelor Party won a National Board of Review Award and was nominated for the Palme d'Or Award at the Cannes Film Festival, the BAFTA Award for Best Film from any Source and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role (for Carolyn Jones). One of today's best remembered film from Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions is Sweet Smell of Success, released in late 1957. Though it was a flop at the box office when first released, it has since grown to become one of the most iconic films of the 1950s and has been referenced as a major influence for critically acclaimed directors, including Barry Levinson (who made references to it in his films Diner and Rain Man) and Martin Scorsese. The New York City-based (and filmed) drama represented Hecht and Lancaster's return to the film noir genre since their first picture, Kiss the Blood Off My Hands. It starred Lancaster and Tony Curtis (who also co- produced the film through his production company Curtleigh Productions) from a screenplay by Ernest Lehman and Clifford Odets (who was at the time under contract to Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions). Director Alexander Mackendrick was hired with top cinematographer James Wong Howe and composer Elmer Bernstein (fresh from working on Otto Preminger's The Man With the Golden Arm) wrote a memorable soundtrack. The film won the Bambi Award for Best International Actor and was nominated at the British Academy Film Awards for the Best Foreign Actor, the Golden Laurel Award for Top Male Dramatic Performance and the Golden Laurel Award for Top Female Supporting Performance. In 1993 it was selected by the National Film Preservation Board for preservation in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry. It also appeared on Roger Ebert's \\"Great Movies\\" list and was added to the Online Film & Television Association Hall of Fame. It was also released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection. In 2002 it was made into a Broadway musical by Marvin Hamlisch, Craig Carnelia and John Guare. In early 1958 Hecht-Hill- Lancaster Productions released Run Silent, Run Deep, a black-and-white submarine war film based on the best-selling novel by highly decorated US Navy officer Edward L. Beach Jr.. Directed by Robert Wise, it starred Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster with featured roles by Nick Cravat, Jack Warden and Don Rickles (in the comedian's film debut). Always hiring top personnel, the script was written by John Gay and the music was composed by Franz Waxman. Cinematographer Russell Harlan was nominated for a Golden Laurel Award for his work on the film. The film version of Separate Tables (released in late 1958) was another major winner at the awards ceremony. The film was adapted for the screen by Terence Rattigan, John Gay and John Michael Hayes and reunited Delbert Mann for a third turn directing for Hecht. Separate Tables featured an all-star cast with David Niven, Rita Hayworth, Deborah Kerr, Burt Lancaster, Wendy Hiller, Gladys Cooper and Rod Taylor (several years before his best- remembered role in The Birds). The film was originally set to be directed by Laurence Olivier, who was to play Lancaster's role, with his wife, Vivien Leigh, in place of Hayworth. This film earned Hecht his second Academy Awards nomination for Best Picture. The film won several awards including the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (David Niven), the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Wendy Hiller, which Hecht accepted in her place as she could not be present), the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Drama, the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actress, the Golden Laurel Award for Top Male Dramatic Performance, the National Board of Review Award for Top Ten Films, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and the Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Actor. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, the Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, Black-and-White, the Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Drama, the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, the Golden Laurel Award for Top Female Dramatic Performance, the Golden Laurel Award for Top Female Supporting Performance, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Screenplay and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Drama. That year producer James Hill and star Rita Hayworth were married. Two limited-budget productions followed Separate Tables: The Rabbit Trap and Cry Tough, both released in 1959. The Rabbit Trap was anticipated as another box office winner, as with Marty, based on a teleplay by JP Miller who adapted his story for the film. British film director Philip Leacock was brought over for the Ernest Borgnine starrer, with Don Rickles in a featured role. But the film only made an impact at the Locarno International Film Festival where Borgnine won the award for Best Actor. Cry Tough was initially set to be a big-budget picture starring Tony Curtis (also to be co-produced by his independent production company), but it eventually starred John Saxon instead. Television director Paul Stanley made his film directorial debut and the movie was topped by one of the first \\"Jazz Samba\\" soundtracks, composed by guitarist Laurindo Almeida. One of Hecht's most coveted film rights purchases came when he procured The Devil's Disciple from Nobel Prize-winner George Bernard Shaw's estate. Set in Colonial America, the story tells of the American Revolutionary War. Initially planned for a 1956 production, the film was to star Lancaster, Montgomery Clift and Laurence Olivier, with Olivier also directing. But Lancaster decided he didn't want to be directed by another actor. Plans were delayed and Clift's part was recast with Kirk Douglas and Olivier dropped out from directing. Instead, Alexander Mackendrick was hired as director, but he was later fired shortly after filming began. Mackendrick was replaced by future James Bond director Guy Hamilton. The film was partly shot at the famous Ealing Studios in England, from a script by Roland Kibbee and John Dighton. It also earned a BAFTA Award nomination for Best British Actor (for Olivier). While The Devil's Disciple was shooting in England, Hecht-Hill- Lancaster Productions was simultaneously producing Summer of the Seventeenth Doll in Australia. The film was based on Ray Lawler's successful dramatic play about sugarcane cutters in Australia, but was greatly re-written and Americanized by screenwriter John Dighton. It was directed by Leslie Norman and starred Ernest Borgnine (his final collaboration with Hecht and Lancaster), Anne Baxter, Angela Lansbury and John Mills. The film was released in Australia in late 1959 but was only released in the US in late 1961, under the title Season of Passion. A long-time supporter of racial equality, Hecht then made Take a Giant Step, a coming-of-age drama film dealing with the realities of racism in American schools. Hecht hired pop singer Johnny Nash (later immortalized by his 1972, No.1 hit single I Can See Clearly Now) to play the lead with Philip Leacock directing. Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions was hoping to make an impact in the film industry, while African American civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. were protesting in the streets with the same message. But the film was plagued by delays and resistance from United Artists who initially refused to finance it (it was advanced in full by Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions from their other films' profits), then refused to release it, and who finally shelved it after a limited distribution. Still, the film won the Silver Sail Award at the Locarno International Film Festival in Italy and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Film Promoting International Understanding and the BAFTA United Nations Award. The Unforgiven was the last film shot during Hecht-Hill-Lancaster's status as a working and successful unit and was released in the spring of 1960, by which time the company had dissolved (prior to their limited comeback a year later). The western, filmed using the Panavision Technicolor widescreen lenses on location in Durango, Mexico, dealt with racial intolerance towards Native Americans. The film was filled with star names including director John Huston, former blacklisted writer Ben Maddow (who adapted the screenplay from a novel by Alan Le May), and actors Lancaster, John Saxon, Charles Bickford, Audie Murphy (who replaced Tony Curtis after he dropped out), Albert Salmi and Joseph Wiseman and actresses Audrey Hepburn and Lillian Gish. Production was delayed for months when Hepburn fell off a horse and injured her back. =Music industry venture= In July 1956, Hecht, his brother-in-law Loring Buzzell (brother of Hecht's first wife Gloria) and Lancaster formed two music publishing firms; Hecht-Lancaster & Buzzell Music (copyrighting exclusively through ASCAP) and Calyork Music (copyrighting exclusively through BMI).\\"Buzzell Ties with Hecht & Lancaster\\", Billboard, March 16, 1957, p8 The purpose of the new venture (a subsidiary of the Hecht and Lancaster Companies/Norma Productions) was to publish and copyright songs from their films' soundtracks and license them to record labels for release in the booming business of vinyls for the home market. The compositions published through Hecht-Lancaster & Buzzell Music and Calyork Music have been released through Columbia Records, Warner Bros. Records, MGM Records, ABC-Paramount Records, Capitol Records, London Records, United Artists Records, Decca Records, Mercury Records, RCA Victor Records, Jubilee Records, Coral Records, Top Rank Records, Date Records, Kapp Records, Apollo Records, Maine Records and Cabot Records. Hecht-Lancaster & Buzzell Music and Calyork Music also published songs from non-film related composers, who in turn had their work adapted and recorded by musicians and gained royalties. One notable non-movie hit that Hecht-Lancaster & Buzzell had was the McGuire Sisters's version of May You Always which peaked to No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 list in January 1959 and became the second best-selling sheet music in the US.\\"Reviews of New Pop Records\\", Billboard, November 24, 1958, p42\\"Hot 100\\", Billboard, January 26, 1959, p40\\"Best Selling Sheet Music in US\\", Billboard, March 16, 1959, p44 Some of the notable soundtracks published through Hecht-Lancaster & Buzzell Music and Calyrok Music include Trapeze, Sweet Smell of Success, Cry Tough and The Unforgiven. The soundtrack to Sweet Smell of Success was quite notable and critically important as it was the first film to feature two completely different soundtracks released on LP; one with Elmer Bernstein's score, the other with Chico Hamilton's jazz band.\\"2 Soundtracks for Same Flick\\", Billboard, June 17, 1957, p29\\"Decca Debuts Double Feature\\", Billboard, July 1, 1957, p25 =Plans after Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions= When Hecht-Hill- Lancaster Productions announced a hiatus (which eventually led to their breakup) in the spring of 1959, Hecht was approached with two offers. The first was for a major executive position at Paramount Pictures as Production Chief, replacing Young Frank Freeman.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 9 1959, p22 But Hecht had enjoyed the freedom of being an independent producer for twelve years and was reluctant to deal with a major Hollywood studio's problems. He had also been offered a similar position at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer two years earlier and hadn't accepted it for the same reasons. He turned down Paramount's offer and the position was eventually filled by Jack Karp.\\"Studio Boss Resigns\\", The Gazette and Daily, May 18, 1959, p25 The second proposal interested him much more. Producer Alan J. Pakula had purchased the film rights to Elliott Arnold's action novel, Flight from Ashiya, and approached Hecht to co-produce it.\\"Harold Hecht Schedules His First Solo Film\\" Boxoffice, May 11, 1959, p18\\"Alan Pakula to Produce Series for Mirisch Co.\\", Boxoffice, June 15, 1959, p17 Hecht and Lancaster had previously purchased the screen rights to one of Arnold's Western books, Blood Brother, and came very close to turning it into a picture (it was eventually made as Broken Arrow with James Stewart). Pakula commissioned Arnold to adapt Flight from Ashiya into a screenplay while Hecht approached such stars as Clark Gable, Ronald Reagan and Tuesday Weld for the leads.\\"Pre-Sold Properties\\", Boxoffice, July 25, 1960 But that summer Hecht became involved with other film projects that soon took on priority and it would be four years before Flight from Ashiya was filmed, with a different script and an all-new cast including Yul Brynner. On top of promoting a backlog of Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions films that were coming out in 1959‚Äì1960 (The Rabbit Trap, Cry Tough, Summer of the Seventeenth Doll, The Devil's Disciple, Take a Giant Step and The Unforgiven), Hecht was busy planning future United Artists-financed films from the H-H-L unit (including The Way West). He also formed a new film production company with Canadian actor Glenn Ford. Their first film together was to be Evan Hunter's novel, A Matter of Conviction, concerning members of a Harlem street gang tried for murder (later released as The Young Savages).\\"Perfect for Lana\\", The Milwaukee Sentinel, June 30, 1959, p22 Glenn Ford had already starred in another Hunter adaptation, Blackboard Jungle; the film was nominated for four Oscars. Hecht was hoping that the new combo would be as successful and hired more top Hollywood personnel to work on The Young Savages; John Gay to write the screenplay and Robert Rossen to direct.\\"H-H-L Have Parted But Two to Come\\", Films and Filming, September 1959, p271 But by the end of the year, Glenn Ford had left the project and in early 1960 Rossen dropped out to focus on his future Oscar-nominated film, The Hustler. Many of the projects that Hecht worked on between 1959 and 1964 shifted back and forth between independent solo productions and Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions ventures. Because of a financial deficit owed to United Artists when Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions decided to call it quits in 1959, the three partners were obligated to make a number of films for the studio in an attempt to recoup the costs. Some of the films were to be as individuals, others were required to be under the Hecht- Hill-Lancaster Productions banner. In that manner, The Young Savages became a Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions film when Burt Lancaster was cast in the lead, replacing Glenn Ford, in early 1960. Birdman of Alcatraz film poster. Norma Productions, 1962 With Lancaster in the picture, The Young Savages headed in a new direction. Hecht hired J.P. Miller, who had worked on The Rabbit Trap and had since been nominated for an Emmy Award, and Edward Anhalt, a two-time Academy Award nominee who had won a Best Screenplay Oscar for the 1951 film Panic in the Streets, to rewrite the script. Meanwhile, Lancaster approached respected young television director John Frankenheimer who had already done a low-budget picture, The Young Stranger, a few years prior but The Young Savages has since been considered by most as his true film debut. Lancaster and Frankenheimer would make a total of five films together. In turn, Frankenheimer hired another television acquaintance, the promising young actor Sydney Pollack, as a dialogue coach for the teenage hoodlums who needed an authentic New York City accents. The Young Savages was partly filmed on location in New York City with three-time Academy Award nominated cinematographer Lionel Lindon. Lindon had won an Oscar in 1957 for his work on Around the World in Eighty Days. The cast featured Shelley Winters, who had just won an Oscar for The Diary of Anne Frank, Edward Andrews, who had just made Elmer Gantry with Lancaster and Dina Merrill, who had just finished Blake Edwards' Operation Petticoat with Cary Grant and Tony Curtis. Telly Savalas made his film debut playing the role of a tough cop, not unlike his future TV character in Kojak. The Young Savages was released in the spring of 1961 through United Artists, but unfortunately was not the success that Hecht had anticipated. Immediately after filming wrapped on The Young Savages, Hecht and Lancaster started filming their next project. Birdman of Alcatraz was once again financed by United Artists, as part of the recoup deal. The biopic was a romanticized depiction of Robert Stroud, a life-sentenced murderer who taught himself ornithology while confined in prison, and who became an authority on bird medicine. Stroud authored a series of books on the subject and gained enough recognition that a biography of his life was accounted by Thomas E. Gaddis. Gaddis' novel was first optioned by Twentieth Century-Fox in the late 1950s but the project was strongly opposed by the prison system which did not want to dignify the public's perception of the criminal. In 1960 Hecht and Lancaster purchased the film rights and hired Guy Trosper, an Academy Award nominee, to write the screenplay. Filming began on location in San Francisco in the summer of 1960, with British director Charles Crichton. But due to disagreements with Lancaster, Crichton was fired after a mere week of shooting. Hecht and Lancaster approached Frankenheimer to take over as director. No fewer that four film editors were hired and then fired. The rough cut ran four hours. Finally, when shooting wrapped, Lancaster personally supervised the editing. The result was an acclaimed and Academy-nominated performance for his acting. Two top cinematographers were hired to work on Birdman of Alcatraz; Burnett Guffey, who had won an Oscar in 1954 for his work on From Here to Eternity and had been nominated in 1957 for The Harder They Fall, and John Alton, who had worked with Lancaster on Elmer Gantry but was most known for the iconic film noir, The Big Combo. With Lancaster in the lead, the rest of the cast featured Karl Malden, a two-time Oscar nominee, once for A Streetcar Named Desire, another for On the Waterfront, Thelma Ritter, a five-time Oscar nominee, Telly Savalas, Neville Brand, Edmond O'Brien, an Oscar winner for The Barefoot Contessa who had appeared in Lancaster's first film, The Killers in 1946, Hugh Marlowe, who had appeared in Elmer Gantry and Whit Bissell, who had appeared in two other Lancaster films, Brute Force and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral as well as in Frankenheimer's The Young Stranger. The film also features an uncredited bit part by Len Lesser, who in the 1990s gained fame as Uncle Leo in Seinfeld. Elmer Bernstein returned to compose the soundtrack, his second collaboration with Hecht after his triumph on Sweet Smell of Success. Birdman of Alcatraz was another major success at film festivals and award ceremonies. After its release in the summer of 1962, it was nominated for four Oscars including one for Lancaster as Best Actor in a Leading Role, one for Telly Savalas as Best Actor in a Supporting Role, one for Thelma Ritter as Best Actress in a Supporting Role and one for Burnett Guffey for Best Black-and-White Cinematography. It won three Laurel Awards, one for Top Drama, one for Top Male Dramatic Performance and one for Top Female Supporting Performance. The British Academy Film Awards gave Lancaster an award for Best Foreign Actor and the Golden Globe Awards nominated him for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Savalas for Best Supporting Actor. The Directors Guild of America Award nominated Frankenheimer for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures and the Writers Guild of America Award nominated Trosper for Best Written American Drama. At the Venice Film Festival, it was nominated for its top prize, the Golden Lion, and won the Volpi Cup Award for Best Actor and the San Giorgio Prize Award. It also made the National Board of Review Awards' Top Ten Films list and was ranked number 76 on AFI's list, 100 Years‚Ä¶100 Cheers: America's Most Inspiring Movies. =Return to Harold Hecht Productions= Hecht's next project was originally planned for Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions in the late 1950s, after they bought the property from Robert Aldrich. But in early 1960 it was announced that Hecht was taking over the production of Taras Bulba, an action- adventure film that incorporated elements of war and romance.\\"UA Blockbuster's Pace at 2 a Month in 1960\\", Boxoffice February 1, 1960, p5 Based on Nikolai Gogol's novella of the same name, Taras Bulba tells the story of a Cossack clan in Ukraine fighting against the Poles, all while a love story develops between the son of the Cossack leader and the daughter of an aristocratic Polish family. The film was a co-production between Tony Curtis' Curtleigh Productions and Hecht's original Harold Hecht Productions, making a comeback after its first use for 1948's Kiss the Blood Off My Hands. Hecht hired J. Lee Thompson as director and Waldo Salt, who had written the script of The Flame and the Arrow in 1949 before being blacklisted, and Karl Tunberg, a two-time Oscar nominee who had just worked on megahit Ben-Hur, to write the screenplay. The title role was first planned for Lancaster, then for Anthony Quinn and finally landed on Yul Brynner, an Academy Award winner for his role in The King and I, who would provide an authentic performance with his Gypsy background. It co-starred Tony Curtis and Christine Kaufmann, who went on to marry him after the film. Featured roles were played by Sam Wanamaker, Brad Dexter, who had appeared in Hecht's Run Silent, Run Deep and The Magnificent Seven with Brynner, Guy Rolfe, Perry Lopez and George Macready. Hecht also gave a cameo role to his soon-to-be second wife, Martine Millner, as a gypsy dancer. The production was financed by United Artists with a budget of $3,800,000. Hecht went on location in Salta, Argentina with Eastmancolor equipped Panavision cameras, and two-time Oscar nominated cinematographer, Joseph MacDonald. After a series of delays, extensive hiring of extras for the battle scenes and post-production costs at Columbia Studios, the films' budget skyrocketed to a total of $7,000,000. Taras Bulba was released in late 1962 and featured a score by Franz Waxman, who had worked with Hecht on Run Silent, Run Deep. Waxman's soundtrack was a considerable success, surpassing the fame of the film itself. It was praised by Bernard Herrmann, considered by many to be one of Hollywood's greatest composers. Waxman's score was nominated for three awards; one at the Academy Awards for Best Music Score ‚Äì Substantially Original, another at the Golden Globe Awards, for Best Original Score and a last at the International Film Music Critics Association for Best Archival Re- Recording of an Existing Score. In late 1962 Hecht resumed work on Flight from Ashiya. By then Alan Pakula had dropped out to produce the drama film To Kill a Mockingbird. Waldo Salt continued his association with Hecht and co-wrote the screenplay with author Elliot Arnold. Oscar nominated director Michael Anderson (nominated for Around the World in Eighty Days) came on board with two cinematographers; Burnett Guffey, who had just been nominated at the Academy Awards for his work on Birdman of Alcatraz, and Joseph MacDonald, who had worked on Taras Bulba. The production was financed and distributed by United Artists on a much smaller budget of $1,800,000, but was still granted top-quality equipment of the era, including Panavision and Eastmancolor. The story revolved around a United States Air Force Air Rescue Service mission to save Japanese civilians stranded on a lifeboat. This time the crew traveled to Rome, Italy, where Hecht and his new bride Martine Millner were to have a limited honeymoon squeezed between the shooting schedule. Most of the filming subsequently took place in Japan, in Kyoto, Tokyo, Tachikawa and Osaka. The film starred Yul Brynner, Richard Widmark and George Chakiris, who was reluctant to take the role after winning an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in West Side Story. It also featured Suzy Parker, Shirley Knight, who had been nominated for Best Supporting Actress the year prior for The Dark at the Top of the Stairs, Danielle Gaubert and Eiko Taki, whom Hecht signed to a non- exclusive, three-picture contract with Harold Hecht Productions (the other two films on her contract were never made). Flight from Ashiya was released in the spring of 1964 to limited success. Tony Curtis had been under contract to Universal Pictures since 1948 and his last film for the studio was up. Hecht teamed up with Curtis' new production company, Reynard Productions, to produce the romantic comedy, Wild and Wonderful (previously, Monsieur Cognac). Financed through a strictly budgeted, one-picture deal with Universal, Wild and Wonderful was Hecht's fourth and final collaboration with Curtis. It also starred Curtis' new wife, Christine Kaufmann, who signed a six-picture contract with Harold Hecht Productions; the other five films of her deal never materialized. Featured roles were played by Larry Storch, Marty Ingels, Marcel Dalio, Cliff Osmond, Fifi D'Orsay, Vito Scotti, Stanley Adams and Shelly Manne. Wild and Wonderful was based on Dorothy Crider's story, I Married a Dog. The comedic plot involves an alcoholic dog, named Monsieur Cognac, who one night escapes from his mansion in Paris to get a drink. He befriends a young musician (Curtis) and spends the night with him at locals taverns before sleeping it off at his apartment. Monsieur Cognac's owner, a rich and famous actress (Kaufmann), finds the two of them the next day and develops a love affair with Curtis, much to the opposition of her jealous dog and her controlling father. A number of screenwriters worked on Wild and Wonderful, including Philip Rapp, Richard Powell, Larry Markes, Michael Morris and Waldo Salt. Director Michael Anderson returned to work with Hecht for a second time after Flight from Ashiya, with seven-time Academy Award nominated cinematographer, Joseph LaShelle, who had won an Oscar for Laura in 1945. The film was entirely set in Paris but because of Universal's limited budget, it became one of the few movies that Hecht was not granted permission to film on actual location. It was shot at Universal Studios with sets superbly designed by Ruby R. Levitt, an Oscar-nominated set decorator who had previously worked with Hecht on Kiss the Blood Off My Hands (also filmed at Universal Studios, in 1948). Wild and Wonderful was released in the spring of 1964 but was a box- office disappointment. In late 1962 Hecht signed a two-picture deal with Columbia Pictures.\\"A Hecht-Columbia Deal\\", Boxoffice, November 12, 1962, pW1 After a series of projects fell through, Hecht decided to revive an old Hecht- Lancaster Productions property from the mid-1950s, Roy Chanselor's Western novel, The Ballad of Cat Ballou. As a Hecht-Lancaster Productions project, Cat Ballou was originally to be a comedy musical Western film starring Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis as rival brothers. As early as 1960, Hecht worked on Cat Ballou as a solo project and was finally able to secure its production through his Columbia deal. The plot for Cat Ballou evolves around a young woman coming back to her homestead only to find her father's farm terrorized by local gunmen. She hires the legendary Kid Shelleen to defend the farm but soon realizes that he's a washout, more interested in getting drunk. The film went through a series of screenwriters from its inception in 1956, starting with Roy Chanselor who adapted his own novel, then William Bowers, William Ludwig, Burt Kennedy, Walter Newman, Mitchell Lindemann, Frank Pierson, and finally Walter Bernstein, who agreed to write the script \\"to Hecht's satisfaction\\". That no time limit clause in his contract caused him to work for two years until Hecht said, okay, that's it. Bernstein said he would never agree to such a contract clause again. The principal role of Kid Shelleen was offered and passed on by almost every big name star in Hollywood over its ten- year pre-production stage. After Lancaster dropped out, five other actors turned down the role, including Spencer Tracy, Kirk Douglas and Jos√© Ferrer, before Lee Marvin was offered the part. The role of Cat Ballou was also offered to a number of stars, including Natalie Wood (when Lancaster was still in the cast) and Ann-Margret (who didn't get a chance to accept it as her agent turned it down without consulting her), before Jane Fonda accepted it. The rest of the cast featured Michael Callan, Dwayne Hickman, Nat King Cole, Stubby Kaye, Tom Nardini, Jay C. Flippen, John Marley, Arthur Hunnicutt, Reginald Denny and Bruce Cabot. Cat Ballou turned out to be Nat King Cole's final film appearance as he passed away of lung cancer four months before it was released. The film was directed by Elliot Silverstein, who had spent the previous ten years directing television episodes, and was shot in twenty-eight days on location in Ca√±on City, Colorado, at the Columbia Ranch in Burbank, California and at the Gower Street Studios in Hollywood. Two-time Oscar nominee Frank De Vol composed the soundtrack with songs written by Mack David and Jerry Livingston. Released in the summer of 1965, Cat Ballou was a huge success and earned over $20,000,000 at the box-office. It was one of the top- ten films of the year and was nominated and won a ton of awards. At the 38th Academy Awards ceremony in 1966 it was nominated for five Oscars including one for Lee Marvin who won for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Other nominated categories included Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, Best Editing, Best Music, Original Song and Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment. At the Golden Globe Awards, Marvin won for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy, Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, Most Promising Newcomer ‚Äì Male and for Best Original Song. The British Academy Film Awards too rewarded Marvin for Best Foreign Actor and nominated Nardini for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles. The Laurel Awards was another big supporter of the film, with four Golden Laurels; one for Best Comedy, one for Top Male Comedy Performance, one for Top Female Comedy Performance and another for Top Song. The Directors Guild of America nominated Silverstein for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures and the Writers Guild of America nominated Newman and Pierson for Best Written American Comedy. The New York Film Critics Circle gave Marvin an award for Best Actor. The Berlin International Film Festival Awarded the film in three categories; the Silver Berlin Bear Award for Best Actor, the Award of Special Mention and the Award for Best Feature Film Suitable for Young People and nominated Silverstein for a Golden Berlin Bear Award for Best Director. Before Cat Ballou was even released, Hecht announced to the press an interest in producing a sequel entitled Kid Shelleen.\\"Hecht to Build Sequel Around Drunken Gunslinger Introduced in Cat Ballou\\", Valley News, August 17, 1965, p16 He hoped to have Marvin and Fonda reprise their roles and was in negotiation with Bette Davis for a part. Hecht worked on various scripts and pre-production stages over the next twenty years of his life. Cat Ballou was also adapted for two separate television pilots, both in 1971. The first was for ABC and starred Lesley Ann Warren as Cat Ballou, Jack Elam as Kid Shelleen and Tom Nardini who returned as Jackson Two Bears. The ABC episode aired on September 5, 1971. The second pilot was produced at the same time by NBC and starred Jo Ann Harris as Cat Ballou, Forrest Tucker as Kid Shelleen and featured Harry Morgan as a rancher. This episode aired on September 6, 1971, the day after the ABC episode was shown. Neither pilots were picked up for production. Hecht's final released film was adapted from A. B. Guthrie Jr.'s Pulitzer Prize-winning Western novel, The Way West. The production of The Way West marked the end of Hecht's contract with United Artists, which had already spent quite a considerable amount of money on pre-production at that point. The property had originally been purchased by Hecht-Lancaster Productions in late 1953 and Hecht spent fourteen years developing the screenplay under the financial supervision of United Artists. When announced in 1953, United Artists had granted the production unit the largest budget a Western film had ever received, with $5,000,000, advertising costs excluded.\\"UA to Place Emphasis on Top-Budget Films\\", Boxoffice, October 15, 1955, p14 By 1959 that budget had been raised to $8,000,000.The Pittsburgh Press, March 25 1959, p13 The Way West was intended as a major box-office attraction and Hecht hired Hollywood's top names to work on the film. Over the years such stars as Burt Lancaster, Gary Cooper, James Stewart, John Wayne, Charlton Heston, Ingrid Bergman and Katharine Hepburn were all signed on for parts. A number of writers also worked on various developments, including Clifford Odets, John Twist, Marvin Borowsky, James R. Webb and Jessamyn West. The final screenplay was written by Mitchell Lindemann and Ben Maddow and the production starred Kirk Douglas, Richard Widmark and Robert Mitchum. Jack Elam, Nick Cravat, John Mitchum (Robert Mitchum's younger brother, best remembered for appearing in Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry series), Stubby Kaye and Sally Field (making her film debut) all had featured roles. Filmed on location in Oregon and Arizona using Panavision cameras equipped with DeLuxe color film, The Way West retold the story of pioneers who crossed the Midwest to reach the new territory of Oregon in the mid-1840s. The film was directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, an established and well-respect Western director who had done McLintock! with John Wayne, Shenandoah and The Rare Breed, both with James Stewart, The Ballad of Josie with Doris Day and Peter Graves, and Gun the Man Down with James Arness. He had also directed a number of Western television episodes on Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel with Richard Boone, Gunsmoke with James Arness, Rawhide with Clint Eastwood and Gunslinger with Tony Young. The cinematographer on The Way West was equally qualified. William H. Clothier was a two-time Oscar nominee for Westerns. He had worked on Stagecoach, The Rare Breed, Shenandoah, Cheyenne Autumn, McLintock!, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Comancheros, The Alamo, The Horse Soldiers, Gun the Man Down and Seven Men from Now. The movie was topped by Bronislau Kaper's soundtrack, a three-time Academy Award nominated composer. But even with all the star-power that Hecht had employed over the years, the film turned out to be a box-office disappointment. After The Way West, Hecht continued working on a great many film projects and never retired from his profession. The next film he developed was The Comic, his second of the two-picture contract at Columbia Pictures. Adapted from the original story Baggy Pants by Walter Newman, The Comic was first adapted by the author in late 1965.\\"Columbia's 83-Film Production Slate\\" Boxoffice, January 3, 1966, p6] The story dealt with a silent screen star, his rise to fame and his downfall. In the summer of 1967 Hecht approached Dick Van Dyke to star in the film and Carl Reiner to direct and co-produce it.\\"Dick Van Dyke Gets Film Role\\", The Daily Intelligencer, June 10, 1967, p5 With them on board The Comic became a joint venture between Harold Hecht Productions, Van Dyke's DFI Productions and Reiner's Acre Enterprises. Later that summer Hecht screen-tested May 1967 Playboy Playmate of the Month model, Anne Randall, for the female lead.The Ottawa Journal, July 8 1967, p2 Reiner, Van Dyke and screenwriter Aaron Ruben re-wrote the screenplay considerably over the next year and by the summer of 1968, Hecht was out of the picture.\\"Dick Van Dyke, Level-Headed Square, Sees Things on Slant\\", Chicago Tribune, June 11, 1967 The film was eventually released in late 1969, strictly as a Reiner production, and it is currently unknown if any of Hecht's contributions remained in the final version of the film. One of the projects that has been wrongly accredited to Hecht is Ulzana's Raid. Certain sources claim (without validating their own sources) that Hecht (as well as Burt Lancaster, who starred in the film) was an uncredited producer.Ulzana's Raid, IMDB\\"In Search of Western Movie Sites\\", Carlo Gaberscek, Kenny Stier Hecht's involvement was never claimed by anyone who worked on the film and the only credited production companies and producers for Ulzana's Raid are Robert Aldrich and his production company, The Associates and Aldrich Company, and Carter DeHaven and his production company, De Haven Productions. There are no records of Hecht having any input on this film, nor of his various production companies being involved. Neither are there any records of Lancaster's company, Norlan Productions, being involved in the making of the film. Though Lancaster was often noted as having a strong influence on the directing and editing of the motion pictures he appeared in, Ulzana's Raid was in fact a financial agreement between Lancaster and Universal Pictures; in exchange for appearing in Ulzana's Raid, Universal was to finance the making of Norlan Production's film The Midnight Man. Hecht's collaboration on Ulzana's Raid is therefore a debated issue, and with no proof whatsoever to validate this claim, it is better to assume that he was not associated with the project at all. Personal lifeMarriage to Gloria Buzzell= Hecht was married twice. His first marriage was to Gloria Joyce Buzzell on November 1, 1947 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Gloria Buzzell's father, Samuel Jesse Buzzell, was a theatrical and music-patent attorney and her uncle was film director Edward Buzzell. She had previously worked as an executive assistant in MGM's story department.\\"Marriages\\", Variety, November 5, 1947, p56 Harold and Gloria had three children together; Steven, Duffy and Alma. Steven Hecht, born 1948 is an attorney living in the Los Angeles area. Duffy W. Hecht, born June 1950 at the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Hollywood, is a producer/writer living in Carpinteria, California. Alma Hecht, born September 1955 at the Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica is a landscape designer living in Berkeley, California. Harold and Gloria separated on July 18, 1959, with Harold moving permanently into Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions' luxurious apartment on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, which he had been maintaining during the couples previous arguments.\\"Divorce Granted\\" The Bee, June 29, 1961, p17] On August 25, 1960, Gloria sued Hecht for divorce alleging mental and physical suffering. Other causes stated included frequent arguments and Harold's extended absence from the family home while working on film productions.\\"People\\", The Pittsburgh Press, June 29, 1961, p2 Gloria demanded over $1,300,000 in community properties and full custody of their three children.\\"Producer Sued\\", The Southeast Missourian, August 26, 1960, p2 The filing for divorce procedure was granted by the Santa Monica, California court on September 7, 1960 and on June 28, 1961 the divorce was finalized. Harold's estimated $2‚Äì4 million value went under appraisal while the ruling over custody of their three children was postponed for an additional 60 days. Part of the estate included original Vincent van Gogh drawing The Plain of La Crau, purchased in 1955.Vincent van Gogh Auctions, 2013 Additional court sessions were held in July 1961, August 1962, April 1963 and June 1963, where Gloria sued for additional alimony. The court's decision concluded that Harold would pay alimony to Gloria for 121 months (a little over 10 years) regardless of occupation or remarriages.\\"Hecht v. Hecht\\", Justia US Law, January 18, 1968 If Harold was to pass away before the end of the ten years, his estate was to continue payments. In September 1962 Gloria remarried to Franklin Desser, an attorney, and became Gloria Hecht Desser. In January 1968, Harold filed for appeal over the alimony ruling but was denied. =Marriage to Martine Millner= Hecht's second marriage was to English model-actress Martine Millner, n√©e Margaret Truefitt. The couple took out a marriage license on Tuesday, October 30, 1962 in Los Angeles and were wed on Thursday, November 1 in San Francisco. They then embarked on a honeymoon in Rome, where part of Hecht's then production, Flight from Ashiya, was being filmed. At the time of their marriage, Millner was 26 while Hecht was 55. Millner had a cameo in Hecht's 1962 film, Taras Bulba. Harold and Martine also had three children together; Harold, Jr., Adam and Rebecca. Harold and Martine separated in September 1974, two months short of celebrating their twelve-year anniversary.Santa Cruz Sentinel, September 18 1974, p30 This time the court ordered Harold to pay a $4,000 monthly allowance to Martine and she retained possession of the couple's $350,000 home and half of his $2,000,000 community property assets.\\"Ordered to Pay Support\\", Lebanon Daily News, November 20, 1974, p36 Harold Hecht, Jr., born September 14, 1963, worked with director John Frankenheimer and is now a three-time Emmy Award-winning sports television producer.\\"Harold Hecht\\", So Cal Jewish Sports Hall of Fame\\"Harold Hecht\\", Awards and Winners Adam Arthur Hecht was born on August 6, 1965 at the UCLA Medical Center and worked as a tennis coach before mysteriously vanishing on July 7, 1989 from Beverly Hills, California at age 23.\\"A Boy for the Hechts\\", Boxoffice, August 16, 1965 He has never been found, but the police do not suspect foul play and classify the case as a missing person.\\"Adam Hecht\\", Unsolved The story of Adam Hecht's disappearance was depicted on the American television series Unsolved Mysteries in 1990.

The set spans 128 tracks over eight CDs. It won two Grammy Awards in 2006, Best Historical Album and Best Album Notes.  Background  In 1938, noted musicologist and Morton biographer Alan Lomax conducted a series of interviews with Morton at the Library of Congress. Richard Cook and Brian Morton describe these recordings as Jelly Roll Morton's \\"virtual history of the birth pangs of jazz as it happened in the New Orleans of the turn of the century. His memory was unimpaired, although he chose to tell things as he preferred to remember them, perhaps; and his hands were still in complete command of the keyboard.\\" Excerpts from the sessions first appeared on a 1948 album. Riverside Records issued the recordings as LP records in 1955. Ron Wynn and Bruce Boyd Raeburn note that \\"though the albums came out posthumously, the interviews generated tremendous new interest in Morton's life and music.\\" During the 1990s, Rounder Records released a series of compact discs including the musical content, but not the dialogue, from the 1938 sessions. Both the Riverside and earlier Rounder releases were heavily expurgated, and as recently as 2008, when selections from the complete Rounder collection were featured in a BBC Radio 4 documentary on Morton, presenter Marybeth Hamilton noted that, even then, some of the recordings were still considered unsuitable for broadcast, due to the obscene nature of some of the lyrics and Morton's narration.BBC Radio 4 - The Dream Time of Jazz (originally broadcast 7 July 2008)  2005 release  In 2005, Rounder released the 1938 recordings in their entirety as part of an eight-disc box set. The first seven discs include Lomax's 1938 interviews, in which Morton describes his life and the early days of jazz, plays piano, and sings. The eighth disc includes 1949 recordings of Morton's contemporaries, reminiscing about Morton and providing musical demonstrations. The set was originally released in a piano-shaped box and included a copy of Mister Jelly Roll, Lomax's biography about Morton. The set also includes a PDF file including additional liner notes, complete transcriptions of the recorded dialogue and lyrics, additional unrecorded interviews and archival documents and photos. In 2007, Rounder released Jelly Roll Morton: The Library of Congress Recordings by Alan Lomax, a single disc consisting of selected highlights from the box set.  Reception  arwulf arwulf, writing for allmusic, described the recordings as having been \\"beautifully restored.\\" Harvey Pekar, writing for The Austin Chronicle, gave the set a five-star rating (of a possible five), noting that \\"[Morton's] oral history here is provocative, and his playing bears out some of the hard-to-believe statements that have been made by (and about) him.\\" Richard Cook and Brian Morton, writing for The Penguin Guide to Jazz, gave the set a four-star rating (of a possible four), describing it as \\"surely the most comprehensive coverage of the speech and music to date.‚Ä¶ It is a wonderfully illustrated lecture on Morton's music by the man who created it.

It was launched on 8 August 1914. The ship became famous when it was torpedoed early in World War I and became the center of a diplomatic incident which moved the United States closer to war with Germany. The ship survived the attack but was eventually sunk in 1942 by torpedo attack in World War II. World War I controversy The ship was torpedoed by the German U-boat commanded by Rosenberg-Gruszczynski on 1 May 1915, despite America being a neutral party in the war at that time. The ship left Port Arthur on 10 April carrying a cargo of gasoline in the ship's tanks and barrels of lubricating oil to Rouen, FranceNewspaper report including personal account of the first officer During the latter half of the voyage the ships radio operator had heard messages from a British cruiser which judging from the transmission strength had been keeping station with Gulflight. At a point west of the Bishop Rock lighthouse, Scilly Isles, at 11 a.m. on 1 May, Gulflight was challenged by two British patrol vessels, HMS Iago and HMS Filey, which queried her destination. The patrol ships had been searching for a submarine which had been sinking ships in the area over the last couple of days. The patrol vessels were not satisfied with Gulflight's papers and suspected her of refuelling the U-boat, so ordered the tanker to accompany them into port. The patrol ships took up station one on either side of Gulflight, Iago close on the starboard side and Filey further ahead on the port. While under escort, Gulflight's second officer, Paul Bowers, reported sighting a submarine ahead some 28 minutes before the ship was hit. He reported this to the captain who decided that the submarine must be British, as the escorts had not reacted to its presence. The submarine was visible for five minutes and then disappeared. Shortly before 1 p.m., a submarine surfaced ahead of the ships and ordered them to stop. Filey attempted to ram the submarine, which submerged but fired a torpedo at the tanker. Von Rosenberg reported that he had seen a tanker under escort by ships flying the white ensign and had seen no flag on the escorted ship. After firing the torpedo, he spotted a U.S. flag on the tanker, so broke off the attack. Fire Axe from the tanker Gulflight At 12:50 p.m., an explosion took place sending a column of water into the air alongside Gulflight's starboard bow. The ship immediately started to sink and shortly the forward deck was awash. The crew abandoned ship and were taken on board by the patrol ship Iago which turned towards St Mary's island. At about 2:30 a.m., Captain Gunter from the Gulflight was taken ill and died around 3:40 a.m. from a heart attack. The remainder of the crew arrived at St. Mary at 10 a.m. on 2 May. Gulflight did not sink but instead was towed to Crow Bay by patrol vessels. Ralph Smith, previously first officer, was now invited to inspect the ship, which was examined by divers and had a large hole in the starboard bow. Smith and the first engineer remained with Gulflight while the remainder of the crew were evacuated to Penzance. Of the 38 crew, there were three fatalities. The captain had suffered a heart attack and two crew members were reported lost when they jumped overboard after the torpedo hit. She was the first American ship to be torpedoed during World War I, although another ship, the Cushing, had been bombed shortly before, again by mistake because no American markings could be seen from what was then a somewhat novel air attack. The German government apologized for attacking Gulflight, but refused to change its strategy of unrestricted submarine warfare. A report by the British admiralty into the attack concluded that the German commander had behaved properly according to \\"Cruiser rules\\" defined in international law. A merchant ship under escort by military vessels forfeited any right to be warned before being attacked, so the patrol ships had made Gulflight a legitimate target by taking her under escort. As an American ship, the submarine would not have attacked had he seen her nationality, but apart from an ordinary flag Gulflight was not carrying any additional markings painted on the hull to make clear her nationality, which other ships were then doing. The report also suggested that the tanker being stopped and then slowed down by the accompanying patrol had made her an accessible target. The Admiralty report was not published at the time and official comment did not explain the circumstances. The three deaths were the only Americans killed as a result of attacks on American ships by German submarine until 16 March 1917, when diplomatic relations had irreparably broken down just before the declaration of war.Report of the second officer and second engineer printed in 'The Times' state that the two who did not survive were the wireless operator Mr Short and a Spanish seaman. American official reaction to the incident was determined by President Woodrow Wilson under the advice of U.S. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan and Counselor to the State Department Robert Lansing. Bryan favoured reconciliation with Germany and avoidance of war, but this policy was becoming increasingly unpopular and was opposed by his subordinate Lansing. Lansing submitted a memorandum proposing immediate and vigorous protest and coupled with the Cushing incident and the sinking of on 7 May, a British ship but carrying American passengers who drowned, president Wilson made a forceful response to Germany. In June, Bryan resigned and was replaced by Lansing. Despite his belligerent formal advice, Lansing's private papers suggest that he considered the rights and wrongs of the situation much more finely balanced and the logical outcome ought to have been impartial military trade sanctions against both belligerents. However, the U.S. economy was already heavily committed to producing military supplies for the British, while American support for one side or the other was likely to prove decisive in choosing the eventual victor. The chief officer and the chief engineer returned to Gulflight, which was towed into port in the Scilly Isles for assessment and to land some of her cargo. Gulflight then proceeded under her own power to Rouen to deliver the remaining cargo. She was then taken to Newcastle-upon-Tyne for repairs before returning to service.  Later career and sinking  In 1937, the vessel was sold to the Nantucket Chief SS Co Inc of Port Arthur, Texas and renamed the SS Nantucket Chief. In 1938, it was sold again, this time to Harris & Dixon Ltd, London and was renamed the SS Refast. On 26 January 1942, the Refast was torpedoed and sunk by the German south of St Johns, Newfoundland.

The Crowninshield‚ÄìBentley House (circa 1727‚Äì1730) is a Colonial house in the Georgian style, located at 126 Essex Street, Salem, Massachusetts in the Essex Institute Historic District. It is now owned by the Peabody Essex Museum and open for public tours from June to October. The house was originally built for sea captain John Crowninshield at a site on 106 Essex Street. It is a symmetrical five-bay structure, clapboarded, two stories tall, with three small dormers through the roof, and a central entry door. Compare it with the architecture of the Ropes Mansion and the Peirce-Nichols House, also in Salem, and also owned by the Peabody Essex Museum. Some believe it may have started as a \\"half house\\" on the east side, and been expanded in 1761 and again in 1794. The building was moved to its present location in 1959-1960, at which time it was restored. Four generations of Crowninshields lived in the house until 1832. Its main historical interest centers upon Reverend William Bentley, a boarder from 1791 to 1819. It has been suggested that this house may be the model for \\"the old Crowninshield house\\" mentioned in the H. P.

It was one of the favourite residences of Mithridates the Great, who built a palace there, and later of King Polemon I and his successors.Catholic Encyclopedia, 1907, s.v. Neocaesarea In 72 or 71 BC, the Battle of Cabira during the Third Mithridatic War took place at Cabira, and the city passed to the Romans. Niksar was called Diospolis, Sebaste, and Neokaisareia during the Roman period. Pompey made it a city and gave it the name of Diopolis, while Pythodoris, widow of Polemon, made it her capital and called it Sebaste. It is not known precisely when it assumed the name of Neocaesarea, mentioned for the first time in Pliny, \\"Hist. Nat.\\", VI, III, 1, but judging from its coins, one might suppose that it was during the reign of Tiberius. In 344 the city was completely destroyed by an earthquakeJerome, Chronicle, anno 2362 Neocaesarea became part of the Eastern Roman Empire when the Roman Empire divided into two parts in AD 395. Another earthquake occurred in 499, the 499 Nicopolis earthquake.Theodorus Lector, II, 54 During the Middle Ages, the Muslims and Christians disputed the possession of Neocaesarea, and in 1068 a Seljuk general, Melik-Ghazi, whose tomb is still visible, captured and pillaged it. When the Seljuqs raided Anatolia in 1067, Neocaesarea was conquered by Af≈üƒ±n Bey, one of the commanders of Alp Arslan. The Byzantines retook the area in 1068. Conquered by Artuk Bey after the Battle of Manzikert, Neoc√¶sarea once again returned to Byzantium in 1073. Melik G√ºm√º≈ütekin Ahmet Gazi (better known as Danishmend Gazi), founder of the Danishmend, was the real conqueror of Neocaesarea. After the conquest the Gazi made it his capital city, and, under the name Niksar, became a center of science and culture. The Danishmend Gazi's mausoleum stands in a large cemetery just outside the town. By 1175, during the reign of Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Arslan II, Niksar was dependent on the Seljuks of Rum. After the Mongol invasion of the 13th century, Niksar was governed by the Eretnids and then the Beylik of Tacettin, a beylik and became the center of the latter principality. After Kadƒ± Burhanettin (who conquered Niksar in 1387) was killed in battle, the people of Niksar sought aid from the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I. The Sultan's son, S√ºleyman √áelebi, took Niksar for the Ottomans. In the later Ottoman period, Niksar became part of Tokat Province. Fatih Mehmet launched a raid on Trabzon from Niksar, and Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent raided the east from there. The town was predominantly Muslim in the mid 17th century. Ecclesiastical history Neocaesarea was an episcopal see in the late Roman province of Pontus Polemoniacus. At first called Cabira, it became the civil and religious metropolis of Pontus. In around 315, the Synod of Neo-Caesarea was held there. It is now one of the bishoprics listed in the Annuario Pontificio as titular sees and is referred to as Neocaesarea in Ponto to distinguish it from Neocaesarea in Syria.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 939 =Bishops= Seal of Constantine Melissopetriotes, Bishop of Neocaesarea Noted bishops include Saints Gregory Thaumaturgus, Paul of Neocaesarea, and Thomas, a 9th-century martyr. Gregory of Nyssa claimed that about 240, when Gregory Thaumaturgus was consecrated bishop of his native city, Neoc√¶sarea had only seventeen Christians and that at his death (270) it counted only seventeen pagans. In 315 a great council was held there, the acts of which are still extant. In the early church baptism was generally by immersion. Baptism by perfusion, that is by pouring the water over the candidate, was permitted in the case of the seriously ill and where sufficient water for immersion was unobtainable or impractical, as in, for example, prisons. The Council of Neocaesarea ruled that individuals baptized by perfusion were disqualified from being presbyters. This became an issue in the case of Novatian, who had received baptism by perfusion when dangerously ill.\\"Sacraments of the Orthodox Church\\", The Church Eclectic, 1901 Being early placed at the head of an ecclesiastical province, Neoc√¶sarea had four suffragan sees about 640 (\\"Ecthesis\\" of pseudo-Epiphanius, ed. Heinrich Gelzer, 539), retaining them until the tenth century, when Trebizond obtained its independence and, by degrees, the other three suffragans were suppressed. In 1391 the Archdiocese of Neocaesarea was confided to the metropolitan of Trebizond (Miklosich and M√ºller, \\"Acta\\", II, 154). About 1400 there was, however, a regular metropolitan (op. cit., II, 312), residing at Ordu. Among the twenty-seven bishops of this city mentioned by Le Quien, the most noted are Saints Gregory Thaumaturgus, Paul of Neocaesarea, and Thomas, a 9th- century martyr. Geographic location Niksar is approximately . It is located at 40¬∞35' north latitude and 36¬∞58' east longitude. Its average altitude is 350m above sea level. It is surrounded by Erbaa on the northwest, Tokat on the southwest, Almus on the south, Ba≈ü√ßiftlik on the southeast and Akku≈ü on the north. It is one of the five largest counties of Tokat. The Canik Mountains are to the north, D√∂nek Mountain to the south, and the Niksar Lowland is situated between these mountains. The Niksar Lowland is one of the most important lowlands of the Black Sea Region. The Canik Mountains are covered with plateaus that lie parallel to the Black Sea. √áami√ßi High Plateau is one of the most important ones. Niksar lands are irrigated by large and small tributaries of the Kelkit River. Forests cover 53% of the plateau, and pasture 12%; 32% of the land is devoted to agriculture, and only 3% is unsuitable for farming. Beech, pine, horn beech, and spruce trees can be found in the higher altitudes to the north of Niksar. In the lowlands there are poplar and willow trees, and fruit trees in the valleys. Polecats, rabbits, wolves, foxes, lynxes, bears, and pigs are the main hunting animals that live in the mountains and forests. Partridges, quail and ducks are among the more important game birds found here. Niksar has a transitional climate between the Middle Black Sea and Inner Anatolia. It is generally slightly warm and rainy in winter and hot in summer. The county averages an annual rainfall of 475.2 mm, and the annual average temperature is 14.7 ¬∞C. Cuisine of Niksar Historic house The most remarkable feature of traditional Tokat-Niksar houses is the kitchen. Called A≈üevi or A≈ügana in the local dialect, the kitchen is usually the largest room of the house and serves as a sort of lounge for the family. The typical kitchen has a fireplace on one side used for cooking or washing and a storeroom on the other in which dried foods, preserves, sauces, cheese and grape leaves are kept. Beside the storeroom is a wooden granary with partitions for storing cereals and legumes. In Turkey, it is common to eat meals around a low table. The famous local foods of Niksar are walnut, tomato paste and grape leaves which is a main ingredient of dolma, a very popular dish in Turkey.

The club got media attention after it authored a book, published in 1995, titled The Beardstown Ladies' Common-Sense Investment Guide: How We Beat the Stock Market - And How You Can Too, which claimed that the club produced annual returns of 23.4% since inception. The club authored additional books including The Beardstown Ladies' Stitch-In-Time Guide to GrowingYour Nest Egg: Step-by-Step Planning for a Comfortable Financial Future in January 1996 and The Beardstown Ladies' Pocketbook Guide to Picking Stocks in April 1998. The ladies gained speaking tours and became minor celebrities. In March 1998, Shane Tritsch published an article in Chicago titled Bull Marketing: Debunking the myth of the Beardstown Ladies and their spectacular stock market gains. The article noted that the club included a disclaimer in its books that the published returns included fees that were charged to members. After an audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the club noted that it had made a computer formula error in calculating its returns and its actual annual returns were 9.1%, which were below those of the S&P; 500 Index during the same time period. The club issued an apology and a disclaimer on all of its books, but by that time, it had sold over 1.1 million books. This revelation led to a class action lawsuit against publisher Hyperion, a division of The Walt Disney Company, which settled the case by offering to swap the Beardstown Ladies books for other Hyperion books. The experience provided a lesson to many on the importance of vetting investment claims. In 2010, a member of the club stated that only 4 or 5 of the original members remained in the club; the rest had died. In 2016 the club was still active, with over $400,000 invested and 75% of the members being descendents of the original club members.https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/08/beardstown-ladies-talk-trump-and-the- markets.html References Category:1983 establishments in Illinois Category:American finance and investment writers Category:American investors Category:Financial scandals Category:Investment clubs Category:Organizations established in 1983 Category:People from Beardstown, Illinois ","title":"Beardstown Ladies"},{"id":"2760449","text":"Yatong is a Tibetan pop singer from Kham, the eastern province of traditional Tibet.

Bolger, produced by John H. Williams, and written by Rob Moreland. It is based on the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen. The title is the opposite of a stock phrase, happily ever after; the name is contracted with an apostrophe between the N and the E. The film stars the voices of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Andy Dick, Wallace Shawn, Patrick Warburton, Sigourney Weaver, and George Carlin in his final film appearance. The film premiered on December 16, 2006, was theatrically released on January 5, 2007, by Lionsgate, and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 1, 2007, by Roadshow Entertainment. The film was panned by critics and audiences and was a box office disappointment, grossing $38 million worldwide on a production budget of $47 million. A direct-to-video sequel, Happily N'Ever After 2: Snow White Another Bite @ the Apple, was released on March 24, 2009. Plot The story begins with the idea that the Wizard controls all of the fairy tales and maintains the balance of good and evil in Fairy Tale Land. With the help of his assistants, the uptight Munk and the goofy Mambo, the Wizard is checking to make sure that all the fairy tales under his care are \\"on track\\" to have their traditional happy endings. As we meet him however, the Wizard is leaving for Scotland for a long-overdue vacation. He leaves the kingdom in the hands of Munk and Mambo. Ella is a girl who is better known as Cinderella. She lives as a servant to her stepfamily and often dreams of the Prince who will sweep her off her feet. Her best friend at the palace is Rick, the palace dishwasher. Rick takes it upon himself to deliver the invitations to the royal ball to Ella. Ella sees Rick only as a friend, but Rick secretly loves Ella, although he is too cool and proud to admit it. Rick can't really understand what Ella likes about the Prince. Rick's Three Amigos, the comic chefs in the palace kitchen, believe that Rick has a bad case of \\"Prince envy\\". The Prince does everything by the book, and plans to meet his maiden at the ball. However, things don't go as planned at the ball. Thanks to the assistants, Ella's evil stepmother, Frieda gains access to the Wizard's lair during the Prince's ball. She manages to chase off Munk and Mambo and tip the scales of good and evil, causing a series of fairy tales to go wrong and have unhappy endings, including Jack getting stepped on by the Giant yet surviving, Rumpelstiltskin winning his bet with the miller's daughter and taking her baby, and the unseen demise of Little Red Riding Hood. She summons an army of trolls, witches, three Big Bad Wolves, and Rumpelstiltskin to her castle. Ella finds out and escapes to the woods where she meets Munk and Mambo. The trio set out to find the prince who has goes looking for his maiden (not knowing it was actually Ella) in hopes that he will defeat Frieda and save the day. Together, they flee to the Seven Dwarfs' home. Witches and trolls led by The Ice Queen attack them. The Seven Dwarfs hold off the trolls, while they flee with the help of Rick who had stolen a flying broom. Frieda decides to go after Ella herself. She succeeds in capturing her and returns to the palace, with Rick, Munk and Mambo in pursuit. Frieda tortures Ella because if the story had run its course she would have married the prince while Frieda would never get anywhere in life. Rick, Munk, and Mambo slip into the castle and attack Frieda. During the fight, Frieda generates a pit in the floor. Mambo knocks her in, but she uses her staff to fly back up again. After a short battle, in which Rick takes a blast meant for Ella and falls into a deep sleep, Frieda creates a portal by accident. Ella knocks Frieda back and punches her into the portal. Rick awakes from the spell and he and Ella kiss, finally admitting their feelings for each other. Ella and her true love Rick decide to choose their destinies in a world of happy endings and get married. Rumpelstiltskin has shown that he has come to care for the baby and the miller's daughter lets him stay in the castle as the baby's nanny. The Wizard returns from vacation where he wasn't told about what happened while he was away. In the final scene, Frieda is shown trapped in the Arctic surrounded by elephant seals.

The commission has the statutory power to refer cases dealt with on indictment (ie solemn procedure cases) to the High Court of Justiciary. This was extended to include summary cases by Statutory Instrument on 31 March 1999, immediately before the Commission took up its role in April 1999. Though funded by the Scottish Government, investigations are carried out independently of Scottish Ministers, with the Commission being accountable to the Scottish Parliament on matters of finance and administration. Governance and administration The commission is headed by chief executive, Gerard Sinclair, and staffed by a director of corporate services, two senior legal officers, six legal officers and three adminastrative support staff. Eight legal officers and one senior legal officer are required to deal with the commission's normal case load. In order to review the case of Abdelbaset al- Megrahi, the commission sought approval from the Scottish Executive Justice Department for the appointment of two additional legal officers and one senior legal officer. The SCCRC has a board of management of eight members appointed by Her Majesty The Queen on the recommendation of the First Minister of Scotland. As of 28 July 2018, its current members are: *Mr Bill Matthews ‚Äì Chairman *Miss Frances McMenamin QC *Mr Peter Ferguson QC *Prof Jim Fraser *Dr Rajan Darjee *Mr Colin Dunipace *Mrs Elaine Noad *Mr Raymond McMenamin By statute, at least one third of the commission's members are required to be legally qualified (either an advocate or solicitor of at least 10 years' standing) and at least two-thirds must have knowledge or experience of the criminal justice system. The Board members and the Chief Executive are required to work together to ensure that the Commission runs efficiently and effectively. Remit and jurisdiction The commission's role is to review and investigate cases where it is alleged that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred in relation to conviction, sentence or both. The commission can only review and investigate cases where the conviction and sentence were imposed by a Scottish Court (the High Court, a Sheriff Court or a Justice of the Peace Court), and when the appeal process has been exhausted. =Powers= The SCCRC can investigate both solemn and summary cases. It will conduct a thorough, independent and impartial review and investigation of all cases accepted for review. The commission has wide-ranging powers of investigation. After the review has been completed the commission will decide whether or not the case should be referred to the High Court. If it is decided to refer a case, the case will be heard and determined by the High Court of Justiciary as if it were a normal appeal. Aims The main aims of the commission are: *To ensure that all cases are dealt with efficiently and effectively; *To deliver its services in ways appropriate to stakeholders' needs; *To promote public understanding of the commission's role; *To enhance public confidence in the ability of the criminal justice system to cure miscarriages of justice. Confidentiality and disclosure The commission operates under strict statutory non-disclosure provisions, and cannot disclose any information about individual cases. The commission can disclose the fact that a case has been referred to the High Court but will not release any information regarding cases in which no referral has been made or in respect of cases under review. Statistics As at 31 March 2007 the SCCRC had received a total of 887 cases since April 1999, when it was established. The Commission completed its review of 841 of these cases and referred 67 of them to the High Court. Of the referrals, 39 have been determined: 25 appeals were granted; 11 appeals rejected; and, 3 abandoned. Chief Executive, Gerard Sinclair, says that normally the court rules about half the referrals to be a miscarriage of justice each year, which would equate in 2003 to roughly 0.005% of the total number of Scottish criminal convictions. But, says Sinclair: \\"Even if it were just one wrongful conviction a year, that would still be one too many.\\" Budget and expenditure The Scottish Government agreed an SCCRC budget of ¬£1.2m for 2008‚Äì09. Lockerbie bombing Megrahi's 2003 application = Former SCCRC member, William Taylor QC, who acted as Senior Counsel for Megrahi at the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and at his appeal in 2002, resigned as a Commissioner on 23 September 2003. This was the same day as the SCCRC received an application from solicitors acting on Megrahi's behalf, requesting that it review his conviction. Megrahi's appeal against his 27-year minimum jail sentence was scheduled to be heard in Edinburgh before a panel of five Judges on 11 July 2006. This July hearing was, however, postponed to allow the question of the venue for the appeal (Edinburgh or Camp Zeist, Netherlands) to be resolved. On 1 November 2006 Megrahi was reported to have dropped his demand for the appeal against sentence ‚Äì and any further appeal against conviction that the SCCRC might award ‚Äì to be held at Camp Zeist. = SCCRC's decision = In January 2007, the SCCRC announced that it would issue its decision on Megrahi's case by the end of June 2007. On 17 June 2007 The Observer confirmed that the SCCRC's decision was imminent and reported: :\\"Abdelbaset al-Megrahi never wavered in his denial of causing the Lockerbie disaster: now Scottish legal experts say they believe him.\\" On 28 June 2007 the SCCRC announced its decision to refer the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal for Megrahi's second appeal against conviction, having concluded: :\\"that there is no reasonable basis in the trial court's judgment for its conclusion that the purchase of the items [clothes that were found in the wreckage of the plane] from Mary's House [in Malta] took place on 7 December 1988.\\" It is anticipated that preparation for the appeal before a panel of three Judges in Edinburgh could take as long as a year. = International observer's view = Professor Hans K√∂chler, who was appointed by UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to observe the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial at Camp Zeist, Netherlands was reported to be baffled by the SCCRC's four-year delay in reaching a conclusion. K√∂chler said: :\\"In my experience as observer of the Lockerbie trial, the Roman law system is superior to the common law system (practised in Scotland), particularly in matters of criminal law. It is indeed revealing that it takes the SCCRC so many years (that are apparently needed, inter alia, for secret negotiations between the governments of the involved countries) to announce its decision on whether there should be a retrial in the Lockerbie case or not.\\" Following the SCCRC's decision on 28 June 2007 to refer the case back for a second appeal, K√∂chler expressed surprise at the focus of the commission's review and its apparent bias in favour of the judicial establishment: :\\"In giving exoneration to the police, prosecutors and forensic staff, I think they show their lack of independence. No officials to be blamed: simply a Maltese shopkeeper.\\" On 4 July 2007 K√∂chler wrote to Scottish First Minister, Alex Salmond, to Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, to Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, and to FCO Minister of State with responsibility for Africa, Asia and the UN, Mark Malloch Brown describing the SCCRC's decision as \\"long overdue\\" and calling for a full and independent public inquiry into the Lockerbie case. = Administration of the Lockerbie review = On page 16 of the 2007‚Äì2008 annual report and accounts of the SCCRC, published on 4 June 2008, chief executive Gerald Sinclair has written a summary of the SCCRC's administration of the Lockerbie review.

Originally, the group name referred to a specific mineral, but was redefined in 1978 to stand for a class of minerals of similar chemical makeup that comprise a solid solution series, and includes the members fluorapophyllite-(K), fluorapophyllite-(Na), hydroxyapophyllite-(K). The name apophyllite is derived from the Greek ·ºÄœÄŒøœÜœÖŒªŒªŒØŒ∂œâ apophylliso, meaning \\"it flakes off\\", a reference to this class's tendency to flake apart when heated, due to water loss. These minerals are typically found as secondary minerals in vesicles in basalt or other volcanic rocks. A recent change (2008) in the nomenclature system used for this group was approved by the International Mineralogical Association, removing the prefixes from the species names and using suffixes to designate the species.Burke, E.A.J. (2008): Tidying up mineral names: an IMA-CNMNC scheme for suffixes, hyphens and diacritical marks. Mineral. Rec., 39, 131‚Äì135. A subsequent nomenclature change approved by the International Mineralogical Association in 2013 renamed the minerals to include both suffixes and prefixes, as shown above. Though relatively unfamiliar to the general public, apophyllites are fairly prevalent around the world, with specimens coming from some of the world's most well-known mineral localities. These localities include: Jalgaon, India; the Harz Mountains of Germany, Mont Saint-Hilaire in Canada, and Kongsberg, Norway, with other locations in Scotland, Ireland, Brazil, Japan, and throughout the United States.

Located at 2501 East Telewa Trail, it sits atop a knoll with views of greater Phoenix to the south, close to the Arizona Biltmore Hotel, which Wrigley owned. History Architect Earl Heitschmidt of Los Angeles designed the home at a cost of $1.2 million, in a combination of styles including Spanish Colonial. It has 24 rooms, 12 bathrooms, and over . Much of the extensive tilework was shipped to Phoenix from Wrigley's own factory in Catalina, hauled by mule to the site. The Wrigleys maintained other residences in Chicago; Philadelphia; Lake Geneva, Wisconsin; Catalina Island; and Pasadena, and used this, the smallest of their houses, for only a few weeks a year. William Wrigley died in 1932, shortly after its completion. ;Wrigley Mansion Club In July 1992, Geordie Hormel bought the mansion and made it available for meetings, conventions and similar functions. Due to zoning regulation, The Wrigley Mansion must operate as a private club. Landmark designations The Wrigley Mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

According to a precedent from 2011, residents are entitled to refuse presenting the card, unless the state-official has a reason to suspect that they have committed an offence.Court: There is no Obligation to Present an Identity Card upon a Policeman's Request, by Revital Hovel, Haaretz, 5 Dec 2011 (in Hebrew). Law and common practice It is a criminal offence to not carry an identity card or to misuse the document and a person can be fined about ‚Ç™1,400 ). However, the law explicitly forbids pressing charges if the offender contacts the relevant authorities within five days and identifies himself properly. Furthermore, in December 2011, a Peace Court (Magistrate Court) in the Krayot region acquitted an Israeli citizen from Nahariya who refused to present his identity card to a policeman upon request. The judge ruled that the current interpretation of law must be in the spirit of the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty (enacted in 1992); such a refusal should be deemed legitimate unless the state-official has a reason to suspect that the person before him has committed an offence. In addition to the above law, the identity card is required in order to exercise certain civil rights. Until recently, it was the only valid identification for voting in general elections. However, since 2005, the law also permits the use of a valid driver's license or a valid Israeli passport.Amendment no. 54 to article no. 74 of the Election Law, approved by the Knesset on December 5, 2005. When not specifically required by law, other identification may be used. In Israel, access to many office buildings or guarded areas requires showing ID.For example, the Al-Aqsa mosque area in Jerusalem, Azrieli Towers in Tel Aviv, Aviv Towers in Ramat Gan and many others. Identity cards are issued by the Israeli Ministry of Interior through offices across the country. The document is issued to all residents over 16 years old who have legal permanent residence status, including non-citizens. Up until July 2012, the document had no expiry date, and it could be used as long as it was intact. All non- biometric identity cards will expire after 10 years or in July 2022, whichever date is earlier. Identity cards issued to temporary residents have the same duration as the visa that grants temporary residence to the person in question, usually one year. Document contents The card is credit card sized and includes the following personal details: *Identity Number (Mispar Zehut) *full name (surname/last name, given name) *name of father *name of mother *name of grandfather (father's father) *date of birth (both civil and, unless otherwise requested, Hebrew date as well) *status *gender *place and date of issue (both Gregorian and Hebrew dates) *portrait photo (in color) *current address *previous name(s) *status (citizen, permanent residency, temporary) *previously le'om (nationality) *name, birth date and identity number of spouse and children (if applicable) Question of ethnicity A non- biometric Israeli identity card issued until 2017 Booklet cover of a non- biometric Israeli identity card Prior to 2005, Identity Cards included a reference to the bearer's ethnic group. The official term for this category in Hebrew was le'om (◊ú◊ê◊ï◊ù), and it was officially translated into Arabic as qawmƒ´ya (ŸÇŸàŸÖŸäÿ©). These terms could be translated into English as \\"nation\\" but in the sense of ethnic affiliation rather than nationality. The le'om attribution was assigned by the Ministry of Interior regardless of the card bearer's preference. There were several attributions, the main ones being Jewish, Arab, Druze and Circassian. Identity Cards issued before 2005 included a disclaimer written in small print in Hebrew and Arabic indicating that the card may serve as a prima facie proof for the data that it includes except le'om, marital status and the spouse's name. There were fierce legal battles about identifying the ethnicity of the bearer in the Israeli Identity card. In the 2000s, the ethnicity indicator began to be officially phased out. In 2002, the Supreme Court of Israel instructed the Ministry of Interior to indicate the ethnicity of people who underwent a Reform conversion as Jews. The minister at the time, Eli Yishai, a member of Shas, a Haredi party, decided he would drop the ethnicity category altogether, rather than list as Jews people whom he considered non-Jews. In 2004, the Supreme Court denied a citizen's petition to reinstate this indicator, stating that the field in the document was meant for statistical collection only, not as a declarative statement of Judaism. As of 2005, the ethnicity has not been printed; a line of eight asterisks appears instead. The bearer's ethnic identity can nevertheless be inferred by other data: the Hebrew calendar's date of birth is often used for Jews, and each community has its own typical first and last names. As of 2015, the ethnicity has been completely removed (including the asterisks), and replaced by status - which defines whether a person is a citizen, permanent or temporary resident. An amendment to the Israeli registration law approved by the Knesset in 2007 determines that a Jew may ask to remove the Hebrew date from his entry and consequently from his Identity Card. That is due to errors that often occur in the registration of the Hebrew date because the Hebrew calendar day starts at sunset, not at midnight. The amendment also introduces an explicit definition for the term \\"a day according to the Hebrew calendar\\". ID card casing and variations The colour of the plastic casing for the non-biometric identity cards of Israeli citizens and permanent residents was blue, with the Israeli Coat of Arms embossed on the outer cover. The casing of cards belonging to temporary residents is the same as the one of citizens and permanent residents, while the card itself has a pink hue. Non-Israeli residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were issued ID cards by the Civil Administration of Judea and Samaria (and Gaza until 2005), which had an almost identical layout as the Israeli card (the differences being that the surname category came after the first name, father's name, and grandfather's name categories instead of at the top, and the \\"ethnicity\\" category was replaced with a \\"religion\\" category). The casings for those cards were orange (West Bank) or red (Gaza Strip) with the Israel Defense Forces insignia embossed on the outer cover. Palestinians barred from entering Israel were issued ID cards with green casings instead of orange to identify them as such. Since the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority, the PNA issues its residents with Palestinian ID cards based on Israeli approval. They are identical to the Israeli Civil Administration cards except for the order of languages being switched, Arabic coming before Hebrew, and the plastic casing being dark green with the PNA insignia embossed on the outer cover. Israel controls the Palestinian population registry per the Interim Agreements, and assigns the ID numbers for Palestinian ID cards. Israel began issuing ID cards to Palestinian residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip following their capture in the 1967 war. Other The Identity number comprises nine digits, the last of which is a check digit calculated using the Luhn algorithm.

It was widely used for many years in driving scenes, or to show other forms of \\"distant\\" background motion.  Technique  Rear projection effect The actors stand in front of a screen while a projector positioned behind the screen casts a reversed image of the background. This required a large space, as the projector had to be placed some distance from the back of the screen. Frequently the background image would appear faint and washed out compared to the foreground. The image that is projected can be still or moving, but is always called the plate. One might hear the command \\"Roll plate,\\" to instruct stage crew to begin projecting. These so-called process shots were widely used to film actors as if they were inside a moving vehicle, who were, in reality, in a vehicle mock-up on a soundstage. In these cases the motion of the backdrop film and foreground actors and props were often different due to the lack of steadicam-like imaging from the moving vehicles used to produce the plate. This was most noticeable as bumps and jarring motions of the background image that would not be duplicated by the actors. A major advance over rear projection is front projection, which uses a special screen material to allow the plate to be projected from the front of the screen. This results in a much sharper and more saturated image. Although the technique had been used experimentally for some time, it was during the filming of 2001: A Space Odyssey that the modern version was fully developed. In this case it was used to avoid costly on- location shots in Africa during the opening scenes of the movie, but the effect was also used throughout the film for a variety of shots into or out of the windows of spacecraft. 2001 also used rear projection to produce computer screen effects. As front projection and bluescreen effects became more widespread and less costly, rear projection has been rendered largely obsolete. Quentin Tarantino used the process for the taxi ride sequence of Pulp Fiction, and James Cameron used rear projection for several special effects shots within Aliens, including the crash of the dropship as well as for several important sequences in Terminator 2: Judgment Day such as the car escape from the mental hospital and the T-1000 hijacking the Police helicopter; he has been described as one of the few people in Hollywood still able to understand and use process photography as an effective technique.Terminator 2: Judgement Day Ultimate Edition DVD special features, interview with James Cameron on 'Process Photography' Also, the Austin Powers film series frequently used rear projection to help give it the feel of old spy movies; Natural Born Killers used the technique extensively throughout to emphasize characters' subconscious motivations.  History  Rear projection was conceived long before its actual usage; however, it was only made possible in the 1930s due to three necessary technical developments. The most important was the development of camera and projector motors which could be linked up for synchronization of their shutters, which were developed out of the unrelated needs of \\"talking\\" movies whose timing had to be carefully controlled. Secondly, Eastman Kodak's introduction of panchromatic film stock in 1928 allowed for the camera to expose the projected background more than orthochromatic stocks, making it look less faint than it did before. Finally, the larger film gauges beginning to emerge in the late 1920s demanded more powerful projection lamps, which were subsequently available for making the rear projection screen brighter and thus more properly exposed. Fox Film Corporation was the first to use the rear projection technique, in 1930 with their films Liliom and then Just Imagine, and were subsequently awarded a technical Oscar for their work the next year. Shortly after this debut, Farciot Edouart ASC, at Paramount Pictures, refined the technique starting in 1933, and developed several new methods, such as syncing three projectors with the same background plate for more even and bright exposure. Linwood Dunn ASC, at RKO Radio Pictures, expanded on this with the use of traveling matte with films like Flying Down to Rio (1933). The American made version of 'Saint Joan of Arc\\" was the first movie created with the advent of \\"The Hansard Process\\" one of the pioneers in Rear Screen Special Processing. The Tornado in the Wizard of Oz was created by \\"The Hansard Process\\" technology and company. In the late 1940s, David Rawnsley introduced the technique in four minor British films, when it was heavily criticised. Alfred Hitchcock used the process successfully to show Cary Grant being attacked by a crop duster plane in North by Northwest, but was criticized when he used it extensively in Marnie. Fantasy filmmaker Ray Harryhausen pioneered a variation of rear projection in the 1950s and 1960s with Dynamation, where the rearscreen was placed on a miniature set along with stop-motion creatures. Harryhausen figured out a way to synchronize the movement of the miniature figures with the background projection as a way to insert live-action humans in the same scene as the creatures.

Church Ope Cove is a small secluded beach on the sheltered eastern side of the Isle of Portland in Dorset, southern England and is part of the Jurassic Coast.Church Ope Cove, Dorset Beaches. It is found close to the village of Wakeham. The beach has many unusual features for the Isle of Portland. The beach used to be sandy, but quarry debris now covers the sand, and has been worn into rounded pebbles. The pebbles cover a small stream which runs to the sea, which is one of the few active streams remaining on the Isle of Portland. History Church Ope Cove In 789 AD, the first recorded Viking attack within British Isles, including Ireland, occurred on Portland's coast. It is believed that Church Ope Cove was the location.Official Church Ope Cove and East Weares information board at cove viewpoint area The exposed location was later defended by the Norman 12th-century Rufus Castle, built on the cliff-top overlooking the beach. The remaining castle seen today dates from the late 15th-century. The cove's area was also used for the building of Portland's first parish church, St Andrews Church, which was probably first established above the cove by the Saxons. Between 1797-1800, John Penn, Governor of Portland and grandson of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, had the Gothic revival mansion Pennsylvania Castle built on a platform above the cove. During the early 19th-century he had a bath built below the gardens of his castle, known as John Penn's Bath. However, when it was completed, the Court Leet demanded an annual rent for its use after it was built on Common Land. Penn refused to pay, and the bath was abandoned, with the remains still in existence today. Penn's servants would have been tasked with bringing water up from the cove to the bath. The four east-most beach huts on the beach at Church Ope Cove. Portland had a large history of smuggling, and Church Ope Cove was one of the famous smuggling beaches. Into the 20th-century, fishing was still an industry that used the beach for the launching of boats.http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/PortlandArchivePictures/html/fishing.html For decades, an old rusting hand winch has been left lying on the beach, and is a reminder of the fishing trade.http://www.geoffkirby.co.uk/Portland/695710/ As part of the anti- invasion measures during World War II, two pillboxes were constructed to look over Church Ope Cove. A minefield was also placed at the back of the cove. Beach The path leading down to the cove, next to Rufus Castle. The beach is one of the few beaches on Portland, and due to having cliffs on three sides, is often sheltered from prevailing wind. As the fishing industry declined, the cove became a favourite sheltered beach for swimming and today continues to be popular for fishing, snorkelling and swimming. The beach provides diving access to the numerous wrecks in the surrounding waters too, which has made it a popular area for diving too. Access To access the beach there are two paths. The main path follows the road past Portland Museum and leads under the arch bridge of Rufus Castle, then down concrete steps to the cove. These were laid out by the local council in 1906, at a time when the beach was becoming increasingly popular as a recreational area. The view point above the steps, looking down on the cove, is part of the coastal path. The other path runs through a small area of woodland around the outside of Pennsylvania Castle, and passes through the ruins of St Andrew's Church (close to John Penn's Bath), before linking up over midway down the concrete steps to the cove.

Widely regarded as the greatest Guyanese poet, and one of the most important poets of the Caribbean region, Carter is best known for his poems of protest, resistance and revolution. He played an active role in Guyanese politics, particularly in the years leading up Independence in 1966 and those immediately following. He was famously imprisoned by the British government in Guyana (then British Guiana) in October 1953 under allegations of \\"spreading dissension\\", and again in June 1954 for taking part in a PPP procession. Shortly after being released from prison the first time, he published his best-known poetry collection, Poems of Resistance from British Guiana (1954).  Life  Martin Carter was born in Georgetown in what was then British Guiana (now Guyana) to Victor Emmanuel and Violet Eugene Carter (n√©e Wylde) on 7 June 1927. He was one of seven siblings. From 1938 to 1947 he attended Queen's College school, in Georgetown. On leaving Queen's College, Carter decided not to go to university and, instead, joined the civil service where he worked for the Post Office and then for the Prison Service. The year 1948 saw the first publication of Carter's poetry, when a \\"fragment\\" of his poem \\"An Ode to Midnight\\" was printed in A. J. Seymour's literary journal Kyk- Over-Al. In 1950 Carter became one of the founding members of the socialist and anti-colonial People's Progressive Party (PPP), led by Cheddi Jagan. He published his second poem, \\"The Indian Woman\\", in the same year, in the PPP journal Thunder (under the pseudonym M. Black). Carter married Phyllis Howard in 1953, and their first child, Keith, was born later that year. In 1953, Carter left the civil service and stood for the PPP in the first universal suffrage elections in British Guiana. He was not elected, but the PPP won a convincing victory. In October 1953, following the British government's declaration of a State of Emergency in Guyana, he was arrested and detained without charge at a US airbase in Timehri on suspicion that he was \\"spreading dissension\\", along with Eusi Kwayana and Cheddi Jagan. While detained, Carter took part in a one-month hunger strike, beginning on 23 November, organised by the detainees as a protest against the injustices of the government and their being held, indefinitely, without charge. He remained in prison until January 1954, when he was released under orders not to leave Georgetown. The restriction orders placed upon him lasted until 1957. In May 1954, Poems of Resistance from British Guiana was published in London by the Marxist publishing house Lawrence and Wishart, making Carter one of the first Caribbean poets to be published outside of the Caribbean. In June 1954 he was arrested once again for taking part in a PPP procession, and was imprisoned for six months, until December that year. His second child, Sonia, was born shortly after his release. When disagreement in the PPP led to a split in the party and the founding of a rival party, the People's National Congress (PNC) (under Forbes Burnham) in 1955, Carter chose to remain with the PPP. This would not last long, however: just a year later, in 1956, he was expelled from the PPP for being an \\"ultra-leftist\\". After leaving the PPP, he worked briefly as an information officer in the British Council's Georgetown Office, and then for a longer period (1959‚Äì67) as an Information Officer for Booker (a multinational company and owner of Guyana's sugar estates). Following the declaration of Guyana's Independence in May 1966, he resigned from Booker and joined the PNC as Minister of Information and Culture in 1967. In 1966‚Äì67 he represented Guyana at the United Nations. Concerned about the way in which the PNC government was developing, he resigned from this position, and indeed from governmental politics, in November 1970, remarking that he wished to live \\"simply as a poet, remaining with the people\\". From 1970 to 1978, he returned to Booker once again, resigning for the last time in 1978 to become a lecturer in creative writing and artist in residence at the University of Guyana. During this time, he wrote Poems of Succession, which was published in 1977 by New Beacon Books. In 1978 he was badly beaten when he took part in a demonstration against the PNC and their refusal to hold elections. Politically, his sympathy lay with the Working People's Alliance of Eusi Kwayana and Walter Rodney during this time, although he never became a party member. In 1992 Carter took part in a Guyanese Writers Tour, in the UK, with Wilson Harris, Fred D'Aguiar and Grace Nichols. In 1993 Carter suffered a stroke and lost the ability to walk and talk. He died on 13 December 1997, survived by his wife and their four children. He was buried at the Place of Heroes in the Botanical Gardens in Georgetown, an honour that had previously been reserved for Heads of State.  Poetry and critical reception  His collection Poems of Resistance, published in 1954, established his reputation as a powerful moral and political voice. Long seen as primarily a poet who touched on themes of politics, resistance, and protest, his later poems were often highly personal. He is best known, however, for a powerful protest poem of the 1960s, \\"I come from the nigger yard of yesterday\\".Andrew Stone, \\"Inspiring Poetry ‚Äì Review of University of Hunger, Socialist Review. At the Live from Lincoln Center jazz concert for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, Danny Glover quoted some lines of Carter's, bringing him to public attention in North America for the first time in the twenty-first century.

His work is in the collections of numerous museums including the Seattle Art Museum, the Tacoma Art Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He has been called \\"Perhaps the most powerful artist to emerge from the Northwest School\\". Anderson's mature work often draws from a set of symbols (circle, spiral, egg, seed, wave) he developed from the study of religious, mythical, and philosophical sources. The symbols are frequently combined with the human figure. Beginning in 1960s he painted on brown roofing paper that came in long rolls and permitted him to paint on a grand scale. Anderson said: \\"I read the Vedanta and the Vedas and I think about the order of the universe. The more we send men out into space, the more I realize we already are in space, floating out there. The whole order is preordained, in some miraculous way. I think all creation is magical.\\" Early life Anderson grew up in a semi-rural setting north of Seattle, in the town of Edmonds, Washington, where he'd been born on November 20, 1906. Some of his early paintings portrayed his family home. A piano was an important presence in his house. His father, Irving Anderson, was a carpenter-builder and also a musician. From an early age Guy was intrigued by other cultures; he was particularly fascinated by the woodcarvings of Northern Coastal native tribes, and by the collection of Japanese prints owned by his piano teacher. As soon as he was old enough to do so on his own, he began commuting to the Seattle Public Library by bus to study art books.Ament, Deloris Tarzan; Iridescent Light: The Emergence of Northwest Art, University of Washington Press, 2002; In the Dark and Light of Seeding, Guy Anderson, 1970, oil on paper. Woodside/Braseth Gallery collection. After graduating from Edmonds High School, Anderson briefly studied with Alaskan scenic painter Eustace Ziegler, who encouraged Anderson's career-long preference for oil paints, and taught him how to draw nude figures, which would become important features of his work.Wehr, Wesley, The Eighth Lively Art: Conversations with Painters, Poets, Musicians, and the Wicked Witch of the West; University of Washington Press, 2000; In 1929, Anderson applied for and won a Tiffany Foundation scholarship and spent the summer studying at the Tiffany estate on Long Island, New York. As there were no art museums in Seattle at that time, he delighted in weekend visits to the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, examining the works of Rembrandt, Goya, Whistler, and many others. Career On his return to Washington in the fall of 1929, Anderson set up a studio in an outbuilding on his parents' property, and had paintings included in a group show at the Fifth Avenue Gallery in downtown Seattle. The show piqued the interest of 19-year- old painter Morris Graves, who lived near Anderson, and the two became lifelong friends. In 1934 they traveled together to California in a beat-up panel truck, attempting to sell their paintings along the way. They also spent time painting near Monte Cristo in the North Cascade mountains. 'Search' by Guy Irving Anderson, 1968, 40 x 65, Cassera Gallery Inventory #GA023 With the opening of the Seattle Art Museum in 1933, Anderson befriended its founder, Dr. Richard Eugene Fuller, and worked there for several years, off-and-on, as an installer and children's art teacher. His lifelong interest in Asian art and culture was deepened by both close exposure to the museum's major collection of Asian art and artefacts, and by socializing and sometimes painting with members of Seattle's vibrant Asian arts community.Hallmark, Kara Kelley; Encyclopedia of Asian American Artists: Artists of the American Mosaic. Greenwood, 2007; In the Northwest Annual Exhibition of 1935 he won the Katherine Baker Purchase Award, and the museum mounted a solo exhibition of his work the following year. In 1937, Anderson helped refurbish a burned- out house Morris Graves had discovered near the small town of La Conner, Washington, in the Skagit Valley, about sixty miles north of Seattle. The two decorated the earthen-floored studio with furniture made of driftwood and raw cedar logs. Like many artists during the Great Depression, Anderson worked for the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project. Hired by the program's Washington director, R. Bruce Inverarity, he taught at the Spokane Art Center in 1939-40, alongside painters Carl Morris and Clyfford Still, sculptor Hilda Deutsch, and muralist Ruth Egri. The center was widely praised as being among the most popular and productive of the more than 100 community art centers opened nationwide by the FAP.Mahoney, Eleanor, The Spokane Arts Center: Bringing Art to the People; Pacific Northwest Labor & Civil Rights/University of Washington website; retvd 6 24 14; http://depts.washington.edu/depress/spokane_art_center.shtml Throughout the 1940s and 50s Anderson was very much involved in Seattle's bustling art community. Morris Graves and Mark Tobey had become artists of international reputation; Tobey's studio and the home of painters Margaret and Kenneth Callahan become centers of lively socializing and philosophical debate. Otto Seligman and Zoe Dusanne were championing abstract art at their respective galleries, while SAM, the Henry Art Gallery, and the Frye Art Museum cautiously supported it. Anderson taught at the Helen Bush School in Seattle and Ruth Pennington's Fidalgo Art School in La Conner, while working at SAM, building stone mosaic patios for well-to-do patrons, and producing driftwood art for the commercial market. He lived in Seattle's University District, but spent much of his time painting at Graves' studio in La Conner or at the Callahans' summer place in Granite Falls, Washington. After a very successful show at SAM in 1945, he purchased his own cabin in Granite Falls. In September 1953 he became nationally known when Life magazine ran a major feature presenting Anderson, Tobey, Graves, and Kenneth Callahan as the \\"big four\\" of Northwest mystic art. In 1959 Anderson left Seattle for good. He rented a house on the edge of La Conner, where he found inspiration from the vast skies and natural settings of the surrounding area. He gathered rocks and driftwood, which he composed around his rustic home in various assemblages. For a time, he rented a studio on the main street of La Conner. Later, he bought property at 415 Caledonia Street, building a house and studio there. He began painting large works on roofing paper purchased from a local lumber company. Working with large sheets of paper on the floor in the studio above his living room, Anderson used thinned oil paint and large brushes. The scale of the format enabled his brushstrokes to become expansive and expressive, while its texture gave unexpected complexities which he valued. Over the years his art ranged from densely worked and tightly composed figurative images of Northwest landscapes to large, sweeping brushstrokes with flowing, symbolic and iconographic forms. Anderson always preferred a limited palette of mostly muted earthy tones, sometimes accented with brilliant red. The male nude‚Äîoften placed horizontally‚Äîfigures prominently in many of his paintings. His works are often inspired by, and titled after, Greek mythology and Native American iconography. In 1966 Anderson traveled to Europe for the first time with friends and fellow artists Clayton and Barbara James. In 1975 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which, among other things, allowed him to visit major museums in Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C., and travel extensively in Mexico. In 1982 he visited Osaka, Japan for an exhibition featuring his work. He received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Seattle Center in 1995, and many who knew him personally considered him a \\"living treasure.\\" Anderson was a complex, affable, and generous man with a wide-ranging mind and a devious sense of humor. His paintings can be read in many ways, but he cherished the premise of the human figure‚Äîa prominent feature in many of his works‚Äîas being symbolic of the journey of life. Final years Guy Anderson never quite achieved the international stature of his friends Tobey and Graves. This was partly due to bad luck - such as a newspaper strike leaving his first solo exhibition in New York (at the Smolin Gallery in 1962) unreviewed - but he turned down other important exhibition opportunities, including one at the Phillips Collection in Washington, DC, simply because he felt he didn't have enough material of sufficient quality ready. He remained a pre-eminent artist with strong sales and major commissioned projects in the Pacific Northwest. His expressions of northwest atmospheres with their mythological allusions are distinctive, even as they evoke the coastal Skagit River country where he lived. In the 1980s, with his health declining, Anderson arranged to be cared for as an elder, and he became increasingly dependent on a younger companion, Deryl Walls. Walls eventually became executor of his estate, and made the controversial decision to end Anderson's long association with Francine Seders, who had been his agent since 1966.Farr, Sheila. \\"Seders, Francine (b. 1932)\\"; HistoryLink.org Essay 10675 http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?displaypage=output.cfm&file;_id=10675 retvd 6 25 14 Anderson continued living in the house he had built on Caledonia Street, where he received visitors and continued painting into his late eighties. Walls eventually moved Anderson into his own home on Maple Street in La Conner, where Anderson was cared for while surrounded by his paintings. Walls hosted birthday parties for Anderson which were well attended by collectors, fellow artists, and admirers. He remained lucid and enjoyed visitors at La Conner until shortly before he died on April 30, 1998, aged 91 years. Legacy Anderson's work has been included in exhibitions at the Seattle Art Museum, the Henry Art Gallery, the Bellevue Arts Museum, the Tacoma Art Museum, the Museum of Northwest Art in La Conner, the Whatcom Museum in Bellingham, Washington, and the National Museum of Art in Osaka Japan.Woodside/Braseth Gallery, artist biography http://www.woodsidebrasethgallery.com/artists/guy-anderson/ retvd 6 25 14 In 2014, several of his works were included in Modernism in the Pacific Northwest: the Mythic and the Mystical, a major exhibition at the Seattle Art Museum.Upchurch, Michael. \\"A fresh look back at ‚ÄòModernism in the Pacific Northwest‚Äô \\", the Seattle Times, June 18, 2014 ReferencesBibliography * Conkelton, Sheryl, What It Meant to be Modern: Seattle Art at Mid-Century, Henry Art Gallery, Seattle 1999 * Conkelton, Sheryl, and Landau, Laura, Northwest Mythologies: The Interactions of Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, Kenneth Callahan, and Guy Anderson, Tacoma Art Museum, Tacoma WA; University of Washington Press, Seattle and London 2003 * Kingsbury, Martha, Art of the Thirties: The Pacific Northwest, University of Washington Press for Henry Art Gallery, Seattle and London 1972 * Wehr, Wesley, \\" The Accidental Collector \\" University of Washington Press * Wehr, Wesley, \\"The Eighth Lively Art \\" University of Washington Press External links * Guy Anderson collection of the Tacoma Art Museum.

Its staff included many notable artists, and it was widely considered to be one of the nation's most successful FAP art centers. It closed in 1942. Spokane Art Center, front entrance, 1939. Photographer unknown. Archives of American Art/Smithsonian Institution. Background The Federal Art Project was headed by Holger Cahill from its inception in 1935 to its end in 1943. In addition to supporting impoverished artists, and producing artwork for federal government use, Cahill saw the FAP's mission as maintaining the health of American art generally; to this end, support was given to the creation of community art centers, aimed at providing instruction and education for adults and children, as well as gallery space for local and touring WPA/FAP art exhibitions. Working closely with local officials and arts organizations, regional and state FAP directors located areas where interest and support were strong. Once a municipality was able to provide a location and seed money, FAP would provide three to four times the amount in matching funds, as well as teachers, directors, and other staff. The first center opened in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in 1935. Open to all, free of charge, with no race restrictions, the centers proved tremendously popular - despite complaints from some Congressmen and editorialists that they were frivolous and wasteful expenditures. Eventually, 103 FAP art centers were established across the nation, in all 48 states, along with many similar, locally-funded programs.Oral history interview with Holger Cahill, by John Morse, 1960 Apr. 12 and Apr. 15, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution; http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-holger- cahill-11990; retvd 2 3 15\\"Art Within Reach\\": Federal Art Project Community Art Centers; History Matters website; retvd 2 3 15 History The Spokane Art Center was the fiftieth free community art school established under the Federal Art Project. It came about as the result of meetings between Washington State FAP director R. Bruce Inverarity and members of the Spokane Arts Association (many of whom subsequently became SAC Board members). Despite his ardent opposition to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal programs, local newspaperman and business magnate William H. Cowles donated the use of a spacious, three-storey building, while a fund-drive by Parent- Teacher Associations, businesses, and arts associations produced more-than- adequate startup money, gaining $12,000 in federal funds. The center officially opened on September 29, 1938, under the directorship of Carl Morris, a Californian who had been hired by Inverarity.Mahoney, Eleanor: The Spokane Arts Center: Bringing Art to the People; The Great Depression in Washington State website; http://depts.washington.edu/depress/spokane_art_center.shtml retvd 1 31 15 The teaching staff included, at various times, artists Robert Engard,Martin, David F,:Artists of Washington State During World War II; HistoryLink.org Essay 8435; http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=8435; retvd 2 3 15 Guy Anderson, Clyfford Still, Hilda Grossman,Ament, Deloris Tarzan: Iridescent Light: The Emergence of Northwest Art; University of Washington Press, 2002; Z.

Centrally located at North 106 Monroe Street in downtown Spokane, the center attracted several hundred enrollees for adult and children's classes in painting, drawing, sculpture, printmaking, metalwork, and ceramics. Lectures on art history were well-attended, and thousands of people viewed exhibitions presented in the Center's gallery. Despite these successes, avant garde-minded staffers at times butted heads with more conservative Spokanites, and Inverarity's plan to open more community art centers statewide raised considerable ire among the Spokane Art Center's backers, who saw it as a diversion of already sparse resources. These controversies, however, were soon overshadowed by changing wartime priorities, and the Center was shut down in November 1942. In 1952 the name and the basic concept of the Spokane Art Center were revived, in a new location, under the aegis of Washington State University; in 1963 it became the Corbin House Arts and Crafts Center, and in 1970 the Corbin Art Center, operated by Spokane's department of Parks and Recreation.Corbin Art Center website; ; retvd 1 31 15 References External links  * Smithsonian Institution Spokane Art Center records, 1939-1952.

The bank was absorbed into Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena in 2013. In 2008, it was the 9th largest banking group in Italy in terms of customer loans and the 8th largest in terms of total assets, with 1,000 branches, 10,800 employees and ‚Ç¨50bn in assets. The bank only operates in the fragmented Italian market, where it has a market share of roughly 3%, as the 6th largest bank at that time. More precisely, the bank had 8% market share in Veneto, 7% in Friuli, 6% in Sicily and 3% in both Lazio and Emilia Romagna.http://www.borsaitaliana.it/bitApp/view.bit?lang=it‚åñ=StudiDownloadFree&filename;=pdf%2F66727.pdf It has a focus on the wealthy Northeast of the country with 6% market share and 600 branches. Eighty-six percent of its clients are retail clients, accounting for 58% of assets, most of which are owned by affluent and private clients, 12% corporate, accounting for 42% of assets, and 2% institutional. History Banca Antoniana Popolare Veneta was created by the merger in 1996 of two banks, Banca Antoniana and Banca Popolare Veneta, a cooperative bank. =Predecessors= Banca Antoniana traced its origins back to its founding in Padua in 1893 under the name, Banca Cattolica Padovana. Banca Popolare Veneta was also founded in Padua, in this case in 1866 under the name Banca Mutua di Credito Popolare; in 1883 it transformed itself into Banca Cooperativa Popolare. After World War II, it acquired several other cooperative bank () located in Treviso in 1950, Polesine in 1980, Cavarzere in 1982, and Valdagno in 1987. In that same year the bank took the name, Banca Popolare Veneta. =Banca Antoniana Popolare Veneta= In 1997, i.e., one year after the merger, the bank acquired a majority interest in Interbanca, which gave Banca Antonveneta the capability to function as a universal bank, not just a retail bank. Then in 1999 it acquired Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura, which gave it a presence throughout Italy, especially in the south. In 2001 the bank absorbed Banca Cattolica of Molfetta as well as acquired Banca Popolare Jonica of Grottaglie. Since then it has focused more on internally financed growth and in 2002 it switched from being a cooperative society with limited liabilities (S.c. a r.l.) to a publicly traded Societ√† per azioni (S.p.A.), in the Borsa Italiana (Italian stock exchange) as Banca Antoniana Popolare Veneta S.p.A. and as trading name Banca Antonveneta S.p.A. (later also became legal name). Circa 2004 the bank absorbed Banca di Credito Popolare di Siracusa and Banca Agricola Etnea. In the same year Banca Antonveneta sold 30 branches to Banca Nuova and 20 branches to Unipol Banca. As a subsidiary of ABN AMRO In 2005, Dutch financial powerhouse ABN AMRO successfully overcame a scandal-ridden campaign by Italian banking regulators to become the first foreign bank to own an Italian bank. This move has been said to clear the way for other European banks to enter the lucrative Italian market. In early 2006, Antonveneta's shares were delisted from the Italian stock exchange as ABN AMRO acquired more than a 96.7% stake in the banking group by acquiring the shares from other shareholders. Banca Popolare di Lodi (also known as Banca Popolare Italiana), which lost the takeover battle to ABN AMRO, signed a contract to sell the shares of Antonveneta to ABN AMRO in September 2005. In October 2007, a consortium comprising Royal Bank of Scotland, Banco Santander and Fortis acquired ABN AMRO in order to divide its assets between them. In the division of the spoils, Santander received Banca Antonveneta. As a subsidiary of MPS Then on 8 November 2007 Santander announced that it had received and accepted an offer of ‚Ç¨9 billion for Antonveneta from Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS). However, Interbanca was excluded from the sale, which was sold to GE Financial instead in March 2008. The sale of Antonveneta was completed on 30 May 2008. According to news report at that time, the price, in terms of price per branch, was in line with the historic price of similar deal at that time, such as the sale of branches from Banca Intesa to Cr√©dit Agricole. However, after BMPS was bailed out by the government a few years later, the takeover deal was described as \\"draining [BMPS'] cash reserves just as markets were peaking. The deal, which should have raised alarms among regulators, was approved by the Bank of Italy‚Ä¶\\" by a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, Elisa Martinuzzi. As at 31 December 2007 Antonveneta Group (including Interbanca) had a shareholders' equity of ‚Ç¨3.373 billion. After Antonveneta was acquired, an internal reconstruction within MPS Group was made, which New Antonveneta (), a new company incorporated in April 2008, would receive the assets and liabilities of old Antonveneta on 1 January 2009. The shareholders' equity of Antonveneta had changed from ‚Ç¨3.308 billion in December 2009 to ‚Ç¨3.579 billion in December 2010 and then fell to ‚Ç¨2.134 billion in 2011. As of 31 December 2012 the shareholders' equity was ‚Ç¨2.001 billion. In April 2013 Monte dei Paschi finally absorbed Antonventa. It became \\"Area Territoriale Antonveneta\\" of the bank.

By now an Under-21 international, Pistone made 45 appearances for Inter. Pistone also featured in the 1997 UEFA Cup Final, which Inter lost to Schalke 04. =Newcastle United= After an impressive single season at Internazionale, Newcastle United manager Kenny Dalglish signed Pistone for a fee of ¬£4.5 million in July 1997. Despite primarily being a full-back, Pistone made his debut against Sheffield Wednesday as a central defender (a position which he appeared in on a number of occasions in his first season with the Magpies). Pistone played in the 1998 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which Newcastle United lost. After only two games into his second season with the club, Pistone was injured whilst playing away at Chelsea. This game proved to be Dalglish's last for Newcastle United, and he was subsequently sacked, Pistone was subsequently frozen out of the team by Dalglish's replacement, Ruud Gullit. Pistone was not allocated a squad number and was forced to train with the reserve team, along with former club captain Rob Lee. During this time, Pistone was sent out on loan to Venezia for four months, where he made 10 appearances. However, after Gullit was sacked, Pistone was restored to the first team by new manager Bobby Robson, and once again became a first team regular. In his time at Newcastle he scored one league goal, against Middlesbrough in May 2000, in what proved to be his penultimate appearance for the club. =Everton= In July 2000, Pistone was transferred to Everton for a fee in the region of ¬£3 million. He appeared in the first match of the 2000‚Äì01 season before being beset by a succession of injuries (including a six-month layoff for a knee injury). As a result, Pistone only managed to make 8 appearances for the Toffees during his first season. Throughout the 2001‚Äì02 season, Pistone again suffered a major injury, which resulted in him missing most of the campaign. However, during the 2001‚Äì02 season Pistone did score his first goal for the club against Bolton Wanderers. Pistone overcame a succession of injuries, and he featured in the vast majority of Everton's games throughout the 2004‚Äì05 season. However, his contract was due to expire at the end of this season, and with manager David Moyes having doubts about Pistone's ability to remain injury-free, he was only offered a one-year contract. Pistone refused to sign, and looked to be heading out of Goodison Park at the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season. However, with Everton qualifying for the Champions League for the 2005‚Äì06 season, the club were short of defensive cover. As such, he was subsequently offered a new two-year contract, to which he agreed. Pistone returned to Everton's first-team line up for the 2005‚Äì06 season. However, he only managed to feature in 3 games before suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury, ending his season prematurely. Following this, Pistone failed to make a further first-team appearance for Everton, and did not feature at all during the 2006‚Äì07 season. After making 103 appearance for Everton in 7 years, Pistone was eventually released by the club on 14 May 2007. =Free agent= After being released by Everton, on 31 August 2007 it was confirmed by Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate that Pistone was having a trial at the Premier League club and, as Pistone was a free agent, he could be signed after the transfer deadline, giving Southgate more time to decide. It was reported on 9 September 2007 that Southgate had decided against offering Pistone a contract. Pistone also went on trial with Championship side Watford but he could not convince Aidy Boothroyd to offer him a contract.http://www.watford.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=83675 =RAEC Mons= After failing to secure a contract with a club in England, Pistone spent a week on trial with Belgian club RAEC Mons. After impressing manager Geo Van Pyperzeele, Pistone signed for the club on 6 December 2007 until the end of the season, and was given the number 4 jersey. After signing for the club, Pistone was quoted as saying \\"I signed here because I felt that the club immediately believed in me. R.A.E.C. Mons gives me the opportunity to play at a certain level and, very importantly, I felt the confidence of the club and the direction towards me\\". However, after only making four appearances, Pistone left the club at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season. =International career= As part of the Italian Under-21 national team, Pistone won the European Under-21 Championships in 1996. Pistone also played for Italy at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. Coaching career Since retiring, Pistone has coached youth players at Aldini Bariviera and Varese Calcio. In September 2015, he managed the first team of Oggiono in Italy's fifth tier, the Eccellenza. He departed Oggiono in November 2016 due to the club's financial position. The club merged with local rivals Nibiono to become A.S.D. NibionnOggiono. After football Since retiring from football, Pistone has made a number of appearances on the Italian Poker Circuit, and participated in the eight Annual Night of Aces event in 2010. Pistone also owns and runs a restaurant in Milano near Central Station, Italy, which specialises in Piadina.

TMCR was set up as a Restricted Service Licence or 'trial station' to see how it would be received by the communities of Thorne and Moorends. Supported by Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council, and with financial backing through the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund, a four-week period on-air was run from a studio in Thorne. Since starting full-time broadcast, TMCR has become a thriving community radio station going from strength to strength. Launch TMCR was launched with a 28-day trial broadcast in the summer of 2005 on 87.9 FM. The opening was performed by Ed Miliband MP in his capacity as member for Doncaster North. Preparations were being made to start full-time broadcasts from October 2009 with the main launch date pencilled in as 16 November with a frequency of 95.3 FM. Due to funding issues, this date had to be postponed. A new launch date of Monday 14 December 2009 was decided upon, broadcasts commenced at 9.53 am. Test transmissions were heard on 95.3 FM from 27 November. Background In 2005 a temporary studio/office was set up in Thorne town centre. This was used for the short-term broadcast in the summer of that year, then the group moved to The Winning Post, Moorends, in early 2007. Whilst the licence application was being prepared, submitted and achieved, some training sessions were held with local people and students of the Trinity Academy. Due mainly to lack of funding, the studio had been unavailable for long periods of time as much of the work was being done away from the office. Building to licence application An application for a full 5-year licence was submitted to Ofcom in June 2007.Licence application, archived from the original on 5 June 2011. Retrieved 10 December 2015. On 20 December 2007 an announcement was made by OfCom that TMCR was to be offered a five-year community radio licence In January 2008, the committee registered the group as a company limited by guarantee, TMCRFM Limited no. 6471394, in preparation for the future expansion of the group and the service it will offer. Funding applications made in 2009 were intended to have the station return to the airwaves in October 2009 on a full-time basis. This was deferred to 14 December after last minute funding issues. The transmitter site has been determined as SE685134, which gives coverage to Thorne, Moorends, Fishlake, Stainforth, Dunscroft, Hatfield and parts of several other local communities. Clearance of 95.3 as the broadcast frequency has been made by OfCom. Community activity Members of the team are appearing at events in the area, such as the annual Thorne Festival and various shows. The station has the remit to promote all local opportunities, events and services that are provided for the benefit of station listeners. This involves working with other community groups in collating information and making on-air announcements. TMCR have provided PA at many local events during the summer months, appearing at the Thorne Festival, Thorne Regatta, Community As One day, Doncaster Disabled Games, as well as various Sunday afternoons on the bandstand in Thorne Memorial Park.

Counties in the Lead Belt include Saint Francois; Crawford; Dent; Iron; Madison: Reynolds; and Washington. Philip Francois Renault of France led a large exploratory mission in 1719 and started mining operations in Old Mines and Mine La Motte in 1720. The town of Sainte Genevieve was founded as a river port for transportation of lead out of the area. Moses Austin started large-scale mining and smelting at Potosi, originally known as Mine a Breton, and founded Herculaneum as his shipping point on the Mississippi.http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2008/5140/pdf/Chapter1.pdf Seeger, Cheryl M., History of Mining in the Southeast Missouri Lead District and Description of Mine Processes, Regulatory Controls, Environmental Effects, and Mine Facilities in the Viburnum Trend Subdistrict in Kleeschulte, M.J., ed., 2008, Hydrologic investigations concerning lead mining issues in southeastern Missouri: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2008‚Äì5140, Chapter 1 This lead was originally used as a roofing material. Bonne Terre has large subterranean mines, now used commercially for recreational scuba diving. The area of mining has changed over the years. The Old Lead Belt is centered on Park Hills and Desloge, while the New Lead Belt or Viburnum Trend is near Viburnum. The Irish Wilderness in Ripley and Oregon Counties has significant lead ore; however, this is a protected wilderness area. Significant among Missouri's lead mining concerns in the district was the Desloge family and Desloge Consolidated Lead Company in Desloge, Missouri and Bonne Terre‚Äîhaving been active in lead trading, mining and smelting from 1823 in Potosi to 1929. Lead mining operations consolidated under the control of St. Joe Lead. Mineralogy and geology The formal geological name for the Lead Belt is the \\"Southeastern Missouri Mississippi Valley-type Mineral District.\\" It contains the highest concentration of galena (lead(II) sulfide) in the world as well as significant economic quantities of zinc, copper and silver and currently sub- economic quantities of metals such as cadmium, nickel and cobalt. Most of the mined ore minerals are found as sulfides such as galena, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite. Gangue minerals associated with the economic minerals include pyrite, calcite, dolomite, and quartz. Specimens from the Lead Belt are highly prized by gem and mineral collectors and are found in museums worldwide. The ore minerals of the Lead Belt are primarily hosted by bacterial stromatolite reefs and associated oolitic rocks of the dolomitic Bonneterre Formation. This Cambrian age formation was deposited in a shallow sea around the Precambrian age St. Francois Mountains, which formed an island archipelago. Ore mineralization most likely occurred during the late Pennsylvanian and/or Permian periods when warm metal and petroleum bearing fluids from adjacent sedimentary basins migrated through these rocks.Guilbert, John M. and Charles F. Park, Jr., The Geology of Ore Deposits, Freeman, 1986 pp. 890-901 Production The Lead Belt produces about 70% of the US primary supply of lead, and significant amounts of the nation's zinc. In the year 2000, Missouri produced 313,105 tons, with an estimated value of $128,838,880, according to Missouri DNR Data. About 84% of the lead is used for lead‚Äìacid batteries, and a secondary smelter in Boss, Missouri recycles lead‚Äìacid batteries. Another major consumer of Missouri lead is Winchester Ammunition, located in East Alton, Illinois.

The Ropes Mansion (late 1720s), also called Ropes Memorial, is a Georgian Colonial mansion located at 318 Essex Street, located in the McIntire Historic District in Salem, Massachusetts. It is now operated by the Peabody Essex Museum and open to the public. The house was built for Samuel Barnard, a merchant. In 1768, Judge Nathaniel Ropes, Jr., purchased the house from Barnard's nephew. The Ropes family then inhabited the house until 1907, when the house was given to the Trustees of the Ropes Memorial for public benefit. Although altered through the years and then restored, the house looks much like its original form, with a symmetrical facade of two stories, three small pedimented gables through the roof, roof balustrade, and modillioned cornice. (Compare it to the Crowninshield-Bentley House and the Peirce-Nichols House, also in Salem.) In 1807, however, its interior was extensively renovated. In the mid-1830s five rooms and the central hall were remodelled, and today's doorway installed (with details inspired by Asher Benjamin's pattern book.

The album's material focuses on various social and political issues ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. It also presents a turning point in the career of Ice-T, who co-wrote the album's songs with lead guitarist Ernie C and performed as the band's lead singer. Previously known only as a rapper, Ice-T's work with the band helped establish a crossover audience with rock music fans. The album produced the single \\"There Goes the Neighborhood\\". Body Count is well known for the inclusion of the controversial song \\"Cop Killer\\", which was the subject of much criticism from various political figures, although many defended the song on the basis of the group's right to freedom of speech. Ice-T eventually chose to remove the song from the album, although it continues to be performed live. It was voted the 31st best album of the year in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics poll, and is believed to have helped pave the way for the mainstream success of the rap metal genre, although the album itself does not feature rapping in any of its songs. Conception Body Count, as pictured in the album's liner notes. Ice-T formed Body Count out of this interest. The band comprised musicians Ice-T had known from Crenshaw High School. Ice-T states that \\"I knew we didn't want to form an R&B; group. [...] Where am I gonna get the rage and the anger to attack something with that? [...] We knew Body Count had to be a rock band. The name alone negates the band from being R&B.;\\" Ice-T co-wrote the band's music and lyrics with lead guitarist Ernie C, and took on the duties of lead vocalist. Ice-T states that \\"I knew I couldn't sing, but then I thought, 'Who can sing in rock 'n' roll?'\\" Aside from Ice-T and Ernie C, the original line- up consisted of Mooseman on bass, Beatmaster V on drums and D-Roc on rhythm guitar. According to Ice-T, \\"We named the group Body Count because every Sunday night in L.A., I'd watch the news, and the newscasters would tally up the youths killed in gang homicides that week and then just segue to sports. 'Is that all I am,' I thought, 'a body count?'\\" Ice-T introduced the band at Lollapalooza in 1991, devoting half of his set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative rock fans and middle-class teenagers. Many considered the Body Count performances to be the highlight of the tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster. The song \\"Body Count\\" was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a \\"black hardcore band,\\" stating that \\"as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or all that kind of stuff. I just look at it as music. [...] I do what I like and I happen to like rock 'n' roll, and I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music.\\"Ice-T (1991). \\"Body Count\\". O.G. Original Gangster. Sire/Warner Bros. Records. Recording sessions for the group's self-titled debut took place from September to December 1991. The album was released on March 31, 1992, on compact disc, vinyl, and audio cassette. Ice-T states that Body Count was intentionally different from his solo hip hop albums in that \\"An Ice T album has intelligence, and at times it has ignorance. Sometimes it has anger, sometimes it has questions. But Body Count was intended to reflect straight anger. It was supposed to be the voice of the angry brother, without answers. [...] If you took a kid and you put him in jail with a microphone and asked him how he feels, you'd get Body Count: 'Fuck that. Fuck school. Fuck the police.' You wouldn't get intelligence or compassion. You'd get raw anger.\\" From the album, \\"There Goes The Neighborhood\\" was released as a single, while \\"Body Count's in the House\\" was featured in the film Universal Soldier. Music and lyrics { border=\\"0\\" style=\\"font-size:80%; float:right;; color:black;; width:130px;\\"  } Ernie C and Ice-T conceived the album with the dark, ominous tone and Satanic lyrical themes of Black Sabbath in mind. However, Ice-T felt that basing his lyrics in reality would be scarier than the fantasy basis in Black Sabbath's lyrics; the inner artwork depicts a man with a gun pointed at the viewer's face. Ice-T states, \\"To us that was the devil [...] what's more scary than [...] some gangster with a gun pointed at you?\\" Ice-T defined the resulting mix of heavy metal and reality-based lyrics as \\"a rock album with a rap mentality.\\" Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that with Body Count, Ice-T \\"has recognized a kinship between his gangster raps and post-punk, hard-core rock, both of which break taboos to titillate fans. But where rap's core audience is presumably in the inner city, hard-core appeals mostly to suburbanites seeking more gritty thrills than they can get from Nintendo or the local mall.\\" Despite Ice-T's attempts to differentiate Body Count from his work in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song \\"Cop Killer\\" as rap to provoke negative criticism. \\"There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get a lot of people who think, 'Rap- black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac ‚Äî that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song.\\" Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that \\"A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] [We] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed.\\" Lyrical themes The final image of the \\"There Goes the Neighborhood\\" music video. Like Ice-T's gangsta rap albums, Body Count's material focused on various social and political issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, \\"Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach, we sing about the way we grew up.\\" Ice-T states that \\"Body Count was an angry record. It was meant to be a protest record. I put my anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor.\\" The spoken introduction, \\"Smoked Pork\\" features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: \\"Nah, that's not my job! My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out!\\", then telling him that \\"my job is eatin' these doughnuts\\". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is Ice-T confirming his identity.Body Count (1992). \\"Smoked Pork\\". Body Count. Sire/Warner Bros. Records. In the lyrics of \\"KKK Bitch,\\" Ice-T describes a sexual encounter with a woman who he soon learns is the daughter of the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. The lyrics go on to describe a scenario in which members of Body Count \\"crash\\" a Klan meeting to \\"get buck wild with the white freaks\\". Ice-T makes humorous reference to \\"[falling] in love with Tipper Gore's two 12-year-old nieces\\", and ponders the possibility of the Grand Wizard coming after him \\"when his grandson's named little Ice-T.\\"Body Count (1992). Body Count. Lyrics sheet. Sire/Warner Bros. Records. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that \\"'KKK Bitch' was ironic because the sentiments were true. We'd play Ku Klux Klan areas in the South and the girls would always come backstage and tell us how their brothers and fathers didn't like black folks. [...] We knew that 'KKK Bitch' would totally piss off the Ku Klux Klan. There's humor in the song, but it fucks with them. It's on a punk tip.\\" \\"Voodoo\\" describes a fictional encounter between Ice-T and an old woman with a voodoo doll. \\"The Winner Loses\\" describes the downfall of a crack cocaine user. \\"There Goes the Neighborhood\\" is a sarcastic response to critics of Body Count, sung from the point of view of a racist white rocker who wonders \\"Don't they know rock's just for whites? / Don't they know the rules? / Those niggers are too hardcore / This shit ain't cool.\\" For the song's music video, the word \\"nigger\\" was replaced with the phrase \\"black boys\\". The music video ends with a black musician implanting an electric guitar into the ground and setting it on fire. The final image is similar to that of a burning cross.Body Count (1992). \\"There Goes The Neighborhood\\". Music video. Body Count. Sire/Warner Bros. Records. \\"Evil Dick\\" focuses on male promiscuity. Its lyrics describe a married man who is led to seek strange women after his \\"evil dick\\" tells him \\"Don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone.\\" \\"Momma's Gotta Die Tonight\\" follows the account of a black teenager who murders and dismembers his racist mother after she reacts negatively when he brings a white girl home. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that the song's lyrics are metaphorical, explaining that \\"Whoever is still perpetuating racism has got to die, not necessarily physically, but they have to kill off that part of their brain. From now on, consider it dead. The entire attitude is dead.\\" Ice-T referred to the album's final track, \\"Cop Killer\\" as a protest song, stating that the song is \\"[sung] in the first person as a character who is fed up with police brutality.\\" The song was written in 1990, and had been performed live several times, including at Lollapalooza, before it had been recorded in a studio. The album version mentions then-Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and the black motorist Rodney King, whose beating by LAPD officers was recorded on videotape. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that the song \\"[is] a warning, not a threat‚Äîto authority that says, 'Yo, police: We're human beings. Treat us accordingly.'\\" In an interview for Rolling Stone, Ice-T stated that \\"We just celebrated the fourth of July, which is really just national Fuck the Police Day [...] I bet that during the Revolutionary War, there were songs similar to mine.\\" Release and reception Initial copies of the album were shipped out in black body bags, a promotional device that drew minor criticism. The album debuted at No. 32 on Billboard's Top 50 albums, peaking at No. 26 on the Billboard 200. By January 29, 1993, the album sold 480,000 copies, according to Variety. However, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, Body Count was certified gold for sale shipments in excess of 500,000 copies, with a certification date back to August 4, 1992. In a positive review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau said Ice-T \\"takes rap's art- ain't-life defense over the top\\" on a heavy metal album which utilizes and parodies \\"the style's whiteskin privilege\\". He wrote that the music is \\"flat- out hard rock, short on soloistic intricacy and fancy structures\\", but that it is set apart from other metal by Ice-T, who \\"describes racism in language metalheads can understand, kills several policemen, and cuts his mama into little pieces because she tells him to hate white people. This can be a very funny record.\\" Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, felt the lyrics on some songs are pathologically flawed and off-putting, but the band's take on metal styles is impressive and, \\"on the stereotype-bashing 'There Goes the Neighborhood,' the humor, message and music coalesce brilliantly\\". Don Kaye of Kerrang! called Body Count a \\"noisy, relentless musical attack\\". In a less enthusiastic review for Rolling Stone, J. D. Considine wrote that \\"messages\\" are less important here than \\"the sort of sonic intensity parental groups fear even more than four-letter words,\\" while AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album \\"a surprisingly tepid affair\\" partly because \\"all of Ice-T's half-sung/half-shouted lyrics fall far short of the standard he established on his hip-hop albums.\\" In the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of prominent critics published by The Village Voice, Body Count was voted the 31st best album of 1992. Christgau, the poll's supervisor, ranked it 22nd on his own year-end list. In 2017, Rolling Stone listed the album at No. 90 on its list of the 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time. Controversy The album was originally set to be distributed under the title Cop Killer, named for the song, which criticizes violent police officers. During the production of the album, Warner Bros. executives were aware of the potential controversy that the album and song could cause, but supported it. At a Time-Warner shareholders' meeting, actor Charlton Heston stood and read lyrics from the song \\"KKK Bitch\\" to an astonished audience and demanded that the company take action. Sire responded by changing the title to Body Count, but did not remove the song. In an article for The Washington Post', Tipper Gore condemned Ice-T for songs like \\"Cop Killer,\\" writing that \\"Cultural economics were a poor excuse for the South's continuation of slavery. Ice-T's financial success cannot excuse the vileness of his message [...] Hitler's anti-Semitism sold in Nazi Germany. That didn't make it right.\\" The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas launched a campaign to force Warner Bros. Records to withdraw the album. CLEAT called for a boycott of all products by Time-Warner in order to secure the removal of the song and album from stores. Within a week, they were joined by police organizations across the United States. Ice-T asserted that the song was written from the point of view of a fictional character, and told reporters that \\"I ain't never killed no cop. I felt like it a lot of times. But I never did it. If you believe that I'm a cop killer, you believe David Bowie is an astronaut,\\" in reference to Bowie's song \\"Space Oddity\\". { border=\\"0\\" style=\\"font-size:80%; float:right;; color:black;; width:130px;\\"  } The National Black Police Association opposed the boycott of Time-Warner and the attacks on \\"Cop Killer,\\" identifying police brutality as the cause of much anti-police sentiment and proposed the creation of independent civilian review boards \\"to scrutinize the actions of our law enforcement officers\\" as a way of ending the provocations that caused artists such as Body Count \\"to respond to actions of police brutality and abuse through their music. [...] Many individuals of the law enforcement profession do not want anyone to scrutinize their actions, but want to scrutinize the actions of others.\\" Critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence. Others defended the album on the basis of the group's right to freedom of speech, and cited the fact that Ice-T had portrayed a police officer in the film New Jack City. Ice-T is quoted as saying that \\"I didn't need people to come in and really back me on the First Amendment. I needed people to come in and say 'Ice-T has grounds to make this record.' I have the right to make it because the cops are killing my people. So fuck the First Amendment, let's deal with the fact that I have the right to make it.\\" Over the next month, controversy against the band grew. Vice President Dan Quayle branded \\"Cop Killer\\" as being \\"obscene,\\" and President George H.W. Bush publicly denounced any record company that would release such a product. Body Count was removed from the shelves of a retail store in Greensboro, North Carolina after local police had told the management that they would no longer respond to any emergency calls at the store if they continued to sell the album. In July 1992, the New Zealand Police Commissioner unsuccessfully attempted to prevent an Ice-T concert in Auckland, arguing that \\"Anyone who comes to this country preaching in obscene terms the killing of police, should not be welcome here,\\" before taking Body Count and Warner Bros. Records to the Indecent Publications Tribunal, in an effort to get it banned under New Zealand's Indecent Publications Act. This was the first time in 20 years that a sound recording had come before the censorship body, and the first ever case involving popular music. After reviewing the various submissions, and listening carefully to the album, the Tribunal found the song \\"Cop Killer\\" to be \\"not exhortatory,\\" saw the album as displaying \\"an honest purpose,\\" and found Body Count not indecent. The controversy escalated to the point where death threats were sent to Time-Warner executives, and stockholders threatened to pull out of the company. Finally, Ice-T decided to remove \\"Cop Killer\\" from the album of his own volition, a decision which was met by criticism from other artists who derided Ice-T for \\"caving in to external pressure.\\" In an interview, Ice-T stated that \\"I didn't want my band to get pigeon-holed as that's the only reason that record sold. It just got outta hand and I was just tired of hearing it. I said, 'fuck it,' I mean they're saying we did it for money, and we didn't. I'd gave the record away, ya know, let's move on, let's get back to real issues, not a record, but the cops that are out there killing people.\\" \\"Cop Killer\\" was replaced by a new version of \\"Freedom of Speech,\\" a song from Ice-T's 1989 solo album The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say. The song was re-edited and remixed to give it a more rock- oriented sound, using a looped sample from the Jimi Hendrix song \\"Foxy Lady.\\" Alongside the album's reissue, Warner Bros. issued \\"Cop Killer\\" as a single. Ice-T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over his solo album Home Invasion, taking Body Count with him. The studio version of \\"Cop Killer\\" has not been re-released, although a live version of the song appears on Body Count's 2005 release Live in L.A. According to Ernie C, the controversy over the song \\"still lingers for us, even now. I'll try to book clubs and the guy I'm talking to will mention it and I'll think to myself 'Man, that was 17 years ago.' But I meet a lot of bands who ask me about it, too, and I'm real respected by other artists for it. But it's a love/hate thing. Ice gets it too, even though he plays a cop on TV now on Law & Order SVU.\\" In Australia, the track listings on copies of the new version of the album sold there ended at track 16, omitting \\"Freedom of Speech\\" (or \\"Cop Killer\\" and its spoken word intro, \\"Out in the Parking Lot\\"). This was likely because the track \\"Freedom of Speech\\" refers to the speech protections of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which Australia does not have an equivalent to in its own Constitution, thus the track is not as relevant to Australian audiences.

The game was originally created by Damon Slye for the Apple II and Commodore 64 in 1983. It was followed by three sequels, Arcticfox (1986), Nova 9: The Return of Gir Draxon (1991), and Stellar 7: Draxon's Revenge (1993), and was remade in the early 1990s for the 16-bit computers. Gameplay Gameplay of the 1983 Apple II version The player's tank, the Raven, has a front-facing cannon with an unlimited supply of bullets. The cannon can fire up to two shots at a time. The tank also has a cloaking device that, when triggered, would render it invisible to enemies for about a minute. Gauges on the right side of the screen indicate the amount of shields and power remaining. The tank starts with enough power to cloak twice, and power slowly trickles away as the time passes. The game ends when either shields or power runs out. Each of the seven levels represents a different star system (hence the title). The player's objective is to get to the last level and defeat the enemy boss, Gir Draxon. Each level is depicted as a nearly featureless plane dotted by geometric obstacles‚Äîsome indestructible and most not‚Äîand various enemies. After the player destroys a certain number of enemies, a warp link will appear that provides a gateway to the next level. Special power-ups can be accessed by pressing the tab key to toggle between the different icons at the bottom left of the screen and then pushing enter, or simply by pushing the letter key corresponding to the desired icon. The icon for the chosen item will turn purple while activated. Each power-up is represented by a certain symbol and can be used up to three times throughout the game, depending on the difficulty setting. Note that the later DOS / PC version of this game was somewhat different. The graphics were more advanced and rendered in a full range of colors for the time, as were the more complex world background paintings. Also, the cloaking device was not integrated into the tank and did not end the game or destroy the tank when it ended. Each world also was guarded by a boss that had to be defeated before the warp-link to the next level would appear. Most of the bosses were not particularly complicated compared to the sequel (Nova 9), but they presented a reasonable challenge for the time. The power-up system also worked differently. By killing 3 of specific enemy types, you would get a power-up dropped, which would then activate when you touched it; different enemies produced different power-ups following this system. Finally, the game had a \\"Continue\\" feature, vs simply ending when the tank was destroyed. Other differences may have existed between the enemy types and behaviors; the same applies to power-ups. Plot The game's plot is relatively straightforward. Gir Draxon, an evil alien overlord in charge of a powerful interstellar empire has conquered a range of star systems and has now arrived in our solar system on Mars, intending on crushing humanity. The hero of the story has a super-tank that he can use to defeat Draxon's forces, though it was called into service before being finished and thus is protected only by energy shields and has no armor. From a game mechanics perspective, this explains why the tank simply is destroyed when its shields (hitpoints) run out. The hero fights his way through 7 star systems controlled by Draxon's empire, until arriving on the last planet - Arcturus itself - to face Gir Draxon. The alien overlord confronts the hero in personal combat in his own super-tank; when defeated, an escape pod is clearly seen rocketing off into space, making it clear that Draxon survived. Note that the second game in the series (Nova 9) would vastly expand the in-game plot, adding cut scenes, dialog, and more story-related tension. Not much information is provided about the world's background at the time. Reception Softline stated in 1983 that \\"Combining first-rate graphics and sound effects with fast-paced, arcade-style excitement makes Stellar 7 hard to beat in every sense\\". Video magazine reviewed the Apple II version of the game, describing it as \\"a severe test for even the most skillful home arcaders\\" whose \\"varied action makes it a particularly satisfying game for solo players.\\" Tom Clancy in 1988 named Stellar 7 one of his two favorite computer games, stating that \\"it is so unforgiving, it is just like life\\". In 1991 the DOS version of the remake received 5 out of 5 stars in Dragon.

As his achievements increased he became better known as the King of the Fells or simply the Iron Man.  Biography  Naylor was born in 1936 in Middle Row Farm, Wasdale Head, and attended school in Gosforth, leaving at 15 to work on the family farm. Injuries in his youth led to operations aged 19 to remove cartilage from his right knee and aged 22 to remove two disks from his back. He took up running in 1960 aged 24, winning his first race, the Mountain Trial, in 1966. In 1971, he completed the Bob Graham Round, only the sixth person to do so, and continued to win races and set records through the 1970s and 1980s. In 1978, following medical advice that his back was deteriorating, he reduced his farming activities (selling his cattle but retaining his sheep), and took a job training apprentices at Windscale. In his seventies, he started spending winters in Spain, as cold weather caused circulation problems in his legs. He married Mary in 1963. Their son, Paul, has now taken over the farm.  Fell-running achievements  His fell running achievements include successive peak bagging records within the scope of the Bob Graham Round: *1971: 61 peaks in 23h37m *1972: 63 peaks in 23h35m *1975: 72 peaks, claimed to involve over 100 miles and about 38,000 feet of ascent in 23h20m (record stood until 1988) His other fell running achievements include: * 1971: The National Three Peaks Challenge (Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon): 11 hours 54 minutes including driving time *1973: The Welsh 3000s - the 14 peaks of Snowdonia in 4 hours 46 minutes (record stood until 1988) * 1974: The Pennine Way: 3 days, 4 hours, 36 minutes (record stood until 1989) *1976: Robin Hood Bay to St Bees: 41 hours *1979: The Lyke Wake Walk: 4 hours 53 minutes (set during the annual race) (record stood until 1981) * 1983: The Lakes, Meres and Waters circuit of 105 miles: 19 hours 20 minutes * 1986: (age 50) completed the Wainwrights in 7 days, 1 hour, 25 minutes (record stood until 2014) * 1997: (age 60) ran 60 Lakeland fell tops in 36 hours * 2006: (age 70) ran 70 Lakeland fell tops, covering more than 50 miles and ascending more than 25,000 feet, in under 21 hours.  Legacy  He considered the 72 peak Lakeland circuit as his own greatest achievement, setting a record which stood unbroken for 13 years. He was appointed an MBE for his services to sport and charity, and is included as one of Britain‚Äôs top 100 sports personalities in the 2007 book Best of British: Hendo‚Äôs Sporting Heroes, by sports journalist Jon Henderson.Best of British: Hendo's Sporting Heroes, Jon Henderson (Yellow Jersey Press) 2007, Olympic Gold medal winner and co-founder of the London Marathon Chris Brasher described Joss Naylor as 'The Greatest of Them All', a title he bestowed on Joss when he ran 72 Lake District mountains in 24 hours.Keith Richardson, Joss (Keswick, 2009). Naylor completed some of his achievements in extreme weather conditions (the 1972 63 peaks record in a severe storm, and the 1975 72 peaks record and large sections of the 1986 Wainwrights record in a heat wave), and he is noted for his ability to persevere despite pain and adversity. He is also noted for his humility and his generosity towards less talented runners, and in keeping with British fell-running traditions, he has frequently provided support or pacing for other runners attempting the same or similar challenges. However, on occasion he has been less enthusiastic about runners who differ from his approach by setting records only in optimum conditions or who use more scientific methods such as use of spreadsheets for planning attempts. He created his own fell-running challenge, the Joss Naylor Lakeland Challenge, open to over-fifties only. This runs 48 miles (77 km) from Pooley Bridge to Greendale Bridge, traversing 30 summits, with climbing of 17,000 feet (5182 m). Naylor is the subject of a biography by Keith Richardson,Keith Richardson, Joss (Keswick, 2009) and his fell running exploits are covered in detail in Steve Chilton's It's a hill, get over it: fell running's history and characters and in Richard Askwith's Feet in the Clouds.

Started from an idea in the summer of 1972, supported by the Worksop Lions, Radio Kilton had its 1st Broadcast on Saturday 2 December. In the beginning, equipment was limited and programmes consisting of music and requests only went out at the weekend. By Autumn of 1976 the station had its first purpose built facility, known today as Studio 2. In the following years membership and programming expanded and soon after the radio had its first outside broadcast. Continued expansion was seen in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2000, broadcasting went on free-to-air on 1278 MW, broadcasting 24/7. After a little more organization came another name change to what we know now as Trust AM. In December 2019 the station launched its Listen on-line service. Whilst Trust AM retains the name that listeners have come to know, the AM broadcasts on 1278 ceased at the end of 2019. Over at Doncaster, Radio Danum started in November 1980 and within a year was broadcasting over 74 hours a week with over 48 presenters. The station had a varied output even back then. In its first year it was attending events like the Finningley Air Show. The station even had their own amateur dramatic productions. Over the years Radio Danum became more successful and even had a special anniversary broadcast in the week the station became 10 years old! However, since the mid to late 1990s the station suffered from a lack of volunteers and funding. Since then the station has been incorporated with Trust AM to become part of the larger organization. An updated Doncaster studio was (re)opened in September 2005. Staffed by volunteers and operating 24 hours a day, the station aims to provide \\"More Variety\\" to its listeners with a blend of music based mainly on the 1950s to the present day, but with even older songs added to the mix. Listeners can get a request played on any live show, Trust AM also broadcasts specialist shows for Love songs, Country, Soul, Musicals and much more. The charity is controlled by an Executive Committee who meet at least 4 times per year. The management team meet in between those times to discuss the day-to-day running of the station. Unlike most radio stations, Trust AM do not have a single station manager. Instead, a team of up to 9 members share the responsibilities and make joint decisions. This has proved to be a very successful formula. Bassetlaw Hospital has two studios, while Doncaster Royal Infirmary has a office/studio. All are equipped to a high specification with many modes available to the on-air presenter. From gramophone records, through cassette tape, to CD and even computerised playout systems. A jingle player system, using a touchscreen monitor, was installed in May 2009. The music library holds in excess of 170,000 tracks. Listeners can hear the broadcasts via headsets connected to an internet capable device using the hospital Wi-Fi network. The station is available on-line at www.trustam.com/listen The Oldest DJ In Town, Len Bratley, was 85 years old in 2011 and presented two Nostalgia themed shows per week, covering the earlier part of the 20th century. Bratley had been featured in several newspapers and even appeared on TV for his role with the station. He died on 25 August 2011.

In 1616, fearing the Dutch, the natives of the island pledged their allegiance to the employees of English East India Company, who accepted it on behalf of the Crown. According to historian John Keay who considers Pulo Run as the genesis of the British Empire : \\"As the island of Runnymede is to British constitutional history, so the island of Run is to British imperial history\\". In the 17th century, the tiny island of Run was of great economic importance because of the value of the spices nutmeg and mace. Geography Run is the westernmost island of the Banda Islands, with a length of and width of . The neighboring island of Pulau Ai is about 7 km east and the small islet of Pulau Nailakka is 700 m north.  History  Map of Run Island dated 1623 Pulau Run c. 1790 During the history of the spice trade, sailors of the English East India Company of the second expedition of James Lancaster, John Davis, Sir Henry Middleton and his brother John who stayed in Bantam on Java, first reached the island in 1603 and developed good contacts with the inhabitants. A small settlement was first attempted on Pulau Nailakka.On December25, 1616, Captain Nathaniel Courthope and 1st mate Zachary Barnett Duncan reached Run to defend it against the claims of the Dutch East India Company. A contract with the inhabitants was signed, accepting James I of England/James VI of Scotland as sovereign of the island. The Dutch were outraged over this threat to their monopoly on the extremely profitable spice trade. Courthope fortified the island by erecting forts to overlook approaches from the east, but lost two ships to mutiny and sinking by the Dutch, when they laid siege to the island. Courthope and 39 European defenders with their native allies held off the Dutch for 1540 days; however, after his death in a Dutch attack in 1620, the English departed the island. Finally in possession of Run, the Dutch proceeded to kill or enslave all adult men, exile the women and children and chop down every nutmeg tree on the island to prevent the English from retaking it. The VOC only allowed cattle to roam free on Run to provide food for the other islands. It was not until 1638 that the English tried to access Run again, after which VOC officials annually visited the island to check if they had secretly re-established themselves. According to the Treaty of Westminster ending the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652-1654), Run should have been returned to England. After the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667), England and the United Provinces of the Netherlands agreed in the Treaty of Breda to the status quo: the English kept the island of Manhattan, which the Duke of York (the future James II, brother of Charles II), had occupied in 1664, renaming the city on that island from New Amsterdam to New York. In return, Run was formally abandoned to the Dutch. The Dutch monopoly on nutmeg and mace was destroyed by the transfer of nutmeg trees to Ceylon, Grenada, Singapore and other British colonies in 1817, after the capture of the Spice islands in 1810 by Captain Cole, leading to the decline of the Dutch supremacy in the spice trade. Dutch control of the island ended in 1949, but there are still nutmeg trees growing on Run today. Administration Run Island is part of the Banda Islands group which had a total population of around 19,000 at the 2010 census. The main town of the group is Banda Naira on Banda Naira Island. Administratively, Run Island is included in the Banda Sub- district (kecamatan) which is one of 18 Sub-districts within the Central Maluku Regency (population in 2015, around 367,300). The Regency is in turn part of the province of Maluku (population in 2015, almost 1,684,000), the capital city of which is Ambon on Ambon Island. Banda Naira is connected by sea and air transport to Ambon. Bandanaira airport is one of the smaller airports in Indonesia, used mainly by administrative staff or by tourists who visit Banda Islands for the snorkeling and diving opportunities in the region.

It was three metres (10 feet) tall and weighed half a tonne (1100 lbs). It inhabited subtropical open woodlands in Australia during the Late Miocene and may have been carnivorous. It was heavier than Aepyornis and taller than the moa. Due to the poor fossil record of Dromornis australis (the type species of the genus) and the large time gap between the two Dromornis species, D. stirtoni may eventually be reassigned to the genus Bullockornis. This species had a long neck and stub-like wings, rendering it flightless. Its legs were powerful, but it is not believed to have been a fast runner. The bird's beak was large and immensely powerful, leading early researchers to believe that it was used to shear through tough plant stalks. However, recently others have argued that the size of the beak suggests that the bird was a carnivore. The only recorded location of the species is at Alcoota Station in the central region of Australia's Northern Territory. When she discovered it, Patricia Vickers-Rich named the bird after fellow palaeontologist Ruben A. Stirton.

Gates (July 17, 1935 ‚Äì March 20, 2004) was the last survivor of the segregated 95th Engineers Combat Battalion, which was used for human fallout exposure testing. They were stationed in closest vicinity during atomic blasting at Camp Desert Rock in Nevada in 1954. He was quoted as saying, \\"there is no reckoning why the government would hurt its own people.\\" At age 15 Gates saw combat in Korea, was captured, jailed and beaten. Upon returning to the United States in 1953, Jim's unit was first shipped to Ft. Leonard Wood in Missouri for 8 weeks of basic and special project training, including gas exposure. In 1954, his unit was sent to Yakima Washington, where Jim and the others worked as extras in the Audie Murphy movie \\"To Hell and Back\\". Jim said the movie title was Providential. By July of that year, his unit was sent to Nevada by night-train to prevent the men going AWOL, and at that time told not to reveal what awaited them in Camp Desert Rock (below Camp Mercury) under the penalty of red balling when they became civilian. Jim dug ditches, built fake towns and set explosive devices because he was a munitions expert. It was also his job to round up jack rabbits to put in cages, not only to be used as atomic test victims, but whose bones would mingle and cover those of sacrificed men nicknamed \\"Desert Rats,\\" who were put in \\"monkey cages,\\" or tied to fences closest to detonation. These acts have been documented on film, and show that the military used racial experiments with impunity. Jim himself, was within a 1/2 mile radius from at least 7 types of bombs without other protection or cover except a trench. He was involved in a series of 14 nuclear explosions in Operation Teapot and Operation MET.A Long Way to Go to Be Ignored: The Last Atomic Veterans WISE News Communique. Bob Rudner. March 15, 1996. One explosion blew him out of a trench and he awoke 11 days later in the military hospital finding his arm and leg undergoing surgical reconstruction.Justice for Atomic Veterans Huffington Post. Vincent Intondi. 15/03/14. Retrieved: 16/05/18 He asked then for a medical discharge, but it was denied him. Along with the other men, he ingested radioactive water and food, breathed radioactive air‚Äîall the while being counseled by military chaplains that these were harmless. To counteract this horror, Jim knew enough to act by driving out into the desert at night to cut the wires he set up that day, to create a delay in detonation. In doing so he would be arrested. While hitching along a military border road, he was picked up by journalist Paul Jacobs. After becoming friends, Jim gave him insider knowledge. Jacobs formally interviewed him and others, publishing a series of stories which helped blow the lid off the secrecy surrounding atomic testing. Jim's testimony was included into the 1980 documentary \\"Paul Jacobs and the Nuclear Gang\\" produced by Saul Landau. Jim was also in a 1995 British production \\"Geiger Sweet Geiger Sour\\" (which movie is banned in the U.S.). After Jim's duties in Nevada, he was shipped to Germany, and then back to the United States to teach chemical, nuclear and biological warfare at Nike ABM bases. Back in Chicago and not able to retire, he continued in the Army Reserves. Jim married and had 8 children and 29 grandchildren. He drove taxi cabs, worked in a steel mill and a post office, and opened his own restaurant. Even so, he was denied Social Security and was homeless for 12 of those years, suffering a heart attack during that time, with no insurance benefits. The radioactive poisoning had settled in his connective tissues, his lungs, joints, muscles and teeth, causing him major organ failures over the years, including a burst appendix followed by heart failure, all of which he miraculously survived to the amazement of doctors, and which two were suffered on the 40th anniversary of Operation TEAPOT. Jim never gave up his fight for the military benefits denied him. He was interviewed many times, including a 1994 in-depth interview. This article, entitled \\"The Legal Fallout\\" was featured (front cover) in an ABA Law Journal, and caused controversy between the American Bar Association and the government. Jim also joined the Atomic Veterans Association, the Alliance of Atomic Veterans, and would attend the Vietnam Veterans Against the War rallies to befriend the homeless vets. Since 1986, he participated in civil disobedience actions against weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site. He attended rallies and conferences in Washington, New York City, San Francisco, Berkeley, Las Vegas and Chicago. He also worked closely with political leaders, including Mayor Harold Washington and Senators Carol Moseley Braun and Paul Simon. Jim's last trip to Nevada was when the Shoshone Indians gave him a memorial plaque for his friendship and concern. Jim was able to receive a date for a landmark hearing on his case before the Court of Appeals in Washington, but died just two and a half months before he could attend. He is buried at the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery. ReferencesNotations= *vvaw.org gallery *vvaw.org veteran article *chicagogreens.org *antenna.nl *6-page personal statement signed by James M.

The U.S. Congress designated it a wilderness in 1984. The Irish Wilderness is located within the Eleven Point Ranger District of the Mark Twain National Forest, northeast of Alton, Missouri. The Irish Wilderness is one of eight wilderness areas protected and preserved in Missouri. Hiking and horseback riding are popular on the White's Creek Trail, an 18.6 miles trail throughout the wilderness. Attractions include White's Creek Cave (temporarily gated to protect endangered bats), Fiddler and Bliss Springs, traces of old tramway railroads, and overlooks of the Eleven Point River. The karst topography of the area creates very scenic views along this trail. Wildlife present include black bear, mountain lion, whitetail deer, timber rattlesnakes, turkey, and bald eagles.  History  The Irish Wilderness was historically a settlement of Irish immigrants in Oregon and Ripley Counties founded in 1858 by an Irish Catholic Priest, John Joseph Hogan. The settlement was wiped out during the American Civil War and has remained a wilderness ever since. = The Settlers = The settlers of the Irish Wilderness came from St. Louis, which had a high influx of Irish immigrants in the 1840s. The Irish immigrants in St. Louis were discriminated against, and were largely employed by the railroad and mining industries. Bishop John Joseph Hogan saw the potential for the immigrants to have their own land, to farm and settle in families.Michael C. O‚ÄôLaughlin, Missouri Irish: The Original History of the Irish in Missouri, 2nd ed. (Kansas City, Missouri: Irish Genealogical Foundation, 2007). Some land in Oregon and Ripley Counties was bought and donated by a Reverend James Fox. In 1859, there were around forty families who began to settle in the wilderness, and more were on their way. The settlement's western border was the Eleven Point River in Oregon County, from there extending east past the Current River in Ripley County, as far east as Doniphan, Missouri.Mike Crawford, Father Hogan‚Äôs 1859 Irish Wilderness Settlement (Doniphan, Missouri: The Prospect- News). = Destruction of the Settlement = The settlement was in existence only from about 1859 through 1863. During the Civil War, the roads that crossed straight through the heart of the settlement, including the Old Bellevue (or Bellview) Road, made the settlers vulnerable to Union and Confederate troops, murderers and criminals. By the end of 1863, the settlement had been destroyed, and all settlers had fled or died. Union Major James Wilson was a factor in the destruction of the settlement. Jerry Ponder (1937-2005) is responsible for much of the research about the Civil War in the area of southern Missouri, especially Ripley County.

She sometimes recorded under the pseudonyms Sadie Green, Caroline Lee, and possibly Helen Richards. Brown was active as a recording artist from 1925 to 1929. She should not be confused (although often is in biographies and discographies) with the Bessie Brown who recorded vaudeville and blues-styled duets with George W. Williams, over a similar timespan. Life and career Brown was born in Marysville, Ohio. She recorded between November 10, 1925, and April 1, 1929. In her concurrent vaudeville career, she sometimes performed as a male impersonator. She also appeared in revues, including Moonshine Revue, The Whirl of Joy and Dark-Town Frolics, and on the stage as a cabaret performer, primarily on the East Coast. On her recordings she sang in a deepened tone, without any notable African-American dialect. Thus, to more than one commentator, her style was similar to that of Sophie Tucker. On her recordings Brown was backed by some of the best Harlem-based musicians of the time, including Thomas Morris and Rex Stewart (cornet); Charlie Irvis and Charlie Green (trombone); Coleman Hawkins and Buster Bailey (saxophone); Buddy Christian and Clarence Holiday (banjo); and Porter Grainger, Clarence Williams and Fletcher Henderson (piano). She left the music industry in 1932 and married Clarence Shaw in the early 1930s. She had one child, Helen Smith Mcreynolds, from her first marriage. She died of a heart attack in 1955. The bulk of her known recorded work was issued as a compilation album, Complete Recorded Works (1925‚Äì29), by Document Records in 1996.

It tries also to allow Linux distribution-agnostic binary software deployment for application developers, also called upstream packaging. Released first in 2004 under the name klik, it was continuously developed, then renamed in 2011 to PortableLinuxApps and later in 2013 to AppImage. DescriptionObjectives= AppImage aims to be an application deployment system for Linux with the following objectives: simplicity, binary compatibility, distro agnosticism, no installation, no root permission, being portable, and keeping the underlying operating system untouched.AppImage: Linux apps that run anywhere on youtube.com by Peter Simon (June 2016) =Properties= AppImage does not install the application in the traditional Linux sense. Instead of putting the application's various files in the distro's appropriate places in the file system, the AppImage file is just the application's compressed image. When it runs, the file is mounted with FUSE. This behavior is consistent with AppImage's predecessors, klik and PortableLinuxApps. It uses one file per application. Each file is self-contained: it includes all libraries the application depends on that are not already part of the targeted base-system. An AppImage of version 1.0 is an ISO 9660 Rock Ridge file (which can be optionally zisofs compressed) containing a minimal AppDir and a tiny runtime. (Version 2 may use other file system image formats like SquashFS). An AppImage application can be added to a live CD by adding only one file to the live CD. AppImage files are simpler than installing an application. No extraction tools are needed, nor is it necessary to modify the operating system or user environment. Regular users on the common Linux distributions can download it, make it executable, and run it. AppImage allows generation of embedded digital signature, which need to be verified with an external utility. The format does not offer form of self-check with package authenticity verification or runtime confinement by sandboxing. Historyklik= klik installing an application AppImage's predecessor klik was designed in 2004 by Simon Peter. The client-side software is GPL-licensed. klik integrated with web browsers on the user's computer. Users downloaded and installed software by typing a URL beginning with \`klik://\`. This downloaded a klik \\"recipe\\" file, which was used to generate a .cmg file. For main ingredients, usually pre-built .deb packages from Debian Stable repositories were fed into the recipe's .cmg generation process. In this way, one recipe could be used to supply packages to a wide variety of platforms. With klik, only eight programs could be run at once because of the limitation of mounting compressed images with the Linux kernel, unless FUSE was used. The file was remounted each time the program is run, meaning the user could remove the program by simply deleting the .cmg file. A next version, klik2, was in development; and would natively incorporate the FUSE kernel module, but it never reached past the beta stage.Screen capture video of Klik2 on video.google.com (archived) Around 2011, the klik project went dormant and the homepage went offline for some time. =PortableLinuxApps= Simon Peter started a successor project named PortableLinuxApps with similar goals around that time. The technology was adapted for instance by the \\"portablelinuxgames.org\\" repository, providing hundreds of mostly open-source video games. =AppImage= Around 2013, the software was renamed again from portableLinuxApps to AppImage; the license became the MIT license. AppImage is the format and AppImageKit is a concrete open source implementation. The development happens in a GitHub repository. Reception and usage Klik was in 2007 the inspiration for Alexander Larsson's glick project, the precursor of Flatpak which was released in 2016.Experiments with run-timeless app bundles by Alex Larsson (2007) Linus Torvalds' dive log application Subsurface started to use AppImage around 2015. Subsurface's traditional packaging was changed to a portable, self-contained, distro-agnostic AppImage, as binary software deployment for the Linux users of the various Linux distributions turned out to be problematic. MuseScore started in April 2016 to use AppImage builds for software deployment for all Linux flavors. Krita, a digital painting free and open-source software application, is also deployed using AppImage from version 3.0 in May 2016. digiKam, an open source photo management application, also includes an AppImage bundle from version 5.3.0, released in November 2016. Network World's Bryan Lunduke noted on March 31, 2017 positively the Linux distribution- agnostic packaging of OpenShot with AppImage. LMMS, an open source digital audio workstation, started distributing for Linux as an AppImage since version 1.2.0-RC5. KeePassXC is also using AppImage for Linux binary distributions. Neo4j uses AppImage for the Linux version of their \\"Neo4j Desktop\\" program. RPCS3, the most used PS3 emulator, for Linux is distributed through AppImage. GitHub desktop client app Linux version maintained by the community is distributed with an AppImage option. Iris, the computer-monitor eye-strain reduction and management software, offers a paid AppImage option. FreeCAD, an open-source parametric 3D modeler, uses AppImage as the primary Linux binary download. OpenSCAD, another open-source parametric 3D modeler, also uses AppImage as a Linux binary download option.

Applications included games, the programming language Logo, news/current events, and rudimentary PC banking/shopping. At its peak, approximately 100 applications were available. The NABU Network can be credited as being the first online version of fantasy baseball. The Game, aptly named Managers Baseball, allowed for choosing teams based on the real names and statistics of MLB teams and players. Player performance in the game was based on real life player statistics and as a Manager you would draft your team and compete against another owner in a mock up game in a purely managerial role. The NABU Network PC cost $950 CAD, approximately the same price as the wildly successful Commodore 64 at the time, and the network service cost $8 to $10 per month.  Hardware  The heart of a NABU (which stands for Natural Access to Bi-directional Utilities) PC was the Z80A processor chip (running at a then lightning-fast 3.57 MHz) and the cutting-edge TI 9918 video chip, which was able to produce some very good graphics for its time. All this was served up via a Gould SEL mainframe. The logic module included four socketed chips: a TR1865CL-04, a full-duplex UART, an SC87253P 8-bit microprocessor, an N8X60N FIFO I/O controller and a pre- programmed ROM. The remainder of the parts on the board were numerous 74LS series logic ICs. There was an RF module that down-converted signals from the cable connection and up-converted requests to be sent to the server. There were four circuit boards for frequency synthesis, data in and out and RF conversion and dual helical coil bandpass filters. Download speeds over the cable TV line were up to 6.4 Mbit/second. By default, the PCs lacked any individual offline storage, but an optional hard drive could be purchased.  Business success  The NABU service first became available in 1983 through Ottawa Cablevision and Skyline Cablevision, through the efforts of John Kelly and Bruce Hempell. The project was heavily subsidized by the Canadian government. A major weakness of the Ottawa network was the strictly one-way connection as it was implemented on Ottawa Cablevision. The NABU system itself was bi-directional, but most cable networks of that era did not support this feature due to the cost required for a bidirectional cable infrastructure ‚Äî a \\"chicken and egg\\" problem that limited NABU's market potential. Campeau Corporation was a major investor in NABU but pulled out in 1984. Another network was started in Japan. However, NABU never achieved commercial success and ceased operation in 1985.

As the source is directional, the sound pressure as a function of distance between source and sampling point (listener) varies with their relative position, so that for a particular room and source the set of points where direct and reverberant sound pressure are equal constitutes a surface rather than a distinguished location in the room. In other words, it is the point in space at which the combined amplitude of all the reflected echoes are the same as the amplitude of the sound coming directly from the source (D = R). This distance, called the critical distance d_c, is dependent on the geometry and absorption of the space in which the sound waves propagate, as well as the dimensions and shape of the sound source. A reverberant room generates a short critical distance and an acoustically dead (anechoic) room generates a longer critical distance.

Prior to her involvement in anime, she had some on-screen acting roles in films and television including Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and other media produced by Sam Raimi. Some of her major voice roles are title characters such as Belldandy in Ah! My Goddess: The Movie, Mizuho Kazami in Please Teacher!, Mima Kirigoe in Perfect Blue, and Lain Iwakura in Serial Experiments Lain. She also voiced lead ensemble characters as Rune Venus in El Hazard, Miaka Yuki in Fushigi Y√ªgi, Raquel Casull in Scrapped Princess, Fuu Hououji in Magic Knight Rayearth, Shinobu Maehara in Love Hina, Nia Teppelin in Gurren Lagann, and Irisviel von Einzbern in Fate/Zero. She served as the ADR director for the Fushigi Y√ªgi series and films, Ah! My Goddess: The Movie and a series of shorts called The Adventures of Mini-Goddess. She also provides background voices in a number of animated films recorded in the Los Angeles area, including Frozen, Epic, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. In video games, she provides the voice of KOS-MOS in the Xenosaga series as well as Atoli in the .hack//G.U. series. Career Hoffman grew up in the Detroit area and graduated from Michigan State. She was a model for the promotional pictures of Sam Raimi's 1981 film The Evil Dead, and has participated in several Josh Becker-directed films and episodes, including Running Time, Cleveland Smith: Bounty Hunter as well as small roles in Raimi's films Crimewave and Darkman. While in Los Angeles, she worked as an actress on a number of plays and also a narrator model for some auto shows. She starred alongside Ned Beatty as a historian who time travels with a group of scientists in the 1989 film Time Trackers. She had a starring guest role as Echidna, the Mother of all Monsters, in Raimi's television show Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, and would make other appearances in the series. Hoffman has been involved in voiceovers for anime titles. Many of her roles have been under an alias such as Ruby Marlowe, which was her character's name in her 1994 film Double Exposure. She worked with Animaze / Pioneer Entertainment on the Fushigi Yugi: The Mysterious Play anime series, where she served as the voice director as well as voice the starring role of Miaka Yuki; the show, along with another Pioneer production El-Hazard, where she voices Rune Venus, would air regularly on the International Channel. Her voice was not warmly received by critics on Anime News Network who disliked her squealing schoolgirl tone, and high pitch, although Mike Dungan of Mania.com find her direction and acting to be entertaining. She starred as Mima Kirigoe in Perfect Blue, a psychological horror film by Satoshi Kon about a former Japanese idol who tries her hand at acting, but whose life falls apart when she is stalked by an obsessed fan and her associates are murdered one by one. Carlos Ross of THEM Anime Reviews considered the general dub acting as \\"sophisticated, subtle, and well-done\\", while Chris Homer of Fandom Post enjoyed both the English and the Japanese versions. On the DVD extra for the film, Hoffman gave a Q&A; about her character. She would also voice title character Lain Iwakura in Serial Experiments Lain; she plays a teenager who is deeply involved in the computer network world. Aaron Silver of Anime News Network thought the dubbing was decent but her role as Lain lacked some emotion in comparison with her Japanese voice counterpart. With the studio Bang Zoom! Entertainment she voiced Fuu Hououji in Magic Knight Rayearth, which was about a trio of junior high students who are transported to a fantasy world. Both Rayearth seasons were dubbed into English. In 2001, she worked with Pioneer (now part of Geneon Entertainment) to ADR direct Ah! My Goddess: The Movie, a feature film in the Oh My Goddess franchise in which she also voiced the title character Belldandy. In a review of the movie, Karen Gellender of Mania.com, who was impressed by Hoffman's previous performances as Mima and Lain, thought the dubbing was a mixed bag, and that her portrayal of Belldandy was the weakest of the bunch, with rather forced acting of emotional dialogue. In contrast, Allen Divers of Anime News Network thought the English cast was suitable and comparable to the Japanese version. Hoffman would later reprise the role of Belldandy in a series of anime shorts called The Adventures of Mini-Goddess, where she also served as its ADR script writer and the ADR director. She would also have a title role as Mizuho Kazami in Please Teacher, in which she portrays a teacher who marries her student and is actually a space alien, and a title role as Mahoro Andou in Mahoromatic: Automatic Maiden, where she plays an android maid. She also became married to Rif Hutton in 2001.Rif Hutton Biography, Film Reference In the fantasy adventure Scrapped Princess, Hoffman plays Raquel Casull, the older sister of the title character. Theron Martin of Anime News Network describes her character as initially ditzy but becomes sensible and coldly pragmatic, and that her voice was a particularly good fit, and a dead-on portrayal. Hoffman would voice high school student Shinobu Maehara in the Love Hina romantic comedy series, and supporting character Ryoko Asakura in Bang Zoom!'s dubbing of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya series. She had recurring roles in the related anime series Lucky Star where she plays Inori Hiiragi, the eldest sister of the Hiiragi family, and Yukari Takara who is Miyuki's mother. Hoffman would continue voice acting in the 2010s. In 2013, she voiced Irisviel von Einzbern in Fate/Zero, a prequel to the Fate/stay night series. Outside of anime productions, Hoffman has been involved in a number of animated films, including Frozen and Tangled, where she participates in background voices (ADR loop groups or Additional Voices). In 2012, she was a panelist in the SAG Foundation's Voice-Over Summit held in the Los Angeles area where she discussed ADR, Voice Matching, and Voice Replacement. She voices in video game series, including .hack//G.U. where she voices Atoli, and Xenosaga where she voices KOS-MOS in Xenosaga Episode III: Also sprach Zarathustra. She also continues to act in local theatre productions.

All are now extinct. They were long classified in Struthioniformes, but are now usually classified as galloanseres.Murray, P. F. & Megirian, D. (1998)Murray, P. F. & Vickers-Rich, P. (2004) Dromornithids were part of the Australian megafauna. One species, Dromornis stirtoni, was tall. The collective term Australian megafauna is used to describe a number of comparatively large species of animals that lived in Australia until 50,000 to 20,000 years ago. The causes for the disappearance of these animals are under dispute, though hunting by humans has been identified as a potential instigator.Miller, G. H. et al. (1999)Roberts, R. G. et al. (2001) It is also not clear to what degree dromornithids were carnivores. The massive, crushing beaks of some species suggest that at least some members of the family were either a combination of carnivorous predators and scavengers or omnivores. Other features, such as the \\"hoof-like\\" feet, stomach structure, and eye structure that resulted in a wide field of vision, but likely also created a centre blind spot of about 40 degrees (which would hinder hunting significantly), suggest a more herbivorous, migratory lifestyle. The current consensus is that they were, indeed, herbivores.Gerald Mayr, Paleogene Fossil Birds, 2009 The scientific name Dromornithidae derives from the Greek words , (\\"swift-running\\") and , (\\"bird\\"). Additionally, the family has been called thunder birds, giant emus, giant runners, demon ducks and mihirungs.Mihirung paringmal is an Aboriginal word from the Tjapwuring people of western Victoria that means 'giant bird'. Classification What the nearest relatives of this group are is a controversial issue. For many years it was thought that dromornithids were related to ratites, such as emus, cassowaries, rheas and ostriches. It is now believed that the similarities between these groups are the result of similar responses to the loss of flight. The latest idea on dromornithid relationships, based on details of the skull, is that they evolved early in the lineage that includes waterfowl (Anseriformes). However, some phylogenetic studies have recovered them as closer to gamefowl (Galliformes). Below is the general consensus of the phylogeny under the hypothesis that they are members of Anserimorphae. A 2017 paper concerning the evolution and phylogeny of the giant fowl by Worthy and colleagues have found phylogenetic support in finding the mihirungs to be the sister taxon to Gastornithidae. Worthy et al. (2017) incorporated several new taxa and character traits into existing matrices of Galloanserae resulted in several of their phylogenies to support this grouping. The authors did note the bootstrap support is weakly supported and one of their phylogenies even found gastornithiforms to be stem galliforms instead. These were also weakly supported. Below is a simplified phylogeny showing their one phylogeny supporting gastornithiforms as anserimorphs. =Species= There are seven known species in the Dromornithidae,Rich, P. (1979) the smallest species was Barawertornis tedfordi, a bird about the size of a modern cassowary, weighing . The two species of Ilbandornis (Ilbandornis lawsoni and Ilbandornis woodburnei) were larger birds, but had more slender legs than the other dromornithids and were similar to ostriches in their build and size. Bullockornis planei (the \\"demon duck of doom\\") and Genyornis newtoni (the \\"mihirung\\") were more heavily built, stood about tall and probably reached weights of . The largest dromornithids were Dromornis australis, from which the family gets its name, and the massive Dromornis stirtoni (\\"Stirton's thunderbird\\"). Genyornis is the best known of the genera. Description and biology Artist's reconstruction of Genyornis newtoni. Artist's reconstruction of Dromornis stirtoni. Dromornithids looked superficially like very large emus or moa. Most were heavy-bodied, with powerfully developed legs and greatly reduced wings. The last bones of the toes resembled small hooves, rather than claws as in most birds. Like emus and other flightless birds, dromornithids lost the keel on the breastbone (or sternum) that serves as the attachment for the large flight muscles in most bird skeletons. Their skull also was quite different from that of emus. These birds ranged from about the size of a modern cassowary up to in the case of Dromornis stirtoni, possibly the largest bird that ever lived after the elephant bird (Vorombe). =Diet= It has been generally thought that the dromornithids were plant eaters, a belief currently considered common scientific consensus.Peter F. Murray,Patricia Vickers-Rich, Magnificent Mihirungs: The Colossal Flightless Birds of the Australian Dreamtime This belief is based on: * the lack of a hook at the end of the bill * the lack of talons on the toes * the association of gizzard stones (caveat: gastroliths are also found in the stomachs of some carnivores, such as modern crocodiles) * the large number of individuals occurring together, suggesting flocking behaviour The very large skull and deep bill of Bullockornis, however, are very unlike those found in large herbivorous birds such as moa. If this dromornithid ate plants, it was equipped to process very robust material that has thus far not been identified. Growing and maintaining such a large head would be detrimental and probably not occur unless it provided a substantial benefit of some sort, although it may have just been a social signal. However, it would require a highly developed or complex social structure to evolve. It has been suggested that, despite the indications of herbivory in some dromornithids, Bullockornis may have been a carnivore or possibly a scavenger. However, most authorities now consider it to be a herbivore. =Locomotion= Because of their enormous size, dromornithids have been considered to have been slow, lumbering creatures. Their legs are not long and slender like those of emus or ostriches, which are specialised for running. However, biomechanical analysis of the attachments and presumed sizes of the muscles suggest that dromornithids might have been able to run much faster than originally thought, making up for their less than ideal form with brute strength. =Sexual dimorphism= At least Dromornis shows evidence of sexual dimorphism. Males were more robust and heavier than females, though not necessarily taller.Sexual dimorphism in the late Miocene mihirung Dromornis stirtoni (Aves: Dromornithidae) from the Alcoota Local Fauna of central Australia, DOI:10.1080/02724634.2016.1180298, Received: 9 Jul 2015 Accepted: 20 Feb 2015 Published online: 07 Jun 2016 Distribution Records of these birds are known only from Australia. Most of the records of dromornithids come from the eastern half of the continent, although fossil evidence has also been discovered in Tasmania and Western Australia. At some Northern Territory sites they are very common, sometimes comprising 60-70% of the fossil material. A fragment of a dromornithid-sized foot bone has been found in Antarctica, but whether it represents these birds is uncertain. The earliest bones identified were found in Late Oligocene deposits at Riversleigh in northwestern Queensland. There are foot impressions from the Early Eocene in southeastern Queensland that may be referable to dromornithids. The most recent evidence, of Genyornis newtoni, has been found at Cuddie Springs in north-central New South Wales and dated at 31,000 years old.Field, J. H. & Boles, W. E. (1998) Extinction The reasons for the extinction of this entire family along with the rest of the Australian megafauna by the end of the Pleistocene are still debated. It is hypothesized that the arrival of the first humans in Australia (around 48-60 thousand years ago) and their hunting and landscape-changing use of fire may have contributed to the disappearance of the megafauna. However, drought conditions during peak glaciation (about 18,000 years ago) are a significantly confounding factor. Recent studiesRoberts et al. 2001 appear to rule this out as the primary cause of extinction, but there is also some dispute about these studies.Wroe et al. 2002 It is likely that a combination of all of these factors contributed to the megafauna's demise. However, there is significant disagreement about the relative importance of each. Discovery The most recent species, Genyornis newtoni, was certainly known to Aborigines during the Late Pleistocene. Cave paintings thought to depict this bird are known, as are carved footprints larger than those considered to represent emus. At Cuddie Springs, Genyornis bones have been excavated in association with human artifacts. The issue of how much of an impact humans had on dromornithids and other large animals of the time is unresolved and much debated. Many scientists believe that human settlement and hunting were largely responsible for the extinction of many species of the Australian megafauna. The first Europeans to encounter the bones of dromornithids may have been Thomas Mitchell and his team. While exploring the Wellington Caves, one of his men tied his rope to a projecting object which broke when he tried to descend the rope. After the man had climbed back up, it was found that the projecting object was the fossilised long bone of a large bird. The first species to be described was Dromornis australis. The specimen was found in a 55-metre deep well at Peak Downs, Queensland, and subsequently described by Richard Owen in 1872. Extensive collections of any dromornithid fossils were first made at Lake Callabonna, South Australia. In 1892, E. C. Stirling and A. H. C. Zietz of the South Australian Museum received reports of large bones in a dry lake bed in the northwest of the state. Over the several next years, they made several trips to the site, collecting nearly complete skeletons of several individuals. They named the newly found species Genyornis newtoni in 1896. Additional remains of Genyornis have been found in other parts of South Australia and in New South Wales and Victoria. Other sites of importance were Bullock Creek and Alcoota, both in the Northern Territory. The specimen recovered there remained unstudied and unnamed until 1979, when Patricia Rich described five new species and four new genera. The best represented bones of dromornithids are vertebrae, long bones of the hindlimb and toe bones. Ribs and wing bones are uncommonly preserved. The rarest part of the skeleton is the skull. For many years, the only skull known was a damaged specimen of Genyornis. Early reconstructions of dromornithids made them appear like oversized emus. Peter Murray and Dirk Megirian of Australia's Northern Territory Museum recovered enough skull material of Bullockornis to give a good idea of what that bird's head looked like. It is now known that the Bullockornis skull was very large, with the enormous bill making up about two- thirds of it. The bill was deep, but rather narrow. The jaws had cutting edges at the front, as well as crushing surfaces at the back. There were attachments for large muscles, indicating that Bullockornis had a powerful bite. More fragmentary remains of the skull of Dromornis suggest that it, too, had an oversized skull. Bones are not the only remains of dromornithids that have been found: *The polished stones that the birds kept in their gizzards (muscular stomachs) occur at a number of sites. These stones, called gastroliths, played an important role in their digestion by breaking up coarse food or matter that was swallowed in large chunks. *Series of footprints, called trackways, have been found at several sites.Vickers-Rich, P. & Molnar, R. E. (1996)Rich, P. & Gill, E. (1976)Rich, P. & Green, R. H. (1974) *Impressions of the inside of the skull cavity (endocranial casts or endocasts) have been found. Endocasts are formed when sediments fill the empty skull, after which the skull is destroyed. These fossils give a fairly accurate picture of dromornithid brains.

It was founded as the Marxist-Leninist Rotterdam Group (Groep Rotterdam marxistisch-leninistisch in March 1972 by a group of dissidents from the Communist Unity Movement of the Netherlands (marxist-leninist) (KEN (ml)), following the departure of the 'Proletarian' wing of the KEN (ml) in October 1971. (This proletarian wing would later evolve into the Socialist Party.) The Groep Rotterdam rapidly changed its name to Communists Circle of Rijnmond (marxist-leninist) (Kommunisten Kring Rijnmond (marxistisch-leninistisch), abbreviated KKR (ml)). According to a Dutch internal security service (BVD) estimate the KKR (ml) had 17 members in 1972. In 1974 KKR (ml) renamed itself to the Communist Organisation of Rotterdam and Surroundings (marxist-leninist) (Kommunistische Organisatie Rotterdam en Omstreken (marxistisch-leninistisch), abbreviated KORO (ml)). The following year the name of the organization was changed once again, now to KAO. The shift from KORO (ml) to KAO marked, in the understanding of the group itself, a step from being a local organisation to a national party-building one. The same year, the KAO was engaged in unity talks held amongst the Dutch fringe left. This included the KEN (ml), the organisation of which the KAO was a split, as well as several other organisations that had split from the KEN (ml): *the Group of Marxist- Leninists/Red Dawn (GML), *the Communist Circle of Breda (marxist-leninist) (KKB (ml)) *the League of Dutch Marxist-Leninists (BNML). Excluded from these talks were the Socialist Party (that had moved away from the Maoist orthodoxy), Red Youth (which had developed a terroristic orientation) and the Marxist-Leninist Party of the Netherlands (a BVD proxy). GML excluded itself from the process due to their rejection of unity with KEN (ml), and KEN (ml) could not arrive at a comprise with the other groups due to their persistence on claiming hegemony over the other factions. In 1978 KAO merged with the two remaining factions, the BNML and KKB (ml) to form the Communist Workers Organisation (marxist-leninist) (KAO (ml)).  Literature  * Harmsen, G.

It was formed around 165 million years ago, in a shallow, warm sea on the margin of the London Platform and has estuarine beds above and below it. The maximum known thickness is 40.2 metres, at around TF9730, while four kilometres further west it is 18.3 metres thick at its outcrop in the upper Witham valley. It fades out in the south, around Kettering in Northamptonshire. There are two sub-divisions, the Upper and Lower Lincolnshire Limestone Members respectively. The dividing marker is the 'Crossi' bed which is distinguished by the fossils of Acanthothris crossi it contains. The Crossi bed forms the top of the Lower Lincolnshire limestone. The bottom of the Lower Lincolnshire limestone has some of the characteristics of the underlying Lower Estuarine Series, in that it tends to contain more than usual amounts of sand. A stone from this part of the formation which was commercially exploited is the Collyweston stone slate which was used for roofing for several centuries. It is now largely replaced in new work by concrete imitations. Much of the rest of the Lower Lincolnshire limestone is oolitic. It formed in warm, shallow seas where evaporation concentrated the dissolved calcium carbonate and wave action rolled the precipitated material into tiny balls.

Littlefield (born 1946) is an American politician and the former mayor of Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was elected via a run-off election in 2005 after a long term as a city councilman.\\"Our Town Chattanooga Then and Now Part Six: An Amazing Transformation for The Most Polluted City\\", Nordia Epps, WDEF- TV, May 16, 2007 He was reelected in 2009. He is the former executive director of Chattanooga Venture.http://www.chattanooga.gov/Mayors_Office/MayorsOffice_BiographyofMayorLittlefield.htm Career Littlefield began his professional career as a city planner with the Tennessee State Planning Commission in 1970 working with suburban cities and counties around Chattanooga. His early efforts led to the adoption of Tennessee \\"Scenic Routes\\" legislation in 1971 and to some of the first environmental regulations and controls limiting signs and billboards. In the early 1970s, he worked for Research Triangle Institute under a contract with the then new US Environmental Protection Agency on studies of the health effects of air pollution in Chattanooga. In 1978 he became a charter member of the American Institute of Certified Planners. He later served as director of economic development for the City of Chattanooga ‚Äì a position that ultimately led to his heading a joint economic development operation for the surrounding Hamilton County and the Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce. In 1982, he was selected to head Chattanooga Venture ‚Äì a special purpose nonprofit organization aimed at transforming Chattanooga. At Venture he oversaw the production of Vision 2000 ‚Äì one of the first comprehensive \\"Visioning\\" projects in the United States ‚Äì which ultimately involved dozens of meetings and approximately 3000 local citizens. this effort is frequently cited as the turning point that led to Chattanooga's transformation. In 1986, he left Chattanooga Venture to run for local political office. In 1987, he was elected Commissioner of Public Works under the old commission form of government that was in place in Chattanooga at that time. In that office, he led an effort to reform the local government by abandoning the commission form and adopting a more modern strong mayor / council form with legislative representatives selected from single member districts. After drafting a new charter and a failed referendum to adopt that charter, the Federal Courts got involved and ordered the change to become effective in 1990. At that time, Littlefield ran for and was elected to the first city council and was further selected as the council's first chairman. Littlefield served through the first council term and then ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1993. After several years working in the private sector and as a planning consultant for other governments, Littlefield ran successfully for his old position on the Chattanooga City Council and once again was chosen as chairman. He served out that term on the council until mounting a second and this time successful campaign for mayor in 2001 ‚Äì following Bob Corker, who left after one term to run for the US Senate.

On September 7, 2010, the recall attempt was halted in a ruling by Hamilton County Circuit Judge Jeff Hollingsworth, who cited the recall groups' failure to comply with state law on a variety of issues related to the petition language, number of dated signatures, the use of petitions not approved by the election commission and other legal and organizational missteps made by the three groups involved.

He later held office as Governor of New South Wales from 1981 to 1989, and was Chancellor of the University of Sydney from 1990 to 1991. Born in rural New South Wales, Rowland cut short his aeronautical engineering studies at the University of Sydney to join the RAAF in 1942. He was posted to Britain and served as a bomber pilot with the Pathfinders in the air war over Europe, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1944. The following year he was forced to bail out over Germany following a collision with another Allied aircraft, and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner. After repatriation and demobilisation, Rowland gained his engineering degree and rejoined the RAAF. He became a test pilot, serving with and later commanding the Aircraft Research and Development Unit in the 1950s, and also a senior engineering officer, being closely involved in preparations for delivery to Australia of the Dassault Mirage III supersonic fighter in the 1960s. In 1972 he was promoted to air vice marshal and became Air Member for Technical Services, holding this post until his elevation to air marshal and appointment as CAS in March 1975. He was the first engineering officer to lead the RAAF, and the first man to personally command it in a legal sense, following abolition of the Australian Air Board in 1976. Knighted in 1977, Rowland retired from the Air Force in 1979 and became Governor of New South Wales in January 1981. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1987. Retiring from the Governorship in 1989, he held a place on several boards as well as the Chancellorship of the University of Sydney. Early life and World War II alt=Rear three-quarter view of four-engined military aircraft with twin tailfins, parked on landing ground Rowland was born in Armidale, New South Wales, on 1 November 1922.Stephens; Isaacs, High Fliers, pp. 158‚Äì161 He was the son of Louis Rowland, a commander in the Royal Australian Navy, and his wife Elsie.Draper, Who's Who in Australia 1985, p. 741 Jim evinced a fascination with aviation from an early age, carving model aeroplanes out of wood. Growing up with his three brothers on the family's rural property, he was schooled via correspondence before completing his secondary education at Cranbrook, Sydney.Williams, \\"Sir James Anthony Rowland\\", p. 571 Rowland entered the University of Sydney to study aeronautical engineering, but left in May 1942 to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a pilot under the Empire Air Training Scheme.Dennis et al., The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, pp. 455‚Äì456 In early 1943 he underwent service flying training in Canada.Rees, Lancaster Men, p. 17 He was commissioned as a pilot officer in July and posted to Britain, where he converted to Handley Page Halifax and Avro Lancaster heavy bombers. Rowland was assigned to the Pathfinder Force that marked targets for other aircraft on strategic bombing missions over Europe. Considered an exceptional pilot, he became a master bomber with No. 635 Squadron RAF in 1944. As a master bomber, his role was to arrive ahead of the main Allied force, check that flares marking the target were in place, and warn his fellows if they were bombing inaccurately.Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\" No. 635 Squadron operated Lancasters, a type that, Rowland recalled, \\"would forgive sprog pilots doing the most outrageous things to it, and would even bring them home with quite large bits shot off it\\".Brown, Skylarks, p. vii Having been promoted to acting flight lieutenant, Rowland was on a sortie to attack D√ºsseldorf in December 1944 when he lost one of his engines. He nevertheless continued on to the target where, owing to his lower- than-normal altitude, his aircraft was seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire before and after he dropped his bombs. Nursing his plane back to base, he was recommended for the Distinguished Flying Cross in recognition of his \\"great determination and devotion to duty\\"; the award was promulgated in the London Gazette on 16 February 1945. In January 1945, Rowland's Lancaster collided with a Canadian bomber over Frankfurt, and he had to bail out with his surviving crew. Captured and held by the Gestapo in solitary confinement, he was scheduled to be executed but was saved by two Luftwaffe officers who had learned of his situation. They took him to a prisoner-of-war camp, where he remained until being repatriated at the end of hostilities. None of Rowland's crew survived the war and, though he believed he had done all he could to save them, he suffered survivor guilt.Rees, Lancaster Men, p. 381 Post-war RAAF career Rowland (right) on his visit to alt=Two men crouching opposite each other, one in flying gear and the other in light-coloured uniform with forage cap Rowland's commission was terminated in November 1945. Returning to Australia, he resumed his studies at the University of Sydney and completed his degree, before rejoining the RAAF as a member of its newly formed Technical Branch in 1947. He was posted to Britain in 1949 to attend the Empire Test Pilots' School. In 1952, he was appointed chief test pilot with the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) at RAAF Base Laverton, Victoria. Rowland led trial programs that involved many of the Air Force's early jets such as the Gloster Meteor, de Havilland Vampire, English Electric Canberra, and CAC Sabre. Promoted to squadron leader, he earned the Air Force Cross for his test flying achievements; the award was gazetted on 1 January 1955. He married Faye Doughton on 20 April 1955; the couple had a daughter, Anni. Rowland attended RAAF Staff College, Point Cook, in 1956. Promoted to wing commander, he took charge of ARDU from November 1956 until June 1959.RAAF Historical Section, Ancillary Units, pp. 158‚Äì161 In 1957, he raised concerns that the supersonic Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, touted as a multi-role replacement for the Sabre, was ill-suited for any purpose except interception. The Defence Minister, Sir Philip McBride, had reached a similar conclusion and kept the Sabre in frontline service until a more suitable aircraft could be chosen, namely the Dassault Mirage III delta-wing fighter.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 354‚Äì357 From 1961 to 1964 Rowland was based in Paris, as Technical Staff Officer on the RAAF team preparing for the Mirage's acceptance into Australian service. In contrast to most of the team members, he displayed a talent for language and by his second year was chairing meetings in French with Dassault engineers.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 12 After returning to Australia, he was posted to the Directorate of Aircraft Engineering at the Department of Air, Canberra, responsible for ongoing technical oversight of the Mirage. alt=Single-engined, delta-wing military jet in a hangar In December 1966, Rowland became commanding officer of No. 3 Aircraft Depot (No. 3 AD) at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, with the acting rank of group captain; his promotion was made substantive in November 1967. After completing his tenure at No. 3 AD in January 1969, Rowland was appointed Senior Engineering Staff Officer at Headquarters Operational Command in Glenbrook, New South Wales.RAAF Historical Section, Maintenance Units, pp. 10‚Äì12 In 1971 he was posted to Britain to attend the Royal College of Defence Studies, London. Returning to Australia, he was Director-General of Aircraft Engineering before being promoted to air vice marshal to serve as Air Member for Technical Services (AMTS), the RAAF's senior engineering position, in November 1972. The AMTS occupied a seat on the Australian Air Board, the service's controlling body that was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS).Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 75‚Äì76, 174‚Äì179 In March 1975, Rowland was raised to air marshal and took over from Air Marshal Charles Read as CAS, becoming the first appointee to the position who had joined the RAAF after the commencement of World War II. He was also the first engineering officer to lead the RAAF, and was selected over a more senior air vice marshal through the personal influence of the Defence Secretary, Sir Arthur Tange.McNamara, The Quiet Man, p. 169 The CAS was nevertheless required to be a member of the Air Force's aircrew stream so Rowland, still a qualified pilot, had to transfer from the Technical Branch to the General Duties Branch. Soon afterwards, the stipulation for the CAS to be a member of the General Duties Branch was removed.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 296‚Äì297 In 1976, Rowland became the first CAS to personally command the RAAF in a legal sense, following dissolution of the Air Board, a consequence of defence reorganisation in the wake of the 1973 \\"Tange report\\" that recommended departmental rationalisation. A new Chief of the Air Staff Advisory Committee (CASAC) was set up, but there was no requirement for the CAS to accept its advice.Odgers, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 188 According to historian Alan Stephens, Rowland considered that the \\"collective wisdom\\" engendered by the Air Board had been generally beneficial to the RAAF, and believed the new arrangements led to paralysis and arrogation of decision making', and empire building in the Public Service component\\".Stephens, Going Solo, p. 80Stephens, Australia's Air Chiefs, p. 11 Though known as a strong committee member who enjoyed a good argument, he \\"found that the sheer time involved in attending meetings made it very difficult for him to run the Air Force 'the way [he] wanted to. To facilitate the cross-fertilisation of ideas on air power between senior officers, he inaugurated an annual CAS Symposium.Pickard, Air Power Doctrine Education, p. 4 During his term as CAS, Rowland reoriented the RAAF's priorities in line with the Defence of Australia policy, which had been adopted by the government in the early 1970s. As a result, he placed the strongest emphasis on protecting Australia from air attack, followed by conducting air strikes on targets in other countries, and supporting the Army and Navy.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, pp. 118‚Äì119 On 11 June 1977, Rowland was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the military division. In July the same year, he was awarded the National Medal with First Clasp, given \\"for diligent long service to the community\\". Rowland's original three-year tenure as CAS was extended by a year. He retired from the Air Force in March 1979, and was succeeded by his deputy and former classmate at RAAF Staff College, Air Vice Marshal Neville McNamara.McNamara, The Quiet Man, pp. 106, 182‚Äì183 Governorship and later life After leaving the Air Force, Rowland continued to live in Canberra, consulting part-time for French arms concern Ofema. In late 1980 he was recommended by the government of Premier Neville Wran to serve as the next Governor of New South Wales, replacing Sir Roden Cutler. Rowland admitted that he did not have \\"the faintest idea\\" why he was chosen, and thought that \\"there must be a lot of people who could do it a lot better than I could\\". He saw the role as the monarch's representative in New South Wales as helping to provide \\"a valuable link with an older part of the world\\". Wran, for his part, was understood to have chosen Rowland largely on the basis of his engaging personality; it was also said that the Premier preferred military men for vice-regal office because \\"they knew how to take orders\\".Williams, \\"Sir James Anthony Rowland\\", p. 569 Rowland was duly appointed by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 January 1981. Upon taking office, he declared that he wished to be seen as a \\"man of the people\\". To this end, he opened Government House to the public on a more frequent basis, and also extended invitations for official functions to a broader range of society than was previously the case. As Governor of New South Wales and therefore the senior state governor, Rowland held a dormant commission to serve as Administrator of the Commonwealth and Commander-in- Chief of the Australian Defence Force during absences by the Governor General, and did so six times while in office.Stephens, Australia's Air Chiefs, p. 32Coulthard-Clark, Soldiers in Politics, p. 60 On one such occasion he was required to dismiss an old colleague, Air Vice Marshal James Flemming, from his position as director of the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, after the Government lost faith in Flemming's ability to properly manage the Memorial. Rowland had served as one of Flemming's referees when he applied to head the Memorial in 1982.McKernan, Here Is Their Spirit, pp. 341‚Äì342 The journalist and public servant Evan Williams also credited Rowland with being \\"the first Viceregal whistleblower\\" for alerting the Wran government to an unusual number of early release requests for prisoners that he was being asked to sign by Corrective Services Minister Rex Jackson. The inquiries set in motion by Rowland's queries revealed that Jackson was receiving money from criminals for misusing the early release scheme. Forced to resign, Jackson was later charged with corruption and imprisoned.Williams, \\"Sir James Anthony Rowland\\", pp. xviii, 570‚Äì571 Rowland was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Engineering by the University of Sydney in 1983, and also appointed a Knight of the Order of St John. He was Honorary Air Commodore of No. 22 Squadron from 1981 to 1989, and Honorary Colonel of the Royal New South Wales Regiment from 1985 to 1989. On 26 January 1987, he was invested as a Companion of the Order of Australia for \\"service to the Crown and to the people of New South Wales\\". At Sydney Town Hall on 3 October that year, he took the salute of Vietnam veterans during their official \\"Welcome Home March\\".Korbl, Ex-Luftwaffe MBE, p. 130 His governorship coincided with Australian Bicentenary celebrations in 1988.Williams, \\"Sir James Anthony Rowland\\", p. 575 A popular Governor, Rowland was considered by his Labor premiers to be \\"a safe pair of hands\\".Williams, \\"Sir James Anthony Rowland\\", pp. 576‚Äì577 His original four-year term was extended twice, each time for two years, by the Wran and Unsworth administrations. On 27 April 1988, Rowland opened the Forty-Ninth New South Wales Parliament with a new premier, Nick Greiner, whose Liberal Party had defeated Labor in the March elections. That November, he took a turn at flying one of the RAAF's recently acquired F/A-18 Hornets piloted by Wing Commander (later Air Vice Marshal) John Kindler.Williams, \\"Sir James Anthony Rowland\\", p. 573 He was succeeded on 20 January 1989 by Rear Admiral Sir David Martin. After retiring from the Governorship, Rowland served as President of the Royal Humane Society, Chancellor of the University of Sydney from 1990 to 1991, and as a member of the Police Board from 1989 to 1992. He was also a member of the boards of several private companies, including Angus & Coote and Thomson-CSF Pacific Holdings, and Chairman of the Aerospace Foundation of Australia from 1992 until his death in Sydney on 27 May 1999. Sir James Rowland was survived by his wife and daughter, and accorded a state funeral. In 2016, the RAAF Air Power Development Centre and the Australian Centre for the Study of Armed Conflict and Society at the University of New South Wales jointly established the Sir James Rowland Air Power Seminar to further \\"a broadened understanding of the origins, evolution, application and depiction of air power in the national interest\\".
