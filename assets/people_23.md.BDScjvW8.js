It was telecast at 10pm on Saturday (and later on Sundays and Fridays) on NBC from April 1949 to 1954.Video file downloads-The Best of Garroway at Large Garroway at Large aired with a full symphony orchestra conducted by Joseph Gallicchio. There were two female singers, Betty Chapel and Connie Russell and a male singer, Jack Haskell. In addition, the Hamilton Trio, a contemporary dance group, appeared each week, along with comedian Cliff Norton. The show had only one local Chicago broadcast on April 8, 1949 before becoming an NBC Network program. The series is notable for introducing an innovative presentation and staging to television. When television began in New York City, the shows adopted the familiar theatrical proscenium concept, separating the stage from the audience area. After World War II, several programs originated from Chicago, where Garroway was a disc jockey on radio station WMAQ. When Garroway was assigned to host on television, he abandoned the usual conventions for a more casual approach in which the reality of the studio was acknowledged. Followed by a single camera, he walked around the entire large studio space and simple abstract sets as he talked to guests and the TV viewer directly. This live staging technique, known as the \\"Chicago Style\\", was developed further on Garroway's next show, Today.

The name of the club was derived from the fact that from 1911 to 1919 the club met at the no longer extant Joseph Reynolds' Tavern in the west end of the Caleb Wescott House in Kingston. The club was first registered as a corporation with the Secretary of State of Rhode Island on 23 March 1914 with its charter president, Robert A.

Watercolor by David Davidson ca1910. The Tavern Hall Club purchased the Elisha Reynolds House in 1919 to serve as its meetinghouse, located at 1800 South Road on the corner of Kingstown Road (Route 138). Over the years in addition to being the home of Col. Elisha Reynolds, the house served as the home of Elisha Reynolds Potter (1764–1835), Reynolds's grandson, who served as the Speaker of the Rhode Island House of Representatives and became a U.S. Congressman. It was also one of several homes owned by Potter's son Elisha Reynolds Potter, Jr. (1811–1882) who was a Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, and also a U.S. Congressman like his father. During the Revolution, the house was used as a meeting place for the 3rd Kings County Regiment of the Rhode Island militia (known as the Kingston Reds), that was formed in May 1779 under the command of Col. Thomas Potter. On 5 March 1781, Col. Potter served as host of General George Washington and his officers in the house on a final stop on their famed journey to confer with General Rochambeau in Newport, Rhode Island where the two commanding generals possibly planned Rochambeau's mobilization and the decisive Siege of Yorktown.Chronology of the \\"Tavern Hall Club House\\" previously called \\"The Lucca House\\" and \\"The Red House on the Corner\\". pp. 3-4 In: Tavern Hall Preservation Society 100th Anniversary. Tavern Hall Preservation Society, Kingston, RI 21pp. In 1785, the ground floor of the house was used as a residence and general store by the name of West India Store operated by storekeeper Thomas R. Wells, whose son Thomas Robinson Wells (1785-1853) married Maria Potter (1791-1831). The house later served as the home of South Kingstown's first newspaper The Rhode Island Advocate published by James Brenton in 1832. It was succeeded in 1854 by the South County Journal, which was renamed to become the Narragansett Times in 1864. For a short time from 1838-42, the house was owned by the Kingston Boot and Shoe Company, but the house was reacquired by Justice Potter in payment for outstanding debts on the mortgage. The house was then transferred to Justice Potter's brother Thomas Mawney Potter in 1843, and it remained in the Potter family until its sale to the Tavern Hall Club on 15 March 1919 by Carroll Potter. In the summer 1872, the house was rented to Austrian opera star Pauline Lucca and her retinue during her two-year concert tour in the United States and while she was in the beginning of a bitterly contested divorce.Wells, Herbert G. (1937). History of the Tavern Hall Club House (reprint) pp. 1-2 In: Tavern Hall Preservation Society 100th Anniversary. Tavern Hall Preservation Society, Kingston, RI 21pp. In 1882, Dr. Thomas Mawney Potter established a boarding house for women in the building, and in 1885, sisters Orpha and Elizabeth Rose established a millinery and women's clothing store famous for its worsted goods in a room on the ground floor. At the same time, the Rose sisters served as librarians for books held at the house that eventually became the nucleus of the book collection of the Kingston Free Library, which was later established in the mid-1890s at the Old King's County Courthouse in Kingston after the Washington County Courthouse was built in 1892. Upon the sale of the Reynolds House to the Tavern Hall Club in 1919, the building was used to house male members of the club. Later on, visitors to Kingston, including students attending Rhode Island State College (now the University of Rhode Island) stayed at the house. Additionally, in the 19th Century and early decades of the 20th Century it was used as a meeting place for the volunteer fire brigade of the village. The parlor and billiard room of the Reynolds House have been used since 1919 as the meeting place for the club and the boy scout troop since 1923, and as a venue for club-sponsored billiards tournaments. In 1959, the house was designated as part of the Kingston Village Historic District by the Town of South Kingstown, and in 1974, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Kingston Historic District.

Early years Eugene Smith was born on April 22, 1921. In 1933, Smith met Roberta Martin at Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church when he joined the junior chorus led by Martin. That same year, Smith became one of the original Roberta Martin Singers. Life Smith was born to devout parents from Mobile, Alabama, and attended Wendell Phillips High School in Chicago, IL. During the start of World War II, Smith briefly served in the Army, but was discharged for his height, which barely registered five feet. Smith married and had a son, Eugene Smith, Jr., but the marriage ended in divorce, and Smith became estranged from Eugene Jr. Musical career Smith sang with the Roberta Martin Singers from the group's inception until it disbanded after Martin's death in 1969. As Smith termed his relationship with Martin in a 1981 interview for the Smithsonian, he and Martin \\"went together like bacon and eggs.\\" Smith was known for his distinct baritone/tenor register, his unique delivery of songs which influenced the styles of other gospel singers such as Professor Alex Bradford and Rev. James Cleveland, and his trademark narration and sermonettes which would often stir worshippers in a frenzied ecstasy. Smith was often beckoned by music producers to release a solo album or to start his own group, but he refused and remained committed to The Roberta Martin Singers. In the early 1940s, Smith composed the gospel blues song \\"I Know the Lord Will Make a Way, Oh Yes He Will\\", which is still popular among congregations today, and in 1949, became the business manager and booking agent for the Roberta Martin Singers. After the group disbanded, Smith still sang in and around the Chicago area, and participated in various programs honoring The Roberta Martin Singers and other singers and musicians from the \\"Golden Era\\" of gospel until his death. Death Eugene Smith died in his sleep at his apartment in Chicago, Illinois, on May 9, 2009. He was 88 years old.

Plot  The film starts with a faux preview for The Magnificent Five Plus One, which promotes the Space Station crew as the stars. Richard Garriott is billed as 'The Gunfight Participant' – a satirical nod to his official status as a 'Spaceflight Participant.' A series of motion graphics under the credits leads us to a Soyuz spacecraft departing the International Space Station, bearing Garriott, Volkov, and Kononenko back to earth. Finke and Chamitoff wave goodbye but express their relief at Garriott's leaving as he was annoying them with his constant talk of computer games. Lonchakov insists that they all go back to work. One week later, Chamitoff and Fincke are both missing Garriott. Chamitoff could no longer juggle without Garriott, and Fincke knew Garriott was good at settling arguments about which of them was standing upside down. At this point Lonchakov points out that the oxygen use aboard the station is too high. Everyone theorizes wildly about the cause which universally involve interstellar aliens invading the station. A search of ridiculous locations on the station ensues during which the surprising nature of the alien is discovered. The completed film is just over eight minutes in length. It includes numerous references to classic science- fiction movies including The Day the Earth Stood Still, Forbidden Planet and Galaxy Quest.  Cast  * Yuri Lonchakov as Himself * Michael Fincke as Himself * Greg Chamitoff as Himself * Richard Garriott as \\"The Spaceflight Participant\\" * Helen Garriott as \\"The Spaceflight Participant's Mother\\"  Pre-production  Under contract with Garriott, Hickman quietly began development and pre-production under the cover title of Project Icarus. Once Garriott approved the script, the 'false preview' and 'opening credits' elements of the movie were produced prior to the flight and preloaded onto Garriott's flight camera. The opening credits were laid over graphics created by professional motion graphics artist Curtis Hickman, Tracy Hickman's son. Background video elements for the 'preview' were shot by Hickman at various locations outside St. George, Utah. Green screen elements of Helen Garriott — Richard's mother — were filmed in her home in Las Vegas. Project Icarus had some very stringent requirements: the film could not impact the crew work schedule, could not significantly add to the payload weight and volume restrictions, and had to be a fully executed and complete story. In addition to the video elements, Hickman produced a PowerPoint presentation file containing the shooting directions and cue cards (both in English and Russian) which could be displayed on a laptop aboard the ISS for the crew during filming.  Production  Garriott, as a private space explorer, flew into earth orbit aboard Soyuz TMA-13 on October 12, 2008, carrying with him a project code named Icarus. The original script was written for the equal participation of all six people aboard. When Garriott presented the idea to the cosmonauts and astronauts aboard, all were enthusiastic about the project but ultimately Volkov and Kononenko declined to participate for personal reasons although they still supported the project. This required Garriott to restructure the shooting of the script and the script itself while on orbit. Scenes were filmed in sequence during the crew's personal time so as not to impact their work schedule in any way. The scenes were filmed over several days and thereby only took a few minutes to set up and shoot sequences on any given day.  Post-production  Upon Garriott's return to his quarters in Star City, Russia immediately after his flight, he uploaded the HD video source files from his camera to a secure internet server, allowing Hickman to download them almost immediately to his office in South Jordan, Utah. Rough cuts of the film were completed within a week. The original film was produced in 16:9 widescreen format at 1080i HD resolution. This was subsequently rendered down to anamorphic widescreen NTSC standard.  Release  The film is available as a special feature on the DVD Man on a Mission, Mike Woolf's documentary about Richard Garriott's trip into space aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket. The DVD is available from First Run Features.

American troops crossed Lake Erie to capture or destroy stocks of grain and destroy mills at Port Dover, Ontario, which were used to provide flour for British troops stationed on the Niagara Peninsula. At the instigation of Lieutenant Colonel John B. Campbell and without sanction from his superiors or the government of the United States, the Americans also destroyed private houses and other property, prompting British commanders to demand reprisals in other theatres of the war. To some degree, the burning of Washington by the British later in the year was influenced by the American actions at Port Dover. Background In the spring of 1814, the Americans were preparing to make an attack across the Niagara River. As the Americans held undisputed control of Lake Erie, the troops at Presque Isle on the lake's southern shore were no longer needed to protect the improvised shipyard there, and were ordered to join the main American army at Buffalo, New York. The idea of raiding the Canadian settlements near Long Point and destroying the mills there en route to Buffalo occurred both to Captain Arthur Sinclair, commanding the armed vessels of the United States Navy on Lake Erie, and Lieutenant Colonel John B. Campbell, commanding the troops at Presque Isle. It took some days to assemble the expedition, in particular to obtain volunteers from the Pennsylvania Militia, and Sinclair later considered that the delay and publicity prevented the raid from achieving surprise. On 13 May 750 troops, composed of detachments of regulars (including artillery) and Pennsylvania militia, were embarked aboard Sinclair's ships. The expedition was accompanied by several renegade Canadian guides, including Abraham Markle.Hitsman & Graves, p.219 Raid In the late afternoon of 14 May, the Americans landed near Port Dover. There was a minor skirmish between American militiamen and some Canadian militiamen who were trying to remove goods from a storehouse.Ernest A. Cruikshank, The County of Norfolk in the War of 1912, in Zaslow, p.233 The Americans remained where they had disembarked during the night of 14 May. The next day, they marched to the village of Dover, where they drew up in formal line of battle, although there was no opposition. On Campbell's orders they then set fire to every building in the settlement: twenty houses, three flour mills, three sawmills, three distilleries, twelve barns and some other buildings. All livestock was shot, and their bodies left to rot. Some of Sinclair's sailors took the hind ends of the slaughtered hogs, but other than these opportune thefts, there was no plundering.'ernest A, Cruikshank, The County of Norfolk in the War of 1812, in Zaslow, p.234 Although the local women and children were allowed to remove their personal possessions from their houses before they were set on fire, they were able to remove only small items. Much of the property destroyed had belonged to Robert Nichol, who was noted for his support for the British authorities, at the instigation of Markle, who had been expelled from the local Legislative Assembly by Nichol. The Americans then re-embarked, but landed again the next day to burn another mill and a sawmill. They then returned to Presque Isle. During the entire raid, the only opposition had been some scattered Canadian militia, and a troop of the 19th Light Dragoons. The British had either received word of the impending raid, or had taken precautions against the possibility, and almost all the flour in the settlement (several hundred barrels) had already been removed to safety.Ernest A. Cruikshank, The County of Norfolk in the War of 1812, in Zaslow, p.235 Aftermath Brig Gen Winfield Scott presided over the Court of Enquiry against Lt Col John Campbell, after protest prompted the United States Army initiate an inquiry. Sinclair and several other American officers (particularly among the militia) were enraged by Campbell's actions. Campbell insisted, both at the time and subsequently in a note to the British Major General Phineas Riall, commanding the division on the Niagara Peninsula, that he personally ordered the destruction without any sanction from his superiors or the United States government, in retaliation for the burning of the American settlements of Havre de Grace (on Chesapeake Bay), Lewiston and Buffalo the previous year. The official notes of protest from Riall and complaints by Sinclair and other Americans prompted the United States Army to hold a Court of Enquiry, presided over by Brigadier General Winfield Scott, on 20 June. The court concluded that Campbell was justified in burning the mills and distilleries which might have been used to supply flour and spirits to the British forces, and that some adjacent buildings were unavoidably involved. However, Campbell was found to have made an error of judgement in destroying private houses and other buildings. No further disciplinary action was taken at the time, and Campbell was mortally wounded at the Battle of Chippawa on 5 July. =British response= Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, the Governor General of the Canadas and commander in chief of the forces there, wrote on 2 June to Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, commander of the North American Station of the Royal Navy, without noting that Campbell had not acted under orders: After the raid, George Prévost, the Governor General of the Canadas wrote to the commander of the Chesapeake campaign, Alexander Cochrane, advising him to inflict \\"a measure of retaliation which shall deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages.\\" > ...in consequence of the late disgraceful conduct of the American troops in > the wanton destruction of private property on the north shores of Lake Erie, > in order that if the war with the United States continues you may, should > you judge it advisable, assist in inflicting that measure of retaliation > which shall deter the enemy from a repetition of similar > outrages.Cruikshank, Documentary History, p.402 Cochrane in turn wrote from his station in Bermuda on 18 June to John Wilson Croker, the Secretary to the Admiralty: > I am most decidedly of opinion that the readiest way to attain this object > is to bring home to the supporters of the Government which authorizes this > unnatural system of warfare a full share of its dreadful calamities and to > this end, I have issued to the commanding officer of H.M. blockading > squadron an order, accompanied by a secret memorandum... > ORDER FOR RETALIATION > No. 1 > By the Honorable Alexander Cochrane, K.B. &c;, &c;, &c.; > Whereas... it appears that the American troops in Upper Canada have > committed the most wanton and unjustifiable outrages on the unoffending > inhabitants by burning their mills and houses, and by a general devastation > of private property... > You are hereby required and directed to destroy and lay waste such towns > and districts as you may find assailable. You will hold strictly in view the > conduct of the American army towards His Majesty's unoffending Canadian > subjects and you will spare merely the lives of the unarmed inhabitants of > the United States.Cruikshank, Documentary History, pp.414–415 In the appended secret memorandum, Cochrane modified these severe orders by instructing his commanders to spare places which furnished supplies to British ships or troops, or to levy contributions in return for forbearance, in proportion to the value of goods and buildings spared. This code of conduct was followed by the British during the Raid on Alexandria.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of the wealthy publisher of the Boston Herald, Choate attended the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire for his high school education. After World War II, during which he served in the United States Navy, he received his bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1949. Subsequently, he relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, where he worked as a construction engineer and became wealthy in his own right through real estate investments. In the late 1950s, during a trip abroad, he contracted a strain of hepatitis. While recuperating, he read the memoirs of Walter Francis White, the former leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Choate, a lifelong Republican, became inspired to use his wealth to battle what he saw as the greatest social ills afflicting America: poverty, hunger, and a lack of civil and political rights for African Americans and other minority groups. Among the ventures he undertook to that end over the next several decades were the publishing of a magazine dedicated to social justice, called Reveille; founding a number of social welfare programs and charities in the Phoenix area; organizing a Southwest conference on poverty, which included such speakers as Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Peace Corps director Sargent Shriver; working in Washington, D.C. as a lobbyist for groups such as the Citizens Crusade Against Poverty; and serving as a consultant to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, where he was credited with initiating a national study on malnutrition. His efforts were later credited with the formation of the United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, which operated from 1968 to 1977, and the creation of the White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health, which met in 1969. In September 1970, Choate became famous when he testified before the Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs on the nutritional content (specifically, vitamins, dietary minerals, and protein) of the 60 bestselling brands of dry breakfast cereal in the United States. Choate told the Committee, that, on a scale from 0 to 900, with 900 being the best, 40 of the cereals ranked below 100 and were therefore \\"empty calories\\" which \\"fatten but do little to prevent malnutrition.\\" Only three products -- Kellogg Company's Product 19 and General Mills' Kaboom and Total—scored as high as 700. Choate's testimony received much publicity nationally (with a headline in Time asking, \\"Breakfast of Chumps?\\"), sparking a public relations war between Choate and the various cereal companies. Although the companies heatedly denied Choate's charges, public opinion eventually sided with him, and the companies decided to voluntarily add nutrition facts labels to their products' boxes, so that consumers could judge their nutritional value for themselves. In later years, Choate continued his education, receiving a master's degree in education from Harvard University, before relocating to California, where he started Operation Civic Serve, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting volunteering amongst college students. On May 3, 2009, he died of natural causes in a retirement community in Lemon Grove, California. He was survived by four children from two of his three marriages, each of which ended in divorce, and three grandchildren.

Biography Gedovius was born in Mexico City in 1867 before moving as an infant with his family to San Luis Potosí. When he was sixteen years old he returned to Mexico City to attend the Academy of San Carlos, where he was a pupil of Salomé Pina and Rafael Flores. At the age of twenty, and after four years of study at San Carlos, he was sent by his father to Germany to continue his studies and to receive medical treatment at clinics specializing in the treatment of deafness since birth. Gedovius recovered successfully after a year because of their medical efforts, and he began to speak, learning German. He moved to Munich, where he learned to draw with charcoal at the Royal Academy and restarted his painting classes. Under the guidance of Master Herterich, he honed his drawing skills, and Wilhelm von Diez introduced him to color techniques. He supplemented his learning by visiting several museums in Europe, especially in Germany, Holland, Belgium, France and Italy. Influenced greatly by the Dutch Baroque painting he saw, he painted his most famous work, his self-portrait, in which he wears a Flemish outfit very similar to works made by Rembrandt or Frans Hals. This self- portrait earned him a gold medal from the Royal Academy of Munich. After living in Europe for eleven years, Gedovius returned to Mexico in 1893. In 1903 he was awarded a teaching place in the Academy of fine arts and was given the arduous task of make that institution better-known in the Mexican art world. His friendship with Justo Sierra at the time of the reorganization of the national school of fine arts was very timely, allowed him to be part of the magisterial body along with other painters of the stature of Antonio Fabrés, Leandro Izaguirre, and Julio Ruelas. Gedovius taught chiaroscuro, color, and composition beginning in the first decade of the 20th century. Among his students are Ángel Zárraga, Diego Rivera, Alberto Garduño, and María Izquierdo among others. His most outstanding works include the already mentioned 'Self-portrait' and 'The Lady of the Violets', as well as 'Convento del Carmen', 'Tepotzotlán Sacristy', 'Poppies' and others. Gedovius continued teaching classes, both in the Academy and in a private Studio until shortly before his death in May 1937 in Mexico City.Biography @ the Colleción Andrés Blaisten References Category:Mexican portrait painters Category:1867 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Artists from Mexico City Category:19th- century Mexican painters Category:19th-century male artists Category:Mexican male painters Category:20th-century Mexican painters Category:20th-century male artists ","title":"Germán Gedovius"},{"id":"22759330","text":"Sydney Film School is a private film school based in Waterloo, a suburb of Sydney.

As such, our major ports and related infrastructure provide the key locations for supply chain activities servicing both bulk and container facilities. The private sector is the major player in port operations and investment, with the regulatory framework set by government. State and territory governments have responsibility for land use planning and controls, including for ports, their adjacent land areas and connecting transport systems. Local government also makes decisions that affect ports, including on matters such as planning requirements and local road access. State or territory governments have historically owned port authorities; however there is a trend toward privatising these assets on a long-term lease basis. Commonwealth responsibilities relating to ports include: environmental assessment of port developments where matters of national environmental significance are concerned, safety and security matters, customs, and implementing Australia's international maritime obligations as they relate to ports. = Australia's freight task = Australia's ports handle the fifth largest shipping task of any nation in the world moving over $1.2 billion worth of freight daily.

Clay May, 194 U.S. 267 (1904), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court which held that a Texas law did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by penalizing only railroad companies for allowing certain weeds to mature and go to seed on their land.. Overview Clay May, a Texas farmer who was not represented by counsel, obtained a penalty payment of US$25 from the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway of Texas (the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway's Texas subsidiary), also known as the \\"MKT\\", for having allowed Johnson grass to grow on its land. Under a 1901 Texas law, any railroad allowing Johnson grass or Russian thistle to mature and go to seed on their land would have to pay this penalty to owners of adjacent land, as long as those owners had not done the same thing. The MKT appealed and lost, and then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the law violated the equal- treatment provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, as it penalized only railroad companies and not other individuals or companies that allowed these weeds to grow. Decision Justice Holmes, less than two years into his service on the Supreme Court, wrote for the Court's majority that a state law \\"should not be disturbed by the courts under the 14th Amendment, unless they can see clearly that there is no fair reason for the law that would not require ... its extension to others whom it leaves untouched.\\" He wrote the Court felt \\"unable to say\\" whether the law was too arbitrary; that \\"it would have been more obviously fair\\" to also penalize highways; but offered several possible explanations for the Texas legislature's singling out of the railroads, and wrote that \\"legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.\\" This latter line has been quoted numerous times in subsequent U.S. Supreme Court opinions, when the author of an opinion or dissent has deferred to a legislature.US Supreme Court cases citing this case, FindLaw, fetched 10 May 2009.

Life and timesEarly career= Luis Huergo was born in Buenos Aires, in 1837, to a family of prosperous retailers. He was sent to the Jesuit Mount St. Mary's University previously known as Mount St. Mary's College, where he obtained his secondary education from 1852 to 1857. Returning to Argentina, he assisted urbanist Pedro Benoit plan the first road to Ensenada (a harbor town 56 km (35 mi) south of Buenos Aires) and earned a degree as a surveyor from the Topography and Geodesics School of Buenos Aires, in 1862. Huergo was among the first class to enroll at the School of Engineering created by the President of the University of Buenos Aires, Juan María Gutiérrez, in 1866, and four years later, his thesis on the value of roads earned him the school's first engineering degree.Planetario Galilei: Luis Hergo Huergo designed flood control projects for the torrential Tercero River and other Córdoba Province waterways. He also designed 120 railroad bridges during his early career, as well as the harbor of the city of San Fernando. Huergo co-founded the Argentine Scientific Society in 1872 and the Argentine Geographic Institute, in 1879.Monografías He taught at the newly created School of Mathematics of the University of Buenos Aires from 1874, and was designated its dean in 1881. =The port= Huergo's plans to build a house at the mouth of the Riachuelo River flowing along Buenos Aires' industrial southside earned him the appointment of Director of the Riachuelo Works Bureau in 1876. This powerful post enabled him to develop the Port of La Boca, the first modern port in Buenos Aires. The port's opening in 1880 coincided with a sudden economic boom in Argentina, and the Provincial Legislature awarded him a generous budget for improvements, including a breakwater and the dredging of the silty Riachuelo mouth to 6.5 m (21 ft).Puerto Madero: history His ambitious proposal for a massive, new port north of the one at La Boca received initial support in the Argentine Congress, though the backing of Argentina's main financier (Barings Bank) for a proposal put forth by local import-export mogul Eduardo Madero helped sway congre ssional support away from Huergo's proposal. Madero's project was approved by Congress in 1882. Huergo appealed the decision on the grounds that it would be uneconomical to build and difficult to modify, once new, larger freighters began to arrive. Madero's project was signed into law by President Julio Roca in 1884, however, and in 1886, Huergo resigned his post at the Riachuelo Bureau. =New projects and a new port= Huergo continued to campaign against the costly Puerto Madero works in his capacity as Dean of the School of Exact Sciences at Buenos Aires, while also accepting new projects. Returning to Córdoba Province, he designed San Roque Reservoir in 1888 as a means to prevent flooding along the Suquia and Cosquín Rivers. He was appointed Minister of Public Works for the important Province of Buenos Aires and designed Puerto Belgrano, the Argentine Navy's first deep-water port. Huergo designed a canal from the city of Córdoba to the Paraná River, over 320 km (200 mi) to the east, and the Port of Asunción, Paraguay. The accomplished engineer was named director of the oil field discovered at Comodoro Rivadavia, in 1907. The nation's first such discovery, the office served as a precursor to YPF, the state oil concern established in 1922. Another reflection of the booming Argentine economy of the time, maritime shipping, had increased dramatically since Huergo's proposal for the Port of Buenos Aires had been passed over in 1882. The tonnage of vessels arriving at the port jumped from 4 million to 20 million by 1907, and in September of that year, Congress approved the construction of a new port. The facility would be built north of Madero's nearly-obsolete docks, and the design would be Huergo's. Work started in 1911 on the massive, new port, which included six open inner harbors, separated by cargo piers and protected by two breakwaters.Puerto Nuevo Luis Huergo did not live to see the new port's completion, and he died in 1913, at age 76. His port design solved the very limitations he had anticipated for the former facility, and his many and early contributions to his country's infrastructure made him Argentina's \\"first engineer.\\" References and external links Category:1837 births Category:1913 deaths Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine people of Spanish descent Category:University of Buenos Aires alumni Category:St. Mary's College of Maryland alumni Category:Argentine engineers Category:Argentine mathematicians Category:University of Buenos Aires faculty Category:Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery Category:Deans (academic) ","title":"Luis Huergo"},{"id":"22759362","title":"Ngada Regency"},{"id":"22759401","title":"1999 Indian general election in Andhra Pradesh"},{"id":"22759410","text":"St Agnes is a suburb of Adelaide, South Australia.

He was born in 1955 and is Danish, married with Tina Waldorff and having two grown up children. He was elected as General Secretary of Public Services International during the 28th Congress in Vienna, Austria on 24–28 September 2007, his mandate ended in November 2012 when he was not re- elected at the 29th Congress in Durban. 2011-2013 Chair of The Council of Global Unions. Previous to his election, Peter was President of HK/Stat the trade union for Government and Public Employees in Denmark from 1998 to 2007, and in that capacity, he was already an active member of the PSI Executive Board and the EPSU Executive Committee. In Denmark, Peter had several other mandates in trade union organisations and pension funds. His trade union activity started in 1975 when he was a youth activist in the HK union, and he went from strength to strength, becoming youth secretary in 1981, then in 1986 collective bargaining officer for the HK/State Sector. From 1992 to 1998, he was Head of Secretariat of HK/Stat. Peter worked for eight years in the municipality of Lyngby-Taarbaek, north of Copenhagen, where he was also shop steward. His work there was mainly in the tax department, and he spent the last year in the department for child day care. His formal education was in the area of local government and further training combined with courses in economics, languages, management, ICT and organisational development. Peter’s achievements in the collective bargaining sphere include obtaining binding agreements for state sector employees, enabling them to develop their competences and take on more demanding positions. He was also involved in the 2005 agreement to set up so-called integration positions targeted at persons with a non-Danish ethnical background (immigrants and their descendants) who experience difficulties accessing the labour market. Peter is convinced that Quality Public Services is vital fighting growing inequality. He also underlines the importance of collective bargaining, which is a vital tool for unions everywhere to achieve decent working conditions.

It is 12 kilometres north of the central business district. History Pooraka was originally a subdivision of section 97 of the Hundred of Yatala, the latter spanning from Grand Junction Road, at Gepps Cross, to a point north of Montague Road. It was originally known as Dry Creek after the local watercourse (Dry Creek), which is now the name of a modern industrial locality west of Pooraka, at the creek's mouth (Dry Creek, South Australia). In 1916, the District Council of Yatala renamed the suburb Pooraka, which was believed to be an indigenous Kaurna word meaning 'dry', however, according to modern expert Robert Amery, the name bears no resemblance to the Kaurna words for 'dry' or 'creek'. The term has been identified as a New South Welsh indigenous name for the turpentine tree, which is not found in South Australia. Pooraka East Post Office opened on 1 December 1965 and closed in 1986. A railway station on the Northfield railway line (initially known as Abattoirs, but later renamed Pooraka) operated from 1913 until it was closed on 29 May 1987.

The AETF was originally called the Australasian Emissions Trading Forum, and was founded in 1998 under the auspices of the Sydney Futures Exchange following a proposal from Beck Consulting Services. From 2001 until 2011 the AETF published the AETF Review (Bib ID 3998494), held regular member meetings and convened numerous events and conferences. The AETF Review was published six times per year and included original articles on emissions trading developments and related topics. In 2011 the AETF formed the foundation of the new Carbon Market Institute, a not-for-profit institute, established in Melbourne, Australia to continue and develop the AETF programs. The AETF was founded to assist all potential stakeholders understand and respond to emissions trading developments both domestically and internationally. Emissions trading is a key element of the Kyoto Protocol and subsequent proposals to manage global greenhouse gas emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. National or regional schemes are operating in the European Union, New Zealand and the United States and are under active consideration in China, Japan and elsewhere. In Australia, legislation under Clean Energy Future Scheme has been passed to introduce a national emissions trading scheme from 2015.  Australia’s Clean Energy Future Scheme  The policy and legislative background The current Australian government's Clean Energy Future legislative package represents the culmination of an unprecedented policy development effort in Australia, supported by detailed economic modelling undertaken by the Department of the Treasury (Australia). This package includes a price on carbon from July 2012 transitioning into a national cap and trade scheme from July 2015. The December 2008 Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) White Paper was one milestone towards the Government's ultimate policy objective of implementing a cost-effective and forward-looking climate policy, which fully accounts for Australia's particular environmental, economic and geopolitical situation. Australia's emissions reduction target The Australian Government in February 2010 submitted its plans for incorporation into the Copenhagen Accord for cutting emissions by the year 2020. Australia will have a 5 per cent reduction target with no conditions applying and will only lift its target to 15 per cent or 25 per cent if countries like China, India and the United States agree to verifiable reductions. This is in line with previous Government announcements on Australian emissions reduction levels.

It features several songs performed in the film, as well as the musical score by John Williams and Dory and André Previn. Background The soundtrack was released in 1967. Dionne Warwick sang the title track, however, her version is not on the soundtrack album, only on the actual film soundtrack. According to Susann, she wrote her own lyric for the film's title track as she felt that Dory Previn's lyric did not establish the story's background. Warwick was signed to Scepter Records at the time and could not contractually appear on the soundtrack album. Therefore, a re-recorded version appears on the LP Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls. The film contains two versions of the theme song with different lyrics: one version plays over the opening credits, and the other, with the same lyrics as Warwick's recorded version, is heard towards the end of the film. Warwick performed the song on the January 29, 1968 episode of the CBS television variety series The Carol Burnett Show a month after the film was released. Margaret Whiting recorded \\"I'll Plant My Own Tree\\" for the film, while Eileen Wilson recorded it for the soundtrack album. The song is dubbed for Susan Hayward, while \\"It's Impossible\\" and \\"Give a Little More\\" are both dubbed by Gaille Heidemann for Patty Duke. Heidemann and Wilson are uncredited on the soundtrack label. The original version of \\"I'll Plant My Own Tree\\" (recorded by Judy Garland before she was fired from the film) was finally released in 1976 on a compilation LP, Cut! Outtakes from Hollywood's Greatest Musicals. Lovely Me: The Life of Jacqueline Susann (1987) by Barbara Seaman states that Ruth Batchelor, who wrote lyrics for Elvis Presley, wrote the lyrics for a title song for the movie. Batchelor's song was rejected by the studio as the Previns had already written the soundtrack. It was recorded by The Arbors and used as the opening theme to the 1967 documentary \\"Jacqueline Susann and the Valley of the Dolls\\". Reception Stephen Thomas Erlweine of AllMusic wrote: \\"Dory and André Previn's score for the kitsch classic Valley of the Dolls is a deliciously campy collection of swinging jazz and pop underpinned with humor and tongue-in-cheek sensuality.

Football career Barlow was born in Bolton and after playing for Halliwell Rovers of the Lancashire League, he joined Bolton Wanderers in May 1898. He was soon established at the inside-left position, playing sixteen matches, with five goals, but was unable to prevent Bolton being relegated to the Second Division at the end of the season. In the following season, he made only fourteen League appearances, with newly signed Jack Picken being preferred by secretary/manager Frank Brettell. At the end of the season, Bolton regained their place in the First Division as runners-up to The Wednesday. Back in the top flight, Picken was moved to inside-right and Barlow once again became settled in the No. 10 shirt, scoring 10 goals from 28 appearances in the 1901–02 season. He remained at Bolton until the summer of 1902, when he moved to the south coast to join Southampton of the Southern League. At the \\"Saints\\", he was considered to be \\"a capture\\" and was described in the local press as \\"a player who combines good ball control and distribution with legitimate trickery\\". He made his debut in the opening match of the 1902–03 season, scoring twice in a 6–0 victory over Brentford (with three goals from Jack Fraser). His performances at The Dell soon impressed the England selectors and he was chosen to represent \\"The South\\" in a trial match against \\"The North\\" played at White Hart Lane, although he was not selected for the national side. By early 1903, Barlow was beginning to feel \\"homesick\\" and following the return of Fred Harrison from injury in January he lost his place in the side, making only two further appearances at left-half. At the end of the season, when Saints won the Southern League title for the fifth time in seven years, Barlow was granted a transfer back to Burnden Park. Barlow only made five league appearances in the 1903–04 season, with Wattie White now established at inside-left, and in the summer of 1904 he returned to the Southern League to join Millwall Athletic. In his two spells with Bolton, he made 90 appearances in League and Cup matches, scoring 25 goals. He remained at Millwall for one season before returning to Lancashire to join Atherton Church House of the Lancashire Combination before finishing his career at Oldham Athletic, playing their final season in the Lancashire Combination, at the end of which they were champions and elected to the Football League.

BiographyEarly life= Olry was born on 28 June 1880 in Lille in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France. The son of Albert Olry, himself a polytechnicien, Olry was admitted to the École Polytechnique in 1900. Upon graduating, he joined the 21st Artillery Regiment and was appointed the rank of lieutenant on 10 October 1904. =Military career= During the First World War, Olry served in the Second Army at the Battle of Verdun under the command of then-general Philippe Pétain. He left for Italy in 1917 as part of the French expeditionary force and participated in combat near the Piave River, and in 1918 assumed command of the 283rd Artillery Regiment. His conduct during the war earned him five citations. Olry became secretary of the Supreme Council of National Defense () in 1922 and served with the French military mission to Greece until 1928, when he was promoted to colonel of the 309th Artillery Regiment. He was promoted again in 1932 to the rank of Brigadier General and in 1935 to Divisional General (a rank equivalent to Major General) with command of the 29th Infantry Division, which he led until 1937. He later became commander of the 15th Army Corps in the southern Alps. On 5 December 1939 Olry assumed command of the Army of the Alps. When Italy invaded France in June 1940, he commanded 190,000 men on the Alpine Line. Faced with an Italian force of 450,000, Olry's troops successfully stopped the Italian advance and then proved a tough opponent for the German troops which joined the battle. The performance of the French army in this theatre was far more successful than on the rest of the front and preserved some areas of France from occupation. =Final years and death= During the interim period following the French surrender Olry served as an inspector general. He was then appointed to command the 1st Divisional Group of the French Armistice Army: comprising four divisions in the non-occupied south. In June 1942 he reached retirement age and took up residence on his family estate in the Charente region of Mansle. Olry died on 3 January 1944 in Angoulême. Decorations Olry was awarded the Légion d'honneur, the highest military decoration in France, at Officier rank (see Légion d'honneur#Classes and insignia) in 1920 and became a Commandeur of the Légion d'honneur in 1936.

On Saturday, May 5, 1945, Mitchell, who at that time was the pastor of the C&MA; church (now called \\"Standing Stone Church of the Christian and Missionary Alliance\\") in Bly, Oregon, led a Sunday School picnic up into the nearby mountains of southern Oregon. Accompanying Mitchell was his five-months- pregnant wife, Elsie (née Winters), and five children from the church. Up in the mountains, Mitchell drove the car around by the road, while the others hiked through the woods. While Mitchell was getting the lunch out of the car near Leonard Creek, the others called to him and said that they had found what looked to be a balloon. Unbeknownst to the group, this was a dangerous Japanese incendiary Fu-Go balloon bomb. As Mitchell was warning them not to touch it, there was a large explosion. Mitchell ran to the spot and found the whole group dead.

Indo-China mission  On December 23, 1947, Mitchell with his new bride Betty (née Patzke, the older sister of two of the children killed by the fire balloon in Bly) sailed to Indo-China for what was the beginning of two five- year terms of service as missionaries to the Vietnamese people of Da Lat. After a two-year furlough, the Mitchells' third term of service would be their assignment at the Ban Me Thuot Leprosarium. On Wednesday evening, May 30, 1962, Mitchell and the rest of the staff of the leprosarium were preparing to meet at Dr. Vietti's house for their weekly prayer meeting. At dusk, around 7:45 p.m., a group of 12 members of the Viet Cong entered the leprosarium grounds, which was located about nine miles from Ban Me Thuot. The Viet Cong split up into three groups of four members each, and one group met Dan Gerber, who served with the Mennonite Central Committee, and tied him up. A second group went to the Mitchell home, ordered Archie out of the house, tied him up, and led him away with Dan Gerber. This was witnessed by the members of the Mitchell family including his wife, Betty, and three of their four children, Rebecca (age 13), Loretta (age 10), and Glenn (age 8). The youngest Mitchell child, daughter Geraldine (age 4), was already asleep in bed. Another group of Viet Cong went to Vietti's house and found her in bed. She was ordered to get up, dress, and she was led out of the compound, unbound, to join the other two captives.MISSIONARIES KIDNAPPED—HOW IT HAPPENED: Adapted from The Alliance Weekly, June 27, 1962, www.alliancelife.org. November 2008. Accessed 2009-05-24. The Viet Cong planned to take Betty and the children captive as well, but were convinced by the missionaries that they would only fully cooperate if Betty and the children were left behind. The Viet Cong also ransacked the buildings for any supplies they could use, including linens, medicines, clothing, and surgical equipment. At around 10:00 p.m. that evening the Viet Cong left the compound taking the prisoners (Mitchell, Gerber, and Vietti) and supplies with them. This all happened without any shots fired or any bloodshed. After their capture both American and South Vietnamese military intelligence agencies immediately discovered where the captives were probably being detained, and also confirmed that the Viet Cong used the missionaries' medical expertise to treat their own sick and wounded. While military intelligence was able to successfully track the movements of Mitchell, Gerber, and Vietti, the heavy and continuous Viet Cong presence in and around the area they were being held captive did not allow the military to mount a rescue mission. Missionary officials also attempted to negotiate for release of the captives. Although, by 1969, negotiations between the C&MA; and some Viet Cong soldiers appeared close to securing their release, the negotiations collapsed and never could be reconstituted.

History The unit was formed on 10 February 1942 by combining one division (buntai) from Chitose Air Group that was previously stationed in the Central Pacific, and two divisions from Takao Air Group that participated in the conquest of the Philippines and Dutch East Indies. They operated the new Mitsubishi G4M Rikko Navy Type 1 Attack Bomber aircraft. That same month, the group was deployed to Rabaul, New Britain to support Japanese operations during the early stages of the New Guinea Campaign. On first as part of the 24th Air Flotilla and from April as part of the 25th Air Flotilla. On 20 February, a flying boat from Yokohama Air Group spotted US carrier task force centered around Lexington 460 nautical miles from Rabaul. 4th Air Group medium bombers were order to attack the task force with bombs, since Type 91 aerial torpedoes have not yet arrived to the newly captured outpost at Rabaul. To make matter worse, external fuel tanks for Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters stationed at Rabaul have not yet arrived either, which meant that they could not escort the bombers at such distance. The attack formation consisted of 17 G4M, each equipped with two 250 kg bombs, and was led by unit's Hikōtaichō Lieutenant Commander Shichiso Miyauchi, who flew as an observer in the lead aircraft. In the ensuing action off Bougainville, the unit lost 15 bombers to enemy F4F Wildcat fighters and anti-aircraft fire (including its Hikōtaichō and two Buntaichōs). Only a few bombers managed to come close enough to release the bombs at Lexington, however they all missed the carrier, where the closest bomb landed about 30 meters astern. The lead bomber attempted to crash into Lexington, but it was downed 1400 meters before the carrier. The 4th Air Group losses were soon replenished and then regularly conducted bombing raids against Port Moresby on New Guinea from March to August. On 7 May 1942, they had a minor involvement in the Battle of the Coral Sea, where they performed a torpedo attack on Allied cruisers around Jomard Passage. They scored no hit and lost five of 12 aircraft. torpedo attack on Allied ships off Guadalcanal on 8 August 1942. On 7 August 1942, the 4th Air Group prepared to strike a newly discovered enemy airfield near Milne Bay on New Guinea, when the shocking news of Allied landing on Guadalcanal came in. The commanders decided that there is no time to exchange bombs for torpedoes and send 27 G4M bombers to attack the beached near Lunga Point. The formation was Led by Lieutenant Rempei Egawa and reached Guadalcanal shortly after 13:00. They scored no hits on the ships, for the loss of four aircraft. The next morning, Lieutenant Shigeru Kotani (senior Buntaichō) led 17 bombers from 4th Air Group (joined by nine from Misawa Air Group), this time properly equipped with torpedoes, for another strike against the ships near the beachhead. The ship-based anti-aircraft fire was decimated the formation and only a few managed to release their torpedoes, one damaging a destroyer. On top of that, the few surviving aircraft were then ambushed by F4F fighters on the way out. In total, only five severely damaged aircraft managed to return to Rabaul and 125 men perished in the attack, including all officers. The 4th Air Group participated in frequent attacks on Henderson Field during the initial stage of Guadalcanal Campaign. In late September 1942, after taking heavy losses, the unit was withdrawn from the area.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 23, 2009. The episode was written by Chris Briggs and Peter A. Knight, and directed by Alex Hardcastle. In \\"O Biclops, Where Art Thou?\\", Kröd and Aneka seek a stolen diamond from a bisexual cyclops in order to join the ranks of an elite resistance council, and Dongalor tries to capture the heart of his kidnapped villager girlfriend. Plot Freedom fighter Kröd Mändoon (Sean Maguire) and his friends try to conduct a raid on an Imperial wagon to help the Resistance's ailing finances, but they are unsuccessful when the group can't stop bickering about their Casual Friday attire (Zezelryck is unhappy about Loquasto wearing assless chaps, while Aneka is furious at the fact Krod expects her to wear a chastity belt). While they are arguing, they are interrupted by the warlock Grimshank (John Rhys-Davies) and Ralph Longshaft (James Murray), the swordsman who previously saved Kröd and Aneka (India de Beaufort). They invite Kröd and Aneka to join the freedom-fighting Elite Resistance Council if they can retrieve the valuable Bloodstone of Alluvia diamond from the lair of an evil cyclops. The group arrive at the cyclops' lair, but instead of a terrifying monster, they find a decadent creature named \\"Cy\\" (Jonathan Slinger) who wears bikini briefs and offers the fighters snacks and mojitos in his hot tub. Cy insists his bloodthirsty father was the one who stole the diamond, but that he did not approve of his father and would let the group have the diamond. Kröd agrees to some quick cocktails (despite Zezelryck's bad feeling about the whole thing), and they all play a game of Truth or Dare? in the hot tub, where Cy admits he is a bisexual cyclops, or \\"biclops\\", and Aneka admits she has had sex with a troll (prompting an angry Kröd to ask if there is anywhere she draws the line). When Kröd insists it's time to leave, Cy pulls a switch and traps the freedom fighters in a cage, where he plans to 'sex them to death' and make more furniture for his cave from their skeletons. However, Aneka distracts Cy by getting intimate with Kröd long enough for him to retrieve a throwing star from her underwear, and Kröd throws it into Cy's forehead. Kröd and the group escape, tie Cy to a chair and take the diamond. Cy apologizes and explains since his breakup with \\"Lisa and Chad\\" that \\"I've been such a man whore, humping and eating everything in sight.\\" Kröd and Aneka return the diamond to the Elite Resistance Council, where Grimshank confirms its authenticity and Longshaft welcomes them to the council. Later, Longshaft tells Kröd he planned to ask Aneka to spend the weekend with him, but wanted Kröd's permission due to their romantic past. Kröd approves of the idea, insisting \\"men-ches before wenches\\", but appears visibly jealous when Longshaft and Aneka ride off together...especially when he learns what Aneka's taking with her. Meanwhile, the evil Chancellor Dongalor (Matt Lucas) and his advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) set off to steal back Dongalor's girlfriend (Remie Purtill-Clarke), a peasant girl he had previously kidnapped from a village, who has been taken by the emperor's nephew. Dongalor finds her and tells her he plans to use the Eye of Gulga Grymna, an ancient weapon, to kill Emperor Xanus and steal his crown, and he wants her by his side. He proposes and she agrees, but as the two ride off together in their carriage, she begins coughing blood. Dongalor realizes she has the plague, but insists he will get medical help for her. She dies a brief time later; her tombstone is marked simply, \\"Cute Girl\\". Later, while Dongalor mourns in his castle, Barnabus cheers him up by bringing him the Bloodstone of Alluvia. Barnabus does not explain how he got it, but Dongalor recognizes it as the lens of the Eye of Gulga Grymna, a key to unleashing the weapon's power. Production \\"O Biclops, Where Art Thou?\\" was written by Chris Briggs and Peter Knight, and directed by Alex Hardcastle. It originally aired April 23, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. The episode was filmed in Budapest, Hungary. Within a week of the episode's original broadcast, the official Comedy Central website included four deleted scenes from \\"O Biclops Where Art Thou?\\". The first 75-second clip is an extended scene of Dongalor proposing to the Cute Girl, in which he discusses his empty heart and his \\"empty bed...well, empty except for the concubines.\\" In the second clip, an extended scene of the hottub Truth or Dare? game, upon learning that Aneka slept with a troll who lost an eye in battle, an exasperated Kröd asks, \\"Where do you draw the line? Have you ever 69ed an orc? Teabagged an ogre? Tossed a hobgoblin's salad?\\" In the third, two-minute clip, Kröd expresses excitement about being called before the Elite Resistance Council, and Aneka expresses anger that he wanted to go without her. When the two next appear before the council together, the elder Gustav the Short and Curly and Kröd gets into an argument over whether one should have pubic hair atop their heads. In the final, one-minute clip, Kröd expresses anger upon learning of the Pagan village attack: \\"They can raid our villages, they can burn our crops, they can steal our cattle, but I refuse to live in a world where good men are shot in the anuses!\\" Kröd and his friends then get into a discussion about how to pluralize anus before visiting the village. These cuts remain in the UK version. Reception Matt Fowler said \\"O Biclops, Where Art Thou?\\" was another \\"mostly flat\\" episode and that while a few jokes connect, most are obvious and infantile. Fowler also said he was growing tired of Kröd's constant prudishness around sexual norm-breakers, and that the Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce characters are growing unnecessary because, \\"not every joke needs to have each member of the gang chime in with a comment telling us what the joke is.\\" However, Fowler said he enjoyed the subplot with Dongalor and his unnamed girlfriend, and said Lucas and McQueen work very well together. Doug Knoop of The Seattle Times, however, singled this episode out as one of the main reasons he liked the series: \\"It may not be to everyone's taste, but in last week's episode when (Krod) and his band of warriors ended up in a hot tub with a Cyclops, I knew this new outrageous parody series had found a place in my heart.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * \\"O Biclops, Where Art Thou?\\" at TV.com Category:2009 American television episodes Category:2009 British television episodes Category:Kröd Mändoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire episodes ","title":"O Biclops, Where Art Thou?"},{"id":"22759867","title":"List of flags of the Royal Thai Armed Forces"},{"id":"22759879","text":"In mathematics, a nowhere commutative semigroup is a semigroup S such that, for all a and b in S, if ab = ba then a = b.A. H. Clifford, G. B. Preston (1964). The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups Vol. I (Second Edition). American Mathematical Society (p.26). A semigroup S is nowhere commutative if and only if any two elements of S are inverses of each other. Characterization of nowhere commutative semigroups Nowhere commutative semigroups can be characterized in several different ways. If S is a semigroup then the following statements are equivalent: *S is nowhere commutative. *S is a rectangular band (in the sense in which the term is used by John Howie ). *For all a and b in S, aba = a. *For all a, b and c in S, a2 = a and abc = ac. Even though, by definition, the rectangular bands are concrete semigroups, they have the defect that their definition is formulated not in terms of the basic binary operation in the semigroup. The approach via the definition of nowhere commutative semigroups rectifies this defect. To see that a nowhere commutative semigroup is a rectangular band, let S be a nowhere commutative semigroup. Using the defining properties of a nowhere commutative semigroup, one can see that for every a in S the intersection of the Green classes Ra and La contains the unique element a. Let S/L be the family of L-classes in S and S/R be the family of R-classes in S. The mapping :ψ : S -> (S/R) × (S/L) defined by :aψ = (Ra, La) is a bijection. If the Cartesian product (S/R) × (S/L) is made into a semigroup by furnishing it with the rectangular band multiplication, the map ψ becomes an isomorphism. So S is isomorphic to a rectangular band. Other claims of equivalences follow directly from the relevant definitions.

There are two famous algorithms to achieve asymptotically optimal packing in k-uniform hypergraphs. One of them is a random greedy algorithm which was proposed by Joel Spencer. He used a branching process to formally prove the optimal achievable bound under some side conditions. The other algorithm is called the Rödl nibble and was proposed by Vojtěch Rödl et al. They showed that the achievable packing by the Rödl nibble is in some sense close to that of the random greedy algorithm. History The problem of finding the number of such subsets in a k-uniform hypergraph was originally motivated through a conjecture by Paul Erdős and Haim Hanani in 1963. Vojtěch Rödl proved their conjecture asymptotically under certain conditions in 1985. Pippenger and Joel Spencer generalized Rödl's results using a random greedy algorithm in 1989. Definition and terminology In the following definitions, the hypergraph is denoted by H=(V,E). H is called a k-uniform hypergraph if every edge in E consists of exactly k vertices. P is a hypergraph packing if it is a subset of edges in H such that there is no pair of distinct edges with a common vertex. H is a (D_0,\\\\epsilon)-good hypergraph if there exists a D_0 such that for all x,y \\\\in V and D\\\\geq D_0 and both of the following conditions hold. : D(1-\\\\epsilon)\\\\leq \\\\text{deg}(x)\\\\leq D(1+\\\\epsilon) : \\\\text{codeg}(x,y)\\\\leq \\\\epsilon D where the degree deg(x) of a vertex x is the number of edges that contain x and the codegree codeg(x, y) of two distinct vertices x and y is the number of edges that contain both vertices. Theorem There exists an asymptotic packing P of size at least \\\\frac{n}{K+1}(1-o(1)) for a (K+1)-uniform hypergraph under the following two conditions, #All vertices have the degree of D(1+o(1)) in which D tends to infinity. #For every pair of vertices shares only o(D) common edges. where n is the total number of vertices. This result was shown by Pippenger and was later proved by Joel Spencer. To address the asymptotic hypergraph packing problem, Joel Spencer proposed a random greedy algorithm. In this algorithm, a branching process is used as the basis and it was shown that it almost always achieves an asymptotically optimal packing under the above side conditions. Asymptotic packing algorithms There are two famous algorithms for asymptotic packing of k-uniform hypergraphs: the random greedy algorithm via branching process, and the Rödl nibble. =Random greedy algorithm via branching process= Every edge E \\\\in H is independently and uniformly assigned a distinct real \\"birthtime\\" t_E \\\\in [0,D ]. The edges are taken one by one in the order of their birthtimes. The edge E is accepted and included in P if it does not overlap any previously accepted edges. Obviously, the subset P is a packing and it can be shown that its size is P=\\\\frac{n}{K+1} almost surely. To show that, let stop the process of adding new edges at time c. For an arbitrary \\\\gamma >0, pick c, D_0, \\\\epsilon such that for any (D_0,\\\\epsilon)-good hypergraph f_{x,H}(c)<\\\\gamma^2 where f_{x,H}(c) denotes the probability of vertex x survival (a vertex survives if it is not in any edges in P) until time c. Obviously, in such a situation the expected number of x surviving at time c is less than \\\\gamma^2 n. As a result, the probability of x surviving being less than \\\\gamma n is higher than 1-\\\\gamma. In other words, P_c must include at least (1-\\\\gamma)n vertices which means that P\\\\geq (1-\\\\gamma)\\\\frac{n}{K+1}. To complete the proof, it must be shown that \\\\lim_{c\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\lim_{x,H} f_{x,H}(c)=0. For that, the asymptotic behavior of x surviving is modeled by a continuous branching process. Fix c>0 and begin with Eve with the birthdate of c. Assume time goes backward so Eve gives birth in the interval of [0,c) with a unit density Poisson distribution. The probability of Eve having k birth is \\\\frac{e^{-c}c^k}{k!}. By conditioning on k the birthtimes x_1,...,x_k are independently and uniformly distributed on [0,c). Every birth given by Eve consists of Q offspring all with the same birth time say a. The process is iterated for each offspring. It can be shown that for all \\\\epsilon >0 there exists a K so that with a probability higher than (1-\\\\epsilon), Eve has at most K descendants. A rooted tree with the notions of parent, child, root, birthorder and wombmate shall be called a broodtree. Given a finite broodtree T we say for each vertex that it survives or dies. A childless vertex survives. A vertex dies if and only if it has at least one brood all of whom survive. Let f(c) denote the probability that Eve survives in the broodtree T given by the above process. The objective is to show \\\\lim_{c\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} f(c)=0 and then for any fixed c, it can be shown that \\\\lim^* f_{x,H}(c)=f(c). These two relations complete our argument. To show f(c)=0, let c\\\\geq 0, \\\\Delta c>0. For \\\\Delta c small, f(c+\\\\Delta c)-f(c) \\\\approx -(\\\\Delta c)f(c)^{Q+1} as, roughly, an Eve starting at time c+\\\\Delta c might have a birth in time interval [c, c+\\\\Delta c) all of whose children survive while Eve has no births in [0, c) all of whose children survive. Letting \\\\Delta c\\\\rightarrow 0 yields the differential equation f'(c)=-f(c)^{Q+1}. The initial value f(0)=1 gives a unique solution f(c)=(1+Qc)^{-1/Q}. Note that indeed \\\\lim_{c\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} f(c)=0. To prove \\\\lim^* f_{x,H}(c)=f(c), consider a proceture we call History which either aborts or produces a broodtree. History contains a set T of vertices, initially T=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}. T will have a broodtree structure with x the root. The y\\\\in T are either processed or unprocessed, x is initially unprocessed. To each y\\\\in T is assigned a birthtime t_y, we initialize t_x=c. History is to take an unprocessed y\\\\in T and process it as follows. For the value of all t_E with y\\\\in E but with no x\\\\in E that has already been processed, if either some E has t_E and y,z\\\\in E with z\\\\in T or some E, E' have t_E,t_{E'} with y\\\\in E,E' and E\\\\cup E'>1, then History is aborted. Otherwise for each E with t_E add all z\\\\in E-\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\} to T as wombmates with parent y and common birthdate t_E. Now y is considered processed. History halts, if not aborted, when all y\\\\in T are processed. If History does not abort then root x survives broodtree T if and only if x survives at time c. For a fixed broodtree, let f(T,c) denote the probability that the branching process yields broodtree T. Then the probability that History does not abort is f(T,c). By the finiteness of the branching process, \\\\sum f(T,c)=1, the summation over all broodtrees T and History does not abort. The lim^* distribution of its broodtree approaches the branching process distribution. Thus \\\\lim^* f_{x,H}(c)=f(c). The Rödl nibble In 1985, Rödl proved Paul Erdős’s conjecture by a method called the Rödl nibble. Rödl's result can be formulated in form of either packing or covering problem. For 2\\\\leq l the covering number denoted by M(n,k,l) shows the minimal size of a family \\\\kappa of k-element subsets of \\\\\\\\{1,...,n\\\\\\\\} which have the property that every l-element set is contained in at least one A \\\\in \\\\kappa. Paul Erdős et al. conjecture was :\\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{M(n,k,l)}{{n \\\\choose l}/{k \\\\choose l}}=1. where 2\\\\leq l. This conjecture roughly means that a tactical configuration is asymptotically achievable. One may similarly define the packing number m(n,k,l) as the maximal size of a family \\\\kappa of k-element subsets of \\\\\\\\{1,...,n\\\\\\\\} having the property that every l-element set is contained in at most one A \\\\in \\\\kappa. Packing under the stronger condition In 1997, Noga Alon, Jeong Han Kim, and Joel Spencer also supply a good bound for \\\\gamma under the stronger codegree condition that every distinct pair v, v'\\\\in V has at most one edge in common. For a k-uniform, D-regular hypergraph on n vertices, if k > 3, there exists a packing P covering all vertices but at most O(nD^{-1/(k-1)}). If k = 3 there exists a packing P covering all vertices but at most O(nD^{-1/2}\\\\ln^{3/2}D). This bound is desirable in various applications, such as Steiner triple system. A Steiner Triple System is a 3-uniform, simple hypergraph in which every pair of vertices is contained in precisely one edge. Since a Steiner Triple System is clearly d=(n-1)/2-regular, the above bound supplies the following asymptotic improvement. Any Steiner Triple System on n vertices contains a packing covering all vertices but at most O(n^{1/2}\\\\ln^{3/2}n).

Puthuponnani’s promontory, where the Canoli Canal meets the Arabian Sea, is place for people to relax and enjoy the sunset. Veliyankode is a nearby place. Culture Puthuponnani village is a predominantly Muslim populated area. Hindus exist in comparatively smaller numbers. So the culture of the locality is based upon Muslim traditions. Duff Muttu, Kolkali and Aravanamuttu are common folk arts of this locality. There are many libraries attached to mosques giving a rich source of Islamic studies. Most of the books are written in Arabi-Malayalam which is a version of the Malayalam language written in Arabic script. People gather in mosques for the evening prayer and continue to sit there after the prayers discussing social and cultural issues. Business and family issues are also sorted out during these evening meetings. The Hindu minority of this area keeps their rich traditions by celebrating various festivals in their temples. Hindu rituals are done here with a regular devotion like other parts of Kerala. Transportation Puthuponnani village connects to other parts of India through Kuttippuram town.

By 1884 the Ottomans had established a mayor and town council in Gharyan. It was considered the center of Libyan resistance against the Italian invasion in the early 20th century. =2011 Libyan Civil War= In early 2011, the city became involved in the nationwide anti-Gaddafi uprising. Initially successful, on 2 March, government forces retook it. In April, rebels succeeded in occupying several nearby towns and establishing a second territory on the focal town and the first town demonstrate their will against regime on the 16 Feb. ZENTAIN Libya besides Misrata that is no longer under the control of the Gaddafi forces, but as of late June the rebels had still failed to take Gharyan. On 13 August 2011, the rebel forces in Libya initiated a new battle for control of the city and were in control within two days. =Second Libyan Civil War= On April 4, 2019, the city fell to forces loyal to Tobruk-based General Khalifa Haftar as part of a wider Libyan National Army (LNA) offensive in western Libya.Libyan strongman orders troops to march on Tripoli In late June, the city was recaptured from the LNA in a counteroffensive by forces of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord, aided in their efforts by collaborating citizens of the city mobilizing against the LNA forces. The LNA restarted the offensive in June 2020. Lady of Gharyan Just west of Gharyan, there is a primitive road to the right, which provides a bumpy trip to a derelict former Italian barracks, a relic of World War II. There is a crumbling building at the camp. Painted on the bricks of one of the walls inside the building is an enormous (c.4m by 10m) representation of a naked woman, lying on her side, American pin-up style.(picture) The upper torso of the woman is shaped as an inaccurate representation of the North Africa coast, and the salient points of her anatomy are marked with names of North African towns. The \\"Lady of Garian\\" was drawn by Clifford Saber,Clifford Saber's history and portfolio is at \\"Sketchbook of a Desert Rat\\", American Field Service a volunteer American ambulance driver with the British 8th Army. Saber created the mural to help boost the morale of his fellow servicemen, finishing on 2 March 1943, while his unit was housed for a few days at the barracks in Gharyan. Climate Gharyan experiences a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh), with blazing summers and cool winters; its winters being one of the coldest in Libya. Due to its winter months being relatively 5º degrees colder than Tripoli, the locality sees a cooler variation of said climate, though its higher elevation also meant that the town gets a dozen millimetres more precipitation then Libya's capital city.  Transport  In the 1920s, the Italians built a long railway between Tripoli and a village near Gharyan that was destroyed by the British during World War II.Le ferrovie nell'Africa italiana: aspetti economici, sociali e strategici (in Italian)  Economy  Thanks to its mountainous climate (considerably more moderate compared to the rest of Libya), figs are grown for local consumption, with olives and saffron, for both local use and export.

The blog's appearance coincided with the start of the 2009 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament. History Originally, the blogger wrote anonymously, widely believed to be a member of the IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). The blog was controversial from the start, giving unflattering nicknames to players, coaches, and owners of KKR and other teams, telling sordid stories, and showing most of them in a very negative light. As the blog rapidly became popular, it was believed to be of a fringe KKR player who was upset at not being part of the core team. The blog worsened an already bad season for KKR, which lost most of their games, had controversies surrounding their coach, John Buchanan, and frequently changed captains, including Sourav Ganguly. The 2009 IPL season took place in South Africa, and two KKR players, Aakash Chopra and Sanjay Bangar, were sent home to India midway through the tournament. This fuelled speculation that they were suspected of being the person behind the blog. The team was also rumoured to have banned use of laptops by players. The management of the team termed the blog as \\"poison pen writing of the dirtiest variety\\", while denying it could have been written by an actual player. The blogger posted a disclaimer saying \\"All characters appearing in this work (blog) are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental and unintentional.\\" Unmasking In August 2010, Bangalore based marketing specialist Anupam Mukerji revealed himself on television and newspapers as the person writing the blog. He said he had \\"never met a cricketer in his life\\", and was just making up stories. He never expected it to become this big, he remarked, adding that the Fake Player ended up getting legitimised by the media frenzy. He said he was inspired by the popularity of a similar blog by Fake Steve Jobs, and the Richard Gere movie The Hoax. He continues to write a weekly column as the Fake IPL Player for Mirror, a Times of India tabloid in Mumbai and Bangalore. In 2011, Anupam started Pitch Invasion, an online radio station that claims to provide live cricket commentary with a twist. Popularity During the IPL season, the blog was very popular in India and Sri Lanka and among major cricketing nations, most of whose players and coaches were involved in the league. According to Mumbai-based digital marketing firm, Pinstorm, the Fake IPL Player blog had at its peak, on 26 April, 150,000 visitors, who each spent 15 minutes on the site, adding up to about 37,000 hours spent on the blog in one day, putting it up there with popular individual-led blogs such as Aamir Khan’s blog at its peak with about 170,000 visitors. The blogger said in an email interview to a newspaper that the key reason behind such wild popularity was the blog's \\"audacity\\", and that \\"the mainstream media needs to realise that getting ex-cricketers to write about a match that happened the previous day, which has already been dissected to death on TV and the internet, isn’t of interest to sports readers anymore.\\" Related worksThe Gamechangers= In March 2010 Fake IPL Player released a book called 'The Gamechangers' in India, coinciding with the third season of IPL, and loosely based on the contents of his blogs. This was before he had revealed his identity in August 2010. The book, which has been positioned as fiction written anonymously, covers 35 days of the Indian Bollywood League (IBL). The book describes the powerplays and machinations that go on behind the scenes of \\"megabucks\\" cricket. The central plot of the book is the chase to unmask a treacherous anonymous blogger who is upsetting the IPL. And through this story, FIP supposedly exposes cricket's dark underbelly. Critical reviews of the book were polarised with some praising it and some others criticising the book and its purpose. The 7 June 2010 issue of India Today put The Gamechangers at No. 9 in the list of Top 10 national best- sellers.India Today, 1 June 2010 issue =Pitch Invasion= In April 2011, Anupam Mukerji started an online radio station called Pitch Invasion. Pitch Invasion claims to provide irreverent, wacky and interactive live cricket commentary on the web. Anupam also acts as the main station host. In April 2013, Anupam launched Scoryboard, a live cricket web app, under the Pitch Invasion banner as reported here by Agency FAQs. In October, they launched Scoryboard's F1 version as reported.

Divine punishment was inflicted through the goddess Hathor, with the survivors suffering through separation from Ra, who now resided in the sky on the back of Nut, the heavenly cow. With this \\"fall\\", suffering and death came into the world, along with a fracture in the original unity of creation. The supreme god now changes into many heavenly bodies, creates the \\"Fields of Paradise\\" for the blessed dead, perhaps appoints Geb as his heir, hands over the rule of humankind to Osiris (Thoth ruling the night sky as his deputy), with Shu and the Heh gods now supporting the sky goddess Nut. Though the text is recorded in the New Kingdom period, it is written in Middle Egyptian and may have been written during the Middle Kingdom period. Description The Book of the Heavenly Cow appears on the walls of the tombs of Seti I, Ramesses II, Ramesses III, Ramesses VI, and Tutankhamun. The Book of the Heavenly Cow was first discovered in the outermost gilded shrine of Tutankhamun; however, the ancient text was incomplete. Three complete versions of the ancient text were discovered, in the tombs of Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses III. Each version of the texts was found in a subsidiary room of the sarcophagus chamber exclusively designed for the Book of the Heavenly Cow. Ramesses VI did not have a subsidiary room. He had a shorter description of the Book of the Heavenly Cow, written on a papyrus from the Ramesside period, now in Turin. Origins The book may have originated from the Pyramid Texts dawn myth accounts, but by the New Kingdom the idea was developed to explain death and suffering in an imperfect creation. The work has been viewed as a form of theodicy and a magical text to ensure the king's ascent into heaven. It has also been viewed as thematically similar to more developed accounts of the destruction of humanity in the Mesopotamian and biblical stories of the flood. The reign of Akhenaten – the pharaoh who had attempted to bring about a break in the existent religious traditions – may be the inspiration for the work. Content The Book of the Heavenly Cow is divided in half by the image of the cow and her supporters. There are no visible breaks in the actual text of The Heavenly Cow, aside from the representation of the Heavenly Cow. Due to this presentation method, there are no clear breaks in the text that allow for a clear structuring of the text. However, Egyptologists who examined the text closely suggested a loose division of the text into four sections. The first section describes the \\"Destruction of Mankind\\", in which humanity plot against the Sun God Ra. After Ra consulting with the other gods, the goddess Hathor is chosen by Ra, to act as the violent Eye of Ra. She was to deliver divine punishment to humanity and did so by slaughtering the rebels and bringing death into the world. The survivors of Hathor’s wrath were saved when Ra tricks Hathor by putting dyed beer that resembled blood, which Hathor drinks, becoming intoxicated. The final part of the text deals with Ra's ascension into the sky, the creation of the underworld, and with the theology surrounding the ba (soul).7 The structure of the ancient Egyptian text the Book of the Heavenly Cow is structured into 330 verses, with half of the text occurring before a description or representation of the Heavenly Cow. The language used in the Book of the Heavenly Cow displays roots from Late Egyptian influences. Due to the ancient text containing roots from Late Egypt, it is widely believed among Egyptology scholars that the Book of the Heavenly Cow originated during the Amarna period. The text has three images: # The goddess Nut (in the form of a cow) being supported by the eight Heh gods # Neneh (left) and Djet (right) as supporters of the sky # Pharaoh as supporter of the sky Publication With the discovery of the Book of the Heavenly Cow, there have been many publications over the years discussing the contents of the ancient text. In 1876, Édouard Naville published English and French translations of the version of the Book of the Heavenly Cow from Seti I's tomb in 1876. It detailed the contents of the ancient text as well as gave much insight into the Book of the Heavenly Cow. With the discovery of the text in Ramesses III others published many books regarding the Book of the Heavenly Cow. In 1881 Heinrich published a German-language version (the first of its kind). This version of the book translated the contents of the Book of the Heavenly Cow into German with insight into the overall ancient text. Alexandre Piankoff in 1955 published one of the first translations of the Book of the Heavenly Cow which heavily detailed the creation narrative and Erik Hornung in 1983 did the same thing but in more detail. Charles Mayster’s, Alexander Piankoff’s, Erik Hornung’s translations all go over The Book of the Heavenly Cow in detail. They all include the original text pictures and include explanations of the ancient text. Other contributors to publications regarding the Book of the Heavenly Cow is Antonio Loprieno and James P. Allen. Loprieno’s published Ancient Egyptian Literature in 1996. His book consists of about twenty contributions by Egyptologists as they define literary discourse. It is mainly devoted to the history and genres that include linguistics, stylistic features, and many images of Ancient Egypt. The section that specifically deals with the Book of the Heavenly Cow is the Myth and Narrative section. It goes into detail about what a narrative is as well as how myth’s influence them. James P. Allens’s book Genesis In Egypt: The Philosophy of Ancient Egyptian Creation Accounts, published in 1988, consists of thousands of texts that discuss the cosmology and cosmogony of Ancient Egypt. It sheds light on a question that plagued the minds of Egyptologists for years the origins of the world (which the section of the heavenly cow deals with). Anthony Spalinger in 2000 published his translations of the Book of the Heavenly Cow that heavily went into detail regarding The Book of the Heavenly Cow as a myth text as well as the time period it originated in.

Steven Hyden of The Post Crescent wrote of the eccentric debut \\"the music straddles the line between melody and abrasiveness\\".Post Crescent article by Steven Hyden The core group on Pleasures consisted of Marc Golde on Hammond B3, Greg Thiel on drums and percussion, and Hawkinson playing guitar and bass on many of the tracks as well as providing all the vocals. Several Wisconsin musicians made guest appearances on the recordings, including bassist Jason Brown (formerly of Hank Williams III), saxophonist Steve Cooper, drummer Eric Harkoff, and Danny Jerabek on accordion. Pleasures of Schizoprenia combined many different genres of music, from rock (\\"Divided by Zero\\") to funk (\\"Celebrate Yourself\\") to Tom Waits-style croonings (\\"No One Will Find Us\\", \\"Valentine Jesus\\") to gothic stylings that would be further shaped into a more consistent sound in the band's later recordings (\\"Vardoulacha\\", \\"Tangier\\"). The second CD release, Memoirs of Don Juan Gacy, was released in January 2008. The album again included the collaboration of Hawkinson, Golde, and Thiel, with Ken Rodgers joining the fold on bass guitar. Memoirs is notable for the inclusion of a cover of Peter Gabriel's \\"Games Without Frontiers\\", which managed to catch the attention of Italian author and Dusk (Genesis fanzine) contributor Mario Giametti. Also notable is \\"Tangier, Part II\\", a continuation (or perhaps reinvention) of the William S.

The microprocessor was also known as EV8 or Araña, the latter being its code-name. Slated for a 2004 release, it was canceled on 25 June 2001 when Compaq announced that Alpha would be phased out in favor of Itanium by 2004. When it was canceled, the Alpha 21464 was at a late stage of development but had not been taped out. The 21464's origins began in the mid-1990s when computer scientist Joel Emer was inspired by Dean Tullsen's research into simultaneous multithreading (SMT) at the University of Washington. Emer had researched the technology in the late 1990s and began to promote it once he was convinced of its value. Compaq made the announcement that the next Alpha microprocessor would use SMT in October 1999 at Microprocessor Forum 1999. At that time, it was expected that systems using the Alpha 21464 would ship in 2003. Description The microprocessor was an eight-issue superscalar design with out-of-order execution, four-way SMT and a deep pipeline. It fetches 16 instructions from a 64 KB two-way set- associative instruction cache. The branch predictor then selected the \\"good\\" instructions and entered them into a collapsing buffer. (This allowed for a fetch bandwidth of up to 16 instructions per cycle, depending on the taken branch density.) The front-end had significantly more stages than previous Alpha implementation and as a result, the 21464 had a significant minimum branch misprediction penalty of 14 cycles. The microprocessor used an advanced branch prediction algorithm to minimize these costly penalties. Implementing SMT required the replication of certain resources such as the program counter. Instead of one program counter, there were four program counters, one for each thread. However, very little logic after the front-end needed to be expanded for SMT support. The register file contained 512 entries, but its size was determined by the maximum number of in-flight instructions, not SMT. Access to the register file required three pipeline stages due to the physical size of the circuit. Up to eight instructions from four threads could be dispatched to eight integer and four floating-point execution units every cycle. The 21464 had a 64 KB data cache (Dcache), organized as eight banks to support dual- porting. This was backed by an on-die 3 MB, six-way set-associative unified secondary cache (Scache). The integer execution unit made use of a new structure: the register cache. The register cache was not meant to mitigate the three tick register file latency (as some reports have claimed), but to reduce the complexity of operand bypass management. The register cache held all the results produced by the ALU and Load pipes for the previous N cycles. (N was something like 8.) The register cache structure was an architectural relabeling of what previous processors had implemented as a distributed mux. The system interface was similar to that of the Alpha 21364. There were integrated memory controllers that provided ten RDRAM channels. Multiprocessing was facilitated by a router that provided links to other 21464s, and it architecturally supported 512-way multiprocessing without glue logic. It was to be implemented in a 0.125 μm (sometimes referred to as 0.13 μm) complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process with seven layers of copper interconnect, partially depleted silicon-on-insulator (PD-SOI), and low-K dielectric. The transistor count was estimated to be 250 million and die size was estimated to be 420 mm2. Tarantula Tarantula was the code-name for an extension of the Alpha architecture under consideration and a derivative of the Alpha 21464 that implemented the aforementioned extension. It was canceled while still in development, before any implementation work had started, and before the 21464 was finished. The extension was to provide Alpha with a vector processing capability. It specified thirty-two 64 by 128-bit (8,192-bit or 1 KB) vector registers, approximately 50 vector instructions, and an unspecified number of instructions for moving data to and from the vector registers. Other EV8 follow-up candidates included a multicore design with two EV8 cores and a 4.0 GHz operating frequency.

It is a demersal fish that lives on sandy and muddy bottoms in estuaries and near shore areas, at depths of up to . It reaches up to in length, and can weigh up to . Its native habitat is the Eastern Pacific, stretching from the coast of Baja California in the south to the Bering Sea in the north. English sole is an important commercial fish, primarily caught off Washington, Oregon and California. Though biomass is increasing, catches have been declining since the 1960s and are currently almost at an all-time low. The English sole is known in Spanish as platija limón, or lemon sole, a name by which it is also known in English, though the true lemon sole is a separate species, Microstomus kitt. Etymology The genus name is derived from the Greek para, meaning \\"near\\", ophrys, meaning \\"eyebrow\\", and the species name vetulus is a word meaning \\"old man\\". Description The English sole is a right-eyed flatfish with a compressed, diamond-shaped body and a small head with a pointed snout and small, asymmetric mouth. The upper surface is covered in rough scales and is usually uniformly brown, but occasionally speckled; the lower surface is smooth, and white to pale yellow in colour. The dorsal and ventral fin edges are dark. The lateral line is mostly straight, but curves slightly around the pectoral fin. Diet The English sole's diet consists of zoobenthos organisms, primarily marine worms, molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms. English sole feed by day, using both sight and smell, and often dig for food. Commercial fishing The English sole is an important commercial fish, and has been fished in the Eastern Pacific, almost exclusively by trawler, since 1876. Two fisheries exist: one on the West Coast of the United States, off Washington, Oregon and California, and one in the Bering Sea off Alaska. The majority of English sole landed is from the West Coast fishery. Although biomass is increasing, catches have been steadily decreasing since the 1960s — though catches peaked in the southern area in 1929 with landed, and in the north in 1949 at — and have today almost reached a historical low. This decline is estimated to be due to a combination of market factors and management restrictions placed on fishing trawlers in order to protect other bottom-dwelling species.

Control of Jojawar, provides the access route to Mewar. Its fertile land provided access to rich revenue. There have been numerous battles fought near this town, and it continued till last century for its control. Jojawar was traditionally jagir of Solanki Rajputs, who are offshoot of Roopnagar. Thakur Askaran was given the Thikana of Jojawar by his father Thakur Sawant Singh of Desuri.

That was a failure since most of them ended up in gulags or were otherwise killed by the communist regime. =Pius XII= Pius XII's pontificate faced extraordinary problems. In the 1930s, the public protests and condemnations of his predecessors had not deterred Soviet authorities from persecuting all Christian churches as hostile to Marxism–Leninism. The persecution of the Catholic Church was a part of an overall attempt to eradicate religion in the Soviet Union. In 1940, after Germany had occupied western of Poland, the Soviet Union annexed eastern of Poland, along with the Baltic countries, including the predominantly-Catholic Lithuania. Two months after his election on May 12, 1939, in Singolari Animi, a papal letter to the Sacred Congregation of the Oriental Church, Pius XII reported again the persecutions of the Catholic faith in the Soviet Union. Three weeks later, while he was honouring the memory of Saint Vladimir on the 950th anniversary of his baptism, he welcomed Ruthenian priests and bishops and members of the Russian colony in Rome, prayed for those who suffer in their country and awaited with their tears the hour of the coming of the Lord. Persecution began at once, as large parts of Poland and the Baltic States were incorporated into the Soviet Union. Almost immediately, the United Catholic Churches of Armenia, Ukraine and Ruthenia were attacked. While most Oriental Christians belong to an Orthodox Church, some, such as the Armenian Catholic Church, Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church, are united with Rome, which allowed them to keep their own Oriental liturgy and Church laws. After World War II, the Russian Orthodox Church was given some freedom by the government of Joseph Stalin but not the Orthodox Oriental Churches, united with Rome. Leaders of the Orthodox Oriental Churches faced intense pressure to break with Rome and to unite with Moscow. Pope Pius addressed specifically the Ruthenian Catholic Church in Ukraine. The encyclical Orientales omnes Ecclesias is a summary of the relations between the Eastern churches and Rome until the persecutions in 1945.Giovannetti, 112 Some Ruthenians, resisting Polonisation, felt deserted by the Vatican and returned to the Russian Orthodox Church during Pius XI's pontificate. Dialogue: 1958 to 1978John XXIII= The brief papacy of John XXIII had attempts to reconcile with the Russian Orthodox Church in the hope of reducing tensions with the Soviet Union and contributing to peace in the world. The Second Vatican Council did not condemn Communism or even mention it in what some have called a secret agreement between the Holy See and the Soviet Union. In Pacem in terris, John XXIII also sought to prevent nuclear war and tried to improve relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. He began a policy of dialogue with Soviet leaders to seek conditions in which Eastern Catholics could find relief from persecution.Dennis J. Dunn, \\"The Vatican's Ostpolitik: Past and Present.\\" Journal of International Affairs (1982) 36#2 : 247-255. online =Paul VI= Pope Paul VI continued John XXIII's policy of dialogue with Soviet leaders to reduce persecutions against local Christians. His policy has been called Ostpolitik because it closely resembled similar policies that were being adopted by some nations of Western Europe such as West Germany. He received Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Nikolai Podgorny in 1966 and 1967 in the Vatican. John Paul II and Soviet collapse: 1978 to 1991 John Paul II has long been credited with being instrumental in bringing down communism in Catholic Eastern Europe by being the spiritual inspiration behind its downfall and a catalyst for peaceful revolution in Poland. In February 2004, the Pope was even nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize to honor his life's work in opposing communism and in helping to reshape the world after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, there has been much debate among historians on the realistic significance of John Paul II's opposition to communism in the Soviet regime's eventual fall. While most scholars agree that his intervention was influential in ending the Polish Communist Party's rule, there is much disagreement in his role in the collapse of the Soviet Union. Historians differ also on their opinions on the significance of the influence of John Paul II, as opposed to that of other economic and political factors. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the relative importance of John Paul II's role in the collapse of Eastern European communism by analyzing the historical events from his election to the papacy in 1978 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. On October 16, 1978, Karol Wojtyla was elected to the papacy. As the first-ever Polish pope and the first non-Italian to be elected to the papacy in over four centuries, his election came as somewhat of a surprise to many Catholic scholars worldwide. Wojtyla chose to take the name John Paul II, after his predecessor, John Paul I, who was pope for barely a month before his death on September 29, 1978. Religious and political leaders alike wondered what it would mean for a citizen of a communist country to become pope. Poles, on the other hand, rejoiced at the news.Constantine Pleshakov, There Is No Freedom Without Bread! 1989 and the Civil War That Brought Down Communism, (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2009), 82–85. Having lived under both the Nazi and the Soviet regimes, the new pope was unwavering in his opposition to both fascism and communism. While the Vatican had always officially opposed communism because of its atheism, Pope John Paul II lost no time in making his theological opposition into an active policy of confrontation. In his first encyclical, he pinpointed religious freedom as the paramount human right and argued that it was the duty of the Church to protect that right. Simultaneously, he rejected the general Cold War diplomacy of appeasement by removing or demoting Church leaders who had enacted the policy of Ostpolitik, or quiet negotiation with communist leaders.Pleshakov, 85–86. Pope John Paul II spoke out publicly against communism. Despite warnings from Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, not to interfere in Poland, the new pope visited his homeland within the first year of his papacy. On June 2, 1979, John Paul II made his first papal visit to Poland, and three million people came to the capital to greet him.Pleshakov, pp. 86–87. The pope held Mass publicly in the Victory Square, Warsaw, which was usually reserved for state-sponsored events. In the Lenin Shipyard, John Paul II held Mass in memory of the Polish workers who had been killed in a 1970 strike and carried a large wooden cross which some took to symbolize the burden of communism on the Polish people.Arragon Perrone, \\"Pope John Paul II’s Role in the Collapse of Poland's Communist Regime: Examining a Religious Leader's Impact on International Relations,\\" University of Connecticut (2012), http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1244&context;=srhonors_theses (accessed May 10, 2014), pp. 34–36. The historian John Lewis Gaddis identified the 1979 papal visit as the \\"trigger that led to communism's collapse worldwide\\" because of its profound effect on the morale of the Polish people.Perrone, 13. The trade Union Solidarity emerged in Poland in 1980 under the leadership of Lech Wałęsa. The emergence of the Catholic anticommunist movement has been causally linked by many historians, to Pope John Paul II's first papal visit to Poland in 1979. Indeed, John Paul II publicly defended the strikers and ordered the Polish Church to aid them in a message to Stefan Wyszyński, the archbishop of Warsaw and Gniezno.Pleshakov, 103-07. Most previous Polish revolutionary movements had been secular in nature, but Solidarity centred on the religious symbols of the cross, the rosary, and the Madonna.Pleshakov, 110. In January 1981, Walesa visited Rome, met with the pope for the first time and received his official recognition and support.Pleshakov, 112. On May 13, 1981 in St. Peter's Square, Pope John Paul II was shot four times, hitting him in the abdomen and his left hand, by would-be-assassin Mehmet Ali Agca. Many scholars have claimed that the assassination attempt was part of a conspiracy by the Soviet Union, but that theory has never been proved. If true, the assassination attempt would reveal Soviet fears of the Pope's influence in the Eastern Bloc and his assistance in the Polish Solidarity movement. However, the pope survived.Perrone, 36–37. Initially, the Polish communists resisted the Solidarity rebels and imprisoned many of the movement's leaders between 1981 and 1983, but over the course of the 1980s, the movement gained more power and thus more legitimacy. Consequently, in 1989, round-table talks were held between the leaders of Solidarity, the Soviet Communists and the Catholic Church. In 1990, Walesa was elected president of Poland and began large-scale market reforms. By 1992, Soviet troops had begun to leave Poland.BBC News, \\"Poland Timeline.\\" Last modified January 18, 2012. Accessed May 10, 2014. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1054724.stm. That trend was paralleled by demonstrations and revolts in several other Soviet-controlled states. There has been much speculation by historians about the relationship between Pope John Paul II and US President Ronald Reagan.Perrone, 14–15. Both leaders kept up a regular letter correspondence and met in Rome in June 1982 and in June 1987. That interaction has caused many historians to believe that both leaders' co-operation strengthened the anticommunist cause.Perrone, 15. However, other historians, like George Weigel, have argued that both men were able to make their own individual political achievements. According to that view, the United States, under the leadership of Reagan, presented an economic challenge to the Soviet Union, which was entirely independent of Vatican influence.Perrone, pp. 14–16. Therefore, Reagan's role in the collapse of the Soviet economy may have been more influential than that of Pope John Paul II. On December 1, 1989, the pope met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. It was the first time that a Catholic pope had met with a Soviet leader. Both leaders agreed to establish diplomatic relations between the Vatican and the Soviet Union. Gorbachev also pledged to allow greater religious freedom within the Soviet Union. Many saw the meeting as a symbolic end to the philosophical conflict between the Soviet Union and the Vatican.Haberman, Clyde. \\"THE KREMLIN AND THE VATICAN; GORBACHEV VISITS POPE AT VATICAN; TIES ARE FORGED.\\" New York Times, December 2, 1989. It certainly showed a growing willingness on both sides to co-operate. Even though the pope was primarily a religious leader, his leadership also had significant political consequences.Perrone, 16. John Paul II clearly used his Polish identity and connections to bring about the collapse of the nation's communist regime.Perrone, 17. While the intervention of Pope John Paul II was undoubtedly an essential factor in the ending of communism in Poland, how significant the pope's leadership was in the rest of Eastern Europe and within the Soviet Union itself is less clear. The efforts of anti-communist leaders, such as Pope John Paul II and US President Ronald Reagan did not make the fall of the Soviet Union inevitable. However, both leaders hastened the end of the Cold War and the fall of communism, particularly in Eastern Europe.Perrone, 18.

Today, eight ancient Egyptian obelisks stand in Rome, though not in their original places. The first of the obelisks, the 263-ton Flaminian obelisk, was transported from Heliopolis – modern-day Cairo – in 10 BCE. while the last, the 500-ton Lateran obelisk, was transported from Karnak. Descriptions There are only two recorded texts describing the ships that transported the obelisks from Egypt across the Mediterranean to Rome. The first recorded text is from Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE), who described the great ships that transported the Vatican obelisk in 40 CE under the emperor Caligula. The second description comes from Ammianus Marcellinus (330–393 CE), who describes the ships that transported the Lateran obelisk in 357 CE. Destruction of ships There is little evidence of the great ships that carried the large obelisks across the Mediterranean. One of the two ships that carried the Vatican obelisk was purposely sunk by the emperor Claudius to build the Portus harbor; the other burned down during Caligula’s reign (36–41 CE) while on display at the Puteoli harbor. Naval architecture The evidence that is known suggests that ships were built similar to the Egyptian ships depicted in Pharaoh Unas’s tomb in Saqqara. The depictions show two ships that carry the obelisk underwater between them. Three Roman ships were built to transport one obelisk. The two aft ships were of rectangular shape; they were 37 meters in length and 5 meters in width. The two ships were held together by longitudinal beams, while the obelisk was tied to these longitudinal beams and held stationary underwater. The third ship, a larger trireme, was in the front and was tied to the two larger ships carrying the obelisk. The third ship’s purpose was to help steer the two aft ships and have rowers and sail power the ship across the Mediterranean.

More than 90 international, national and regional scientific organisations constitute IBRO’s Governing Council which, together with the five IBRO Regional Committees, address the needs and advance the work of individual scientists and research communities everywhere. In addition, IBRO has partnerships with like-minded scientific societies and organizations to identify priorities and help bridge gaps in knowledge, investment and resources in the field of brain research. History IBRO was founded in 1961 in response to the growing demand from neuroscientists around the world for the creation of a central organization that would cut across world boundaries and improve communication and collaboration among brain researchers. The origin of IBRO can be traced back to a meeting of electroencephalographers in London in 1947, which led to the establishment of an International Federation of EEG and Clinical Neurophysiology. A later conference in Moscow in 1958 of IFEEG and other groups, successfully achieved unanimous support for a resolution proposing the creation of an international organization representing brain research worldwide. IBRO was established as an independent, non-governmental organization, regulated by a Governing Council. The organization represents the interests of circa 75,000 neuroscientists around the globe.

The microprocessor was notable for its high clock frequency (for the time, circa 1997) in the range of 400 to 533 MHz, its use of bipolar transistors for logic and CMOS circuits for memory, and its failure to see use in an Apple Macintosh, the opposite of what industry observers such as Microprocessor Report expected. Exponential Technology eventually failed as a result of the x704's lack of success, but some of its former employees founded Intrinsity, a start-up that developed a high clock frequency MIPS implementation, FastMATH. The company has been acquired by Apple and licensed Fast14 dynamic logic to third parties such as ATI for their GPUs. The x704 was a superscalar microprocessor that issued up to three instructions per cycle to an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), floating-point unit (FPU) and branch unit. To realize the short cycle times, the caches were kept small, limiting its performance. There are three levels of cache. The first consisted of separate 2 KB instruction and data caches. These were direct-mapped. The L2 cache was on-die and was 32 KB large. It is eight-way set set-associative. The L3 cache was larger, supporting capacities of 512 KB to 2 MB, and was located externally. The x704 contained 2.7 million transistors, of which 0.7 million were bipolar transistors and 2.0 million were metal oxide semiconductor (MOS), and measured 15 mm by 10 mm (150 mm2). It was fabricated in a 0.5 µm BiCMOS process with six levels of interconnect. It used 3.6 and 2.1 V power supplies and dissipated less than 85 W at 533 MHz. The x704 was packaged in a 356-ball ball grid array (BGA).

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on May 7, 2009. The episode was written by Peter A. Knight and series co-developer Brad Johnson, and was directed by Alex Hardcastle. The episode title is a spin on Thrilla in Manila. In \\"Thrilla in the Villa\\", Kröd and his friends battle the evil Dongalor, who has finally activated his ancient weapon, the Eye of Gulga Grymna. The episode received generally negative reviews. According to Nielsen ratings, \\"Thrilla in the Villa\\" was viewed by 858,000 households, about half the viewership the back-to-back season premiere, \\"Wench Trouble\\" and \\"Golden Powers\\", received a month earlier. Plot Kröd Mändoon (Sean Maguire) and his friends Loquasto (Steve Speirs), Zezelryck (Kevin Hart) and Bruce (Marques Ray), having survived an explosion during a secret mission, find a notice that Dongalor (Matt Lucas) has declared victory following Kröd's death and offered amnesty (and a free mule) to freedom fighters who surrender. Since the warlock Grimshank (John Rhys-Davies) was the only resistance fighter who knew of Kröd's mission, they realize he is a double agent. After seeking advice from his ex-wife Agnes Grimshank (Janine Duvitski), they learn Grimshank is powerless without the canine tooth he wears upon a waist chain. Agnes turns the foursome into dogs so they can sneak into the castle and get close to Grimshank. They arrive at his room and learn he has acquired Pagan tears, the last ingredient needed to activate Dongalor's ancient weapon, the Eye of Gulga Grymna. After spending the night in Grimshank's room and waking up as humans, Kröd and his men steal the vial of tears, throw the canine tooth out the window and tie up Grimshank. Kröd reveals to Aneka (India de Beaufort) and Ralph Longshaft (James Murray) that Grimshank is a traitor, but Grimshank insists he had to do it so that he could get close to Dongalor and stop him. Aneka is thrilled Kröd is still alive, but when Longshaft reveals that he and Aneka have been having sex, a disheartened Kröd gives him the Pagan tears, much to Grimshank's horror. Suddenly, Dongalor arrives with his army and Longshaft, who reveals himself to be the true traitor, gives him the tears. Kröd says the tears are fake and that he simply was trying to expose the real traitor, but Dongalor calls out his guards and takes the real tears from Kröd (Krod tries to swallow the vial, but ends up choking it up into Dongalor's hands: Aneka, Longshaft and Dongalor's advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) then make cutting remarks about what he could have done with the vial). An annoyed Grimshank explains he planned to give the tears to Dongalor then use his powers to turn the weapon against him, but that he is now powerless without his canine tooth and cannot help. However, Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce arrive to fend off the guards and a battle ensues. While Dongalor activates the Eye of Gulga Grymna, Kröd and Longshaft fight each other with swords. Longshaft nearly kills Kröd, but Grimshank jumps in front of the blow and dies, telling Kröd with his dying breath that he remains unconvinced Kröd is the golden one. Longshaft becomes disarmed, but Kröd can't bring himself to kill an unarmed man; when Longshaft pulls out a secret dagger and tries to stab him, Aneka throws a sai into his chest and kills him: however, Ralph \\"remains classy to the end\\". Kröd confronts Dongalor, who reveals he is Kröd's brother-in-law, having married (and divorced) Kröd's crazy estranged sister. With the Eye of Gulga Grymna about to explode, Kröd shoves Dongalor and Barnabus aside, accidentally knocking them out a window. Following advice from the disembodied voice of his deceased mentor Arcadius (Roger Allam), Kröd stabs the Eye with his flaming sword, destroying it. Aneka embraces Kröd, although a voice-over narrator reveals she will continue her promiscuous ways. Dongalor and Barnabus have survived by falling into a tree, while Dongalor's bastard son, having survived his father's suicidal task (going on a fishing boat to the middle of a lake with his pockets stuffed with rocks, knowing he can't swim), pelts them with rocks, and starts chopping down the tree they're in for revenge (the cleverness of which impresses Dongalor enough for him to declare the boy his heir). Production \\"Thrilla in the Villa\\" was written by Peter A. Knight and series co-developer Brad Johnson, and was directed by Alex Hardcastle. It originally aired May 7, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. The episode was filmed in Budapest, Hungary. Reception According to Nielsen ratings, \\"Thrilla in the Villa\\" was viewed by 858,000 households in its original American broadcast. The viewership was nearly half of the back-to-back Kröd Mändoon season premiere \\"Wench Trouble\\" and \\"Golden Powers\\", which was seen by 1.6 million households on April 9, 2009. Matt Fowler of IGN said of the episode, \\"Kröd Mändoon wrapped itself up this past Thursday with about as much as a half-hearted attempt at humor and adventure as we've already witnessed throughout the season. It just wasn't that funny.\\" Although he said the twist of making Longshaft the traitor was good, he said the episode ends abruptly, the resolution with Kröd and Aneka's relationship was unsatisfying and that practically all the jokes were unfunny, with the exception of Grimshank's dying words to Kröd: \\"I die unconvinced.\\" Fowler was particularly critical of the scene in which Kröd and his fellow warriors became dogs.

The inscription on the memorial has been damaged and is barely legible today. The inscription reads:  History  The Battle of Dutton's Hill took place on March 30, 1863. It was the culmination of Confederate General John Pegram's expedition into Kentucky. The 9-day foray into the Commonwealth was for the purpose of gathering beef — cattle to feed the Army of Tennessee. Pegram led approximately 1,550 cavalry supported by a three piece battery of artillery across the Cumberland River at Stigall's Ferry on March 22. The Confederate column consisted of the 1st Louisiana, 1st Georgia, 1st and 2nd Tennessee Regiments, 16th Battalion Tennessee Cavalry (less two companies left behind in Tennessee), 1st Florida Cavalry (3 mounted companies), and Huwald's Tennessee Battery of mule-drawn mountain howitzers. By making an orderly march through Somerset, the populace was led to believe that Pegram was leading the forefront of a Confederate invasion of central Kentucky. Rumors flew as to the actual strength of Pegram's command. While foraging for cattle, Pegram's cavalry encountered Yankees on March 28 at Hickman's Bridge. Then, narrowly evading the closely following 44th and 45th Regiments Ohio Infantry, they continued to rustle cattle until they had rounded up about 750. Braxton Bragg was relying on beef to keep the Army of Tennessee supplied with nourishing food. Pegram's cavalry had herded 537 of the cattle across the Cumberland River when their luck ran out. On March 30, 1863, about 1 miles from Somerset in Pulaski County, Kentucky, Pegram's cavalry was overtaken by a Union force of 1,250 men under the command of Brigadier General Quincy A. Gillmore. Pegram was defeated. Confederate casualty reports of the Battle of Dutton's Hill vary wildly, as to killed, wounded, or missing. General Pegram reported a rumor of 80 dead. One Union regiment reported 57 Confederates killed; another only 10.

History On March 18, 1974, four women met at the Knights of Columbus Hall to cook nourishing bread, soup, and coffee for the homeless. For the first several years, the Poverello was run by nuns, though it has since become a secular non-profit. Until 1979, the soup kitchen seemed an adequate service. That winter Patrick Todd, Director of the Poverello Center, wrote of the increasing need to shelter people \\"alone in the night with no place to go.\\" He wrote the poignant story of Humberto Roca, a man of Mexican descent who understood little English. He was on his way to visit his sister but ended up in Missoula, MT. His difficulty in walking made it apparent that he was suffering from frostbite. A subsequent visit to the local hospital resulted in amputation. The incident fueled Todd's crusade to fill the need for emergency housing. The Poverello Center emergency shelter was opened on November 18, 1981. Over the course of the last thirty years, the Poverello Center has continued to identify and meet the needs of people living in poverty in its community.

The emergency shelter is a dry facility, meaning residents must be sober in order to access night services. Clients who access the soup kitchen, food pantry, laundry and shower services during daytime hours may be able to do so under the influence barring any behavioral issues.

In the 39 years the Poverello Center has provided meals to Missoulians in need, over 2.5 million meals have been served − equivalent to 66,000 meals a year. Nearly 25% of all meals provided were in the last six years. Along with providing emergency shelter and hot meals to the community of Missoula, the Poverello Center has operated a food pantry since 1982 to further assist households in need. Nearly 140,000 food pantry requests have been fulfilled in the past 31 years. Help Build Hope Campaign After decades in an old boarding house in downtown Missoula, the Poverello Center's emergency shelter began their Help Build Hope Campaign to fund the building of a new site for its growing clientele. The recent economic downturn has put new stresses on many of the shelter's neighbors and businesses. When the boarding house on Ryman Street became the Poverello Center in 1981, 4,800 nights of shelter and 15,000 meals were provided yearly. Last year, in essentially the same facility, they provided more than 25,000 nights of shelter and served nearly 140,000 meals. Consequently, the organization is in the process of building a new facility. Ground broke in October 2013 and the new location was open in December, 2014 at 1110 W. Broadway.

O'Brien, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix. The investigation resulted in evidence of priestly abuse, including a 1979 case in which Bishop O'Brien learned of accusations that a priest had molested a 10-year-old boy and later transferred the same priest to another parish, where his abusive behavior continued. Plea agreement On June 2, 2003, O'Brien and Romley reached a plea agreement, avoiding possible criminal charges in exchange for admitting that he \\"allowed priests under his supervision to have contact with minors after becoming aware of allegations of criminal sexual misconduct\\" and acknowledging \\"transferring offending priests to situations where children could be further victimized.\\" United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, A Report on the Crisis in the Catholic Church in the United States Diminished authority The agreement vastly diminished O'Brien's authority in the diocese, forcing him to appoint a priest to oversee the Phoenix diocese's sexual abuse policies as well as an independent youth protection advocate to report allegations about priests without requiring the consent of any diocesan personnel.

The wrecks were discovered while building a riverside embankment wall along the River Thames. Marsden discovered the first on 6 September 1962 and the next two were discovered in 1970. A later discovery added to the previous three wrecks, constituting now what is known as the four Blackfriars wrecks.  Blackfriars I  Scale model of Blackfriars I Discovered by Peter Marsden on 6 September 1962, the first Blackfriars ship became the earliest known indigenous seagoing sailing ship to be found in northern Europe, dating back to the 2nd century AD. The wreck is dated to a period of great Roman expansion and construction. Found between Blackfriars Bridge and Blackfriars Railway Bridge during the construction of a new riverside wall, the Blackfriars I generated controversy since it appeared to match a native Brythonic shipbuilding style instead of a traditional Roman style. The Blackfriars I was built frame-first, meaning that the frame of the ship was built before building the rest of the ship. This method was much faster and saved wood, and was advanced for the period. Marsden described the ship as having a carvel-built hull caulked with hazel twigs, mast-step and thick floors secured with nails. On the ship, a bronze votive coin of the Emperor Domitian was found in the mast of the ship. In addition, it was discovered that the ship was wrecked while carrying cargo that consisted of of Kentish ragstone, a type of building stone. With further findings about the area of operation of the ship, Marsden suggested Blackfriars I was used for constructions purposes. The rest of the cargo included: two pottery sherds, a wooden mallet, and a piece of leather. Marsden was able to conclude, using the location and position of the wreck that it crashed into another vessel, a collision which was responsible for the ship sinking.  Blackfriars II The Blackfriars II was discovered in June 1969 east of Blackfriars Bridge. The ship was carrying a cargo of brick when it was wrecked. Marsden and R. Inman excavated the wreck. Their findings showed that the cargo included new red bricks, pipes and pottery that dated back to 1660-80\\\\. With this information, Marsden was able to conclude that the ship was carrying materials meant for rebuilding London after the Great Fire of 1666. The techniques used to build this ship led Marsden to believe that the state of contemporary knowledge of shipbuilding was insufficient for dating small boats.  Blackfriars III and IV The Blackfriars III and IV were discovered in 1970 in the riverfront extremely close to the sites of the previous two discoveries. The ships date back to 15th century. The wreck is believed to be the result of a deadly collision between the two vessels. The Blackfriars IV is believed to have collided with the Blackfriars III and sunk it. The wreck contained no cargo, but archaeologists, while excavating around the site, found two pewter badges, the bronze arm of a pair of shears, two larger lead weights, and an iron grapnel. As with the other Blackfriars ships, these two appear to have been used to carry and transport building supplies. The Blackfriars III ship is the most complete medieval sailing ship to be discovered in Britain. It was a sailing ship built around 1400 and was approximately long, wide and high. Marsden believed the ship to resemble a river vessel known as a \\"shout\\". The Blackfriars IV was a clinker-built vessel, built around the 15th century. The vessel was estimated to be very small, only wide. It was possible that it was a local river craft that was used to unload larger vessels.

On being nominated, the reticent Harlan called reporters into his chambers in New York, and stated, in full, \\"I am very deeply honored.\\" (fee for article) The United States Senate did not initially act on his nomination, and Eisenhower had to renominate Harlan on January 10. Harlan's nomination came shortly after the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional. Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, James Eastland, and several southern senators delayed his confirmation, because they (correctly) believed that he would support desegregation of the schools and civil rights.Dorsen, 2006. Unlike almost all previous Supreme Court nominees, Harlan appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions relating to his judicial views. Every Supreme Court nominee since Harlan has been questioned by the Judiciary Committee before confirmation. The Senate finally confirmed him on March 17, 1955 by a vote of 71-11.Epstein, 2005. He took his seat on March 28, 1955.Dorsen, 2002, pp. 139–143. Of the eleven senators who voted against his appointment, nine were from the South. William Brennan and Charles Evans Whittaker nominations Due to ill health, Justice Sherman Minton announced his retirement from the Court on October 15, 1956, remarking that \\"[t]here will be more interest in who will succeed me than in my passing. I'm an echo.\\"Oyez Project, Supreme Court media, Sherman Minton. Minton retired only a month before its traditional opening, and less than a month before the Presidential election of 1956, both of which rushed the process to find a replacement.Eisler, Kim Isaac, A Justice for All: William J. Brennan, Jr., and the decisions that transformed America ( New York: Simon & Schuster, 1993), p. 90. . On October 16, 1956, Eisenhower used a recess appoint to seat William Brennan. Presidential advisers thought the appointment of a Catholic Democrat from the Northeast would woo critical voters in the upcoming election for Eisenhower, a Republican. Additionally, Cardinal Francis Spellman had asked Eisenhower to appoint a Catholic to the court, as the Supreme Court had not had a Catholic justice since the death of Frank Murphy in 1949. Brennan gained the attention of Eisenhower's attorney general and chief legal affairs adviser, Herbert Brownell, when Brennan had to give a speech at a conference (as a substitute for New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Vanderbilt).Eisler, a Justice for All, page 85, . To Brownell, Brennan's speech seemed to suggest a marked conservatism, especially on criminal matters. Other factors playing into Brennan's appointment were his Catholicism, his status as a state court judge (no state judge had been appointed to the High Court since Benjamin Cardozo in 1932), and Eisenhower's desire to appear bipartisan after his appointments of justices Earl Warren and John Marshall Harlan II.Eisler, a Justice for All, page 84, . Brennan was formally nominated on January 14, 1957. Before Brennan's nomination was considered by the Congress, Justice Stanley Forman Reed announced his retirement from the Court on February 25, 1957, citing old age. Reed was 73 years old,Huston, \\"Justice Reed, 72, to Retire From the Supreme Court,\\" New York Times, February 1, 1957; \\"Justice Reed Retires From Supreme Court,\\" New York Times, February 26, 1957. but had also begun to feel that the Court's jurisprudential center had shifted too far away from him, and that he was losing his effectiveness.Fassett, New Deal Justice: The Life of Stanley Reed of Kentucky, 1994. Within a week of Reed's retirement, on March 2, 1957, Eisenhower nominated Charles Evans Whittaker to succeed Reed.\\"Federal Judge in Missouri Named to Supreme Court,\\" New York Times, March 3, 1957. Both Brennan and Whittaker were confirmed by voice vote in the United States Senate on March 19, 1957. Potter Stewart nomination Harold Hitz Burton resigned from the Court due to ill health on October 13, 1958. Five days later, on October 18, 1958, Eisenhower used a recess appointment to seat Potter Stewart on the Court. Eisenhower had previously appointed Stewart to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in 1954. Stewart was formally nominated on January 17, 1959, and was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 5, 1959, by a vote of 70–17.

Biography In his early childhood, Peter Marvey was fascinated with any form of flying, whether the flight of birds, stage \\"flying\\" or aviation. He expressed his passion by creating simple wings made of wood and textile. His parents booked a flight from Zurich to Geneva, for the exclusive reason of allowing him to \\"experience flight\\". He was also fascinated by magic. He soon became aware of his talent for this art and invested all his time and energy in it. He was caught doing finger practice under his desk at school. While still in high school, Marvey created his first illusion, a version of levitating girl. Later on he interrupted his studies to concentrate on creating illusions. Magic career Marvey studied, designed and practiced for seven years to create an illusion called \\"Dream Flying\\", which made his name in the magic business and became a signature piece. He first performed this illusion in Perpignan, France, in October 1999, for a magic convention. He later performed it live on TV in 2001. Marvey has created seven different flying illusions, as well as the Flying Coach, the Levitating Spectators, the Haunted Balloon Basket, the Flying Screen and other levitation tricks. For seven years, Peter Marvey studied, designed and practiced for his first flying illusion, “Dream Flying”. He invented a system which allowed him to turn and move while flying in more directions than had been achieved before. He made it possible to fly in bright light, for the first time in magic’s history. He was the first magician to have changed his costume in mid air, in the fraction of a second. Marvey performed “Dream Flying” the first time in Perpignan, France, in October 1999, for a magic convention. In the following years, Marvey created six further systems to achieve the same illusion for live productions, TV and special conditions. Marvey performed the flying illusion live on TV in 2001. For an exhibition event in Bremen in 2002 he developed a flying which allowed him to fly over the audience. In 2005, Peter Marvey designed a flying illusion for singer Ayumi Hamasaki. In the Saitama arena in Tokyo and later on in other stadiums, the singer appeared to fly for 60 meters, together with two dancers in a turning ball above the audience. In 2006, Marvey presented a flying illusion with dolphins for the Japanese TV channel TBS. In 2007, Marvey created the \\"Flying Coach\\" illusion for a leading indoor international horse show, the CSI Zurich.http://www.mercedes-csi.ch/index.php?en_home The floating coach was pulled by seven horses, and escorted by fairies with huge wings, all in white. About 40,000 spectators had the chance to see this illusion from all around the arena. Aside from flying illusions, Marvey has created many levitation systems. These include the levitation of spectators live on stage and floating objects which can be watched at close range. Other grand illusions in his shows include being cut in half at the waist. The legs are on a unicycle which circles the stage, disconnected from the upper body. In another illusion, he dons a Superman-like costume and appears to shorten his legs to less than half their normal length. Marvey is also a champion prestidigitator, able to make cards appear out of thin air and disappear again. In 2009 Marvey worked together with Siegfried & Roy on a special production in Las Vegas. This was the last performance of the magic duo. They presented one of Peter\`s illusions “The Fire Appearance”. Peter and his creative director Vivi Vega worked as consultants during the production. Since 2012 he created up scale illusions uniting technology and magic innovations. The premiere of the most glamorous illusion existing today “The Diamond Illusion” designed with over 2,000 LED lights and over 100 “Eiffel Tower” flash lights was presented for the Queen Silvia of Sweden and the Princess of Monaco. In 2014 he invented the Strongest Girl and in 2015 the big release of the Illuminon a double levitation took place this illusion includes multiple magic effects and never seen before magic. Other new illusions are the flying carpet (levitation with a kid from the audience), take off ( an appearance ), and the genie lamp. Achievements and awards  Marvey has won awards in several international magical competitions, where performers are judged by magic experts and prominent people from show business. Prince Albert of Monaco presented him with the Golden Wand trophy in 1996. Marvey received the Merlin Award of the International Magicians Society in 2002. He won third prize in the Grand Prix Manipulation category at the 19th world championship of the Fédération Internationale des Sociétés Magiques (FISM) in 1994 in Yokohama, Japan. In 1993, he received an award from The Society of American Magicians.http://www.magicsam.com/ He was Swiss National Champion for 1993-1995.

The Society of St. Pius X is an international organisation founded in 1970 by the French traditionalist Catholic archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. Political controversiesFrance= There is an overlap in French society between the SSPX's constituency of support and support for reactionary political positions. In the French context, such positions include: * Condemnation of the 1789 French Revolution and of the French Republic, accompanied by support for the restoration of the absolutist French monarchy. Archbishop Lefebvre vocally condemned the French Revolution, the ensuing dechristianization of France, and Reign of Terror by the Jacobin Club. The Archbishop called the Revolution's principles \\"Masonic and Anti-Catholic\\". He expressed regret that the Classical Liberalism personified by the Revolution had entered \\"mitered heads,\\" before, during, and after Vatican II. Lefebvre's close associate Fr. Paul Aulagnier, who has since left the SSPX and been reconciled with the Church hierarchy, was quoted in an SSPX periodical in 2001 as saying, while serving in Belgium (a constitutional monarchy): \\"I am pleased to be in Brussels – I who detest the republic and hate democracy.\\"\\"Je suis content d’être à Bruxelles, moi qui déteste la république et qui hais la démocratie\\" Les croisés de l’Occident chrétien. * Support for the Vichy government (1940–1944). Lefebvre spoke approvingly of the \\"Catholic order of Pétain\\", referring to the Vichy Premier Marshal Philippe Pétain, who was later convicted of treason and collaboration with Nazi Germany.Spiritual Journey (in French) The Society organises pilgrimages to Pétain's tomb,See here on the 2007 pilgrimage, with links to video footage. and during the 1987 pilgrimage the Archbishop referred to him as having \\"restored [France] spiritually and morally\\".\\"...restaurée spirituellement et moralement...\\" The Society's official journal in Belgium has denounced the anti-Vichy trials conducted after World War II by the mainstream republican followers of Charles De Gaulle.The journal is called Pour qu’Il Règne, and is quoted here The trials resulted in 791 executions and almost 50,000 forfeitures of civil rights. There have also been allegations that the SSPX had links with the Vichy functionary Paul Touvier and that Vichy songs were learned at a scout camp of the Society (see below). * Support for the Front National political party and its former leader, Jean-Marie le Pen, who is on the far right of the political spectrum.Berntson, M. , 2006-08-11 \\"National Preference, Gender Complementarity, and the Family Policy of France’s Front National\\" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, Montreal Convention Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Online . 2008-10-09 from http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p104814_index.htmlFar-right leader Le Pen hints at retirement , AFP report, 11 September 2008 In 1985, Lefebvre was quoted in the French far-right periodical Présent as endorsing Jean-Marie Le Pen, though his endorsement was made on the basis that Le Pen was the only major French politician who unambiguously condemned abortion. In 1991, the then SSPX priest Fr. Philippe Laguérie called the Front National \\"the party least removed from the natural law\\".\\"Philippe Laguérie qui établissait dès 1991 que le Front National était «le parti le moins éloigné du droit naturel»\\" (Internet Centre Anti-Racism Europe: Actualité 24/08/2005 ). Archbishop Lefebvre's first biographer, the English traditionalist writer Michael Davies, wrote in the first volume of his Apologia Pro Marcel Lefebvre: :In France political feeling tends to be more polarized, more extreme, and far more deeply felt than in England. ...Since the [Second World] war, and especially since Vatican II, the official French Church has veered sharply to the left. ...Thus, a large proportion of right-wing Catholics was predisposed to support any religious movement opposed to the policies of the French hierarchy. The political views of some of the French Catholics who support the Archbishop would certainly be odious to many English-speaking traditionalists – although such views are more understandable (if not acceptable) within the French context. However, if they wish to support the Archbishop (and not necessarily for the right reasons) there is nothing he can do about it. ...The French hierarchy has replaced [Catholic] social teaching with diluted Marxism to such an extent that anyone adopting the Catholic position is now automatically accused of fascism. Occupation of the church of St Nicolas du Chardonnet and Anti-Semitism In 1977, a group of SSPX priests and laypeople led by Monsignor François Ducaud-Bourget entered the parish church of St Nicolas du Chardonnet in central Paris and celebrated Mass. They subsequently refused to leave, and the church remains in the possession of the SSPX to this day. The various French municipal authorities have had ownership of the older churches in France since the enactment of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, though the buildings are permitted to be used by the appropriate religious denominations. Ducaud-Bourget maintained that the Traditionalist Catholics represented by the SSPX were the true heirs of the Catholics of 1905. Although the occupation was declared illegal by the French courts,\\"Le Conseil de Paris ... Emet le vœu :- que le Maire de Paris et le Préfet de police mettent tout en œuvre pour faire cesser l'occupation illégale de l'église Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet par des personnes diffusant une propagande raciste, antisémite, sexiste et antidémocratique\\" the authorities reached the conclusion that, by comparison with forcibly evicting the SSPX, the continuing occupation would cause less disturbance to public order. An SSPX attempt in 1993 to occupy another church in Paris, that of Saint- Germain-l'Auxerrois, was unsuccessful. =Bishop Richard Williamson= The views of Bishop Williamson have been a particular source of controversy. For example, the bishop has written: :However, until they re-discover their true Messianic vocation, they may be expected to continue fanatically agitating, in accordance with their false messianic vocation of Jewish world-dominion, to prepare the Anti-Christ's throne in Jerusalem. So we may fear their continuing to play their major part in the agitation of the East and in the corruption of the West. Here the wise Catholic will remember that, again, the ex-Christian nations have only their own Liberalism to blame for allowing free circulation within Christendom to the enemies of Christ.The Gulf War In an interview with Swedish Television in November 2008, whose broadcast on 21 January 2009, the date on which the Holy See lifted the excommunication of the four SSPX bishops, gained wide publicity, Williamson repeated his opinion that the generally accepted history of the Holocaust is wrong. He accepted an estimate of only 200,000-300,000 Jews who perished in Nazi concentration camps, and denied that any were killed in gas chambers. Subsequently, former SSPX seminarians have come forward with additional information about Williamson's Jewish views. One former seminarian characterized Williamson as \\"a sick man\\" with \\"a horrible attitude toward women and a horrible attitude toward Jews.\\" The Vatican has repudiated Williamson's views as \\"intolerable and altogether unacceptable.\\" Williamson's views on this and other subjects are controversial, even within traditionalist Catholicism. After his interview, broadcast by Swedish Television on 21 January 2009, both the Superior General of the SSPX, Bishop Fellay, and the District Superior of the SSPX in Germany, Fr. Franz Schmidberger, stated that Williamson's views represented his own personal opinions;Fellay's letter; Schmidberger's statement and Bishop Fellay, as superior general of the Society, \\"prohibited him, pending any new orders, from taking any public positions on political or historical questions.\\" Although the SSPX authorities have thus distinguished Williamson's views from those of the Society, the Anti-Defamation League has accused the Society of St. Pius X of being \\"mired in anti-Semitism\\", and journalist John L. Allen, Jr., has said it would be misleading to consider Williamson an isolated case: Father Florian Abrahamowicz, who after being the superior in Italy has since been expelled from the Society also said he was not sure the Nazis had used gas chambers for anything other than disinfection, seemed to cast doubt on the number of six million Jews killed, complained that the Jews had exalted the Holocaust above other genocides, and called the Jews first \\"the people of God\\" and then the \\"people of deicide\\", to be converted to Jesus Christ at the end times.The Lefebvrite case Williamson was forced out of the SSPX on 23 October 2012 for the \\"common good of the society\\", following his refusal to submit to the group's leadership. =Paul Touvier= On 24 May 1989, Paul Touvier, a former secret police official for Petain's Government, was arrested in a Society priory in Nice. The SSPX stated at the time that Touvier had no link to the Society and had been allowed to stay at the Priory as \\"an act of charity to a homeless man\\".AngelusOnline Page 831 In 1994, Touvier was sentenced to life imprisonment for the 1944 summary execution of seven Jews at Rillieux-la-Pape. The massacre was a reprisal for the French Resistance's killing of Petain's Propaganda minister Philippe Henriot. On his death in 1996, a Requiem Mass for the repose of Touvier's soul was offered by Father Philippe Laguérie, an SSPX priest who was then the Rector of the Parisian church of St Nicolas du Chardonnet. Like Fr. Aulagnier, however, Fr. Laguerie subsequently left the Society and founded the Institute of the Good Shepherd with Papal approval. =Southern Poverty Law Center report= The SSPX was also accused of anti-Semitism in a 2006 report on Traditionalist Catholicism published by the legal advocacy organization Southern Poverty Law Center. Defenders of the SSPX have strongly criticised the report and accused the SPLC of using accusations of anti-Semitism as a means of \\"silencing opponents of liberalism.\\" =Newsletters and websites= The society was reported to have perpetuated the Jewish deicide and Jewish world domination plot canards in its official newsletters and on several of its websites internationally (although the offending websites have been removed since the controversy surrounding the bishops' reinstatement).Liphshiz, Cnaan. \\"Report: Vatican readmits society that propagates anti-Semitism.\\" Haaretz. 29 May 2009. \\"The [web]site from Germany ... clarifies that 'contemporary Jews are for sure guilty of the murder of God, as long as they don't recognize Christ as God.'\\" The website of the SSPX in the United States carried a 1997 The Angelus article titled \\"The Mystery of the Jewish People in History\\" which the Overland Express of Melbourne said \\"methodically repeats every slur of medieval anti-Semitism.\\" The piece was written by British priests Michael Crowdy and Kenneth Novak. Statements by SSPX clerics about the Church authorities One of the Society's four bishops, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, has stated that Pope Benedict XVI \\"has professed heresies in the past! He ... has never retracted his errors. When he was a theologian, he professed heresies, he published a book full of heresies.\\"Stephen L. M. Heiner's Interview with Bishop Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, of the Society of St. Pius X, for the print version of the Remnant, Sunday, April 30, 2006 In the same interview, Bishop Mallerais said of the Second Vatican Council: \\"You cannot read Vatican II as a Catholic work. It is based on the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. ...I will say, one day the Church should erase this Council. She will not speak of it anymore. She must forget it. The Church will be wise if she forgets this Council.\\" Similarly, Bishop Richard Williamson has said of Pope Benedict XVI: \\"His past writings are full of Modernist errors. Now, Modernism is the synthesis of all heresies (Pascendi, Pope St. Pius X). So Ratzinger as a heretic goes far beyond Luther's Protestant errors, as Bishop Tissier de Mallerais said.\\" Williamson added that the documents of the Second Vatican Council \\"are much too subtly and deeply poisoned to be reinterpreted. The whole of a partly poisoned cake goes to the trash can!\\"«Ses écrits passés sont pleins d'erreurs modernistes. Or, le modernisme est la synthèse de toutes les hérésies (Pascendi, saint Pie X). Donc, comme hérétique, Ratzinger dépasse de loin les erreurs protestantes de Luther comme l'a très bien dit Mgr Tissier de Mallerais.» Mgr Williamson estime encore que les actes du concile Vatican II «sont beaucoup trop subtilement et profondément empoisonnés pour qu'il faille les réinterpréter. Un gâteau en partie empoisonné va tout entier à la poubelle!». SSPX and Scouting A number of groups whose following overlaps with that of the SSPX, such as the Scouts d'Europe, have been accused of extremist leanings.Les Petits Soldats du Scoutisme, Le Monde, 2 septembre 1998, par Roland-Pierre Paringaux. In 1998, the Association Française de Scouts et Guides Catholiques faced international scrutiny following an accident at Perros-Guirec that claimed the lives of four marine Scouts and of a sailor who died in an attempt to save them. A media frenzy followed, and it was alleged that Fr. Cottard, the SSPX priest responsible for the children, had subjected them to a harsh disciplinary regimen, forcing them to spend the night before their deaths sleeping on a pebbled beach. Fr. Cottard had also failed to call the emergency services for almost 8 hours, and did not take basic safety precautions such as properly checking the weather forecast. Erich Priebke When former S.S. Captain Erich Priebke died in October 2013, the Diocese of Rome forbade a Requiem Mass for him. The reasons cited were Priebke's involvement in murdering 335 Italians in the 1944 Ardeatine Massacre and his subsequent lack of remorse. SSPX offered to hold a funeral and issued a statement on their website saying, \\"A Christian who was baptized and received the sacraments of confession and the Eucharist, no matter what his faults and sins were, to the extent that he dies reconciled with God and the church, has a right to the celebration of the holy Mass and a funeral.\\" Nevertheless, the ceremony was not held due to 500 protesters outside the SSPX headquarters in Albano. The lawyer, Paolo Giachini, told reporters outside the SSPX headquarters that the funeral Mass had not taken place, but that he had fulfilled his obligation to arrange a funeral. \\"Now it's up to the authorities to decide what to do with the body,\\" since he was unable to find a city where Priebke could be buried. Allegations of abuse cover-up On 5 April 2017 Uppdrag Granskning, a Swedish television program focused on investigative journalism, reported that four different clerics of the SSPX – three priests and a former seminarian – had molested at least a dozen young people in several different countries. The program also stated that evidence of abuse was kept secret by the SSPX and that the priests were allowed to continue in ministry. In May 2020, the U.S. state of Kansas started an investigation against SSPX groups affiliated with, though not overseen by, the state's four Roman Catholic Dioceses.https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/kansas- investigating-sexual-abuse-claims-in-breakaway-society-of-st-pius-x-83918 SSPX members in Kansas were accused of either perpetrating or covering up clerical sex abuse in the state. For many years, the SSPX St. Mary's Rectory in Kansas faced numerous sex abuse allegations.https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article242572821.html Other controversies In February 2008 Saint Mary's Academy, a school in Kansas affiliated with the SSPX, refused to allow a woman referee to officiate at a high-school basketball game in which St. Mary's was participating, reportedly on the grounds that it was not appropriate for a woman to be in a position of authority over male students. In response, the other referees refused to referee the game. The school issued a statement denying that the refusal was due to the reported reason. It stated instead that \\"[the] formation of adolescent boys is best accomplished by male role models,\\" and that \\"teaching our boys to treat ladies with deference, we cannot place them in an aggressive athletic competition where they are forced to play inhibited by their concern about running into a female referee.\\" In May 2012, Our Lady of Sorrows Academy in Phoenix, Arizona, also affiliated with the SSPX, forfeited the Arizona Charter Athletic Association state baseball championship game rather than play against a team with a female player. The opposing team, from Mesa Preparatory Academy of Mesa, Arizona, included Paige Sultzbach, playing infield. Officials at Our Lady of Sorrows issued a statement saying that the decision to forfeit was consistent with a policy prohibiting co-ed sports. They stated that school teaches boys respect by not placing girls in athletic competition, where \\"proper boundaries can only be respected with difficulty.\\" References Category:Society of Saint Pius X ","title":"Controversies surrounding the Society of Saint Pius X"},{"id":"22760731","text":"Diane Atkinson is a British historian and author who lives in Shoreditch, London.\\"Di, the Dauntless\\", Diane Atkinson website.

Background In 2000, leaders of 189 countries assembled in New York City to outline a series of targets to address the most serious challenges in the developing world. The MDGs are an eight-point road map with measurable targets and clear deadlines for improving the lives of the world's poorest people. World leaders have agreed to achieve the MDGs by 2015. Organizer The Stand Up is organized by the United Nations Millennium Campaign. The United Nations Millennium Campaign is a UNDP campaign unit in response to the Millennium Declaration signed by 189 member states. Established in October, 2002, it aims to increase support to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and seek a coalition of partners for action. The Millennium Campaign targets intergovernmental, government, civil society organizations and media at both global and regional levels. Participation The forms of participation vary. Common ways to make noise for MDG include: * Public gatherings banging spoons on metal plates to illustrate hunger * Church groups and temples arranging the bells to be rung at the same time in cities across the country * Local musicians playing their instruments in innovative locations. United Nations Millennium Campaign encourages the participants to record the events and inform the Campaign about the details to measure the level of support and increase the political impact.

This state of affairs ended when the Society led a large pilgrimage to Rome for the Jubilee in the year 2000. Under Pope John Paul II Pope John Paul II established the pontifical commission Ecclesia Dei on 2 July 1988 for the care of those former followers of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre who broke with him as a result of his consecration of four priests of his Society of St. Pius X as bishops on 30 June 1988, an act that the Holy See deemed illicit and a schismatic act.Apostolic Letter Ecclesia Dei, 3 Quote: \\"Such disobedience - which implies in practice the rejection of the Roman primacy - constitutes a schismatic act. ... The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and contradictory notion of Tradition\\" (emphases added) The commission initially worked with Father Josef Bisig to establish the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter and then went dormant until 2000. =Role of Cardinal Castrillón Hoyos= A sympathetic Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, president of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, approached the SSPX bishops during the pilgrimage and, according to Bishop Fellay, told them that the pope was prepared to grant them either a personal prelature (a new juridical structure introduced by Vatican II; presently Opus Dei is the only personal prelature) or an apostolic administration (the status given to the traditionalist priests of Campos, Brazil).So I told all these things to the Cardinal.... He spoke about an arrangement like that of Opus Dei, that is, a personal prelature (talk given by Bishop Bernard Fellay in Kansas City, Missouri on 5 March 2002 ). On an earlier occasion Bishop Fellay said that what was under consideration was not a personal prelature but an apostolic administration (Communicantes: August 2001 ). The SSPX leadership responded with distrust,The Superior General expressed his point of view, his distrust, his apprehension (Statement of Bishop Fellay to SSPX Members & Friends January 22, 2001 ) saying that Castrillón was vague on how the new structure would be implemented and sustained, and criticising the Holy See's allegedly heavy-handed treatment of the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter.\\"Rome’s failure to understand our position is such that if today we accepted their agreement, tomorrow we would have to undergo exactly the same treatment as Saint Peter’s Fraternity, which is muzzled, and being led where it does not want to go\\". See also. They requested two preliminary \\"signs\\" before continuing negotiations: that the Holy See grant permission for all priests to celebrate the Tridentine Mass; and that its statement that the 1988 consecrations had resulted in excommunication for the clerics involved be declared void.On January 16, there was another meeting with Cardinal Castrillon, during which the Superior General exposed the necessity of having guaranties from Rome before going ahead in the details of eventual discussions or an agreement: That the Tridentine Mass be granted to all priests of the entire world; That the censures against the Bishops be declared null (Statement of Bishop Fellay to SSPX Members & Friends January 22 2001 ); We thus did require these two signs, first the withdrawal of the decree of excommunication and, secondly, the permission for all the priests of the Latin rite, without distinction, to celebrate the traditional Mass. I believe these two steps would have been able to create a truly new climate in the universal Church ( Interview with Bishop Fellay, August 2001, Angelus magazine) =2002 letter= Cardinal Castrillón refused to grant interviews on the subject, in order \\"to maintain the privacy of the details of our dialogue\\", though this silence was broken when his letter of 5 April 2002 to Bishop Bernard Fellay was later published.Letter to Fellay This contained the text of a protocol summarizing the meeting between the two men held on 29 December 2000. This envisaged a reconciliation on the basis of the Lefebvre-Ratzinger protocol of 5 May 1988; the 1988 excommunications would be lifted rather than declared null. From 2003 onwards, the annual reports of the Ecclesia Dei Commission began to report on dialogue between the Vatican authorities and the SSPX, beginning with \\"some high-level meetings and... an exchange of correspondence\\" in 2003,2003 edition of L'Attività della Santa Sede (), page 1097 continuing with \\"dialogue at various levels... [and] meetings, some at a high level\\" in 2004,2004 edition of L'Attività della Santa Sede (), page 1090 and leading to \\"somewhat improved\\" dialogue with \\"more concrete proposals\\" in 2005.2005 edition of L'Attività della Santa Sede (), page 1168. Under Pope Benedict XVI The year 2005 was of great significance because it saw the accession to the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI, who had participated in the 1988 negotiations and who was seen as being sympathetic to the use of the Tridentine liturgy. In August 2005, Benedict met with Bishop Fellay for 35 minutes, at the latter's request.Benedict and the Lefebvrites, John L. Allen, Jr., Word From Rome, National Catholic Reporter, September 2, 2005. There was no breakthrough, but statements from both sides spoke of the atmosphere as positive. It was reported that the SSPX question was among the topics for discussion at meetings of the Pope with cardinals and Curia officials in early 2006.Pope, Curia to discuss reconciliation with SSPX, National Catholic Reporter, 24 March 2006 =Summorum Pontificum= In July 2007, the Pope issued Summorum Pontificum, which liberalised the restrictions on the celebration of the Tridentine Mass. In an accompanying letter, he wrote that he wished to see \\"an interior reconciliation in the heart of the Church\\" and \\"to make every effort to enable for all those who truly desire unity to remain in that unity or to attain it anew\\" - presumably a reference to the SSPX and other traditionalists in dispute with Rome. Bishop Fellay, while welcoming the Pope's decision, referred to \\"the difficulties that still remain\\", and stated that the SSPX wished that the new \\"favourable climate\\" would \\"make it possible - after the decree of excommunication which still affects its bishops has been withdrawn – to consider more serenely the disputed doctrinal issues.\\" In April 2008, Bishop Fellay issued Letter to Friends and Benefactors No. 72, informing the SSPX faithful that, in spite of both Summorum Pontificum and the recent Vatican documents on the true meaning of Lumen gentium and evangelisation, the Society still could not sign an agreement with the Holy See, which was not going to deal with doctrinal errors. Two months later, after a meeting held in Rome between the two, Cardinal Castrillòn Hoyos indicated five conditions that SSPX must comply with as a preparatory step for achieving full communion.Conditions qui résultent de l'entretien du 4 juin 2008 entre le Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos et l'Evêque Bernard Fellay. See also http://www.la-croix.com/illustrations/Multimedia/Actu/2008/6/25/vatican.rtf La Croix, 25 June 2008. The Cardinal did not ask in an explicit way for acceptance of the Second Vatican Council as a true Ecumenical Council or of the validity of the Mass of Paul VI, matters on which the Secretariat of State later made clear agreement is required for unity of doctrine.Note of the Secretariat of State, 4 February 2009 On several occasions, but especially in the homily Fellay preached at Lourdes for the SSPX Pilgrimage, on 26 October 2008,http://dici.org/dl/fichiers/The_New_Rosary_Crusade.pdf he replied that the Vatican requests were ambiguous. He also launched a new Rosary Crusade for 1 November to Christmas 2008. The first such Crusade was undertaken to ask for liberalization of Tridentine Mass. The second was to pray that the 1988 excommunications be declared void. Fellay later reported on DICI.org that one million seven hundred thousand rosaries were prayed in this Crusade. =Remission of the excommunication= By a decree of 21 January 2009 (Protocol Number 126/2009), which was issued in response to a renewed request dated 15 December 2008 that Bishop Fellay made on behalf of all four bishops whom Lefebvre had consecrated on 30 June 1988, the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, by the power expressly granted to him by Pope Benedict XVI, remitted the automatic excommunication that they had thereby incurred, and expressed the wish that this would be followed speedily by full communion of the whole of the Society of Saint Pius X with the Church, thus bearing witness, by the proof of visible unity, to true loyalty and true recognition of the Pope's Magisterium and authority.Decree remitting the excommunication \\"latae sententiae\\" of the Bishops of the Society of St Pius X (January 21, 2009) A Note of the Secretariat of State issued on 4 February 2009 specified that, while the lifting of the excommunication freed the four bishops from a very grave canonical penalty, it made no change in the juridical situation of the Society of St. Pius X, which continued to lack canonical recognition in the Catholic Church, and that the four bishops remained without any canonical function in the Church and were not exercising legitimately any ministry within it. The note added that future recognition of the Society required full recognition of the Second Vatican Council and of the teaching of Popes John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, and repeated the assurance given in the decree of 21 January 2009 that the Holy See would study, along with those involved, the questions not yet settled, so as to reach a full satisfactory solution of the problems that had given rise to the split.Bulletin of the Press Office of the Holy See, 4 February 2009 Pope Benedict XVI confirmed this stance in his motu proprio Ecclesiae unitatem of 2 July 2009, in which he declared that by lifting the excommunication of the four bishops he \\"intended to remove an impediment that might have jeopardized the opening of a door to dialogue and thereby to invite the Bishops and the 'Society of St Pius X' to rediscover the path to full communion with the Church. ... the remission of the excommunication was a measure taken in the context of ecclesiastical discipline to free the individuals from the burden of conscience constituted by the most serious of ecclesiastical penalties. However, the doctrinal questions obviously remain and until they are clarified the Society has no canonical status in the Church and its ministers cannot legitimately exercise any ministry.\\" =Fellay-Levada talks, 2009-2011= In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI gave the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, then headed by Cardinal William Levada the task of continuing the dialogue with the Society of St Pius X on theological issues in the hope of attaining reconciliation.Catholic World Report, \\"Vatican newspaper addresses traditionalist concerns\\" The team responsible for the dialogue with the Society of St. Pius X on behalf of the Catholic Church included Charles Morerod, former Rector Magnificus and theology and philosophy professor of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. In February 2011, Bishop Bernard Fellay, said that reconciliation talks with the Vatican would soon be coming to an end, with little change in the views of either side. In addition to disputes over the changes introduced by the Second Vatican Council, new problems had been created by plans to beatify Pope John Paul II on 1 May 2011, which, he said, posed \\"a serious problem, the problem of a pontificate that caused things to proceed by leaps and bounds in the wrong direction, along 'progressive' lines, toward everything that they call 'the spirit of Vatican II.'\\" On 14 September 2011, Cardinal Levada met Bishop Fellay and presented to him a document referred to as a doctrinal preamble to possible rehabilitation of the Society and the granting to it of a canonical status within the Church. It was planned to publish the preamble or a revised version of it only after agreement with the SSPX, but the document was believed to consist essentially in the profession of faith required of persons taking up offices in the Church.Text of the Profession of Faith Giovanni Cavalcoli, O.P., \\"Status of SSPX as of January 2012\\" DICI (official website of SSPX), \\"Interview with Bishop Bernard Fellay : The Society of St. Pius X and the Doctrinal Preamble\\" =Agreement rejected= The Society responded on 21 December 2011 with what the Congregation considered documentation rather than a reply, and in the following month delivered a substantive reply.La Stampa, \\"Fellay's second response\\" Catholic World News, \\"SSPX offers 2nd response to Vatican on 'Doctrinal Preamble'\\" A further meeting between Levada and Fellay took place on 16 March 2012, at which Levada handed Fellay a letter evaluating the Society's response. The Holy See published a note that declared: \\"In compliance with the decision by Pope Benedict XVI, the evaluation of the response of His Excellency Bishop Fellay was communicated to him by a letter delivered to him today. This evaluation notes that the position that he expressed is not sufficient to overcome the doctrinal problems that are at the basis of the rift between the Holy See and the aforesaid Society. At the conclusion of today's meeting, out of a concern for avoiding an ecclesial rupture with painful and incalculable consequences, the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X was invited to be so kind as to clarify his position so as to heal the existing rift, as Pope Benedict XVI wished.\\" The Society, which was reported to be deeply divided on the issue of acceptance or rejection, was given until 15 April 2012 to clarify its position.La Stampa, \\"The Holy See gives the Lefebvrians one more month to decide\\" On 17 April 2012 the response reached the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which studied it and submitted it to the judgement of Pope Benedict XVI.Comunicato della Pontificia Commissione \\"Ecclesia Dei\\" 18.04.2012 Another meeting between Levada and Fellay took place on 13 June 2012, at which the cardinal presented the Holy See's evaluation of the April response of the Society and proposed a personal prelature as the most appropriate instrument for any future canonical recognition of the Society.Vatican Information Service, \\"Bishop Fellay visits the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith\\" Bishop Fellay indicated that he could not sign the document of the Holy See's evaluation.Christian Century, \\"Breakaway Catholic group spurns Vatican's overture\\"National Catholic Reporter, \\"Traditionalist SSPX calls Vatican offer 'clearly unacceptable'\\" In reply to an enquiry by Fellay whether the evaluation had been truly approved by the Pope, Benedict XVI sent him a hand- written letter assuring him that it was indeed his personal decision.Vatican Insider, \\"Rome needs to change its demands if it wants to reach an agreement with SSPX\\" In July 2012, the Society held a general chapter to consider the June communication from the Holy See and issued a declaration that \\"the Society continues to uphold the declarations and the teachings of the constant Magisterium of the Church in regard to all the novelties of the Second Vatican Council which remain tainted with errors, and also in regard to the reforms issued from it\\".Society of St. Pius X General Chapter Statement The Holy See declared that it awaited an official response from the Society.Comunicato della Sala Stampa sulla Dichiarazione del Capitolo Generale della Fraternità San Pio X, 19.07.2012 In an interview on 4 October 2012, Archbishop Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the new President of the Pontifical Commission \\"Ecclesia Dei\\", remarked, with regard to the Holy See's demand that the Society accept the decisions of the Second Vatican Council, including those on religious freedom and human rights: \\"In a pastoral sense, the door is always open\\"; he added: \\"We cannot put the Catholic faith at the mercy of negotiations. Compromise does not exist in this field. I think that there can now be no new discussions.\\"NDR, \\"Glaubenspräfekt Müller: Keine Gespräche mehr mit Piusbruderschaft\\" Again on 27 October 2012, the Pontifical Commission stated that the Society had indicated on 6 September 2012 that it needed more time to prepare its response to the Holy See's initiatives. The Commission commented: \\"After thirty years of separation, it is understandable that time is needed to absorb the significance of these recent developments. As Our Holy Father Pope Benedict XVI seeks to foster and preserve the unity of the Church by realizing the long hoped-for reconciliation of the Priestly Fraternity of St. Pius X with the See of Peter – a dramatic manifestation of the munus Petrinum in action – patience, serenity, perseverance and trust are needed.\\" A December 2012 letter, in English and in French, from Archbishop Joseph Augustine Di Noia, Vice-President of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, to all the members of the society indicated that the official reply of Bishop Fellay had not yet been received. Archbishop Di Noia lamented that some of the society's superiors \\"employ language, in unofficial communications, that to all the world appears to reject the very provisions, assumed to be still under study, that are required for the reconciliation and for the canonical regularization of the Fraternity within the Catholic Church\\". He added: \\"The only imaginable future for the Priestly Fraternity lies along the path of full communion with the Holy See, with the acceptance of an unqualified profession of the faith in its fullness, and thus with a properly ordered ecclesial, sacramental and pastoral life.\\"Il Sigmografo, 19 January 2013 In a declaration of 27 June 2013, the remaining three bishops of the society (after the expulsion of Richard Williamson in 2012) said that \\"the cause of the grave errors which are in the process of demolishing the Church does not reside in a bad interpretation of the conciliar texts – a 'hermeneutic of rupture' which would be opposed to a 'hermeneutic of reform in continuity' – but truly in the texts themselves\\", and declared that the Mass as celebrated by the Pope and the generality of the Catholic Church's bishops and priests is \\"penetrated with an ecumenical and Protestant spirit, democratic and humanist, which empties out the sacrifice of the Cross\\".Declaration on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the episcopal consecrations (30th June 1988 – 27th June 2013) The Catholic News Agency saw this declaration as a repudiation of Pope Benedict XVI's teaching that the Second Vatican Council should be interpreted in a \\"hermeneutic of continuity\\" with previous Church teaching and as indicating a definitive break with the Catholic Church.Traditionalists indicate definitive break with Catholic Church Under Pope Francis On 12 October 2013, Fellay declared, \\"We thank God, we have been preserved from any kind of agreement from last year\\", and said that the society had withdrawn the text that it presented to Rome on 15 April 2012, at the same time declaring that Pope Francis was \\"a genuine Modernist\\". He expressed a different view about Pope Francis on 11 May 2014, saying that he had read twice a biography of Archbishop Lefebvre and enjoyed it: \\"With the current pope, as he is a practical man, he looks at people. What a person thinks, what he believes, is at the end a matter of indifference to him. What matters is that this person be sympathetic in his view, that he seems correct to him, one may say it like this./ And therefore he read twice Bp. Tissier de Mallerais' book on Abp. Lefebvre, and this book pleased him; he is against all that we represent, but, as a life, it pleased him.\\" He also described how Pope Francis took a tolerant view of the FSSPX in Argentina, even saying that \\"I will not condemn them, and I will not stop anyone from visiting them.\\"SSPX Bp. Fellay on Pope Francis: \\"He has read the biography of Abp. Lefebvre twice and he liked it.\\" And Some Other Important Revelations, Rorate Caeli, May 2015 The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera published on 22 December 2013 an interview with Archbishop Müller in which he was asked: \\"Now that the discussions have failed, what is the situation of the Lefebvrians?\\" Müller replied: \\"The canonical excommunication for the illicit ordinations has been lifted from the bishops, but the sacramental de facto excommunication for schism remains; they have departed from communion with the Church. We do not follow that up by shutting the door, we never do, and we call on them to be reconciled. But on their part too, they must change their attitude and accept the Catholic Church's conditions and the Supreme Pontiff as the definitive criterion of membership.\\"Corriere della Sera, 22 December 2013, p. 5Catholic World News: \\"CDF prefect says SSPX in schism, suspended from sacraments\\" =Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy= In 2016, in commemoration of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, Pope Francis granted permission for priests of the Society of Saint Pius X to validly confer absolution, while they previously did not possess the jurisdiction needed to confer this sacrament. At the end of the Jubilee of Mercy, Pope Francis allowed this permission to continue indefinitely. =Filial correction= In August 2017, Bishop Fellay joined 61 other Catholic theologians and critics of Pope Francis in signing the Correctio filialis de haeresibus propagatis, a filial correction regarding seven alleged heresies contained in Pope Francis's apostolic exhortation Amoris Laetitia. The Holy See did not respond to the filial correction. However, Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, indirectly addressed the controversy, advocating for those who disagree with the Pope to dialog with the church and “find ways to understand one another.”https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/09/28/popes-deputy-urges-dialogue- francis-accused-heresy/ =Suppression of Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei= Pope Francis suppressed the Commission and merged its responsibilities into the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on 17 January 2019, and the Holy See Press Office published his decree on 19 January. He said that the outstanding issues were \\"of a doctrinal nature\\" and that a group within the CDF would take on the Commission's responsibilities. A Vatican source said Francis' action represented \\"a normalization of the ecclesiastical status of traditionalist communities in the Pius X ambit which many years ago were reconciled with the See of Peter, as well as those celebrating the extraordinary form\\". He characterized the suppression as a \\"mundane\\" reorganization that recognized how much the Commission had achieved in establishing traditional communities within the Church.

It was the first building in Geneva designed to house an international organization. In 1975 the ILO moved to Grand Saconnex and in 1977 the Centre William Rappard was occupied by the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and the library of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. By 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO) replaced the GATT and became the main occupant of the Centre William Rappard. In 2008-2013, the building was completely renovated and an extension was constructed to make available more office space and meeting rooms. History The original site of the Centre William Rappard was part of an estate formed from the Rappard and Bloch properties, and contained two mansions. The original Villa Rappard was built in 1785, and renovated in 1894. The Villa Bloch was demolished in 1957 to make way for the south wing expansion of the Centre William Rappard. The Villa Rappard and land, situated to the north of the original site, were acquired by the ILO in 1963. The Swiss Confederation bought the estate in 1921 and donated it to the League of Nations in 1923. Later that year, the Swiss architect George Épitaux (1873–1957) was commissioned to build the new ILO headquarters. The construction lasted three years, and the new building was inaugurated on 6 June 1926. Wings were added to the north-east (1937), south-west (1938), south (1951), and south-east (1957). In 1975 the ILO moved to neighbouring Grand Saconnex and the property was owned by the Building Foundation for International Organizations (FIPOI), of the Swiss Confederation and the Canton of Geneva. In 1977, the building was named Centre William Rappard after the Swiss diplomat William Rappard (1883–1958), and was occupied by the secretariat of the GATT, the UNHCR, and the Graduate Institute's library. Salle des Pas-Perdus In 1995, the Centre became the headquarters of the World Trade Organization (WTO), that is the current owner of the building. In 1998 a conference centre was built next to Rue de Lausanne, by the Swiss architect Ugo Brunoni. In 2007, following research conducted at the ILO archives and WTO locations, various hidden artworks were rediscovered and exposed to visitors.World Trade Organization. Centre William Rappard: Home of the World Trade Organization (Geneva: WTO Publications, 2011), p. 31 After the creation of the WTO, the organization lacked space for staff and delegates for their daily meetings. After considering several options, the Swiss authorities and the WTO have reached an agreement in early August 2008 to renovate, extend and improve the Centre William Rappard. This was the best solution in terms of cost and efficiency. In 2008 the renovation and extension of the building was approved by the Swiss Confederation. Works started in 2009, and added an extension providing 300 new work places (out of total 1,200 potential places in the whole building) and an underground car park with 200 places).Building Foundation for International Organizations. Website (http://www.fipoi.ch), accessed 26 May 2009 Furthermore, the original building was fully renovated to add more working space for staff members, delegates and visitors. Works were performed in three phases: 2008-2011, renovation of the General Council Room, modernization of infrastructure (electricity, plumbing, heating), and creation of new rooms. 2010-2012, densifying and increasing the indoor capacity, including the Atrium in the former north courtyard and large meeting rooms in the south courtyard. 2011-2013: construction of the new building between the former south parking and the park. Description Main entrance The original building by Lausanne-born George Épitaux was based on a classical Florentine villa, with an interior courtyard, grand entrance and a sweeping staircase leading up from the main entrance hall. The size of the first construction was 86.30 x 33.80 metres, with the top of the central cupola at 32 metres from the floor level. Entirely built in cement, some areas also include granite from Ticino and sandstone from Würenlos (Aargau). Épitaux hired renowned sculptors and artisans, including Luc Jaggi (1887–1976), Maurice Sarki (Sarkissoff) (1882–1946), León Perrin (1886–1978), and others. Immediately after the World War II George Épitaux was commissioned again to build two extensions to the north and south of the original building.Graf, Robert Henri. Le Bureau International du Travail: les oeuvres d'art et les dons reçus par cette institution (Geneva: unpublished, 1951) Geometric shapes and symbolic decorations were used in the extensions to provide esthetic consistency. The renovation and construction performed in 2008-2013 included two major projects, changes in the original structure and a new building. Among the changes and improvements included in the renovation are the transformation of the former north courtyard of the original building in an Atrium. This was developed by Group8 Architects of Geneva, who focused on modernization, space optimization, respect for the past, and transformation with respect for the environment. The new building in the south of the Centre William Rappard, by Jen Wittfoht of Stuttgart, Germany, achieves discretion, dialogue between modern and classic, efficiency, low energy standards and integration to the space (street, park and lake). The WTO is located in a natural setting and its building extension is part of a sustainable development approach. The first priority has been given to preserve biodiversity and natural areas. This is why the WTO has followed the Minergie P standard and has chosen non-polluting and recyclable materials for the new building as well as the renovation of CWR. Materials have been selected on the basis of a life cycle assessment, considering all the energy required for their production, manufacture, use and recycling. The extension is one element of the border lake landscape. Its glass structure reflects the natural surroundings in a way that the building integrates to the landscape. One of the objectives of the WTO has been to construct a building requiring very low energy consumption. Energy savings are fully effective owing to the installation of solar panels that reap enough energy to heat the water used by the WTO. A protective film installed on the windows also helps to create better insulation, repeals ultraviolet radiations and reduces energy costs. Lake Geneva has become the natural air conditioning of the building (\\"Genève-Lac-Nations\\" network). Heating and cooling systems are supplied by the deep waters of the lake, which are transported and distributed according to a hydrothermal network. Heat pumps are also used. This system has been developed by \\"Services Industriels de Genève\\". All other energy sources available on the site (sun, wind, vegetation, soil characteristics) are used as well. The exceptional brightness of the lake borders is also an asset and the building has been designed so that the daylight illuminates the offices as long as possible. La Dignité du Travail, by Maurice Denis, 1931 The Centre William Rappard houses a collection of artworks, most of them donated during ILO times by governments and institutions. Some of these artworks are Maurice Denis’s “The Dignity of Labour” (1931), Seán Keating’s \\"Irish Industrial Development\\" (1961), Jorge Colaço’s \\"Grape-harvesting\\", \\"Ploughing the soil\\" and \\"Fishing\\" tiled panels (1928), Luc Jaggi’s “Peace” and “Justice” statues (1925), Albert Hahn Jr.’s Delft panel (1926), Gustave-Louis Jaulmes’s \\"Universal Joy\\", \\"Work in Abundance\\" and \\"The Benefits of Leisure\\" murals (1940), Dean Cornwell’s murals on labour (1955), Eduardo Chicharro y Agüera’s “Pygmalion” (1925), and Gilbert Bayes’s “Child with Fish” (or “Blue Robed Bambino”) fountain (1926). Among the recent donations and acquisitions are Jean-Claude Prêtre's \\"Danaé World Suite / 11 September 2001\\", and Catherine Bolle's \\"Outre Terre\\". Under the trees in the street-side of the Centre William Rappard, a Chinese Garden has been donated in 2013 by the Ministry of Commerce of China and the Municipal Government of Suzhou to celebrate the tenth anniversary of China's accession to the WTO. Criticism Following the approval by the Swiss federal authorities, on 6 April 2009 the city of Geneva approved the expansion of the Centre William Rappard. The work included major changes in the internal courtyards, and a new wing on what was the south parking. Following Swiss standards for the protection of international organizations and foreign officers, security installations were built, including a perimeter around the building. Budget was 150 million Swiss Francs, including 70 million by the Swiss Confederation and 60 million as a loan by FIPOI. The City Council approved the expansion with 50 votes in favour and 17 against it, the latter including \\"A gauche toute!\\" and UDC parties. Christian Zaugg and Pierre Vanek of \\"A gauche toute!\\" advanced that a referendum would be held to oppose the construction.La Tribune de Genève, 7 April 2009 Against the advice of the majority of Geneva political leaders, including the responsible for municipal and cantonal constructions Mark Muller of the Liberal Party, and Sandrine Salerno of the Socialist Party, the organisers of the referendum obtained 6,919 signatures supporting their project (versus a minimum of 4,000). However, after verification only 4,022 signatures were validated.Le Temps, 27 May 2009 The referendum took place on 27 September 2009, with 61.8 per cent of voters supporting the expansion of the Centre William Rappard (turnout 39.5 per cent) \\"By accepting this project, Genevans showed their commitment to the international city and to multiculturalism\\" declared Sandrine Salerno.La Tribune de Genève (online), 27 September 2009 Director-General Pascal Lamy said that the results of the referendum \\"will encourage us to extend our outreach to you even further”.WTO press release 28 September 2009 Photo gallery Image:Cwr villabloch.jpgVilla Bloch (formerly Rochefoucault) Image:cwr villabloch park.jpgVilla Bloch park and Lake Léman, ca. 1923 Image:cwr aerial 1926.jpgAerial view, 1926 Image:cwr aerial 1937.jpgAerial view, 1938 Image:Cwr lake facade2.jpgLake façade and park of former ILO Image:cwr details main hall.jpgEntrance hall floor Image:cwr gilbert bayes.jpgCourtyard, ornamental fountain Image:cwr west facade perrin.jpgFaçade decorations File:cwr dean cornwell mural.jpgMurals by Dean Cornwell, 1955 See also * World Trade Organization * General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade * International Labour Organization * United Nations Office at Geneva References Further reading  * BIT, Programme du Concours pour l'Étude d'un Projet en vue de la Construction d'un Édifice destiné au Bureau International du Travail à Genève (undated).

Started in 1997, the project spread over 10 volumes. About The Research Project The HCLI project includes such issues as: the appearance of culture and literature in Iran; the formation of oral literature and its components, followed by the appearance of children’s literature in ancient times; after Islam, in the early part of the 20th century, and its development up to the Islamic Revolution in 1978. HCLI will analyze the concept of childhood, educational ideas and the literature of each period under consideration. Also the broader socio-economic and cultural situations will be reviewed in light of historical developments. Sample text illustrations from the different periods will complete the discussions and provide a unique anthology. Some of the questions to be answered by the HCLI are as follows: When did Iranian society start considering children as different from adults; how have thinkers defined the child and its special needs; when did children’s literature begin; and in which historical period were the first books produced. These and many other questions will be raised and discussed in light of existing historical documents. Research in pre- Islamic and Islamic works, makes it clear that there are very few texts addressed directly to children. However, many passages can be found in the general literary works that are written for children and are clearly addressed to the young reader. This has been discussed extensively in volumes1 and 2 of the HCLI. The turning point occurs in the late 19th century and early 20th century, when such new factors enter the scene: new educational concepts, continuity of oral literature and folklore, development of a more simple Persian prose, the advent of translations from the West, the start of the printing industry in Iran, establishment of new schools, the study of child psychology, and the rise of pioneer personalities as early publishers of books for children. As an extensive research project, the HCLI will also review the children’s literature of Iran’s minorities such as the Azaris, the Kurds, Zoroastrians, Christians and Jews. Research Method The History of Children’s Literature is an extensive research project based on the historical status of children in Iranian society, prevailing educational views and the growth of children’s literature. Children’s Literature in Iran is a thin branch of the immense and aged tree of Iranian arts and culture. Nevertheless, by researching this thin branch, a whole new field has stretched before us. We have chosen a comprehensive method for this research, which reaches back to 3000 years ago. The project begins with the oral tradition, focusing on ancient times, when literature was narrated for children generation by generation. In 1996, when we started this project, we weren't aware of its extent and thought we could finish the history in one or two volumes. It didn't take a long time, however, to realize we were wrong. After studying documents, we reached the conclusion that Iran has one of the richest treasuries of children’s literature in the world. We began by posing many questions, including: what kinds of texts are considered children’s literatures? How far can we go back in accessing the earliest documents? What is the relationship between oral children’s literature and formal texts? And, how could children’s literature be coordinated in relation to historical eras? To answer these questions we have chosen the method of analyzing ideas from the general to the specific. This method helps us see every specific text in relation to the general context. In the first chapters of every volume (period), general, historical and cultural aspects of each period are analyzed. Then, we have surveyed the status of Iranian children and evaluated educational attitudes. For example, it was much easier to understand the emergence of courtesy literature written for princes when we learned about the educational philosophy of that period. After surveying general societal aspects, we have addressed children’s literature specifically. We have tried to determine the genre of every single document in addition its historical status. The most difficult and complicated process in this project was recognizing, finding and accessing books and documents. The old documents and texts related to children’s literature were much dispersed and because this research is the first in this field, there is no comprehensive bibliography of children’s books. We had to look over all bibliographies, biographies, and newspapers and magazines, which were published during a specific era to find and prepare a list of children’s books from that time. In finding every unique document, we have searched many secondhand bookstores in Tehran and other cities in addition to all public and private libraries. We have started this research with the oral tradition, because it is not allocated to a specific time and it links ancient times to the contemporary era. In this research it was rather impossible to include the oral literature of all ethnic groups. We found that the children’s oral literature was a rich treasure preserved by each of the dozens of the Iran’s ethnic groups. Even this small sample expresses the variety and the extent of children’s oral literature. The diversity of Iranian culture is so outstanding that we could survey only a small part of it. Because Iran is an ancient land with diverse and dispersed ethnic groups, we have extended our research beyond children’s written literature in Persian. In our research we include Armenian, Assyrian, Azari, Kurdish and Zoroastrian children’s literature. We have included different margin notes in relation with the main text such as: “interview with history”, “literary and historical surveys”, “selected texts” and tables and charts. These additions help familiarize the reader with historical phenomena by offering different perspectives. For example, in addition to helping the reader comprehend the given analysis, “selected texts” allow them to access rare old documents; “Interview with history” where people who were involved with children’s literature, speak about their experience, allows the reader the opportunity to consider views other than the main writer’s.

For nineteen years he was member of parliament for Forfarshire. He was the son of George Barclay of Cults, near Aberdeen and his wife Margaret née Massie of Maryculter, Kincardineshire. He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and the University of Aberdeen. He entered business as a manure merchant, and was also a major landowner and farmer. He farmed in Forfarshire, which had large amounts of grazing land for cattle. He was involved in the innovation of importing store cattle from the United States and Canada. In 1864 Barclay was elected to the town council of the royal burgh of Aberdeen. He continued to a member until 1871, and was leader of the \\"Progressive\\" grouping, allied to the parliamentary Liberal Party, that controlled the council. In June 1872 Colonel William Sykes, MP for Aberdeen died. Barclay was chosen as the official Liberal candidate. However, his reputation as a Radical led to a split in the local party, and John Farley Leith was also nominated as a \\"Moderate Liberal\\". In the event Leith was successful and Barclay was defeated. In January 1874 a general election was called, and Barclay was nominated as Liberal candidate for the Forfarshire constituency. He was elected, and held the seat for the party at the 1880 and 1885 elections. He was described by the Marquess of Huntly as \\"a thick-set man of medium height, dark-haired and swarthy. He had the misfortune to speak through his nose with a twang, and was not a success in the House of Commons as a speaker\\". In 1886 the Liberal Party split over the issue of Irish Home Rule and Barclay joined the break-away Liberal Unionist Party. At the ensuing general election he was returned as Unionist MP for Forfarshire. He was unseated at the next general election in 1892, when John Rigby regained the seat for the Liberals. Barclay did not run for election again, but devoted himself to agriculture. In 1901 he purchased the Glenbuchat Estate, where he pioneered experiments in new scientific farming methods. He was also an enthusiastic supporter of the Aberdeen Agricultural College. He was twice married. In 1863 he married Jane Smith of Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, who died in 1865. His second marriage was to Lilian Alice Novelli of London. He died in February 1907, aged 74, while on a visit to Nigeria.

The group was led by Carlos Javier (the Charles Xavier of the 1602 universe). Like her Marvel Universe counterpart, Jean has telekinetic powers. Besides Javier and Nicholas Fury, the only one who knows of Jean's deception is Scotius Summerisle (Scott Summers), who is attracted to her. \\"John\\" also has a close friendship with Werner (Angel) who only learns her true gender after she sacrifices her life for her comrades, during their battle against Otto Von Doom (Doctor Doom). Werner tells Scott that he was attracted to Jean, although he had thought that she was male. After her death, her friends gave her a burial at sea. When her corpse is cremated, the fire forms a giant Phoenix raptor before disappearing.Marvel 1602 #7 Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse storyline, Jean is a student of Magneto.X-Men Chronicles 01 (1995); She is forced to suppress her telepathic powers in order to escape from the Shadow King's attacks. She eventually falls in love with fellow student, Weapon X. Jean is later kidnapped by Mr. Sinister, who offers her a place among his team. She refuses, and is sent to Sinister's breeding pens. Weapon X rescues her, but not before Sinister extracted her DNA and combined it with that of Cyclops to engineer the perfect mutant, X-Man. Weapon X, and Jean leave the X-Men and join forces with the Human High Council. She learns of a plan to drop nuclear bombs on the United States to kill Apocalypse. She confronts Weapon X, then leaves him to try to stop the attack with the aid of Cyclops. She's apparently killed at the hands of Cyclops' brother, Prelate Havok, before she can hold back the nuclear bombs with her telekinesis.X-Men: Omega (1995) In the tenth-anniversary limited series, it is revealed that Jean was the one that stopped the nuclear attack from the Human High Council with the last of her powers. She was also \\"resurrected\\" by Sinister and began displaying Phoenix Force powers, known in this reality as \\"Mutant Alpha\\" abilities. Jean doesn't remember her old life at first, so Sinister manipulated her to create a new team to fight the X-Men, the Sinister Six. During the fight between the two teams, Logan is able to connect emotionally with Jean. She turns on Sinister and incinerates him. Jean and Logan reunite, and she becomes leader of the X-Men at Magneto's behest.X-Men: Age of Apocalypse #6 Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows In this continuity, she is married to Wolverine and is a co-director of education for Xavier's School of Gifted Youngsters. The two have a daughter named Kate whom the others nickname \\"Shine.\\" It's revealed that she broke up with Scott after he lost faith in Xavier's vision when Xavier and the Avengers proposed self-policing of mutant and superhero kind with the Avengers to prevent the Superhuman Registration Act. When Xavier offers an invitation for Spider-Man and Mary-Jane's daughter to enroll in their school, she tries to convince the couple that it's the right decision.Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows (vol. 2) #6 Days of Future Past In the timeline known as the Days of Future Past, Jean dies when Mastermind detonated a nuclear device at Pittsburgh, after she had given birth to her and Scott's daughter, Rachel, a few months before. There are conflicting reports whether this Jean had been replaced by the Phoenix Force. Earth X The past of Jean Grey of Earth-9997 mirrors that of her Earth-616 counterpart. In recent history, Jean had once again lost her telepathic abilities— the circumstances behind her loss of this ability are as yet unrevealed. However, this would eventually spare Jean's life when the psychic birth of the Skull resulted in the death of every telepathic being on the planet, killing Jean's mentor Professor Xavier. Shortly after his death, the X-Men disbanded. Either prior to, or shortly after the disbanding of the X-Men, Jean would leave Cyclops after a long relationship to pursue a romance with Scott's rival for Jean's affections, Wolverine. However, Wolverine and Jean's life would devolve into a New York stereotype of the bickering couple. Both would put on significant amounts weight and would resort to arguing with each other. When Wolverine would refuse to help the heroes defend New York from the Skull and his army, Jean would leave Wolverine in disgust, telling him that she was really Madelyne Pryor to rankle Wolverine even more. Jean would resurface years later at the wedding of Medusa and King Britain, which served as a brief reunion of the surviving members of the X-Men. Jean would reconcile with Wolverine, however, the two would remain apart. Her current whereabouts are unknown. Marvel Mangaverse Jean Grey In the original Marvel Mangaverse X-Men and X-Men Ronin stories, Jean is a powerful telepath and telekinetic and calls herself Marvel Girl, but she also has access to the Phoenix Force. The three-issue X-Men: Phoenix – Legacy of Fire limited series, involves a separate character based on Jean Grey named \\"Jena Pyre\\". Jena and her sister Madelyne are the guardians of the \\"Phoenix Sword\\", whose power Jean absorbs. The miniseries depicts the lead characters in near-nudity. The series' rating was raised from PG to PG+ before issue #1 was released, and the series was moved to the MAX mature readers imprint for issues #2 and #3. Marvel Zombies 2 Jean Grey as Dark Phoenix appears in the sequel to Marvel Zombies, now a member of the Zombie Galactus, or rather Galacti, alongside other heroes. The zombie Hulk punches through her body and squishes her head while she attempted to subdue him, thus killing her.Marvel Zombies 2 #5 (2008) Mutant X Jean's history in the Mutant X universe is quite muddled. Under the name of Ariel, she was a founding member of the X-Men and in love with their leader, Havok. Some time later during a mission, Jean was believed dead and later on Havok married her lookalike, Madelyne Pryor, Jean's clone. In reality, Jean was saved by Apocalypse and Magneto, and hidden from Professor X who was capturing all the telepaths in the world for his evil plans. When she re-surfaced, Jean was working together with Sinister and Apocalypse to recruit the aid of Havok's new team, the Six, against an evil Xavier. That crisis having passed, Jean joined the Six, as Madelyne had been turned into the Goblin Queen and was no longer with them. Jean also mentioned having been in a relationship with Wolverine, and having worked with SHIELD for a while, though it was unclear where exactly these events fit in with her history and also whether Jean had access to the Phoenix Force. Amalgam Comics In the Amalgam Comics community, Jean Grey was combined with DC's Fire to create Firebird. She was part of the JLX until the Dark Firebird Saga where she joined the Hellfire League of Injustice. Exiles On the Exiles's second mission lands them in the middle of an alternative reality Dark Phoenix Saga. The team learns that in this world Jean actually is the Dark Phoenix, and they participate in the Shiar trial by combat, disguised as representatives of the world she destroyed. Originally, their goal is to prevent the Shiar Imperial Guard from killing Jean before she can overcome the Dark Phoenix, however when Jean vaporizes Storm, Gladiator, and Cyclops, they realize that this version of Jean has lost herself to the Dark Phoenix and must die. They are able to overwhelm her momentarily, allowing Wolverine to get close enough to stab her through the heart, resulting in an explosion that kills her and vaporizes the moon and the Shiar ships orbiting it. The Exiles are removed from this reality, right before the blast.Exiles #3–4 New Exiles After the New Exiles land on the world of warring empires, they encounter Dame Emma Frost, head of Britain's Department X and founder of Force-X. This team includes John Grey, a male version of Jean who is codenamed Sunspot and displays telekinetic abilities.New Exiles #9 Red Queen A counterpart of Jean Grey from Earth-9575, who had most of her powers taken away for crimes unknown and for that reason it is not clear whether she had access to the Phoenix Force.Red Queen (Jean Grey) at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe Banished from her own universe, she ended up on Earth-998, where she pretended to be a reincarnation of the recently deceased Queen Madelyne. Jean then set out to become not only queen of Britain but of the entire world. To reach that goal and find a way of restoring her powers, she looked for the ultimate weapon across the multiverse: the various incarnations of Nate Grey. She lured many of them to her kingdom, though most of them died after having been used by her for a while. Queen Jean also traveled to the main 616 universe where she replaced Nate Grey's companion, Madelyne Pryor, wormed her way into Nate's mind, and returned to her world with him as her weapon. However, Nate broke free and fought against her, culminating in her draining the life-force of all her \\"subjects\\" in an attempt to use the power to kill him. He eventually kills her by creating a sun around her, burning her to death.X-Man #70 Ironically some time later, Madelyne Pryor herself would use the \\"Red Queen\\" moniker.Uncanny X-Men #503 Ruins A young prostitute in Washington, D.C., Jean was gunned down by Nick Fury after soliciting him. Shadow-X New Excalibur battles an evil counterpart of the Jean Grey, who is a member of the Shadow-X, the X-Men of an alternative reality in which Professor X was possessed by the Shadow King. They are brought to Earth-616 as a result of M-Day. This counterpart of Jean seemed to have access to the Phoenix Force too. In New Excalibur #24 she was stabbed in the shoulder with a broadsword by Petrie, one of Albion's Shadow Captains (de- powered mutants given ability-enhancing suits). After beating him, she used her power to gain the knowledge necessary to deactivate the device Albion had used to nullify London's supply of electricity. The energy required to perform this, as well as the blood loss caused by the stab wound, killed her.New Excalibur #24 Ultimate Marvel In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Jean Grey is a responsible, but extroverted young woman; scathingly sarcastic and a bit of a tease, and she secretly reads other people's minds, particularly the other members of the X-Men. Early in the series, she has very short, cropped hair and prefers to dress in a rocker type style. Eventually, she becomes more mature and wears clothes that are more conservative, and grows her hair somewhat longer. She has a brief affair with Wolverine, but when Wolverine reveals how he was originally sent to kill Professor X, Jean is angry and ends the relationship. She later begins to date Cyclops although she is occasionally frustrated by his shyness. Xavier found Jean Grey while she was in a mental hospital, having problems controlling her telepathy and having troublesome visions of a Phoenix raptor. It is established at the start of the series that her age is 19. She was Xavier's second student after Cyclops. The exact nature of the Phoenix in the Ultimate Universe has not been revealed, but very often Jean is haunted by visions and hallucinations of the Phoenix early in the Ultimate timeline. The powers seem to reveal themselves when Jean gets angry. It appears, due to tests conducted in Ultimate X-Men #71, that the Phoenix is an actual entity and not an uncovered aspect of Jean's own mind. According to the Fire and Brimstone story arc, Jean's Phoenix powers come from the Phoenix God, although Xavier does not believe this. Jean kills many members of the Hellfire club in a fit of Phoenix powered rage before Xavier calms her down. Much later in the story, Jean uses her Phoenix powers often. She starts with her powers out of her control due to her anger, accidentally killing two mercenaries who were attacking the X-Men. She feels guilty over the incident for weeks, but after a while, she manifests signs of the Phoenix, beginning to draw upon more and more of the residual Phoenix energies buried within her mind to help the X-Men on several occasions, combating Magneto and the deceptive and manipulative Magician. It has been revealed that Jean envisions imaginary tiny, green goblins carrying out her telekinetic activities. When the man from the future, Cable, attacks the X-Men, he kidnaps Jean Grey, but she is later rescued by the X-Men and Bishop. After Professor X's apparent death, Jean has become the headmistress of the school, along with Cyclops. She did not join Bishop's new team of X-Men, but has assisted the team when needed, often butting heads with Cyclops over when to help and when not to help. Further down the line, The X-Men hunt Sinister down, finding him in the Morlock tunnels slaughtering several Morlocks in order to reach his goal; to be reborn as Apocalypse. He has the power to control mutants and brings former X-Men Cyclops, Jean, Iceman, Rogue, and Toad to NYC for a giant survival battle royal. The Fantastic Four intercept Cyclops' team, where Sue Storm traps Jean in a force field, rendering her a mere spectator. Jean is broken free of the bubble when Professor X, able to walk, uses his telepathy to free her and the other reserve X-Men, leaving her to subdue the other team of X-Men and the Morlocks. She hesitantly calls for help when Apocalypse puts Xavier on the brink of death and the Phoenix Force responds, physically manifesting herself and merging with Jean to fight Apocalypse.Ultimate X-Men #92 Using her unimaginable powers, she brings Apocalypse to his knees and melts his armor. Having fully merged with the Phoenix, Jean reverts recent history, allowing the X-Men to remember. She then travels across the universe, causing war and suicide among different races. When she reaches her destination, the Silver Surfer arrives to warn her but she pushes on to find Heaven. Jean later inexplicably turns up at the Mansion and resettles with the X-Men. When Alpha Flight kidnaps Northstar, Jean strives to push the X-Men to fight harder, especially when Cyclops leaves to protect Colossus, Rogue, Dazzler, and Angel, who were using Banshee to rescue Northstar. Unfortunately, they believe they've failed and become Banshee addicts. Jean leads her X-Men to deal with Colossus but falls into a trance, having visions of her father, who tells her not to push her friends to failure. She recovers Northstar, crippled from the waist down, and less aggressive. Everyone but Scott returns home, so Jean tracks him into space, where he is staring down at Earth, feeling omnipotent. Jean reminds him he's in need, provoking him into attacking her. During the ensuing fight Banshee were wears off and Scott almost succumbs to vacuum. Jean encompassed him in her fire. During the events of the Ultimate Marvel crossover event Ultimatum, Magneto's Manhattan tidal wave kills Nightcrawler and Dazzler. Scott, Jean, and Logan go as the \\"original X-Men\\" to stop Magneto once and for all. The remaining X-Men along with the Fantastic Four, Ultimates, and SHIELD assault Magneto's base, during which they lose several more members including Wolverine, who has his Adamantium ripped from his bones by Magneto. In the end Magneto is defeated when Jean downloads Nick Fury's memories into Magneto, which reveals that mutants are not the next stage of human evolution, but rather a super-soldier experiment gone wrong. Horrified by the truth, Magneto surrenders, and Cyclops executes him with his optic blast. Soon after, Jean is in Washington with the remaining X-Men, where Cyclops makes a speech, attempting to bring peace to the anti-mutant hostilities and to ask that all mutants surrender to the government. He is then assassinated by Quicksilver, who lodges a bullet into his skull. Scott dies in the arms of Storm and Colossus, while Rogue rushes a distraught Jean to safety. Jean is later seen in Ultimate X-Men Requiem alongside Rogue and Iceman tearing down the Xavier Institute and everything on the estate. They bury the bodies of the various deceased X-Men on the estate's remains. Jean then moves to Baltimore, dying her hair black under the alias of Karen Grant. She begins working at a shopping mall called Cherry Square Shopping Center, and is now in a relationship with the mall cop, Dave. She has been living in Baltimore for 3 or 4 months but uses her telepathy to make people believe she had worked there for 3 years. Jean discovers that Dave has put her photo on Facebook, making her angry and culminating in separation. Not much later Mystique and Sabretooth show up and a fight starts, leaving Dave dead. Meanwhile, at home, packing up to disappear, Jean meets the son of Wolverine, Jimmy, for the first time.Ultimate Comics X #2 Jean is later seen travelling with Jimmy to Chicago to recruit a mutant known as Derek Morgan, then to south California to locate Liz Allan. One night, Jimmy is attacked by Sabretooth. Jean had sought Bruce Banner for help and a fight ensues. Quicksilver then arrives with his newly formed Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy, but is defeated by Jean and her recruits. Nicholas Fury reveals that the team Jean made was part of the Xavior Protocols, and that he is willing to help mutants on the run from the government. He later enlists them in S.H.I.E.L.D., forming a group known as the Ultimate X. Jean and her team are seen en route to the SEAR to aid Hawkeye. After witnessing the heaven created by the Xorn/Zorn brothers in Tian, Ultimate X group deserts, deciding to remain there. Nick Fury reveals that Jean is using her telekinetic powers to make the brothers believe she is in Tian in order to have an \\"inside man\\" when she is really in America. However, a recent meeting between Karen and Zorn implies that she may be double crossing Fury, as she is physically in Tian as well as revealing her real identity as Jean Grey. She sends a spy to keep tabs on what Kitty is up to with Reservation X. What If? In What If #27, Jean Grey was not the last X-Man standing during the fight with the Imperial Guard and was successfully 'lobotomised', remaining with the X-Men as mansion staff, eventually re-manifesting her powers when a mission to aid the Shi'ar forced the X-Men to fight Galactus so that Jean could drive him away. Although she appeared redeemed from her past, her Phoenix persona secretly manifested itself at night to feed on dead worlds and uninhabited stars until Jean was confronted about her actions, her resulting anger when discovered causing her to lash out and accidentally kill the X-Men, her guilt and grief result in her consuming the entire universe as the entire Phoenix was unleashed. Another version of Phoenix remained powerless and happily married to Cyclops until an attack by Mastermind caused her to remember her true origin, prompting her to kill the original Jean Grey to keep her new life. Although she tried to help the X-Men in secret, she was eventually convinced to leave Earth when Destiny told her that only death and destruction would result if she remained on Earth.What If? vol.2 #32–33 =What If? X-Men: Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire: Vulcan becomes the Phoenix= Vulcan ends up inside the M'kraan Crystal instead of Professor X, and from there he gained the power of the Phoenix Force after entering the White Hot Room and killing all the Phoenix's hosts. Using the Phoenix Force he destroys seven galaxies, the entire Annihilation Wave, the Shi'ar and Kree Empires before travelling to Earth. Using the Phoenix Force, he restores Krakoa before engaging in battle with Cyclops, Havok, Rachel and Cable. Vulcan appears to be winning until a strange outside force causes Vulcan to lose control of the Phoenix Force. After a brief mental battle between Vulcan and his family, Vulcan accepts his defeat by letting go of the rage and hate inside him as he dies. As the host of the Phoenix Force, Vulcan travels to the White Hot Room, where he reverts to the form of a child, and is comforted by the strange force who reveals to Gabriel that wielding the ultimate power would not give him what he truly wanted, which was the wish of being loved. The force then reveals herself to be Jean Grey, White Phoenix of the Crown. As she reclaims the power from Vulcan it's revealed that it was Jean that had helped Rachel and Havok escape from the Shi'ar Empire by opening a teleportation portal to Earth before the Empire's fall at the hands of Vulcan, and it was her that prevented Vulcan from fully accessing the Phoenix Force in Krakoa. X-Men Noir In X-Men Noir, Jean Grey is depicted as the grifter for the X-Men, a group of sociopathic teenagers recruited by Professor Charles Xavier. Adept at running scams, she had a reputation of controlling the minds of men. She is seemingly found murdered, covered in slash marks, in the opening of the series.X-Men Noir #1 It is revealed later, however, that the victim was in fact Anne-Marie Rankin, whom Jean switched places with in order to collect the millions Anne- Marie was to inherit. She is also revealed to be a complete sociopath, who does what she does not because of any past trauma, but because that's just what she is. She then dies when she is tackled off the roof of a building by Robert Halloway.X-Men Noir #4 X-Men Forever In Chris Claremont's X-Men Forever, Jean is in nearly all respects the same character as the mainline Marvel Universe character.Interview with Chris Claremont at ComixMix News \\"No, it's the Marvel Universe, there's no real change to it, other than the fact that in a very practical sense that the subsequent sixteen, seventeen years of material following my departure doesn't exist.\\" Her flirtations with Logan are explored more in-depth in the first few issues of the title, and she confesses shortly after Logan's death that she loved him.X-Men Forever #3 She and Scott both recognize their romantic relationship is over, due to the revelations.X-Men Forever #5 Claremont has also shown that Jean still possesses the Phoenix Force, and has manifested it twice, once in the first issue to subdue Fabian Cortez after he has apparently killed Logan and Kitty Pryde,X-Men Forever #1 and again to attack Storm in retaliation for her killing of Logan. She has, recently, been acknowledged as the field leader of the team during Cyclops' leave of absence.in X-Men Forever #11, Beast explicitly refers to her as such. Jean continues to demonstrate signs of the Phoenix Force and wears a new blue and gold X-Men uniform which is cut in a similar style to her old Phoenix costume. After dealing with Logan's loss Jean began a relationship with the Beast but it ended after he sacrificed himself. With Cyclops's return, Jean began to share leadership of the X-Men with him and eventually she would be reunited with the true Storm. In the finale of the series, it is hinted that she and Scott resume their relationship. Prelude to Deadpool Corps In the second issue, Deadpool visits a world where Jean and Rogue are orphaned kids at an orphanage run by Emma Frost. There they go to a dance along with Prof. X's Orphanage for Troubled kids. It seems at a young age she has a thing for Cyclops but tells him to wait 20 years. Battle of the Atom The Jean Grey of the future- established as the temporally- displaced young Jean Grey grown up- is depicted as a very powerful mutant who has to wear the Xorn mask to contain her powers, capable of removing it for only a few minutes before becoming dangerous to her environment. She is destroyed in a clash with the original five X-Men, including her younger self. Charles Xavier II, the new leader of the displaced Brotherhood, attempts to attack the team using a psychic illusion of Xorn, but this deception is exposed by the young Jean. X-Men: No More Humans When Raze – the future son of Wolverine and Mystique, now trapped in the present, attempted to force the X-Men to accept his new 'status quo' by teleporting all humans off Earth and summoning other mutants from worlds where they were being oppressed, one of the mutants he summoned to be a member of his new Brotherhood was a Jean Grey who was still in her 'Dark Phoenix' state, barely under the control of her world's Mastermind. However, when she confronted the temporally-displaced Jean Grey, the younger Jean was able to appeal to her Dark Phoenix self to help them undo Raze's actions and save the displaced humans while also creating a new Earth in a pocket dimension for the refugee mutants.X-Men: No More Humans References Category:Fictional characters from parallel universes ","title":"Alternative versions of Jean Grey"},{"id":"22760940","text":"Yi County or Yixian () is a county in west-central Liaoning Province, China, and is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Jinzhou.

It was developed and published by Dr S. Eio of Staffordshire University (United Kingdom) in 2007.  Background  The Turn-OFF switching transient of silicon-based power bipolar semiconductor devices, caused by stored charge in the device during the forward conduction state, limits switching speed of the device, which in turn limits the efficiency of the application it is used within. Different techniques, such as carrier lifetime control, injection efficiency and buffer layer devices, have been used to minimize turn-OFF switching transient, but all result in a trade-off between the ON-state loss and switching speed.  Details of the Technique  The current injection technique examined in Dr Eio's publications optimize the switching transient of power diodes, thyristors and insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) without the need of changing the structure of these devices. To implement the current injection technique, current injection circuit was developed with results indicating that the injection of an additional current during its switching transient can reduce the reverse recovery charge of a given power diode and thyristor, and also reduce the tail current of insulated gate bipolar transistors. Practical experimental results on diodes and thyristors showed that the amplitude of the injected current required is proportional to the peak reverse recovery current and proved that these devices experience a momentary increase in recombination of current carriers during the injection of the additional current. This help to prevent the device from conducting large negative current, which in turn reduce its reverse recovery charge and reverse recovery time. Results obtained from experiments with insulated gate bipolar transistors showed a significant reduction in the time where current falls to zero when opposing current was injected into the device during its turn-off transient. Further simulation results from numerical modeling showed that the injected opposing current temporary increase recombination in the device and therefore reduce the extracted excess carriers that stored within the device. To prevent circuit commutation and bonding between the current injection circuit and the main test circuit where the device under test (DUT) is connected to, non-invasive circuit was developed to magnetically couple the two circuits. In summary, current injection technique makes it possible to use devices with low forward voltage drop for high frequency applications. This also imply cheaper cost of devices as less processing steps are required during the manufacturing stages where the need of carrier lifetime control techniques are reduced. This removed the need for the semiconductor device used in the current injection circuit to have high breakdown voltage rating and also provided electrical isolation. Typical application of this technique in an inductive load chopper circuit showed a significant reduction in the tail current of insulated gate bipolar transistors, and the reverse recovery time and charge of the freewheeling diode used.

It involves the analysis of language form, language meaning, and language in context. Linguists traditionally analyse human language by observing an interplay between sound and meaning. Linguistics also deals with the social, cultural, historical, and political factors that influence language, through which linguistic and language-based context is often determined. Research on language through the sub-branches of historical and evolutionary linguistics also focuses on how languages change and grow, particularly over an extended period of time. The earliest activities in the documentation and description of language have been attributed to the 6th-century-BC Indian grammarian Pāṇini who wrote a formal description of the Sanskrit language in his '. Related areas of study include the disciplines of semiotics (the study of direct and indirect language through signs and symbols), literary criticism (the historical and ideological analysis of literature, cinema, art, or published material), translation (the conversion and documentation of meaning in written/spoken text from one language or dialect onto another), and speech-language pathology (a corrective method to cure phonetic disabilities and disfunctions at the cognitive level).  Major subdisciplines  Historical linguistics = John shares a common origin with Shaun, Eoin, Ian, Juan, Ivan, and Yahya. More surprisingly, the Catalan words Joan ‹John› and xoni ‹Vulgar girl› are also related. They have all come from the Biblical Hebrew phrase God is gracious, over 30 centuries of evolution. Historical linguistics tries to analyze such changes and their links, and even recreate disappeared forms through comparing those that are known. Historical linguistics is the study of language change over time particularly with regards to a specific language or group of languages. Historical linguistics was among the first sub-disciplines to emerge in linguistics, and was the most widely practised form of linguistics in the late 19th century. There was a shift of focus in the early twentieth century to the synchronic approach (the systemic study of the current stage in languages), but historical research remained a field of linguistic inquiry. Subfields include language change and grammaticalisation studies. Western modern historical linguistics dates from the late 18th century. It grew out of the earlier discipline of philology, the study of ancient texts and documents dating back to antiquity. At first, historical linguistics served as the cornerstone of comparative linguistics primarily as a tool for linguistic reconstruction.\\"Editors' Introduction: Foundations of the new historical linguistics.\\" In. The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics Routledge p. 25. Scholars were concerned chiefly with establishing language families and reconstructing prehistoric proto-languages, using the comparative method and internal reconstruction. The focus was initially on the well-known Indo- European languages, many of which had long written histories; the scholars also studied the Uralic languages, another European language family for which less early written material exists. Since then, there has been significant comparative linguistic work expanding outside of European languages as well, such as on the Austronesian languages and various families of Native American languages, among many others. Comparative linguistics is now, however, only a part of a more broadly conceived discipline of historical linguistics. For the Indo-European languages, comparative study is now a highly specialized field. Most research is being carried out on the subsequent development of these languages, in particular, the development of the modern standard varieties. Some scholars have undertaken studies attempting to establish super-families, linking, for example, Indo-European, Uralic, and other families into Nostratic. These attempts have not been accepted widely. The information necessary to establish relatedness becomes less available as the time depth is increased. The time-depth of linguistic methods is limited due to chance word resemblances and variations between language groups, but a limit of around 10,000 years is often assumed. p. 11. The dating of the various proto- languages is also difficult; several methods are available for dating, but only approximate results can be obtained. = Syntax and morphology= Syntax and morphology are branches of linguistics concerned with the order and structure of meaningful linguistic units such as words and morphemes. Syntacticians study the rules and constraints that govern how speakers of a language can organize words into sentences. Morphologists study similar rules for the order of morphemes—sub-word units such as prefixes and suffixes—and how they may be combined to form words. While words, along with clitics, are generally accepted as being the smallest units of syntax, in most languages, if not all, many words can be related to other words by rules that collectively describe the grammar for that language. For example, English speakers recognize that the words dog and dogs are closely related, differentiated only by the plurality morpheme \\"-s\\", only found bound to noun phrases. Speakers of English, a fusional language, recognize these relations from their innate knowledge of English's rules of word formation. They infer intuitively that dog is to dogs as cat is to cats; and, in similar fashion, dog is to dog catcher as dish is to dishwasher. By contrast, Classical Chinese has very little morphology, using almost exclusively unbound morphemes (\\"free\\" morphemes) and depending on word order to convey meaning. (Most words in modern Standard Chinese [\\"Mandarin\\"], however, are compounds and most roots are bound.) These are understood as grammars that represent the morphology of the language. The rules understood by a speaker reflect specific patterns or regularities in the way words are formed from smaller units in the language they are using, and how those smaller units interact in speech. In this way, morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies patterns of word formation within and across languages and attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of the speakers of those languages. Phonological and orthographic modifications between a base word and its origin may be partial to literacy skills. Studies have indicated that the presence of modification in phonology and orthography makes morphologically complex words harder to understand and that the absence of modification between a base word and its origin makes morphologically complex words easier to understand. Morphologically complex words are easier to comprehend when they include a base word. Polysynthetic languages, such as Chukchi, have words composed of many morphemes. The Chukchi word \\"təmeyŋəlevtpəγtərkən\\", for example, meaning \\"I have a fierce headache\\", is composed of eight morphemes t-ə-meyŋ-ə-levt- pəγt-ə-rkən that may be glossed. The morphology of such languages allows for each consonant and vowel to be understood as morphemes, while the grammar of the language indicates the usage and understanding of each morpheme. The discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is morphophonology. = Semantics and pragmatics = Semantics and pragmatics are branches of linguistics concerned with meaning. These subfields have traditionally been divided by the role of linguistic and social context in the determination of meaning. Semantics in this conception is concerned with core meanings and pragmatics concerned with meaning in context. Pragmatics encompasses speech act theory, conversational implicature, talk in interaction and other approaches to language behavior in philosophy, sociology, linguistics and anthropology.Mey, Jacob L. (1993) Pragmatics: An Introduction. Oxford: Blackwell (2nd ed. 2001). Unlike semantics, which examines meaning that is conventional or \\"coded\\" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge (grammar, lexicon, etc.) of the speaker and listener but also on the context of the utterance, any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the inferred intent of the speaker, and other factors. In that respect, pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent ambiguity since meaning relies on the manner, place, time, etc. of an utterance. = Phonetics and phonology = Phonetics and phonology are branches of linguistics concerned with sounds (or the equivalent aspects of sign languages). Phonetics is largely concerned with the physical aspects of sounds such as their acoustics, production, and perception. Phonology is concerned with the linguistic abstractions and categorizations of sounds.  Language varieties  Languages exist on a wide continuum of conventionalization with blurry divisions between concepts such as dialects and languages. Languages can undergo internal changes which lead to the development of subvarieties such as linguistic registers, accents, and dialects. Similarly, languages can undergo changes caused by contact with speakers of other languages, and new language varieties may be born from these contact situations through the process of language genesis. = Contact varieties = Contact varieties such as pidgins and creoles are language varieties that often arise in situations of sustained contact between communities that speak different languages. Pidgins are language varieties with limited conventionalization where ideas are conveyed through simplified grammars that may grow more complex as linguistic contact continues. Creole languages are language varieties similar to pidgins but with greater conventionalization and stability. As children grow up in contact situations, they may learn a local pidgin as their native language. Through this process of acquisition and transmission, new grammatical features and lexical items are created and introduced to fill gaps in the pidgin eventually developing into a complete language. Not all language contact situations result in the development of a pidgin or creole, and researchers have studied the features of contact situations that make contact varieties more likely to develop. Often these varieties arise in situations of colonization and enslavement, where power imbalances prevent the contact groups from learning the other's language but sustained contact is nevertheless maintained. The subjugated language in the power relationship is the substrate language, while the dominant language serves as the superstrate. Often the words and lexicon of a contact variety come from the superstrate, making it the lexifier, while grammatical structures come from the substrate, but this is not always the case. = Dialect = A dialect is a variety of language that is characteristic of a particular group among the language's speakers.Oxford English dictionary. The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a register or a discourse, where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons. Other times, dialects remain marginalized, particularly when they are associated with marginalized social groups. Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that \\"a language is a dialect with an army and navy\\" is attributed as a definition formulated by Max Weinreich. > \\"We may as individuals be rather fond of our own dialect. This should not > make us think, though, that it is actually any better than any other > dialect. Dialects are not good or bad, nice or nasty, right or wrong – they > are just different from one another, and it is the mark of a civilised > society that it tolerates different dialects just as it tolerates different > races, religions and sexes.\\"Trudgill, P. (1994). Dialects. Ebooks Online > Routledge. Florence, KY. =Standard language= When a dialect is documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its grammar, which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country or region's policies. That is the stage when a language is considered a standard variety, one whose grammatical laws have now stabilised from within the consent of speech community participants, after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, and growth. The English language, besides perhaps the French language, may be examples of languages that have arrived at a stage where they are said to have become standard varieties. =Relativity= As constructed popularly through the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, relativists believe that the structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her world view. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, it was Sapir's student Harry Hoijer who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist Leo Weisgerber also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of cognitive linguistics in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like George Lakoff have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language Jacques Derrida's writings, especially about deconstruction, have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, for which he was heavily criticized in the media at the time of his death. Structures Linguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form. Any particular pairing of meaning and form is a Saussurean sign. For instance, the meaning \\"cat\\" is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands and face (in sign languages), and written symbols (in written languages). Linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the knowledge engineering field especially with the ever-increasing amount of available data. Linguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously). All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis. For instance, consider the structure of the word \\"tenth\\" on two different levels of analysis. On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word \\"tenth\\" is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality. The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker \\"th\\" follows the number \\"ten.\\" On the level of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the \\"n\\" sound in \\"tenth\\" is made differently from the \\"n\\" sound in \\"ten\\" spoken alone. Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of \\"tenth\\", they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure. Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language. =Grammar= Grammar is a system of rules which governs the production and use of utterances in a given language. These rules apply to soundAll references in this article to the study of sound should be taken to include the manual and non-manual signs used in sign languages. as well as meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to phonology (the organisation of phonetic sound systems), morphology (the formation and composition of words), and syntax (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences). Modern frameworks that deal with the principles of grammar include structural and functional linguistics, and generative linguistics.Syntax: A Generative Introduction (Second Edition), 2013. Andrew Carnie. Blackwell Publishing. Sub-fields that focus on a grammatical study of language include the following. * Phonetics, the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception, and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties * Phonology, the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning (phonemes) * Morphology, the study of morphemes, or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified * Syntax, the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and sentences * Semantics, the study of the meaning of words (lexical semantics) and fixed word combinations (phraseology), and how these combine to form the meanings of sentences as well as manage and resolve ambiguity. * Pragmatics, the study of how utterances are used in communicative acts, and the role played by situational context and non- linguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning * Discourse analysis, the analysis of language use in texts (spoken, written, or signed) * Stylistics, the study of linguistic factors (rhetoric, diction, stress) that place a discourse in context * Semiotics, the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication =Discourse= Discourse is language as social practice (Baynham, 1995) and is a multilayered concept. As a social practice, discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts. Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies. Discourse influences genre, which is chosen in response to different situations and finally, at micro level, discourse influences language as text (spoken or written) at the phonological or lexico-grammatical level. Grammar and discourse are linked as parts of a system. A particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose, and is referred to as a register.Helen Leckie-Tarry, Language and Context: a Functional Linguistic Theory of Register, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995, p. 6\\\\. There may be certain lexical additions (new words) that are brought into play because of the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization. Registers and discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of vocabulary, and at times through the use of style too. People in the medical fraternity, for example, may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine. This is often referred to as being part of the \\"medical discourse\\", and so on. =Lexicon= The lexicon is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of words and bound morphemes, which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like affixes. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. Lexicography, closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an encyclopedia or a dictionary. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization, and the new words are called neologisms. It is often believed that a speaker's capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon. However, this is often considered a myth by linguists. The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar, and to be linked with competence, rather than with the growth of vocabulary. Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences. =Style= Stylistics also involves the study of written, signed, or spoken discourse through varying speech communities, genres, and editorial or narrative formats in the mass media. It involves the study and interpretation of texts for aspects of their linguistic and tonal style. Stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular dialects and registers used by speech communities. Stylistic features include rhetoric, diction, stress, satire, irony, dialogue, and other forms of phonetic variations. Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well. It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community. In short, Stylistics is the interpretation of text. In the 1960s, Jacques Derrida, for instance, further distinguished between speech and writing, by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself.Writing and Difference by Jacques Derrida, 1967, and Of Grammatology Palaeography is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts (as signs and symbols) in language.Chapter 1, section 1.1 in The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like psycholinguistics, which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; neurolinguistics, which studies language processing in the brain; biolinguistics, which studies the biology and evolution of language; and language acquisition, which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages. ApproachesHumanistic= The fundamental principle of humanistic linguistics is that language is an invention created by people. A semiotic tradition of linguistic research considers language a sign system which arises as from the interaction of meaning and form. The organisation of linguistic levels is considered computational. Linguistics is essentially seen as relating to social and cultural studies because different languages are shaped in social interaction by the speech community. Frameworks representing the humanistic view of language include structural linguistics, among others. Structural analysis means dissecting each linguistic level: phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and discourse, to the smallest units. These are collected into inventories (e.g. phoneme, morpheme, lexical classes, phrase types) to study their interconnectedness within a hierarchy of structures and layers. Functional analysis adds to structural analysis the assignment of semantic and other functional roles that each unit may have. For example, a noun phrase may function as the subject or object of the sentence; or the agent or patient. Functional linguistics, or functional grammar, is a branch of structural linguistics. In the humanistic reference, the terms structuralism and functionalism are related to their meaning in other human sciences. The difference between formal and functional structuralism lies in the way that the two approaches explain why languages have the properties they have. Functional explanation entails the idea that language is a tool for communication, or that communication is the primary function of language. Linguistic forms are consequently explained by an appeal to their functional value, or usefulness. Other structuralist approaches take the perspective that form follows from the inner mechanisms of the bilateral and multilayered language system. =Biological= Other linguistics frameworks take as their starting point the notion that language is a biological phenomenon in humans. Generative Grammar is the study of an innate linguistic structure. In contrast to structural linguistics, Generative Grammar rejects the notion that meaning or social interaction affects language. Instead, all human languages are based on a crystallised structure which may have been caused by a mutation exclusively in humans. The study of linguistics is considered as the study of this hypothesised structure. Cognitive Linguistics, in contrast, rejects the notion of innate grammar, and studies how the human brain creates linguistic constructions from event schemas, and the impact of cognitive constraints and biases on human language. Similarly to neuro-linguistic programming, language is approached via the senses. Cognitive linguists study the embodiment of knowledge by seeking expressions which relate to modal schemas. A closely related approach is evolutionary linguistics which includes the study of linguistic units as cultural replicators. It is possible to study how language replicates and adapts to the mind of the individual or the speech community. Construction grammar is a framework which applies the meme concept to the study of syntax. The generative versus evolutionary approach are sometimes called formalism and functionalism, respectively. This reference is however different from the use of the terms in human sciences. Methodology Linguistics is primarily descriptive. Linguists describe and explain features of language without making subjective judgments on whether a particular feature or usage is \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\". This is analogous to practice in other sciences: a zoologist studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" than another. Prescription, on the other hand, is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or \\"acrolect\\". This may have the aim of establishing a linguistic standard, which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see Linguistic imperialism). An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among censors, who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in language instruction, like in ELT, where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical items need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to acquire the language. =Anthropology= The objective of describing languages is often to uncover cultural knowledge about communities. The use of anthropological methods of investigation on linguistic sources leads to the discovery of certain cultural traits among a speech community through its linguistic features. It is also widely used as a tool in language documentation, with an endeavour to curate endangered languages. However, linguistic inquiry now uses the anthropological method to understand cognitive, historical, sociolinguistic and historical processes that languages undergo as they change and evolve, as well as general anthropological inquiry uses the linguistic method to excavate into culture. In all aspects, anthropological inquiry usually uncovers the different variations and relativities that underlie the usage of language. =Sources= Most contemporary linguists work under the assumption that spoken data and signed data are more fundamental than written data. This is because * Speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it, while there have been many cultures and speech communities that lack written communication; * Features appear in speech which aren't always recorded in writing, including phonological rules, sound changes, and speech errors; * All natural writing systems reflect a spoken language (or potentially a signed one), even with pictographic scripts like Dongba writing Naxi homophones with the same pictogram, and text in writing systems used for two languages changing to fit the spoken language being recorded; * Speech evolved before human beings invented writing; * Individuals learn to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they do with writing. Nonetheless, linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable. For research that relies on corpus linguistics and computational linguistics, written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically transcribed and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of computer-mediated communication as a viable site for linguistic inquiry. The study of writing systems themselves, graphemics, is, in any case, considered a branch of linguistics. =Analysis= Before the 20th century, linguists analysed language on a diachronic plane, which was historical in focus. This meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later. However, with Saussurean linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more synchronic approach, where the study was more geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time. At another level, the syntagmatic plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced, within the syntax of a sentence. For example, the article \\"the\\" is followed by a noun, because of the syntagmatic relation between the words. The paradigmatic plane on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based on the paradigms or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case, words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding. History Elias Lönnrot (1802–1884) was a linguist who made long journeys collecting and compiling lyric poems and folk ballads from different parts of the land (mainly in Karelia) into an epic collection called the Kalevala,Elias Lönnrot (1802 - 1884) which is later known, for example, to have partly inspired the author J. R. R. Tolkien to create his own legendarium.Kullervo: Tolkien's fascination with Finland - BBC =Nomenclature= Before the 20th century, the term philology, first attested in 1716, was commonly used to refer to the study of language, which was then predominantly historical in focus. Since Ferdinand de Saussure's insistence on the importance of synchronic analysis, however, this focus has shifted and the term philology is now generally used for the \\"study of a language's grammar, history, and literary tradition\\", especially in the United States (where philology has never been very popularly considered as the \\"science of language\\"). Although the term \\"linguist\\" in the sense of \\"a student of language\\" dates from 1641, the term \\"linguistics\\" is first attested in 1847. It is now the usual term in English for the scientific study of language, though linguistic science is sometimes used. Linguistics is a multi-disciplinary field of research that combines tools from natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities. Many linguists, such as David Crystal, conceptualize the field as being primarily scientific. The term linguist applies to someone who studies language or is a researcher within the field, or to someone who uses the tools of the discipline to describe and analyse specific languages. =Early grammarians= The formal study of language began in India with Pāṇini, the 6th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology. Pāṇini's systematic classification of the sounds of Sanskrit into consonants and vowels, and word classes, such as nouns and verbs, was the first known instance of its kind. In the Middle East, Sibawayh, a Persian, made a detailed description of Arabic in AD 760 in his monumental work, Al-kitab fi al-nahw (, The Book on Grammar), the first known author to distinguish between sounds and phonemes (sounds as units of a linguistic system). Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East,. but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early interest in language in the West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic theory were made by Plato in his Cratylus dialogue, where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the first to use the word etymology to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around 280 BC, one of Alexander the Great's successors founded a university (see Musaeum) in Alexandria, where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught Greek to speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word \\"grammar\\" in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as \\"téchnē grammatikḗ\\" (), the \\"art of writing\\", which is also the title of one of the most important works of the Alexandrine school by Dionysius Thrax. Throughout the Middle Ages, the study of language was subsumed under the topic of philology, the study of ancient languages and texts, practised by such educators as Roger Ascham, Wolfgang Ratke, and John Amos Comenius.. =Comparative philology= In the 18th century, the first use of the comparative method by William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics.. Bloomfield attributes \\"the first great scientific linguistic work of the world\\" to Jacob Grimm, who wrote Deutsche Grammatik.. It was soon followed by other authors writing similar comparative studies on other language groups of Europe. The study of language was broadened from Indo- European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt, of whom Bloomfield asserts: > This study received its foundation at the hands of the Prussian statesman > and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835), especially in the first volume > of his work on Kavi, the literary language of Java, entitled Über die > Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einfluß auf die > geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts (On the Variety of the > Structure of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of > the Human Race). =20th century developments= There was a shift of focus from historical and comparative linguistics to synchronic analysis in early 20th century. Structural analysis was improved by Leonard Bloomfield, Louis Hjelmslev; and Zellig Harris who also developed methods of discourse analysis. Functional analysis was developed by the Prague linguistic circle and André Martinet. As sound recording devices became commonplace in the 1960s, dialectal recordings were made and archived, and the audio-lingual method provided a technological solution to foreign language learning. The 1960s also saw a new rise of comparative linguistics: the study of language universals in linguistic typology. Towards the end of the century the field of linguistics became divided into further areas of interest with the advent of language technology and digitalised corpora. Areas of researchEcolinguistics= Ecolinguistics explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and biodiversity loss to environmental justice. =Sociolinguistics= Sociolinguistics is the study of how language is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and idiolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research both style and discourse in language, as well as the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society. =Developmental linguistics= Developmental linguistics is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly the acquisition of language in childhood. Some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into is how children acquire different languages, how adults can acquire a second language, and what the process of language acquisition is. =Neurolinguistics= Neurolinguistics is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics, and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using aphasiology, brain imaging, electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language. =Applied linguistics= Linguists are largely concerned with finding and describing the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages. Applied linguistics takes the results of those findings and \\"applies\\" them to other areas. Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as language education, lexicography, translation, language planning, which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use, and natural language processing. \\"Applied linguistics\\" has been argued to be something of a misnomer. Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real-world linguistic problems, and not literally \\"applying\\" existing technical knowledge from linguistics. Moreover, they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as sociology (e.g., conversation analysis) and anthropology. (Constructed language fits under Applied linguistics.) Today, computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics. Speech synthesis and speech recognition use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide voice interfaces to computers. Applications of computational linguistics in machine translation, computer-assisted translation, and natural language processing are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints. Linguistic analysis is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed nationality of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim. This often takes the form of an interview by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's native language through an interpreter or in an international lingua franca like English. Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved. Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker. =Semiotics= Semiotics is the study of sign processes (semiosis), or signification and communication, signs, and symbols, both individually and grouped into sign systems, including the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians often do not restrict themselves to linguistic communication when studying the use of signs but extend the meaning of \\"sign\\" to cover all kinds of cultural symbols. Nonetheless, semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are literary studies, discourse analysis, text linguistics, and philosophy of language. Semiotics, within the linguistics paradigm, is the study of the relationship between language and culture. Historically, Edward Sapir and Ferdinand De Saussure's structuralist theories influenced the study of signs extensively until the late part of the 20th century, but later, post-modern and post-structural thought, through language philosophers including Jacques Derrida, Mikhail Bakhtin, Michel Foucault, and others, have also been a considerable influence on the discipline in the late part of the 20th century and early 21st century. These theories emphasize the role of language variation, and the idea of subjective usage, depending on external elements like social and cultural factors, rather than merely on the interplay of formal elements. =Language documentation= Language documentation combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. Lexicography involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a dictionary. Computational linguistics is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of translation and interpretation, as well as in language education – the teaching of a second or foreign language. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research. Since the inception of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously undocumented languages. Starting with Franz Boas in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal linguistics in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly disappearing languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as sociolinguistics, anthropological linguistics, and linguistic anthropology, which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society. The emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a primary focus in many university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive endeavour, usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned, so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts and recordings, both sound and video, which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories, and used for further research.Himmelman, Nikolaus \\"Language documentation: What is it and what is it good for?\\" in P. Gippert, Jost, Nikolaus P Himmelmann & Ulrike Mosel. (2006) Essentials of Language documentation. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin & New York. =Translation= The sub-field of translation includes the translation of written and spoken texts across media, from digital to print and spoken. To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are often employed by organizations such as travel agencies and governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other's language. Translators are also employed to work within computational linguistics setups like Google Translate, which is an automated program to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences. Academic translators specialize in or are familiar with various other disciplines such as technology, science, law, economics, etc. =Clinical linguistics= Clinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the field of speech-language pathology. Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to treat communication and swallowing disorders. Chaika (1990) showed that people with schizophrenia who display speech disorders like rhyming inappropriately have attentional dysfunction, as when a patient was shown a color chip and then asked to identify it, responded \\"looks like clay. Sounds like gray. Take you for a roll in the hay. Heyday, May Day.\\" The color chip was actually clay-colored, so his first response was correct.' However, most people suppress or ignore words which rhyme with what they've said unless they are deliberately producing a pun, poem or rap. Even then, the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall meaning in discourse. People with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme and reason. Some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words.Chaika, Elaine Ostrach. 1990. Understanding Psychotic Speech: Between Freud and Chomsky. Chas. Thomas Publishers. =Computational linguistics= Computational linguistics is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is \\"computationally responsible\\", i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations. Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development. =Evolutionary linguistics= Evolutionary linguistics is the study of the emergence of the language faculty through human evolution, and also the application of evolutionary theory to the study of cultural evolution among different languages. It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe, through movements among ancient communities. Evolutionary linguistics is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces the natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which the fundamentals of language are understood. =Forensic linguistics= Forensic linguistics is the application of linguistic analysis to forensics. Forensic analysis investigates the style, language, lexical use, and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in courts of law. Forensic linguists have also used their expertise in the framework of criminal cases.

A native of Quebec, he worked for the Pacific Fur Company, the North West Company, and the Hudson’s Bay Company before he later became a farmer and ferry operator. In 1843 he participated in the Champoeg Meetings. Though he voted against the measure to form a provisional government, the measure passed and led to the creation of the Provisional Government of Oregon. Early life Jean Baptiste Eugene Laframboise was born on May 11, 1793, in Varennes, Quebec, Canada along the Saint Lawrence River.Mount Shasta Annotated Bibliography: Chapter 8 Early Exploration: American Trade & Migration, 1828-49. College of the Siskiyous Library. Retrieved on May 11, 2009. His parents were Michel Laframboise and Josephe Monjau, with Jean Baptiste adopting his father’s first name. He was hired by John Jacob Astor’s Pacific Fur Company in 1810 and sailed from New York City aboard the Tonquin.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1989. p. 139.

He had been hired as a voyageur, but with the sale of the post to the North West Company (NWC) he became an interpreter for that company in 1813. In 1821, the NWC was merged into the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) and he stayed on as an interpreter and as a postmaster in their Columbia District. During his employment with the HBC, Laframboise participated and often led many expeditions through the southern Oregon Country to Mexican-owned Alta California. He served as interpreter for Alexander Roderick McLeod in a party that visited the Umpqua River Valley and then California. Laframboise was on site to aid the establishment of Fort Umpqua along with McLeod. During successive years' expeditions he led often went to French Camp near modern Stockton, California. While working for the HBC out of Fort Vancouver, he received permission to settle some land on the French Prairie in 1831. However, Laframboise stayed with the company and helped restore the health of Hall J. Kelley when he arrived at the fort in 1834 with Ewing Young. Young’s party had been attacked on their way through Southern Oregon in the Rogue River Valley by the Rogue River Indians.Schwartz, E. A. 1997. The Rogue River Indian War and its Aftermath, 1850-1980. Norman, Okla: University of Oklahoma Press. p.21. These Native Americans were retaliating against whites after an expedition led by Laframboise killed eleven Natives earlier that year. This series of killings lasted for decades and eventually led to the Rogue River Wars in the 1850s. Meanwhile, Laframboise continued to lead expeditions south, occasionally independent of the HBC. French Prairie In 1839, he married Emile Picard, a Native American from the Umpqua region. The couple had several children before and after the marriage, settling on the French Prairie in the Willamette Valley of present-day Oregon around 1841. That year he also worked as Charles Wilkes' guide in the Oregon Country when Wilkes was leading the United States Exploring Expedition. Laframboise then built a home and barn on along the Willamette River just north of Champoeg. There he also had a mill and 200 horses. Laframboise took part in the Champoeg Meetings in 1843 where he voted against forming a settler government. However, the majority of settlers voted in favor and established the Provisional Government of Oregon.Corning, p. 206. By 1852 he had settled a Donation Land Claim north of his original property and was operating a ferry across the Willamette River to Champoeg, connecting to the Champoeg-Salem Road. He had a stroke in the early 1860s and then sold off his assets. Michel Laframboise died on January 25, 1865, at the age of 71. ReferencesFurther reading *Hafen, LeRoy R. 1893.

Career Sivkova discovered fencing at the age of 10 on the advice of a family friend, who knew a fencing coach. She took up the sport at SDUShOR (sports school) No.7 near the Borisov Ponds in Moscow, where she first practiced foil under the coaching of Lyudmila Vyazovaya. After a year Vyazovaya switched to épée; Sivkova followed the move. She was the only girl at her club, but she found that winning against boys motivated her. After two years of training she began to resent the hard discipline and left for a while; she came back when she realised she needed fencing to let off steam. Sivkova won the 1997 Cadet World Championships at Tenerife. Her silver medal in the 1998 World Youth Games made her realise she could become a champion. She then took a silver medal at the 1999 Junior World Championships at Keszthely and the gold at the 2000 Junior European Championships in Antalya. She joined the senior national team in 2001. Her first competition with Russia was the European Championships in Coblenz, where they took the silver medal. They went on to win the gold medal in the World Championships in Nîmes. She climbed in 2003 her first podium in the Fencing World Cup with a gold medal in Prague and two bronzes in Tauberbischofsheim and Havana. She also reached the quarter-finals in the World Championships in Havana. These results pushed her to 6th place in world rankings. The 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens were her first Olympic experience. In the individual event she was defeated in the first round by reigning Olympic Champion Tímea Nagy. In the team event, Russia overcame South Korea in the quarter-finals, then Canada. Sivkova's poor performance in her semi-final bouts prompted head coach Aleksandr Kislyunin to keep her as reserve in the final against Germany, which she took as a personal blow at the time. Russia eventually defeated Germany 34–28, allowing Sivkova to become Olympic team champion. The two following years were more difficult for Sivkova. As team épée was not included in the programme of the 2008 Summer Olympics, she had to enter the Top 8 to gain qualification, but her World Cup results were not good enough. After teammate Tatiana Logunova obtained her qualification, Sivkova had to get into the European Top 3 to go to Beijing. In the St Petersburg World Cup, the penultimate qualifying tournament, Sivkova was defeated by Romania's Ana Maria Brânză, who won the gold medal and one of the three European Olympic tickets. Coach Aleksandr Kislyunin decided Lyubov Shutova had better chances of getting qualified and chose not to send Sivkova to the last qualifying tournament in Florina. At the London Olympics, Sivkova defeated Jung Hyo-jung of Korea in the table of 32, but was stopped in the next round by Romania's Anca Măroiu. In the team event, Russia prevailed easily over Ukraine, then met China in the semi-finals. The match was very tight. Sivkova entered the piste on the last relay with China on the lead. She levelled the score, but lost by one touch in overtime and Russia came away with no medal. Deeply upset by these failures, Sivkova took a break and did not go back to training before January 2013.

The Society of Saint Pius X has been the subject of much controversy since 1988, when Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson and Alfonso de Galarreta were illicitly consecrated at the Ecône, Switzerland, International Seminary of Saint Pius X as bishops in violation of canon law. Lefebvre and the four other SSPX bishops individually incurred a disciplinary latae sententiae excommunication for the schismatic act; the excommunications of the four living SSPX bishops were remitted in 2009. Talks between the society and the Holy See are at an impasse, and the Holy See considers that the society has broken away from communion with the Catholic Church. Although the Holy See has granted to all priest members of the society the faculty to give sacramental absolution validly to those who attend its churches and has authorised local ordinaries to grant permission for celebrating marriages of followers of the society (see sections on faculties below), the Holy See has declared in a letter to the society dated 26 June 2017 and approved by Pope Francis on 20 May 2017 that full re-establishment of communion is conditional on its members making the 1998 profession of faith,Profession of faith made obligatory by Pope John Paul II by the motu proprio Ad tuendam fidem of 18 May 1988 accepting explicitly, with the degree of adhesion due to them, the teachings of the Second Vatican Council and subsequent church teachings, and recognising not only the validity but also the legitimacy of the rite of Mass and the other sacraments celebrated according to the liturgical books promulgated after that council.Medias-Presse-Infos (1 July 2017), \\"Le cardinal Müller, comme Benoît XVI en 2012, met un coup d’arrêt à un possible accord doctrinal avec la FSSPX\\". For an English translation, see Novus Ordo Watch, \\"'Cardinal' Müller throws Monkey Wrench into SSPX-Rome Reconciliation\\" The society, on the other hand, maintains that it was canonically established and has never been canonically suppressed, and that, in \\"the present crisis in the Church\\", when \\"heresy, and even apostasy, is widely spread amongst the clergy\\", \\"the Church mercifully supplies jurisdiction\\" for the good of the faithful. 1988 protocol In May 1988, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith signed a protocol intended to regularize the canonical status of the SSPX. Unofficial English translation of French original. The first part of the protocol was doctrinal in which Lefebvre agreed that the SSPX would: *promise fidelity to the Catholic Church and its pope *accept the doctrine of the magisterium found in Lumen gentium section 25 *pledge to avoid all polemics and to have a positive attitude of study and of communication with the Holy See *recognise the validity of the Mass and of the sacraments as promulgated by Popes Paul VI and John Paul II *promise to respect the common discipline of the church and her laws, including special provisions granted to the SSPX The second part of the protocol was juridical which negotiated rights and responsibilities of the SSPX as a group, and conditions of individuals affiliated with the SSPX that included that: *the existing SSPX would be canonically erected as a clerical society of apostolic life of pontifical right within the Latin Church with special provisions for public worship, care of souls, and other apostolic activity *the statutes of the canonical society of apostolic life would require approval by the pope to assure doctrinal compliance *either the local bishops or the Holy See would confer SSPX priests jurisdiction \\"with regard to the faithful\\" *the canonical society of apostolic life would be granted the right to celebrate Tridentine liturgical rites *lay SSPX adherents would \\"remain under the jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop\\" but could request sacraments administered by SSPX priests *a special seven member pontifical commission, which would include two SSPX members, would be established to coordinate relations with the Curia and diocesan bishops, to resolve problems and conflicts, and to \\"exercis vigilance and lending assistance to consolidate the work of reconciliation and to regulate questions relative to the religious communities having a juridical or moral bond with\\" the SSPX *a proposal to licitly consecrate an SSPX member as a bishop would be submitted to John Paul II *the Superior General of the society of apostolic life would send dimissorial letters to any bishop who agrees to ordain members of the society of apostolic life *an amnesty could be granted to illicit SSPX places of worship which were erected without the authorization of the local bishops *convalidation of existing invalid marriages celebrated by SSPX priests could be resolved by decree *regularization of existing illicit ordinations of SSPX priests could be resolved by decree Ratzinger and Lefebvre suggested in the protocol that: *the consecration of an SSPX member as bishop seems useful for \\"practical and psychological reasons\\" *on the doctrinal level, the superior general should not be the SSPX member who would consecrated as bishop but should be a member of the pontifical commission for stability The protocol was to be submitted to John Paul II for his approval. However, Lefebvre quickly developed misgivings and declared his intention to consecrate a bishop as his successor, even without a pontifical mandate. A meeting took place in Rome on 24 May. It is said that John Paul II promised to Lefebvre that he would appoint an SSPX member as a bishop, chosen according to the normal procedures, and that episcopal ordination would take place on 15 August. In return, Lefebvre would have to request reconciliation with the church on the basis of the protocol of 5 May. Lefebvre presented three requests: *the proposed episcopal ordination must take place on 30 June *not one, but three bishops, must be consecrated *a majority of members in the proposed pontifical commission must be SSPX members The Holy See's view Following the 1988 episcopal consecrations without a pontifical mandate, Pope John Paul II declared that the illicit consecrations were a schismatic act which \\"impli in practice the rejection of the Roman primacy\\" and that all six bishops involved in the ceremony had incurred automatic excommunication under the 1983 Code of Canon Law. John Paul II wrote, in Ecclesia Dei, that \\"the root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and contradictory notion of Tradition.\\" John Paul II reminded \\"that formal adherence to the schism is a grave offence against God\\" and schism is a delict against religion and the unity of the church with a penalty of excommunication. The individual excommunications of each of the SSPX bishops did not extend to the other SSPX members. =Ecclesia Dei commission= At the same time, John Paul II set up the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei (PCED) to help SSPX members and adherents who wished \\"to remain united to the Successor of Peter in the Catholic Church while preserving their spiritual and liturgical traditions\\" to enter \\"full ecclesial communion\\". The PCED issued many formal written clarifications about the canonical situation of people involved with the SSPX. =Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts= In 1996, the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts (PCILT) responded to an enquiry from Bishop Norbert Brunner, of the Diocese of Sion, Switzerland, that \\"in the case of the Lefebvrian deacons and priests there seems no doubt that their ministerial activity in the ambit of the schismatic movement is a more than evident sign of the fact that the two requirements\\" for formal adherence to the schism \\"have been met\\". The PCILT added: \\"On the other hand, in the case of the rest of the faithful it is obvious that an occasional participation in liturgical acts or the activity of the Lefebvrian movement, done without making one's own the attitude of doctrinal and disciplinary disunion of such a movement, does not suffice for one to be able to speak of formal adherence to the movement.\\" It stated that its judgment was about the existence of the sin of schism, since for the existence of the canonical crime of schism, which entails excommunication, the conditions listed in canons 1323–1324 of the Code of Canon Law must also be met. While its reply concerned only one diocese, the PCILT said that, if there was serious general pastoral confusion about the canonical situation of SSPX members, the Holy See could issue a general decree on the matter. The Holy See has not yet done so. =Likelihood of schism= In 1999, the PCED stated that it was likely, but not certain, that the SSPX members were adhering to a schism, which would mean that they were excommunicated, but that people who, \\"because of their attraction to the traditional Latin Mass and not because they refuse submission to the Roman Pontiff or reject communion with the members of the Church subject to him\\", attended Mass celebrated by SSPX priests, were not excommunicated, although, the longer they frequented SSPX chapels, the greater the likelihood of imbibing a schismatic mentality that would seem to involve adherence to the schism and so excommunication. The PCED judged that documentation sent to it in 1998 clearly indicated the extent to which \\"many in authority in\\" the SSPX conform with the formal definition of schism. =Moral impediment= In 1995, PCED explained that it \\"morally illicit for the faithful to participate in\\" SSPX Masses \\"unless they are physically or morally impeded from participating in a Mass celebrated by a Catholic priest in good standing\\" and added that not being able to assist at a Tridentine Mass \\"is not considered a sufficient motive for attending such Masses.\\" The PCED explained that although the ordinations of SSPX priests by SSPX bishops are valid, SSPX priests are prohibited from exercising a priestly function because SSPX priests are not incardinated into local diocese or religious institutes which are in full communion with the Catholic Church. The PCED also explained that the Masses celebrated by SSPX priests are valid but illicit, and that Penance and Matrimony by SSPX priests are invalid because SSPX priests lack conferred faculties. =Separation but not schism= Apart from the formal declarations by the Catholic Church, Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, president of the PCED, commented about the status of the SSPX in a 2005 interview that the 1988 consecrations, without a pontifical mandate, created a \\"situation of separation ... even if it was not a formal schism.\\" Castrillón Hoyos commented in 2005, about a 2004 meeting between Pope Benedict XVI and Fellay, that it was said at that meeting that, in Castrillón Hoyos words, \\"It cannot be said in correct, exact, and precise terms that there is a schism. ... They are within the Church. There is only the fact that a full, more perfect communion is lacking ... a fuller communion, because communion does exist.\\" Castrillón Hoyos commented in 2007, when asked \\"Does the Indult support ecumenism, 'ad intra' (internal)?\\" Castrillón Hoyos answered that he \\"reject the term ecumenism ad intra.\\" He explained that the SSPX priests and adherents \\"are not schismatics\\" since, =2009 declaration of no canonical status and no legitimate ministry= In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed that: \\"Until the doctrinal questions are clarified, the Society has no canonical status in the Church, and its ministers – even though they have been freed of the ecclesiastical penalty – do not legitimately exercise any ministry in the Church.\\" The status of the SSPX was not changed by Benedict in 2009. This has to some extent been superseded with regard to the exercise by SSPX ministers of ministry within the Catholic Church, but not as regards the canonical status of the society as viewed by the Holy See. On 20 November 2016, Pope Francis personally extended for priests of the society, until further provisions are made, the faculty by which \\"those faithful who, for various reasons, attend churches officiated by the priests of the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Pius X, can validly and licitly receive the sacramental absolution of their sins\\", a faculty he had already granted for the duration of the 2015–16 Jubilee Year. Confession, along with marriage, requires the granting of the required faculty for validity: \\"The valid absolution of sins requires that the minister have, in addition to the power of orders, the faculty of exercising it for the faithful to whom he imparts absolution\\" (Code of Canon Law 966.1). In a document from the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, published on 4 April 2017, local ordinaries are authorized to grant SSPX priests faculties to validly assist at marriages. For validity of marriage, marital consent must be declared \\"before the local ordinary, pastor, or a priest or deacon delegated by either of them\\" (Canon 1108). This priest, deacon or lay person (see can. 1112) is called the one who \\"assists\\" (is present). The one who assists is necessary in all cases except when one who is described as \\"competent to assist\\" cannot be found and either of these situations apply: \\"danger of death; [or] outside the danger of death provided that it is prudently foreseen that the situation will continue for a month\\". In that case, the parties may exchange consent before witnesses alone (Can. 1116.1). For any priest, other than the pastor (parish priest) or local ordinary of the parties, to be \\"competent to assist\\", he must receive the faculty from the parties' pastor or local ordinary. The 2017 letter from the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith specifically grants local ordinaries (not the pastors) permission, in some circumstances, to delegate SSPX priests to assist at the celebration of marriages of faithful who follow the pastoral activity of the society. Insofar as possible, the local ordinary is to delegate a priest of his diocese (or at least \\"a fully regular priest\\") to receive the consent of the parties during the marriage rite, which is then followed by Mass celebrated perhaps by a priest of the society. If this is not possible and \\"if there are no priests in the Diocese able to receive the consent of the parties, the Ordinary may grant the necessary faculties to the priest of the Society who is also to celebrate the Holy Mass\\". =The Holy See and sanctions at the diocesan level= In 1991 Bishop Joseph Ferrario, of the diocese of Honolulu, declared that six adherents of the SSPX movement were excommunicated for, among other things, procuring the services of SSPX Bishop Richard Williamson to illicitly administer confirmation. They sought hierarchical recourse from the Holy See to reverse the decree. The Holy See found in a review of the case that the submitted facts of the case were not formal schismatic acts so the decree lacked foundation under the cited canons and was therefore invalid; Ferrario should have, instead, imposed penalties under canon 1373. In 1996, one of the earliest proponents of the Tridentine Mass, Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz, of the diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska, issued a warning that Catholics within the diocese who are members of the SSPX incur excommunication. In 2014, Bishop Marcello Semeraro, of the diocese of Albano, Italy, issued a warning that Catholics within that diocese would incur excommunication for attending SSPX Masses or receiving sacraments from SSPX priests \\"because the society has no canonical status.\\" The society's viewExtraordinary jurisdiction= The SSPX considers itself faithful to the Catholic Church and to the popes, up to and including Pope Francis. The SSPX bishops do not claim ordinary jurisdiction over SSPX adherents, which would make the latter subject to them, not to the local diocesan bishops,Cf. Code of Canon Law, canon 107 and canon 65 and would amount to an obvious challenge to the Holy See's authority and an act of schism. Instead the SSPX claims to possess extraordinary jurisdiction. This is of specific importance in Catholic canon law in relation to the sacraments of confession and marriage. =Absolution of sins and assistance at marriage= To absolve sins validly, a priest must be given the faculty to do so,Code of Canon Law, canon 966 a faculty that, normally, only the local bishop can give.Code of Canon Law, canon 969 Similarly, in normal circumstances a marriage can be contracted validly only in the presence of the local bishop or the parish priest or of a priest or deacon delegated by one of these.Code of Canon Law, canon 1108 To overcome this difficulty, the SSPX argues that absolution and marriage under its auspices are valid, because of its interpretation of canon law. For example, canon 144 §1 states, \\"In common error, whether of fact or of law, and in positive and probable doubt, whether of law or of fact, the Church supplies executive power of governance for both the external and the internal forum.\\"canon 144 §1 Canon 1335 states, The SSPX also argues that if one believes they are outside of the church, This opinion has been argued for a recipient who bound to believe that canon 844 §2 applies, which declares that, The website advancedchristianity.com published a tract to support the SSPX opinion, the tract claims that in 1989 Cardinal Paul Augustin Mayer confirmed this in a letter that the \\"principle of 'common error', whether on the part of only one faithful or on the part of the community, can be applied in this case, and such acts are thereby valid\\" The Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei explained that the sacraments of Penance and Matrimony are invalid because SSPX priests are not granted faculty to administer those sacraments, but that the principle of common error applies to the sacrament of Penance, so if a recipient is genuinely ignorant that the priest in question lacks the faculty to absolve. Such private letters to individuals do not have the force of law for the faithful in general. However, \\"statements of dicasteries and organisms of the Holy See which touch on faith and morals are not considered infallible, but should be taken as norms of moral certitude.\\" In a letter dated 23 May 2008, the PCED stated: =Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy confessions= During the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, which starts in December 2015 and lasts for a year, Pope Francis established that those people who approach SSPX priests to hear their confession during the jubilee \\"shall validly and licitly receive the absolution of their sins.\\" The Pope also granted all priests \\"the discretion to absolve\\" from the sin of abortion (which usually must be absolved either by the bishop, or by priests authorized to do so by him – there are usually, but certainly not always, many of those made available). The SSPX priests only have the faculty of being able to absolve sins during that Jubilee Year; outside of that time frame they do not have it, and they are still to be considered by Catholics who follow the Vatican to be suspended from all ministries except absolution. In November 2016 in Misericordia et misera, Francis announced that he had \\"personally decided to extend this faculty beyond the Jubilee Year, until further provisions are made, lest anyone ever be deprived of the sacramental sign of reconciliation through the Church's pardon.\\"https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_letters/documents/papa- francesco-lettera-ap_20161120_misericordia-et-misera.html s. 12 =Marriage impediments= The SSPX provides, for the faithful who request it, a review of marriage annulment decrees emanated from diocesan tribunals, since in its view many tribunals have been granting them without sufficient grounds to do so; in this manner, the faithful can acquire a greater degree of moral certitude when an annulment is doubtful. Critics have interpreted this service as a usurping of the authority to dispense from marriage impediments and to declare marriage annulments, which belongs to the ordinary jurisdiction of diocesan bishops, and which would be schismatic in kind. This has led some priests to leave the SSPX. Canonical censures on membersThe Holy See lifts excommunication of bishops= Lefebvre died in 1991 as an excommunicated person. In their 2008 petition, the four surviving SSPX bishops \\"acknowledged the supreme authority of the Holy Father, and noted that 'the current situation causes us much suffering'.\\" In 2009, the Congregation for Bishops remitted the excommunication of the four surviving SSPX bishops. \\"By definition, their request carried with it an acknowledgement of the Pope's authority over the Church here on earth.\\" Pope Benedict XVI explained that the SSPX has no canonical status in the Catholic Church for doctrinal reasons and that SSPX ministers \\"do not legitimately exercise any ministry in the Church.\\" =Suspension a divinis= Although the 1988 excommunication of the four SSPX bishops was remitted in 2009, the SSPX bishops and priests were still unable to exercise any episcopal or priestly ministry in the Catholic Church. According to canon 1383 of the Code of Canon Law, a suspension a divinis affects SSPX clergy who have been ordained to the priesthood illegitimately.

He played as a centre forward. Playing career Houghton was born in Madras to an Anglo-Indian family who emigrated to England in 1947 when India gained independence from British rule. He joined Bradford Park Avenue as an amateur in 1954, and turned professional the following year. In 1957 First Division club Birmingham City paid £5,250 for his services, but he rarely appeared; a burly man, his bustling style did not answer Birmingham's need for a more mobile centre forward. A year later he moved on to Southend United, where he had more playing time. In two-and-a-half years he played 73 games in all competitions and scored 33 goals, and was leading scorer in the 1958–59 season with 20 goals. Arthur Turner, who had signed Houghton for Birmingham and was then managing Oxford United, paid £2,000 for his services in March 1961. In what remained of the 1960–61 season, Houghton scored 13 goals, including 5 in a 7–2 defeat of Boston United, as Oxford won the championship of the Southern League. He continued in prolific vein: the 1961–62 season brought 39 goals from 39 league games, and 43 from 42 games in all competitions, as Oxford won the Southern League title for the second year running and were elected to the Football League for the first time. Houghton was unable to maintain that rate of scoring in the Football League, though he finished leading scorer for the second consecutive season, with 16 league goals, and scored in Oxford's first ever game in the Football League, on the opening day of the 1962–63 season against Barrow. In October 1963, Houghton joined fellow Fourth Division side Lincoln City for a fee of £6,000. He was made captain, but after a poor start to the 1964–65 season, Lincoln's directors took over team selection duties from manager Bill Anderson and relieved Houghton of the captaincy in favour of Brian Jackson. He scored 25 goals in 61 games in all competitions during an 18-month stay, and then returned to the Southern League with successively Chelmsford City, Cambridge United, Wellington Town and Cheltenham Town.

The proteins in the pili are then broken down to shrink the pili pulling the cell closer to the surface or object that was it was attached to. b) Specific Motility Membrane Proteins: Transmembrane proteins are attached to the host surface. This adhesion complex can either be specific to a certain type of surface like a certain cell type or generic for any solid surface. Motor proteins attached to an inner membrane force the movement of the internal cell structures in relation to the transmembrane proteins creating net movement. This is driven by the proton motive force. The proteins involved differ between species. An example of a bacterium that uses this mechanism would be Flavobacterium. This mechanism is still being studied and is not well understood. c) Polysaccharide Jet: The cell releases a 'jet' of polysaccharide material behind it propelling it forward. This polysaccharide material is left behind. Gliding motility is a type of translocation used by microorganisms that is independent of propulsive structures such as flagella, pili, and fimbriae. Gliding allows microorganisms to travel along the surface of low aqueous films. The mechanisms of this motility are only partially known. Twitching motility also allows microorganisms to travel along a surface, but this type of movement is jerky and uses pili as its means of transport. Bacterial gliding is a type of gliding motility that can also use pili for propulsion. The speed of gliding varies between organisms, and the reversal of direction is seemingly regulated by some sort of internal clock. For example the apicomplexans are able to travel at fast rates between 1–10 μm/s. In contrast Myxococcus xanthus bacteria glide at a rate of 5 μm/min. Cell- invasion and gliding motility have TRAP (thrombospondin-related anonymous protein), a surface protein, as a common molecular basis that is both essential for infection and locomotion of the invasive apicomplexan parasite. Micronemes are secretory organelles on the apical surface of the apicomplexans used for gliding motility. Types of motility Bacterial gliding is a process of motility whereby a bacterium can move under its own power. Generally, the process occurs whereby the bacterium moves along a surface in the general direction of its long axis. Gliding may occur via distinctly different mechanisms, depending on the type of bacterium. This type of movement has been observed in phylogenetically diverse bacteria such as cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, cytophaga, flavobacteria, and mycoplasma. Bacteria move in response to varying climates, water content, presence of other organisms, and firmness of surfaces or media. Gliding has been observed in a wide variety of phyla, and though the mechanisms may vary between bacteria, it is currently understood that it takes place in environments with common characteristics, such as firmness and low-water, which enables the bacterium to still have motility in its surroundings. Such environments with low-water content include biofilms, soil or soil crumbs in tilth, and microbial mats. =Purpose= Gliding, as a form of motility, appears to allow for interactions between bacteria, pathogenesis, and increased social behaviours. It may play an important role in biofilm formation, bacterial virulence, and chemosensing. =Swarming motility= Swarming motility occurs on softer semi-solid and solid surfaces (which usually involves movement of a bacterial population in a coordinated fashion via quorum sensing, using flagella to propel them), or twitching motility on solid surfaces (which involves extension and retraction of type IV pili to drag the bacterium forward). Proposed mechanisms The mechanism of gliding might differ between species. Examples of such mechanisms include: *Motor proteins found within the inner membrane of the bacteria utilize a proton-conducting channel to transduce a mechanical force to the cell surface. The movement of the cytoskeletal filaments causes a mechanical force which travels to the adhesion complexes on the substrate to move the cell forward. Motor and regulatory proteins that convert intracellular motion into mechanical forces like traction force have been discovered to be a conserved class of intracellular motors in bacteria that have been adapted to produce cell motility. *A-motility (adventurous motility) as a proposed type of gliding motility, involving transient adhesion complexes fixed to the substrate while the organism moves forward. For example, in Myxococcus xanthus, a social bacterium. *Ejection or secretion of a polysaccharide slime from nozzles at either end of the cell body. *Energized nano-machinery or large macromolecular assemblies located on the bacterium's cell body. *\\"Focal adhesion complexes\\" and \\"treadmilling\\" of surface adhesins distributed along the cell body. *The gliding motility of Flavobacterium johnsoniae uses a helical track superficially similar to M. xanthus, but via a different mechanism. Here the adhesin SprB is propelled along the cell surface (spiraling from pole to pole), pulling the bacterium along 25 times faster than M. xanthus. Flavobacterium johnsoniae move via a screw-like mechanism and are powered by a proton motive force.

It was gutted by fire in 1878 and restored over the next two years. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. Before the Norman Conquest the Christian community at Huntspill was given by Offa of Mercia to Glastonbury Abbey. In the 13th century it was given to Tickford Priory at Newport Pagnell until it was taken under the control of the Bishop of Wells. Since the 18th century the patronage has been held by Balliol College, Oxford. The church's original dedication was to All Saints which changed to St Peter around 1872 and then in the 1950s the dedication to St Peter and All Hallows was adopted. The church has a five bay nave and chancel and four stage west tower. The tower holds six beels which date from 1879 when they replaced the previous five the oldest of which was cast in 1693. The church underwent extensive Victorian restoration between 1878 and 1880, following a major fire, which gutted the interior and roof leaving only the stonework still standing. Refurbishment work to glass the lady chapel and the north door during 2011 was delayed when the company carrying out the work went into receivership. The parish is part of the Huntspill and East Huntspill benefice within the Axbridge deanery.

He was a SuperPrep and USA Today All-American and earned an invitation to play in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Sturdivant ranked 14th among offensive guard prospects in the nation. College career As a true freshman in 2007, Sturdivant started all 13 games at left tackle for the Georgia Bulldogs. He became the first true freshman to start at that position in a season opener since Mike Fellows in 1989. He subsequently earned Freshman All-American First team honors by Scout.com and Rivals.com. He missed the 2008 season after undergoing reconstructive surgery on injured left knee. He tore his anterior cruciate ligament in a preseason scrimmage. He played in the 2009 season opening game against Oklahoma State where he reinjured his left knee. Sturdivant sat the rest of the season out from the injury.. Sturdivant is perhaps best known for his infamous celebration during the 2007 Florida- Georgia football game, where he was shown dancing in front of Florida players after the entire Georgia team stormed the field after their first touchdown of the game.

This area is most likely involved in eye movement, as electrical stimulation evokes saccades (quick movements) of the eyes. It is also thought to contribute to working memory associated with guiding eye movement, examined using a delayed saccade task described below:Gnadt, J. W., & Andersen, R. A. (1988). Memory related motor planning activity in posterior parietal cortex of macaque. Experimental Brain Research, 70(1), 216-220.Pesaran, B., Pezaris, J. S., Sahani, M., Mitra, P. P., & Andersen, R. A. (2002). Temporal structure in neuronal activity during working memory in macaque parietal cortex. Nature neuroscience, 5(8), 805-811. #A subject focuses on a fixation point at the center of a computer screen. #A target (for instance a shape) is presented at a peripheral location on the screen. #The target is removed and followed by a variable-length delay period. #The initial focus point in the middle of the screen is removed. #The subject's task is to make a saccade to the location of the target. Neurons in area LIP have been shown to start responding with the initial presentation of the stimulus. The neurons keep responding through the delay period until the saccadic eye movement starts and the animal soon focuses on the exact location of the previously shown target. There is also evidence for neurons firing for saccadic responses in the two-alternative forced choice task. The conclusion of this task experiment is that neurons in area LIP store information (the location of the target) useful for guiding the saccadic movement; that is, this area of the cortex shows modality-specific working memory. Areas showing specificity for other modalities have been located.

He is best known for his critical role in the development of the lithium-ion battery, as the inventor of the graphite anode (negative pole) of lithium-ion batteries. He is also known for his research on fluoride ion batteries. Education Yazami is a 1978 graduate of the Grenoble Institute of Technology, (INPG) where he also received a Ph. D. degree in 1985. Battery research Rachid Yazami in the battery lab at Caltech Yazami's research project included a study of graphite intercalation compounds for lithium battery applications. In 1985 he joined the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) as Research Associate. He was later promoted to Research Director (Professor) position in 1998. In 1980 Yazami was the first scientist to establish the reversible intercalation of lithium into graphite in an electrochemical cell using a polymer electrolyte. Eventually, his discovery led to the lithium-graphite anode now used in commercial lithium ion batteries, an over US$80B value market. Yazami also worked on other forms of graphite materials for cathode application in lithium batteries, including graphite oxide and graphite fluoride. In 2007 he founded a start-up company in California to develop and commercialize his patented discoveries particularly on fluoride ion batteries (FIBs). While holding a Research Director position with the CNRS in France, Yazami has served as a Visiting Associate at the California Institute of Technology between 2000 and 2010 where he conducted cooperative research on electrode materials including nanostructured materials such as carbon nanotubes, nano-silicon and nano-germanium anodes. His research on cathode materials included thermodynamics studies of phase transitions in lithiated transition metal oxides and phosphates. He also developed a new electrochemical technique based on thermodynamics measurements (ETM), which applies to assess a battery state of charge, state of health and state of safety. Entropymetry applications include battery life extension owing to adaptive (smart) battery charging protocols and battery safety enhancement. In 2010 Yazami was appointed a Nanyang Visiting Professor then he was promoted in 2012 the Cheng Tsang Man Chair Professor in Energy at the School of Materials Science and Engineering of the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. He currently serves as the Director of Battery Programs at the Energy Research Institute (ERIAN) and as a Co-Principal Investigator in TUM Create Center of Electromobility lab. in Singapore. Yazami co-authored over 200 publications in peer-reviewed journals, in proceedings of international meetings and as book chapters. He is the inventor involved in close to 150 patents according to the WIPO site. In 2011 Yazami founded a new start-up company in Singapore, KVI,PTE LTD, which develops and commercialises novel equipments and components to investigate novel battery materials and batteries for enhanced energy, power and cycle life performances and also to increase their safety. The KVI technology is based on thermodynamics principles and methods. KVI has exclusive license on the ETM technology, including an imbedded chip for state of charge, state of health and state of safety assessment and an adaptive (ultra-fast) charging protocole. Recently, Prof. Yazami demonstrated a new battery cell based on three electrodes, an anode, a cathode and an auxiliary electrode used to regenerate the cell after aging. From recent experimental work Yazami theorized that in a sealed rechargeable battery cell (closed system), such as a lithium ion battery, two different states of charge of the battery cannot have simultaneously the same entropy and the same enthalpy values,a statement referred to as the 'Yazami's Battery Theorem'. The theorem can be expressed as: (∆S(x1)=∆S(x2)) and (∆H(x1)=∆H(x2))⇔ x1=x2 , where x1, x2 are two states of charge, ∆S= entropy, ∆H= enthalpy In fact, Yazami established a more universal (empirical) law which applies to primary and rechargeable batteries, that is the state of charge is a linear function of entropy and enthalpy. SOC=α+β∆S+γ∆H, in which α, β and γ coefficients depend on the cell' chemistry and state of health. Awards and writing Yazami is the co-author involved in over 250 published papers and the co-inventor of over 150 patents related to lithium primary and rechargeable batteries and on new battery chemistry based on fluoride ion. He served as the President of the International Battery Association (IBA) and as a Member of International Scientific Advisory Board of several international meetings, including the International Meetings on Lithium Batteries (IMLB). Yazami is the recipient of several research awards, including with NATO (Science for Peace Award), NASA (two Technical Innovation Awards), IBA (Research Award) and the Hawaii Battery Conference. He is the main Founder of CFX Battery, Inc. (now Contour Energy Systems, Inc.) a Caltech-CNRS start up company in Azusa, California and of KVI PTE LTD in Singapore. Yazami is the winner of 2012 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE Medal for Environmental and Safety Technologies.http://www.ieee.org/about/awards/medals/envsaf.html In 2014, Rachid Yazami, John Goodenough, Yoshio Nishi and Akira Yoshino were awarded the Draper Prize by The National Academy of Engineering for pioneering and leading the groundwork for today’s lithium ion battery.

However, Yazami himself was omitted from the award, which was instead given to Stanley Whittingham, John Goodenough and Akira Yoshino. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Goodenough and Whittigham for their cathodes, and Yoshino for the first working prototype, but omitted the importance of the working graphite anode invented by Yazami. Due to the Nobel Prize's limitation of up to three recipients, Yazami believes the committee had to make \\"a very hard decision\\" between Whittingham and himself. He nevertheless congratulated the three recipients of the prize.

Formed in 1961 at Uzhhorod in Ukraine as the 919th Separae Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment, it was equipped with the S-75. In 1968, the regiment was included in the Central Group of Forces (Czechoslovakia) and relocated to the town of Kurzhivody (Kuřivody) next to the city of Mimoni (Mimoň). In the early 1970s the brigade reequipped with the 2K11 Krug (SA-4 'Ganef'). In 1989, the brigade was reequipped with the Buk M1 (SA-11 'Gadfly'), and in June 1990, was relocated to Shuya. The brigade was relocated to Lomonosov and Nenimyaki in 2009, and Gorelovo in 2012.  History  Cold War = As a result of an expansion of the Soviet air defence troops, the 919th Separate Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment was formed in Uzhorod between 20 September and 20 November 1961 as part of the 38th Army. The 919th was equipped with the S-75 Dvina surface-to-air missile (SAM) and was commanded by Colonel Ivan Antonovich Guly. Between June 1962 and April 1965 the regiment was stationed at Svaliava. In August 1968, attached to the 28th Army Corps, the brigade participated in Operation Danube, the suppression of the Prague Spring. After the end of the invasion, the 919th stayed in Czechoslovakia at Chervona Vody, as part of the Central Group of Forces. In 1971, the regiment was equipped with the new 2K11 Krug SAM and converted into the 5th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade. It was moved to Kurivody (now in Ralsko) at the same time and became part of the 28th Army Corps. The 350th Separate Anti-Aircraft Rocket Battalion was based at Plzeň, the 1096th at Chervona Vody, and the 1097th at Kurivody. In 1989 the brigade was reequipped with the new Buk missile system, and added a new battalion, the 1095th at Kurivody. In June 1990, as part of the withdrawal of the Central Group of Forces from Czechoslovakia, the 5th Brigade was relocated to Shuya, Ivanovo Oblast, and became part of the 22nd Army. = Service in the Russian Ground Forces = In 1992, the brigade participated in the \\"Oborona-92\\" air defence exercises and research tests at Embi, Kazakhstan. From 1993 to 1999, the 5th Brigade was part of the CIS (mainly Russian) peacekeeping force in Abkhazia, providing air defense for the Russian base at Gudauta. In 1995, the brigade participated in the \\"Phoenix-95\\" demonstration exercise at Embi, which resulted in foreign countries making contracts to acquire SAMs. In 2006 and 2008, the brigade conducted live fire tactical exercises at Kapustin Yar. In 2008, the 5th Brigade was recognized as the best SAM brigade in the 22nd Army and the Moscow Military District. On 18 November 2009, it was relocated to Lomonosov and Nenimyaki near St. Petersburg, becoming part of the 6th Army. On 24 February 2012, the brigade was transferred to Gorelovo in St. Petersburg.

He succeeded S. Y. Quraishi as the Chief Election Commissioner on 11 June 2012. Born on 16 January 1950, Sampath retired on 15 January 2015 when he attained 65 years of age. Early career In his early career in the state of Andhra Pradesh in the southern part of India, Shri Sampath was the administrative head (District Collector) of large Indian districts between 1975 and 1986. This stint, apart from giving him a strong grounding in public administration and policy implementation, also provided a good exposure to election organization at the grass root level. As the District Collector of several coastal districts, Shri Sampath led large teams in managing natural disasters and cyclone relief in rural areas, an experience that required execution abilities under extreme pressure and timelines. Subsequently, Shri V S Sampath also led several state owned financial institutions and federations such as the Apex Co-operative Bank, Handloom Marketing Society, and Oil Seeds Federation in Food and Public Distribution Department, Industries Department and Finance Department between 1986 and 1989. This provided a strong footing in managing organizations and working towards realization of organizational goals in compressed timeframes. He will serve as CEC until he reaches the retirement age of 65 on 16 January 2015. Middle career Subsequently, between 1990 and 2004, Shri Sampath moved to the upper echelons of the state administration, wherein he held several challenging portfolios like Secretary in Agriculture Department and Principal Secretary in Energy Department. His period as Principal Secretary Energy ushered in the first instance of large- scale power sector reforms in a large state like Andhra Pradesh, and enabling the opening up of the sector for the private sector investment in power sector. The work of the Energy department and the state administration in reforming the power sector has been internationally appreciated, and has demonstrated how effective governance and reforms could reduce AT&C; losses and improve distribution efficiencies. Subsequently, Shri Sampath then served as Principal Secretary, Finance wherein he handled the state finances of Andhra Pradesh, a state with an annual budget of over Rs. 51,000 crores (or $8 billion) and a population of over 80 million. Recent Years In the past few years Shri Sampath held several important postings in Central Government. Starting with a stint in the Union Ministry of Rural Development. In 2005, Shri Sampath was appointed as Director General, National Institute of Rural Development. Subsequently, he held the post of Secretary, Chemicals and Petrochemicals where he was pivotal in conceptualizing and implementing the PCPIR policy to help the growth of the Petrochemical sector in India by facilitating massive investments in the identified Regions. Later, he also served as Secretary, in the Central Power Ministry, where he was instrumental in implementing several forward-thinking policies to aid the sector. Among them was Restructured-Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme (R-APDRP), a mega-package for the renovation and modernization of Indian power utilities to help them improve their performance.Election Commission  As CEC  To his credit, as Chief Election commissioner, Sampath has smoothly conducted the largest electoral exercise in the history of world democracies - 2014 Indian general election-the 14th general elections in India, where 550 million voters out 814 million eligible voters participated and the highest voting percentage was recorded since Indian independence-66.7%. This election was applauded as the largest electoral exercise in the world, and drew international praise. Discovery Channel also did a special show called The World's Biggest Election.\\"Revealed: The World's Biggest Election\\" Sampath has brought with him to the office of CEC, a style of quiet efficiency, effective planning and time-bound execution. An outstanding example of his brand of election management is the recently conducted Jharkhand and Jammu & Kashmir elections. Both these elections were conducted in adverse circumstances - Jharkhand on the back of Maoist violence, and J&K; on the back of floods and perennial terrorism issues. However, the election was executed to clockwork precision, and this achievement was noted by all as being one of the smoothest elections in these two states. As is typical of Sampath's style, the Election Commission has conducted these elections with least amount of media interaction and hype. Leaders of major political parties in J&K; also complimented the free & fair election process.  Electoral innovations as CEC  As Chief Election Commissioner, Sampath pioneered several reforms in poll management, the primary among them being : *Expenditure monitoring. *Flying squads and surveillance teams were set up to monitor election expenditure of candidates during the election. This exercise was maximised during the General Elections 2014, where over 21000 flying squads were deployed] to monitor candidate expenditure. These teams enabled seizures of cash of Rs 313 crore, 2.2 lakh litres of liquor valued at Rs 1,000 crore and 1.85 lakh kg of drugs. The Commission also deployed a \\"standard operating procedure for flying squads and static surveillance teams\\" that was quite effective in checking usage of cash in elections. *Sampath played a role in introduction of Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) in eight Lok Sabha constituencies in Indian General Elections.8 seats having VVPAT facility Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) system was first used with EVMs in a by-poll in September 2013 in Noksen (Assembly Constituency) in Nagaland. VVPAT was used in gradual manner in all elections starting from September 2013- 2013 Mizoram Legislative Assembly election, 2013 Delhi Legislative Assembly election, 2013 Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, 2013 Rajasthan Legislative Assembly election, 2013 Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly election, 2014 Indian general election, 2014 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election, 2014 Haryana Legislative Assembly election, 2014 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 2014 Jharkhand Legislative Assembly election *NOTA was also an option on Indian voting machines during his tenure. *Sampath also introduced the Systematic Voter Awareness and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) Program to increase participation of voters in elections. This move has borne exceptional results with every election in his tenure recording higher turnouts than before, and the 2014 General Election recording the highest turnout since Indian Independence. * Under Sampath's tenure, the Election Commission has also taken many steps to make voting convenient and comfortable for voters. The Election Commission devised Model Voting Stations, a polling station with all basic amenities and essential requirements to make voting an enjoyable experience. *V. S. Sampath also emphasized voting rights for NRIs through proxy voting.Later Supreme Court of India awarded voting rights to NRIs onb 12 January 2015.  Invocation of Article 324 of the Constitution of India  The Article 324 of the Indian Constitution is the basic article for the Election Commission that provides for powers to ensure free and fair elections in India. However, in comparison to earlier Election Commissions, Sampath was the first to invoke the powers under Article 324 to take strong disciplinary actions in the sphere of free and fair elections. As an unprecedented move, Sampath banned several campaigners from the General Elections 2014 for hate speeches during the campaign time. This put a check to polarizing speeches by political parties in the run up to the General Elections, and all subsequent elections. Further, in comparison to earlier Election Commissioners who were content with making recommendations to amend the law with regarding to Election Expenditure, Sampath was the first CEC who invoked the power of Article 324 to issue transparency guidelines. This move sparked several protests by political parties, who cited lack of jurisdiction on part of the Election Commission to issue such orders. However, in another unprecedented step, the Election Commission issued a clarification that such guidelines are binding, and any non-compliance would result in invocation of the draconian Para 16A of the Symbols Order 1968. Para 16A allows for the Election Commission to de-recognize a political party, a step that would deny the party of free airtime on state owned channels / radio, lack of access to free electoral rolls and non-availability of subsidized land for party offices. This greatly gives teeth to the Election Commission in managing election expenditure.  Personal life  VS Sampath is considered low-profile and efficient in execution of the job at hand. He is variously described as god- fearing, media-shy and self-effacing. Famously, as CEC during the General Elections 2014 (when the nation's administration was under his control), he went to the famous Tirupati temple and had a laghu darshan from a distance like any ordinary citizen, setting an example for functionaries in high office. Sampath lives in Delhi with his wife, and has two children, a son and a daughter.  Disqualification in the Ashok Chavan case  In the landmark judgement in the Ashok Chavan case in the case of inaccurate electoral rolls in the 2009 election, the Election Commission held - \\"Para 94 - Having regard to the totality of the circumstances mentioned above relating to the publication of the aforesaid 25 advertisements in various newspapers referred to above, the Commission is of the considered view that respondent cannot validly claim ignorance about the publication of the abovementioned 25 advertisements in which his name, the name of his constituency and also his photograph prominently appeared. \\" Thus Ashok Chavan was issued a show-cause notice for disqualification in the above case. This sets a bench-mark for accurate election reporting, and the Election Commission, under Sampath, for the first time, took the pathbreaking decision of moving towards disqualification of a politician for inaccurate reporting of poll expenses. The matter is now in appeal in the Delhi high Court.  Expenditure reform  Sampath is noted to be the first CEC to have taken far-reaching steps in expenditure management. Among these steps include static surveillance squads to monitor election expenditure of candidates, organizing expenditure observers during elections and maintaining shadow accounts for candidates. Importantly, Sampath issued the \\"Transparency guidelines\\" for political parties, thereby making it mandatory for them to file semi-annual returns of their balance sheets & and income statements. These steps go a long way towards ensuring free and fair elections in India. Views on electoral reforms V. S. Sampath believes that the Election Commission should be given greater autonomy and more power for its effective functioning. He advocates for a strong law to curb the practice of paid news. He has suggested the Parliament to take up right to reject. Advocating such a move, he said, \\"Right to reject is an idea inherent to democracy, whose time for execution has come\\".

The phrase has subsequently also been applied to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 (which began World War I) as well as other events.  Skirmish at the North Bridge  The opening stanza of \\"Concord Hymn\\" is inscribed at the base of The Minute Man statue by Daniel Chester French, located at the North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts. The phrase comes from the opening stanza of Ralph Waldo Emerson's \\"Concord Hymn\\" (1837) and refers to the first shot of the American Revolution at the Old North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts, where the first British soldiers fell in the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Historically, no single shot can be cited as the first shot of the battle or the war. Shots were fired earlier that day at Lexington, Massachusetts, where eight Americans were killed and a British soldier was slightly wounded, but accounts of that event are confused and contradictory. The North Bridge skirmish did see the first shots by Americans acting under orders, the first organized volley by Americans, the first British fatalities, and the first British retreat. The towns of Lexington and Concord have debated over the point of origin for the Revolutionary War since 1824, when the Marquis de Lafayette visited the towns. He was welcomed to Lexington hearing it described as the \\"birthplace of American liberty\\", but he was then informed in Concord that the \\"first forcible resistance\\" was made there. President Ulysses S. Grant considered not attending the 1875 centennial celebrations in the area to evade the issue. In 1894, Lexington petitioned the state legislature to proclaim April 19 as \\"Lexington Day\\", to which Concord objected; the current name for the holiday is Patriots' Day. Emerson lived in a house known as the Old Manse at the time when he was composing the \\"Concord Hymn\\", from which his grandfather and father (then a young child) had witnessed the skirmish. The house is located approximately from the North Bridge.  Assassination of Franz Ferdinand  The phrase \\"shot heard round the world\\" (alternatively \\"shots heard round the world\\" or \\"shot heard around the world\\") has also become associated with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, an event considered to be one of the immediate causes of World War I. Serbian Gavrilo Princip fired two shots, the first hitting Franz Ferdinand's wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, and the second hitting the Archduke himself. The death of Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, propelled Austria-Hungary and the rest of Europe into World War I.  Widespread idiomatic use  The phrase \\"Shot heard round the world\\" continues to be a stock phrase in the 21st century, widely used to refer to extraordinary events in general. The phrase has been applied to several dramatic moments in sports history. In baseball, the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" refers to the game-winning walk-off home run by New York Giants outfielder Bobby Thomson off Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca to win the National League pennant on October 3, 1951. The Giants won the game 5–4 as a result of the home run, defeating their traditional rivals in the pennant playoff series, although they eventually lost the World Series to the Yankees. In association football, the shot heard round the world refers to Paul Caligiuri's winning goal for the United States men's national soccer team in the final qualifying round for the 1990 FIFA World Cup on 19 November 1989.\\" 'The shot' ends 40 years of hurt\\", FIFA.com, September 10, 2015 The US had not qualified for the World Cup since 1950. The team was in third position of the CONCACAF playoffs before their final game against Trinidad and Tobago in Port of Spain. The US had to win to go to the finals, their opponents only needed a draw. Defensive midfielder Caliguri, the only full-professional player in the team, received the ball 40 yards out from goal, and instead of passing it to a striker, beat one defender and launched a 30-yard shot that looped into goal. In golf, the shot heard round the world refers to a double eagle (or albatross) made by Gene Sarazen on the 15th hole in the final round of the 1935 Masters. Sarazen would go on to win the tournament in a 36-hole playoff.

Typically, n lies between 10 and 16, although generally supplied as a tighter cut, such as C12-C15, C12-C13 and C10-C13, for detergent use. The CnH2n+1 chain is unbranched. They are mainly produced as intermediate in the production of surfactants, for use in detergent. Since the 1960s, LABs have emerged as the dominant precursor of biodegradable detergents. Production Hydrotreated kerosene is a typical feedstock for high purity linear paraffins (n-paraffins), which are subsequently dehydrogenated to linear olefins: :CnH2n+2 → CnH2n \\\\+ H2 Alternatively, ethylene can be oligomerized (partially polymerized) to produce linear alkenes. The resulting linear mono-olefins react with benzene in the presence of a catalyst to produce the LABs. Hydrogen fluoride (HF) and aluminium chloride (AlCl3) are the two major catalysts for the alkylation of benzene with linear mono-olefins. The HF-based process is commercially dominant; however, the risk of releasing HF (a poisonous substance) into the environment became a concern particularly after the Clean Air Act Amendment. In 1995, a solid catalyst system (the DETAL process) became available. The process eliminates catalyst neutralization and HF disposal. Consequently, most LAB plants built since then have utilized this process.Linear alkylbenzene 07/08-S7 Report, ChemSystems, February 2009. =Production details= Given the large scale applications of LAB-derived detergents, a variety routes have been developed to produce linear alkylbenzenes: *The HF/n-paraffins process involving dehydrogenation of n-paraffins to olefins, and subsequent reaction with benzene using hydrogen fluoride as catalyst.

It includes a PACOL Stage where n-paraffins are converted to mono-olefins (typically internal mono-olefins), a DEFINE Unit whose primary function is to convert residual diolefins to mono-olefins, a PEP Unit which is essentially an aromatic removal unit - introduced before the alkylation step to improve LAB yield and quality, an alkylation step where mono-olefins, both internal and alpha olefins, are reacted with benzene to produce LAB in the presence of HF catalyst. * The DETAL process involving dehydrogenation of n-paraffins to olefins, and subsequent reaction with benzene using a fixed bed catalyst. This is newer technology and has several of the stages depicted in the HF/n-paraffins process, but it is principally different in the benzene alkylation step, during which a solid-state catalyst is employed. There is a developing transalkylation (TA) stage to the Detal process wherein any higher alkylated benzenes (HAB) are contacted with additional benzene over a transalkylation catalyst. * The Friedel-Crafts alkylation process involves chlorination of n-paraffins to monochloroparaffins followed by alkylation of benzene using aluminum chloride (AlCl3) catalyst. This method is one of the oldest commercial routes to LABs. Each process generates LAB products with distinct features. Important product characteristics include the bromine index, sulfonatability, amount of 2-phenyl isomers (2-phenylalkane), the tetralin content, amount of non-alkylbenzene components, and the linearity of the product. The production of n-paraffins often occurs as part of an integrated LAB plant where the producers start from kerosene as raw material. The UOP process for producing normal paraffin includes a kerosene prefractionation unit, a hydrotreating unit and a Molex unit. The ExxonMobil Chemical technology includes a recovery process and can produce LAB grade n-paraffins from most medium to low sulfur kerosene without the use of a hydrotreater stage upstream. A desulfurization process is needed to reduce the sulfur content of some n-paraffins Applications Linear alkylbenzene is sulfonated to produce linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), a biodegradable surfactant. LAS replaced branched dodecylbenzene sulfonates, which were phased out because they biodegrade more slowly. =Niche uses= LAB was identified as a promising liquid scintillator by the SNO+ neutrino detector due to its good optical transparency (≈20 m), high light yield, low amount of radioactive impurities, and its high flash point (140 °C) which makes safe handling easier. It is also available in large volumes at a relatively low cost at the SNO+ site.About the SNO+ Detector at the SNO+ web site It is now used in several other neutrino detectors, such as the RENO and Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiments. The material performs well in deep underwater environments. One study suggested LAB as a suitable material to be employed in a Secret Neutrino Interactions Finder (SNIF), a type of antineutrino detector designed to detect the presence of nuclear reactors at distances of between 100 and 500 km. Environmental considerations LAB has been subject to concern about its effect on the environment and human health. European Council Regulation (EC) 1488/94European Council Regulations (EC) 1488/94 led to it being extensively evaluated. The life-cycle analysis considered the emissions and resulting environmental and human exposures. Following the exposure assessment, the environmental risk characterization for each protection target in the aquatic, terrestrial and soil compartment was determined. For human health the scenarios for occupational exposure, consumer exposure and human exposure indirectly via the environment have been examined and the possible risks identified. The report concludes that there are no concerns for the environment or human health. There is no need for further testing or risk reduction measures beyond those currently practiced. LAB was therefore de- classified and was removed from Annex 1 in the 28th ATP (Directive 2001/59).

They are small (less than 15 μm), and can be found in aerobic and anaerobic environments. The order Jakobida, believed to be monophyletic, consists of only twenty species at present, and was classified as a group in 1993. There is ongoing research into the mitochondrial genomes of jakobids, which are unusually large and bacteria-like, evidence that jakobids may be important to the evolutionary history of eukaryotes. Molecular phylogenetic evidence suggests strongly that jakobids are most closely related to Heterolobosea (Percolozoa) and Euglenozoa. Structure and Biology Jakobids have two flagella, inserted in the anterior end of the cell, and, like other members of order Excavata, have a ventral feeding groove and associated cytoskeleton support. The posterior flagella has a dorsal vane and is aligned within the ventral groove, where it generates a current that the cell uses for food intake. The nucleus is generally in the anterior part of the cell and bears a nucleolus. Most known jakobids have one mitochondrion, again located anteriorly, and different genera have flattened, tubular, or absent cristae. Food vacuoles are mostly located on the cell posterior, and in most jakobids the endoplasmic reticulum is distributed throughout the cell. The sessile, loricate Histionidae and occasionally free-swimming Jakoba libera (Jakobidae) have extrusomes under the dorsal membrane that are theorized to be defensive structures. Ecology Jakobids are widely dispersed, having been found in soil, freshwater, and marine habitats, but generally not common. However, environmental DNA surveys suggest that Stygiellidae are abundant in anoxic marine habitats. Some are capable of surviving hypersaline and anoxic environments, though the Histionids have only been found in freshwater ecosystems, where they attach themselves to algae or zooplankton. Outside of obligate sessile species, many species of jakobids can attach temporarily to surfaces, using either of the two flagella or the cell body itself. All known jakobids are heterotrophic suspension feeders. Their primary prey is generally considered to be bacteria, though one species has been observed eating extremely small (< 1 µm) eukaryotic cells. Jakobids are generally slow swimmers, with low clearance rates relative to similar organisms. No study has suggested jakobids might be pathogenic or toxic. Mitochondrial DNA Since jakobids have no current commercial use, most research into jakobids has focused on their evolutionary significance. The mitochondrial DNA of jakobids is the most bacteria-like of all known eukaryotic mitochondrial DNA, suggesting that jakobid mitochondrial genomes might approximate the ancestral mitochondrial genome. Jakobid mitochondrial DNA is substantially different from most other eukaryotes, especially in terms of the number of genes (nearly 100 in some species) and bacteria-like elements within their genomes. Nine of the genes have never been found in eukaryotic mitochondrial DNA. Uniquely, jakobid mitochondrial genomes code for bacteria-type RNA polymerase, as opposed to typical eukaryotic mitochondrial RNA polymerase, referred to as “phage-type”, which appears to be viral in origin. This does not necessarily mean that jakobids are basal to the phylogeny of eukaryotes. While jakobid mitochondria have genetic features that seem to have developed from bacteria, and apparently lack phage-type RNA, it is possible that other eukaryotic clades lost their bacterial features independently. Several proposed possibilities might explain the bacterial features of jakobid mitochondrial DNA. One is that jakobids diverged very early from the rest of the eukaryotes. This hypothesis depends on whether or not jakobids are indeed basal to all living eukaryotes, but there is no evidence yet to support that suggestion. Another hypothesis is that the phage-type RNA polymerase moved from one eukaryote group to another via lateral gene transfer, replacing the bacteria- type enzyme, and simply did not reach the jakobids. This would not depend on jakobids being basal to eukaryotes as a whole, but has not been widely studied. A third possibility is the reverse of the others, suggesting that the phage-type RNA polymerase is the basal one. Under this scenario, jakobids acquired their bacteria-type RNA polymerase much more recently and that then spread via lateral gene transfer. However, the gene arrangement of jakobid mitochondrial DNA suggests an ancestral origin of bacteria-type RNA polymerase over a more-recent divergence. One of the proposed scenarios suggests that the common ancestor of eukaryotes had two mitochondrial RNA polymerases, both phage-type and bacteria-type, and jakobids lost their phage-type polymerase while the rest of the eukaryotes lost the bacteria-type, possibly several times. Such a model eliminates the need for jakobids to be truly basal. One study proposed that the phage-type and bacteria-type polymerases, when present in the same mitochondrion, served different functions, much in the way that the organelles of land plants have two different RNA polymerase enzymes that transcribe different genes. Taxonomy Jakobida contains five families consisting of mostly free-swimming genera: Jakobidae, Moramonadidae, Andaluciidae, and Stygiellidae. The sixth family, Histionidae, is largely populated by sessile loricate genera, and includes the first jakobids ever described. Jakobids are a monophyletic group, and are most closely related to the Euglenozoa and Heterolobosea. * Class Jakobea Cavalier-Smith 1999 ** Order Jakobida Cavalier-Smith 1993 *** Sub Order Andaluciina Cavalier-Smith 2013 **** Family Andaluciidae Cavalier-Smith 2013 ***** Genus Andalucia Lara et al. 2006 ****** Species Andalucia godoyi Lara et al. 2006 **** Family Stygiellidae Pánek, Táborský & Čepička 2015 ***** Genus Velundella Pánek, Táborský & Čepička 2015 ****** Species V. nauta Pánek, Táborský & Čepička 2015 ****** Species V. trypanoides Pánek, Táborský & Čepička 2015 ***** Genus Stygiella Pánek, Táborský & Čepička 2015 non Bruand 1853 ****** Species S. incarcerata (Bernard, Simpson & Patterson 2000) Pánek, Táborský & Čepička 2015 [Jakoba incarcerata Bernard, Simpson & Patterson 2000; Andalucia incarcerata (Bernard, Simpson & Patterson 2000) Lara et al. 2006] ****** Species S. agilis Pánek, Táborský & Čepička 2015 ****** Species S. cryptica Pánek, Táborský & Čepička 2015 ****** Species S. adhaerens Pánek, Táborský & Čepička 2015 *** Sub Order Histonina Cavalier-Smith 1993 **** Species ?Jakoba bahamiensis Burger & Lang (indeitum) **** Species ?Jakoba echidna O'Kelly 1991 **** Family Moramonadidae Strassert et al. 2016 ***** Genus Moramonas Strassert et al. 2016 ****** Species Moramonas marocensis Strassert et al. 2016 ***** Genus Seculamonas Marx et al. 2003 nomen nudum ****** Species Seculamonas ecuadoriensis Marx et al. 2003 nomen nudum **** Family Jakobidae Patterson 1990 ***** Genus Jakoba Patterson 1990 ****** Species Jakoba libera (Ruinen 1938) Patterson 1990 [Cryptobia libera Ruinen 1938] **** Family Histionidae Flavin & Nerad 1993 ***** Genus Stomatochone Pascher 1942 ****** Species S. infundibuliformis Pascher 1942 ****** Species S. cochlear Pascher 1942 ****** Species S. excavata Pascher 1942 ****** Species S. epiplankton Pascher 1942 ***** Genus Stenocodon Pascher 1942 ****** Species Stenocodon epiplankton Pascher 1942 ***** Genus Reclinomonas Flavin & Nerad 1993 ****** Species R. americana Flavin & Nerad 1993 ****** Species R. campanula (Penard 1921) Flavin & Nerad 1993 [Histiona campanula Penard 1921; Stenocodon campanula (Penard 1921) Pascher 1942] ***** Genus Histiona Voigt 1902 [Zachariasia Voigt 1901 non Lemmermann 1895] ****** Species ?H. planctonica Scourfield 1937 ****** Species H. aroides Pascher 1943 ****** Species H. velifera (Voigt 1901) Pascher 1943 [Zachariasia velifera Voigt 1901; Histiona zachariasii Voigt 1901 nom. illeg.] See also *Loukozoa References ","title":"Jakobid"},{"id":"22761699","text":"Guj may refer to: * Guz, an obsolete unit of length * Gujarat Airways * Gujarati language ","title":"Guj"},{"id":"22761701","text":"Pasupateeswarar temple, Karur is located in karur and is one of the seven Sivastalams in Kongu Nadu.

The Mortal Instruments is chronologically the third series of a proposed five in The Shadowhunter Chronicles but it was the first one published. It follows Clarissa Fray (who interacts with a group of Nephilim known as Shadowhunters) while also discovering her own heritage and her family history. The Shadowhunters protect the world of mundane people, who are also called mundanes or \\"mundies\\", from dark forces beyond their world. The book series has become popular within the young adult genre of paranormal romance/urban fantasy and supernatural, but Clare did not originally intend to write the series for teens. When she began writing City of Bones, she did not view it as a young adult work, but first and foremost as a fantasy novel, where the main characters just happened to be teenagers. When she was approached by a publisher interested in aging up her characters, she ultimately decided that she \\"wanted to tell a story about characters at that crucial life stage just between adolescence and adulthood, where your choices determine the kind of person you're going to be rather than reflecting who you already are.\\" Novels # City of Bones (March 27, 2007) # City of Ashes (March 25, 2008) # City of Glass (March 23, 2009) # City of Fallen Angels (April 5, 2011) # City of Lost Souls (May 8, 2012) #* The Shadowhunter's Codex (October 29, 2013) # City of Heavenly Fire (May 27, 2014) # city of chain #* The Bane Chronicles (Print Edition November 11, 2014) #* Tales From the Shadowhunter Academy (Print Edition November 15, 2016) Main characters *Clarissa \\"Clary\\" Adele Fray/Fairchild is the sister of Jonathan Christopher Morgenstern, and the daughter of Valentine Morgenstern and Jocelyn Fairchild. To protect Clary, Jocelyn changes her surname to Fray in order to stay away from the shadow world. Clary is described as having long, curly red hair and bright green eyes. She is very short, \\"a little over five feet\\" as first described in City of Bones and often viewed as younger than her actual age. In the first book, Clary turns 16 years old, about as old as Isabelle Lightwood. Clary is an artist, and at the start of the first book, City of Bones, it is at first believed that she is a mundane, an ordinary human because her mother kept it a secret from her. It is later revealed that she is a Shadowhunter, or Nephilim: a human with angelic qualities. Clary is described as being stubborn and often rushes into dangerous situations without considering the consequences. Her best friend in the series is Simon Lewis. He is in love with her, but she is romantically involved with Jace (who uses various surnames). Clary is devastated when she is told that Jace is her brother but later learns that this is untrue. Clary discovers she can create her own runes, an ability that was caused by the extra angel blood her father, Valentine Morgenstern, administered to her while she was in her mother's womb. In the first few books, Clary has a tense relationship with the Lightwood siblings. Alec Lightwood, Jace's parabatai or best friend, is seemingly jealous of Clary's relationship with Jace since he is in love with Jace however as they are parabatai they can't be together, while Izzy Lightwood shows hostility towards Clary at the beginning since she thinks Clary is just a normal human being. *Jonathan Christopher \\"Jace\\" Herondale (also referred to as Wayland, Morgenstern, and Lightwood) is described as being tall and muscular with scars across his golden skin from faded magical marks called runes. He has wavy gold hair and golden eyes, and, like Clary, is a Shadowhunter. Jace is among the Nephilim's best fighters, since Izzy stated that he's killed more demons than anybody his age, and readily defends his family. Jace is often flirty and insensitive, and is described as projecting a false arrogance due to an insecurity that he is not good enough. Throughout the books, Jace's biological family is unknown until the last few books, although he refers to Isabelle, Alec, and Max as his siblings, and Maryse and Robert Lightwood as his parents (since they adopted him). In City of Bones, he believes he is a Wayland but at the end of the book Valentine Morgenstern falsely tells him that he is Jace's father. In City of Glass, Jace learns that his biological father is actually Stephen Herondale. He goes by the surname of his adoptive family, the Lightwoods but changes it back to Herondale upon learning more about his true father. Like Clary, he has special powers which make him swift and graceful, caused by the extra angel blood he received while in his mother's womb. His parabatai is Alec Lightwood. Parabatai refers to a pair of Nephilim warriors who fight together as lifelong partners; this is represented as a permanent rune that allows both individuals to be connected to each other. *Simon Lewis is a tall, thin boy with a mop of curly brown hair, brown eyes, and wears glasses. He often wears T-shirts with gamer slogans. In City of Lost Souls, Simon describes himself as being a \\"hipster,\\" but his best friend, Clary, refers to him as a \\"geek\\". Simon is the only character to begin life as an ordinary human (called a mundane), but in City of Ashes he is transformed into a vampire. After becoming a vampire, he never ages and physically will remain 16 years old. He gets taken care of by Raphael Santiago. Valentine Morgenstern stabs Simon in the throat and slits his wrists for the one-fourth vampire blood needed to convert the Mortal Sword. Jace finds Simon and cuts his own wrist to let Simon drink his blood, thus resulting in Simon becoming a Daylighter. Simon is quirky and caring, often putting other people before himself. In City of Fallen Angels, Simon finds himself in a love triangle with the characters of Maia Roberts and Isabelle Lightwood; however, in City of Lost Souls he chooses Isabelle over Maia. In City of Heavenly fire he makes a deal with a demon to take his immortality and memory so he and his friends could get out of Edom. He was human again and did not remember the Shadow World until he started training to become a Shadowhunter. *Isabelle \\"Izzy\\" Sophia Lightwood is a 16 years old Shadowhunter that is described as tall, thin, and beautiful. She has long black hair and black eyes, and is often carrying her trademark gold electrum whip, as shown in City of Bones, where Izzy attracted a shape-shifter blue-haired demon in the Pandemonium. Isabelle is described as being incredibly girly but with a fierce attitude. She often seems flirty and cannot hold a serious relationship, until she becomes interested in Simon Lewis. In City of Lost Souls, she admits to being in love with Simon Lewis and in City of Heavenly Fire she becomes Simon Lewis' girlfriend. *Alexander \\"Alec\\" Gideon Lightwood is the oldest Lightwood sibling. Alec is a Shadowhunter with floppy black hair and blue eyes. He is described as being quiet but protective of his younger siblings: Isabelle and Max, the latter of whom dies in City of Glass. Alec believes he is in love with Jace, his best friend and parabatai in the first book, City of Bones, until he meets Magnus Bane. In City of Glass, Alec kisses Magnus in front of his parents, revealing to them that he is gay. In City of Fallen Angels and City of Lost Souls, Alec becomes insecure about his and Magnus' relationship because of Magnus' immortality and considerable romantic history. This insecurity leads him to consider turning Magnus into a mortal against his will, which causes Magnus to end their relationship in City of Lost Souls. However, Magnus and Alec eventually reconcile in City of Heavenly Fire. *Magnus Bane is the self-described freewheeling bisexual High Warlock of Brooklyn. Magnus is an approximately 800-year-old warlock who appears to be 19. He is tall and thin with jet black hair and amber and green cat eyes. Magnus Bane is often described as glittery, and he throws countless parties with Downworlders. Magnus is involved with Jocelyn, Clary's mom, to erase Clary's memories of the Shadow World. Magnus begins a relationship with Alec Lightwood and therefore feels obliged to become the New York Shadowhunters' \\"pet\\" warlock to impress him. Magnus appears in the prequel to The Mortal Instruments - The Infernal Devices - and the sequel - The Dark Artifices as well as in a series of 10 short stories describing some of the more major events that occurred in Magnus Bane's life before the events of The Mortal Instruments which have been collected in an anthology titled The Bane Chronicles. In The Bane Chronicles, Magnus is romantically involved with a vampire named Camille and various others which are never again mentioned. His parents are an unnamed Indonesian woman and the demon Asmodeus. *Lucian \\"Luke\\" Garroway/Graymark is a former Shadowhunter and the former second-in-command of the Circle. When he was younger he was best friends and parabatai with Valentine. However he was soon betrayed by Valentine who led him into a trap where he was bitten by a werewolf, causing him to become one. He was the leader of the Manhattan werewolf pack, proceeded by Maia Roberts. His fiancée is Jocelyn Fairchild and he is Clary's step-father. He is described as calm, level-headed and righteous. He is also fiercely loyal to his loved ones. *Jocelyn Fray/Fairchild is a Shadowhunter, a former member of the circle, and the mother of Clary and Jonathan Christopher Morgenstern. She was once married to Valentine but following the birth of their first child, Jonathan, she learned that Valentine mixed demon blood into her food, thus making Jonathan into a monster. Valentine again mixed angel blood into Jocelyn's food, unaware that she was pregnant with Clary. After he faked his and Jonathan's deaths, Jocelyn left Idris and moved to Brooklyn where she gave birth to Clary. Every two years Jocelyn had Magnus Bane cast a block on Clary's \\"Sight\\" or \\"inner eye,\\" to prevent her from seeing the Shadow world. In City of Bones she self- induces a coma to prevent Valentine learning the whereabouts of the Mortal Cup. She is reawakened in City of Glass. She is currently engaged to her childhood friend, Luke Garroway. Her current surname, Fray is revealed to be a portmanteau of her initial maiden name, Fairchild, and that of Tessa Gray, a warlock seen in City Of Heavenly Fire, and the prequel series, The Infernal Devices. *Valentine Morgenstern is Clary and Jonathan Christopher Morgenstern's biological father, and is Jace Herondale's adoptive father. He's the main antagonist for the first three books of the series. *Jonathan Christopher (Sebastian) Morgenstern is Clary's brother. Like her, he is a Shadowhunter, but he was born with demon blood in his veins. It was administered to him by his father, Valentine, while his mother, Jocelyn, was pregnant. Jonathan is described as having pitch black eyes with no whites (as a baby, but when he is older, they are simply black on the inside), a sharply angled face, and blonde, pale hair. At the end of City Of Heavenly Fire the evil is burnt out of him, and his eyes turn green. He dies soon after admitting and apologizing for his wrongdoings to Clary and their mother. He's the main antagonist for the second three books of the series. Critical reception City of Bones was popular at the time of release, reaching #8 on the New York Times Best Seller list (Children's books) in April 2007. City of Ashes was one of the YALSA's top ten teen books for 2009. Publishers Weekly commented that it \\"is a sprawling urban fantasy packed with just about every type of creature known to the genre\\". Locus praised the book as \\"a highly readable first novel\\".Locus - \\"The Mortal Instruments, Book One: City of Bones\\", Faren Miller, June 2007 Booklist said that there was \\"plenty of romance, loss, honor, and betrayal to make the journey worthwhile. An experienced storyteller, Clare moves the plot quickly to a satisfying end.\\" School Library Journal said \\"Though the story is hampered by predictability and overblown writing, Clare continues her talent for mixing hip, modern humor with traditional fantasy, and fans eagerly awaiting the series conclusion should come away more than satisfied.\\" A review in the School Library Journal noted that the book contained a variety of narrative flaws including characters that were \\"sporadically characterized\\" and whose behavior was predictable. In spite of this they noted that the book was entertaining and would leave readers anticipating the next installment. The series has been in the New York Times Best Sellers List for 102 consecutive weeks as of September 5, 2013, and No. 1 for 9 weeks straight, knocking series such as The Hunger Games and Percy Jackson and The Olympians off the top spot. The last time The Mortal Instruments spent 100 consecutive weeks on the best sellers list was in May 2012. On August 29, 2013, City of Bones topped the USA Today's Best Sellers List, which made it the Best Seller Book of the country at the time. Four other Mortal Instruments books also made the list. City of Ashes was No. 8, City of Glass was No. 20, City of Fallen Angels was 35 and City of Lost Souls was No. 46. Themes Revised Version: The main theme revolving around each of her works is the idea of self-acceptance and coming into one's own in relation to the choices we make and the consequences that follow. Clare focuses on heavy subject throughout her novels. Some of those topics would be: * Religion * Prejudice * Jealousy * Love * Art and Culture * Appearances * LGBTQ Lifestyles * Love Cassandra Clare writes multiple characters where in a world surrounded by religion, the character's conflict is that of their own sexuality in the mix of the entirety of the plot. Such as with one of the main characters, Alec who is a Shadowhunter having a relationship with Magnus Bane who is a Warlock. In the fictional world of this series the two fictional creatures would not be accepted in a relationship, it is a parallel of how in the mortal world LGBTQ+ people are not easily welcomed by others. This is just one example of how Cassandra Clare reaches her thousands of audiences through her series' themes. Her series stands out from other Young Adult fiction series as she implements realistic struggles into her characters lives and progressively has them overcome them in the series. Popular culture and historical references In City of Ashes, the Faerie Realm and its inhabitants are characters from Holly Black's faerie series, beginning with Tithe: A Modern Faerie Tale. Also, the characters Val and Luis from Valiant: A Modern Tale of Faerie appear in another scene in that book. Within Holly Black's third book, Ironside: A Modern Faery's Tale, there is a reference to the Mortal Cup mentioned in the Mortal Instruments series. Clare delved deeply into world mythology in order to build the Shadowhunter world featured in The Mortal Instruments, The Infernal Devices, and all other offshoots of the series. There are strong influences from Paradise Lost and The Inferno; while there are many references to Western religious mythology, Clare also studied world mythology deeply, specifically demonic myth featured in Japanese, Tibetan, and other Eastern cultural texts. Her references to angels and nephilim throughout the series also come from this study of world religions and folklore. These myths were then adapted to fit into her stories. Further books in the seriesPrequels= Cassandra Clare has written a series of prequels called The Infernal Devices set in the same universe as The Mortal Instruments, but in Victorian London. This series consists of three books: Clockwork Angel, published on August 31, 2010, Clockwork Prince, published December 6, 2011, and Clockwork Princess, published March 19, 2013. The main characters in this series are Will Herondale, Tessa Gray, and Jem Carstairs, who reside in the London Institute. Out of all the Shadowhunter chronicles, the Infernal Devices is recommended to be read first, as it is a great introduction to the world and a fan favorite. There is a sequel series to The Infernal Devices called The Last Hours set in the same universe detailing the adventures of the next generation of Shadowhunters almost two decades after the events of Clockwork Princess. The series will consist of three books: Chain of Gold, Chain of Iron, and Chain of Thorns. In reading the prequel series, readers will find strong connections between the main characters in The Mortal Instruments and the protagonists of The Infernal Devices, not just in similarity of characterization but in actual familial connections. First editions of The Clockwork Princess, the final book in this trilogy, include a family tree that links the characters in The Infernal Devices with the generations of The Mortal Instruments and The Dark Artifices. One of the main characters from The Infernal Devices also takes part in the last three Mortal Instruments books (with another one joining in the last book), in addition to Magnus Bane, who takes part in all Mortal Instruments and Infernal Devices books. =Sequels= This is a new series of sequels called The Dark Artifices set in the same universe as The Mortal Instruments, but five years in the future. It is be a trilogy with many new characters (plus some from City of Heavenly Fire) and the focus will shift from New York to the Los Angeles Institute. The first book, Lady Midnight, was published on March 8, 2016. The second book, Lord of Shadows was released on May 23, 2017. The third and final book, Queen of Air and Darkness was published on December 4, 2018. =Offshoots= Cassandra Clare, Sarah Rees Brennan and Maureen Johnson have written a complementary series of ten short stories called The Bane Chronicles that recount the experiences of the Warlock Magnus Bane character from The Mortal Instruments series.

The series consists of ten books that have been released over the course of 2015. The books and release dates are: Welcome to Shadowhunter Academy, February 17; The Lost Herondale, March 17; The Whitechapel Fiend, April 21; Nothing but Shadows, May 19; The Evil We Love, June 16; Pale Kings and Princes, July 21; Bitter of Tongue, August 18; The Fiery Trial, September 15; Born to Endless Night, October 20; and Angels Twice Descending, November 17. AdaptationsGraphic novels= There were graphic novel versions of her series released within the past several years to appeal to an even wider audience. Half Of The City of Bones, The Clockwork Angel, The Clockwork Prince, and The Clockwork Princess have all been released in graphic novel form by Th3rd World Publishing. =Film= In 2010, Screen Gems announced that they were going into production on the film adaptation of City of Bones, the first book in The Mortal Instruments series, with hopes of starting a successful film franchise. The film was originally due for release on August 23, 2013, but was brought forward two days earlier, on August 21, 2013. The film premiered on August 12, 2013, at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. Production on a film adaptation of the second book, City of Ashes, was due to start in September 2013, but was delayed to 2014, and eventually cancelled, after the first film failed to recoup its budget. =Television= On October 12, 2014, at Mipcom, Constantin confirmed that The Mortal Instruments will return as a television series with Ed Decter as showrunner. Constantin Film and TV head Martin Moszkowicz told The Hollywood Reporter that, \\"It actually makes sense to do [the novels] as a TV series. There was so much from the book that we had to leave out of the Mortal Instruments film. In the series we'll be able to go deeper and explore this world in greater detail and depth.\\" The producers hope to adapt the entire book series if the TV adaptation proves successful. In February 2015, book series author Cassandra Clare announced via Twitter that the television series would be called Shadowhunters rather than The Mortal Instruments. In March 2015, ABC Family picked up Shadowhunters straight-to-series. The series was renewed for a second season in March 2016, consisting of 20 episodes, which premiered on January 2, 2017. In April 2017, it was announced that the series was renewed for a third season of 20 episodes. The first half of ten episodes premiered on March 20, 2018, while the second aired in mid-2018. The two-part series finale aired on May 6, 2019.

It is timetabled as route no. 952. Operation and History  Prien station Aschau station In 1875 after Theodor von Cramer-Klett had purchased Hohenaschau Castle and its associated property in the valley of the River Prien, he financed the construction of a railway line to Aschau. It was opened on 18 August 1878 and opened up the Prien valley to the main line from Munich to Salzburg. In the post-war period the line was worked by railbuses of Class VT 98. In 1987 these were modernised by the repair shop at Kassel and painted in white and mint-green livery. These modernised Chiemgau Railway railbuses were the only ones in the Bundesbahn fleet to be given a special paint scheme - all the others were painted in the red livery, then typical of multiples operated by the DB. The former Chiemgau Railway vehicles are in service today in tourist trains on the Kleinengstingen–Münsingen–Schelklingen–Ulm Hbf route (KBS 759) and known as the Ulmer Spatz (Ulm sparrows). As a result of this uniqueness there are several models by model railway manufacturers of the Chiemgau railbuses. In 1996 the Chiemgau Railway railbuses (798 652 and 798 653) were replaced by Class 628.4 units. At present RegionalBahn trains work the line from Aschau to Prien (one to two pairs of trains per hour). The 628's need 15 minutes for the 10 km long line. In the mornings and evenings there are trains that run via Prien to Rosenheim on the Munich–Salzburg line. In addition one train runs through each evening from Salzburg via Traunstein to Aschau.

It is used for wool, meat and vegetation management. Etymology The origin and meaning of the word steinschaf is unknown, though various theories have been advanced. History The Alpines Steinschaf is one of four breeds in the Steinschaf group, the others being the Krainer Steinschaf, the Montafoner Steinschaf and the Tiroler Steinschaf. They are variously thought to have derived from the mediaeval Zaupelschaf type, or from the older Torfschaf, and are believed to be the oldest sheep breeds of the eastern Alps. At the start of the twentieth century the Alpines Steinschaf was widely distributed in the eastern Alps. In Austria it was found mainly in Salzburg, but also in Carinthia, North and East Tirol and in Vorarlberg. In Germany it was common in the Bavarian districts of Berchtesgaden and Traunstein and in the south-east part of Rosenheim. In Italy it was present in the Eisacktal, the Passeiertal, the upper Pustertal and in the upper Vinschgau, in the autonomous province of Bolzano; by 1964 the population in this area had fallen to below 1000 head. In 2009 the Alpines Steinschaf was named \\"endangered livestock breed of the year\\" by the German Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen, a national association for the conservation of historic and endangered breeds of domestic animals. In 2014, it was listed as \\"extremely endangered\\" on the red list of endangered animal breeds of the GEH. A total population of 491–650 was reported by Austria in 2012; Germany reported 791 head in 2013. Characteristics The Alpines Steinschaf is a fine-boned mountain breed of small to medium size. Rams weigh , and ewes . All coat colours are found. The face and lower legs are without wool; the legs are thin but strong, and the hooves hard. Rams are often horned, ewes less often so. The ears are carried horizontally or slightly drooping. The face and ears may be marked with black.

Biography  Born in Grenoble, Isère, France, he started his primary education at La Verpillere, Ecole Les Marronnier (Grenoble) and completed it at Ecole Jean Jaurès in Lyon. He graduated from Dumlupinar High School in Mersin and continued his education in Selçuk University in Konya and studied French Language and Literature and Sociology. He completed his master's degree in Anthropology at Ankara University, Faculty of Language, History and Geography. He is a member of the International Association of Writers (International PEN). His poetical works have been published in literary magazines: Varlık, Journal, Turkish Language, Le Poete Travaille, Tohum, Çalı, and Türk Dili. Kurt is a mystical, humanist, existentialist and sufist poet. All of his poems are written in Turkish and French and his work has come to form a sense of questioning the place of man and his deeds in his world. His tone of voice is severe but melodic. His third book Hüznün Sözyitimleri (Speechlessness of Sadness) was publishing in 1998. It consists of three parts \\"Deterritorial, Agnostic and Incognitae\\". We are given the loneliness, alienation, individualism and rebellion created by modern world. The subject matter gives Kurt's poetry its peculiar quality. As the author casts these subjects into his lines,he uses a sharp and complex style. His stanzas variegate in length and his poetry disturbs and re-forms the routine language. The word combinations strikingly violate the order with outstanding, unexpected images. His free-verse often depends on the cadence or grouping of phrases, and the reading depends on either a slowing down or a speeding up till it reaches an emphasis in the final lines. There is a yearning for a better and meaningful life. He pictures man lost in a universe sometimes conscious of his own position. For Seyhan Kurt, man has made the worst of himself and therefore is helplessly lonely. For his art, we can conclude that \\"the surface of the world and mankind have lost their privacy.\\" One feels driven into a world which he has no control of.Faculty of Sciences and Humanities, English Language and Literature - Konya, 2002, by Emre Dagli, Ass. Prof. Dr. Gülbün Onur. Fighting without weapons in Kurt's poetry For Seyhan Kurt the ideologies of profiteering for war is the most dangerous paradigm in this age. Kurt processed; human freedom, destructiveness of war, fascism, capitalism, racism and sexual discrimination, loneliness and pure love, basically in his works. Has worked to implement the theory of the \\"superior love\\" against the Nietzsche's idea of \\"superior human\\" in his poems. According to him,love is over religion and do not have nationality, race and have no country. In this regard; he emphasizes the need to oppose the war and every kind of oppression, discrimination. According to Kurt, the 20th century is the most brutal century in human history. But the poet is not hopeless: is trying to explain that, the thing which liberate, people is critical thinking and empathy. He sees art and philosophy as an aim rather than as a tool, just as Socrates, Gandhi, Rumi and other sufists. Revolt in Seyhan Kurt's Speechlessness of Sadness The subject that is treated densely from the beginning to the end of the work is revolt. In order to manage to explain his rebelliousness, the poet appeals to complex images. He is like wanting to \\"slap\\" the readers. This is why the expressions are sharp and hard. We come across the manner of Rimbaud in his Une Saison en Enfer, the expression of the union of the subject treated in Les Chants de Maldoror of Lautréamont in Hüznün Sözyitimleri. The situation in which the earth is and the powers of evil have whipped up the soul of the author. Armed men are invaded the world and innocent people are killed by their arms: \\"Öldürüyorlar (ölüyorlar). Her silah için ayrı bir uzmanlık dalı, her kurşun için milimetrik sayılar yaratılıyor\\" (p. 23) Death, for the poet, is going to reach everyone. But what is important is how this will occur. Seyhan Kurt complains that thousands of people are making efforts for arms. He thinks that mankind is unaware of what kind of a disaster they are able to cause. Besides this, the poet is restless of the comfort he has while expressing this: \\"Korkunçluk burada değil; bunu yazabilmemdeki rahatlıkta\\" (p. 23) He is trying, too to express the dangers for the future of children. The arms from now on are reaching children, too. There is no importance of this for capital owners. When we look at page 34, we have children facing arms more dangerous than G3 or M16. These arms are what technology brings and they symbolize the degeneration of cultures.

Biography He was the son of Antoine Jean Caiez d’Épinay and Marie Marthe Blanc. Adrien d'Épinay was a lawyer and politician from Mauritius who at the beginning of the 19th century helped found the Société royale des Arts et des Sciences de l'île Maurice, the Bank of Mauritius and the first independent and daily newspaper in Mauritius, Le Cernéen, after the Portuguese name for the island. He started his career at the bar in Port Louis in 1816. He married Marguerite Le Breton de la Vieuville on 14 April 1817 in Flacq, and was the father of the sculptor Prosper d'Épinay (1836–1914), whose greatest works which can be seen today in Port-Louis, Mauritius were undoubtedly the bronze statues of King Edward VII, of Governor Stevenson and the statue of his father Adrien d'Épinay which was unveiled on 26 September 1866 in the French East India Company garden at Port-Louis. Prosper also created statues of Mauritius Governor William Stevenson, Edward VII and his spouse Alexandra of Denmark.Prosper d'Épinay @ Potomitan On the death of Charles Thomi Pitot (1779–1821), Adrien d’Épinay, aged twenty-seven years, became the political leader and devoted his talents to the service of the island. He was criticised for opposing the abolition of slavery without a financial compensation and for making representations to the British Government in London in 1831 and in 1833 on behalf of sugar planters who were slave owners. By so doing he negotiated a compensation for farmers, for the loss of their slaves, and who had to organise themselves to find replacement workers on the sugar estates. To the benefit of Mauritius he also secured the right of colonists to serve on the Legislative Council, the abolition of monopoly, the establishing of a police force, the prosecution of abuse related to alcohol, and the lifting of censorship of the press. He also proposed a University in Mauritius where, among other subjects, Law would be taught. With his half-brother Prosper (1780-1856), he founded the newspaper “Le Cernéen” whose first number appeared on 14 February 1832. His construction of the first steam-driven sugar mill at Argy near Quatre Cocos, was of great benefit to the sugar industry. On 22 July 1832, a crowd of supporters invaded his residence, acclaimed the benefits which he had brought the country, requested that his daughter be adopted by the colony and that she be named Mauricia. Despite his positive contributions to the country, he left Mauritius in 1839 under a cloud, the victim of colonial politics, and died prematurely in France on 9 December of the same year. His remains were returned to Mauritius and interred at the Pamplemousses Cemetery on 1 June 1840. His library of more than 3000 volumes was bequeathed to the Collège Royal in Port Louis in 1839, and today forms part of the Bibliothèque Carnegie, but is threatened by inadequate preservation and restoration. The former house of d'Épinay, a masterpiece of colonial architecture, was converted by the State into a school bearing the name of Dr. Onésipho Beaugeard, and in 2006 was scheduled for razing by the Ministry of Education.

It can be found in mostly fresh waters (occasionally in brackish waters) of estuaries and the tidal zones of rivers. It can also be found in the aquarium trade, where it is often marketed as the knight goby.  Description  There are two dorsal fins on this gray-blue fish: the first consists of about six stiffly held rays (often with a black blotch); the second is equal in length to the long-based anal fin. Both carry dark spots. This species can reach a length of SL.  Aquarium care  The Knight Goby should be kept singly with other mid-level species. When placed in an aquarium with fish of the same species quarels may arise as this is a very territorial fish. It does best in low light, as bright light makes it skittish.

History In 1955, an excavation was carried out at this site by an Archaeological Survey of India team under the direction of B.K. Thapar. The excavation revealed a more than 17 m deep occupational deposit, belonging to four periods with a break between the earlier two and a continuous sequence thereafter. The periods of occupation are: On the confluence of the rivers Tapti and Gomai in Shahada Taluka, the site located to the s.-e. of the present village, with its longer axis running along the Gomai. An excavation was undertaken at this site by B.K. Thapar on behalf of the ASI in 1955. (AI, 20 and 21, 1964 and 1965,pp. 5–167). Period I (c. 1700-1300 B.C.) is Chalcolithic in its cultural content and is further divided into Sub-Periods IA and IB, the former being characterized by the occurrence of blades and microliths, hammer-stones, a restricted use of copper or low-grade bronze, and four ceramic industries. Sub-Period I B is distinguished by the intrusion of two more ceramic industries, viz. the black-painted red pottery of the Jorwe fabric and the Lustrous Red Ware. The other industries and crafts of the previous Sub-Period continue throughout the occupation. Period II (c. 700-100 B.C. with a margin on the earlier side), following after a time-gap, heralds the Iron Age, Stone implements like blades and microliths are replaced by tools of iron. The use of copper also becomes more common, though remaining subordinate to that of iron. Period III (Middle of the 2nd century B.C. to the end of the 6th century A.D.), which in its earlier levels overlaps with Period II and in the later levels with Period IV, does not introduce any revolutionary change. The characteristic ceramic industries of the preceding Period go into disuse and are replaced by a nondescript poorly made red ware. From a comparative study of the past flora and the present vegetation it may be concluded that the cover was forest, if the region on the whole has remained more or less of the same type. Taking these factors into consideration, it would be reasonable to infer that the climate and rainfall in the Khandesh region have not changed to any appreciable extent during the past 3500 years or so.

She was the niece of John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, to whom she was also heiress, and after his death the Earldom of Buchan was successfully claimed by her husband Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan, by right of his wife. His long struggle to claim her Earldom of Buchan was one of the causes of the Second War of Scottish Independence. Alice was the maternal grandmother of Blanche of Lancaster, and thus great-grandmother of King Henry IV of England. Family Alice was born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in 1289, the eldest daughter of Alexander Comyn, Sheriff of Aberdeen and his wife Joan le Latimer and the granddaughter of Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan. She had a younger sister, Margaret, who would later marry firstly Sir John Ross, and secondly Sir William Lindsay, Lord of Symertoun.Charles Cawley, Medieval Lands, Scottish Nobility, Earls of Buchan (Comyn) Alice's paternal grandparents were Alexander Comyn, 2nd Earl of Buchan, Justiciar and Constable of Scotland, and Elizabeth de Quincy; and her maternal grandparents were William le Latimer and Alicia Ledet. Alice's uncle was John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, one of the most powerful nobles in Scotland. The earl, who died in December 1308, was married to Isabella MacDuff, but the marriage was childless. Alice was John Comyn's heiress to the title of Countess of Buchan, although the earldom had been forfeited to the crown prior to her uncle's death in England to where he had gone as a fugitive. Marriage and issue Shortly before 14 July 1310, Alice married Henry de Beaumont, Lord Beaumont, the son of Louis de Brienne, Viscount de Beaumont and Agnes, Viscountess de Beaumont. Upon her marriage she was styled as Lady Beaumont. Henry was a key figure in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 13th and 14th centuries. (See main article: Wars of Scottish Independence) As a consequence of her marriage to Henry, Alice had become, in Scottish eyes, irretrievably English, therefore the Scots recognised her sister Margaret's right to the Earldom of Buchan rather than her own. The marriage produced ten children:http://www.thePeerage.com/p.10293.htm#102928 * Katherine de Beaumont (died 11 November 1368), married David III Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl, by whom she had issue. * Elizabeth de Beaumont (died 27 October 1400), married Nicholas Audley, 3rd Baron Audley. Died without issue. * Richard de Beaumont * John de Beaumont (died young) * Thomas de Beaumont * Alice de Beaumont * Joan de Beaumont, married Sir Fulk FitzWarin, 3rd Lord FitzWarin * Beatrice de Beaumont, married Charles I, Count of Dammartin * John de Beaumont, 2nd Lord Beaumont (1318- 14 April 1342), on 6 November 1330 married as her first husband, Eleanor of Lancaster, by whom he had issue. He was killed in a tournament. * Isabel de Beaumont (c.1320- 1361), married in 1337 Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, by whom she had two daughters, Maud, Countess of Leicester and Blanche of Lancaster. Countess of Buchan In April 1313, Isabella MacDuff, the widow of Alice's uncle John Comyn, was placed into the custody of the Beaumonts, following her release from her harsh imprisonment. She had been confined in a cage for four years in Berwick, England by the orders of King Edward I after she crowned Robert the Bruce king of Scotland at Scone in March 1306. In 1310, she was sent to a convent, and three years later was ordered to one of the Beaumont manors where she died on an unknown date. In 1314, Henry de Beaumont fought at the Battle of Bannockburn on the side of the English. Sometime between 1317 and 1321, Alice succeeded to the English estates of her younger sister, Margaret. On 22 January 1334, Alice's husband Henry was summoned to Parliament of England as the Earl of Buchan. He was recognised as earl from that date until 16 November 1339. On 10 February 1334, he sat in the Scottish Parliament bearing the same title. It was Henry's relentless pursuit of Alice's inherited earldom of Buchan which was one of the factors that lead to the Second War of Scottish Independence between the Comyns and their ancient rivals, the Bruces. Alice died on 3 July 1349 at the age of sixty. Her husband Henry had died in 1340 in the Low Countries where he had gone with King Edward III of England. With the death of Alice, the earldom of Buchan forever passed out of the Comyn family. Alice's numerous descendants included, Kings Henry IV of England and Henry V of England, Philippa of Lancaster, Anne Boleyn, and Humphrey Kynaston, the English highwayman. In fiction Alice Comyn appears as a character in Barbara Erskine's novel Kingdom of Shadows (1988), which is based upon the life of Isabella MacDuff.

In this type of survey electrical resistance meters are used to detect and map subsurface archaeological features and patterning.  Overview  Electrical resistance meters can be thought of as similar to the Ohmmeters used to test electrical circuits. Archaeological features can be mapped when they are of higher or lower resistivity than their surroundings. A stone foundation might impede the flow of electricity, while the organic deposits within a midden might conduct electricity more easily than surrounding soils. Although generally used in archaeology for planview mapping, resistance methods also have a limited ability to discriminate depth and create vertical profiles (see Electrical resistivity tomography). Further applications include the measurement of the electrical resistivity of concrete to determinate the corrosion potential in concrete structures. Electrical resistance surveying is one of the most popular geophysical methods thanks to the fact it is a nondestructive and economically favorable investigation. Instrumentation Electrical resistance survey of an archaeological site using a twin probe systemIn most systems, metal probes (electrodes) are inserted into the ground to obtain a reading of the local electrical resistance. A variety of probe configurations are used, most having four probes, often mounted on a rigid frame. In these systems, Two of the probes, called current probes, are used to introduce a current (either direct or low- frequency switching current) into the earth. The other two probes, called voltage or potential probes, are used to measure the voltage, which indicates the local resistivity. In general, greater probe spacings yield greater depth of investigation, but at the cost of sensitivity and spatial resolution.Clark, Anthony J. (1996). Seeing Beneath the Soil. Prospecting Methods in Archaeology. London, United Kingdom: B.T. Batsford Ltd. Arrangement of probes in a Wenner electrode array.Early surveys (beginning in the mid 20th century) often used the Wenner array, which was a linear array of four probes. These were arranged current-voltage-voltage-current, at equal distances across the array. Probes were mounted on a rigid frame, or placed individually. While quite sensitive, this array has a very wide span for its depth of investigation, leading to problems with horizontal resolution. A number of experimental arrays attempted to overcome the shortcomings of the Wenner array, The most successful of these being the twin-probe array, which has become the standard for archaeological use. The twin-probe array - despite its name - has four probes: one current and one voltage probe mounted on a mobile frame to collect survey readings, and the other current probe placed remotely along with a voltage reference probe. These fixed remote probes are connected to the mobile survey probes by a trailing cable. This configuration is very compact for its depth of investigation, resulting in superior horizontal resolution.Clark, Anthony J. (1996). Seeing Beneath the Soil. Prospecting Methods in Archaeology. London, United Kingdom: B.T. Batsford Ltd. The logistical advantage of the more compact array is somewhat offset by the trailing cable. A disadvantage of the systems described above is a relatively slow rate of survey. One solution to this has been wheeled arrays. These use spiked wheels or metal disks as electrodes, and may use a square array (a variation of the Wenner array) to avoid the encumbrance of a trailing cable. Wheeled arrays may be towed by vehicles or by human power. Systems having long linear arrays of many electrodes are often used in geological applications, and less commonly in archaeology. These take repeated measurements (often computer controlled) using different electrode spacings at multiple points along the extended line of electrodes.Broken Weblink Data collected in this way may be used for tomography, or generating vertical profiles. Capacitively coupled systems that do not require direct physical contact with the soil have also been developed. These systems are capable of tomographic studies as well as mapping horizontal patterning. They may also be used on hard or very dry surfaces that preclude electrical contact necessary for probe resistance systems. While these show promise for archaeological applications, currently available systems operating on this principle lack sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity. Benjamin Godber of Delisle Catholic science college of LeicestershireToby Lerone Marseilles University of science speciality (Balamory)  Data collection  Survey usually involves walking with the instrument along closely spaced parallel traverses, taking readings at regular intervals. In most cases, the area to be surveyed is staked into a series of square or rectangular survey \\"grids\\" (terminology can vary). With the corners of the grids as known reference points, the instrument operator uses tapes or marked ropes as a guide when collecting data. In this way, positioning error can be kept to within a few centimeters for high-resolution mapping. Early surveys recorded readings by hand, but computer controlled data logging and storage are now the norm.Clark, Anthony J. (1996). Seeing Beneath the Soil. Prospecting Methods in Archaeology.

Vanity Fair, 1898 Biography He was born at Broughton, Northamptonshire, the son of the Reverend Halford Burdett, a Leicestershire clergyman, and his wife Alsina. In 1863 he started his business career as a bank clerk in Birmingham, and was soon in charge of the local clearing at the Bank of England, where his business abilities became evident. In 1868 Burdett became secretary and general superintendent of the Queen's Hospital, Birmingham. In 1873 he enrolled there as a medical student, transferring later to Guy's Hospital, London. Later, between 1874 and 1880 he was secretary to the Dreadnought Seaman's Hospital. In 1880 he became secretary to the share and loan department of the London Stock Exchange and also a member of the committee of management of the Seamen's Hospital Society. Finance and hospitals, especially in connection with nursing, were the two main interests of his life. He helped to establish the British Hospitals Association in 1884. An important enlargement of the Stock Exchange was opened in January 1885, the addition being made of what is still called the New House. Three years before, in 1882, Burdett's Official Intelligence of Securities, the Stock Exchange encyclopaedia, had appeared for the first time. It had a precursor in The Railway Intelligence, and in 1899 its title was altered to The Stock Exchange Official Intelligence, the alteration not being without significance. Burdett's Hospitals and Charities appeared annually from 1889 and continued until the 1990s as the Health Services Year Book. He was made K.C.B. in the 1897 Diamond Jubilee Honours.

BiographyEarly life and education= Tord Bernhard Hagen was known to his friends as Bill, a nickname given to him as a young student in Uppsala. He lost his father early and his mother Ellen Hagen raised him and his sister Helga while pursuing a career in politics. =Career= After graduating from Uppsala University, Bill went on to pursue a career as a diplomat by joining the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His first deployment was at the Swedish embassy in London where he directly experienced the outbreak of World War II and the subsequent German bombings. He served as an attaché at the embassy from April 1939 to 1943. He also spent a few months in 1939 as substitute to the general counsel in Dublin. Bill would continue his career by spending the majority of his life abroad. In the forties and fifties he served at the Swedish legations in Ankara, Prague and Bonn. In Prague, he experienced the rise of communist influence in Eastern Europe and in Bonn he saw the development of Western European cooperation. His first position as ambassador came when Bill was offered to head the installation of a new embassy in Bangkok. He spent five years in Southeast Asia from 1959 to 1964 as ambassador of Thailand, also overseeing Cambodia, Burma and Vietnam. Bill then spent two years working at the ministry's headquarters in Stockholm before taking over the position as ambassador of Egypt in Cairo, where he also oversaw Sudan and Somalia. In Egypt Bill experienced several turbulent incidents such as the Six-Day War and the assassination of prime minister Wasfi al-Tal of Jordan. After six years in Cairo (1966–72) Bill and the family returned to Europe where Bill served as ambassador to the Netherlands 1972-77 and ambassador to Denmark 1977-80. Despite retiring from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1980 Bill continued working as he was appointed senior advisor to Volvo International where he spent several years working in Geneva and also made extensive travels to the Middle East. After ending his assignment at Volvo Bill began penning his memoirs which resulted in the book Ett liv i krig och fred (A life in war and peace) which was published in 2000. In June 1995 Bill appeared in the BBC documentary Myths and memories of World War 2 discussing the potential peace-treaty between England and Germany in 1940. =Marriage and children= In 1944 and 1946 Bill and his first wife Lena saw the birth of their children Robert and Cecilia.

The Cowboys are a franchise of the Pecos League, which is not affiliated with a Major League Baseball organization. They play their home games at historic Kokernot Field, a 1,200 seat stone and wrought-iron replica of Chicago's Wrigley Field that dates from 1948. History Alpine and the Big Bend region have a long baseball history. From 1947 to 1958, the Alpine Cowboys, owned by West Texas rancher and philanthropist Herbert L. Kokernot, Jr., won a dozen regional semi-pro championships and were national runners-up. The team featured future major league stars, including Norm Cash, Gaylord Perry, and Joe Horlen. At the end of championship seasons, Kokernot presented each team member with a pair of handmade red cowboy boots emblazoned with the brand of his \\"o6\\" Ranch—a tradition that continues with the current Cowboys' cap insignia. In 1959, the Boston Red Sox moved their minor league affiliate, the Lexington Red Sox of the Nebraska State League, to Alpine, and took the traditional name \\"Cowboys\\" for the team. The new Cowboys immediately won the Class D Sophomore League title and set the record for the highest winning percentage (88–35, .715) of any Red Sox minor league team. The 1959 champion team was managed by future Red Sox manager Eddie Popowski and featured three future major leaguers, pitcher Don Schwall, who two years later won the American League Rookie of the Year Awards; second baseman Chuck Schilling, who finished fourth behind Schwall in the same balloting; and pitcher Guido Grilli. The 1960 team featured future California Angels all-star Jim Fregosi. In 1962, the Sophomore League folded and the team moved to Idaho, becoming the Pocatello Chiefs of the Class C Pioneer League. Professional baseball returned to Alpine in 2009 with the Big Bend Cowboys of the Continental Baseball League. The team was founded by Frank Snyder, a Fort Worth law professor, who had previously founded the CBL's Texarkana Gunslingers and who brought several local investors from the Alpine area into the new team. It was successful on the field, losing in the league finals in 2009 to the Alexandria Aces, and winning the Ferguson Jenkins Trophy in 2010 as CBL champions. The CBL folded at the end of the 2010 season. The Cowboys were reorganized as a nonprofit corporation and along with another CBL team, the Las Cruces Vaqueros, became part of the new Pecos League for the 2011 season. Kokernot Field, Alpine, Texas (2008) In 1946, Herbert L. Kokernot, Jr., son of Texas cattle rancher and entrepreneur Herbert L. Kokernot, retooled the semi-professional baseball team the Alpine Cats into the Alpine Cowboys. While semi-professional teams were not uncommon in Texas at the time, the Alpine Cowboys had the unusual benefit of a brand new stadium, Kokernot Field, opened for them in 1947. Constructed at a cost of $1.5 million, the elaborately decorated stadium included imported infield clay shipped by train from Georgia. The Alpine Cowboys used the stadium as home base from 1947 through 1958, during which time they took a dozen titles in the regional and were runners up for a national championship. In addition to supporting the team and the region with a state of the art stadium, Kokernot also actively supported athletes in Alpine and elsewhere, bringing promising high school graduates onto the roster of the team and offering college scholarships to players throughout the southwest. In a 2007 article, The Fort Worth Star-Telegram described the team as \\"one of the state's finest semiprofessional teams\\". The team launched a number of baseball professionals, including two Hall of Fame inductees. Among them was coach Tom Chandler. Team members included Gaylord Perry and Norm Cash. In the days of segregation in Texas, Kokernot arranged for many exhibition games between traveling Negro League teams--led by such stars as Satchel Paige--and visiting Mexican League teams. Those exhibitions drew fans from hundreds of miles away.

The Mitterteich site is the largest location of the Business Segment Tubing of Schott AG. Other locations are in Mainz, Germany, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Vadodara, India. Locations of Business Segment Tubing - © SCHOTT AG Company history The history of glass production in Mitterteich dates back to 1883. In 1930 the glass factory in Mitterteich was affiliated to the Grünenplan factory of SCHOTT AG. In 1885 Otto Schott invented the chemically resistant borosilicate glass which was also produced in tubing form. In 1911: a tubing glass was developed which was especially well suited for the production of ampoules. The glass was registered in 1911 under the trade name FIOLAX and is still today one of SCHOTT AG most important products. After the Second World War, from 1947 to 1948 production of FIOLAX glass tubing began in Mitterteich. In 1961: SCHOTT decided to extend and modernize Mitterteich as the location for glass tubing production. In 1969: representatives of what is now Schott Glaswerke and the Glaswerke Ruhr AG agreed upon the foundation of Schott-Ruhrglas GmbH. The administration and sales departments of Schott-Ruhrglas were transferred to Bayreuth in 1972 which at that time was the official seat of the company. In 1990: the company was renamed SCHOTT-Rohrglas. In 2001: a new administrative building was put into operation in Mitterteich and the locations Bayreuth and Mitterteich were merged in Mitterteich. Products The company produces glass tubing, rods and profiles from approx. sixty special glass types. The tubing is produced in outside diameters of 0.8 mm to 460 mm in lengths of 0.3 mm to 10 meters. In addition to the classical product ranges, technical tubing (e.g. DURAN) and pharmaceutical tubing (e.g. FIOLAX), backlight glasses and tubing for solar heat (receiver tubes for solar power stations) as well as algae production in tubular photobioreactors are becoming increasingly important. The glass tubing is processed for a variety of applications, for example in pharmaceutics, chemistry, lighting (e.g. halogen lamps, UV lamps), environmental technology or microelectronics.

As Kampung Kerinchi is the original name, used by Indonesian immigrants during British Malaya, he argues that the name should not be changed,https://says.com/my/news/some-netizens-unhappy-over-plans-to- revert-bangsar-south-to-its-old-name-kampung-kerinchi which caused stirred discussion on social media.https://www.msn.com/en- my/news/national/%e2%80%98bangsar-south%e2%80%99-officially-reverts-to-kg- kerinchi-in-win-for-identity-tradition/ar-BBSrmMj?li=BBr8Hnu Bangsar South used to be known as Kampung Kerinchi until the name was changed by the Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur in 2012 to reflect its upgraded image.https://marketingmagazine.com.my/bangsar-south-or-kampung-kerinchi-a- lesson-in-branding/ Kampung Kerinchi name supporters, who consisted mainly of long-time settlers in the area, argued that the name change has been made directly by DBKL and politician in fast track without formal consultation or cooling period from neither new Bangsar South residents and old Kampung Kerinchi residents, and that the name should be kept for the sake of nostalgia.https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2018/05/04/bangsar- south-means-nothing-give-us-back-kerinchi-say-residents/ On the other hand, Bangsar South name supporters; mostly property investors and new owners of Bangsar South property, expressed dismay due to potential loss of investment in the area, as the name change to \\"Bangsar South\\" was part of the successful re-branding that has attract investors.https://www.edgeprop.my/content/1375206/change-bangsar-south-back- kerinchi-irrational-says-estate-agenthttps://says.com/my/news/some-netizens- unhappy-over-plans-to-revert-bangsar-south-to-its-old-name-kampung-kerinchi Others argued that while the name change is encouraged, there are issues such as rising gentrification in the area that needs to be solved first.https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2018/09/10/name- change-can-wait-fix-other-issues-in-bangsar-south-first/ After the general elections, MP Fahmi Fadzil who won the seat for Lembah Pantai, worked with DBKL to re-name the area Bangsar South and the surrounding area as \\"Kampung Kerinchi\\". He has since clarified that this was caused due to a confusion that Bangsar South occupied a larger area, and was re-defined to only refer to the commercial development in the area.https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/01/452932/bangsar-southkampung- kerinchi-issue-was-due-confusion/ References External links  * Official site Category:Suburbs in Kuala Lumpur ","title":"Bangsar South"},{"id":"22762505","text":"Cell polarity is a fundamental feature of many types of cells. Epithelial cells are one example of a polarized cell type, featuring distinct 'apical', 'lateral' and 'basal' plasma membrane domains. Epithelial cells connect to one another via their lateral membranes to form epithelial sheets that line cavities and surfaces throughout the animal body. Each plasma membrane domain has a distinct protein composition, giving them distinct properties and allowing directional transport of molecules across the epithelial sheet. How epithelial cells generate and maintain polarity remains unclear, but certain molecules have been found to play a key role. A variety of molecules are located at the apical membrane, but only a few key molecules act as determinants that are required to maintain the identity of the apical membrane and, thus, epithelial polarity. These molecules are the proteins Cdc42, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), Par6, Par3/Bazooka/ASIP. Crumbs, \\"Stardust\\" and protein at tight junctions (PATJ). These molecules appear to form two distinct complexes: an aPKC-Par3-Par6 \\"aPKC\\" (or \\"Par\\") complex that also interacts with Cdc42; and a Crumbs-Stardust-PATJ \\"Crumbs\\" complex. Of these two complexes, the aPKC complex is the most important for epithelial polarity, being required even when the Crumbs complex is not. Crumbs is the only transmembrane protein in this list and the Crumbs complex serves as an apical cue to keep the aPKC complex apical during complex cellular shape changes. Basolateral membranes In the context of renal tubule physiology, the term basolateral membrane or serosal membrane refers to the cell membrane which is oriented away from the lumen of the tubule, whereas the term luminal membrane or apical membrane refers to the cell membrane which is oriented towards the lumen. The principal function of this basolateral membrane is to take up metabolic waste products into the epithelial cell for disposal into the lumen where it is transported out of the body as urine. A secondary role of the basolateral membrane is to allow the recycling of desirable substrates, such as glucose, that have been rescued from the lumen of the tubule to be secreted into the interstitial fluids. Basal and lateral membranes share common determinants, the proteins LLGL1, DLG1, and SCRIB. These three proteins all localize to the basolateral domain and are essential for basolateral identity and for epithelial polarity. Mechanisms of polarity How epithelial cells polarize is still not fully understood. Some key principles have been proposed to maintain polarity, but the mechanisms behind these principles remain to be discovered. The first principle is positive feedback. In computer models, a molecule that can be either membrane-associated or cytoplasmic can polarize when its association with the membrane is subject to positive feedback: that membrane localization occurs most strongly where the molecule is already most highly concentrated. In similar models, researchers have shown that epithelial cells can self-assemble into a rich set of robust biological shapes. In the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, there is genetic evidence that Cdc42 is subject to positive feedback of this kind and can spontaneously polarize, even in the absence of an external cue. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, Cdc42 is recruited by the aPKC complex and then promotes the apical localization of the aPKC complex in a probable positive feedback loop. Thus, in the absence of Cdc42 or the aPKC complex, apical determinants cannot be maintained at the apical membrane and consequently, apical identity and polarity is lost. The second principle is segregation of polarity determinants. The sharp distinction between apical and baso-lateral domains is maintained by an active mechanism that prevents mixing. The nature of this mechanism is not known, but it clearly depends on the polarity determinants. In the absence of the aPKC complex, the baso-lateral determinants spread into the former apical domain. Conversely, in the absence of any of Lgl, Dlg or Scrib, the apical determinants spread into the former baso-lateral domain. Thus, the two determinants behave as if they exert mutual repulsion upon one another. The third principle is directed exocytosis. Apical membrane proteins are trafficked from the Golgi to the apical, rather than baso-lateral, membrane because apical determinants serve to identify the correct destination for vesicle delivery. A related mechanism is likely to operate for the baso- lateral membranes. The fourth principle is lipid modification. A component of the lipid bilayer, phosphatidyl inositol phosphate (PIP) can be phosphorylated to form PIP2 and PIP3. In some epithelial cells, PIP2 is apically localised while PIP3 is basolaterally localised. In at least one cultured cell line, the MDCK cell, this system is required for epithelial polarity. The relationship between this system and the polarity determinants in animal tissues remains unclear. Basal versus lateral Since basal and lateral membranes share the same determinants, another mechanism must make the difference between the two domains. Cell shape and contacts provide the likely mechanism. Lateral membranes are the site of contact between epithelial cells, whereas basal membranes connect epithelial cells to the basement membrane, an extracellular matrix layer that lies along the basal surface of the epithelium. Certain molecules, such as Integrins, localise specifically to the basal membrane and form connections with the extracellular matrix. Epithelial cell shape Epithelial cells come in a variety of shapes that relate to their function in development or physiology. How epithelial cells adopt particular shapes is poorly understood, but it must involve spatial control of the actin cytoskeleton, which is central to cell shape in all plant cells. Epithelial cadherin  All epithelial cells express the transmembrane adhesion molecule E-cadherin, a cadherin which localises most prominently to the junction between the apical and lateral membranes. The extra-cellular domains of E-cadherin molecules from neighbouring cells bind to one another via a homotypic interaction. The intra-cellular domains of E-cadherin molecules bind to the actin cytoskeleton via the adaptor proteins alpha-catenin and beta- catenin. Thus, E-cadherin forms adherens junctions that connect the actin cytoskeletons of neighbouring cells. Adherens junctions are the primary force- bearing junctions between epithelial cells and are fundamentally important for maintaining epithelial cell shape and for dynamic changes in shape during tissue development. How E-cadherin localizes to the boundary between apical and lateral membranes is not known, but polarized membranes are essential for maintaining E-cadherin at adherens junctions.

History Historic document suggest that the house was originally built in the eighteenth century, with the first recorded mention of ‘Chewton Glen House’ appearing in 1732. Captain Frederick Marryat stayed here for periods in the 1840s, during which time he was writing the novel The Children of the New Forest. Marryat's brother, George, owned the property from 1837 until 1855. In 1947 the house was bought, with the nearby farm, stables and 120 hectares of land, by the Duval (or Devall) family, who restored the old buildings. They converted the property into a hotel in 1962.Steven B. Stern, (2006), Stern's Guide to the Greatest Resorts of the World, page 358 The hotel was sold to Martin Skan and his brother Trevor in 1966. At that time only two rooms had their own bathroom, but within a few years they modernised the hotel with new kitchens, a lounge, a dining room and 45 hotel rooms, each with a private bath. Within ten years the hotel had an international reputation, and the Skans remained proprietors for 40 years. In 2006, Chewton Glen was bought by the property magnate Ian Livingstone.

On May 12, 2009, Pendergest-Holt was indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of a criminal complaint of obstructing a fraud investigation and conspiracy to obstruct justice. In early 2009, Stanford Financial became the subject of several fraud investigations, and on February 17, 2009, Pendergest- Holt was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with fraud and multiple violations of U.S. securities laws for alleged \\"massive ongoing fraud\\" involving $8 billion in certificates of deposit. The FBI raided three of Stanford's offices in Houston, Memphis, and Tupelo, Mississippi. On February 27, 2009, the SEC amended its complaint to describe the alleged fraud as a \\"massive Ponzi scheme\\". On June 21, 2012, she pleaded guilty to obstructing a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Stanford International Bank (SIB), the Antiguan offshore bank owned by Robert Allen Stanford. On September 13, 2012, Holt was sentenced to three years in prison, followed by three years of supervised probation. She was released on April 23, 2015.Inmate Locator, Federal Bureau of Prisons' Regulatory investigation During the week of February 13, 2009, Stanford issued a letter to clients saying: \\"Regulatory officers have visited our offices and have stated that these are routine examinations\\". On February 17, 2009, U.S. federal agents entered the company's Houston and Memphis offices. Law enforcement officials placed signs on the office doors stating that the company was temporarily closed: \\"The company is still in operation but under the management of a receiver\\". The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Pendergest-Holt, Allen Stanford, and James M. Davis of fraud in connection with Stanford Financial Group's US$8 billion certificate of deposit (CD) investment scheme that offered \\"improbable and unsubstantiated high interest rates\\". This led the federal government to freeze the assets of Allen Stanford, Stanford International Bank, Stanford Group Co., and Stanford Capital Management. In addition, Stanford International Bank placed a 60-day moratorium on early redemptions of its CDs. On February 18 and 19, 2009, Ecuador and Peru suspended the operations of local Stanford units, and, in Venezuela and Panama, the governments seized local units of Stanford Bank. Mexico's financial regulator announced on February 19 that it was investigating the local affiliate of Stanford bank for possible violation of banking laws. On February 27, 2009, Pendergest-Holt was arrested by federal agents in connection with the alleged fraud. On that day the SEC said that Stanford and his accomplices operated a \\"massive Ponzi scheme\\", misappropriated billions of investors' money and falsified the Stanford International Bank's records to hide their fraud. \\"Stanford International Bank's financial statements, including its investment income, are fictional,\\" the SEC said.New SEC Complaint Says Stanford Ran Ponzi Scheme, Wall Street Journal, February 27, 2009 Indictment on civil securities fraud complaint The FBI alleges that Pendergest-Holt met with several Stanford corporate officers in Miami in February 2009 to prepare for her testimony with the SEC. The FBI alleges that at the meeting she discussed the Stanford International Bank's Tier III Portfolio and a $1.6 billion loan to a shareholder (Allen Stanford) from the Tier III Portfolio. The portfolio represented about 81 percent of the bank's portfolio. The FBI complaint alleges that when Pendergest-Holt met with SEC investigators she made: > several misrepresentations under oath. Pendergest-Holt also allegedly > misrepresented her own preparatory work for the testimony, saying she had > met with no one other than the attorney as she worked to ready herself for > the session with the SEC. The complaint alleges that she failed to tell investigators during testimony that she was a member of the Stanford International Bank's investment committee or the extent of her knowledge of the bank's Tier III Portfolio. The complaint also says that, during an interview on February 17 with the SEC in Memphis, Tennessee, Pendergest-Holt \\"continued to obstruct the SEC's investigation by saying she had no knowledge of the Tier III Portfolio.\\" Michael Zarich, Stanford's senior investment officer, has told authorities he did not know where ninety percent of Stanford's portfolio was invested. Zarich has said he was trained by Pendergest-Holt to deflect questions about the investment strategy while pitching to wealthy clients in Antigua, where the bank was chartered. When he tried to learn how the money was invested, Zarich has said Pendergest-Holt and Davis turned him away. Zarich also has said Pendergest-Holt armed him with answers for potential investors worried about the size of Stanford's tiny, Antigua-based auditor. Indictment on criminal obstruction of justice complaint On May 12, 2009, Pendergest-Holt was indicted by a Houston federal grand jury on two counts of obstructing a fraud investigation and conspiracy to obstruct justice. She was free on a $300,000 bond. Guilty plea On June 21, 2012, Pendergest-Holt pleaded guilty before federal judge David Hittner to obstructing the SEC's investigation into the Stanford operation. She admitted that despite knowing that she was incapable of testifying about the vast majority of that portfolio, she agreed to testify before the SEC. She acknowledged that her eventual appearance and sworn testimony before the SEC was a stall tactic designed to frustrate the SEC's efforts to obtain important information about SIB's investment portfolio, and that it was an intentional effort to impede the SEC's investigation and help SIB continue operating. Prosecutors offered a deal that allowed her to plead to one count because she did not know about the fraud until early 2009—shortly before its collapse. She admitted that she withheld information about Tier III in order to give the firm \\"time to correct the disclosures, amend them, so we could fall into line.\\"Calkins, Laurel Brubaker. Stanford Ex-Investment Chief Pendergest Holt Gets 3 Years. Bloomberg News, 2012-09-13. On September 13, 2012, she was sentenced to three years in prison and three years of supervised release. Overcome by emotion, she apologized for trusting Stanford. \\"He didn't deserve my trust,\\" she said. \\"And in so trusting, I harmed others.\\" This statement angered prosecutors, who felt she was downplaying the seriousness of her crime. She asked Hittner for permission to self-report to prison in a month so she could arrange for her daughter's care. However, Hittner rejected that request and remanded her to custody immediately.

The fisherman is the trapezoidal sail between the two masts Amazing Grace A fisherman is a sail placed between the fore and main masts of a sailing ship, usually a schooner but also including brigantines. All four of its sides are typically set flying, although the luff may be attached to the mast (possibly with in-mast furling) on a staysail schooner. The purpose of a fisherman is to catch light winds aloft, as it is a large sail set high on the masts. In some rigs, it overlaps other sails and spars such as the gaff of the foresail and therefore must be fully lowered and re-raised at every tack and jibe. Because of this, a fisherman staysail is unusual on a gaff schooner, but on a staysail schooner, the fisherman is a useful way to fill the upper gap between the masts. A staysail is mainly suitable in light to medium airs; in strong winds it does little more than heel the vessel.

In MAXEkSAT, each clause has exactly k literals, each with distinct variables, and is in conjunctive normal form. These are called k-CNF formulas. The problem is to determine the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied by a truth assignment to the variables in the clauses. We say that an algorithm A provides an α-approximation to MAXEkSAT if, for some fixed positive α less than or equal to 1, and every kCNF formula φ, A can find a truth assignment to the variables of φ that will satisfy at least an α-fraction of the maximum number of satisfiable clauses of φ. Because the NP-hard k-SAT problem (for k ≥ 3) is equivalent to determining if the corresponding MAXEkSAT instance has a value equal to the number of clauses, MAXEkSAT must also be NP-hard, meaning that there is no polynomial time algorithm unless P=NP. A natural next question, then, is that of finding approximate solutions: what's the largest real number α < 1 such that some explicit P (complexity) algorithm always finds a solution of size α*OPT, where OPT is the (potentially hard to find) maximizing assignment. Approximation Algorithm There is a simple randomized polynomial-time algorithm that provides a \\\\textstyle(1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k})-approximation to MAXEkSAT: independently set each variable to true with probability , otherwise set it to false. Any given clause c is unsatisfied only if all of its k constituent literals evaluates to false. Because each literal within a clause has a chance of evaluating to true independently of any of the truth value of any of the other literals, the probability that they are all false is \\\\textstyle(\\\\frac{1}{2})^k = \\\\frac{1}{2^k}. Thus, the probability that c is indeed satisfied is \\\\textstyle 1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k}, so the indicator variable \\\\textstyle 1_c (that is 1 if c is true and 0 otherwise) has expectation \\\\textstyle 1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k}. The sum of all of the indicator variables over all \\\\textstyleC clauses is (\\\\textstyle 1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k})C, so by linearity of expectation we satisfy a \\\\textstyle (1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k}) fraction of the clauses in expectation. Because the optimal solution can't satisfy more than all \\\\textstyle C of the clauses, we have that \\\\textstyle ALG = (1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k})\\\\cdot C > (1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k})\\\\cdot OPT, so the algorithm finds a \\\\textstyle \\\\geq (1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k}) approximation to the true optimal solution in expectation. Despite its high expectation, this algorithm may occasionally stumble upon solutions of value lower than the expectation we computed above. However, over a large number of trials, the average fraction of satisfied clauses will tend towards \\\\textstyle (1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k}). This implies two things: # There must exist an assignment satisfying at least a \\\\textstyle (1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k}) fraction of the clauses. If there weren't, we could never attain a value this large on average over a large number of trials. # If we run the algorithm a large number of times, at least half of the trials (in expectation) will satisfy some \\\\textstyle (1-\\\\frac{2}{2^k}) fraction of the clauses. This is because any smaller fraction would bring down the average enough that the algorithm must occasionally satisfy more than 100% of the clauses to get back to its expectation of \\\\textstyle (1-\\\\frac{2}{2^k}), which cannot happen. Extending this using Markov's inequality, at least some \\\\textstyle (\\\\frac{1}{1+2^k\\\\epsilon})-fraction of the trials (in expectation) will satisfy at least an \\\\textstyle (1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k}-\\\\epsilon)-fraction of the clauses. Therefore, for any positive \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon, it takes only a polynomial number of random trials until we expect to find an assignment satisfying at least an \\\\textstyle (1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k}-\\\\epsilon) fraction of the clauses. A more robust analysis (such as that in ) shows that we will, in fact, satisfy at least a \\\\textstyle (1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k})-fraction of the clauses a constant fraction of the time (depending only on k), with no loss of \\\\textstyle \\\\epsilon. Derandomization While the above algorithm is efficient, it's not obvious how to remove its dependence on randomness. Trying out all possible random assignments is equivalent to the naive brute force approach, so may take exponential time. One clever way to derandomize the above in polynomial time relies on work in error correcting codes, satisfying a \\\\textstyle (1-\\\\frac{1}{2^k}) fraction of the clauses in time polynomial in the input size (although the exponent depends on k). We need one definition and two facts to find the algorithm. =Definition= S\\\\subseteq\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n is an ℓ-wise independent source if, for a uniformly chosen random (x1, x2, ..., xn) ∈ S, x1, x2, ..., xn are ℓ-wise independent random variables. =Fact 1= Note that such an assignment can be found among elements of any ℓ-wise independent source over n binary variables. This is easier to see once you realize that an ℓ-wise independent source is really just any set of binary vectors over {0, 1}n with the property that all restrictions of those vectors to ℓ co-ordinates must present the 2ℓ possible binary combinations an equal number of times. =Fact 2= Recall that BCH2,m,d is an [n=2^m, n-1 -\\\\lceil {d-2}/2\\\\rceil m, d]_2 linear code. There exists an ℓ-wise independent source of size O(n^{\\\\lfloor \\\\ell/2 \\\\rfloor}), namely the dual of a BCH2,log n,ℓ+1 code, which is a linear code. Since every BCH code can be presented as a polynomial-time computable restriction of a related Reed Solomon code, which itself is strongly explicit, there is a polynomial-time algorithm for finding such an assignment to the xi's. The proof of fact 2 can be found at Dual of BCH is an independent source. =Outline of the Algorithm= The algorithm works by generating BCH2,log n,ℓ+1, computing its dual (which as a set is an ℓ-wise independent source) and treating each element (codeword) of that source as a truth assignment to the n variables in φ. At least one of them will satisfy at least 1 − 2−ℓ of the clauses of φ, whenever φ is in kCNF form, k = ℓ.

That is, the set of vectors from the input vector space are mapped to an \\\\ell-wise independent source. The proof of this fact below as the following Lemma and Corollary is useful in derandomizing the algorithm for a 1-2^{-\\\\ell}-approximation to MAXEkSAT. Lemma Let C\\\\subseteq F_2^n be a linear code such that C^\\\\perp has distance greater than \\\\ell +1. Then C is an \\\\ell-wise independent source. Proof of lemma It is sufficient to show that given any k \\\\times l matrix M, where k is greater than or equal to l, such that the rank of M is l, for all x\\\\in F_2^k, xM takes every value in F_2^l the same number of times. Since M has rank l, we can write M as two matrices of the same size, M_1 and M_2, where M_1 has rank equal to l. This means that xM can be rewritten as x_1M_1 + x_2M_2 for some x_1 and x_2. If we consider M written with respect to a basis where the first l rows are the identity matrix, then x_1 has zeros wherever M_2 has nonzero rows, and x_2 has zeros wherever M_1 has nonzero rows. Now any value y, where y=xM, can be written as x_1M_1+x_2M_2 for some vectors x_1, x_2. We can rewrite this as: x_1M_1 = y - x_2M_2 Fixing the value of the last k-l coordinates of x_2\\\\in F_2^k (note that there are exactly 2^{k-l} such choices), we can rewrite this equation again as: x_1M_1 = b for some b. Since M_1 has rank equal to l, there is exactly one solution x_1, so the total number of solutions is exactly 2^{k-l}, proving the lemma. Corollary Recall that BCH2,m,d is an [n=2^m, n-1 -\\\\lceil {d-2}/2\\\\rceil m, d]_2 linear code. Let C^\\\\perp be BCH2,log n,ℓ+1. Then C is an \\\\ell-wise independent source of size O(n^{\\\\lfloor \\\\ell/2 \\\\rfloor}). Proof of corollary The dimension d of C is just \\\\lceil{(\\\\ell +1 -2)/{2}}\\\\rceil \\\\log n +1 . So d = \\\\lceil {(\\\\ell -1)}/2\\\\rceil \\\\log n +1 = \\\\lfloor \\\\ell/2 \\\\rfloor \\\\log n +1. So the cardinality of C considered as a set is just 2^{d}=O(n^{\\\\lfloor \\\\ell/2 \\\\rfloor}), proving the Corollary.

Career He was born in Frol, studied under Anders Bratholm and graduated from the University of Oslo with the cand.jur. degree in 1970. He was a research fellow from 1972 to 1978, and took the dr.juris degree in 1978. He has been a professor at the University of Oslo since 1978. He was a guest scholar at Boston University from 1995 to 1996. As of his sixtieth birthday he had penned 35 books and 130 journal articles within the fields of national insurance law, health law, tort law and constitutional law. He chaired the committees that wrote the Norwegian Official Reports 1977:14, 1986:11, 1990:20, 1995:29, 2000:28 and 2004:3. He has been the editor of several law journals. From 1983 to 1984 he headed the Institute of Private Law, and from 1986 to 1988 he was the dean of the Faculty of Law. He also holds an honorary degree from Lund University, and is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In 2009 he publicly supported Trygve Wyller's unsuccessful campaign to become rector of the University of Oslo. Later in 2009 Kjønstad ran for election (among university employees) for a place on the University of Oslo board of directors. He has previously held such a seat from 1986 to 1988 and 1999 to 2001. He has also been a board member of the Anders Jahre Foundation for Scientific Research since 2003 and vice president of the European Institute of Social Security from 1993 to 1997. He died in 2015, aged 72. =Anti-smoking= Kjønstad was a member of the National Council on Smoking and Health, which was incorporated into the Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs in 2002. He has been referred to as the \\"father of the smoking ban\\" in Norway. He has stated that only 5% of his total work has pertained to anti-smoking. =Pensioner scandal= From 2008 to 2009 he chaired a special committee that looked into the so-called pensioner scandal. Retired members of the Norwegian Parliament, whose age and tenure in parliament equalled 75 years or more, were entitled to an especially lucrative pension, nicknamed a \\"golden pension\\". However, it was discovered that some former parliament members had a second income, which was larger than the pension itself. If this were the case, the persons in question were not entitled to the pension. When the committee delivered its report in January 2009, it singled out six former parliament members as suspicious cases: Gro Harlem Brundtland, Kjell Magne Bondevik, Magnus Stangeland, Anders Talleraas, Thor-Eirik Gulbrandsen and Tore Austad. In addition to the issue of pay and income, the committee found that some might have circumvented the 75-year rule by counting years where they, despite being elected as parliament members, actually served as government ministers. Government ministers in Norway may be recruited from Parliament, but while working in the executive branch he or she must leave Parliament, being replaced by a deputy (an element of the separation of powers principle). As such the years which is really spent as government minister can not count towards the specific parliamentary pension, according to Kjønstad. As Kjønstad did not have a mandate to comment on individual cases of guilt, he chiefly blamed the pension regulatory board (composed of other members of parliament) as well as the legislators in general for creating and enforcing the law in a vague way. Already one week after the Kjønstad Committee delivered its report, the pension regulatory board announced its intent to outsource its mandate to the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund. The case was sent to the President of the Storting, and was to be investigated further by the Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime. Also, it was hinted that other people might be investigated. In 2009 the acquittance of Bondevik and Brundtland was announced.

The radio station operates on a Temporary Community Broadcasting Licence, transmitting from studios at the Kings Park complex in Seymour.  History  Seymour FM was established in 2001, under the identity SPI FM. The station was originally intended as a local service for Seymour and nearby Puckapunyal. This service was lacking in key skill areas, and failed to attract the interest of listeners or sponsors, and faltered in 2004 In 2005, a new committee was established to restore a local Seymour based radio service. The new identity of \\"Seymour FM\\" was established, and a series of new presenters commenced programs, along with promotions activity with the revised name and image. Early in 2009, the radio station management took steps to further the radio station objectives to relaunch, and formally apply for a high power full service community broadcasting licence. The radio station in its bid for a full-time permanent licence has proven its ability to successfully operate a long-term community broadcasting service, and has had in this time relocated twice from the former Wimble Street (\\"Bomb Site\\") studios to Emily STreet and finally to the King's Park complex. The radio station's outlook has widened, with original intent to simply cover Seymour and Puckapunyal, the radio station has now the established long-term goal to reach the Northern Mitchell Shire and the Strathbogie Shire. This includes the townships of Seymour, Avenel, Nagambie, Broadford, Pyalong, Tallarook, and Euroa. With the long anticipated new transmission facility and increased transmission power granted to the radio station, these areas will be expected to receive excellent coverage and signal strength. The radio station is also more commonly identifying as \\"103.9 FM\\", with a reducing emphasis on the words \\"Seymour FM\\", as part of the transition to being a higher powered multi township community radio station. Previous Logo until March 2012  Community Radio for the Northern Mitchell Shire & Strathbogie Shire  The proposed new higher power transmission would cover the northern Mitchell Shire and the Strathbogie Shire, in the state of Victoria. This is the area north of the Great Divide. The southern half of the shire is served by Melbourne radio stations; however, the availability of media north of the 'Great Divide' is severely limited, with only scratchy reception from Shepparton (ONE-FM) and Alexandra (UG-FM) based community radio, and the two Shepparton based commercial stations, and ABC. With the limitation of available media choices in the region, the radio station has adopted the \\"Northern Mitchell Shire and Strathbogie Shire\\" as the registered geographic coverage area for its proposed higher power community radio service. Additional coverage into the Strathbogie shire will permit coverage into neighbouring towns such as Avenel and Nagambie with future coverage extending to Euroa and Violet Town. It is anticipated that the station will modify its identity from the present \\"Seymour FM\\" upon the change over to the higher powered TCBL service, to be inclusive of towns within the widened coverage area. The southern section of the Mitchell Shire (including towns such as Kilmore & Wallan) is within the ACMA Melbourne Radio Zone, and is subject to Metropolitan frequency planning. The number of FM radio services in Melbourne exceed 30 and frequencies are unavailable for new services anywhere in the Melbourne Radio Zone. Therefore, Seymour FM has established the northern Mitchell Shire (and part of the Strathbogie Shire) as its designated service area.  Transmitter Site  The transmitter site at an area known as \\"Granite Park\\" provides for coverage to areas including Seymour, Broadford, Avenel, Nagambie, Longwood, Murchison, and southward to Kilmore and Heathcote. The new transmitter site provides the capacity for 4KW output. Previously the transmitter was located in the Seymour township (Emily Street) with coverage limited to Seymour, Tallarook and Puckapunyal. These localities continue to receive good coverage from the new site.  Programs  Seymour FM 103.9 presents a wider number and variety of new programs, including a number of specialist music, community organisation based and sports programs. Programs provide a mix of music and spoken word genre, presented by people resident throughout the coverage area. The program listing is available from the website: Seymour FM Programs  Emergency Situation Broadcasting  Seymour-FM is establishing relationships with the emergency services, mainly the CFA (Country Fire Authority) to provide local information at a time of bushfire. This is also to be promoted as part of the radio station's key local responsibilities. Recent participation in regional emergency broadcasting was in association with neighbouring UG FM, in coverage of the Highlands Grassfire, a fire that burnt its way through over 1800 hectaresof local grassland and bush. With wider coverage via a high powered transmitter, the radio station is seeking to become an emergency broadcaster in its own right. Members from the local community are being encouraged by the management of SeymourFM to participate in emergency broadcast training, and through local council and state government to secure funding for key broadcast linking facilities for use in time of emergency situations  SPORT  Sports coverage includes the Country basketball League matches including the Seymour Blasters basketball team, and coverage of the Goulburn Valley and Kyabram Districts Football Leagues matches featuring the Seymour Avenel and Nagambie teams. Coverage includes home and away fixtures for both competitions.

Sydney Paget served with the British Army in the Second Boer War, achieving the rank of Lieutenant with the machine gun section of the XIIth Yeomanry. His brother, Almeric, married Pauline Payne Whitney, daughter of the enormously wealthy William C. Whitney who hired Sydney Paget to manage his New York Thoroughbred racing stable. Paget ran a ranch at Big Horn, Wyoming for William Whitney where he raised Thoroughbreds on the open range. Among the other top horses Paget was involved with was the filly Hamburg Belle who won the prestigious Belmont Futurity Stakes in 1903. Hamburg Belle was owned by James Ben Ali Haggin but raced in Paget's name. Paget racing stable Near the end of the 1890s, Sydney Paget left the employ of W.C. Whitney to go on his own. In July 1898 he bought Kentucky Derby winner Plaudit from John E. Madden for $25,000. The horse continued to race successfully that year but broke down while training in early 1899 and was retired from racing. Paget sold Plaudit back to Madden for $12,000 who sent him to stand at stud at his Hamburg Place breeding farm near Lexington, Kentucky. In the pre-U.S. Triple Crown era, Sydney Paget owned the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 1898, Jean Bereaud. The colt went on to win the 1899 Belmont Stakes.

Origins  The precise origin of \\"Elliot's eye\\" is somewhat of a mystery. One story is that it is in memory of Captain George Elliot, who, when wounded in the arm in the Crimean War, used the gold on his sleeve as a sling. There are also theories that the Elliott’s eye refers to the method of making an eye in a hemp cable and is said to have been introduced into the Service by the Honourable William Elliot, a member of the Board of Admiralty in 1800 and 1801.  Usage history  Lord Anson’s Board of Admiralty issued the first uniform regulations in 1748 in order to set a distinction between naval and other officers, and lay down precise rules of rank and precedence among naval officers. Distinctive lace on the sleeves of flag officers was introduced in 1783 and was extended to other officers in 1856 with the addition of the curl in the uppermost row of lace for officers of the executive branch only. From 1879 to 1891 Royal Navy officers wore three brass buttons between the lace. In January 1915, the use of the curl was extended to engineer officers and to other officers in 1918. The naval pattern lace was different in that it followed a straight line with a round loop while British Army uniforms were decorated on the sleeve with a loop that rose to a peak in the form of a “crow’s foot” or “Austrian knot”. When the Royal Naval Reserve was formed in 1859 its officers were differentiated from regular officers with rank braid that was half the width and formed two waved lines, one superimposed upon the other with a six-pointed star in place of the curl. In 1903 the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve was instituted and the officers were distinguished with waved stripes worn parallel to each other, surmounted by a squared waved “curl”. Officers of the Women’s Royal Naval Service wore sky-blue lace with a diamond-shaped loop. Although in the Royal Navy the curl is now common to all officers (less those of its associated cadet forces), some other navies who copied the custom have restricted its use to their deck officers. While some navies placed insignia above the braid to indicate specialist branches, Commonwealth navies used coloured cloth beneath the gold lace. Coloured branch distinction, first introduced in 1863, went out of use except for the medical, nursing, medical administration and technical branches, on 31 December 1959\\\\. While 19 of 22 Commonwealth of Nations navies use the executive curl, according to Jane's Fighting Ships 54 of the world's navies use the insignia on officer’s uniform in their naval forces: Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Colombia, Congo (DRC), Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Fiji, Gabon, Ghana, Greece, Iceland, India, Iran, Italy, Jamaica, Kenya, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain (except during the 1931-1939 Spanish Republic), Sri Lanka, Sweden, Thailand, Tonga, Trinidad & Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Venezuela and Vietnam. Those navies that do not use the curl may substitute it with a star, as in the cases of the Chilean Navy, the German Navy, the Russian Navy, the United States Navy, and winter uniforms of the Chinese Navy and the Indonesian Navy; or with other devices, as in the cases of the Finnish Navy, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, the Republic of Korea Navy, and shoulder boards of the French Navy.  Royal Canadian Navy and the executive curl  Prior to 1910, the Royal Navy provided maritime defence of British North America and for the Dominion of Canada from 1867. Early in the 20th century, Great Britain redistributed the British fleet and reduced its stations in Halifax and Esquimalt. As a result, the Government of Canada on May 4, 1910, under the authority of the Naval Services Act, created the Naval Service of Canada. On August 29, 1911 it was designated the Royal Canadian Navy by King George V until in 1968 when Canada’s Navy became Maritime Command within the Canadian Armed Forces. When it was created in 1910 it was natural for the emerging Canadian Navy to adopt the same unwavering rings with the executive curl for the permanent navy and subsequently the “wavy” shaped rings for the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) and the rings of narrow interwoven gold lace for the Royal Canadian Navy Reserve. Sea Cadet Corps officers had a small anchor in place of the executive curl. Following World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy was reorganized with a single reserve component. In 1946 the distinctive wavy gold braid of the reserves gave way to the straight braided executive curl of the regular force until 1968\\\\. With the integration of the Canadian Armed Forces, unembellished straight braid became the common rank insignia for all officers of both the regular and reserve forces. The executive curl rank insignia was reserved for navy mess dress only from 1968 to 2010, and used historical rather than standard rank structures, having both Acting Sub-lieutenants and Sub-lieutenants wear one single bar of rank on the sleeve with the executive curl. On March 5, 2010, the House of Commons unanimously passed a private members' motion recommending, \\"That the government should consider reinstating the navy executive curl on its uniforms.\\" Guy Lauzon, a member of Stormont- Dundas-South Glengarry, explained that the insignia is common to most nations that have a monarch as a head of state. Subsequently, in recognition of the Canadian Naval Centennial, The Honourable Peter MacKay, Minister of National Defence, authorized the use of the executive curl for the Canadian Navy on Battle of Atlantic Sunday, May 2, 2010. After 42 years absent, the executive curl insignia became effective again for service dress uniforms on June 11, 2010, on the occasion of the Pacific Canadian Naval Centennial International Fleet Review parade of nations in Victoria, British Columbia.

It can be described as two poles secured together at the top, forming a thin isosceles triangle. It did not appear until the Old Kingdom, third dynasty, and disappeared after the sixth dynasty when the pole mast took over during the Middle Kingdom. The reason that the bipod mast was used for only a short time is also the reason that it developed in the first place. At the time reed boats were being used to carry goods up and down the Nile. A mast and sail were wanted to make these journeys go more quickly through wind power. The problem was that a pole mast would have to be secured or stepped in the center of the craft, at its weakest point. This would have caused the bottom of the boat to rupture. Because reed materials were not strong enough to support a single pole, the bipod was developed to better distribute the weight. The bipod mast continued to be used even when builders begun using wood to construct boats. It was used both along the Nile and once actual seafaring began. When it was reed materials being used the bipod mast was secured through backstays. Once the builders switched over to wood the two rods were tied to the wood continued to be secured with cables. These bipod masts could easily be stored by folding one side into the other laying it across the ship with its weight evenly distributed on stands also called forked crutches. Thus, the bipod masts were convenient for travel along the Nile. The Nile is easy to travel when heading north, with the current, but when heading south, sailors must use man power and wind power against the current. For this reason the development of the bipod mast was very important. The bipod mast allowed for faster travel south. It is likely that this improved trade because Egyptians did not waste as much time traveling south. Also, the development of the mast was part of the transition into seafaring. In voyaging across the sea a mast and sail are required. So, in conclusion the bipod mast played a major part in ushering in overseas trade.  References  Casson, Lionel. 1971.

The last surviving structure of the C&PA; Railroad, currently used as the borough office. The Coudersport and Port Allegany Railroad was a shortline railroad that operated in Potter and McKean Counties in Pennsylvania in the United States between 1882 and 1964. The original line ran along the Allegheny River between the boroughs of Coudersport, the county seat of Potter County, and Port Allegany in McKean County. The line was originally a narrow gaugeAnnual Report of the Secretary of Internal Affairs of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the year 1887, p. 241 and converted to in 1889. It was prosperous during a lumber boom in the region and expanded east to Ulysses. The lumber boom ended in the early 20th century and the line slowly declined until 1964, when it was purchased by the Wellsville, Addison and Galeton Railroad. The line was finally abandoned in 1970. Today the only surviving building from the railroad is the Coudersport and Port Allegany Railroad Station, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and serves as the town hall for Coudersport today. As of 2009, much of the C&PA; railroad grading can still be found. Railroad bridge abutments exist at Lillibridge Creek in Port Allegany and along the Allegheny River at Coleman Mills, east of Roulette, and east and west of Coudersport. A former caboose used by the C&PA;, displayed near the former depot in Coudersport, PA History Both Potter and McKean Counties were formed from part of Lycoming County on March 26, 1804. Coudersport was settled in 1807 and incorporated as a borough from Eulalia Township in 1848. Coudersport has served as the county seat of Potter County since 1835. Note: This includes Port Allegany was settled in 1815 and incorporated as a borough from Liberty Township on April 4, 1882. The original plan for a railroad along the Allegheny River between Coudersport and Port Allegany was as a part of the Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway (JSPC&B;), which was incorporated on February 17, 1870. The JSPC&B; was originally planned to run from the vicinity of Williamsport west to Jersey Shore, then north up Pine Creek and down the Allegheny River past Coudersport and west to Port Allegany, as part of a larger route to Buffalo, New York. The Panic of 1873 stopped work, although some grading of the proposed line was done in 1874 and 1875. On April 6, 1882 an organizational meeting was held in Olean, NY attended by H.B. Hamlin, F.W. Knox, A.G. Olmstead, A.M. Benton, F.H. Arnold, F.H. Root, C.B. Barse, and C.S. Cary. On May 1, 1882 the C&PA; was chartered. The unfinished JSPC&B; route along the Allegheny River was acquired for $7000 and construction was carried out that summer with the first train reaching Coudersport on September 7, 1882. The gauge Coudersport and Port Allegany Railroad unofficially opened the next day with the formal opening occurring on September 26, 1882. The original line between Coudersport and Port Allegany was initially operated with two steam locomotives. Both locomotives were built by the Brooks Locomotive Works. Engine number one was purchased from the Olean, Bradford & Warren for $3000. Engine number two was purchased from Brooks for $8250 on November 29, 1882. There was a connection with the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad at Port Allegany, and a Ramsey Car Transfer Apparatus was added there in 1883 so that lumber from mills on the line could be more easily loaded onto cars. In 1887 a locomotive was added, and in July the next year the stockholders voted to convert the line to , which was done on June 16, 1889. Note: This includes A subsidiary of the railroad built an extension southeast along Mill Creek to the village of Sweden Valley in Sweden Township in Potter County. By 1895 a new line was extended northeast along the Allegheny River east to Newfield Junction in Ulysses Township, Pennsylvania, where it connected with the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad, and then on to a new eastern terminus at the borough of Ulysses, where it linked with the Fall Brook Railway. The Fall Brook became part of the New York Central Railroad system in 1899, and a year later the western terminus at Port Allegany connected with the Pennsylvania Railroad, so the Coudersport and Port Allegany Railroad connected the two major rail lines in that part of Pennsylvania. The Coudersport and Port Allegany Railroad began construction on a new brick and sandston station in Coudersport in 1899 and opened it in January 1900. Coudersport's population grew from 1,525 in 1890 to 3,217 in 1900, and this was also when the lumber industry was at its height. The lumber industry declined soon after, and in 1924 the line from Newfield Junction to Ulysses was abandoned. The western of the line to Port Allegany were destroyed in a July 18, 1942 flood and the railroad connected to other lines only through Newfield Junction after this. In 1964 the railroad was purchased by the Wellsville, Addison and Galeton Railroad, which finally abandoned it on December 8, 1970. The borough of Coudersport bought the station in 1975 and restored it, adding a new roof. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 21, 1976. As of 2009 it serves as the police station and office building for the borough government of Coudersport, and is the only remaining building from the Coudersport and Port Allegany Railroad.

The first church on this site was built in 939, when Odo of Cluny was given the Roman palace of Alberic II of Spoleto, which was then converted into a Cluniac Benedictine monastery. When the monastery was dissolved in the 14th-century, the site was acquired by the Knights of Malta, who had the church rebuilt in the 1550s. In 1760, the papal nephew and Grand Prior of the Knights, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Rezzonico, sought to improve the appearance of the buildings. On a limited budget, the church was substantially renovated between 1764-66 according to the designs of Giovanni Battista Piranesi. It is his only architectural work. According to a 2019 account, he \\"consolidated the structure of the 16th-century church and raised the side walls...restored the vault and designed the decoration for its new aspect\\". Piranesi also designed the piazza in front of the church, the Piazza dei Cavaliere di Malta. The fairly low wall around the piazza is articulated by panels with paired obelisks with stelae positioned between them. The church facade has paired fluted pilasters towards its edges to infer a temple front. The vertical linearity of the fluted pilasters act as a foil to enhance the more decorative reliefs of the facade. The reliefs on this facade, the entrance gate and the panels and stellae in the piazza include emblems and other references to the military and naval associations of the Knights of Malta and the Rezzonico family heraldry. The way in which they are represented indicates Piranesi's fascination with Rome's ancient past as they allude to motifs from Ancient Rome and Etruria. Piranesi's decoration of the church interior culminates in the very sculptural main altar. The church contains Piranesi's tomb and that of Bartolomeo Carafa (died 1405) designed by Paolo Romano. The Grand Priory of Rome (a division Knights of Malta) with support from the Fondazione Roma finances the restoration of both the interior and exterior that lasted from 2015 to 2019.

The document is divided in 3 separate parts that covers: SI for digital broadcasting systems (Part 1); Data structure and definition of SI basic Information (Part 2); and Syntax and definition of SI extended information (Part 3). The standard was written by telecommunications and television experts from many countries with their works coordinated by the SBTVD Forum and cover in detail all the aspects of video and audio coding that applies to SBTVD. The complete document can be found and downloaded freely in English, Spanish and Portuguese at ABNT's website. Introduction The multiplexing and SI aspects of the Brazilian Digital Terrestrial Television Standards are described in the three documents published by ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas),ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas) the ABNT NBR 15603-1:2007 - Digital terrestrial television - Multiplexing and service information (SI) - Part 1 SI for digital broadcasting systems; ABNT NBR 15603-2:2007 - Digital terrestrial television - Multiplexing and service information (SI) - Part 2: Data structure and definition of SI basic Information; and ABNT NBR 15603-3:2007 - Digital terrestrial television - Multiplexing and service information (SI) - Part 3: Syntax and definition of SI extended information. The multiplexing and SI standard is very similar to ARIBARIB Association of Radio Industries and Businesses equivalent keeping the data structure but with modified values for the parental control descriptor, genres and subgenres. The customized descriptor values reflect Brazilian laws, policies and culture. Document technical overview This document specified set of tables for the Service Information is based on ARIB STD-B10 with the addition of the AVC and AAC descriptors, according to ETSI EN 300 468. This standard specifies the basic configuration of service information used in digital broadcasting, detailed data structures of this service information, and operational guidelines. Service information consists of signals that complement the transmission control signals and program specific information as defined in MPEG-2 systems. It is provided to convey multiplexed program data to a receiver and to simplify program selection. The multiplexed-signal formats (PES packet, section format, TS packet, composition of the transmission control signal, composition of descriptors, composition of identifiers, and composition of related information are thoroughly listed. The specification is intended to allow a wide range of applications and to integrate detailed data structures and usage guidelines with the basic configuration. The service information was specified under the preconditions of international compatibility in data structures, flexibility in accommodating various program configurations from different broadcasters, and extendibility with respect to future broadcast services. The multiplexing and SI standard is very similar to ARIB equivalent keeping the data structure but with modified values for the parental control descriptor, genres and subgenres. The customized descriptor values reflect Brazilian laws, policies and culture. These documents are also officially available at ABNT website. Summary The multiplexing and SI requirements established for the Brazilian digital television standards make use of the same fundamental systems that also exist in the Japanese digital television standards as can be seen on ARIB STD-B10. The three volumes of the multiplexing and SI standards are described in detail in documents: ABNT NBR 15603-1:2007 - Digital terrestrial television - Multiplexing and service information (SI) - Part 1 SI for digital broadcasting systems; ABNT NBR 15603-2:2007 - Digital terrestrial television - Multiplexing and service information (SI) - Part 2: Data structure and definition of SI basic Information; and ABNT NBR 15603-3:2007 - Digital terrestrial television - Multiplexing and service information (SI) - Part 3: Syntax and definition of SI extended information.

Download / Play / Watch Digital locker services often come with integrated client software that allows users to play the movies or games or songs. Upload Many digital locker services enable users to upload their own content or provide synchronization software that will scan a user's computer and upload the appropriate media for them. Matching Some services like Google Play and iTunes will match songs users have to a digital signature, allowing them to skip the sometimes slow process of uploading the media file. Rather, once the song is matched, it will just be added to a user's library. Digital rights management Digital lockers are often used as a way of controlling access to media via Digital Rights Management (DRM). Services such as Steam, Origin, Blizzard, Vudu, and others offer to users the convenience of a digital locker in exchange for the control of DRM.

Digital Micromirror Devices  → See main article digital micromirror device Digital Micromirror Devices (DMD) were invented by Texas Instruments in 1987 and are the core of the DLP technology used for video projection. The mirrors are arranged in a matrix and have two states, \\"on\\" or \\"off\\" (digital). In the on state, light from the projector bulb is reflected into the lens making the pixel appear bright on the screen. In the off state, the light is directed elsewhere (usually onto a heatsink), making the pixel appear dark. Colours could be produced by various technologies like different light sources or gratings.  Light Deflection and Control  The mirrors could not only be switched between two states, their rotation is in fact continuous. This could be used for controlling the intensity and direction of incident light. One future application is controlling the light in buildings, based on micromirrors between the two panes of Insulated glazing. The power and direction of the incident light is determined by the mirrors state, which itself is controlled electrostatically.Viereck, V., Ackermann, J., Li, Q., Jakel, A., Schmid, J. and Hillmer, H., Sun glasses for buildings based on micro mirror arrays: Technology, control by networked sensors and scaling potential, Networked Sensing Systems, 2008.

The battle was one of the Chinese Civil War in the immediate post World War II era, and resulted in communist victory. Prelude Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also rooted from the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realised that his nationalist regime simply had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to deploy his troops into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Unwilling to let the communists who had already dominated most of the rural regions in China to further expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender and thus would consequently control the Japanese occupied regions, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the communists and kept their fighting capabilities to “maintain order” in the Japanese occupied regions, fighting off the communists as necessary, until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the nationalist troops. As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regimes and their military forces rejoined the nationalists. However, most of these former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime forces were not from Chiang Kai-shek’s own clique, but instead, they were mainly consisted of troops of warlords who were only nominally under the Chiang Kai-shek’s before World War II, since they were nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independent and semi-independent status. These warlords were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet regimes once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists to gain more territories by holding on to what was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over. Chiang Kai-shek’s objective was to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, which proved to be an extremely fatal mistake for him and his nationalist regime later on, as shown in this conflict. Nationalist strategy In accordance with his strategy to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers had hoped that these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords who rejoined the nationalists would be able to hold on to the regions long enough for Chiang to deploy his own troops by holding off communists. If the communists were victorious in such conflicts, however, the result would still benefit to Chiang and China because the power of these warlords would be reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, and the warlord problem plagued China for so long could thus be greatly reduced, while at the same time, communists would be weakened by the fights and Chiang's own troops would have easier time to take control. For the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces, these warlords and their troops had no problem of following Chiang Kai-shek’s orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. These warlords and their troops were well aware that due to the collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were well hated by the general population in China, including those nationalists who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory. Therefore, in the impending demilitarisation after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which would probably be the best outcome and the power of these warlord would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result. Chiang Kai-shek’s ordering them not surrendering to the communists and fighting off the communists was a savior for them because by carrying out such orders, these warlords and their troops could legitimise themselves and thus retain their power by fighting the communists who were targeted as rebels by Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. communist Strategy The communist strategy was much simpler than that of the nationalists because there was not any huge division within the communist rank like that of the nationalist. The communists already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after the nationalist withdrew, and after successfully establishing communist bases in the rural regions where better life was provided to the general populace in comparison to that of Japanese occupied regions, the general Chinese populace agreed that the communists were well deserved to represent the China to accept the invaders’ surrender in the region and takeover the regions occupied by the invaders. Campaign Lishi was an important transportation hub in Shanxi. In, 1945, the communist decided to take town by force after the local defenders consisted of former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime force who rejoined the nationalists after World War II refused to surrender. Japanese troops previously stationed in Lishi had already withdrew to Fenyang in late August 1945, and the city was subsequently besieged by the communists, thus preventing them from reinforce Lishi. Additionally, Wenshui (文水) and Liulin (柳林) were both taken by communists in late August, thus any hope of nationalist reinforcement was gone. However, the local garrison of the isolated town was not afraid because the city wall was tall and thick, and the defenders were confident that they could hold out with huge supplies stored inside the town. The communist 8th Regiment was assigned to take the town and reached its destination at 3:00 am on 6 September 1945 and an hour later, launched its assault on the town. After two hours of fierce fighting, all nationalist position outside the city wall was taken and after the communists had consolidated their gains, they launched their attack on the town itself at 9:00 pm. However, heavy rain prevented the attackers from manoeuvring and flood forced the attackers to call off its first assault. After the flood had subsided, a second assault was attempted at 8:00 am on September 7, but it was successfully repelled by the defenders. After thorough preparation, communist attackers launched a third assault at 1:00 am on 9 September 1945 and succeeded in breaching the defence. At 5:00 am and 6:00 AN on September 9, the 8th Company and the 7th Company of the communist 8th Regiment successfully established their respective strongholds on the top of the city wall, and pushed toward the inside of the town. The communist 9th Company and Special Company soon followed their comrades, and the 1st Battalion and the 2nd Battalion of communist 8th Regiment also entered the town afterward. With enemy breaching the defence and pushed into the town for street fighting, defenders realised that everything was over. At 7:30 am, over a hundred defenders broke out via southern gate of the town and attempted to escape to Zhongyang (中阳), but they did not reach far: when they reached Mamao Village (马茂庄), they were ambushed and completely annihilated by the 4th Company of the communist 8th Regiment and the communist Youth Company. By 8:00 am, the remaining defenders in the town were completely annihilated. The surviving nationalists stationed in the three strongholds near the town subsequently surrendered to the communists, who obtained these positions without a fight, and the battle ended with communist victory. The communist victory meant that in addition to Lishi, strongholds near the town including Dawu (大武), Shangluqiao (上芦桥), and Zhangzishan (张子山) also fell into communist hands, and the communists succeeded in killing 304 nationalists, capturing 1,104 alive, and capturing 456 guns, 34 light machine guns, 1 heavy machine gun, and large amount of supplies stored in the town. Outcome Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek’s attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together proved to be a fatal mistake. Although the result of the campaign turned out exactly like Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates had predicted, and consequently the power of the warlords in this region was indeed reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, so that the warlord problem plagued China for so long was thus reduced for this particular region, and Chiang Kai- shek’s secondary objective was achieved here, any positive gains obtained by the nationalists were negated by the politic fallout. The reason was that this success of achieving the secondary objective came at a huge cost in nationalists’ loss of popular support in this region formerly dominated by the Japanese, because the local population had already blamed nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders, while reassigning these former Japanese puppet regime forces as the nationalist forces to fight the communists, the only Chinese force left in the regions, only further alienated the local populace and strengthened the popular resentment to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. The communists did not have the dilemmas faced by the nationalists and enjoyed popular support, and thus was able to easily overwhelm their nationalist adversary, and thus achieving victory without much difficulty. Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, the political gain was much greater than the military one for the communists as result of this battle.

The correct answers to the quiz stated that the Earth is not billions of years old, that dinosaurs did not live millions of years ago, that God created dinosaurs on the 6th day and included several additional questions regarding Bible content. Diana Baker, BRCA Administrator, stated that she did not feel anything wrong was done and that the teacher will not be disciplined. Ken Ham, President of Answers in Genesis, stated on his blog that the quiz was based on a DVD produced by his organization. Closure Blue Ridge Christian Academy announced that it would not be open for the 2013-2014 school year due to lack of funding. The school had sought $200,000 to remain open, but had only received $15,000 in donations. On August 8, 2013, a public sale was scheduled by the school to sell its curricula, books, teacher resources, office supplies, school supplies, toys and bulletin board materials.

It's essential for the correct implementation by manufacturers of either fixed, mobile or portable receivers aimed at the Brazilian Digital TV market. The standard was written by telecommunications and television experts from many countries with their works coordinated by the SBTVD Forum and cover in detail all the aspects of video and audio coding that applies to SBTVD. The complete document can be found and downloaded freely in English, Spanish and Portuguese at ABNT's website. Introduction The receiver configuration aspects of the Brazilian Digital Terrestrial Television Standards are described in a document published by ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas),ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas) the ABNT NBR 15604:2007 - Digital terrestrial television – Receivers. The receiver standardization document elaborates on the common requirements and optional features that might be available on the receiver side of the digital television communication. Providing a common ground work for the expected behavior of devices under a common set of rules. Document technical overview SBTVD Basic receiver configuration The Brazilian technical standard for digital television concerns specifications of receivers for digital broadcasting, and specifies, in particular, minimum basic functions and essential requirements to satisfy initial needs for the deployment of digital terrestrial television broadcasting. The standard does not cover features which affect the quality of the displayed picture or application rather than whether receiver is able to decode pictures at all. Such issues are left to the marketplace. Wherever practical the Brazilian standard suggests implementations that ignore reserved and private information and allows for future compatible extensions to the bit-stream. In order to maintain user habit, Brazilians have defined a code to keep, in the digital format, the same channel numbers used in analogue broadcasting, thus making it possible to have an analogue to digital transition with maximum transparency. The code is called virtual channel numbering. These documents are also officially available at ABNT website. Summary The requirements established for receivers in the Brazilian digital television standard allow for a variety of receiver models with many possible combinations of optional features, while maintaining the basic common required features expected for high quality of service. The ABNT NBR 15604:2007 - Digital terrestrial television – Receivers describes in detail the required and optional features for the system on the receiver side.

The painting The painting may have been the last of Raphael's Florentine paintings before he left for Rome. It is more complex than a similar painting the Small Cowper Madonna of a few years earlier. The Virgin and Child fill the canvas, creating an imposing effect. The two are more closely related, both by positioning of their bodies and their intimacy. Raphael may have derived the talent for creating a natural intimacy through Leonardo da Vinci. The portrayal of the infant's energy is reminiscent of works of Michelangelo.

Mirko Kovats (born 3 August 1948) is an Austrian investor mainly known for his role as founder, majority owner (indirectly, through his private foundation known as \\"MUST\\") and chairman of the Austrian Traded Index listed company A-TEC Industries, one of the largest industrial groups in Austria. He has been cited as a representative example of a businessman in Austria who places shareholder value above all else.  Biography  Private life = Kovats was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1948 as the son of Hungarian immigrants. He studied Commercial Sciences at the University of World Trade and gained a doctorate at the age of 23 years. He is married and has two sons. = Early operation (until 1997) = After graduation Kovats worked in the 1980s as a dealer in machines with the Comecon countries. After the 1989 collapse of the Soviet bloc, he entered a new field of employment, developing office and hotel projects and investing in real estate. In the 1990s Kovats participated, together with his partner Dr. Mock, in several nightclubs (including U4 in Vienna, A2 South Pole in Vösendorf, and Tanzpalast in Baden, Vienna-Wight Work, Dorian Gray in Korneuburg). = Establishment of A-TEC = From the end of the 1990s Kovats began building his group A-TEC Industries. He laid the foundation in 1997 by acquiring 50% of the shares in the Salzburg machine tool factory Emco. This was later followed by other main pillars of the group: ATB Austria Antriebstechnik, Montanwerke Brixlegg and Austrian Energy & Environment. Through acquisitions Kovats continuously expanded his industrial holding company. Mostly he buys economically struggling companies with high \\"turnaround potential\\" at a reasonable price, and succeeds within a few years to reorganize and make a profit. Once, more than 70 companies with more than 10000 employees are in the group which has a turnover of well over 1 billion euros. The insolvency of A-TEC in 2010 was one of the biggest in Austria's postwar history. = Cupori = In 2015, Kovats acquired the French copper producer KME via his company Cupori Oy of Finland. This move saved 214 jobs in France. = Bahamas = Kovats was also a bidder for the South Ocean resort in New Providence, Bahamas. He owns a home in Lyford Cay, Bahamas.  Criticism  Due to his unconventional business practices and methods of financing and his sometimes spectacular transactions Kovats has repeatedly been accused of risky, unfair or even criminal activity. In the early phase of his business operations (before 1997) numerous companies in which Kovats was directly or indirectly involved in became insolvent. The Austrian investigative journalist Hans Pretterebner announced in 2007 that he was writing a book on economic crime in which a chapter is devoted to Kovats's career and especially the aforementioned insolvencies. Multiple Kovats has been sued under civil law. Also, he has been criminally indicted twice: #In 2000 the Vienna High Court sentenced Kovats to six months' probation for offenses in connection with the bankruptcy of the nightclub \\"Dorian Gray\\". #In July 2007, the Vienna public prosecutor's office announced that it was starting proceedings against Kovats for fraud in connection with the insolvency of the nightclub \\"A2 south pole\\". If convicted he is threatened with a prison sentence as a repeat offender. The trial began on 17 September 2007. Small investors accuse Kovats damaging the reputation of A-TEC and harming its stock price by his business practices. They call for more transparency. A-TEC shares stood at €100 in December 2006 and in October 2008 reached a historic low of €7.81. The 2008 documentary Let's Make Money by Erwin Wagenhofer shows him making highly controversial statements about industrial relations in his Indian factories.

Description Sitting in the center of the work in a bright red dress is the Madonna. She is fair skinned with blonde hair. She sits comfortably on a wooden bench. Across her lap is a dark drapery upon which her right hand delicately sits. There appears to be a sheer translucent ribbon elegantly flowing across the top of her dress and behind her head. The faintest golden halo miraculously surrounds her head. In her left hand she holds the baby Christ, who embraces her with one arm around her back, the other around her neck. He, an undeniably precious child, looks back over his shoulder with a coy smile. Behind them, a beautifully clear and bright day unfolds. Off in the distance two figures appear to be ambling toward a reflective pond, enjoying the green scenery around them. A large and very impressing structure stands at the end of a long path, which one could presume to be a Catholic church. Its dome and other structural elements common of Catholic architecture add to the already omnipresent atmosphere of religious divinity and grace. 2015 Exhibition In 2015 the National Gallery of Art loaned the Small Cowper Madonna to the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts (U.S.) to be exhibited alongside The Virgin and Child (The Northbrook Madonna).

The $1,000,000 in gold bullion was in fact lost in a modern-day quake and is part of an insurance fraud by Trevor. He does not want the divers to find the gold and will stop at nothing to ensure the success of his plan.

It's a detailed reference for manufacturers and content providers that aim to coordinate transmission and reception protection systems in a transparent and effective way for mass viewing. The standard was written by telecommunications and television experts from many countries with their works coordinated by the SBTVD Forum and cover in detail all the aspects of video and audio coding that applies to SBTVD. The complete document can be found and downloaded freely in English, Spanish and Portuguese at ABNT's website. Introduction The security aspects of the Brazilian Digital Terrestrial Television Standards are described in a document published by ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas),ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas) the ABNT NBR 15605:2008 – Digital terrestrial television – Security issues – Copy control. The standard addresses the topic of protection of the transmitted content against its inappropriate and unauthorized use through the use of communication protected protocols and interfaces. The document also elaborates on the security aspects required for applications transmitted over the air and access to specific portions of a receivers hardware. Document technical overview In order to protect the contents of digital terrestrial television broadcasting, the standard defines rules regarding interfaces and recording media. This means the content protection information transmitted by broadcasting stations shall be reflected on all the interfaces between receiver units and peripheral equipment. Internationally available copy- protection tools are defined for the digital video output, audio output and high-speed interfaces. All digital outputs (e.g.: HDMI, DVI, etc.) shall be protected by HDCP and DTCP. Additionally the resolution of the analogue video output must be limited to 350.000 pixels, equivalent to standard definition, whenever a copy protection signaling is transmitted. Defined implementation criteria ensure receiver units to be designed and manufactures in such a way that acts of defeating or bypassing the function requirements are effectively prevented. These documents are also officially available at ABNT website. Summary The requirements established for security in the Brazilian digital television standard are in line with the current set of technical protection measures commonly used worldwide for security of free-to-air high definition content. The ABNT NBR 15605:2008 – Digital terrestrial television – Security issues – Copy control describes in detail the required security features and limitations that must be applied on the receivers side in order to allow for protection against unauthorized use of information and content.

It was founded in 1974.  Certified Manager  The Institute of Certified Professional Managers (ICPM) sponsors the professional Certified Manager (CM) certification. Through a comprehensive program of management and leadership development and assessment, the CM certification validates managerial competency and leadership potential. The CM certification program comprises application, training and assessment. CM applicants meet eligibility requirements for education and experience to receive approval to pursue the CM certification. Training on the comprehensive CM body of knowledge comprises 75–90 hours and can be completed in groups, as classroom training, or individually, as self-directed study. A job task analysis performed periodically confirms the knowledge, skills and abilities and forms the basis of the CM body of knowledge. Applicants control the pace of program completion within 15 months. The CM certification is obtained by meeting eligibility requirements and passing three CM exams. Certificants can use the “CM” professional credential after their name, e.g. John Smith, CM. Certificants complete professional development activities annually and pay a professional fee ($50) to maintain current CM status.  History  The Institute of Certified Professional Managers (ICPM) was established in 1974 through a grant from the George R. Brown Foundation. The Institute was formed to enhance recognition of management as a profession and to provide direction in the study of management. Two organizations founded ICPM: the International Management Council (IMC) and the National Management Association (NMA). The International Management Council (IMC) was founded in 1903 by foremen who were members of YMCA. Initially, named the Industrial Management Club, its mission was to train line managers for jobs in manufacturing. IMC chapters were formed in over 40 US states and internationally in Taipei, Taiwan and Japan. In 1971, the organization’s name was changed to the International Management Council and its membership expanded to include company presidents, managers and first line supervisors. In 2003, IMC merged with the National Management Association. The National Management Association (NMA) was founded in 1925 by Mr. Charles F. Kettering, a pioneer in human resource development. Initially named the National Association of Foreman, today it goes by \\"NMA . . . THE Leadership Development Organization\\" to reflect its focus on leadership development. NMA is a national, non-profit leadership development organization headquartered in Dayton, Ohio with a membership of over 22,000.

Sheppard (born December 2, 1940 in Ashwell, Hertfordshire, England) is an English Hall of Fame trainer in American Thoroughbred horse racing. Sheppard came to the United States in 1961 and in 1966 won his first race with Haffaday in a steeplechase event at My Lady's Manor, Maryland. In 1973 he won his first earnings championship in steeplechase racing. He went on to win the earnings title another twenty-three times. He has trained the winner of four Breeders' Cup Grand National Steeplechase and holds the record for most wins in the Colonial Cup Steeplechase with eleven. Sheppard is the only trainer to win the American steeplechase Triple Crown, doing it with Flatterer, the only horse to win the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Steeplechase horse four years in a row. In addition to steeplechase racing, Sheppard has met with considerable success in flat racing. In both venues, he has had a long working relationship with stable owner, George W. Strawbridge Jr., and in 2008 he conditioned Strawbridge's filly Forever Together to victory in the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. In 1990, he was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. In 2004, Sheppard was elected president of the National Steeplechase Association. In 2008, Sheppard joined fellow Hall of Famee inductee Sidney Watters, Jr. as the only men in American racing to have trained a champion over both jumps and on the flat. As of 2010, Sheppard's horses have won twelve Eclipse Awards: * Athenian Idol (1973) * Cafe Prince (1977, 1978) * Martie's Anger (1979) * Flatterer (1983, 1984, 1985, 1986) * Jimmy Lorenzo (1988) * Highland Bud (1989) * Forever Together (2008) * Informed Decision (2009) * Divine Fortune (2013) Leading US steeplechase trainer of all time in victories and earnings  On September 25, 2010, he achieved the milestone of getting his 1,000th steeplechase victory as a trainer. At Monmouth Park Racetrack his trainee Arcadius took the $100,000 Helen Haskell Sampson Stake (NSA-G1) by a length under Brian Crowley. He became the first trainer to send out 1,000 jump winners in the United States. The milestone is considered all the more impressive with the low annual volume of National Steeplechase Association sanctioned races. In 2008, for example, there were a total of only 168 jump races held that year in the US. On October 29, 2011 (with the victory of the runner 'Dugan' at the Aiken Fall Races) Sheppard's career winnings in National Steeplechase Association races rose by $9,000 (USD) to $20,002,192. The British-born trainer is the first in the American sport ever to pass the $20-million mark, unadjusted for inflation. His closest competitor, Jack Fisher, has yet to hit the $10,000,000 mark. Noted flat achievement milestone accomplished with victories Jonathan Sheppard achieved his 3,000th win as a flat trainer Monday September 17, 2012, when Fugitive Angel won the seventh race at Delaware Park in Stanton, Delaware. Sheppard became the 28th trainer in North American racing history to hit the milestone. The 5-year-old horse was bred and is owned by longtime client George Strawbridge Jr. and his Augustin Stables. Saratoga Race Course achievements Sheppard has won at least one race in every annual [Saratoga Race Course] meet since 1969 through and including 2015, 47 years, which is a record streak for any trainer. His 1st 2015 Race Meet victory was scored by Lune de Caro (TX) in a steeplechase race August 18, 2015. Jonathan remarked to the Times Union, \\"“I said if I didn’t win one (at Saratoga) this year, I wouldn’t come back” His winning streak of a win every summer at Saratoga ended with the 2015 meet. No trips to the winner's circle for Sheppard at Saratoga for the 2016 meet and thus ending the streek at 47. He was the leading Saratoga trainer in 1984 and 1985.

The data coding aspects of the Brazilian Digital Terrestrial Television Standards are described in the following documents published by ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas):ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas) ABNT NBR 15606-1:2007 - Digital terrestrial television - Data coding and transmission specification - Part 1: Data coding; ABNT NBR 15606-2:2007 - Digital terrestrial television - Data coding and transmission specification - Part 2: Ginga-NCL for fixed and mobile receivers: XML application language for application coding; ABNT NBR 15606-3:2007- Digital terrestrial television - Data coding and transmission specification - Part 3: Data transmission specifications for digital broadcasting; and ABNT NBR 15606-5:2008 - Digital terrestrial television - Data coding and transmission specification – Part 5: GingaGinga organization Brazilian website in English -NCLNCL - Nested Context Language for portable receivers: XML application language for application coding. The standard was written by telecommunications and television experts from many countries with their works coordinated by the SBTVD Forum and cover in detail all the aspects of video and audio coding that applies to SBTVD. The complete document can be found and downloaded freely in English, Spanish and Portuguese at ABNT's website. The standard addresses one of the main advances regarding the middleware specification, one of the Brazilian digital television system. The middleware specification comprises a procedural portion, performed by Java,Sun Microsystems - Sun Microsystems And SBTVD Forum To Develop Open-Source Java Solution For Brazil's Digital TV System and a declarative portion, performed by NCL and Lua, with a bridge that allow for mutual access between them. The combined Brazilian middleware specification is called Ginga. Document technical overview SBTVD middleware structure Brazil will have a unique joint implementation of declarative and procedural middleware and the bridge between them. The Brazilian data coding system is called Ginga and comprises the language specification used by the presentation engine Ginga-NCL, the monomidia coding and GEM compliant Java presentation engine. The lower level protocol is the data carrousel for transmission of a data block without any kind of semantics. On the upper level the object carrousel allows the transmission of file, archives, applications, folders and event synchronization. Object carrousel is not part of the Japanese ARIB standards, but rather defined on DVB and ATSC standards. SBTVD middleware structure NCL, Nested Context Language, is a XML application language recommendation that allows authors to write interactive multimedia presentations in a very simple and efficient manner. Using NCL, an author can describe the temporal behavior of a multimedia presentation, associate hyperlinks (user interaction) with media objects, define alternatives for presentation (adaptation), and describe the layout of the presentation on multiple devices. Unlike HTML or XHTML, NCL has a stricter separation between content and structure and provides non- invasive control of presentation linking and layout. Therefore, NCL does not define any media itself. Instead, it defines the glue that holds media together in multimedia presentations. The procedural part defines a generic interface between interactive digital applications and the terminals on which those applications are executed. It enables digital content providers to address all types of terminals ranging from low-end to high-end receivers with flexibility and portability. The specification also includes a special profile for portable reception. These documents are also officially available at ABNT website. Summary The performance levels for the Ginga middleware exceeds the current levels achieved by similar systems by using smaller and more efficient script languages, like Lua. Also, the combination of a procedural and declarative programming languages in one single system allow for the creating of a greater set of applications with minimum effort to the programmer. The transmission of interactive application within free-to-air programming will improve broadcasters relationship with its audience. The documents describing the reference specification of Ginga are ABNT NBR 15606-1:2007 - Digital terrestrial television - Data coding and transmission specification - Part 1: Data coding; ABNT NBR 15606-2:2007 - Digital terrestrial television - Data coding and transmission specification - Part 2: Ginga-NCL for fixed and mobile receivers: XML application language for application coding; ABNT NBR 15606-3:2007- Digital terrestrial television - Data coding and transmission specification - Part 3: Data transmission specifications for digital broadcasting; and ABNT NBR 15606-5:2008 - Digital terrestrial television - Data coding and transmission specification – Part 5: Ginga-NCL for portable receivers: XML application language for application coding.

The Cypress Cabin was purchased by the Zimmernam Estate represented by Zimmerman, Saxe and MacBride, Chicago architects. It was planned to move the house to St. Joseph, Michigan, where it was to be a summer home near the Bolton exhibit building of the 1893 Columbian Exposition. The move included the Cabin, Guest House and other landscape elements. That move never happened and Robert Bartlett trucked the Cabin and Guest House to Beverly Shores.Daily News, November 3, 1934Collins, Judith E; et. al; Cypress Log Cabin, Guest House, Beverly Shores-Century of Progress Architectural District; Historic American Buildings Survey, National Park Service, Washington, DC; HABS IN-241-A, HABS IND 64-BEVSH, 2A; 1994 Bartlett owned the property until 1942, when sold it to Ida J. Osterburg. The house changed owners several times, until it was purchased by the National Park Service in October 1970, becoming part of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The Cypress Log Cabin was built for the 1933-34 exhibition house to demonstrate the many uses of cypress. The house was built using traditional materials rather than the experimental materials used elsewhere in the exhibition.Collins, Judith E; et. al; Cypress Log Cabin, Beverly Shores-Century of Progress Architectural District; Historic American Buildings Survey, National Park Service, Washington, DC; HABS IN-241-A, HABS IND 64-BEVSH, 2A; 1994 During both seasons of the fair, Mr. and Mrs. B.R. Ellis from the Southern Cypress Association lived in the ell of the house. Century of Progress Interior of the Cypress Log House The Guest House was added to the Home and Industrial Arts Group for the 1934 exposition year. It was used as a display building showing historic uses of cypress, such as a 150-year-old Seminole Indian canoe, 200-year-old Spanish prison stock and a 120-year-old French water main from New Orleans . The Guest House was one of several changes in the Home and Industrial Arts Group landscape for the 1934 season. Move to Indiana In the winter and spring of 1934, sixteen buildings barged and trucked to Robert Bartlett's subdivision at Beverly Shores, Indiana. In an attempt to capitalize on the fairs success, Bartlett reestablished a small exhibition of model houses along Lake Front Drive in Beverly Shores. Depression-era America had responded the Chicago Century of Progress exhibition and Bartlett hoped to transfer that positive interest to his development. The Cypress Log Cabin was moved to Lake Front Drive in Beverly Shores along with four other houses from the Home and Industrial Arts Group. The exhibition site had been landscaped by the James W. Owen Nurseries. Robert Bartlett planned \\"to reconstruct and landscape them for sale exactly as they were on the Fair grounds.\\" Bartlett neither replicated the fair landscape nor did adapted individual themes for each house. The by grouping the house along Lake Front Drive, Bartlett managed to recreate a sense of an \\"exhibition group\\". Three of the exhibition homes were lined up on the south side of Lake Front atop a dune. A retaining wall was created to run the length of Lake Front from the Armco-Ferro House, past the House of Tomorrow to the Cypress Log Cabin. A flight of twenty-seven stairs in front of each house leads to the yard in front of each house with a walkway connecting all three. Log Cabin Cypress Log Cabin Floor Plan The house is an intentionally rustic mountain cabin set in a picturesque, asymmetrical landscape. In contrast to many of the model houses that featured modern building materials, the Cypress House was intended to exhibit the diverse possibilities for building with a traditional material. The house was meant to be a display space rather than a model home arranged to look as if someone lived there. Ironically, the Cypress House was the only building in the Home and Industrial Arts group that actually served as a home; the ell was occupied for both seasons by the house's sponsor and his wife. The Cypress House had a complex landscape scheme formed from an assemblage of fences, arbors, bridges and decorated cypress knees used to create a mountain lodge atmosphere. For the 1933 season of the fair, the only major outbuilding was a greenhouse built by Lord & Burnham. For the 1934 season, the Southern Cypress Association applied for additional land in the former Dahlia Garden to construct a second greenhouse by Lord & Burnham's main competitor, the American Moninger Company. This request was denied and the most of the Dahlia Garden land was given to the Kohler company. The Lord & Burnham greenhouse was removed for the 1934 season and a new building was built that extended slightly into the Dahlia Garden. This may have been the Guest House, then functioning as a cypress workshop. Guest House Guest House floor planAn outbuilding of the Cypress Log Cabin, the Guest House was originally a part of the Home and Industrial Arts Group at the 1933-34 Chicago Century of Progress Exposition. The structure was moved to Beverly Shores, Indiana by Robert Bartlett, a real-estate developer who purchased the houses after the close of the fair Cypress Log Cabin - Guest House =Exterior= Characterized as a rustic style mountain lodge, the house is on concrete footings. The walls are made of pecky cypress log siding. The building is of frame construction with log and ship-lap siding. Porches were added when the buildings were moved to Beverly Shores. =Interior= The house is a long narrow, single room width rectangle. The living spaces are arranged in a symmetrical pattern around of a central living space. Entering the central living space from the north, the kitchen is to the right or east with a bedroom beyond it. To the left or west are two bedrooms and a bathroom. At the far west end of the structure is a utility room accessible only from the outside Restoration efforts Restoration efforts on the Cyprus Log Cabin were started in 1997. The home is now fully restored and occupied by long-term renters who obtained a 30-year lease from the park service in exchange for restoration and maintenance of the home.

Honey is seen in some variations of the sandwich. The sandwich is frequently cooked in a pan or on a griddle. The recipe for the sandwich has been published in numerous cookbooks and newspaper stories. It is sold commercially in restaurants that specialize in peanut butter sandwiches, such as Peanut Butter & Co. Elvis Presley and the sandwich The peanut butter and banana sandwich has been referred to as a favorite of Elvis Presley, who was renowned for his food cravings such as the Fool's Gold Loaf, a loaf of French white bread filled with a pound each of bacon, peanut butter, and grape jelly. Books on Elvis Presley's favorite foods and culinary tastes, as well as other published reports on his taste for peanut butter and banana sandwiches with or without bacon, have made the sandwich widely associated with Presley. It is often referred to using his name. Presley's fondness for peanut butter and banana sandwiches is well established; however, bacon is not mentioned in all accounts.Examples of the sandwich sans bacon are easily found; gossip columnist Liz Smith provides one: A book about Presley and his mother, Gladys Presley, though, says he had \\"sandwich after sandwich of his favorite—peanut butter, sliced bananas, and crisp bacon\\". Another passage describes him talking \\"feverishly until dawn\\" while \\"wolfing\\" down the sandwiches (described in this instance as being made with mashed banana). A news report suggests that, based on renditions of sandwiches named after him, Presley ate his with caramelized bananas and crispy bacon on grilled Hawaiian bread, and grilled by his mother or his cook in bacon fat. The Good, the Bad, and the Yummy describes it as consisting of half a banana and a piece of bacon per sandwich, browning the sandwiches in a frying pan with butter, cutting the sandwiches into wedges, and piling them high. Variants The sandwich has had numerous variations, many of which were billed as \\"Elvis Presley's\\" or owing to \\"Elvis\\" himself. Nigella Lawson of the cooking show Nigella Bites featured \\"Elvis Presley's Fried Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich\\" in a 2007 episode that was made of white bread, butter, a banana, and peanut butter. Another cooking show \\"Sara's Secrets\\" featured \\"The Elvis\\" with the Peanut Butter & Co.s recipe, which includes 8 slices of bread, butter, a banana, peanut butter, 12 slices of bacon and honey. A variant on the sandwich is the peanut butter banana club sandwich, which combines the sandwich with a club sandwich by adding lettuce, brown sugar and lemon juice. Another version of the sandwich was sold under the name The Memphis at the \\"all peanut butter sandwich\\" restaurant P.B. Loco prior to the company going out of business, which added honey and substituted bacon bits for bacon strips. The sandwich has also been featured in a cookbook for canines in The Everything Cooking for Dogs Book. The book suggests alternative fillings including sweet potato, carrots, pumpkin, and apples.

The play takes place every July in a natural bowl amphitheater found in the Drumheller Valley, less than 10 minutes from downtown. The unique outdoor location was chosen for the topographical similarity to the Israeli countryside surrounding Jerusalem, as well as the superb natural acoustics. It follows the story of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus found in the Gospels, told through drama and music, using over 200 volunteer performers and professional theatre crew. The script is rewritten often to tell the story from a fresh perspective. Each year, more than 10,000 audience members travel to Drumheller for the Badlands Passion Play, an area already known for tourist attractions like the Canadian Badlands and the Royal Tyrell Museum. History In 1988 the founder of the Rosebud Theatre and Rosebud School of the Arts, Laverne Erickson, formed a steering committee and began gaining the support of local community organizations for what would become the Canadian Badlands Passion Play. The charter meeting for the establishment of a passion play was held in 1990, and thus was born the Canadian Badlands Passion Play Society. The Honourable Gordon Taylor, Former Minister of Highways for Alberta and Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Drumheller Riding, was presented with the title of honorary chairman for the society. During the 1960s, Mr. Taylor had put forth efforts in Drumheller to produce a passion play for the area, but the project was never started due to several factors. 233x233px The society set Summer 1994 as its goal for the first production of the show. of land were obtained, in addition to another owned in conjunction with the Drumheller Valley Ski Hill. In July of that year, the Canadian Badlands Passion Play held its premiere performance, filling the 1150 available seats. The original playwright, Kathy Covert, directed the show. The next years saw the introduction of many changes and upgrades, including an increase in seating, the building of a choir loft, expansion of the set, and various script changes. Regional choir rehearsals occurred throughout Alberta and Saskatchewan. 1998 saw the Society's first Winter Choir Concert Series in Lethbridge, Calgary, and Red Deer. In the year 2001, the Jerusalem Wall Project opened its first phase. The project meant to replicate on a smaller scale the actual Jerusalem Wall in Israel. The Jerusalem Wall through the years has housed many services including a black box theatre and interpretive museum, but is currently home to a concession, gift shop, wardrobe, armoury, production offices, and a rehearsal space. 2003 introduced a variety of small scale dramatic performances on the site, although this initiative lasted only three years. In 2006, partly in response to declining ticket sales, the production was completely updated with a new script based on the Gospel According to Matthew, by Royal Sproule, and new music by Bill Hamm. Auditions were held province-wide, the musical instrumentation was expanded, and a character was added as a narrator to help the audience follow changes of time and location in the storyline. 2011 marked the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Passion Play and its 100th performance on the outdoor stage. It was commemorated with a heritage coffee table book with photographs that focus on the past five years of performances. Playwright Royal Sproule wrote a new script that focused on retelling the life of Christ through the eyes of the Apostle John. The choir moved from the Choir Loft to joining the actors on stage, and the play ran for seven nights instead of six. The Passion Play also debuted a new sound reinforcement system for its 2011 performances. This three-dimensional sound system enhances the audiences' audio experience, and strategically places sound (both voice and music) to keep the audience engaged as the visual action unfolds in front them. This modification not only assists those who have difficulty hearing, but also allows the entire audience to feel more like they are a part of the action. In 2011 the Passion Play was also the subject of an award-winning documentary by Philip Spink and Zuzana Novak. In 2013, the Passion Play was awarded the Alto \\"Pride of Alberta\\" award from Alberta Tourism. In 2014, the American Bus Association named the Canadian Badlands Passion Play one of the top 100 events in North America. In 2015, the Chambers of Conference of Alberta presented the Passion Play with the Award of Distinction in Arts and Culture. Other awards included the 2015 Alberta Tourism Marketing Award, and the 2015 Alberta Tourism Collaborative Marketing Award. In 2016, a new script was adapted from the Gospel of Luke by Barrett Hileman, and directed by Brian Jensen. The Society Mandate The purpose of the Canadian Badlands Passion Play is to: 1\\\\. Portray the life of Jesus 2\\\\. Increase awareness and skill in the arts 3\\\\. Unify our community around common projects and encourage tourism by creating significant cultural attractions Tag-lines for the Passion Play have included \\"An authentic experience with the life of Jesus Christ\\", \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\", and \\"An epic story of Faith, Hope, and Love\\". The Performance Jesus, John and Peter Celebrate at a party given by Matthew Although the details of the script often change from year to year, the story usually spans 3 hours and is not limited to portraying only the final hours of Christ (the traditional \\"Passion of the Christ\\"). Unlike many Passion Plays around the world, the Badlands Passion Play also dramatizes the life, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus. Action occurs on every viewable space, including the set, the hills, and the audience area. The performance occurs in nearly any weather, with the exception of weather that threatens the safety of viewers or performers. =Music= Musical underscoring is a powerful element of the show. The play is infused with choral and instrumental music, as well as onstage singing and playing by cast members. The original choir pulled from English and Hebrew religious texts, as well as providing a dramatic vocalise style underscoring some scenes on stage. From 2006 to 2011, the music was written by Bill Hamm, a professor at Rosebud School of the Arts, and central figure in the Rosebud Theatre. This music shifted away from the chorale style and single electric keyboard of the prior script, and expanded to include trumpets, euphonium, tuba, timpani and other percussion, and other instruments. Portions of the music were drawn from Hebrew folksongs, and one piece in particular from Antonio Vivaldi's Gloria. Others were inspired by the Classical canon of composers, such as Mozart. Some of the music was based on modal textures, such as the Phrygian dominant scale (also known as Ahava Rabboh, Freygish, Hijaz maqam, or Jewish Scale) which is constructed by raising the third note of the Phrygian modal scale. In 2011, Luke Ertman became the composer and developed an epic score for the Gospel of John (2010–2015) and the Gospel of Luke (2016–present). This music plays much like a film score, heightening drama and enhancing the overall artistry. =Performers= The body of performers is drawn from a pool of musicians and actors from across Alberta, and in some cases reaching into Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and even Ontario. It is composed mainly of volunteer amateur actors and musicians, however also involves a few notable professionals, such as actors from Canadian Actor's Equity Association and ACTRA. Although the cast size fluctuates from year to year, the average number of performers each year is around 200 people of all ages.Music and Dance is a big part of the play =Wardrobe= Costumers in the Wardrobe department extensively research authentic first century garb in the Middle East. It was unlawful to have a graven image for the Jewish people of that time, and so there are little to no pictorial resources which can be drawn upon in the way of statues and engravings. Much of the wardrobe is therefore based upon text descriptions by historians, and the customs and culture of present-day Orthodox Jews. Much is also drawn from studying the wardrobe and culture of the Bedouins, who have changed relatively little over the centuries. Many performers have multiple roles, and therefore multiple costumers, demanding a vast archive of costume pieces. Here John the Baptist speaks to King Herod from a hill =Nature's Special Effects= A large part of the draw of an outdoor theatrical experience is the surrounding nature. Shows have been highlighted by sunsets, eagles, seagulls, gophers, wind, light rain, and timely cloud breaks. Even windstorms and rainstorms are known to enhance the experience of viewers. =Narrator= With the introduction of the Matthew script in 2006, the convention of a Narrator was also added. A narrator gives the story a personal perspective, allowing the audience to see what the world may have been like through the eyes of one of a disciple or traditional writer of one of the gospel accounts. A narrator character also helps the audience follow changes in time and place. Previous narrators have included Matthew the Evangelist, John the Apostle, and Mary Magdalene. Script Evolution It is a challenge to make characters that can be connected to = Original Script (1994-1996) = The original script used for the show was written by Kathy Covert, who also wrote a portion of the lyrics for the music. This script was used for two years. = Gospel of John by Randall Wiebe (1996-2005) = In 1996, Randall Wiebe wrote a new script, based primarily on the Gospel of John. New music and lyrics were written by the Society founder, Laverne Erickson. The script was used for another 11 years, with annual edits and updates in order to keep the show fresh. Scenes were added and deleted according to playwright and director tastes. Over time a marketplace developed, taking place behind the main action, from which characters could be drawn for certain scenes. = The Gospel According to Matthew (2006-2010) = In 2006, partly in response to declining ticket sales, as well as a desire for a fresher production, a new script was written by Royal Sproule (with excerpts taken with permission from Murray Watts' \\"Miracle Maker\\"), and music was written by Bill Hamm, both of whom are quite prominent in the Rosebud Theatre community. The new script saw a move away from the marketplace backdrop and other crowd-oriented scenes, in favour of developing individual relationships within the story. With such a large cast, the crowd almost functioned as its own character within the choreography of the show. This revitalized script gave an increased artistic approach to the story. The concept was to employ theatrical techniques to make the story more powerful and engaging, while remaining true to the history of the story. Allusions were made to Shakespeare's Henry V, most significantly, the opening speech delivered by Matthew, which is derived largely from the Chorus' introduction. Several surrealistic and symbolic theatre techniques were employed. The script also deepened the humanity of the characters, particularly the disciples and female followers, and explored their relationships and interactions with one another. = The Gospel of John by Royal Sproule (2011-2015) = 2011 launched a new, fast-paced, action-oriented telling of the Gospel of John. Rich with colour and pageantry, followers of Jesus wore blue that matched the sky above the Passion Play. Playwright and director, Royal Sproule, warned that while Matthew was an easy story to digest, John doesn't pull any punches. With noticeably more violence and an epic new score, this version of the Passion Play was cinematic in feel and scope. Stage The Passion Play stage is placed within a natural bowl amphitheatre in the hills of the Badlands known as the Badlands Amphitheatre. The space encompasses 2700 seats, as well as a 300-seat choir loft, although the recent addition of a musicians' platform has decreased this number slightly. The stage itself has undergone massive upgrades over the years. It currently holds a large set building that serves both as a backstage and as a prop storage during the off-season. A large cement paddock is at the front of the building marking areas known as the \\"temple\\" and the \\"marketplace\\". . Some aspects of the stage were used during the 11-year run of the old script, before the 2006 change, largely as part of the marketplace backdrop. After the script change was made and the marketplace was no longer used as such, staging no longer required some of these stage areas, and they become largely a part of the atmosphere of the play, rather than a part of the show directly. The front of the stage is marked by a large wooden dock, representing the coast of Lake Gennesaret (or the Sea of Galilee) and other bodies of water. Carved into one hill are stairs leading up to \\"Calvary\\", and at its base lie tombs which are used at various points in the production. in 2019, an orchestra house was added onto the right side of the stage. The entire area is used in the production, including the surrounding hillside. The Summer Theatre Project The Summer Theatre Project was an initiative started in 2003 to extend the Passion Play site as a summer-long cultural attraction. The project ran for 3 years and included family shows, contemporary productions, and solo performances based on biblical stories. In 2012, a small amphitheatre with 300 seats was completed on the Passion Play site. The Forum Theatre continues to be used by performers, musician, and community organizations. Planned Advancements Several upgrades are planned for the show and the production site. The remaining phases of the Jerusalem Wall Project (the first of which was completed in 2001), will see the renovation of the current phase, as well as an extension from the current wall to the set building allowing for transport of props, actors, and storage materials. Further improvements to an animal holding area used during the production run were completed to accommodate the live animals used in the show. Renovations to office spaces to increase efficiency and staff comfort. A Roman Road campaign has been launched, and will see the paving of a period style road designed for the ease of visitors, and actors during the show. Seating was expanded and in 2010 the website featured for the first time an online ticketing system where patrons can even choose the seat they'd like if booked early. Improvements and repairs were made to the set and set buildings as well. In 2011 the implementation of a $100,000 three dimensional surround sound system to enhance the audiences' audio experiences and accommodate those with difficulty hearing.

The term is generally applied to a line of sheep bred from a single affected lamb born in 1791 in Massachusetts, USA. The breed was artificially selected and maintained for its desirable inability to jump over fences. It was allowed to go extinct in 1876 when it was no longer required. The name \\"Ancon\\" has also been applied to other strains of sheep arising from individuals with the same phenotype, such as a Norwegian stock bred from a single individual born in 1919, and a Texan, USA stock bred from a single individual born in 1962. These lineages were also allowed to go extinct after scientists no longer needed them for genetic research. Excavations in Leicester, UK have also revealed metacarpals, metatarsals and phalanges characteristic of Ancon sheep that date to approximately AD 1500, thereby demonstrating that the phenotype has arisen independently at least four times. The unique features of ancon sheep are caused by a recessive dwarf mutation, which often results in crippling. The specific effect of the mutation is to cause chondrodystrophy. Significance to the history of biology Despite the Ancon's small numbers the sheep's contribution to the history of biology has been substantial. Several chapters in Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species references the Ancon as an example of his argument that offspring inherit independent characteristics from their parents. The notion is perhaps best understood by the claim it denounced: the long-held belief among naturalists and breeders that inherited traits were a \\"blending\\" of the traits of each parent. If that were true, the offspring of an Ancon and a common sheep would have a height between those of the parents. Instead, the resulting offspring were either Ancon or common, thus supporting Darwin's contention. Darwin's review of the Ancon sheep helped lead to the establishment of an early consensus view of the sheep's role in understanding biology. Darwin referred to the Ancon as a \\"sport\\", or a new species or breed born suddenly from a prior species (as a form of phylogenetic variation, not to be confused with the \\"sporting plant\\" referred to in the study of botany) as opposed to a new species developing gradually over a long period of time through the natural selection of multiple traits. Darwin believed that this was possible because the Ancon sheep was born and bred in captivity. In his 1868 work The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, Darwin argued that sudden mutations such as the Ancon are rare to non-existent outside of captivity. In his view, species change through the mutation and natural selection of minor traits which, when added up over time, gradually establish new species. Later scholars supporting Darwin's view also pointed out that the Ancon sheep had essentially a single trait - their short legs - which also made rapid mutation unusually likely, since other species and breeds are set apart from their progenitors by many traits.

History It was built beginning in 1930, to house the expanded offices of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Construction was completed on the U.S. Department of Agriculture Administration Building to the north of Independence Avenue in 1930, but Depression-era agriculture programs demanded far more office space than the main building could provide. The phased construction was completed in 1936. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Completed in 1936, the South Building was the largest office building in the world until the completion of the Pentagon, with dimensions of by in seven stories with 4500 rooms. The building's design is credited to Louis A. Simon of the Federal Office of the Supervising Architect. The South Building was joined to the Administration Building by two enclosed pedestrian bridges spanning Independence Avenue, thus consolidating USDA operations into one complex. The new building contained laboratory space as well as offices. It was originally referred to as the \\"Extensible Building\\", which could be expanded in a phased fashion. Phasing was necessary due to the time required to acquire such a large parcel of land. Edwin Morris relief panels on the windows at the rear of the building, facing C Street The architecture of the South Building is a stripped-down example of Classicism, with plain detailing that borrows from Classical form and proportion without using a great deal of expensive and time-consuming detail. The style became popular for government buildings until the advent of the Modern style in government architecture, reaching its apex at the Pentagon. In the case of the South Building, the lesser level of detail indicated its subordinate position vis-à-vis the Administration Building. The interior is based on a rigidly- enforced network of corridors; only the departmental auditorium and library deviate from the corridor grid. Interiors are even more plain than the exterior. The building is arranged in seven north-south wings, connected at the ends by the Headhouse (facing Independence Avenue) and Tailhouse (facing C Street). The 12th and 14th Street elevations were planned to be seen from the National Mall and so were sheathed in limestone. The C Street and Independence Avenue elevations, which are not visible from the National Mall, used brick as the primary material, with limestone and terra cotta detailing. The 14th Street elevation also features a monumental entrance with sixteen Corinthian columns. Elsewhere, relief panels between windows feature depictions of animals native to the United States by sculptor Edwin Morris. Since the relocation of laboratory space to the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, the South Building has been occupied exclusively by offices.

Active Minds was founded by Alison Malmon in 2003, after her older brother died by suicide in 2000. There are now more than 500 chapters, made up of both national and international high schools and colleges. History Alison Malmon launched the first student-led chapter of what would become Active Minds in her junior year at the University of Pennsylvania, after her older brother, Brian, died by suicide. Brian Malmon appeared to be a successful student at Columbia University, he was a member of the Dean's list, and was a leader in many extracurricular activities. However, he was suffering from what was later diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder, and was keeping those feelings to himself. After his death, many friends claimed that they had noticed changes in Brian, but were not sure what to say or how to approach the situation, and therefore did nothing. This silence and lack of awareness is what prompted Malmon to start Active Minds. The organization, originally called \\"Open Minds\\", was dedicated to increasing awareness about mental illness. In 2003, when Malmon graduated, she launched Active Minds, Inc as a 501(c)(3) organization. She became the youngest person to receive the Tipper Gore Remember the Children Award from the National Mental Health Association. National programs Although Active Minds is focused on peer-to-peer education and local student-run chapters, the organization hosts several national programs as well. = Send Silence Packing = A local Active Minds chapter hosting Send Silence Packing In 2008, Active Minds held the first Send Silence Packing display at the National Mall in Washington DC. The display consists of over 1,000 backpacks laid on the ground in a public space, with personal stories attached. These backpacks represent the lives of 1,100 college students that are lost to suicide each year. = PostSecretU = This program is similar to PostSecret by Frank Warren, but available exclusively through Active Minds for colleges and universities. It allows students to share secrets anonymously through postcards. These postcards are then shown in a visual art display. = Stress Less Week = The Active Minds Stress Less Week is a community-based stress relief and awareness program that seeks to curb the ever-increasing trend of stress among college students. The Active Minds website provides a Stress Less Resource Kit with ideas for programming. = National Day Without Stigma = Occurs on the Monday in October that coincides with Mental Health Awareness Week. On this day, Active Minds encourages students on college campuses to engage in programming like chalking support messages, crushing soda cans, and reaching out to anyone who may be struggling.  Other initiatives and awards  Active Minds Speakers = A set of 12 speakers travel around the country and speak to audiences about their experiences with mental health. The speakers typically do about 100 speeches a year and go through intense training before being added to the roster. = National Conference = The first National Conference took place in 2004, and the two-day conference has been held every year since. Young adults and mental health leaders gather to discuss ideas and develop new knowledge and ideas. = Emerging Scholars Fellowship = A six-month fellowship is awarded to students annually by Active Minds, to further their work on mental health projects. Each student selected receives $1,000, which is funded by the Scattergood Foundation. = Healthy Campus Award = This award is given to colleges and universities that are pioneering student health initiatives that prioritize both mental and physical health. It was established in 2016 and is supported by Peg's Foundation.  Impact studies  California college impact study = A study done across 12 California colleges found that increased awareness of Active Minds led to an increase in perceived knowledge about mental health related issues and in helping behaviors. It also led to a decrease in stigma. This study had limitations, however, as it was done on a convenience sample, so the students involved may have been more involved in Active Minds than an average student. = Healthy Minds Study = Another study included 70,000 students at colleges that participated in a Healthy Minds Survey. In this study, Active Minds was found to lower the stigma felt (both on a personal and public level), increase knowledge about resources and services, improve attitudes toward medications, and lower levels of depression and anxiety. The study did suggest, however, that Active Minds may not have an increasing effect on already positive mental health. This study was limited by its large sample size, which made significant results more likely. Kridel, M., McDermott, Ryon C., Dempster, Darleen, & Smith, Phillip. (2016).

T. A. Hoffmann and several of his friends. The Serapion Brethren also is the title of a four-volume collection of Hoffmann's novellas and fairytales that appeared in 1819, 1820, and 1821. E. T. A. Hoffmann The literary circleSeraphin Brethren= In 1814, Hoffmann returned to Berlin from Dresden and Leipzig, where he had been working as an orchestra conductor and opera director, to return to work as a Prussian civil servant. In that year, he and a group of friends formed an association for the purpose of reading from and discussing works of literature (primarily their own). The group first met on October 12, which happened to be the feast day of Saint Seraphin of Montegranaro. The friends therefore decided to refer to their group as an “order” and to give it the name The Seraphin Brethren [Die Seraphinenbrüder]. After about two years of gatherings at Hoffmann's home or the Café Manderlee on the famous boulevard Unter den Linden, the circle gradually dissolved, partly, it is thought, because of the departure of one of its members, Adelbert von Chamisso, for a sailing trip around the world with the Russian Rurik Expedition, which had been organized to find a Northwest Passage (Kremer, 1999, 165). =Serapion Brethren= On November 13, 1818, Hoffmann's publisher gave him a sizable advance on the publication of a multivolume collection of his novellas and fairytales. To celebrate this happy event (Hoffmann was quite impecunious at the time), the author invited his friends from the old Seraphin Brethren to his home on November 14 for the purpose of celebrating the advance and reviving the literary group. Another reason for celebration was the return of Chamisso from his travels. Hoffmann's wife Micha brought the calendar, and the date was seen to be the feast day of Saint Serapion. Accordingly, the old order was rechristened The Serapion Brethren (Die Serapionsbrüder) (the Catholic list of saints [see “Catholic Online” at WWW.catholic.org]) shows eleven Saint Serapions; the one after which the group was named was probably Saint Serapion the Sindonite, a fourth-century Egyptian hermit and monk) (Kaiser 1988, 64; Pikulik 2004, 135). Aldelbert von Chamisso The Serapion Brethren included the following members: *Hoffmann's lifelong friend and occasional benefactor Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel *Hoffmann's colleague in the civil service and first biographer Julius Eduard Hitzig *Poet Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué *Novelist Adelbert von Chamisso *Dramatist, novelist, and merchant Karl Wilhelm Salice-Contessa *Prussian military officer Friedrich von Pfuel *Physician David Ferdinand Koreff *Theologian Johann Georg Seegemund Others participated from time to time in the group's meetings as guests. The book title In February 1818, the Berlin publisher Georg Reimer offered to publish a compilation of Hoffmann's previously published but scattered novellas and fairytales. Hoffmann suggested uniting the disparate works by presenting them in a fictional framework of readings and conversations among a group of friends in the manner of Ludwig Tieck’s Phantastus (Kremer 1999, 164) (and, although Hoffmann did not say this, in the manner of Giovanni Boccaccio’s The Decameron, albeit in an urban rather than a pastoral setting). For the collection, Hoffmann first suggested to Reimer the title The Seraphin Brethren. Collected Novellas and Fairytales, after the old literary group. Once the group was reconstituted, however, Hoffmann dropped the subtitle and called the compilation simply The Serapion Brethren (Segebrecht 2001, 1213). In eight meetings, the friends in the fictional framework narrative, Ottmar, Theodor, Lothar, Cyprian, Vinzenz, and Sylvester, orally present a total of 28 stories (only 19 have titles) and comment in some detail on their quality and on whether or not they adhere to a certain “Serapion Principle” that becomes clear to the reader as the narrative progresses. Attempts have been made, especially in older scholarly works, to assign the names of some of the real Serapion Brethren to the fictitious ones. Ellinger (1925, 40), for example, sees Ottmar, Theodor, Sylvester, and Vinzenz, as Hitzig, Hoffmann, Contessa, and Koreff, respectively. In reality, of course, all the narrators are Hoffmann himself, who, after all, was writing fiction (Steinecke 1997, 115). References Ellinger G., editor. E.T.A.

Plot summary Cass Silver (Robert Ryan), marshal of a small Kansas town, is expecting trouble with the arrival of the first Texas trail herds on the newly completed railroad. The town’s new saloon owner, Honest John Barrett (Robert Middleton) is anticipating an increase in business; he and Silver have negative history between them and Barrett wants rid of the marshal. To make matters worse, the marshal's deputy, Thad Anderson (Jeffrey Hunter), formerly one of the trail cowboys, is the son of a gunfighter Cass shot years before, in another town. Thad wants to avenge this death; he has always believed his father was unarmed when Silver shot him. Eventually, Thad realizes the truth and helps the marshal restore law and order to the town.

ORE Catapult's head office is in Glasgow, Scotland. The centre operates multi-purpose offshore renewable energy test and demonstration facilities. It is similar to other centres, such as NREL in the UShttp://www.narec.co.uk and National Centre for Renewable Energies (CENER) in Spain. The National Renewable Energy Centre is based in Blyth, Northumberland. History Originally known as NaREC (New and Renewable Energy Centre), the centre was created in 2002 by One NorthEast, the North East regional development agency, as part of the Strategy for Success programme.http://www.strategyforsuccess.info/page/news/article.cfm?articleId=1400 In 2010 the organisation changed its name to Narec (National Renewable Energy Centre). In April 2014, the organisation merged with the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult to focus on the development and cost reduction of offshore wind, wave and tidal energy across the UK. The organisation was originally involved in a wide range of technologies, including: * Wind (onshore and offshore) * Transmission and distribution * Photovoltaics * Oil and gas * Marine renewables * Fuel cells * Microrenewables * Biomass In 2010, due to UK government cutbacks, Narec closed, sold off or separated parts of the business. Now, Narec itself concentrates on testing blades and drive trains for marine renewables. Spin-off companies include: Narec Distributed Energy – An organisation which deals with energy efficiency, solar farm design, preparation of MW scale battery sites, grid connection, and Life Cycle Assessment. Narec Distributed Energy is 10% owned by ORE Catapult. Solar Capture Technologies – A completely independent company which specialises on bespoke and novel solar photovoltaic systems, including off grid systems. Narec Capital – A financial organisation run by Narec and Ashberg Limited. Narec Capital Risk Solutions – Beyond its existence, there is very little information on what this organisation does. Following its merger with ORE Catapult, the National Renewable Energy Centre now focuses on helping to de- risk and accelerate the development and commercialisation of the offshore renewable energy industry in the UK. Operations The National Renewable Energy Centre is involved in: =Wind turbine rotor blades = Product certification, verification and investigations for the next generation offshore wind turbines.http://www.onenortheast.com/page/news/article.cfm?articleId=4863http://www.wig.co.uk/NAREC =Power trains and components = 3MW and 15MW facilities that can perform independent performance and reliability assessments of full systems and components. =Electrical networks= UKAS accredited laboratories with specialist test and measurement facilities to help develop technologies needed for developing power systems and exploring life extension opportunities for ageing assets. = Subsea trials and demonstrations = Controlled onshore salt water location for all stages of technology development. =Resource measurement and assessment= Open access facility for testing, calibrating and verifying remote sensor technologies Closed facilitiesClothier High Voltage Laboratory= The Clothier Electrical Testing Laboratory was opened in 1970 by A.

Narec took over the facility in 2004, to use it to test the robustness of electrical infrastructure offshore locations to onshore sites.http://www.nebusiness.co.uk/business-news/latest- business-news/2010/05/13/narec-in-advanced-talks-on-wind-turbine- tests-51140-26434889/2/ Although one of the few high voltage testing facilities in the world, the facility was closed by Narec in 2011 due to a lack of government funding. Many parts of the lab were relocated to Narec's main campus in Blyth. The ruins of the original lab are now the property of Siemens. Current facilitiesCharles Parsons Technology Centre= Built in 2004, this £5m facility contains a low voltage electrical laboratory for the testing of connecting renewable energy systems to the transmission and distribution grid.

with the Royal Engineers between 1939 and 1963, after which he served in a series of military intelligence roles until his retirement from the army in 1975. Willison then became Director-General of British Intelligence until 1978. Family and private life Willison was born in Camberley. Before attending Wellington College, David Willison lived in Egypt, where his father, Brigadier A C Willison served. David Willison was married twice. First, in 1941 to Betty Vernon Bates with whom he had three children (a son and two daughters);Debrett's People of Today 1994 after Betty's death, he married Trisha Clitherow in 1994.Obituary: Lieutenant General Sir David Willison The Times, 30 April 2009 Army career After Wellington College, Willison came first in the army entrance exam and attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, passing out top of his year and winning the Pollock Medal for the highest academic achievement of his term. He was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1939, and in 1942 he was an instructor at the School of Military Engineering (specialising in bailey bridges). Willison's first active service was briefly at Sword Beach at Ouistreham in Normandy on D-Day. He was in command of 17th Field Company, attached to the 3rd Divisional engineers and, during fighting at Bénouville on the evening of D-Day, he was seriously wounded by shrapnel and did not return to service until the following August. The wound caused pain for much of his life. On his return to the 3rd Divisional engineers, Willison took command of 246 Field Company, near Venray in the Netherlands. In March, 1945, during the advance on Bremen, his company had to reopen a mined road and a demolished bridge through flooded low-lying lands, in preparation for an assault. Working under heavy shelling, he supervised the installation of a bailey bridge and the clearance of mines and obstructions. In particular, he personally made safe a naval mine, for which he was awarded the Military Cross. Over the following several postwar years, Willison attended the Staff College, Camberley (where he was judged to be one of the most outstanding students), served as brigade major with 1 Indian Infantry Brigade as part of the reoccupation force in Java, served as a staff officer at HQ Malaya Command, posted to the War Office in London and took command of 16 Field Company, Royal Engineers, stationed in Egypt. In 1953, he was posted to Berlin to command the Royal Engineers there. While in Berlin, Willison assisted with a clandestine Anglo-American effort to tap a major Russian military telephone cable, by constructing an underground facility (the Russians discovered the security breach a few months later). After a spell from 1955 to 1958 as an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley, Willison was posted to Aden where he supported the Special Air Service's assistance to the Sultan of Oman in the Djebel Akhdar during a pro-Nasser rebellion. He subsequently commanded 38 Engineer Regiment from 1960. This unit was part of the Strategic reserve, with detachments in several trouble spots; this gave Willison additional international experience. In 1963, Willison was appointed as Colonel MI4 at the War Office with assessments of Middle Eastern issues as his main concern. Key Intelligence appointments followed his acknowledged success at MI4: Brigadier Defence Intelligence in 1967, Assistant Chief of Staff (Intelligence) in Northern Army Group in 1970, Director of Service Intelligence in 1971 and finally Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Intelligence) in 1972. Later career Willison retired from the army in 1975, but stayed within public service. He was immediately appointed as Director-General of Intelligence (equivalent to a Deputy Under Secretary of State) until retirement in 1978. During this period, the Labour Government of the day was persuaded to increase defence spending and renew the British nuclear deterrent, against official Labour Party policy. During his period in intelligence, Willison built an international reputation for himself. After retirement, Willison became a consultant, first to the National Westminster Bank and then to County NatWest Investment Bank, until 1991. David Willison died on 24 April 2009. Assessment Willison was a highly capable man with a rapid grasp of complex issues and the ability to express them clearly and simply. He was blessed with a good memory and wide breadth of knowledge. His abilities showed themselves during the various professional courses he undertook and he either passed out top or impressed as a brilliant student. He demanded high standards of those around him and his abrupt manner made uncomfortable to subordinates and superiors alike, but he would be loyal to those who achieved such standards and supportive of those afflicted by tragedy. Honours Apart from his Military Cross, Willison was appointed OBE in 1958 and knighted in 1973. He assumed the honorary roles of Colonel Commandant, Royal Engineers (1973–1982) and of Chief Royal Engineer (1977–1982) and Freeman of the City of London in 1981.

He was founder and president of the Jackie Robinson Sports Association, a baseball league serving 650 at-risk girls and boys. He trained his coaches not only to teach baseball but also required them to serve as mentors and tutors.

He later served as Chief Judge of the Circuit for a two-year term beginning July 2003. Perry attended St. Augustine's College, graduating in 1966 with a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration and Accounting. After serving in the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant, he went on to Columbia Law School where he earned his Juris Doctorate degree in 1972.

It is a wooden building from the late 1830s in the Greek Revival architectural style, the only remaining church in the city in that style. A number of congregations have used the building since it was first erected. It was even a synagogue at one point, possibly leading to the nickname Vassar Temple, since it was built on land originally owned by Matthew Vassar, founder of Vassar College. In 1972 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and later became a contributing property to the Mill Street-North Clover Street Historic District. Building The church is rectangular, three bays by six, with the narrow, colonnaded facade facing east. It has only one story, plus an attic, but appears to have two due to its brick basement being exposed on all but the south sides. The gabled roof has a gentle pitch Four pilasters on the short sides, and six on the long, separate each bay. All are sided in flush board. The main entrance is a pedimented portico supported by four wooden Doric columns topped with flat-disced architraves topped by a frieze of alternating flat panels and triglyphs. The entablature is framed by a boxed cornice, and a small round window with segmented frame is at its center. The two main entrance doors have stained glass windows, and there are four larger ones on the longer elevations. All have the same design, of two columns on ornate bases supporting an arched ribbed baldachin-like canopy and ornament. History The property was first used for religious purposes in the mid-1830s, when a splinter group from the Presbyterian Church bought it from Matthew Vassar's family. The church design is based on a pattern in an 1833 builder's guide. Greek Revival architecture was popular and influential for public buildings, as well as having elements used for residential buildings. The Presbyterian congregation did not last, and they sold the building to the First Congregational Church in 1842. The church's ownership and uses reflected changing demographics of the city. Years later the congregation sold it to a private owner, who donated it to the local Masonic lodge in 1859. The next year the lodge sold it to Matthew Vassar, Jr. He sold it to a local synagogue, the Congregated Brethren of Israel, in 1868. This use led to it being referred to as the \\"Vassar Temple\\", which also referred to its front colonnade. The Second Baptist Church and the Farmer's and Manufacturer's Bank on Market Street are the only major non-residential Greek Revival buildings left in Poughkeepsie. The rest, such as the former city hall, have been demolished and superseded.

The Court held as follows: *The value of the employer-purchased annuities in question was taxable as part of taxpayer's gross income in the year in which the annuities were purchased. :*The annuities in question were nonassignable, and possession was retained by the employer until taxpayer reached age of retirement; and the employee's compensation was not reduced during these years, nor did he have election to receive in cash the amount paid.

Bamboo coral, family Isididae, is a family of mostly deep-sea coral of the phylum Cnidaria. It is a commonly recognized inhabitant of the deep sea, due to the clearly articulated skeletons of the species. Deep water coral species such as this are especially affected by the practice of bottom trawling. These organisms may be an important environmental indicator in the study of long term climate change, as some specimens of bamboo coral have been discovered that are 4,000 years old. Description Relatively little is known about bamboo coral. The skeletons of bamboo coral are made up of calcium carbonate in the form of tree-like branches alternating with joint- like nodes or axes composed of gorgonin protein. The alternation of the bony structures with the smaller gorgonin parts give the bamboo coral a finger-like appearance similar to that of the bamboo plant on land. Bamboo coral was reported in 2005 to have been found on a dozen seamounts in the Pacific Ocean between Santa Barbara, California, and Kodiak, Alaska. Ages and growth rates of bamboo coral in the deepest water are unknown. However, based on radiocarbon-based growth rate and age data from specimens in the Gulf of Alaska, the life span has been estimated to be between 75 and 126 years. Recently, a mission funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) discovered seven new species of bamboo coral in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, a U.S. National Monument lying primarily in deep waters off the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, using the Pisces V. Of these seven new species, six may represent completely new genera (that is, major new classification categories). Data from these findings are still being analyzed. A bamboo coral \\"tree\\", five feet tall, was described for the first time by the mission. Scientists also found an area of dead coral, about and more than deep. The cause of death of the coral community is unknown but it is estimated to have occurred several thousand to perhaps over a million years ago. Deep sea bamboo coral provides the ecosystems to support deep sea life and also may be among the first organisms to display the effects of changes in ocean acidification caused by excess carbon dioxide, since they produce growth rings similar to those of a tree and can provide a view of changes in the condition in the deep sea over time. Some bamboo coral can be especially long-lived; coral specimens as old as 4,000 years were found at the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, giving scientists a window into the ocean's past. One scientist said the coral provided \\"4,000 years worth of information about what has been going on in the deep ocean interior\\". Deep water coral organisms such as bamboo coral are especially affected by the practice of bottom trawling. Other research has raised the possibility that Isididae corals, because of their potential to mimic biological properties, may potentially be used as living bone implants as well as in aquatic cultivation.

Martin White) (1858 – 7 July 1928)Death registers, Scotland, http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk was a wealthy Scottish businessman and Liberal Party politician. He also took a keen interest in the establishment of the scientific study of sociology in association with his boyhood friend Patrick Geddes and was an enthusiastic supporter of the development of the pipe organ. White was born in New York City, the son of wealthy jute merchant James Farquhar White and his wife Elizabeth Grundy. White Sr. had, in 1849, established a 'dry goods' company, J F White & Co. in New York selling all kinds of imported and domestic textiles.Financial Review USA, 24 Aug 1897 However, with the onset of the American Civil War he had returned home to Scotland and leased Castle Huntly, Perthshire as the family home. In 1880 they bought and moved to a baronial castle at Balruddery, Angus, near the city of Dundee. Ran his family business from Dundee and New York, but took a back seat to pursue political and scientific interests. J Martin White studied engineering at Cassel in Germany and was very interested in the technological innovations of his time, becoming chairman of the Dundee Technical Institute. He was a keen photographer and had his own darkroom from the late 1870s. In April 1881 he and his father, James F White, installed electricity at their house, Balruddery by Longforgan, outside Dundee. They generated the electricity with a Siemens SDJ Shuntwound 50-volt dynamo driven by a turbine on a stream on the estateThe Electrician, 22 Jan 1886 and thus established probably the first domestic generating plant in Scotland and the second, after Cragside, in Britain. Martin White was also a collector and connoisseur of Japanese art.Dundee Free Library Report, June 1898 Parliamentary career By the 1890s White had become increasingly wealthy through the family business, J F White & Co. He first stood for Parliament at the 1892 general election, when he unsuccessfully contested St Andrews Burghs. When the Liberal member of parliament for Forfarshire, Sir John Rigby was appointed a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1894, it was expected that White would be the party's candidate at the ensuing by-election. However, a London-based stock-broker, Henry Robson was chosen, with the result that the seat was lost to the Liberal Unionists. A general election was held in the following year, and on this occasion White was chosen to contest the seat. He regained the seat comfortably for the Liberals, with a majority of 441 votes. His membership of the Commons was to be brief, however. Following weeks of rumours, the Dundee Advertiser reported on 14 November 1896 that he had resigned his seat. This was initially denied by his private secretary, who stated that he simply gone to India on business, and expected to return for the opening of parliament. However, on 20 November, the executive committee of the Forfarshire Liberal Association received an angry letter from White. In it, he stated that he had not intended to resign. However he felt the story had been inserted in the Advertiser by members of the committee, and this act of disloyalty meant that he no longer had any obligations to the party. Accordingly, he resigned his seat, by accepting appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. The reason for the rumours circulating in Dundee and for his resignation were that a court case for breach of promise to marry had been brought by clergyman's daughter Helen Grant. She and White had known each other from the age of twelve and had had a longstanding affair. Ella Grant claimed that she had become pregnant and had refused the abortion that had been suggested by White. White made an out-of-cort settlement and the case never became public knowledge at the time.Summons of Miss Helen or Ella Guillan Grant, 1896, National Archives of Scotland NAS02023 CS248‑2390/1. White was subsequently chosen as prospective Liberal candidate for the Wilton Division of Wiltshire. However, when a by-election occurred in July 1900, the Second Boer War was in progress. The party decided not to contest the seat, allowing James Morrison, an army officer, invalided from the front in South Africa, to be returned unopposed. At the general election in October 1900, White did contest Wilton, but Morrison held the seat with a majority of 841 votes (12.6% of the total).Craig, page 418 At the 1906 general election, he failed to be elected at Great Yarmouth. He lodged an election petition, attempting to have the result overturned due to alleged bribery, treating and illegal payments by his Conservative opponent Arthur Fell. The election court found that treating and bribery had indeed taken place, but the two judges sitting on the case did not agree whether Fell was responsible for the actions of a Mr Baker who was found to have had acted illegally. The first judge, Justice Channell, held that Baker was acting as an agent of Fell; but the more senior judge, Justice Grantham, held that Fell was not responsible, and the petition was therefore dismissed. However, the outcome was widely denounced as perverse, and was one of a series of election petition judgments in which Grantham (himself a former Conservative MP) was seen to have acted in a partisan manner. The judgment in the Yarmouth petition was the subject of a debate in the Commons in July 1906 in which Grantham's partisanship was widely condemned. Academic endowments and Philanthropy White developed a close friendship with Patrick Geddes, and endowed a chair of botany for him at University College Dundee. Geddes was developing the field of sociology, and White began generously funding the teaching of the subject at the University of London. He eventually provided an endowment to create a Department of Sociology at the university.Scott, John and Bromley, Ray 2013. Envisioning Sociology: Victor Branford, Patrick Geddes, and Social ReconstructionNew York: SUNY Press: p 32. A lifelong philanthropist, each July and August for over 15 years he turned a farmhouse on the estate into a holiday camp for poor and disabled children from the slums of Dundee, enabling over 200 children a year to benefit from two weeks of clean air, healthy outdoor activities and good food. In 1892 he limited outdoor labourers on his estate to a 9-hour day, granting them also a half-day on Saturdays and a week's annual holiday.Obituary, The Dundee Courier and Advertiser 9 July 1928 In 1903 he instituted a pension scheme for all employees on the Balruddery Estate.Dundee Advertiser, 9 April 1903 Some of the many other organisations benefiting from his largesse included the Scottish Amateur Gymnastics Association, St Andrew's University, Dundee Medical School and Dundee Technical Institute. Development of the pipe organ White developed a love of the pipe organ, becoming an expert on the instrument, and president of the Organ Club. He financially supported Robert Hope-Jones in his development of the theatre organ. In the central hall at Balruddery he had installed an organ that, originally built by Casson and voiced by Thynne, had been reconstructed by Hope-Jones with electric action, double and pizzicato touches and some new stops. In 1913, George Laing Miller, in The Recent Revolution in Organ Building wrote: > Mr White... has managed to devote much time and thought to the art of organ > playing and organ building...All honor to Martin White! Family life White was married twice. On 6 August 1898 he married Mary MacRae, a watercolourist, and they had two children. Due to his infidelity the marriage broke down in 1906, and the couple were divorced in 1912. Mary MacRae White went on to be a successful artist in the United States. In 1913 he married Alice (Priscilla) Frost, a widow. Death J Martin White died suddenly at Balruddery in July 1928. He was buried locally, with a monument to his memory erected in Liff Parish Church.

It is raised principally in Tuscany and Umbria, but also in Abruzzo, Emilia–Romagna, Lazio, the Marche and Campania. The breed was created in the 1970s by cross-breeding and subsequent selection of local breeds such as the Bariscianese, the Casentinese, the Chietina Varzese, the Pagliarola, the Perugina del piano, the Pomarancina, the Senese delle Creti and the Vissana with Bergamasca rams and with the French Ile-de-France and Berrichon du Cher, with the aim of increasing the meat yield. The breed was recognised in 1980 and a herdbook established in 1981. Although this is a medium-coarse wool breed, it is raised primarily for meat. It has been used in the development of the Laticauda breed in the Campanian Apennines. Characteristics The Appenninica is hornless (polled) in both sexes; the ears are carried horizontally. The average weight for mature rams is ; average height at the withers is and average length . When mature, ewes weigh on average 56 kg, are 69 cm at the withers and are 73 cm long. Rams yield about of wool while ewes provide 1.5 kg. The wool has a diameter of 30 to 35 micrometres. The breed is well adapted to the terrain of the Apennine Mountains, Emilia and Abruzzo regions of Italy. It is one of the seventeen autochthonous Italian sheep breeds for which a genealogical herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep-breeders. From 1993 to 2007, the population of the Appenninica declined from greater than 160,000 to 3438. In 2013 total numbers for the breed were 9791. ReferencesFurther reading * R. Bozzi, P.

Battle At 11:30 on the morning of May 7, 2009, a Presidential Guard battalion led by General Toufa Abdoulaye ambushed a column of UFR rebels on the eastern outskirts of Am Dam, a village 100 kilometers south of Abéché in southeastern Chad. Mounted infantry from both sides exchanged fire from the backs of Toyota “technicals” mounted with heavy weapons. One eyewitness saw anti-aircraft weapons used against targets on the ground. Am Dam’s hospital sustained severe damage when a government vehicle offloading casualties drew fire from rebels forces, which also destroyed 14 civilian structures in the vicinity with errant shells. According to hospital workers, government soldiers returned fire and promptly withdrew. Less than an hour after the skirmish began, rebel vehicles that were passing to the south of Am Dam in an attempt to flank the smaller government force encountered an armored column of government reinforcements led by Hassan al Gadam al-Djineddi, chief of staff of the Chadian National Army, and General Tahir Ardah, general director of the Gendarmerie Nationale. The rebel flanking movement was eliminated, and by 2:30 the remnants of the UFR column was racing back to safe havens in Darfur, with government forces in hot pursuit. Official tallies later released by the government testified to the intensity of the fighting, with 247 combatants killed, 225 of them rebels. Of the 212 rebels taken into custody, 83 were minors. With government control firmly established, soldiers broke into the hospital pharmacy and commandeered medical supplies. Civilian volunteers in Am Dam and the adjacent village of Am Dam Zeribe were organized into six teams of volunteers to collect and bury the dead. One burial committee encountered 11 rebel corpses, seven of whom had an entry wound in the forehead or between the eyes. One government soldier was found with his eyes gouged out. Government soldiers conducting security sweeps in Am Dam and surrounding villages for wounded rebels pursued a group of insurgents to the village of Galbassa, two kilometers east of Am Dam, where four rebels took refuge in a home that was occupied by six civilians. Government soldiers supported by a T-55 tank drew within five meters of the structure and ordered the civilians to leave. Five civilians emerged, with two rebels in their midst. Both rebels were killed by government soldiers and three of the five civilians suffered gunshot wounds, including a 14-year-old boy. The structure from which they had emerged was then deliberately flattened, killing the two remaining rebels and crushing to death Youssouf Abakar, a 55-year-old civilian and the father of eight children. Abakar was one of 15 civilians killed during the combat. Government soldiers remained in the Am Dam area for six days, during which time the nearby hamlet of Mashangala was systematically looted valuables. In the early evening of May 7, government soldiers descended upon Galbassa under the pretense of searching for rebels and sexually assaulted two sisters, a 19-year-old woman and a 14-year-old girl. The women of Galbassa evacuated the village the following morning for the nearby towns of Gasdjamoudes and Habanier and did not return until after government forces withdrew from the area. Control of Tissi In May 2009, simultaneous with the UFR raid on Am Dam, the Front Populaire pour la Renaissance Nationale (FPRN) a Chadian rebel group led by Adoumj Yacoub, occupied the strategic town of Tissi at the Chad, Sudan, Central African Republic tri-point.

Introduction The interactivity channel aspects of the Brazilian Digital Terrestrial Television Standards are described in document ABNT NBR 15607-1:2008 - Digital terrestrial television – Interactivity channel -Part 1: Protocols, physical and software Interfaces, published by ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas).ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas) The standard establishes the ways in which a receiver device can send information back to the broadcaster through different communication means. The transmission of common broadcasting content will be done through the air through the main programming feed, while a more customized use of content can be sent through the interactive channel. Document technical overview Brazilian proposal for the interactivity channel is focused on flexibility and is based on TCP/IP protocol. Receiver shall have a USB interface for an external Modem connection. This is adequate to comply with an existing telecomm infrastructure of multiple technologies and is also open for future innovations. Also, the standard allows for many different possible ways of connecting a receiver device to a network, and use it as an interactivity channel. Future technologies in communications can be easily integrated in the proposed system. These documents are also available at ABNT website. Summary Interactivity channel is the name used for any communication mean that allows a receiver to send information back to the broadcaster. Some times called return channel, the name interactivity channel seems more correct since applications can be sent through the broadcast side and the through the channel itself. The document describing the reference specification for the interactivity channel is ABNT NBR 15607-1:2008 - Digital terrestrial television – Interactivity channel -Part 1: Protocols, physical and software Interfaces.

Guy Yves Stephany created GYS in 1964 with the purpose of manufacturing auto- transformers on behalf of EDF for the west part of France. 1970: In the early 1970s, GYS expanded its product range with car battery chargers. The company first engineered and manufactured car battery chargers in 6 V, then in 6 V/12 V and finally in 6 V/12 V/24 V. In the late 1970s, an additional product expansion is realized with the manufacturing of GYS' first welding machine. 1980–1996: Over 16 years, the company GYS is bought by two industrial holdings. During the same period, the company expanded its portfolio of welding products. 1997: GYS is acquired by the current management. The company had at the time a strong local brand in France for its battery charger range. The sale of welding products was more confidential and mostly concentrated in agricultural and automotive markets. 1997–2001: After the acquisition, significant investments are quickly made to modernize the historical French factory. Simultaneously, the management decided to expand the transformer- based welding machines range with the manufacturing of GYS first inverter electrode welding machine. 2001–2004: The company continues to invest in R&D; to expand its inverter welding range to TIG/Plasma and MIG as well as its battery charger catalogue. During the same period, the management decided to expand the company product range with a third product range: automotive body repair spot welding products. Significant investments are made to continue to expand the French factory to match growing demand. 2004–Today: During this period, the group expands its three product families and decides to accelerate its international expansion with the opening of international subsidiaries. * 2004: An industrial subsidiary is opened in Shanghai, China to manufacture a range of retail battery chargers * 2006: A commercial subsidiary is opened in Aachen, Germany * 2008: A commercial subsidiary is opened in Warwick, UK * 2011: A second company (commercial subsidiary) is opened in Shanghai, China * 2013: A subsidiary is opened in Coimbatore, India * 2014: A new R&D; center is opened in Laval, France * 2015: A subsidiary is opened in Venice, Italy * 2018: A second factory in France is under construction Laval, France External links * * The complete press can be found here Category:Manufacturing companies of France ","title":"GYS (company)"},{"id":"22764764","text":"Alan M.

In the 19th century, the theatre was an integral part of the Czech National Revival. Later, in the 20th century, many notable theatre makers influenced the European theatre art. Between 1739–1783 the Divadlo v Kotcích (English: Kotzen Theatre), a theatre and opera venue on v Kotcích street in Prague, enjoyed its heyday as the second public opera theatre in Prague. The opera theatre of Franz Anton von Sporck was also a notable public theatre in the city at this time.Daniel E. Freeman, D. E., 1992, The opera theater of Count Franz Anton von Sporck in Prague The Estates Theatre was initially built with the intention of producing German dramas and Italian operas, but works in other languages were also staged. Czech productions were first staged in 1785 in order to reach a broader Czech audience but by 1812 they became a regular feature of Sunday and holiday matinees. The somewhat political nature of these performances later led to idea of founding a National Theatre after 1848 with the defeat of the revolution and the departure of J.K. Tyl. Many of the founding Czech dramatists were involved in the Estates Theatre, such as the brothers Thám (Karel and Václav), J.K. Tyl, Ján Kollár, and so on. National Theatre, 2007 Before the early 1860s almost all cultural institutions in Prague, including theatre and opera, was in Austrian hands. Bohemia was a province of the Habsburg Empire, and under that regime's absolutist rule most aspects of Czech culture and national life had been discouraged or suppressed.Steen, p. 697 Absolutism was formally abolished by a decree of the Emperor Franz Josef on 20 October 1860, which led to a Czech cultural revival.Large, pp. 114–15 The Bohemian Diet (parliament) had acquired a site in Prague on the banks of the Vltava, and in 1861 announced a public subscription, which raised a sum of 106,000 gulden. This covered the costs of building a small 800-seat theatre,Steen, p. 698 which would act as a home for production of Czech drama and opera while longer-term plans for a permanent National Theatre could be implemented.Clapham, pp. 32–33 The Provisional Theatre opened on 18 November 1862, with a performance of Vítězslav Hálek's tragic drama King Vukašín.Large, pp. 124–25 The drama of the First Czechoslovak Republic followed the same stylistic evolution as poetry and prose — expressionism, followed by a return to realistic, civilian theatre (František Langer, Karel Čapek). Avantgarde theatre also flourished, focusing on removing the barriers between actors and audience, breaking the illusion of the unity of a theatrical work (Osvobozené divadlo, Jiří Voskovec and Jan Werich). In the 1930s, Karel Čapek wrote his most politically charged (and well-known) plays in response to the rise of fascist dictators. Václav Havel found employment in Prague's theatre world as a stagehand at Prague's Theatre ABC – Divadlo ABC, and then at the Theatre On Balustrade – Divadlo Na zábradlí. Simultaneously, he was a student of dramatic arts by correspondence at the Theatre Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (DAMU). His first own full-length play performed in public, besides various vaudeville collaborations, was The Garden Party (1963). Presented in a series of Theatre of the Absurd, at the Theatre on Balustrade, this play won him international acclaim. The play was soon followed by The Memorandum, one of his best known plays, and The Increased Difficulty of Concentration, all at the Theatre on Balustrade. In 1968, The Memorandum was also brought to The Public Theater in New York, which helped to establish Havel's reputation in the United States. The Public Theater continued to produce his plays in the following years. After 1968, Havel's plays were banned from the theatre world in his own country, and he was unable to leave Czechoslovakia to see any foreign performances of his works.Václav Havel Obituary.

The Conundrum Kleinwachter's conundrum imagines two equally salaried employees: an ordinary military officer and a flugeladjutant (a regimental aide-de-camp) to the sovereign. First, imagine that the flugeladjutant \\"receives quarters in the palace, food at the royal table, servants, and horses for sport. He accompanies the prince to theatre and opera, and, in general, lives royally at no expense to himself and is able to save generously from his salary.\\" To complicate this problem, suppose further that the flugeladjutant detests opera and hunting. How, Kleinwächter asks, can they be equitably taxed? Revived by Henry Simons The conundrum was popularized by Henry Simons, who mentioned it in his tax treatise, Personal Income Taxation.See \\"Kleinwachter's Conundrum\\" in Simons, Personal Income Taxation (1938) at p. 53 In illustrating this point, Simons referred to this one of several hypotheticals posed by Kleinwächter.For a translation of Kleinwächter's discussion, see Friedrich Kleinwächter, Das Einkommen und Seine Verteilung (Leipzig: C.L. Hirschfeld, 1896) trans. by Hannelore McDowell at 6. Consequences for tax policy Simons laments that the problem this example poses to equitable taxation \\"is clearly hopeless\\": To omit all compensation in kind is clearly inappropriate. On the other hand, to include the perquisites implies that all income should be measured with regard for the subjective relative pleasureableness of diverse activities—the negation of measurement. Because it is difficult to measure actual utility from personal consumption (which includes in-kind benefits consumed by employees, but also leisure time, and the imputed income from self-performed services and ownership of consumer durables), tax policy seeks to sensibly and fairly delimit the concept of income in the context of the taxation of in-kind benefits by developing guidelines that balance equity, neutrality, and administrability.Delimiting the Concept of Income: The Taxation of In-Kind Benefits.

Introduction The operational guidelines aspects of the Brazilian Digital Terrestrial Television Standards are described in the following documents published by ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas):ABNT, the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas) ABNT NBR 15608-1:2008 - Digital terrestrial television - Operational guideline - Part 1: Transmission ; ABNT NBR 15608-2:2008 - Digital terrestrial television - Operational guideline - Part 2: Video coding, audio coding and multiplexing; and ABNT NBR 15608-3:2008 - Digital terrestrial television - Operational guideline - Part 3: Multiplexing and SI/PSI Tables The standard describes in further detail the parts of the digital television system that need clarifying, setting directives for implementation in a combination of mandatory and optional features. It can be seen as a refinement of the original specification documents focused on system implementation. Document technical overview The standards are a flexible system allowing terrestrial broadcasters to choose from a variety of options to suit their various service environments. This allows the choice between fixed roof-top antenna, portable and even mobile reception of services. Broadly speaking the trade-off is of service bit-rate versus signal robustness. This way, operational guidelines play an important part in setting levels of performance and general paths for proper implementations by manufacturers and software developers. The terrestrial digital television implementation is not only a technical and business challenge but also represents an effective means of giving access of the digital technology to all socio-economic segments of society. The upcoming work is the establishment of a test centre which is expected for the following months. Brazilian digital television is in its early stages of development and implementation with a very promising future. Most of the component sub-systems are based on existing international standards, but used in an innovative and unique combination. The Brazilian DTTB system uses state-of-the-art technologies with no prejudice whatsoever to time-to-market of receivers in the one year range. Economical aspects related to investments in broadcast equipment are also being carefully addressed. The implementation of DTTB in Brazil includes financing and special industrial policies that match the Latin America reality. The ultimate goal of the whole process is to promote a smooth introduction of the free-to-air terrestrial digital television service with adequate levels of knowledge and confidence throughout the whole productive chain, with an ultimate positive impact to the Brazilian society. These documents are also officially available at ABNT website. Summary Operational guidelines are interpretations of the technical standards aimed at the implementations required for a specific case. It also serves as a baseline approach to developers and manufacturers seeking compliance with the rest of the system. The documents describing the operational guidelines are ABNT NBR 15608-1:2008 - Digital terrestrial television - Operational guideline - Part 1: Transmission; ABNT NBR 15608-2:2008 - Digital terrestrial television - Operational guideline - Part 2: Video coding, audio coding and multiplexing; and ABNT NBR 15608-3:2008 - Digital terrestrial television - Operational guideline - Part 3: Multiplexing and SI/PSI Tables ReferencesExternal links *ABNT website http://www.abnt.org.br/tvdigital *SBTVD Forum SBTVD Forum website http://www.forumsbtvd.org.br/ *ARIB Association of Radio Industries and Businesses website http://www.arib.or.jp/english/ *DiBEG Digital Broadcasting Experts Group website http://www.dibeg.org/ Category:ABNT standards ","title":"ABNT NBR 15608"},{"id":"22764888","text":"Mission Ridge may refer to: *Mission Ridge (British Columbia), a ridge in British Columbia, Canada *Mission Ridge Winter Park, ski area in Saskatchewan, Canada *Mission Ridge Ski Area, a ski resort near Wenatchee, Washington, United States *Mission Ridge, South Dakota, an unincorporated community in South Dakota, United States *Mission Ridge, California; consists of Mission Peak, Mount Allison, Monument Peak ","title":"Mission Ridge"},{"id":"22764896","text":"Tahoe Valley is a former unincorporated community in El Dorado County, California, now incorporated into South Lake Tahoe.

The railway administration is located in Irkutsk. The East Siberian Railway borders with the Krasnoyarsk Railway (railway station of Yurty), Trans-Baikal Railway (railway station of Petrovsky Zavod), and Baikal Amur Mainline (railway station of Lena-Vostochnaya). To the south, the East Siberian Railway runs close to the Russo-Mongolian border (railway station of Naushki). As of 2008, the total working length of the East Siberian Railway was ; number of employees – 46,233 (61,418 in 2005); net weight hauled – 76 million tonnes (75.934 million in 2005); long-distance passenger traffic – 3.6 million people (4.838 million in 2005); suburban traffic – 29 million people (26.225 million in 2005). Annual cargo turnover is 278 million tonnes. The East Siberian Railway consists of four divisions, namely the Irkutsk Railway Division, Severobaikalsk Railway Division, Taishet Railway Division, and Ulan-Ude Railway Division. The railway connects the regions of East Siberia, Transbaikal, and Russian Far East with the rest of the railroad network nationwide. The East Siberian Railway services major industrial areas of iron ore and coal mining, oil refining, logging and wood processing, companies and factories in energy, chemical, machine building and machine-tool industries, nonferrous metallurgy, etc. In addition, the railway services agricultural grain-producing and cattle-breeding regions. The biggest points of cargo departure and arrival are Cheremkhovo, Korshunikha, Kitoy- Kombinatskaya, Sukhovskaya, Irkutsk-Sortirovochniy, Ulan-Ude, Lena, and Bratsk. Construction history Irkutsk railway station The idea of building a railway across sparsely populated and almost unexplored areas of East Siberia was first expressed in the 1870s-1880s. The need for constructing a railway line became particularly evident after the completion of the Ural Railway from Yekaterinburg to Tyumen in 1884. In 1887, three expeditions were organised to explore the route for the future Trans-Siberian Railway. In May 1893, the Committee for the Construction of the Siberian Railway was created. The construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway was launched simultaneously from its two extremities, namely Vladivostok and Chelyabinsk. By 1895, the construction of the section of railway from Chelyabinsk to the railway station of Ob near the small settlement of Novonikolaevsky (today's Novosibirsk) was complete. On December 6, 1895 the first train arrived at Krasnoyarsk, which would become a starting point for the construction of the East Siberian Railway towards Irkutsk and through Nizhneudinsk (the first train arrived on December 9, 1897) towards Tulun. In 1897, the construction of the Irkutsk - Baikalsky and Mysovaya – Sretensk sections was under way. Railway stations were built along almost the whole of the railway. In 1898 the construction of the Tulun-Irkutsk section was finished. In 1900 the Transbaikal sections from Mysovaya to Sretensk and from Irkutsk to the Baikal railway station were completed. The Circum-Baikal section (between the railway stations Mysovaya and Baikal) of the East Siberian Railway was under construction until 1905, opening non-stop train traffic along the whole railway when construction ended. A rural railway station on the East Siberian Railway At first, the East Siberian Railway was a single-track railroad. In 1907, they began the construction of the second track, which would end in 1916. Administratively, the main line was divided into four railways: the Siberian Railway (from Chelyabinsk to Innokentyevskaya railway station with a line towards Tomsk), the Transbaikal Railway (from Innokentyevskaya railway station to Sretensk with a line towards Manchuria railway station), the Ussuri Railway (from Vladivostok to Khabarovsk), and the Amur Railway (from Kuyenga railway station to Khabarovsk). In 1915, the East Siberian Railway was divided into five railways, the Omsk Railway, Tomsk Railway, Transbaikal Railway, Amur Railway, and Ussuri Railway. In 1934, the East Siberian Railway became an independent administrative and economic unit extending from Mariinsk railway station to Mysovaya railway station. In 1936, the Krasnoyarsk Railway was excluded from the East Siberian Railway. In the 1920s-1930s, technical reconstruction of the railway was carried out and its locomotive and rolling stock were upgraded . Several new lines were also built over the ridges of Sayany, Alatau, taiga, and swamps towards coal and iron ore deposits, woodlands, and banks of large rivers. In 1922-1926, the Achinsk–Abakan line was constructed, which connected the southern areas of Krasnoyarsk Krai, Khakassia, and Tuva with other economic regions of the country. In 1940, train traffic began from Ulan-Ude to Naushki, significantly improving economic relations with Mongolia and providing access to the Gusinoozyorsk coal deposits. During the Great Patriotic War, the authorities of the East Siberian Railway provided volunteer units to be dispatched to the front (20 railmen would be awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union), found resources for repairing military equipment, prepared rolling stock, and gradually increased the amount of freight from Siberia to the European part of the country. In the post-war years, the amount of traffic carried continued its increase along with the reconstruction of transportation facilities and introduction of new technology. In 1948, the East Siberian Railway reached its pre-war loading and cargo-turnover level. In 1958, they commissioned the new Taishet-Bratsk-Lena railway, which connected the basins of the Angara and Lena Rivers with the rest of the Siberian railroad network, providing immediate access to mineral deposits in the Angara basin (e.g. the Korshunovskoye iron ore deposit) and abundant logging regions and ensuring an uninterrupted supply of cargo to the northern areas of Irkutsk Oblast and Yakutia. At the end of 1965, a long Abakan-Taishet section of the East Siberian Railway was commissioned, an electrified high-class railroad with modern means of communication, electric interlocking of railroad switches, and a remote dispatching system. This section of the railway provided a new access to the Kuzbass, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia from the regions of the Russian Far East and Siberia. The early 1970s saw the completion of construction of the northbound line from the Khrebtovaya railway station to Ust-Ilimsk Hydroelectric Powerplant (). Cargo types As far as transit cargo is concerned, the largest components of this are ferrous metals, petroleum products, grain shipments, and products of the light, food, chemical, and machine-building industries. Imported goods usually consist of metals, construction materials, petroleum products, the products of the machine building, light and food industries, also partially of grain shipments. Exports consist of timber, oil, iron ore, aluminium and coal. Locally, the railway mostly transports construction goods, coal, timber, petroleum and agricultural produce. The East Siberian Railway was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1976. Engineering Railway station in Slyudyanka During the construction of several sections of the East Siberian Railway, various scientific and technical achievements were widely used. The railway essentially became a test site for alternating current electrification. They tested and perfected the design of alternating current locomotives, overhead catenary system, means of communication, signaling, centralised traffic control and the automatic block system, all of which would later be introduced on other railways in one way or another. 97% of the traffic along the East Siberian Railway is done by means of electric traction. The East Siberian Railway consists of several sections, one of which is the Circum-Baikal Railway – a monument to industrial architecture of federal importance. It stretches for over from the Baikal railway station to the Kultuka railway station. The uniqueness of this wonder of engineering is that no other railway in the world has as many man-made objects, namely 40 tunnels, 16 avalanche galleries, 470 overpasses, bridges, and pipe culverts, some 280 protecting walls, let alone various buildings at different railway stations. The Circum-Baikal Railway is also known as the \\"golden buckle of the steel belt\\" (the Trans-Siberian Railway being the \\"steel belt\\") because the construction of the greatest Russian railway was finished on the shores of Lake Baikal. In December 2003, the Severomuysky Tunnel on the Baikal-Amur Mainline (a section of the East Siberian Railway) was commissioned, the longest tunnel in Russia and the fifth longest in the world (). The station building at Slyudyanka railway station of the East Siberian Railway is the only railway station in the world made completely of marble.

It is endemic to Ventura County, California, where it is known from only three occurrences in the vicinity of Conejo Mountain between Camarillo and Thousand Oaks.California Native Plant Society, Rare Plant Program. 2018. Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants of California (online edition, v8-03 0.39). Website http://www.rareplants.cnps.org accessed 20 July 2018. It probably occurs in a few additional locations nearby which have not yet been officially vouchered.USFWS. Dudleya verityi Five-year Review. August 17, 2009. Description This is a fleshy perennial plant growing from a branching caudex several centimeters long. The leaves appear in a basal rosette about the caudex, each oblong to lance-shaped and generally pointed. The leaves are waxy in texture, pale grayish or pinkish green in color, and up to 5 centimeters long. The erect inflorescence is composed of a bract-lined peduncle up to 15 centimeters tall which splits into terminal branches each bearing several flowers. The flower has a base of fleshy, triangular sepals and longer, bright yellow petals just over a centimeter long. Ecology This dudleya associates with mosses and lichens. It often grows in layers of the lichen Niebla ceruchoides, which may provide a moisture-capturing bed for seeds that fall from it. This dudleya hybridizes with other species, such as Dudleya blochmaniae. This species is only found on one edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, where it occurs in coastal sage scrub habitat. The dominant plants are California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum) and purple sage (Salvia leucophylla). At least two occurrences are within the campus bounds of California State University, Channel Islands. Conservation It is a federally listed threatened species, with the main threat to its existence being destruction of its habitat for development, mining, and flood control. The Springs Fire in 2013 nearly wiped it out and the years-long drought that continued afterwards has made for a very tough recovery. Evidence of poaching was discovered in 2019.

It currently has 75 families and 35 social members sailing 28-foot E-Scow, 19-foot Lightning, and 13-foot Sunfish class boats in three regattas held from June through early October. History The Wawasee Yacht Club has a strong sailing tradition that began over 70 years ago and continues today. The flagpole and adjacent plaque near the Wawasee Yacht Club clubhouse was dedicated in 1972 to commemorate the memory and the efforts of Joseph Plasket as one of the founders and as one of the former commodores of the club. Joe Plasket, Ed Dodez, Byron McCammon and Henry Wahl came to Lake Wawasee in 1935 to see if it would be a good location to sail, and perhaps race, their boats. Bishop’s Boat Livery and Marine Supply, which was located on the northeast corner of the lake near the Eli Lilly property, gave the men permission to use a porch as a meeting place and base of operations as they started racing their handcrafted Snipe sailboats. They were soon joined by a group of local sailors, creating SCIRA's Snipe fleet number 40. Some of them (the Levinson and Call families) are still part of the club today. With membership increasing, and with the financial support of Eli Lilly, the porch was enclosed for meetings. After being in existence less than 4 years the Wawasee Yacht Club emerged as a worthy host of the 1938 Snipe World Championship. In the following year, 1939, the club was incorporated as a legal entity and, with the continued assistance of Eli Lilly, purchased the current land and original clubhouse on Trusdell Avenue. The nearby Tavern Hotel gave the club a 10’ easement so boats could be taken down to the lake and launched for racing. The war years of the early 1940s naturally limited the club’s activities. However, the club rebounded quickly as members were discharged from military duty and it once again became the focus of sailboat racing on Lake Wawasee. Snipe (dinghy) were raced into the early 1950s; but the Lightning (dinghy) fleet grew quickly in the late 1940s. By the mid-1950s, the WYC raced only the classic Stephens and Sparkman-designed Lightning (dinghy). Eli Lilly, who had founded the earlier Wawasee Yacht and Canoe Club in the 1890s and had traditionally sailed boats named “Cynthia”, bequeathed the sterling silver Cynthia’s Cup to the WYC in 1949. The bequest stated that the cup was to be given annually to the season’s highest ranked skipper. Today the tradition continues with the trophy being shared by the top skippers in single-handed and multi-crewed fleets. In the early 1950s, the Tavern Hotel burned to the ground and was replaced by two lake homes. Along with its existing boat launching area, the club was able to gain additional lake frontage that gave the club the boat yard it has today. In 1954, the club hosted its 1st Hoosier Regatta for Lightnings—a regatta that has run continually and celebrated its 50th Anniversary in early October 2004. This fall classic is the traditional closing event of the WYC’s racing season For many years, the Lightning fleet was the mainstay of the Wawasee Yacht Club, but by the early 1990s the local Wawasee Boating Association had developed a growing fleet of E-Scow. The merger of the two groups re-invigorated the WYC and led the way for more growth. The annual E-Scow regatta in early June has become one of the best- attended E-Scow regattas in the region. In the early 1980s, a Laser (dinghy) fleet was started at the club. For lady sailors, the “Wawashe’s” started a series of races and training in Sunfish (sailboat) in mid-1990s. From that start, a full racing fleet developed and the Lake Wawasee Sunfish Regatta in August of each season has quickly developed into one of the premier events on the Sunfish Midwest circuit. In September 2007 the Wawasee Yacht Club hosted the 2007 Women’s Sunfish North American Championship General information Today the club currently has 3 active racing fleets: Lightning, E-Scow and Sunfish. On a typical Saturday morning 15-20 Sailboats participate in competitions on the lake, and on Sundays 8-10 E-Scows and an equal number of Lightnings also compete. In July, the club holds a Junior Sailing program, for the purpose of introducing youth members to the sport of sailboat racing. With a racing membership of 75 families and 35 social members, the club sponsors an active social schedule for families and adults. In 2001-2002, the WYC embarked on an extensive remodeling and expansion of the 1920s clubhouse under the guidance of architect and long-time member John Call and with the full financial support of the club membership.

It is the original mix of the band's 2003 album Welcome to the Monkey House, by Grammy Award-winning soul music mixing engineer Russell Elevado. It was released on July 14, 2009, through the band's own label Beat the World Records.  Background  Before the release of Welcome to the Monkey House, the band had been pressing for a version mixed by Elevado, whose credits include D'Angelo's Brown Sugar, The Roots' The Roots Come Alive, Common's Like Water for Chocolate and Alicia Keys' Songs in A Minor, along with some others. The Elevado mix of Monkey House was shelved by Capitol Records and an alternate mix by Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran was put out instead. Peter Holmstrom later said that Monkey House was not the version that he wanted released. In 2008, the band split from Capitol and formed their own label, Beat the World Records. With the band now on its own label, Holmstrom said the band decided the time was right to re-release the album's original mix. As Courtney Taylor-Taylor describes it, \\"There are two different approaches to mixing. One is very slick and clean, and Welcome to the Monkey House fits more into that category. Are Sound, however, has a sneakier profile. It seems very lo-fi and earthy, but the fact is, it's extremely precise.\\"  Track listing  Reception  The album received a lukewarm critical reception in comparison to Welcome to the Monkey House. Uncut magazine wrote, \\"an LP that once raved shamelessly now shuffles, twitchily.\\" The A.V. Club, which praised Monkey House, called this mix \\"basically a tasteful killjoy. The bass is reduced to human levels, most of the synths are purged and the drums sound thin and trembly. The first Monkey House is full of consistently aggressive hook-mongering; this version is all deliberately becalmed jamming and repetition.\\"  References  External links  * * Category:2009 albums Category:The Dandy Warhols albums ","title":"The Dandy Warhols Are Sound"},{"id":"22764947","text":"Tchikimisi is a former Maidu settlement in El Dorado County, California.

It is located at the intersection of the provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi, to the west of Fenxi County, and to the east of Yichuan County where the middle reaches of the Yellow River flow through Jinxia Grand Canyon. The width of the waterfall changes with the season, usually wide but increasing to during flood season. It has a height of over . When the Yellow River approaches the Hukou Mountain, blocked by mountains on both sides, its width is abruptly narrowed down to . The water's velocity increases, and then plunges over a narrow opening on a cliff, forming a waterfall high and wide, as if water were pouring down from a huge teapot. Hence it gets the name Hukou (literally, \\"flask mouth\\") Waterfall. In the middle of the river, about from the Hukou Waterfall, an enormous rock catches the attention of visitors. When the Yellow River flows to this point, divides into two, rolling and roaring on and on from both sides of the rock before reconverging. Beneath the waterfall is the Qilangwo Bridge which connects the two provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi. In the sunshine, the mist is refracted by sunlight to create a rainbow spanning the water like a colorful bridge. In 1991, Hukou Waterfall was named one of the \\"40 Best\\" national scenic spots. Due to its awkward location in the Loess Plateau hinterlands, Hukou was once very difficult to access. After the local government improved transport and tourist facilities, the number of tourists rose from 20,000 in 1994 to 47,000 in 1995. The figure for 1996 reached 100,000 tourists.

The Battle Late in 1643, the Parliamentarians held the town of Newport Pagnell with Olney as one of its outposts. Nearby, the Royalists held Northampton 17 km to the northwest of Olney. On 4 November 1643, Prince Rupert a Royalist commander for the King set out to march a detachment of his troops from Northampton to Newport Pagnell by mean of the road passing through the Olney outpost. When Prince Rupert and his troops entered Olney it caught the Parliamentarians by surprise. The Parliamentarian garrison immediately formed up and gathered at the Olney bridge which crosses the River Great Ouse. At the bridge, the Parliamentarians stopped Prince Rupert's forces and made a stand. The Royalists were the superior force and would have likely been able to overcome the Parliamentarians, however, they gave up the attack and retreated after a short while as it was their belief that Parliamentarian reinforcements under the command of cavalry General Oliver Cromwell were seen coming from Newport Pagnell.

After her brother's accession to the throne (1654), she and her siblings were all considered royal princesses and princes of Sweden.Ulf Sundberg in Kungliga släktband, Historiska media, Lund, 2004, p. 281 As the wife of Frederick, Landgrave of Hesse-Eschwege (1617–1655), she was by marriage Landgravine of Hesse-Eschwege, and after her husband's death acted as regent and administrator of his lands (1655–1692).Women in Power : 1640-1700  Biography  Eleonora was born at Stegeborg Castle in Östergötland, Sweden to Princess Catharina of Sweden and Johann Casimir, Count Palatine von Zweibrücken-Kleeburg. Her mother was an elder half-sister of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and the firstborn daughter of King Charles IX. Her parents, who were second cousins, had lived in Sweden since 1622, and Eleonora and her siblings, including her sister Maria Eufrosyne, grew up in Sweden as foster siblings of their cousin, Queen Christina of Sweden. Eleonora was only about seven months older than Christina and had the same teacher, Johannes Matthiæ. The negotiations concerning her marriage with Landgrave Frederick of Hesse-Eschwege, son of Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, started in 1643. The landgrave was a second cousin of both her parents and nine years her senior. The negotiation process was difficult, but finally completed in June 1646. She was granted a fortune of 20,000 gulden by her father. The marriage took place at Tre Kronor in Stockholm on 6 September 1646. After the wedding, Eleonora confessed before her husband, \\"on her knees\\", that she had had an affair with a French lute-player and actor, named Beschon, from the French court theatre of Antoine de Beaulieu, and was pregnant with his child.Eleonora Catharina in Riksarkivet.se (in Swedish) [retrieved 11 June 2014].Frederick of Hesse-Eschwege : News from the \\"great Fritz\\" in Weser Kurier.de (in German) [retrieved 11 June 2014]. Frederick decided to act like nothing happened and hide the matter, but it became a known scandal. Beschon wrote a composition to Eleonora which he sent her along with a letter dated 28 February 1647, but she gave it to her brother; this document is now preserved in the Stegeborg collection. In 1648, she referred to the queen's head lady-in-waiting Margareta Brahe as her \\"Dearest Protection\\", likely because Margareta Brahe had defended her when she gave birth to an illegitimate child.Fabian Persson (1999). Servants of Fortune. The Swedish court between 1598 and 1721. Lund: Wallin & Dalholm. p. 171 The marriage has been described as unhappy. Frederick took part in the war of his brother-in-law in Poland, where he was shot in 1655. Eleonora never remarried. It is said she was too embarrassed by the scandal with Beschon to return to the Swedish court, so she preferred to live in her fief Osterholz, where she founded a pharmacy and hired the first teacher and doctor of the town.Eleonora Catharine in heimatverein- lilienthal.de (in German) [retrieved 5 January 2015]. Eleonora was the administrator and regent of her husband's possessions in the Holy Roman Empire. Eleonora sent her daughter Juliana to be brought up at the Swedish royal court, where she was regarded as a prospective bride for Charles XI until she became pregnant in 1672. Eleonora did in fact visit Sweden a couple of times: in 1661, in 1674 and in 1681. During her 1674 visit, Lorenzo Magalotti described her as \\"a wicked, vain, strange, proud and melancholic woman\\" who spent most of her time in pious devotions. Eleonora died in Osterholz, Bremen (today's Germany) and is buried at the Altstädter Kirche (\\"Old City church\\") in Eschwege where now stands the Marktkirche (\\"Market Church\\"). Some of her notable descendants are Wilhelm II, German Emperor; Nicholas II of Russia; Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom; Charles, Prince of Wales; and the present king of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf.

Commissioner 36 B.T.A. 838 (1937) is a United States income tax case heard in the U.S. Board of Tax Appeals, discussing when an employee can exclude employer-provided benefits from his income. The Board held that a taxpayer employee may exclude the value of food and lodging received from his employer, if he receives it solely for the convenience of his employer and as a necessary incident of the proper performance of his duty. The meals-and- lodging exclusion has been formalized as §119 in the tax code. Background The petitioner managed hotels in Honolulu. He and his wife occupied a suite and received meals at and from the hotel, but did not report their value in his income. The Commissioner added $7,845 each year to gross income as compensation from Hawaiian Hotels, Ltd. Holding The Board heard the issue of whether the residence and meals at the hotel were compensation and therefore part of petitioner's gross income for which he could be taxed. The petitioner lived at the hotel solely because he could not otherwise perform the services required of him. The occupation of the premises was imposed upon him for the benefit of the employer. This is not to say that anytime an employee is fed or lodged by the employer that it is not taxable income. The court also looked at the intent of the parties and decided the employer never intended the room and board to form part of his compensation. Dissent The living quarters and meals were included in a letter forming the employment contract and therefore was intended to be compensation. He was relieved of having to pay for lodging and meals, therefore he was enriched. The majority thinks the question is one of convenience, but the real issue is whether the petitioner benefited financially. If it was necessary to live on the premises, occupancy at the Moana (another hotel owned by Hawaiian Hotels) would have been equally essential, yet he did not have living quarters or meals there. Aftermath Though this case established the important doctrine of \\"convenience of the employer\\", §119(a) of the tax code now has two other requirements that are needed in order to take fringe benefit exclusions for meals and lodging. First, it must be on the business premises. Second, in the case of lodging, it must be a condition of taking the job.

The French countered by arranging the assassination of Red Shoes. He was also known as Red Moccasin and was known in French as le Soulier Rouge.  Background  The Mississippian culture was a mound-building Native American culture that flourished in the Mississippi River valley before the arrival of Europeans. The Choctaw Indians once laid claim to millions of acres of land and established some 50 towns in present- day Mississippi and western Alabama. Their population was about 20,000 people scattered in these towns or villages. The peoples who became known as the Choctaws (Chahtas) originally lived as separate societies throughout east- central Mississippi and west-central Alabama and all spoke dialects of the Muskogean language. The nation, in fact, was a league of independent principalities in which the weaker towns were often attached as dependencies to the stronger. With European contact the world of the Mississippian culture turned upside down and nothing was the same. One leader, Red Shoes, moved to seize the opportunities offered by contact with the Europeans. The French of necessity had intimate dealings with the Choctaw from the time when Louisiana was first colonized, and the relations between the two peoples were usually friendly. But corruption, mismanagement and lack of supply eventually crippled the Indian trade of French Louisiana. The hunters came away from the trading table with little to show, sometimes even empty handed, after months of hard work to obtain the deer hides and furs. They were angry and disappointed. They naturally looked elsewhere and found better recompense in the Creek and Chickasaw camps of their former enemies. This meant they were actually trading with the English who had sent the Chickasaw and Creek against them. Their leader, Mingo Tchito, turned a blind eye, but he was infuriated when the French could not supply the customary chief's gifts. These developments led to an English party being formed among the Choctaw, partly because the prices charged by the Carolina traders were lower than those placed upon French goods. This effort was led by noted chief, Red Shoes, and lasted for a considerable time, culminating in his assassination and one of the principal Choctaw towns being burned to the ground before it came to an end with the defeat of the British Party in 1750.  Early life  Red Shoes began his adult life as a common warrior. He had no hereditary claim to Choctaw leadership. However, through his exploits as a daring warrior, he earned the distinction of the finest warrior the Choctaws ever produced. In later days it was said; \\"No one talked of anything but Red Shoes\\".Du Roullet to Maurepas, 1729 (Journal of Regis du Roulett, in Rowland Dunbar and Albert Sanders, eds., Mississippi Provential Archives French Dominion, 3 vol. Jackson Mississippi 1927 - 1932) I:33-34 As a youth Shulush Homa learned that it was necessary to cooperate with the French if one wanted to escape being taken into slavery by the large Chickasaw and Creek raiding parties. They had marched thousands into bondage for the English slave trade, killed thousands more and left the survivors to fend for themselves in a burned out, ravaged country.Struggle and Survival in Colonial America by David G. Sweet, Gary B. Nash Edition: illustrated. Published by University of California Press, 1982 , Water color painting by Alexandre de Batz. Choctaw, holding scalps, are painted for war. Early 1700s.  Leadership role  In the early 1720s the Choctaws waged a fierce war with the Chickasaws, their bitter rivals and enemies. After the taking of many Chickasaw scalps, Shulush Homa stood in Couechitto town and received a new name, Soulouche Oumastabe. Eventually he rose to Red Shoes or war captain of Couechitto. Red Shoes became his name. It was the highest rank a man of common birth could hope to obtain. He was in his twenties when he began his rise to power which paralleled the decline of the head chief of Couechitto, Mingo Tchito and the dismantling of Choctaw power structure. Though both Red Shoes and Mingo Tchito, were equally shrewd, Mingo Tchito lacked his young rival's boldness and willingness to gamble everything. Mingo Tchito always hedged his bets. It was a very dangerous game of survival these two played and Red Shoes emerged as the leader after a series of crisis plagued Couechitto after 1729. Red Shoes did not act defensively nor was he a pawn of the Europeans. When he went over to the English it was upon his own terms. He could be treacherous and ruthless, but to be less meant destruction in those dangerous times. Red Shoes, who hailed from the western division, opened trade with British fur traders based in South Carolina in the 1740s, their delegation being led by notable Indian trader and historian James Adair and ignited the Choctaw Civil War when he killed some French traders. These killings were not wanton. They were in retaliation for wrongs against the Choctaw, possibly including rape and murder.History of the American Indians by James Adair, pp. 143-145. When the South Carolinians intrigued with Choctaw chief Red Shoes to win his large tribe away from French alliance, the French countered by arranging Red Shoes' assassination.  Betrayal  In June 1747, a pack train bearing English presents from Charleston approached the Choctaw Nation. Red Shoes took a party to escort the traders to Couechitto. He never returned. On June 23, 1747, he felt sick and made his camp away from the main party keeping only one retainer. The man who volunteered for this duty was the man the French had bribed to kill him. As he slept, that man took out a knife, murdered Red Shoes for the French price on his head, and slipped into the night.History of the American Indians by James Adair, p. 149. In the aftermath of his assassination, more tragedy ensued as the event sparked the Choctaw Civil War. A substantial number of towns returned to the French, plunging the Choctaw into the ever-widening civil war. 800 warriors died in the ruins of their towns or in the woods where they were hunted down. Rivalries over trade with France and Britain caused the rift in Choctaw society, primarily between the western and eastern divisions, that lasted from 1747 to 1750. Eastern- division forces allied with France prevailed in the conflict and burned several western-division towns to the ground. Hundreds of Choctaws died during the war, which revealed deep divisions in the confederacy. Red Shoes had sought much more than personal gain. He had a vision that the Choctaws would benefit from the advantages the Europeans brought without falling under their rule. Retaining his independence, he made his own terms. He adapted, survived and prospered for a time. Even his death transformed the Choctaw Nation. After the conflict, Choctaw leaders worked to end inter-ethnic animosities and unite their peoples more closely.\\"Red Shoes\\", Mount Tabor Phoenix, Winter 2017–2018 issue, Official Newspaper of the Mount Tabor Indian Community By J.C.

In late antiquity it was also a bishop's see, and towards the end of Roman times it was mentioned as the capital of the province of Noricum mediterraneum. Today Tiburnia is a titular see of the Roman Catholic church.  History  Ancient Teurnia was situated on a wooded hill at the village of St. Peter-in-Holz in the municipality of Lendorf in the Lurnfeld valley, four kilometres to the west of Spittal an der Drau in Upper (i.e. western) Carinthia, Austria. As early as 1100 BC, people had lived there on Holzerberg hill, which may well have also been the centre of the Celtic Taurisci nationVia Michelin: Teurnia Excavations before c. 50 AD the Roman town was built with a forum, a market basilica, a temple on the city's Capitol, Thermae or public baths, terraced housing on two terraces, and a temple dedicated to Grannus, the Celtic counterpart deity of Aesculap, god of medicine and healing, but in Teurnia invoked as Grannus Apollo.Marjeta Šašel Kos, Pre-Roman divinities of the eastern Alps and Adriatic, Ljubljana: Narodni muzej Slovenije, 1999, p. 27 Usually older hill-top settlements were moved by the Romans to lower-lying areas with the one exception of the oppidum at Teurnia in the tribal region of the Ambidravi, where old names are said to have been retained and no renaming took place.Barley, Maurice Willmore,European towns: their archaeology and early history. Published for the Council for British Archaeology. New York: Academic Press, 1977, p. 265 Teurnia was one of the largest places in all Noricum with, in its peak period, a population of 30,000. Towards the end of the Empire the population decreased; people left the housing terraces, and the slopes being no longer suitable for agriculture were used as cemeteries. At the same time walls went up surrounding the hilltop with material from the deserted houses.  Ecclesiastical History  Bishop's church in Teurnia. Mosaic in the \\"Cemetery Church\\", discovered 1908 Mosaic border at altar By the 4th century, Teurnia was already a Christian town and it was a bishop's see until the city's decline and its end in 610. From the vita Severini by Eugippius of the year 511, we learn that Severinus, the \\"apostle to Noricum\\", was in contact with a bishop of Tiburnia/Teurnia by the name of Paulinus. From the fact that said Paulinus wrote admonishing letters to the communities of his see we may assume that he was the metropolitan archbishop of the province. Thus Teurnia may well be presumed to have truly succeeded Virunum as the provincial capital and Metropolitan archbishopric in the Migration Period. The last mention of the city and diocese of Tiburnia is from 591 in a letter of the Venetic and Rhaetic bishops. ;Residential Metropolitan Archbishops of Tiburnia/Teurnia (incomplete) * Paolino = Paulinus (482 – ?) * Leoniano (579? – ?) = Titular See = In 1968, the archdiocese was nominally restored as Metropolitan (the highest rank) Titular archbishopric of Tiburnia (in both Latin and Curiate Italian).

Excavations  Holzerberg hill was a well-known place of antique finds as early as the Middle Ages. Many spolias of buildings in the area come from here. Interest in the Roman finds increased duríng and after the Renaissance, but it took a long time until the ruins were identified as the city of Teurnia or Tiburnia known from antique sources. Professional excavations began with the accidental discovery of the cemetery church in 1908. The mosaic of its donor, the praeses or governor Ursus, in the right side-chapel of the three-naved basilica is in near-perfect preservation. In twelve pictures the mosaic shows christological, mythological and biblical symbols as well as the names of one Ursus, the donor, and his spouse, Ursina. In 1984, the Early-Christian bishop's church was discovered, which has now been roofed over and is open to visitors. The church walls have been preserved up to a height of six feet and show mural paintings. Excavations were also made along the southern side of the church, where a marble tablet and parts of a cross were unearthed. Earlier guesses had been that the bishop's church was beneath today's parish church, but from historic comparisons Franz Glaser, who is in charge of the Teurnia excavations, deducted the actual position along the western city walls. The episcopal church was built at the beginning of the 5th century and a century later, after a destructive fire, was rebuilt in basilica style with three naves and three apses. In analogy to the Hemmaberg situation in Lower (i.e. eastern) Carinthia, here too the bishop's church might have served the Catholic community, whereas Arians used the cemetery church for their services. In the village centre of St. Peter-in-Holz there is a recent \\"Römer-Museum\\" exhibiting numerous artefacts from the city area of Teurnia. Nearby are the preserved remains of a Roman town villa or villa urbana boasting a simple hypocaust in form of the letter Y. Next to the bishop's church the Hospitium, the bishop's guest house, was found, but for protection purposes it has been covered with soil again. More excavation work is going on. Information on the city's history and the excavation work is provided in display cases all over the area. Image:Teurnia Mosaik 01.jpgMosaic in Teurnia. Image:Teurnia Mosaik 02.jpgMosaic in Teurnia.

It is under the jurisdiction of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America and consists of a Camp and Retreat and Conference Center. In 1994 the Antiochian Village was the site of the Ligonier Meeting, an historical gathering of all Orthodox Christian Bishops in the United States which had never previously been done. Antiochian Village consists of two elements: A Retreat and Conference Center, and a Camp. The Antiochian Village also hosts other faith-based retreats, meetings and educational gatherings.  History of Antiochian Village  The Antiochian Village was founded by Metropolitan Philip of the Antiochian Archdiocese. Through his vision, leadership, and perseverance he established the \\"Village\\" as spiritual oasis spread over 300 acres. He dreamed of a place where children could meet, for an Orthodox Christian camping experiences, and where adults would come to refresh their souls, retreat, relax, join together in worship and grow closer to God. The grounds were purchased from Camp Fairfield, a Presbyterian camp, in 1978, and the first camping season was the summer of 1979. In his vision for this spiritual oasis, Metropolitan Philip desired to add a Retreat and Conference Center, monastery and retirement community to the already existing Camp. In 1985, the first phase of the Heritage and Learning Center, now known as the Retreat and Conference Center, was built with 50 lodging rooms, 6 meetings rooms, and a dining hall. In 1990 the second phase was completed with an additional 50 lodging rooms and several more meeting rooms. A new dining hall, now called the Cedars, was created. During the second phase of construction, a research Library was established to support the Antiochian House of Studies Program. Currently, there are over 21,000 volumes of theological research material, including a 1617 early edition of the King James Bible which was published just 6 years after the original version of the King James Bible. In 2004, the Antiochian Heritage Museum was built. The museum was established to foster understanding about Orthodox Christianity and Middle-Eastern Culture. The Museum offers exhibitions, films and speakers to further the greater communities understanding of the Orthodox Christian Church and the people of Antiochian heritage. The hope is that visitors to the museum may gain a greater appreciation of the history and theology of one of the oldest continuously functioning Christian communities in the world. The Heritage Museum intends to open channels of communication and understanding by exhibiting the remarkable contributions and artifacts found in the Antiochian Heritage. Retreat and Conference Center thumb The Retreat and Conference Center has one hundred lodging rooms, several meeting rooms, a group dining facility, a chapel and a theological research library. Saints Peter and Paul Chapel is the central point within the Center. In 2004, the Antiochian Village Heritage Museum was opened, featuring historical artifacts of Orthodox significance, such as icons and vestments. \\"The Village\\" hosts Orthodox Retreats, as well as, other religious church retreats and events to included Men's, Women's, Youth, Couples, Marriage, Family, and Church plenary sessions. Approximately 300 college students annual attend the OCF (Orthodox Christian Fellowship) College Conference East which is held at the Retreat and Conference Center each December. There is an annual SS Thekla and Raphael Pilgrimage every fall. St. Thekla is the patron saint of an outdoor chapel on the camp grounds, and St. Raphael of Brooklyn is buried just next to the outdoor chapel. The Antiochian Archdiocese has many of its ministry and organization meetings as well as its biennial Clergy Symposium at the Retreat and Conference Center, due to the central location and facilities that are conducive to host such meetings. The Retreat and Conference Center is also home to the Antiochian House of Studies. For more than thirty years, the House of Studies has been a “school without walls,” offering people throughout the world an empowering and enlightening theological graduate education. The House of Studies is physically headquartered at Antiochian Village under the leadership of the Orthodox Church. We service Christians from all walks of life. Past and current students have included people from the Eastern, Coptic, Antiochian, and Oriental Orthodox traditions. The current Executive Director of the Antiochian Village Conference and Retreat Center is Mrs. Amy Stiffler. And the current camp director is Fr. Christopher Shadid Camp The Antiochian Village Camp holds both a Summer Camp and Winter Camp each year. The Summer Camp consists of four 2-week sessions from June to August each year. More than one thousand campers between the ages of 9 and 17, as well as sixty staff, attend the camp every summer. Some main parts of the Summer Camp program are daily services in the St. Ignatius of Antioch chapel, St Thekla Outdoor Chapel and the various Shrines around the property, Christian education classes, a challenge course, an overnight camping program, and afternoon sports and activities. A 4-day Winter Camp for older campers (12 to 17 years old) takes place over long Presidents' Day weekend in February. Winter Camp has many of the same great elements of Summer Camp with the addition of a keynote speaker to address the campers on relevant topics, such as living as an Orthodox Christian in today's world. The camp also has a Family Camp for families to attend together over the Memorial Day weekend. Since 2006, there are \\"Sacred Arts Camps\\" during the summer for interested campers to learn Byzantine Chant and Iconography. In addition to St. Thekla and St. Raphael, the camp's patron saints include the child saint Artemius, St. Herman of Alaska, St. Marina, SS Sophia and her three daughters (Faith, Hope & Love), the Holy Youths and St. Ignatius of Antioch. The reliquary at the St. Ignatius Chapel includes the relics of St. Herman and St. Moses the Ethiopian. The Antiochian Village Camp has been accredited by the American Camp Association since 1982.

The town is in the eastern Ontario county of Lennox and Addington approximately 24 kilometers west of the city of Kingston, Ontario. The school offers classes for students in grades nine through twelve and is a member school of the Limestone District School Board. The school motto at ESS is Amor Doctrinae Floreat - \\"Let the Love of Learning Flourish\\" History The Odessa Continuation School that had serviced the community of Odessa for more than 40 years, closed in 1947. Ernestown Township then joined the Napanee and District High School area and with this change, area students were required to bus to the school in Napanee. In 1958, Reeve Erwell Huff, petitioned to allow Ernestown to withdraw from the school area of Napanee, which town council overwhelmingly endorsed. In September 1959, the first students were housed temporarily at the Township Hall and in a new cement block building erected in the town of Odessa. The student population was little more than 200 students. Ground breaking at the current site took place in 1959 and in 1960 Ernestown High School opened its doors at the present location. An addition to the school was made in 1965 with subsequent additions in 1969 and 1983. Sports The Ernestown Eagles compete in the Kingston Area Secondary Schools Athletics Association (KASSAA) with thirteen other area schools. Team colours are forest green and black.

While attending a NATO-sponsored English-language course in Hungary, Safarov had murdered an Armenian lieutenant who was also taking the course, Gurgen Margaryan, while Margaryan was asleep.

During his speech Ilham Aliyev noted: \\"I once said that the Armenian people should not be afraid of us, they should be afraid of their own leadership.\\" In 2008, Aliyev declared that \\"Nagorno Karabakh will not be independent; the position is backed by international mediators as well; Armenia has to accept the reality\\" and also stated that \\"in 1918, Yerevan was granted to the Armenians. It was a great mistake. The khanate of Iravan was the Azeri territory, the Armenians were guests there.\\" President Ilham Aliyev stated, \\"the occupation of the territory of the sovereign State with its internationally recognized boundaries – our territorial integrity is recognized by the United Nation and has been left out of due attention of the international community. All these facts are the ever seen injustice.\\" \\"No project can be carried out in the Armenian occupied Azerbaijani territories without the consent and participation of Azerbaijan.\\" On 20 September 2017, at the 72nd Regular Session of the UN General Assembly, President Aliyev reminded unexecuted UN Security Council Resolutions regarding Nagorno-Karabakh: \\"In 1993, United Nations Security Council adopted 4 resolutions demanding immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian troops from the territory of Azerbaijan. Armenia for 24 years ignores UN Security Council resolutions and unfortunately is not punished for that. In some cases, UN Security Council resolutions are implemented within days. In our case it’s 24 years that resolutions are not implemented. This is a double standards approach. This approach is unacceptable.\\" He reiterated the significance of international law for the resolution of conflict: \\"Armenia- Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict must be resolved on the basis of international law, relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Territorial integrity of Azerbaijan must be completely restored.\\" Public image * On 21 November 2009, Aliyev was included in the book 500 Most Influential Muslims of World. * Business Year company named President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev \\"The World\`s Person of the Year 2015\\". * In 2012, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project called Ilham Aliyev the corruptor of the year. *In 2012, CNBC filmed the film Filthy Rich about corruption which also mentioned the Aliyev family. * In 2013, 12 November President Aliyev received the State Medal of Honor of Turkey from Turkish President * In 2013, VIOAS (Voice of the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea) magazine declared President Ilham Aliyev as 'Man of the Year.'

Following the 2006 collapse of Clamor magazine, which was then handling Justseeds mail-order distribution, MacPhee sought to organize several artists with which he already had a working relationship into a cooperative entity that would expand to include other artists with equal stakes in the new project. Originally launched as Justseeds/Visual Resistance Collective in 2007, the name has since been shortened to Justseeds Artists’ Cooperative. Justseeds ran a distribution center, consisting of their online store and an internal archive, from the basement of a private home in Portland, Oregon from 2007 until 2010. In May 2010, operations were moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Organization Justseeds is a worker-owned, cooperatively structured business entity. However, the organization's internal structure is similar to many grassroots activist collectives in the U.S., with a concentration on consensus decision making. Although the business entity is registered in the state of Pennsylvania, where the shipping office for the internet store is located, active Justseeds members are spread across several locations within North America. Inter-cooperative communication happens primarily online, and mission-oriented discussions and project generation occur at occasional large group gatherings. Justseeds is usually identified as a collective organization of graphic printmakers, however individual artists within the organization also work autonomously from the group as educators, writers, sculptors, designers, and in puppet theater. Individual members have published books, fanzines, and other graphic works which are informally included within the Justseeds rubric, including the journal Signal (Dunn, Macphee, PM Press) and the Celebrate People’s History Book (MacPhee, Feminist Press 2010). Firebrands: Portraits from the Americas (Microcosm Publishing, 2010) was their first collective publishing endeavor. As of March 2020, the members of Justseeds are: Favianna Rodriguez, Josh MacPhee, Meredith Stern, Melanie Cervantes, Jesus Barraza, Dylan Miner, Nicolas Lampert, Jess X. Snow, Mary Tremonte, Thea Gahr, Roger Peet, Alec \\"Icky\\" Dunn, Pete Yahnke Railand, Shaun Slifer, Bec Young, Chris Stain, Colin Matthes, Molly Fair, Fernando Mati, Jesse Purcell, Chip Thomas, Kevin Caplicki, Kristine Virsis, Lesly Geovanni Mendoza, Mazatl, Sanya Hyand, Paul Kjelland, Aaron Hughes, and Erik Ruin.http://justseeds.org/about/ Much of Justseeds work is republished in newspapers and on websites following informal anti-copyright ethics. Justseeds members commonly respond to current social movements by producing free graphics for download and use from their website and blog. Collective projects Justseeds has collectively produced several print portfolios and collaborative art installations which differ from the individual members’ projects in that they are considered productions of Justseeds as a collective entity. In the case of the print portfolios, Justseeds regularly works with other outside, affiliated artists. * Voices From Outside: Artists Against the Prison Industrial Complex (with Critical Resistance, print portfolio, 2008) * In the Shell of the Old (collaborative installation, Space 1026, Philadelphia, PA, 2008) * Which Side Are You On?

Built about 1660, it is one of the oldest wood frame houses in Connecticut. Restored in the early 20th century by Norman Isham, it is now maintained by the East Lyme Historical Society as a museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Description and history The Thomas Lee House is located in southwestern East Lyme, on the south side of CT 156 just east of Rocky Neck State Park. It is a 2-1/2 story structure, with a post-and-beam timber frame erected on six 2-story wall posts, and covered by a steeply pitched roof with a large brick central chimney. Its exterior clapboards appear to be original. The main facade is five bays wide, with a regular arrangement that is offset to the right. The entrance is in the central bay, with flanking pilasters rising to a transom window and corniced entablature. The interior is indicative of the building's evolutionary construction history. Its oldest portion, probably built between 1660 and 1664, was a single-pile two-story structure with a side chimney. This was later altered by the addition of another pile on the opposite side of the chimney, and by the addition of a leanto to what had been its front, after a new road was cut to the north of the house. A small, stone-walled partial cellar pit under part of the hall was reached through a trap door. A massive fireplace with timber lintel spanned most of the west wall. Around 1700, the West Parlor and West Chamber were added as a free standing structure framed on its own four corner posts. About 1765, the lean-to with the Kitchen and its adjoining rooms were added. and by Thomas Lee II.http://www.eastlymehistoricalsociety.org/index_files/Page337.htm retrieved on 2017-08-25. The West Parlor was plastered, the summer beam and chimney girt were sheathed, and the paneling formerly on the plastered walls was reused in the lean-to. New paneling, with four flute pilasters was added on the fireplace wall. Thomas Lee House present day The house was built by Thomas Lee, the second of that name to own the land, and remained in the Lee family until the mid-19th century, when it was sold to a neighbor. It was used as a chicken house and for storage until 1914, when Lee family descendant banded together with the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities to repurchase the house. The house was given a painstaking restoration to its believed 17th-century appearance under the guidance of early preservationist Norman Isham, and was opened as a museum in 1915. Today the house is a historic house museum operated by the East Lyme Historical Society, and furnished as it would have been in the 18th century.East Lyme Historical Society website retrieved on 2018-03-14 See also *List of the oldest buildings in Connecticut *National Register of Historic Places listings in New London County, Connecticut ReferencesExternal links *Thomas Lee House and Museum - East Lyme Historical Society, official site * *Thomas Lee House & Little Boston Schoolhouse - local tourism information Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Connecticut Category:Houses completed in 1664 Category:Saltbox architecture in Connecticut Category:Museums in New London County, Connecticut Category:Historic house museums in Connecticut Category:Houses in East Lyme, Connecticut Category:Historical society museums in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in New London County, Connecticut Category:1664 establishments in Connecticut ","title":"Thomas Lee House"},{"id":"22765549","text":"Live!

Written by John Peel, The Gallifrey Chronicles is an exploration of the fictional history of the planet Gallifrey as revealed in the television series. It was published by Virgin Publishing in 1991. The Gallifrey Chronicles is a guide to the history, culture and technology of the planet Gallifrey, original home of the Doctor. It contains accounts of Gallifrey and the Time Lords as revealed in the television programme, speculative essays on subjects such as the mechanism of regeneration and the intelligence of the TARDIS, and The Black Scrolls of Rassilon, a fictional account of Rassilon's rise to power and the earliest days of the Time Lords. The cover art is by Andrew Skilleter who has illustrated several Doctor Who book covers.  Publisher's summary  The planet Gallifrey: cradle of the most ancient civilization in our galaxy, source of the technology that mastered both space and time, home of the people who call themselves the Time Lords — and the origin of the mysterious, quirky, itinerant time-traveller known as the Doctor. When the British Broadcasting Corporation transmitted the first episode of Doctor Who in 1963, no one could have predicted that the programme's popularity would ensure its survival for twenty-eight record-breaking years. In that first story we learnt only that the Doctor and his granddaughter Susan had left their home planet, under something of a cloud, in a remarkable time-travelling craft called the TARDIS that looked — at least on the outside — like a police telephone box. The Doctor and the TARDIS have remained the constant elements in a television saga that has seen many changes over the decades. As the years passed we learnt more and more about the Doctor's background, about other Time Lords, and about Gallifrey. John Peel has researched every DOCTOR WHO story ever shown on television to bring together all the facts about Gallifrey and the Time Lords. The result — illustrated throughout with photographs from the BBC archives — is a comprehensive guide to the foundations of the entire DOCTOR WHO Universe, and provides insight into the most comprehensive science fiction mythos that television has ever produced.

In the article, Stirling disagreed with the indication from Royal Court artistic director Dominic Cooke that the Churchill play needed no balance; the article stated that the Royal Court threatened legal action if Cooke's 'excuses' were read out onstage before the production of Seven Other Children at the New End Theatre. Further details of the correspondence appeared elsewhere. Like the Churchill play, Stirling's work is performed by nine actors and each scene is set within a period of recent history. In this play, however, the actors and the children they discuss are Palestinian.Seven Other Children,The Jewish Chronicle, John Nathan, 7 May 2009 http://www.thejc.com/articles/review-seven-other-children The original production was directed by Simone Vause.

It was released on January 12, 2010 on Capitol Records in the USA and EMI in the UK, and re-released on the band's independent label Paracadute Records on April 1. The album was produced by Dave Fridmann and was recorded in a span of seven months at Fridmann's Tarbox Road Studios in Cassadaga, New York. The compilation's name, lyrics, and concept are based on The Influence of the Blue Ray of the Sunlight and of the Blue Colour of the Sky, a pseudoscientific book published in 1876. Its style was noted as a significant departure from the power pop of their earlier albums. After the band's split with EMI and Capitol, Paracadute took over the promotional campaign and all distribution responsibilities. The compilation received generally positive reviews from music critics upon release and debuted at number 40 on Billboard 200 chart. Background After the band's previous album Oh No was finished being recorded in 2005, guitarist Andy Duncan left the band, citing creative differences and major label pressures. He was replaced by Andy Ross, who was involved in the album's promotion, including music video appearances. The music videos for \\"A Million Ways\\" and \\"Here It Goes Again\\" attracted much attention as viral videos on YouTube, and were significantly influential in the Oh No's success and rise in OK Go's popularity. Along with releasing the EP You're Not Alone with New Orleans brass funk rock band Bonerama in 2008, the band toured continually for almost three years in support of Oh No. Recording and production OK Go finished writing new material and started working in the studio in October 2008. They worked for two-week intervals (opposite The Flaming Lips) in producer Dave Fridmann's Tarbox Road Studios, a converted Amish barn in Cassadaga, New York, through May the following year. Bassist Tim Nordwind described the process of the studio sessions as a midpoint between the slick production work done on OK Go and the emphasis on live takes with the recording of Oh No. Concept and art Of the Blue Colour of the Sky's accompanying booklet presents the album as a concept based on an unnamed passage from The Influence of the Blue Ray of the Sunlight and of the Blue Colour of the Sky by General A.J. Pleasonton. The title of this book, proposing that blue is the essential life force, was adapted for the album because of the parallels between Pleasonton's faith in the color blue and Kulash's faith in the music that arises from him organically without rational thought.Weiss, Suzannah. \\"From MCM to Grammy: OK Go's Kulash '98\\", The Brown Daily Herald, Providence, February 5, 2010. Retrieved November 20, 2010. Elements of the booklet compare the lyrics with the passage, with data gathered from the characteristics of the texts presented by different graphical means. The image on the album cover was constructed with a list of twenty-five themes (for example \\"Unfounded or Wildly Broad Claims\\", \\"Wonderment\\", and \\"Light/Optics/Color\\"), each representing a specific color, assigned to each sentence in both the passage and the lyrics. If more than one theme is assigned to the same sentence, the colors are combined with additive mixing. With each sentence being represented by a colored line, the lines are arranged radially giving the impression of beams of multicolored light emanating from the center. Other data collected for presentation inside the booklet includes sentence length, parts of speech occurrences, syllable stress, and words common to both texts. Kulash, as the primary songwriter for the album, developed the concept and collected the data with Stefanie Posavec and Greg McInerny, who were credited with visualization and layout of the booklet. Re-releases Since OK Go split from EMI, their label, Paracadute, re-released the album with two bonus tracks April 1, 2010. On September 19, they announced that an Extra Nice Edition was to be released in the USA on November 2. It features the standard thirteen-track album along with a bonus disk that includes demos, alternate versions, two covers, and an in-depth interview with the band by Ira Glass. Also, access to a digital database is included with its purchase. Music will continually be added to the database even though the album is out. So far, a digital-only album entitled Twelve Remixes of Four Songs is available for instant download along with the two physical disks in Apple Lossless files or medium-sized MP3s. Reception Of the Blue Colour of the Sky received mainly positive reviews from critics, earning a 67 out of 100 score on Metacritic, based on 22 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Barry Walters of Spin said compared the album to the creativity of their music videos from Oh No, writing that it was \\"similarly ambitious\\" how the foursome applied the two contrasting genres of \\"Prince's sexy synth-funk and the Flaming Lips' elaborate dream-rock.\\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Chris Mincher contrasted the album favorably with OK Go's earlier output, describing a \\"darker atmosphere in which the band can release emotions other than goofy exuberance\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic writes that the album \\"ultimately seems diffuse\\" and that the \\"spaciousness expands as the album rolls on, eventually obscuring the hooks of the first half\\". Adam Conner-Simons of The Boston Globe writes that although \\"OK Go occasionally seems to be trying too hard...the album delivers some of the band's most fully realized compositions to date.\\" The video for the song \\"All Is Not Lost\\" was nominated for a 2012 Grammy Award for \\"Best Short-Form Music Video.\\" Track listing All songs credited to OK Go; actual writers listed below.
