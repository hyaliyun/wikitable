It is distinct from the more simple uses of selective focus which highlight or emphasise a single point in an image, create an atmospheric bokeh, or miniaturise an obliquely-viewed landscape. In this method the photographer is consciously using the camera to focus on several points in the image at once while de-focussing others, thus making conceptual connections between these points.  Limits to focus in imaging  rightthumbExample of tilted plane focus: here used for emphasis and metaphor, a 135mm lens at full aperture (f3.5) with extreme tilt and swing permits focus on specific details such as the foreground sack and slaughtered dingoes through to a section of the tennis-court mesh and the distant tethered goat. Shot on a 1963 Linhof Technica III 4\\"x 5\\" drop-bed field camera. (\\"Accomplices\\" 1994 James McArdle). Focus is relative to spatial depth. Selective focus in photography is usually associated with depth of field. A pinhole camera generates an image of infinite relative focus, from a point just outside the camera opening out to infinity. Lenses focus more selectively so that, for objects near the lens, the distance between lens and sensor or film is increased and is shortened for more distant objects, to a point beyond which all is in focus. In telephoto lenses this point may be tens or hundreds of metres from the camera. Wide-angle lenses distinguish differences in depth only up to a short distance, beyond which all is in focus.  Depth of field  Depth of field is an effect that permits bringing objects into focus at varying distances from the camera, and at varying depth between each other, into the field of view. A short lens, as explained above, will bring objects into focus that are relatively close to the camera, but it will also keep focus at greater distances between objects. A telephoto lens will be very shallow in its gamut of focus. Reducing the size of the aperture of the lens deepens the focus. At a pinhole size this will increase in effect, though the closer the objects are to the camera, the shorter the distance between focussed objects.  Plane of focus  Because focus depends on the distance between lens and the sensor or film plane, focus in the space in front of the camera is not on a point but rather on a plane parallel to the film plane.Faris-Belt, A. \\"The Elements of Photography: Understanding and Creating Sophisticated Images\\". Focal Press, 2008. , extract Spherical construction of lenses, rather than the ideal parabolic construction which is rarely and expensively achieved, means that this plane is slightly concave—more so in simple single element lenses and increasingly so with lenses of lower quality construction and materials. Compound lenses are built to correct this \\"spherical aberration\\" or \\"curvature of field\\".  Tilting the plane of focus  Tilt-lens photo of a model train, shot with a DSLR camera with a 1.6x crop factor. The lens was swung towards right, in order to keep the plane of focus along the train. The sensor plane, the lens plane and the plane along the train all intersect to the right of the camera. Varying the distance between the lens and sensor or film plane across the field of view permits focussing on objects at varying distances from the camera. One means of achieving this is to tilt the lens and/or the sensor or film plane in relation to each other. This will mean that individual points in the picture plane will focus on different points of depth, with the effect that the plane of sharp focus will tilt. This technique is based on the principle of Scheimpflug which, traditionally, is combined with small aperture to increase the gamut of focus beyond that achievable by depth of field alone. Usually no out-of-focus artifacts are desired in the image resulting from Scheimpflug adjustments. Here the converse is true. With the lens at full aperture, the photographer selects points in depth in the scene on which to focus and throws other points out-of-focus. This increases the contrast between the sharp and blurred areas and the selected application of focus and blur remains apparent to the viewer.  Tilted plane focus on smaller formats  A view camera permits full, incrementally calibrated control over this technique, though it is possible to achieve with other cameras and formats. It is possible to achieve similar effects on a 35mm camera or digital single-lens reflex camera (DSLR) using a special tilt-shift lens, or by manually holding a lens that is removed from its mount.  History  rightthumb\\"Prayer and Praise\\" Julia Margaret Cameron, British, Freshwater, Isle of Wight, 1865. Albumen print 11 1/16 × 8 15/16 in. Note that the camera in this instance is tilted down toward the scene from a point above the subjects' heads. It is this angle which has forced the plane of focus obliquely into the scene, and direction of the adult models by the photographer would be necessary to ensure focus where it is placed precisely on their eyes Julia Margaret Cameron was a strong advocate of this use of selective focus. For example, in \\"Prayer and Praise\\", produced in 1865, there is a deliberate placement of focus at more than three points: on the face and parts of the body of the foreground child; and faces of mother and father; while a second child's face is thrown radically out of focus.

Method of action The design, as patented, consists of nine fixed barrels attached to a limbers and caissons. The weapon was loaded with a cylinder containing nine rounds of ammunition, arranged so that the rounds lined up with the barrels of the weapon. A firing handle was then attached, which locked the cylinder into place. The weapon was fired by rotating the handle, with the barrels firing in sequence. By rotating the handle quickly a high rate of fire could be achieved, or slowly, single shots. Once the nine rounds of ammunition in the chamber were expended, the cylinder could be removed for reloading and a fresh cylinder could be inserted into the breech.

He is a midfielder. Wolleaston started his career with Chelsea, but he only made two first-team appearances in five years, and instead had short loan spells with Bristol Rovers, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth and Northampton Town. Following his release from Chelsea, he moved to Bradford City, but was released after one season, in which the club suffered relegation and administration. He spent more than a season with Oxford United but left following a series of injuries and instead dropped into non-league with Cambridge United, for whom he played 92 league games in three seasons, until he moved to Rushden & Diamonds in 2008. He played another 57 games at Rushden, and went on to have a short spell with Farnborough before moving to Weymouth. Career =Chelsea= Born in Perivale, London, Wolleaston started his career at Chelsea. He made his Chelsea debut in a League Cup against Huddersfield Town and made his second game in Premier League as a late substitute against Sunderland both in 1999. In March 2000, he was sent on loan to Bristol Rovers, playing four games, but failed to score or help Rovers to a victory. In August 2000, he was due to go on loan to West Bromwich Albion but instead opted to join Nottingham Forest on a similar deal for one month. Forest had an option to extend the loan spell for the season, but Wolleaston never appeared for the club. Instead in March 2001, Wolleaston was given another loan spell, this time with First Division Portsmouth, for the rest of the 2000–01 season. He made his debut three days later when Portsmouth defeated Stockport County 2–1, when Wolleaston hit the crossbar and was later replaced by match winner Steve Lovell. Wolleaston played a total of six games for Portsmouth, once as substitute, but failed to score. Wolleaston returned to Chelsea but again left on a loan deal ahead of the 2001–02 season, joining Second Division-side Northampton Town with fellow Chelsea youngster Sam Parkin. Wolleaston's debut for Northampton came on 18 August 2001 as they lost 2–0 to Stoke City, going on to make eight appearances in three months for the club, seven in the league, again without scoring a goal. He returned to Chelsea but never appeared in another first-team appearance in another two seasons. =Bradford City= Wolleaston played two reserve games for Bradford City at the end of the 2002–03 season, and in June 2003 signed a one-year deal with the First Division-side. He made his debut for Bradford in a League Cup tie with Darlington, which City lost 5–3 on penalties after the game had finished 0–0. His first league game came just over a week later as Bradford lost 1–0 to Gillingham. Bradford struggled for form and Wolleaston's first goal did not come until April when he gave the team hope in a crucial game against Derby County. However, Derby went on to win the game 3–2, which effectively ended City's hopes of avoiding relegation. City's relegation was followed by a fall into administration, and Wolleaston, along with Michael Branch and Mark Paston, was released from the club at the end of the season. He had played 15 games for Bradford, all but one of which was in the league, with his goal against Derby being the only time he scored. =Oxford United= He soon signed for League Two's Oxford United, who were managed by his former coach at Chelsea and Portsmouth, Graham Rix. Wolleaston made his debut for Oxford on the opening day of the 2004–05 as their new look side lost 1–0 to Boston United. He played 22 games during his first season with Oxford, with one each coming in the League Cup and Football League Trophy, and the remainder coming in the league, but he failed to score. However, his last game came in January against Bury, before he was first dropped and then suffered a series of injuries. He returned from injury in August 2005, ahead of the following season, but was immediately placed on the transfer list and never appeared for Oxford again. =Cambridge United= Wolleaston was released by Oxford in October 2005 and five months later joined Conference-side Cambridge United on a free transfer, initially on non-contract terms. He made his debut against Altrincham on 11 February 2006, in a 2–1 defeat, and a week later scored only the second goal of his first-team career as Cambridge reversed the scoreline against Southport. The following month he received the first red card of his career against Crawley Town. He helped Cambridge to a mid-table position during 13 games, and scored twice more, both in a 2–1 victory against Scarborough. Manager Rob Newman rewarded Wolleaston's good form by offering him a new contract to stay with Cambridge for the 2006–07 season. Wolleaston scored only one goal during his second season, in 35 league games for Cambridge, as they finished in 18th place, just four points above the relegation zone. He was rewarded with another one-year deal by new manager Jimmy Quinn, who called him \\"as good a midfielder as you'll see in this division.\\" Wolleaston showed his best goal-scoring form during the 2007–08, recording five goals during the league campaign. His goals helped Cambridge to two five-goal defeats of first Farsley Celtic, then Droylsden. He played 44 league games during the season to help Cambridge both to the third round of the FA Cup, where they lost to Wolverhampton Wanderers, and the play- offs of the Conference National. The first leg of the semi-final against Burton Albion ended in a 2–2 draw, before Wolleaston scored twice in the second leg to help Cambridge to a 2–1 victory, and a 4–3 win on aggregate. Cambridge faced fellow league-side Exeter City in the final, but were unable to win promotion back into The Football League, falling to a 1–0 defeat at Wembley Stadium. Despite signing a contract with Cambridge in January 2008 keeping him at the club until 2010, Wolleaston signed for Conference rivals Rushden & Diamonds for an undisclosed fee on 2 June 2008, with Cambridge manager insisting finances would be tight following a series of departures. Wolleaston had played 92 league games for Cambridge, scoring nine goals. =Rushden & Diamonds= Wolleaston made his debut for Rushden in a 1–0 victory against newly promoted Eastbourne Borough on the opening day of the 2008–09 season. His first goal for his new club came in his ninth game, on 20 September 2008, to help Rushden defeat Burton 2–1. Wolleaston's second goal for Rushden was the sixth of a 9–0 victory against Weymouth, who had been forced to field a youth team because of the club's financial problems which lead to the first team going unpaid for two months. The scoreline was Rushden's record-breaking victory. Wolleaston spent much of his final season with Rushden on the sidelines with a knee and calf injuries. =Farnborough= Wolleaston moved onto Farnborough on a month-by-month contract, but left in September 2010. =Weymouth= Along with Courtney Pitt, Wolleaston signed for Southern League Premier Division side Weymouth in September 2010 on a non- contract basis. He made his debut against league leaders Cambridge City on 18 September, with his new side losing 3–0. Both he and Pitt were reported to have made \\"polished displays in midfield\\". Wolleaston was rewarded with a contract keeping him at Weymouth until May 2012. Wolleaston was released by Weymouth on 5 September 2011, joining Harrow Borough soon after. In total, Wolleaston played 27 times in the league for Weymouth, netting four goals. =Harrow Borough= Having joined Harrow Borough in September 2011, Wolleaston became an integral part of the side making over 100 appearances in all competitions (98 in the league up to the end of the 2013–14 season). Wolleaston left Harrow Borough in the summer of 2014. Personal life Wolleaston has two sons and a daughter.

Alldis' contribution to UK radio is commemorated in the Radio Academy's Hall of Fame. Broadcasting career Barry Alldis, born in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, gained a music scholarship at Sydney University, becoming an accomplished pianist and trumpeter. He soon became involved in local radio, first as an announcer on Radio 2TM Tamworth and then as a disc-jockey on station 4BH in Brisbane. Alldis moved to London in 1955, first taking a series of odd jobs including that of nightclub pianist. In 1956 he became one of the small team of \\"resident announcers\\" at Radio Luxembourg's studios in Luxembourg City, broadcasting primarily to Britain and Ireland, although the station, boasting one of the most powerful transmitters in the world, was also heard across Western Europe. Radio Luxembourg's resident English team had to cover all the continuity announcing—of which there was a lot, since many of the sponsored programmes (pre-recorded in London, though this was never explained to the listeners) lasted only 15 minutes—as well as presenting several hours of live programmes per day themselves, largely based on playing records of popular music to fill up all the time not sold as sponsored programming, in practice usually the early evening plus the late evening through to the small hours of the morning. Alldis acquired the knack of somehow always sounding enthusiastic both about all the products he was required to \\"plug\\" in the spot commercials and about the record requests from listeners flooding into the station every day. Quickly promoted to Chief Announcer, he stayed in Luxembourg (where he married a local girl) for 10 years, and built up a considerable following throughout Europe: for many listeners in that era, Alldis was Radio Luxembourg. In 1966 he moved to London to work as a freelance disc-jockey and newsreader/continuity announcer, initially mostly for the BBC Light Programme and, after their launch in September 1967, for both the pop music station BBC Radio 1 and the \\"middle-of- the-road\\" station BBC Radio 2. (In fact the distinction between the two outputs was blurred for the first several years because they were merged for substantial periods of each day including for Alldis' Thursday edition of Late Night Extra.) In 1975 Alldis went back to Luxembourg and returned to the radio station where he had made his name. He quickly became one of the radio station's biggest audience draws once again, returning to Sunday evenings with the Top 20. He remained on air until his death in 1982 at the age of 51. Programmes Alldis presented many popular music programmes. He was best known for the weekly Top Twenty Show on Radio Luxembourg, which he anchored from 1958 until 1966. At the BBC he hosted numerous disc-based shows at different periods, including Monday, Monday, Newly Pressed, Swingalong, Late Night Extra, Album Time and The Early Show. Catchphrases * \\"Your DJ, B.A.\\" * \\"Whether at home or on the highway, thanks for tuning my way\\" Other achievements *Alldis was an occasional contributor to the weekly London paper New Musical Express.

Accessed 28 March 2012. __TOC__ History Based on a growing evidence base for the beneficial nature of antihelminthic treatment (deworming) in the early 1990s, the Partnership for Child Development was formed by the United Nations Development Programme and the Rockefeller Foundation within the Scientific Coordinating Centre at the University of Oxford. PCD is now based within Imperial College London's Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, in St Mary's Hospital, London, funded by international development organisations including the World Bank and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Organisational Focus PCD supports low-income countries to meet their school health needs using the findings of evidence-based research. PCD is a knowledge-based institution which creates and shares information. Core health interventions that PCD supports are school feeding & nutrition, deworming, water and sanitation, disability screening and health education. It conducts operational research showing how interventions can be implemented and evaluated at the country level, for example enabling mass treatment of children for common infections such as hookworm and bilharzia. PCD also facilitates the sharing of knowledge between academia, governments and agencies at both national and international level, through web sites, mailing lists and a global network of partners. In recent years, a major focus of this work has been assisting educators and health professionals to work together to help schools respond to the threat that HIV/AIDS poses to education, as well as supporting governments to better target orphans and vulnerable children in their child health programming. A major function of PCD is capacity building, by means of courses and workshops for governmental and non-governmental staff in developing countries. These include annual training courses in school-based health, nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia in partnership with local academic organisations such as Mahidol University, the University of Ghana and the Kenya Medical Research Institute. PCD are a core member of FRESH (Focusing Resources on Effective School Health), an inter-agency initiative that the group jointly developed with WHO, UNICEF, UNESCO and the World Bank. This initiative is a key guiding strategy for PCD's development work. References Further reading Jamison, D. T., J. G. Breman, A. R. Measham, G. Alleyne, M. Claeson, D. B. Evans, P. Jha, A.

It is one of the two oldest surviving bridges on the Thames, part Grade I and part Grade II*-listed. The bridge is in a rural setting, with a public house at either end: the Maybush Inn on the south bank and the Rose Revived on the other. The bridge consists of two spans. The northern span crosses the river and the southern span, south of the Maybush, is dry underneath except when the river floods. History The bridge dates from the 13th century and is built of Taynton stone in the same way as Radcot Bridge, which is slightly older. They were built by monks on the orders of King John in order to improve communications between the wool towns in the south of England and the Cotswold farms, and this was named \\"New Bridge\\" as it was the youngest out of the three bridges built at the time (the third being the Lechlade bridge, replaced in the 19th century). It was originally much longer than it is now, with 51 arches and being long, compared with the current 12 arches. Whether New Bridge or Radcot Bridge is the oldest bridge today across the Thames is debatable – Radcot Bridge was built earlier but was extensively damaged during the Wars of the Roses and had to be greatly rebuilt; furthermore, Radcot Bridge no longer crosses the main channel of the river since local reroutings in 1787. In 1644, in the Civil War, the Battle of Newbridge was fought on the banks of the river. Parliamentarian William Waller attempted to cross in order to surround Oxford and capture King Charles, but was defeated. In 2007 the area was flooded extensively. Current status New Bridge during the floods in the summer of 2007 The bridge is controlled by traffic lights, not being designed to carry modern traffic, and an weight limit is imposed to protect its weakening structure. Further reductions are considered likely by local authorities. According to a 1996 survey, one of the arches is only capable of carrying its own weight, though it was decided that there was enough leeway to allow traffic to continue across the bridge. The likelihood of collapse is considered \\"slim\\". In 2007, local authorities decided to enter into negotiations to buy land that could be used to build a new bridge upriver, believing that this is the only long-term option available. The idea of a new bridge is opposed by local residents of Standlake who would prefer to see the existing bridge remain open for light traffic only. In 2017, Oxfordshire County Council installed number-plate recognition cameras to protect Newbridge from overweight vehicles, the first time that ANPR cameras were used to enforce a road weight restriction in the county. The bridge has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration. The northern span is listed at maximal Grade I and the southern at Grade II*, the second-highest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\".

He was likely born at Kilfaughny, Athlone and lived in the vicinity.  Biography  Dillon was a captain in Wentworth's 'new army', which was recruited in Ireland to help put down a rebellion against King Charles I in Scotland. This force was disbanded after an outcry against arming Irish Catholics in the Parliaments of England and Scotland. When it disbanded in 1641 Dillon was authorised, with his own £1,000 (2009: £), to raise a regiment of the demobbed soldiers for the Spanish Army. However, this plan was interrupted by the outbreak of a Catholic rebellion in Ireland in October 1641. The brewing conflict lost him his investment and later that year he joined the revolt of his fellow Catholic gentry. Dillon is alleged to have conspired with Lord Maguire before the rebellion; he proposed seizing Dublin Castle but according to some accounts, the Earl of Ormonde, commander-in-chief, talked him out of it. However, the claim that Dillon and Ormonde (who was a Protestant) knew of the planned rebellion in advance has never been proved. After the outbreak of the rebellion in 1641 Dillon joined the rebels and participated in the alternative government the Catholics set up at Kilkenny in March 1642, under the name, the Confederate Catholics of Ireland. He was appointed governor of Longford and Westmeath by the Confederate regime. Dillon is recorded as a dove within the confederacy - favouring a speedy reconciliation with Charles I of England and Irish Catholic participation in the English Civil War on the royalist side. The question of whether to do this, or whether to achieve Catholic aims in Ireland by military force, against all the English factions, was a source of major division among the Confederates. Dillon was the dominant military leader in west Leinster and, as an infantry colonel, recruited and equipped over 1,000 men. Throughout 1642, Roger Jones, 1st Viscount Ranelagh held him off in Athlone. Ranelagh held the castle, west of the Shannon. Ormonde, by this time commander of the English royalist forces in Ireland, relieved the town without difficulty. In January 1643, at Rathconnell near Mullingar, Dillon attacked a second relief force as it returned to Dublin with the remnants of Ranelagh's garrison. His regiment assisted Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara in capturing Roscommon and Jamestown. In 1647 his regiment was destroyed, along with much of the Confederate's Leinster army, at the Battle of Dungan's Hill, when they were defeated by an English Parliamentarian army which by that time held Dublin. Dillon fought against the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland from 1649–51, when the English Parliament, victorious in the English Civil War, launched a renewed invasion of Ireland. In 1651 Dillon surrendered Athlone to the parliamentarians. = Family = * 8th (and youngest) son of Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon and Elranor Tuite. * His estate was in Mayo and Roscommon. * Married Elizabeth (died pre 1653) (Father: Thomas Plunkett of Rathmore, Meath) :* Sons Ulick and James predeceased him. * Married Mary (died pre January 1665); widow of Major John Ridge. :* No issue * His nephew Thomas Dillon, 4th Viscount Dillon inherited his estate References  * Dillon, Sir James; Dictionary of National Biography. :* J.

The baldachin is at the center of the crossing, and directly under the dome of the basilica. Designed by the Italian artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini, it was intended to mark, in a monumental way, the place of Saint Peter's tomb underneath. Under its canopy is the high altar of the basilica. Commissioned by Pope Urban VIII, the work began in 1623 and ended in 1634. The baldachin acts as a visual focus within the basilica; it itself is a very large structure and forms a visual mediation between the enormous scale of the building and the human scale of the people officiating at the religious ceremonies at the papal altar beneath its canopy. Context The form of the structure is an updating in Baroque style of the traditional ciborium or architectural pavilion found over the altars of many important churches, and ceremonial canopies used to frame the numinous or mark a sacred spot. Old St. Peter's Basilica had had a ciborium, like most major basilicas in Rome, and Bernini's predecessor, Carlo Maderno, had produced a design, also with twisted Solomonic columns, less than a decade before. It may more specifically allude to features drawn from the funerary catafalque and thus appropriate to Saint Peter, and from the traditional cloth canopy known as a baldacchino that was carried above the head of the pope on Holy Days and therefore related to the reigning pope as the successor of Saint Peter. The idea of the baldachin to mark Saint Peter's tomb was not Bernini's idea and there had been various columnar structures erected earlier. The old basilica had a screen in front of the altar, supported by 2nd century Solomonic columns that had been brought \\"from Greece\\" by Constantine I (and which are indeed of Greek marble). These were by the Middle Ages believed to have come from the Temple of Jerusalem and had given the rare classical Solomonic form of helical column both its name and considerable prestige for the most sacred of sites. Eight of the original twelve columns are now found in pairs halfway up the piers on either side of the baldachin.Ward-Perkins, J. \\"The shrine of St. Peter's and its twelve spiral columns\\" in Journal of Roman Studies, 42 (1952) p. 21ff. Description and history The old Solomonic columns mounted above the balcony (upper right background, against the wall) The bronze and gilded baldachin was the first of Bernini's works to combine sculpture and architecture and represents an important development in Baroque church interior design and furnishing. The canopy rests upon four helical columns each of which stands on a high marble plinth. The columns support a cornice which curves inwards in the middle of each side. Above this, four twice-life-size angels stand at the corners behind whom four large volutes rise up to a second smaller cornice which in turn supports the gilded cross on a sphere, a symbol of the world redeemed by Christianity. The four columns are 20 metres or 66 feet high. The base and capital were cast separately and the shaft of each column was cast in three sections. Their helical form was derived from the smaller marble helical columns once thought to have been brought to Rome by the Emperor Constantine from Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem and which were used in the Old Saint Peter's Basilica (See the article Solomonic column). From the cornice hangs a bronze semblance of the scalloped and tasselled border that typically trimmed the papal baldacchino. The structure is decorated with detailed motifs including heraldic emblems of the Barberini family (Urban VIII was born Maffeo Barberini) such as bees and laurel leaves. The underside of the canopy and directly above the officiating pope is a radiant sun – another emblem of the Barberini – within which is the Holy Spirit. The view from beneath the baldachin, showing the Holy Spirit within a radiant sunburst. The source of the bronze to make the structure was an issue of contemporary controversy as it was believed to have been taken from the roof or portico ceiling of the ancient Roman Pantheon, though Urban's accounts say that about ninety percent of the bronze from the Pantheon was used for a cannon, and that the bronze for the baldachin came from Venice. A well-known satirical lampoon left attached to the ancient ‘speaking’ statue of Pasquino on a corner of the Piazza Navona, said: Quod non fecerunt barbari, fecerunt Barberini or ‘What the barbarians did not do, the Barberini did’. At this early stage in their careers, and before the bitter rivalry between the two ensued, Bernini worked in collaboration with Francesco Borromini who made drawings of the structure and who may also have contributed to its design. Various other artistic colleagues were also involved including his father Pietro Bernini, his brother Luigi Bernini, Stefano Maderno, François Duquesnoy, Andrea Bolgi and Giuliano Finelli who contributed to the sculptural decoration. There remained an issue that Bernini was not to resolve until later in his career. In a Latin cross church, the high altar should be placed in the chancel at the end of the longitudinal axis and yet in St. Peter's it was located in the centre of the crossing. Bernini sought a solution whereby the high altar above the tomb of the first Pope of the Catholic Church could be reconciled with tradition. With his design for the Cathedra Petri or Chair of Saint Peter (1657–66) at the apsidal end of the chancel, Bernini completed his visual concetto or design idea; the congregation had a perspectivised view down the nave to the image framed by the baldachin which compressed the distance between the crossing and the Chair of Saint Peter in the chancel, reconciling the Prince of the Apostles' tomb, his implied presence on the Chair and his legitimate successor officiating at the ceremonies.Hibbard, 1986, pp. 160–162. =Plinths and the Barberini coats of arms= The coat of arms of the House of Barberini. Four marble plinths form the basis of the columns that support the baldachin. The two outer sides of each plinth are decorated with the Barberini family's coat of arms. This series of eight, nearly identical coats of arms forms a narrative that has attracted over the centuries the interest of writers and art historians. The coat of arms itself represents the three bees of the Barberini family. Each shield is enclosed by a woman's head at the top and by the head of a satyr at the bottom. A papal tiara with crossed keys surmounts the shield. All shields look nearly identical, but – if examined one after another starting with the left-hand front plinth – they reveal dramatic changes in the expression on the female face. The coat of arms itself, flat on the first plinth, undergoes a noticeable deformation, progressively bulging up to the sixth shield and flattening again on the last two shields. Above the eighth shield, the female face is replaced by the head of a winged child or putto. The allegory behind the coats of arms is universally interpreted as representing the various stages of childbirth. As Witkowski writes: Several explanations have been put forward for this unusually explicit allegory displayed in the most sacred place of Roman Catholic Christianity (the burial place of Saint Peter). Some scholars favor a symbolic explanation, suggesting that Bernini intended to represent the labor of the papacy and of the earthly church through the allegory of a woman's pregnancy. A more popular tradition tells the story of the complicated pregnancy of a niece of Urban VIII's and of his vow to dedicate an altar in St. Peter's to a successful delivery. A third tradition explains the allegory as Bernini's revenge against the pope's decision to disavow a child illegally born to his nephew Taddeo Barberini and the sister of one of Bernini's pupils. The childbirth sequence in Bernini's plinths was praised, among others, by director Sergei Eisenstein, who in a piece titled Montage and Architecture written in the late 1930s describes it as \\"one of the most spectacular compositions of that great master Bernini\\", with the coats of arms as \\"eight shots, eight montage sequences of a whole montage scenario.\\" See also *Index of Vatican City-related articles References ;Notes ;Citations ;Further reading * Lavin, Irving (1973?)

As a suffix it has been used extensively within Japan to define subcultural phenomena, though many zoku do not acquire the suffix (e.g. cosplay). A zoku may be labeled with a Japanese stem (e.g. kaminari zoku) or a foreign language (gairaigo) stem (e.g. saike zoku, where saike comes from \\"psychedelic\\"). As with the usual practice elsewhere, subcultures in Japan have almost certainly been labeled by an outsider to the group, often an influential person in the media.  Historic groups labeled as Zoku  =1950s/60s= Subcultures that emerged in the early post-war decades include the \\"motorcycle-riding Thunder Tribe (kaminarizoku), the amplified-music-loving Electric Tribe (erekizoku), and the Psychedelic Tribe (saikezoku).\\"Seidensticker, Edward. Tokyo Rising: The City Since the Great Earthquake. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1990. Although zoku was applied to others in society, like senior citizens, salarymen, and political activists (e.g. Uyoku dantai), it was mostly used to label youth subcultures. Shintaro Ishihara's 1950s novel Season of the Sun gave rise to a reckless and carefree expression of youth which became stylised in subsequent films as taiyo zoku (sun tribe). This subculture had some parallels with the rocker and greaser subcultures being promoted by Hollywood films such as Rebel without a Cause. Traditional Japanese considered the post-war taiyo zoku violent and promiscuous. Some Japanese youths admired American music, and Japanese Bill Haley clones were known as rokabiri zoku (the rockabilly tribe). At the height of the hippy movement and the psychedelic age in the 1960s, the futen zoku or vagabond tribe emerged in the Shinjuku area of Japan. Japanese media depicted them as dangerous because of their substance abuse and their public presence.Kwansei Gakuin More recreational drug users who patronized clubs and coffee shops were known as danmo zoku. =1970s/80s= A 1970s Japanese punk movement was known as karasu zoku (crow tribe) because they wore black clothing and accessories. Young women readers of the 1970s magazines \\"an an\\" and \\"non no\\" were known as the an-non zoku. In the 1980s, fashion became mixed with music and dance in the form of the takenoko-zoku or (bamboo-shoot tribe). This subculture was named after a boutique in Harajuku. Other parts of Tokyo such as Roppongi and Ginza have been centers of Japanese popular culture, and many zoku have been named after sites in these localities. Another very significant group of the 1980s was the kurisutaru zoku (crystal tribe), which were branded a social group after the success of the novel Nantonaku Kurisutaru (Somewhat Crystal). This label applied to youth who were swept up in the freedoms of the economic boom of the 1980s and became materialistic and conscious of their image, much like yuppies. They have been contrasted with the rougher groups that had existed since the 1950s. The Hanako zoku of the late 1980s was associated with a popular magazine for young women called Hanako.

It was miles long and connected coal pits at Tranent with the salt pans at Cockenzie and harbour at Port Seton in East Lothian, Scotland. The track was wooden, and wagons were drawn by horses. The Battle of Prestonpans in 1745 was fought across the line. It was converted to use iron rails in 1815, and was connected to the new main line North British Railway from 1846, later becoming superseded by a branch line of that railway. A section of the original line of route was still in railway use until 1968. Some of the route can be traced at the present day. History Map of the Tranent waggonway Before the eighteenth century, salt production on the shore of the Firth of Forth was a considerable activity; salt water was evaporated in salt pans. This required considerable quantities of coal, and this formed the largest demand for coal at this early date. While at the earliest date, it was possible to extract coal close to the salt pans, these deposits were soon worked out and coal had to be transported in from a more remote location. The landowner, the Earl of Winton, supported the Old Pretender in the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715 and as a result his estates were forfeit to the Crown. They were later acquired by the York Buildings Company of London, in 1719. Following a series of financial speculations, the Company became the largest in Scotland, but (because of the difficulty of communication in those days) it found it difficult to manage its business. It resolved the problem by leasing local businesses to tenants, providing incentives for them to improve their holdings. This resulted in improvements taking place at Port Seton harbour.Port Seton (or Port Seaton) harbour was a small exposed place a mile east of Cockenzie harbour. The waggonway connected the harbour to salt pans at CockenzieThe source which states that the Waggonway was connected to the salt works at Preston was written a century and a half after the waggonway was built - it is clear that the line only connected with the salt works at Cockenzie, on its way from the Tranent Pits to Port Seton Harbour. and the coal pits at Tranent. The cost of all the works was £3,500, completed in 1722. This original wooden railway followed a route along what is now School Lane in Cockenzie, before heading eastwards along the High Street to Port Seton Harbour.Title deeds from New Street in Cockenzie detail the precise route that the early waggonway took through the town to Port Seton Harbour. The later iron railway followed a different route at Cockenzie and headed to the western harbour at Cockenzie. Volunteer archaeologists uncovered there in 2017 a salt house, a wooden sleeper and some support blocks made from stone and presented their finds to more than 1000 visitors. On 1-8 September 2018 they found an intact turntable ring, salt pan flue system, remnants of a tipper mechanism, a 2.4m deep loading bay and datable pottery from the 1600s.Big Dig 2017.Big Dig 2018. Photographs of the waggons used (circa 1854) have been discovered at Cockenzie House, showing waggonway similar to Shropshire design being used.The photos of the Waggonway at Cockenzie Harbour in 1854 by Gen. Sir Robert Cadell, are some of the earliest photographs of a railway or waggonway in existence. They can be viewed at Cockenzie House. The railway used small wagons in short trains, and with the smaller track gauge this indicates the influence of Shropshire waggonway designs.Lewis says, page 255, \\"The traditional date of 1722 is probably correct: it was certainly before 1736.\\"M J Worling, Early Railways of the Lothians, Midlothian District Libraries, 1991, M J T Lewis, Early Wooden Railways, Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1970, George Dott, Early Scottish Wagonways, St Margaret's Technical Press Limited, London, 1947 Route of the Waggonway, near Tranent Church The track gauge was ; the wagons could carry one Scots chalder (30 cwt); the wagon ends were removable for unloading.Lewis, page 267 to 270 The installation was let to William Adam for £1,000 per annum. The rent was halved in 1733, reflecting Adam's lack of success in making a profit. He was unable to continue even at this lower rent, and he gave up the lease. Other tenants tried their hand, also without success. In 1745 the railway was the scene of part of the Battle of Prestonpans, during the Jacobite rising of 1745. The forces of Charles Edward Stuart, Bonnie Prince Charlie were advancing southwards, and the opposing forces of Sir John Cope brought them to battle. On 20 September 1745 Cope's troops and artillery ranged along the waggonway. Dendy Marshall says that they used an embankment formed for the railway as cover.C F Dendy Marshall, A History of British Railways Down to the Year 1830, Oxford University Press, London, 1938 Bonnie Prince Charlie cut through Cope's forces, and put them to flight. The York Buildings Company was sequestered in 1777, and in 1779 the former Winton estate was sold to the Cadell family. The offer for sale declared that: \\"There is still an extensive field of coal, whereof no part has hitherto been wrought by fire engine or other proper machinery. The whole of the coal lies at a small distance from the sea. The port and harbour of Seaton make part of the estate to be sold; and there is a waggon-way from the coal-pits to the salt-pans and the shore.\\"Caledonian Mercury: 19 December 1778 It was stipulated that: \\"The waggon-way is to be communicated to the purchasers in Lots 2d [2nd] and 3d [3rd] of Tranent, and a liberty reserved, on paying damages, to carry the waggon-way through the links of Seaton to the harbour of Port-Seaton, in the direction it formerly went, when the coal was wrought for the Company's account.\\"Edinburgh Courant, 23 December 1778, quoted in WorlingDeath of David Garrick. In: The Caledonian Mercury, 25 January 1779. Issue Number: 8951. Worling concludes: \\"Obviously, the lower part of the waggonway, as originally built, had been allowed to fall into disuse by the tenant... Clearly, in these early times, horses were used to haul the waggons. It may be that gravity was used in the downward direction, as happened later, but it is impossible to ascertain how free running the crude vehicles were. Even allowing for intervening changes in the landscape, an inspection of the route today reveals that the gradient on some parts of the route is slight, and in one place is even uphill against the general lie of the land (around Meadowhill).\\"Worling page 11 Robertson's earlier view is not entirely the same: \\"The line was built to give a steady downhill gradient to the sea, even though this required the construction of a substantial embankment, so that loaded trains of waggons could be sent down by gravity under the control of a brakesman, and horses would only be required for returning the empties.\\"C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722 - 1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, The line was single, with two passing places.

At about this time the waggonway was extended southwards to coal pits at Windygoul. In 1844 the North British Railway was authorised to build its main line from Edinburgh to Berwick. This opened in 1846, and it intersected the route of the waggon-way, which was provided with a bridge to carry it over the new line. Main line connection Also in 1846 the North British Railway secured an Act of Parliament authorising a branch from its main line at Bankton, a little to the west, to Tranent and Windygoul; the branch line opened in 1849. The line was relaid with wrought iron rails, probably in the 1850s. Cadell was able to take advantage of the construction of the main line railway, as it enabled his coal to be transported more cheaply; he arranged for transshipment sidings at both Meadowmill and at Windygoul. The track gauge of his waggonway prevented through running, and obviously a direct connection from the North British Railway was considerably superior. Transport of the coal by coastal shipping from Cockenzie Harbour naturally declined, and the lower part of the waggonway, north of the Meadowmill connection with the NBR, soon became disused and was later dismantled. The upper part continued to flourish, however, and for another 30 years it carried the Tranent coal down to the main line railway. About 1880 the coal merchant James Waldie took over the lease of the Tranent collieries and the waggonway. The waggonway was rebuilt as a standard-gauge railway with steam locomotives, and a junction was made with the North British Railway at Meadowmill. At this period Cockenzie Harbour was no longer much used due to the larger vessels then in use being unable to berth there, but for a period an exchange siding was made at Meadowmill, and the waggonway wagons were tipped into main line wagons for onward transport, generally to Leith. Twenty years later James Waldie and the other leading East Lothian coalmasters combined to form the Edinburgh Collieries Co. Ltd. The railway branch line, partly on the alignment of the earlier waggonway, was extended to Fleets Colliery. (Dott dates the \\"final uprooting\\" of the original line to \\"about 1896\\". The usage as a modern railway continued until the closure of Fleets Colliery in 1959. Above Meadowmill, a section of the original waggonway was subsequently used as a storage siding for National Coal Board coal wagons in the 1960s; this part of the route had therefore been in railway use for about 240 years. The present day Replica coal wagon No.45 'James Paterson’ in West Harbour Road, Cockenzie, 2018 The alignment of the original waggonway can still be discerned in places. Part of its length is used as a public path by walkers, cyclists, and horse-riders. There is a residential street in Tranent called The Waggonway (EH33 2QY). This is not on the line of the Tranent and Cockenzie line, but is near to the Windygoul pit on the extension. At Cockenzie Harbour, in situ stone sleeper blocks and a turntable cavity & loading bay were discovered in 2017/2018, and further discoveries made in 2019,1722 Waggonway found! by the 1722 Waggonway Heritage Group, formed in 2017 to preserve and promote the route as a heritage asset.

Two evolutionary grades are found in this family; micropredators (predators of very small organisms like aquatic insect larvae) and herbivores have a nonprotractile upper jaw and a deep to shallow body, while carnivores have a movable upper jaw and an elongated body. Although the herbivores primarily feed on plant material, these species often have omnivorous tendencies. The carnivores include specialized fish-eaters (genus Mesoborus), fin-eaters (Belonophago, Eugnathichthys and Phago) and species that will feed on both whole fish and fins (Ichthyborus). The fin-eaters attack other fish, even ones that are much larger, where they bite off pierces of fins with their sharp teeth.Lavoué, S.; M.E.Arnegard; D.L. Rabosky; P.B. McIntyre; D. Arcila; R.P.

He is also known as Humphrey O'Sullivan. He was deeply involved in Daniel O'Connell's Catholic Emancipation movement and in relief work among the poor of County Kilkenny. He was also an avid bird watcher and a collector of manuscripts in the Irish language. His diary, published later as Cín Lae Amhlaoibh, was kept between 1827 and 1835. It remains one of the most important sources for 19th-century Irish life and one of the few surviving works from the perspective of the Roman Catholic lower and middle classes. (A translation has been published in English and an abridged and annotated edition in Irish, both edited by Tomás de Bhaldraithe.) Ó Súilleabháin also composed verse and stories. Biography Amhlaoibh Ó Súilleabháin was born in Killarney, County Kerry. He came to live at Callan County Kilkenny, when he was nine years old, joining his father, Donncha Ó Súilleabháin. Father and son established themselves as teachers in the surrounding towns. They began by teaching under the hedges, but eventually a cabin was built as a school. Amhlaoibh took over the post of teacher there when his father died in 1808. He remained a resident of Callan until his death. County Kilkenny was at the time one of the most strongly Irish-speaking areas in Leinster. As a teacher, Amhlaoibh was well versed in mathematics and Latin, and is likely also to have taught English to a high standard. His diary shows him to have had a deep interest in the natural world, and there are daily references to the weather. Though he was clearly a master of English, his diary is mostly in Irish, with occasional business-related entries in English (probably so that such transactions could be verified by others). He mostly eschewed the archaisms favoured by other writers in Irish, writing in a fluent, flexible, colloquial style which could encompass both concision and literary elaboration. His diary shows him to have been deeply involved in the life of the poor but to have been well acquainted also with local notables. He was fond of occasional revelry and a good meal. He had an impressive collection of Irish-language manuscripts, both prose and verse, which were supplemented by books. As a businessman he dealt in linen, corn and meal, and often had to make long trips to Dublin (where he attended concerts), Clonmel and Waterford. He married a woman named Máire Ní Dhulachanta, not often mentioned in his diary. Her death, however, caused him great grief, and he never remarried. Legacy Amhlaoibh's original manuscript is currently in the possession of the Royal Irish Academy. An edition of the complete manuscript was published as Cinnlae Amhlaoibh Uí Shúileabháin by M. McGrath in 1936-37 and an abridged and annotated edition (Cín Lae Amhlaoibh) by Tomás de Bhaldraithe in 1970–1973. A translation (The Diary of an Irish Countryman) was published by de Bhaldraithe (Mercier Press) in 1979.

Like all Plasmodium species P. basilisci has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are reptiles.  Discovery and Description  The first description of Plasmodium basilisci was in 2 iguanids of the sp. Basiliscus family (Wiegman, 1828) According to Palaez and Perez-Reyes: \\"Plasmodium basilisci has been described from 2 iguanids of the sp. Basiliscus vittatus Wiegman, 1828, obtained from the surrounding lands of Laguna Encantada, San Andres Tuxtla (Veracruz) Mexico. One of the Basiliscus was kept in the laboratory for 2 weeks, during which time the parasites were studied in several dry-fixed blood smears with Giemsa's stain. The parasite was discovered only in erythrocytes, usually occupied a polar position in the cytoplasm and did not cause distortion or hypertrophy of host cells. [The] attempts to establish the parasite by intra-peritoneal inoculations with blood in 2 spp. of uninfected lizards (2 Sceloporus teapensis and 6 S. mucronatus mucronatus) were unsuccessful.\\" According to Nancy L. Herban and G. Robert Coatney, the following observation was made by Dr. Donald J. Pletsch on two Iguana iguana rhinolpha on April 28, 1968 in San Salvador: “The youngest stage noted was 2 µm in diameter with a red nucleus on the margin of the blue-staining ring-shaped parasite. Older forms were 4-6 µm in length and 3 µm wide and irregular in shape. The parasite was located in a polar position in the host cell. The nuclear divisions in the developing schizonts were scattered about with no regular shape to the parasite. In later stages they arranged themselves to compactly in a double-fan configuration about a single mass of dark brown pigment. The number of merozoites ranged from six to nine with an average number of seven. The size of the more mature schizonts was 3 by 6 µm. The female gametocytes were elongate, measuring 5 by 10 µm. The nucleus was pale pink and the cytoplasm light blue. There were six to eight grains of reddish to brown pigment usually located at one end of the parasite. The male gametocyte measured 4-8 µm and was shaped irregularly. The nucleus was reddish-purple and the cytoplasm stained mauve with the dark pigments in granules of different sizes scattered throughout the cytoplasm. The host cell was not enlarged and no displacement of the nucleus was noted. This species infects mature cells only. The parasite occurs in a polar position in the cell. The host cell is not enlarged and the nucleus is not displaced.\\". Today, it is known to be infecting reptiles only.  Distribution  This species occurs in Brazil, El Salvador and Honduras: Notes * Cyril Garnham found that a P. tropiduri parasite discovered by Fonseca to be P. basilisci but with eight merozoites per schizont.: Brazil, 1952. * Garnham described P. basilisci in the British Honduras in 1963. * Perez-Reyez found P. basilisci Pelaez, Mexican P. basilisci, in the blood of two Iguana iguana in El Salvador, Honduras in 1959. This type of P. basilisci was slightly larger and differed in the number of merozoites. According to Graham it functioned by paraziting proerythrocytes containing more merozoites than those in erythrocytes with its schizonts. * Gorgas Memorial LaboratoryInstituto Conmemorativo Gorgas de Estudios de la Salud scientists detected Plasmodium basilisci in Basiliscus vittatus and Basiliscus plumbifrons: Panama, 1964.

In 1762 the earliest of the Fuadaich nan Gàidheal (Scottish Highland Clearances) forced many Gaelic families off their ancestral lands. The first ship loaded with Hebridean colonists arrived on \\"St.-John's Island\\" (Prince Edward Island) in 1770, with later ships following in 1772, and 1774. In 1773 a ship named The Hector landed in Pictou, Nova Scotia, with 189 settlers, mostly originating from Lochbroom. In 1784 the last barrier to Scottish settlement – a law restricting land-ownership on Cape Breton Island – was repealed, and soon both PEI and Nova Scotia were predominantly Gaelic-speaking. It is estimated more than 50,000 Gaelic settlers emigrated to Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island between 1815 and 1870.

Pagan and Witherspoon hired John Ross as a recruiting agent for settlers willing to emigrate to Pictou with an offer of free passage, 1 year of free provisions, and a farm. The settlers (23 families, 25 single men) were recruited at Greenock Renfrewshire and at Lochbroom (Ross-shire) with the majority being from Lochbroom.

In 1992, the Ship Hector Foundation was formed from a group of volunteers in Pictou County and elsewhere who began to raise funds for the construction, maintenance and operation of a replica of Hector. The Hector Heritage Quay, along with the Ship Hector Company Store were opened on the Pictou waterfront in the ensuing years. The marine architect firm J.B. McGuire Marine Associates Ltd. was commissioned to research the particulars of the original Hector and to develop blueprints for an accurate replica. Scotia Trawlers of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia were commissioned to complete phase one and two of the construction at the Hector Heritage Quay, which allowed visitors to the Pictou waterfront to observe the ship's progress, making it an important local attraction.

It is a form of reciprocity. Redistribution differs from simple reciprocity, which is a dyadic back-and-forth exchange between two parties. Redistribution, in contrast, consists of pooling, a system of reciprocities. It is a within group relationship, whereas reciprocity is a between relationship. Pooling establishes a centre, whereas reciprocity inevitably establishes two distinct parties with their own interests. While the most basic form of pooling is that of food within the family, it is also the basis for sustained community efforts under a political leader. Sahlins argues that generalized reciprocity within families by elders may be a \\"starting mechanism\\" for more general hierarchy, by placing many in the giver's debt. This leads to the question, \\"when does reciprocity give way to redistribution.\\" Sahlins argues that chiefly redistribution is not different in principle and nothing but a highly organized form of kinship-rank reciprocity. Others, such as French Marxist anthropologist Claude Meillassoux, used the development of ranked kin redistribution from generalized reciprocity as the basis for a lineage mode of production found in western African chiefdoms and kingdoms. An elaborate example of this in a non-market society is the potlatch, where large amounts of personal resources are ceremonially given away to others in the community according to social status, with the tacit expectation that other members of the community would themselves give away large amounts of their own property in the future.http://anthro.palomar.edu/tutorials/cglossary.htm#potlatch Bähre argued that redistribution is a central mechanism in capitalist economies. In South Africa, many find themselves in a post-Fordist economy that is characterised by redistribution through the state (development aid, welfare), through markets (for example commercial insurance) and through religious institutions (neo-Pentecostal churches). In modern mixed market economies, the central form of redistribution is facilitated through taxation by the state. Redistribution of property therefore occurs where properties are allocated back to individuals or groups within society either through the provision of public services or directly through welfare benefits.

Motion Induced Blindness (MIB) is a phenomenon of visual disappearance or perceptual illusions observed in the lab, in which stationary visual stimuli disappear as if erased in front of an observer's eyes when masked with a moving background. Most recent research has shown that microsaccades counteract disappearance but are neither necessary nor sufficient to account for MIB. Overview Motion- induced blindness was originally discovered by Grindley and Townsend in 1965, followed by Ramachandran and Gregory in 1991. However it was given more attention and named when rediscovered by Bonneh, Cooperman, and Sagi in 2001. The researchers originally attributed its causes strictly to attentional mechanisms, seeing the visual system as operating in a winner-takes-it-all manner. Troxler's fading, discovered by Troxler in 1804, is a very similar phenomenon in which an object away from one's focus of attention disappears and reappears irregularly. There is no necessity for a moving background for this illusion to occur. Other similar phenomena in which salient stimuli disappear and reappear include binocular rivalry, discovered as early as 1593, monocular rivalry, and flash suppression. Causes The illusion catches the brain ignoring or discarding information. This may be one of the brain's useful tricks, a deficiency - or perhaps both. An ongoing debate regarding the causes of MIB is still present in today's vision research, however the purely attentional mechanism explanation has been rejected and new theories were put forward. =Interhemispheric Switch= There is a correlation between an individual’s switch rate during binocular rivalry and the rate of disappearance and reappearance in MIB in the same individual. This is most evident when the investigation involves an adequate sample from the 8-10X range of switch rates in the human population. In addition, TMS, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation interruption of the MIB cycle is specific jointly, for both the hemisphere receiving the TMS pulse and the phase of the MIB cycle, with the disappearance phase susceptible to interruption via Left hemisphere TMS and the reappearance phase susceptible to Right hemisphere interruption. In this way, MIB is like binocular rivalry, where hemispheric manipulations using caloric vestibular stimulation (or TMS) also require the correct combination of cerebral hemisphere and phase (1/4 possibilities). From these observations, it can be argued that MIB is an interhemispheric switching phenomenon, an unexpected member of the class of rhythmic, biphasic, perceptual rivalries such as binocular rivalry and plaid motion rivalry. In this formulation, the disappearance in MIB can be understood in terms of the cognitive style of the Left hemisphere, which chooses a single possibility from the many, and ignores or “denies” the others (denial being one of the characteristic defence mechanisms of the Left, which becomes exaggerated in the Left hemisphere bias of mania). MIB reappearance is attributable to the Right hemisphere, whose “discrepancy detector” cognitive style assesses all possibilities, and therefore disagrees with the biased decision to ignore the bright yellow stimulus. A corollary of this formulation is a predictable connection between MIB and mood, which was successfully tested on thousands of viewers watching ABC TV’s Catalyst Program in Australia, where longer disappearance phases were observed in euphoric individuals and very short, or absent, disappearances were a feature of the dysphoria of stress, trauma and depression. =Surface completion= Numerous psychophysical findings emphasize the importance of surface completion and depth cues in visual perception. Thus, if MIB is affected by these factors it will regulate in accordance to simple occlusion principles. In their study, Graf et al. (2002) stereoscopically presented a moving grid stimulus set behind, in front of, or in the same plane as the static dots. They then showed involuntary completion of the grid elements into a surface interacting with the static targets - creating an illusion of occlusion. When the grid appeared in front of the targets the proportion of disappearance was larger than when it was behind or on the same plane. Although to a lesser extent, MIB did nonetheless occur in the conditions where the perceptual occlusion was not taking place (targets were in front of the mask). The effect of interposition and perceived depth on target disappearance in MIB was also shown in a study done by Hsu et al. (2010) where a concave target appearing behind its surrounding disappeared more frequently than a convex one appearing in front of the mask. These effects, albeit being less significant, were replicated in similar settings without the use of motion. The above experiments show that surface completion and simple occlusion precepts can predictably modulate MIB. However. they do not explain the origin of MIB, and may only be evoking other processes contingent upon it. Moreover, the surface completion theory does not explain the role of motion in this phenomenon. =Perceptual filling-in= Hsu et al. (2004) compared MIB to a similar phenomenon of perceptual filling-in (PFI), which likewise reveals a striking dissociation between the percept and the sensory input. They describe both as visual attributes which are perceived in a certain region of the visual field regardless of being in the background (in the same manner as colour, brightness or texture) thus inducing target disappearance. They argue that because in both MIB and PFI the disappearance; or the incorporation of the background motion stimuli; becomes more profound with an increase in eccentricity, decrease in contrast and when perceptual grouping with other stimuli is controlled for; the two illusions are very likely to be a result of intermutual processes. Since MBI and PFI show to be structurally similar, it seems plausible that MIB can be a phenomenon responsible for completing missing information across the blind spot and scotomas where motion is involved. =Motion streak suppression= Rather than a deficiency of our visual processing, MIB may be a functional side effect of the visual system’s attempt to facilitate a better perception of movement. Wallis and Arnold (2009) propose a plausible explanation of target disappearance in MIB by linking it to the processes responsible for motion streak suppression. In their view, target disappearance is a side effect of our vision's attempt to provide an apparent perception of moving form. MIB shows to be hindered at equiluminance and augmented at the trailing edges of movement, all reminiscent of motion streak suppression. It appears that what drives MIB is a competition between a neural signal sensitive to spatiotemporal luminance and one responding to proximate stationary targets; where the stronger signal eventuates with what we actually perceive at any given moment (Donner et al., 2008). =Perceptual scotoma= A different explanatory approach by New and Scholl (2008) proposes that the phenomenon is another instance of our visual system's endeavor to provide clear and accurate perception. Because the static targets appear to be invariant with respect to the background motion, the visual system removes them from our awareness, discarding it as being contrary to the logic of perception and real life situations; thus treating it as a piece of disaffiliated retina or a scotoma. Consistent with this account is the fact that targets which are stabilized on the retina are more likely to be induced to disappearance than the ones moving across the retina. Implications MIB reveals that the brain uses mental models in order to process reality. The phenomenon also enables researchers to study consciousness, and attention with objective methods. As the phenomenon was discovered so recently, researchers have speculated about whether MIB occurs outside the laboratory, without being noticed as such. Situations such as driving, in which some night drivers should see stationary red tail lights of the preceding cars disappear temporally when they attend to the moving stream of lights from oncoming traffic may be case points.

In its strictest meaning, it acts grammatically as an answer to the question \\"how?\\" and explains the way in which the land was cut into straight bands that stretch from the shore to the highest points without ever stretching horizontally.

Origins =Significance of the terms used= Lame Very exposed to the south seas, Cap Méchant of Saint-Philippe is beaten by the lames (waves). The word lame here means a \\"more or less considerable movement of the sea due to wind action\\" or a \\"mass of water that rises up, shrinks from its crest, foams and breaks\\". Trésor de la langue française informatisé, s.v. Lame. It thus connotes a \\"wave of certain importance\\" Dictionnaire hydrographique international , s.v. Lame . like those one can easily see on a very regular basis on Réunion's shore. The island suffers from a geographical position that exposes it to strong waves with multiple origins. One of these is the trade winds and above all affects the leeward east coast. Another explanation is the absence of dry land between the south seas and the shores of the Sud sauvage (the southeastern part of the island), which means that the screaming sixties and the furious fifties (terms invented by mariners to describe the powerful winds between those longitudes) can reach Réunion without meeting any obstacle. A third reason is that this French Overseas department lies in the path of the tropical cyclones that arise in the centre of the Indian Ocean. Battant des lames The word battant as used here is not covered by any of the definitions given by the Trésor de la langue française informatisé.Trésor de la langue française informatisé, s.v. Battant. According to Le Français de la Réunion, a dictionary written by literature professor Michel Beniamino, this term in effect forms part of a noun phrase that takes on a particular meaning when it is associated with the word lames in the French spoken on Réunion. Thus, the battant des lames would be \\"the part of the coast subjected the action of the waves\\". Consequently, the meaning is close to what is called a foreshore in Metropolitan France. However, although Beniamino thinks that \\"seashore\\" is the best synonym, others consider that the terms are not equivalent. For instance, in a July 2002 dissertation written for the École supérieure des géomètres et topographes and titled Les Spécificités du bornage à l'île de la Réunion et leurs origines (\\"The Specifics of Partitioning on the Island of Réunion and Their Origins\\"), Yannick Smil posits that the seashore is less exposed to waves than the battant des lames.Yannick Smil, Les Spécificités du bornage à l'île de la Réunion et leurs origines , École supérieure des géomètres et topographes, 2002. Au sommet des montagnes High point of the island, the Piton des Neiges is not the sommet des montagnes (\\"summit of the mountains\\") referred to in the original expression. The montagnes to which the expression refers are the island's two mountainous massifs, that of Piton des Neiges and of Piton de la Fournaise. However, the sommet meant by the original version is neither of these two peaks. Rather, Grand Bénare was meant: when the expression was devised, it was far more familiar to the settlers. At the time, in fact, neither of the former two peaks had been approached. According to Bory de Saint-Vincent, the first ascent of the island's active volcano (de la Fournaise) came in the mid-18th century, while that of the extinct volcano (des Neiges) came even later. The expression itself dates to the beginnings of the island's colonisation, about a century earlier. Historical genesis =Original context= The exact origins of the expression have not been clearly established. However, it is certain that it was first used to designate the physical limits of the enormous parcels of land that the French East India Company granted to the French colonists who had just settled on the island's shores from the end of the 18th century. Thus, it is quite likely that it appeared in writing on the legal documents that the company had to draft in order to grant these concessions, a privilege that conferred upon it the status of royal factory. From the time Réunion started to be peopled, the island's entire territory was the property of the King. However, the first inhabitants settled wherever they liked, taking whatever land they wanted: there was room for everyone. It was only several years later that the East India Company expressed a desire to fix people's property lines so that they could cultivate the land more efficiently. Governor Vauboulon was the first to attempt to organise cultivation of the land and introduced the system of concessions. The first that can be found in the département archives date to 16 January 1690. =Logic behind the principle= The ravine Saint-Gilles and its waterfalls have served to delimit a concession since at least 1699. Very quickly, the concessions were divided among the assignees and the land was cut up into several lots. But on Réunion, throughout its history, it has clearly been Parisian customary law that has guided the rights of succession. It stipulates that goods are to be divided equally among all heirs, regardless of relative age or sex. Because the climate varied depending on altitude and thus there were differences in the potential value of the land, the property lines were drawn along the slope of the hills so as to benefit each descendant in a complete and equitable fashion: flat, easy-access land in the plains near the royal roads and the sea; land for farming and cultivation halfway up; and, a little higher, land planted with trees for building or burning. In turn, the intermediary level was divided in three parts, each with a distinct function: the lowest was used for subsistence farming, the middle for coffee plantations and the highest for animal husbandry. \\"Approche de la multifonctionnalité de l'agriculture à la Réunion. Les modèles agricoles, la relation agriculture- emploi et la perception des CTE par les acteurs locaux\\", Philippe Bonnal, Marc Piraux, Jean-Louis Fusillier et Dominique Guilluy, INRA, Cemagref and CIRAD The task of dividing plots perpendicular to the coast was made much easier by the fact that numerous ravines, difficult to cross, cover Réunion, starting from the heights and striating the sides of this cone-shaped island. Each lot might therefore be bounded by two torrents, \\"Quel espace public pour une jeune société civile ? Le cas de l'île de la Réunion (What Public Space for a Young Civil Society? The Case of the Island of Réunion) \\", Michel Watin, Les Annales de la recherche urbaine as is the concession stretching from the shore to the mountain peaks that Governor Jacques de La Cour granted to Chauveau et Grimaud on 10 February 1699 between Ravine Saint-Gilles and Ravine des Sables.Jean Dufos du Rau, L'île de la Réunion, 1960. The downhill flow of the water forms nearly incontestable natural bounds for the property. Implementation problems =Problems on the shore= The concessions that stretch to the highest summits were cut off from their sea edges at the beginning of the 18th century. Difficulties began when the authorities decided to set aside a fifty geometric-footstep zone along the island's shore. This restriction had not been formally stipulated in numerous prior deals: it was only as of 1736 that it was clearly mentioned during transactions. Indeed, it took a judgment of the Conseil Supérieur, dated 4 May 1765, to quash all objections and spell out with certainty the obligation to have a royal reserve along the coast. The establishment of this band around the entire island caused the expression to lose its initial meaning by distancing the lower limit of the concessions from the battant des lames. =Disputes up high= Since ravines were often formed by the union of several thalwegs upstream, the choice of which tributary to keep as the boundary marker between plots of land up high was not always easy and often led to disputes. This problem was aggravated by the fact that some of the ravines in question had several names, which made for a possible source of confusion. The question of what was meant by au sommet des montagnes was the most hotly debated. Although its meaning was clear in the Saint-Paul region, where the planèze (gently inclined volcanic plateau) is dominated by the Grand Bénare, the expression thereafter became a \\"style clause\\" used without any relation to the real situation in the regions where the landscape was more craggy. Thus, several possible meanings were debated: *The point that seemed highest, as seen from the shore. *The outside edge of the ridges of the cirques of Mafate, Salazie and Cilaos, the three depressions in the centre of the island. *The high point of the island, that is the summit of the Piton des Neiges. In 1830, Théodore Cazeau became the first to benefit from a distant concession in the middle of the island. He set up a home in Salazie in a place called Mare à Poule d'eau. What was at stake in this debate, which pitted the administration against the grantees at the end of the 1820s and the beginning of the next decade, was whether there remained land to be distributed. The authorities wished to open new concessions in the Cirque of Salazie, which was done in 1830, but also in the heart of La Plaine-des-Palmistes and of the Plaine des Cafres, which happened in 1834. The farmers considered that their parcels extended up to the summit of the island's highest mountain, so that all the concessions met at a single point. Since this latter interpretation did not correspond to the physical reality of the terrain, the administration created a new distinction between the expressions sommet des montagnes (\\"summit of the mountains\\") and sommet de la montagne (\\"summit of the mountain\\"), which it had hitherto used interchangeably. Thus, a judgment of the Conseil de contentieux administratif, issued 2 August 1853, defined the first as designating the high point as seen from several successive places, while the second referred only to the crest as seen in the foreground. A judgment of the Saint-Denis tribunal, issued 5 May 1856, then established that le sommet des montagnes was the crest in the background seen from the sea, and that there was no need to differentiate between use of the singular and the plural in the expression. This judgment was upheld by a ruling of the Cour de Bordeaux on 19 June 1867. Several years later, a ruling of 25 February 1874 ordered the amicable delimitation of the line of separation forming the high point of the concessions. However, the delimitation of the parcels did not follow this judicially ordered definition. It took an acquisition of summits by the government to put an end to the quarrel and fix the upper limit of the properties. Consequences =New units of measurement appear= This 2006 photograph shows how Dracaena reflexa could be used to show the concessions' limits. The relatively simple system of land distribution, made possible by applying the expression of the East India Company, allowed the landowners to dispose with legal measurement units: each owner could guess the extent of his property by looking at nature. Thus they only needed to plant distinctive species, such as Dracaena reflexa, to make the boundaries visible and make them known to the neighbours. The arpent (58.464 m), the unit of measurement employed in the first years of colonisation, fell out of use in several decades. In this context, new standards were ripe for appearance. Among these were the geometric footstep and above all the gaulette (4.872 m), an agrarian unit that continued to be used on a daily basis through the end of the 20th century. =Thinning, then concentrating private properties= Little by little as they were handed down, the strips of land became more and more narrow. Some were only a few metres wide by several kilometres long following the downward slope. Because of this, farming and access to parcels became more and more difficult. The pauperisation and relegation of part of the island's white population were due to the sugar crisis of the 1820s, '30s and '40s, and also to the growing irrationality of the smallholdings' shapes. This relegation led to the colonisation of the island's centre and of its cirques from 1830. The Petits Blancs des Hauts (poor, landless whites) were those areas' first permanent inhabitants after maroon slaves. However, the trend toward thinning the parcels was not universal. The vertical logic imposed by the formula of the East India Company was not immutable and rather quickly, in order to deal with demographic pressure, there started to appear horizontal boundaries cutting the original strips into several plots situated one above the other. In 1732, the surveyor Durongoüet was tasked with tracing four surveyors' lines parallel to the shore, at altitudes of 100, 200, 400 and 600 m. These lines, which correspond to the topographic notion of level curves, are still visible today, especially above the centre of Saint-Pierre, in the southern part of the island. Today these are navigable roads lined with houses that form evocatively named towns away from the centre: Ligne Paradis at around 100 m altitude, Ligne des Bambous at about 200 m, Ligne des Quatre- cents (\\"Line of the Four Hundreds\\") a little further and Ligne des Six-cents (\\"Line of the Six Hundreds\\") right at the top. In addition, according to geographer Wilfrid Bertile, some owners, usually making multiple transactions, were able to merge several properties and so form large domains that encompassed key parts of the island's land. In the second half of the 19th century, land concentration became extreme, to the benefit of a handful of private owners like the Kerveguens and of the several banks, such as Crédit Foncier. These squires, whether private or institutional, thus gained thousands, indeed tens of thousands of hectares. \\"La Réunion, département français d'outre-mer, région européenne ultrapériphérique\\", Wilfrid Bertile, Université de la Réunion, December 2000. This allowed some to consider that the application of the principle devised by the East India Company is what originated the control by ruling élites over all the lands of the island of Réunion. Le Manifeste des mosaïques. Whatever the case may be, the system founded on private property ended up dominating at the expense of the concession-based system, which was further threatened by the development of the colonat partiaire, a form of metayage specific to the French outre-mer, inspired by slavery and not abolished until 2006. These new forms of land occupancy signalled, when the ensuing transactions were made, an approach of economic opportunism rather than geographic logic. It was thus that the carving up du battant des lames au sommet des montagnes inevitably started to ebb. \\"Relation terre-eau dans les bassins versants ruraux. Action concertée de lutte contre l'érosion des sols à la Réunion\\", A. Hébert, G. Benoit et D. Groené, FAO, September-October 2000 =Initial carving up into communes= Since the creation of L'Entre-Deux commune in 1882, several communes of Réunion have been established, either not stretching du battant des lames au sommet des montagnes or having lost this characteristic by being cut up themselves. Population growth in each initial concession quickly led to the creation of an equal number of parishes by the Roman Catholic Church. The French Revolution transformed these parishes into communes. For several decades, the latter possessed the specific shape of the first concessions. All stretched from the ocean to the summits until the end of the 19th century. It took until 1882, when L'Entre-Deux was created, that the first commune of Réunion not stretching du battant des lames au sommet des montagnes was created: it did not reach the sea and its minimum altitude was around 100 m. France having become a republic, systematic hagiotoponymy (naming places after saints) was abandoned on that occasion. Thus, L'Entre-Deux became the first municipality whose name did not honour a saint. Since then, several other communes not respecting the principle of vertical division have been created: L'Étang-Salé, Petite-Île, Le Port and Saint-Pierre do not reach the mountains, while Cilaos, La Plaine-des-Palmistes, Salazie and Le Tampon do not border the coast. Today, although a majority of communes stretch du battant des lames au sommet des montagnes, other conceptions of territorial division than that promoted by the East India Company's expression have made their mark on Réunion. The traditional division of plots from seashore to centre has not prevented the differentiation of Réunion's territory into two qualitatively distinct zones. It has not stopped the development of a dualism between the island's Heights and lowlands, an opposition that the Parc national de la Réunion, opened at the beginning of 2007, tries to correct. L'île de la Réunion et le tourisme : d'une île de la désunion à la Réunion des Hauts et des Bas, Marie Gisèle Dalama, Belin, 2005 Change in meaning =Equivalents elsewhere= For all the reasons already indicated, the expression ceased to be used in its original sense rather soon after it appeared. However, it serves to designate the whole of the island of Réunion just as other expressions, more or less historical, stand for the whole of a country or continent: *\\"From Dunkirk to Tamanrasset\\" for France, when Algeria was part of France *\\"From the Atlantic to the Urals\\" for Europe *\\"From Cairo to Cape Town\\" for Africa; see the Cape to Cairo Railway Project *\\"From Alaska to Tierra del Fuego\\" for the Americas *\\"From Brest to Vladivostok\\" for Eurasia *\\"From sea to shining sea\\" (from the Pacific to the Atlantic) for the United States *\\"Malin to Mizen\\" is used to represent the whole geographical extent of Ireland *\\"Land's End to John o' Groats\\" is the traversal of the whole length of the island of Great Britain between two extremities *\\"A Mari Usque Ad Mare\\" (English: From Sea to Sea; French: D'un océan à l'autre) is the Canadian national motto Additionally, there are several non-geographical expressions that serve to evoke the totality of a physical entity by describing a bottom- up movement just like the East India Company's expression: *\\"From the cellar to the attic\\" to describe a whole house *\\"From the foundation to the roof\\" (De fond en comble) to describe the whole of a particular building. =Use since the 1970s= Economy The expression is particularly used by the local tourist industry in its advertising materials. The industry sees it as an easy way to encapsulate the special attraction of travelling to Réunion: access to the sea and the mountains in the same day. Literature In a 1972 work, the poet Jean Albany wrote that \\"the mountain starts to rise from the beating of the waves\\". Several months later, Catherine Lavaux used the expression in the title of a work: La Réunion, du battant des lames au sommet des montagnes (\\"Réunion, from the beating of the waves to the summit of the mountains\\"). The work appeared in several editions, the latest in 1998. La Réunion, du battant des lames au sommet des montagnes, Catherine Lavaux, 1998 Others An exhibition called Le long du battant des lames (\\"Along the seashore\\") was opened by the Confrérie des gens de la mer in February 2004 at Saint-Denis.

The population at the 2011 census was 668. It is located about northwest of Coventry and miles southeast of the village of Fillongley. The M6 motorway runs close by, and the village is familiar to motorists as it is the site of Corley Services. Other significant buildings in the area include Corley Hall, which was built in the 16th century. Half-a-mile east of the village lies the sandstone rock formation of Corley Rocks. Corley Ash is situated directly north of the M6 motorway, approximately 1.25 miles (2 km) northwest of the main village and 0.8 miles (1.3 km) southeast of Fillongley village centre. Corley Moor hamlet is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) west of Corley village, just south of the M6 motorway. Unusually, residences on the south side of Corley Moor lie within the boundaries of the City of Coventry, so it is split between two local authorities. The parish church of St Mary dates from the 12th century and is a Grade II* listed building. Corley is also home to Corley Cricket Club, which entered its 65th season in 2012. One of the club's most notable former players is James Ormond, who went on to represent England. The club has also seen many of its players compete at county level, including Race Williams and John Wilson, the latter representing Leicestershire young cricketers.

He served as the Member of Parliament for Aberdare, Wales from 1946 to 1954 and was the last former miner to represent the constituency. Early life He was born in Maesteg, the town to which his parents had moved from West Wales where his father had worked as a gardener in various country mansions. The family returned for a while to Cardigan and Cilgerran where Thomas received his early education. He subsequently returned to Maesteg and until 1906 attended school there. To his dismay, his father came home from work one day and announced that he had ‘had a start’ for him at the Oakwood colliery. His hopes for further education were thus dashed. David Thomas was employed as a clerk at three collieries from 1906–15. For five of these years he worked at Torycoed Colliery, Llantrisant. Anxious to further his education, he attended night classes in typing and shorthand. This training proved invaluable to him when, in later years, he attended meetings of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF). Thomas married Bessie, a teacher, in 1923. She died in September 1953. Early career In 1919 he was appointed a full-time Federation official at the SWMF office in Maesteg under Vernon Hartshorn, MP and Evan Williams, JP. Thomas joined the Labour Party in 1919 and was secretary of the Labour Party ward committee in Maesteg. When the SWMF office in Maesteg closed in 1934 Thomas was transferred to the Federation Office in Aberdare as Area Secretary and, in addition, fulfilled the duties of the Miners’ Agent, Noah Ablett, who was seriously ill. On the death of Ablett, he was elected Miners’ Agent, a role he fulfilled until 1946. He worked tirelessly and efficiently on behalf of the miners, dealing with such matters as compensation cases and the rights of the disabled miners. An active nonconformist, Thomas was an active member and deacon at Ebenezer, Trecynon. Parliamentary career In 1946, on the elevation to a peerage of George Hall, Thomas was chosen by the Aberdare Divisional Socialist Party to contest the vacant parliamentary seat. His maiden speech made in 1947 reflected his concern for the welfare of the miners; he spoke of the inadequate compensation for disabled miners and also the lack of other employment for those suspended from the industry due to injury.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/mar/10/economic- situation#S5CV0434P0_19470310_HOC_325 He pushed for the construction of factories in the mining areas. When elected MP in 1946, his majority was 17,125; this increased to 27,892 in 1950 and to 27,973 in 1951. He was a member of the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons and in 1949-50 was the leader of the Welsh Parliamentary Labour Group in the House.

It is located at 319 Main Road, Arnold's Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. History of the property Drake House was constructed in the 1890s in the community of Haystack, Placentia Bay. It was constructed by George Drake and his brother John. Frank Drake, George's son, inherited the property and lived in the building all his life. When Haystack was resettled Frank Drake refused to move, and remained in the house at Haystack for an additional 12 years. In 1969 the house was floated by barge from Haystack to its present site in Arnold's Cove. Frank Drake died in 2002, and was buried at Haystack. The oldest house standing in Arnold's Cove, the property has since been acquired by the Town of Arnold's Cove and has been restored. It now serves as a historical interpretation centre and community museum, and has housed demonstrations of traditional crafts such as knitting and quilting. The building was officially opened July 7, 2005. Construction type The house itself is of wood construction with a tar paper roof, and follows a standard Georgian central hall plan. On the exterior, the building features decorative woodwork on the corner boards and above the windows and central doorway on the main facade. Historical photographs indicate that the central doorway, with its original etched glass door intact, never had a bridge or stairway leading to it. The door then was probably never used as an entranceway, neither before nor after its relocation from Haystack. In 2016, it was noted: > There has been little change made to the interior of the building, and the > upstairs portion of the house in particular is well preserved. The interior > features a fine central staircase, unpainted wood trim, and largely > unpainted tongue and groove ceilings with wood medallions. Several original > pieces of furniture, a trunk of papers belonging to Frank Drake, old patent > medicine bottles, a bed with its original straw mattress, and many other > artifacts dating to the resettlement period remain in the building. Heritage designation The Drake House was designated a Registered Heritage Structure on March 27, 2003 by the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador.

The \\"Order of Saint Benedict\\" is not an incorporated body. Orthodox Benedictines enjoy good relations with each other, which frequently cross jurisdictional boundaries. \\"Monastic Orders\\" are not found in Orthodoxy, so Orthodox Benedictines are often known as \\"Orthodox Community of Saint Benedict\\" OCSB-Ro where the \\"Ro\\" refers to their lineage from Saint Romuald. Their Roman Catholic equivalents are OSB-Cam where the \\"Cam\\" refers to their Camaldolese lineage. History The Benedictine monastic tradition began with St Benedict of Nursia himself, who was a Christian monk in the 6th century. Influenced by the writings of Saints Basil the Great and John Cassian, he composed a monastic rule for the ordering of the life of monastic communities in Europe, rather than adopting one of the many rules that had been composed for monks in a different climate, with different foods available, and so forth. The liturgical traditions he enumerated conformed to the Roman Rite of the local church; which was then neither as elaborate nor as legislated as it later became. Most Benedictine communities existed in the West under what was geographically the jurisdiction of the Pope of Rome. After some centuries of increasing distance between Rome and the Eastern ancient Patriarchates (due to doctrinal, linguistic, and cultural differences, and the development of different schools of theology), the Western and Eastern branches of the Church separated, with the Western branch taking most of the Benedictine monastic communities. However, some Benedictines outside of the jurisdiction of Rome remained Orthodox, including monks of the Amalfion Monastery, which was a community of Benedictine monks from Italy who had come to reside on Mount Athos in the late 10th century, where they remained until the late 13th century. =20th century revival= The Benedictine tradition was largely lost to the Orthodox Church until the 20th century, when a revival was seen, encouraged by the efforts to restore the Western Rite to Orthodoxy that began in the 19th century. In 1962, under the leadership of its abbot, Dom Augustine (Whitfield), the Monastery of Our Lady of Mount Royal, which had been an Old Catholic monastic community since its founding in 1910, was received into the Moscow Patriarchal Russian Orthodox Church by Bishop Dositheus (Ivanchenko) of New York. It was later received into the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, in 1975, by Archbishop Nikon (Rkitzsky). In 1993, Bishop Hilarion (Kapral) of Manhattan (now Metropolitan Hilarion, First Hierarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia) blessed the founding of a new Benedictine monastery under its abbot, Dom James (Deschene), the former Prior of Mount Royal. Christ the Saviour Monastery (Christminster) runs an oblate programme that seeks the formation of clergy within the Western Rite of the Orthodox Church, a provision lacking in most Orthodox seminaries. It also publishes music and liturgical books to enhance the offering of the Western Rite Orthodox liturgy. In 1997, Hilarion (Kapral), then Archbishop of Sydney, received into the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia the monastery of Saint Petroc in Tasmania, Australia. This monastic community had been formed as a Continuing Anglican monastery in 1992 under its superior, Hieromonk Michael (Mansbridge-Wood). While it is not a Benedictine foundation it did have a Benedictine presence in the form of the Holyrood hermitage in Florida, which became an independent monastic hermitage under Abbot David (Pierce). One female Benedictine monastic house exists in the Orthodox Church, as attached to the Monasteries of Our Lady and St Laurence (Antiochian). Several Benedictine monastic houses, sketes and hermitages fit within the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, all stavropegial directly under the Metropolitan. An oblate programme exists for Orthodox laity Saint Benedict Russian Orthodox Church in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The Abbey of the Holy Name with its daughter house of St John the Theologian is under the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles. Within the United States, the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of North America has at least one Benedictine monastery, as well as parishes that run an oblate programme. Oblature The word oblate derives from the Latin oblatus, which means \\"one offered\\". Oblates of Saint Benedict offer themselves to God in much the same way that monks and nuns do, except that they do not take monastic vows or necessarily live within the monastic enclosure. Rather, they make a commitment to God, in the presence of the monastic community (or the parish community, depending on circumstances) to strive to live according to the Rule of St Benedict as adapted to their own life situations. Usually, the rule is adapted according to the individual spiritual and practical needs of each oblate by the abbot or oblate master of the monastery. Oblates may be male or female, celibate or married. They are not tonsured as monastics, and, unlike monastic vows, their oblation may be revoked at any time. They may be attached to a monastery, or the oblature operates on the parish level. Habit The Rule of St. Benedict does not stipulate a particular colour for the monastic habit, and the habit of unbleached, undyed, wool is not unknown among Benedictines. However, the colour most associated with the Benedictine tradition is black, (hence the name \\"black monk\\" used to refer to a Benedictine monk). The first layer of the habit is the tunic, which is secured by a belt. This is the form of habit worn by oblates during their novitiate. The next layer is the monastic scapular, which is a tabard-like garment worn over the tunic. The tunic, belt, and scapular, (with a head-veil for women), form the complete habit worn by oblates within the monastic enclosure and by monastics during the novitiate. Outside of the monastery, the oblates wear a reduced scapular and the Saint Benedict Medal under civilian clothing. When the monastic makes his solemn profession, he is tonsured and invested with the cowl. Monastics and oblates alike, upon their repose, are buried in the habit proper to their order.

Mission The mission of the 20th is to provide prompt, precise intelligence enabling warfighters to safely engage and achieve global objectives. The 20th processes and analyzes raw electronic intelligence data, and prepares both operational and technical electronic intelligence reports and studies. The 20th is organized into three flights: * The Target Material Flight produces precise coordinated measurements and mission-support materials for Air Force bomber, fighter and other airborne platforms engaged in exercise, training or actual combat operations. * The Combat Applications Flight activities entail providing direct application support for specified combat customers. This includes an AIA node for operational dissemination of near-real time imagery to Air Force and Department of Defense users worldwide. The Combat Applications Flight is also Air Combat Command’s point of contact for premission survivability and threat assessments, target analysis, weaponeering support and post-mission combat assessments for the Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile program. * The Operations Flight provides the day- to-day operating support to the other flights within the 20th. These activities are dispersed though branches who perform the activities of planning, requirements management, systems maintenance, logistics support and resource management. History =World War II= The squadron was originally formed as the 20th Photographic Mapping Squadron in mid-1942.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 107–108 In these early years, the unit worked under several different names and was stationed in the Pacific Theater as an element of Fifth Air Force. The units operated a variety of photographic reconnaissance aircraft in the South Pacific, engaging in combat reconnaissance. It moved to Japan in 1945, carrying out postwar reconnaissance and mapping of the Japanese Home Islands and Korean Peninsula as part of the War Department's Post Hostilities Mapping Project. It was inactivated June 1946 =Reserve and Korean War= The squadron was activated in the reserve in 1947 as the 20th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, a long range reconnaissance squadron. It was called to active duty during the Korean War at the start of May 1951. Its personnel were used as fillers for other United States Air Force units and it was inactivated two weeks later. =Cold War= 20th TRS McDonnell RF-101C 56-0183 at Shaw AFB, about 1960 The squadron was reactivated in the regular Air Force as the 20th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron in 1954 under the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Group as a Lockheed RF-80A Shooting Star reconnaissance training squadron at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. It upgraded to Republic RF-84F Thunderflashes in 1955. The squadron transferred to operational missions in 1959 with reassignment to the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing and re-equipped with McDonnell RF-101 Voodoos. The unit deployed to Florida in 1962 during Cuban Missile Crisis and flew tactical reconnaissance flights over Cuba during the Crisis. It returned to Shaw in late 1962. The squadron deployed to Tan Son Nhut Air Base, South Vietnam, 1963–1965 flying tactical reconnaissance in Southeast Asia. It was inactivated in 1967. =Intelligence operations= The squadron was reactivated and designated the 20th Air Intelligence Squadron under the newly formed Air Combat Command in 1992, at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. A year later, it was redesignated as the 20th Intelligence Squadron.

At that point, the deployment was scaled back from 2,100 to approximately 300, primarily concerned with security in Kabul, and manning the UK Afghan National Army Training Team (UKANATT). In 2003, the deployment in Kabul was expanded to battalion size when two Provincial Reconstruction Teams were established, along with a rapid reaction force, based around a light role infantry battalion, the Afghanistan Roulement Infantry Battalion (ARIB).

Modoc. Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture. 2009 (10 Feb 2009) They are descendants of Captain Jack's band of Modoc people, removed in 1873 from their traditional territory in northern California and southern Oregon after the Modoc Wars. They were exiled to the Quapaw Agency in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), where they were colocated with the Shawnee people from east of the Mississippi River. In the 1950s the federally recognized status of the Klamath Reservation (where other Modoc were colocated) and the Modoc was terminated, ending federal assistance to the two tribes. The Modoc tribe in Oklahoma reorganized independently and gained federal recognition in 1978. They have also acquired a land base and have introduced bison to their area. They have pursued several avenues of economic development in what was an inhospitable environment compared to northern California. Government The Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma is headquartered in Miami, Oklahoma and based largely in Ottawa County. Of the 250 enrolled tribal members, 120 live within the state of Oklahoma. The Tribe's Chief is Bill Follis, who was instrumental in securing renewed federal recognition in 1978 after the tribe's official status was terminated in the 1950s along with that of the Klamath Reservation.Scruggs, Patrica. The History of the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma. 2009 (10 Feb 2009) The Modoc tribal jurisdictional area falls within Ottawa County, Oklahoma. He also led the tribe in acquiring a land base. The tribe's government complex includes an archives and library, which is the only one in the area dedicated to Native American history and genealogy. Economic development The Oklahoma Modoc operates a housing authority; one casino, established in 1998 together with the Miami Nation; and Red Cedar Recycling, which has been open to the community since 1996. They manage the Modoc Bison Project as a member of the Inter-Tribal Bison Cooperative. They also issue their own tribal license plates. The casino, known as The Stables, is located in Miami, Oklahoma, and includes a restaurant and gift shop. Red Cedar Recycling provides free cardboard and paper recycling for area businesses and residents; they also pay the market rate for aluminum to recycle. The tribal company also provides educational materials about recycling and hosts tire recycling events.Red Cedar Recycling. Modoc Tribe Office of Environmental Quality. The tribe engaged in a controversial practice of \\"payday lending\\" by allowing a corporation to be formed under the tribe's name and legal status in order to bypass state usury laws. While the tribe maintains nothing illegal was done, the leader of the corporation, Scott Tucker was sentenced in January 2018 to over 16 years in federal prison and his company and others involved were ordered to pay $1.3 billion by the Federal Trade Commission. Today the tribe now independently engages in \\"payday lending\\" on a far smaller scale as a source of revenue. History The ancestral home of the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma consisted of some 5,000 square miles along what is now the California-Oregon border. While their tribal territory encompassed a small area, it was one of great biological diversity. On the west loomed the perennially snow-capped peaks of the majestic Cascade Mountains; to the east was a barren wasteland of alkali flats; towering forests of Ponderosa pines were to the north while the present-day Lava Beds National Monument, formed their southern boundary. Descended from indigenous cultures who had been in the region for 10,000 years, the historic Modoc were culturally unique. They spoke the Klamath language, as did the neighboring (and competing) Klamath people. Occasionally they formed war parties to drive out unwelcome visitors or raid neighboring tribes. The Modoc were hunters, fishermen, and gatherers who followed the seasons for food. They lived their lives in relative obscurity. The arrival of European Americans in the early 19th century changed their lives forever. The intrusion of fur traders, followed by European settlers into the Pacific Northwest, had a variety of social and economic effects on the Native populations. The Modoc bartered with fur traders for guns and horses, which they found necessary to compete with neighboring tribes. But eventually the traders and the prospectors gave way to farmers and ranchers, who competed for land and resources and had little regard for the Native inhabitants. These new American invaders traveled west in the mid-19th century by way of the Oregon Trail, which passed directly through traditional Modoc lands. The Modoc learned to live peacefully with the farming and ranching newcomers, often working for them and trading for livestock and other necessities. The flow of non-Indians into their ancestral homelands had an enormous effect on the culture of the Modoc people. They embraced many of the settlers' ways. Eventually they adopted clothing patterned after non-Indians with whom they socialized in the nearby town of Yreka, California. The Modoc sometimes used names given to them by the white man. Keintpoos became known as Captain Jack, while others became documented in American records as Scarfaced Charley, Steamboat Frank, Bogus Charley, Shack Nasty Jim, Long Jim, Curly- headed Doctor, and Hooker Jim. The increasing number of settlers needed more land to farm and to graze. As a result of the enormous pressure of white infiltration into Indian lands in California and Oregon, the Modoc, Klamath and Yahooskin Band of Snake tribes ceded their lands to the United States government and signed a joint reservation treaty in 1864. The Modoc agreed to live alongside the Klamath Indians, although these were traditional enemies. Life on the reservation was difficult. The more numerous Klamaths harassed the Modoc, and the Indian agent neglected them. The Modoc became increasingly frustrated. By 1865, Captain Jack led his band of Modoc off the reservation and returned to their territory of the Lost River (California) area of Northern California. The treaty signed in 1864 was not ratified by the US Senate until 1870. For two years Captain Jack refused to return to the Klamath reservation, requesting separate property on the Lost River for the Modoc. But with his band in violation of the treaty, the U.S. Army determined to capture the wandering Modoc and return them to the Klamath reservation in Oregon. The confrontation caused the explosive Modoc War. =Modoc War= With the outbreak of fighting, the Modoc warriors retreated with their wives and children to the nearby Lava Beds. They used the many caves for their defense and refuge. For almost six months, Captain Jack worked with his 57 braves to withstand an army that came to number over a 1,000 men. The military small arms were supported by mountain howitzers and coehorn mortars. Captain Jack lost only six men by direct combat while the U.S. Army suffered 45 dead. The latter included E.R.S. Canby, the only general to lose his life in an Indian war. The Modoc War is estimated to have cost the United States government, at least half a million dollars. Given the small number of warriors, this was probably the costliest Indian war ever fought. In comparison, the cost of land for the reservation requested by the Modoc on Lost River was estimated at $10,000. When the war finally ended on June 1, 1873 with the surrender and capture of Modoc, Captain Jack and five of his warriors, Schonchin John, Black Jim, Boston Charley, Barncho and Sioux, were charged with war crimes. They are the only Native Americans to be tried by a military commission on such charges. Gallows were constructed before the trial began, and it was evident the verdicts would be death by hanging. The date set for the execution was October 3, 1873. Captain Jack, Barncho and Sioux were convicted and sentenced to death. But just before the executions were to take place, the commission commuted the sentences of Barncho and Sioux to life imprisonment at Alcatraz Island in California. The men were not told of the change until after they, along with the other Modoc men, women and children were forced to watch the execution of Captain Jack. =Exile from Oregon= To solve the conflict between the Modoc and Klamath at the reservation, the US Commissioner of Indian Affairs decided to relocate the Modoc to the Quapaw Agency in Indian Territory. The Modoc were ordered to pack all their belongings for a long journey but were not told of their destination. On October 12, 1873, 155 Modoc: 42 men, 59 women, and 54 children, were loaded on 27 wagons and departed Fort Klamath, Oregon under guard of Captain H.C. Hasbrouck and soldiers of Battery B, 4th Artillery. A week later the large expedition stopped for the first time near Yreka, California. When they reached Redding, California, military guards took Barncho and Sioux away from the main group to prison at Alcatraz Island. The remaining Modoc were put aboard a train and housed in cattle cars. None of the people had seen a train before and were frightened of the noise and movement. They occupied four railroad cars coupled between two other cars filled with soldiers. Guards with loaded muskets stood at the doors of each car day and night. All of the men and boys capable of bearing arms were heavily shackled within the cars, adding to their distress. In this stage, they were transported to Fort D.A. Russell in Wyoming Territory. Nearing the fort, the Army officers received orders to take the Modoc prisoners to Fort McPherson, Nebraska. Finally arriving there October 29, Captain Hasbrouck turned his charges over to Captain Melville C. Wilkinson, US Army, Special Commissioner in Charge of Indian Removal. The prisoners were placed temporarily on an island in the Platte River, a few miles from the fort, where they hunted and fished for food. With the detour to Nebraska, the Modoc were forced to travel 2,000-miles during the cold of late fall, not reaching Baxter Springs, Kansas until November 16, 1873. The 153 Modoc men, women, and children arrived cold and hungry in this part of Indian Territory. In Baxter Springs, Captain Wilkinson conferred with Hiram W. Jones, Indian Agent at the Quapaw Agency, as to where to place the Modoc. They decided to locate the band on Eastern Shawnee land, to be supervised directly by Agent Jones. But Jones' Quapaw Agency had not been supplied with additional goods to outfit the prisoners: 153 persons with little but loose blankets on their backs. With Scarfaced Charley in command and only one day's help from three non-Indians, the Modoc built their own temporary wood barracks two hundred yards from the agency headquarters. Some were housed in tents. These accommodations were to be their home until June 1874 when the Office of Indian Affairs purchased 4,000 acres for their reservation from the Eastern Shawnee. The Quapaw Agency was located on Eastern Shawnee land in the northeast corner of Indian Territory now Ottawa County, Oklahoma. It was bounded on the north by the Kansas state line and on the east by the Missouri line. The Cherokee Nation formed its western and southern boundaries. The agency had been a sub- agency of the Neosho Agency until 1871 when they were jurisdictionally separated. The tribes constituting the Quapaw Agency were the Confederated Peoria, Eastern Shawnee, Miami, Ottawa, Quapaw, Seneca, and Wyandotte. Captain Wilkinson remained with his charges until the second week in December. When he left the agency, he reported to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, \\"on the cars, in the old hotel used for them at Baxter, I found them uniformly obedient, ready to work, cheerful in compliance with police regulations, and with each day providing over and over that they only required just treatment, executed with firmness and kindness to make them a singularly reliable people.\\" Agent Jones reported no difficulties in enforcing the strictest discipline, although one small area of friction had developed. Some Modoc gambled, resulting in some instances in losing what few possessions they had. When Scarfaced Charley, who had become chief, refused to interfere, Jones appointed Bogus Charley as chief. He served as chief until 1880, when the federal government ended formal Modoc tribal government in Oklahoma for almost 100 years, appointing officials through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. =Indian Territory= The first years following removal to Indian Territory were difficult for the Modoc. They suffered much sickness and many hardships due to the corrupt, cruel administration of Agent Jones. During their first winter at the Quapaw Agency, the government did not provide any food, clothing, or medical supplies to them. Jones and the Quapaw Agency did not receive funds for their support for nearly a year after their arrival, when $15,000 was allocated. Under such conditions, the death rate of children and the aged was especially high. By 1879, after six years at the Quapaw Agency, 54 people had died and only 99 remained of the tribe. By the time of the land allotments to Modoc households in 1891 under the Dawes Act, only 68 adults were left. Many had been born after removal. Especially in the early years, the people were highly dependent on their survival, on gifts of money and clothing from eastern charitable organizations, representing many people who were outraged by the government's treatment of the Modoc. During the 1870s the Office of Indian Affairs was rife with corruption; Indian agents were known to bill the U.S. Government for resources intended for the tribes, which were diverted to private sales. These so-called Indian Rings operated on a joint conspiracy between one politician, one Indian agent, and at least one local merchant. President Ulysses Grant tried to eliminate such graft by appointing religious groups and leaders to take over the Indian agencies. The Quakers, or Society of Friends, were prominent among the new Indian agents. The Quakers who were in charge of the Quapaw Agency in the 1870s were from the same Society of Friends who claim credit for successfully proposing the original Indian \\"Peace Policy\\" to President Ulysses S. Grant. Quaker Hiram W. Jones was the Indian agent at the Quapaw Agency when the 153 Modoc prisoners of war arrived there in 1873. He reported to fellow Quaker, Enoch Hoag, who was Superintendent of the Central Indian Superintendency headquarters in Lawrence, Kansas. As it happened, Agent Jones' wife and Superintendent Hoag's wife were first cousins. Grant's efforts to eliminate corruption did not succeed here. As historian Albert Hurtado wrote, \\"the Modoc were victims of a Quaker Indian ring that operated at the Quapaw Agency for nearly a decade during the 1870s\\". Of the 12 agency employees, 11 were relatives of Agent Jones or Superintendent Hoag. Soon after the Modoc were settled at the Quapaw Agency, Agent Jones restricted them from trading with anyone but a store next to the agency building; they were prohibited from going to merchants in nearby Seneca, Missouri. Superintendent Hoag's first cousin, T. E. Newlin, operated the store. When Seneca residents filed numerous complaints concerning the intolerable conditions suffered by the Modoc, their claims were dismissed by the federal government. Congressional representatives thought these represented disgruntled merchants who were bitter at being cut out of the lucrative Modoc trade. The Modoc mortality rate continued to climb. Because of persistent complaints by the Modoc and their non-Indian neighbors, Jones' Indian Agency was investigated by the Office of Indian Affairs in 1874 and again in 1875, but few changes and no criminal charges were made as a result. Following a third investigation in 1878, his system of nepotism and corruption was officially reported. Jones and his family members were described as receiving kickbacks from local merchants for the inflated prices and inferior quality of goods and services provided to the agency. It was not until 1879 that Hiram Jones and his family ring were relieved of their duties at the Quapaw Agency. The Modoc men and women persevered in adapting to survive. They worked at anything that brought income. The men worked on the farms of their white neighbors, and hauled materials and supplies to surrounding towns. The women sold their beadwork and intricately woven basketry. Both men and women worked in the fields. Soon they were cultivating their own land and continued to improve the condition and productivity of their farmlands and livestock herds. They were described as improving each year in assimilationist practices of dress, farming, house maintenance, and encouraging their children in reservation and other schools. The Quapaw Agency staff considered them superior among the tribes they supervised. During the Fall of 1874, Alfred Meacham, one of the four peace commissioners who had met Captain Jack during the Modoc War, visited the Modoc at Quapaw Agency. He was planning a lecture tour of eastern states related to his adventures during the war and tried to recruit men from among the Modoc. He received agency permission for Scarfaced Charley, Shacknasty Jim and Steamboat Frank to accompany him on the tour. The Modoc were very interested in obtaining an education for their children. Six weeks after removal, 25 of their children had started to attend the Quapaw boarding school some 12 miles north of the agency. Less than one year later, the children were reported as rapidly learning English, and many of the adults also learned to read and write. In 1879, the government constructed a building on the Modoc Reservation that served as both a school and a church. Several of the children later attended the Carlisle Indian School near Arkansas City, Kansas. However, after the death of Adam McCarty, a stepson of Schonchin John, at Carlisle, Modoc families were reluctant to send their children away to school. The Modoc also became active in the church established for them by the Society of Friends. By 1881, most had converted to the Quaker faith. Three of Captain Jack's warriors, formerly referred to as \\"blood thirsty and savage renegades,\\" became recorded ministers of the Friends Church. Steamboat Frank, who later took the name Frank Modoc, was the first full-blood American Indian to become a recorded minister of the Society of Friends. He was also the Modoc Church's first minister. To prepare for the ministry, Frank requested to attend Oak Grove Seminary in Vassalboro, Maine. While there, he became ill. Realizing death was near and wanting to return home to be with his only child, Elwood, he left the seminary. He traveled as far as Portland, Maine, where he died June 12, 1886. He is buried in the Friends Cemetery there. In 1891, the Society of Friends purchased the church building and relocated it to the current site on County Road S679 adjoining the Modoc Cemetery. The building was enlarged to include living quarters for the Friends missionary and his family. Services were conducted on Sunday and prayer meetings on Wednesday night. With a declining congregation at a time when some Native Americans were returning to traditional practices, in the fall of 1978, the Society of Friends held the last meeting for worship in the church. Termination and recognition The Modoc Tribe in Oklahoma was terminated under a congressional act in the 1950s intended to stimulate assimilation. Members of the tribe maintained an identity and applied to gain official recognition, which was successful in May 1978. This restored the tribe's special relationship with the federal government and made members eligible for Federal assistance. Among their early actions was the purchase of the Modoc Church and its four acres from the Society of Friends. They gained a grant from the US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development to restore the church. An additional $24,000 from the Oklahoma Historical Society made it possible to complete restoration of the church. The Modoc Friends Church and Cemetery were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, the first site so designated in Ottawa County, Oklahoma. Shortly thereafter renovation of the church began, and its dedication on June 10, 1984 celebrated the completion. In 1988, the Major William McBride Chapter, National Society United States Daughters of 1812, placed a historical marker at the church. The first marked grave in the Modoc Cemetery is inscribed as Rosie Jack, died April 1874. Rosie was the daughter of Captain Jack and his \\"young wife\\" Lizzie. Many of the leading participants of the Modoc War were buried in the cemetery in unmarked graves. The church and its cemetery symbolize the losses suffered by the 153 Modoc prisoners of war from the nineteenth century. Following the Nez Perce War with the United States, Chief Joseph and his people were forcibly removed from their homelands in the Northwest to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in 1877. Eight months later they were transported by train to Baxter Springs, Kansas. The weakened and sick Nez Perce could not complete the walk to the Quapaw Agency. The Modoc were hired as teamsters to transport the people to Modoc Springs on the reservation, where they set up a temporary camp. The Nez Perce did not remain long with the Modoc. Less than six months later, Jones had them transferred a few miles north to the Peoria Reservation. Eventually, they were transferred to the Ponca Agency in the western portion of Indian Territory; later they were moved to sites in Washington State and Idaho. Twentieth century and beyond Pursuant to the Act of March 3, 1909, the United States government allowed the Modoc to return to Oregon. Records indicate that 29 returned; however, several had gone back prior to 1909. Both the Modoc who returned and those who chose to remain in Oklahoma were enrolled at the Klamath Agency. As the years passed, the Modoc language, customs and culture were forgotten. The Modoc and Klamath tribes were terminated under the Indian termination policy from federal supervision by the Klamath Termination Act, or Public Law 587, enacted on August 13, 1954. At Congressional hearings during 1965, testimony showed the Modoc living in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri had not been properly notified that their tribe would be terminated simultaneously with the Klamath Reservation, as none of the public notices identified that the termination included the Modoc. Several years later all tribes in the northeastern corner of Oklahoma banded together to establish the Inter-Tribal Council, Inc. of Northeastern Oklahoma. At that time, the Modoc formed an unofficial tribal government. Bert Hayman, whose mother had been one of the youngest prisoners of war, became the first tribal chairman; followed by Vernon \\"Dutch\\" Walker, grandson of James Long, the \\"Youngest Modoc Warrior.\\" In a special section of the \\"Reinstatement Act\\" of 15 May 1978 reversing all of the Oklahoma Termination Acts it addresses the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma confirming that the provisions of the Klamath Termination Act did not apply to them except as provided for sharing in future claims against the United States.http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=92&page;=246 Bill G. Follis, great grandson of James Long, became chairman in 1973. When the tribe was granted Federal Recognition in 1978, Chief Follis became the first federally recognized chief of the Modoc in Oklahoma since the death of Bogus Charley in 1880. There were several Modoc chiefs at the Quapaw Agency after Bogus but they were only recognized as such by the Modoc people. Chief Follis, an avid horseman and rancher, continues to lead the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma. He was responsible for obtaining federal recognition for the tribe and reestablishing a tribal land base. The Modoc Tribal Complex, located at 515 G Street, S.E., Miami, Oklahoma was completed in the early part of 1982. The complex houses tribal headquarters, tribal archives and library. The library is the only one in the area dedicated solely to Native American history and genealogy. Chief Follis has also initiated numerous economic programs such as Red Cedar Recycling, opened to the community in 1996. In 1998, the Modoc and Miami tribes entered into a joint venture to establish The Stables; an off- track betting and high-stakes bingo establishment located next door to the Modoc Tribal Complex. Also, under Chief Follis' leadership, the tribe has reintroduced bison to the Modoc prairie with a thriving and ever growing herd. Today, the tribal office administers numerous federal and state programs that benefit tribal members, as well as other Native Americans in the area.

The design was essentially similar to revolver type pistols, with a rotating cylinder that held five or six rounds in a variety of calibers from .36 to .64 inches.floridareenactorsonline.com – Carbines, Revolving Rifles and Repeating Rifles, Robert Niepert They were mainly based upon the Colt Model 1855 Sidehammer Pocket Revolver developed by Elisha K. Root. Colt revolving pistols and rifles were attractive mainly because of their high rate of fire. They were used to a limited extent on the Pony Express, and made a brief appearance in the American Civil War.Army of the Cumberland and George Thomas Source – www.AotC.net However, the rifles were generally disliked by soldiers, and were ultimately discontinued due to serious design flaws.  History  Revolving rifles were an attempt to increase the rate of fire of rifles by combining them with the revolving firing mechanism that had been developed earlier for revolving pistols. Colt began experimenting with revolving rifles in the early 19th century, making them in a variety of calibers and barrel lengths. Colt Paterson 1838 ring-lever rifle Colt revolving rifles were the first repeating rifles adopted by the U.S. Government, but they had their problems. They were officially given to soldiers because of their rate of fire. But after firing six shots, the shooter had to take an excessive amount of time to reload. On occasion Colt rifles discharged all their rounds at once, endangering the shooter. Even so, an early model was used in the Seminole Wars in 1838. In March, 1836, Colt formed the Patent Arms Company and began operation in an unused silk mill along the banks of the Passaic River in Paterson, New Jersey. His first product was a ring-lever revolving rifle, available in .34, .36, .38, .40, and .44 caliber, in which a ring located forward of the trigger served to cock the hammer and advance the cylinder for each shot. This was soon followed with a revolving pistol. These five-shot \\"Paterson\\" revolvers featured folding triggers, and were available both with and without loading levers in .28, .31, and .36 caliber. Patent Arms produced smoothbore revolving carbines and shotguns. The outbreak of war between the U.S. government and the Seminole tribe provided Colt with his first break. Seminole warriors had learned that soldiers were vulnerable while reloading their single-shot firearms, and they developed a tactic of drawing fire, then rushing the temporarily defenseless soldiers and wiping them out before they could fire a second volley. Colt's revolving rifles were quite effective against this, and the army purchased his products for use by troops in the Florida campaign. In 1855, with his Model 1855 patent, Colt introduced a spur-trigger revolver that featured a fully enclosed cylinder. These handguns were officially named Sidehammer revolvers, but they also were known as \\"Root\\" revolvers after Elisha K. Root, who at that time was employed as Colt's factory superintendent and Chief Engineer. Based on the Sidehammer design, Colt produced the Sidehammer Model 1855 rifles and carbines for military and sporting use, as well as a revolving shotgun. In failing health, Colt expanded his factory on the eve of the Civil War, and began production of a new, lightweight .44 caliber Army revolver, followed a year later by a .36 caliber Navy version. This was produced in a rifle version as well as a shortened carbine. In 1855 it became the first repeating rifle to be adopted for service by the U.S. Military, but problems with the design prevented its use until 1857. The principal problem was that gunpowder would sometimes leak from the paper cartridges in field conditions, lodging in various recesses around the firing cylinder. Hot gas leaking from the gap between the firing cylinder and the barrel would ignite this powder, which would in turn, ignite all of the powder in the chambers waiting to be fired. This is known as a \\"chain fire\\" and was a relatively common failure with early percussion revolving firearms. When this happened with the Colt Revolving Rifle, a spray of metal would be sent forward into the left arm and hand of the user.George M. Chinn, The Machine Gun, 1951 A distrust in the weapon developed as a result. Commanders attempted to get around the problem in a number of ways. The rifle had to be properly and thoroughly cleaned, since sloppy cleaning would leave residue behind that would increase the risk of a chain fire. Some commanders instructed their men to fire the weapon only while supporting it directly in front of the trigger guard or by holding the lowered loading lever, which moved their left hand out of the path of danger during a chain fire. Other commanders instructed their men to load only a single chamber, preventing any chain fires from occurring. Loading a single chamber at a time also reduced the weapon to a single shot weapon, and effectively defeated the entire purpose of having a repeating rifle. Brevete Colt Dragoon revolving rifles were made in Belgium under license from Colt during the 1850s to 1860s.  Design and features  Colt Root Model 1855 rifle, cal.36, 2 Colt Model 51 Navy-revolvers, same caliber Colt Root carbines, .56 cal. The design of the Colt revolving rifle was essentially similar to revolver-type pistols, with a rotating cylinder that held five or six rounds in a variety of calibers from .36 to .64 inches. The Model 1855, which was the most widely produced revolving rifle, was available in .36, .44 and .56 caliber. Four barrel lengths were available: 15, 18, 21 and 24 inches. A six shot cylinder was used if the caliber was .36 or the .44. If the caliber was .56, a five-shot cylinder was used. A revolving rifle used percussion caps, like revolving pistols of the time. A cartridge (consisting of powder and a lead ball) was loaded into the front of the chamber and then compressed with a plunger that was located beneath the barrel. Once the cylinder's chambers were loaded, percussion caps were placed over the vent nipples at the rear of the cylinder. The weapon was now ready to fire. In addition to being susceptible to chain fire problems, the revolving cylinder design also tended to spray lead splinters into the wrist and hand of the user.\\"Civil War Firearms: Their Historical Background and Tactical Use\\" By Joseph G. Bilby Revolving pistols did not suffer from this problem since the user kept both hands behind the cylinder while firing a pistol. Some models could be fitted with sword or socket bayonets. The front sight would double as the bayonet lug for use with a socket bayonet, and those adapted for sword bayonets had lugs on the right side.  Use  A combination of Colt revolving pistols and revolving rifles were used on the Pony Express by the eight men who guarded the dangerous run between Independence, Missouri, and Santa Fe. When doubts were expressed about the ability of these eight men to deliver the letters on this run reliably, the Missouri government declared that \\"these eight men are ready in case of attack to discharge 136 shots without having to reload. We have no fears for the safety of the mail.\\" All mail deliveries on this route were completed safely.\\"American Rifle: A Biography\\" By Alexander Rose The U.S. government had purchased 765 Colt revolving carbines and rifles prior to the Civil War. Many of these were shipped to southern locations and ended up being used by the Confederacy. After the war began, the Union purchased many more rifles and carbines. Sources disagree over the exact number purchased, but approximately 4,400 to 4,800 were purchased in total over the length of the war. The weapon performed superbly in combat, seeing action with the 21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry Union forces at The Slaughter Pen while covering the withdrawal of Jon Millers Brigade during the Battle of MurfreesboroCozzens, Peter. No Better Place to Die: The Battle of Stones River. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1990, pp. 143. and Snodgrass Hill during the Battle of Chickamauga during the American Civil War. The volume of fire from this weapon proved to be so useful that the Confederate forces were convinced that they were attacking an entire division, not just a single regiment, but still, the Ohioans ran out of ammunition, and surrendered. Despite these victories, the rifle's faults would prove fatal for the weapon. A board of officers evaluated the evidence and decided to discontinue its use. The rifles were sold for 42 cents each, a fraction of the original purchase cost of 44 dollars. Many revolving rifles were purchased for the use of the militia of various states, and many militia companies entered the Civil War armed with them and never really used them in combat situations. The Colt Company made a number of sizes in the attempt to adapt the rifles to the various branches of the service. When used in the Civil War the soldiers in all branches of the service disliked them exceedingly on account of the flash and loud report so close to the face and dangerously strong recoil when several chambers went off at once.Sawyer, Charles Winthrop.

From left to right: Utermöhlen, Müller, Kruse Die Tödliche Doris (Deadly Doris; a pun on tödliche Dosis, meaning lethal dose) was a performance art and music group based in West Berlin from 1980 to 1987. It was founded by band members Wolfgang Müller and Nikolaus Utermöhlen and later joined by Käthe Kruse, Chris Dreier, Dagmar Dimitroff and Tabea Blumenschein. Biography Die Tödliche Doris was part of the Geniale Dilletanten (Ingenious Dilletantes) movement, a merger of the new wave and post-punk scene, which combined influences like Frieder Butzmann, Einstürzende Neubauten and Malaria!. The head of the band, author, musician and artist Wolfgang Müller, wrote the book Geniale Dilletanten (Ingenious Dilletantes) for the MERVE publishing house. This was known for the first German publisher of French postmodern philosophers. Rather than constructing a consistent identity, typically essential for pop music groups, Die Tödliche Doris challenged the notion of \\"convention\\" or \\"stereotype\\". Instead, they tried with each music piece and production not to follow a \\"style\\" or \\"image\\". Inspired by the post-structuralism of Baudrillard, Foucault, Guattarri and Lyotard, Die Tödliche Doris want to deConstruct ![sic] a sculpture, made by sounds. This musical, amusical or non-musical invisible sculpture should become the body of Doris itself. The first 12-inch LP of Die Tödliche Doris has no title, but is known as 7 deadly accidents in household. Afterwards they published the LP \\"Die Tödliche Doris\\" (1981). On this LP are 13 tracks, which seems to have nothing in common: a \\"funny\\" song followed by a \\"serious\\" song, followed by a \\"banal\\" one, a \\"cruel\\" one, a \\"soft\\" one, a \\"noisy\\" one etc. Nothing seems to fit together, all styles or themes are strictly separated from one another. So Doris consists - like human beings - of a lot of different, contradictory characteristics, which exist in one body, but not co- instantaneously. Because it is not possible, to re-enact this concept of a further LP, now the band begin to deConstruct the medium \\"vinyl-record\\" itself. With their following project, Die Tödliche Doris and her head, the philosopher and artist Wolfgang Müller broke the convention of a normal record-producing. Called, Chöre & Soli (1983–84), it looked like a five-vinyl- LP box, but contained eight small doll-records, a doll-record player with battery and a booklet. The songs lasted just 20 seconds and were of poor quality. This box is one of the most searched-for items among record collectors today. The plan of the band was that no reviewers would compare the music from their first LP with the second: \\"We want to become the most independent band of all independent bands–even independent from a usual record player,\\" Wolfgang Müller said in an interview: \\"But also independent from music-reviews and critics, which want to put you in her sound- and identity- system.\\" The band's fourth album, Unser Debüt (Our Debut), was perceived as a new wave pop album. It was published in 1984. This record played on popularity-seeking among other bands as a central musical theme. The music tried to sound \\"opportunistic\\", \\"ambitious\\", and overtly tried to \\"please\\" the audience. Doris-head Wolfgang Müller said, that this idea was born as a result of the coming-up atmosphere of becoming commercially successful, which has got since 1983 a noticeable influence of the West-Berlin Ingenious Dilettantes Scene around Einstürzende Neubauten, Malaria and others. Unser Debut received many bad reviews, though some writers in Belgium and Canada identified the music of the LP as \\"a parody about commercialism and conformance\\". One year later, the LP Sechs (Six) was produced, the musical opposite of Unser Debüt. It was very puritan, abstract music, artistic and hermetic. Many reviewers thought that the band had come back to their \\"experimental\\" roots again. In actuality, both records were recorded at the same time in the same studio at Atatak, Düsseldorf. Their tracks have exactly the same lengths on each face a and b. Unser Debut and sechs are full of relations between texts, sounds and contents. Also the covers relate and communicate in between colours, lyrics and images. But in public, nobody knows or find out, that both records a \\"fitting together\\". One year after Sechs was published, Die Tödliche Doris published a poster, where they announced having produced a completely independent, non-commercial record, \\"the first invisible record of the world\\", created in the head of listeners by playing the album Unser Debüt simultaneously with Sechs. Thus, Die Tödliche Doris created an additional, invisible 5th album in between Unser Debüt (their fourth) and Sechs (the sixth).

As a player, striker Taylor made over 500 league appearances, scoring 153 goals, the majority of which were for Cambridge United. Playing career Taylor started his career as a trainee with Colchester United in 1982 but he managed just one substitute appearance for the Essex club, in a League Cup tie. Dropping out of the league, Taylor took a job as a shipping clerk and played part-time for Sudbury Town F.C. where he was spotted by Cambridge United manager Chris Turner who paid Sudbury £1,000 for his services in the Summer of 1988. =Cambridge United= Taylor had joined a young team hungry for success and after a season on the fringes of the side, he quickly built up a partnership with Dion Dublin to forge arguably the club's most successful ever striking duo. From 1989 to 1992 Cambridge United embarked on an amazing run of success that culminated in successive promotions from Division 4 to Division 2. Much of this was down to manager John Beck and his controversial long ball methods. Beck had replaced Chris Turner as manager in January 1990 and had taken the club on a rollercoaster ride. Promotion from Division 4 was achieved via a play-off final win at Wembley over Chesterfield whilst the Division 3 Championship was sewn up a year later. Coupled with this were 2 successive FA Cup Quarter-final appearances with The U's being knocked out by Crystal Palace and Arsenal after some famous giant killing along the way. =Bristol Rovers= Cambridge United were top of the (old) Division Two in November 1991 and looking good for promotion up to what would be the first Premiership season in 1992/93. Beck's long ball tactics had become unpopular with the players however, including Taylor. Following 46 goals in total for the club he was surprisingly off-loaded to Bristol Rovers in March 1992. Rovers striker Devon White made the opposite move and United also parted with £90,000 to complete the transfer. It remains one of the most unpopular moves in the history of the club. United eventually made the play-offs but were beaten 6–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals by Leicester City and fans still wonder what might have happened had Taylor stayed – White played just once in the final run-in, failing to score. Taylor carried on where he left off for Rovers under their manager John Ward. He scored 44 goals in 95 appearances for the club before being sold to Bradford City for £300,000 after a proposed move to Middlesbrough fell through. A further 11 goals in 36 games followed at Bradford before Luton Town paid £200,000 to bring him back to East Anglia. =Luton Town= His time at Luton was a struggle and he suffered with injuries which contributed to his return of just 3 goals in 37 games. Loan spells at Lincoln City (who were now managed by John Beck) and Colchester United followed. Both were successful and both clubs wanted to sign him on a permanent basis. It was Cambridge United manager Roy McFarland that won the race for his signature however and he made a welcome return home to the Abbey Stadium on a free transfer in January 1997. =Back to Cambridge United= Taylor's playing career was resurrected at Cambridge. Playing with youngsters such as Trevor Benjamin, Martin Butler and Michael Kyd he was able to lend his experience and score some vital goals along the way. Taylor's goals helped United to promotion from Division 3 in 1999 and in total he went on to score a further 40 goals for the club, beating Alan Biley's long standing club record of league goals – Taylor finished his Cambridge career with 86 league goals for the club. Taylor had also been appointed Reserve Team manager after hanging up his boots and spoke of his keenness to one day go into management. Following Roy McFarland's sacking, John Beck was once again appointed to the club as manager and Taylor remained in his role with the Reserve Team. Beck's second coming was short lived and he was sacked in November 2001. Taylor expressed his desire for the job and after an initial caretaker appointment, the role was given to him on a permanent basis in January 2002, the resounding choice of the fans. Taylor's first game in charge was a 6–1 defeat at Tranmere Rovers and the season didn't get any easier as the club were relegated to Division Three. One highlight was an appearance in the final of the Football League Trophy where they played Blackpool at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, losing 4–1. Taylor steered United to a mid-table finish in their first season back in the basement division. The following season, he was awarded a testimonial game against Leeds United to recognise 10 years service to the club. Disappointment was just around the corner however. League form had been poor and Taylor himself had been forced to put his boots back on following the controversial sale of star striker Dave Kitson to Reading. The club's board were concerned that the club could be relegated from the Football League and made the decision to sack Taylor in March 2004, finally ending his long association with the club. Coaching career After a brief spell at Dagenham & Redbridge at the start of the 2004–05 season, Taylor became player- coach at Mildenhall Town. In August 2005 he joined Long Melford, becoming player-coach in November.Football: New role for Taylor Suffolk Free Press, 10 November 2005 He became manager of the club in February 2006.Long Melford FC BBC, 9 July 2009 In February 2007 he left Melford to become manager of Newmarket Town but was sacked just three games into the 2007–08 season. He returned to playing, rejoining Mildenhall Town and scoring the winner on his debut, a 1–0 Eastern Counties League Premier Division victory at Lowestoft Town on 8 September 2007. He later became manager of the club. In July 2011 he was appointed assistant manager of Walsham-le-Willows, also occasionally playing for the club.Rejuvenated John Taylor enjoying non-league life again Ipswich Star, 30 December 2011 He left Walsham in 2014 after having a heart attack.'I took selfies in the ambulance' Bury Free Press, 30 May 2014 Honours =Club= ;Cambridge United * Football League Third Division Winner (1): 1990–91 * Football League Division Three Runner-Up (1): 1998–99 * Football League Fourth Division Playoff Winner (1): 1989–90  References   External links  * * Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Sudbury Town F.C. players Category:Colchester United F.C. players Category:Cambridge United F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Bradford City A.F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Northampton Town F.C. players Category:Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. players Category:Mildenhall Town F.C. players Category:Long Melford F.C. players Category:Walsham-le-Willows F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Cambridge United F.C. managers Category:Long Melford F.C. managers Category:Newmarket Town F.C. managers Category:Mildenhall Town F.C. managers Category:Cambridge United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Association football forwards Category:English football managers ","title":"John Taylor (footballer, born 1964)"},{"id":"10752221","text":"Dick Joice (1921 in Great Ryburgh, Norfolk - 1999) was a British regional television presenter renowned in the East of England for his Anglia Television programmes - particularly the Bygones show that ran from 1967 for twenty years.Publishers’ Catalogue.

A farmer's son, Joice was educated at Culford School before taking over his father's tenancy on the Norfolk estate of the Marquess Townshend in 1940. It was a chance conversation with his landlord in 1958 that launched his career into television. Townshend, chairman of the new Anglia company, recognised that programmes for the farming community would be a vital part of the service and asked Dick to help. From 1959 Dick Joice presented Anglia's weekly Farming Diary as well as becoming the first host of the regional news magazine programme About Anglia in 1960. It was, however, his programme Bygones that had a tremendous impact in the region (despite being little known outside) and established him as a much-loved presenter.Screen Online biog. URL accessed April 18, 2007. Each half-hourly edition of Bygones explored East Anglian history and traditional crafts and featured mystery objects, about which Joice asked viewers, \\"Does anyone know what this was used for?\\" In two particularly memorable programmes (Horsemen and The Harvest directed by Geoffrey Weaver), Weaver assembled teams of men - some in their eighties - to demonstrate their now-lost skills with horses and in the fields. In his autobiography, Full Circle, Joice wrote that he ‘...was born with a naturally acquisitive and inquisitive nature, always wanting to find out how things worked and where they came from;’ and his own collection of bygone agricultural and domestic items was enormous.

The life and work of the Reverend Thomas Sockett of Petworth 1777-1859 The Hastings Press 2007 , sent around 1800 working-class people from the south of England to Upper Canada between 1832 and 1837.Moving Here, Staying Here: The Canadian Immigrant Experience at Library and Archives Canada - \\"Right of Passage: Debates\\" The Scheme was part of a larger initiative in Britain during the 1830s, in which churches, charitable organisations and private individuals were active in promoting emigration as a solution to overcrowded urban slums, unemployment and rural poverty in Britain. Background In the early nineteenth century malthusian predictions of overpopulation seemed to be true in Europe. The disappearance of bubonic plague after the seventeenth century and the introduction of smallpox vaccine in the later eighteenth century had allowed birth rates to exceed death rates in the young, giving population growth. There was no possibility of importing food from outside of Europe at that time, so food prices had risen, and with the decline in military employment after the Napoleonic wars unemployment and hunger were widespread in the countryside. Shelter and food for the destitute was provided locally by committees of landowners and clerics and varied from one area to another. Funding for this came from the Rates, a local property tax, which became higher with increasing poverty. In 1830 an outbreak of civil unrest by desperate agricultural workers, the Swing Riots, occurred in southern England, prompting the wealthy to look for a way of losing some of the surplus population, especially the more troublesome members, through emigration. Upper Canada was seen as somewhere with unfarmed land to settle and not too costly to reach, but far enough that people would not easily come back. The Petworth Emigration Committee Thomas Sockett was a moving force behind the scheme. From humble beginnings he had been tutor to the more important of the Earl of Egremont's many children, all illegitimate, and secretary to the earl. Encouraged by the earl he had graduated at Oxford University so that he could be ordained into the anglican church and become Rector of Petworth to give him an independent living. He formed a committee of three, with Thomas Chrippes and William Knight.Sheila Haines and Leigh Lawson, Poor Cottages & Proud Palaces. The life and work of the Reverend Thomas Sockett of Petworth 1777-1859 The Hastings Press 2007 p158 The earl was willing to pay the £10 per person cost of the voyage for those on his land, while the parish funds gave a further £10 for warm winter clothing, blankets and other supplies and equipment. Sockett used his network of wealthy contacts to recruit potential emigrants from across the southern counties of England, chartered ships and appointed supervisors to maintain discipline on the voyage and see the immigrants settled in Canada. To encourage further migration it was important that the scheme had a good reputation, so only good quality ships were hired. There were problems with the early supervisors and from 1834 to 1837 this task was undertaken by James Marr Brydone, a naval surgeon who had been at the Battle of Trafalgar. The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 increasingly interfered with local freedom of action, bringing a harsher regíme, as the Poor Law Commission said that other agencies could transport the emigrants more cheaply, and no more ships were chartered after 1837. The voyage The crossing by sailing ship took about seven weeks to Quebec, with very cramped living conditions, a six-foot square berth for three adults or six children. Cooking was done by the passengers using stoves on deck. Ships used included England, British Tar, , and Diana (1837). The voyage was longer but cheaper than going to the United States because the migrants were providing a return cargo for ships bringing timber to England. Ships would be towed up the St. Lawrence River to Montreal by wood-fired steam tugs. At Montreal the passengers had to transfer to barges known as Durham boats to ascend the St. Lawrence Rapids to Prescott before catching a steamer to Kingston, Ontario and Toronto (then still called York).Peter Jerrome, Petworth from 1660 to the present day. The Window Press 2006 p107 When the Rideau Canal was open the rapids could be avoided by using the Ottawa River and the canal. The people About 1800 people were sent to Canada by the scheme mostly from 1832 to 1837, although 170 went from 1838 to 1850 on ships of other agents. The emigrants consisted of unemployed single men and families dependent on a lone wage earner. Arable workers were more heavily represented than those working with livestock. They were seasonally employed and the series of poor harvests that culminated in the Swing Riots suggested poor employment prospects would continue. Skilled rural artisans and trades people were also represented in the Petworth emigrants. Although they possessed enough standing to be distinguished from agricultural labourers in status and wage, the seasonal nature of their work resulted in similar instability. As they made a good wage during the summer months, they were expected to make ends meet year round and were overlooked by the vestry when it came to off-season assistance. Former soldiers often did not settle easily into life back home and had the incentive of being entitled to claim 100 acres (40 hectares) of uncleared land, while other migrants were given five acres (2 hectares).Sheila Haines and Leigh Lawson, Poor Cottages & Proud Palaces.

The Sadriya market had already been struck by a massive truck bombing on 3 February 2007 and was in the process of being rebuilt when the attack took place. The bombings were reminiscent of the level of violence before Operation Law and Order was implemented to secure the Iraqi capital in February 2007. The attacks came as Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said that Iraqi forces would assume control of the country's security by the end of the year, and they also came as officials from more than 60 countries attended a UN conference in Geneva on the plight of Iraqi refugees. Bombings The first attack occurred when a bomb detonated on a minibus in the Risafi neighborhood of Baghdad, killing four people and wounding six. A parked car in the Karrada neighborhood exploded afterward, killing 11 and wounding 13. A suicide car bomber crashed his car into an Iraqi police checkpoint; the resulting explosion killed at least 41 people, including five Iraqi police officers, and wounded 76. One hour later, the deadliest attack was in the al-Sadriya market in central Baghdad, where a powerful car bomb killed at least 140 people and wounded 148, according to an Iraqi hospital official. The bomb was reportedly left in a parked car and exploded at about 1600 local time (1200 UTC) in the middle of a crowd of workers.

Since at least 2012 the ZRFAU has been in operational use on the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper drone.

Following investigations by activists http://espaivisor.com/exposicion/it-would-never-be-quite-the-same-again/ into EDO MBM's links with Israel, and the submission of documents showing these links as part of a defence of protesters, EDO MBM removed from their website a reference stating it was 'actively manufacturing' ZRFAUs, claiming this statement had been 'an error'. Directors of EDO(UK)Ltd, the holding company of EDO MBM admitted that a US subsidiary, Artisan Technologies, in New Jersey, did manufacture the component supplied to Israel. This subsidiary was 100% owned by EDO(UK)Ltd from 2000 until it was apparently sold in 2008 to its US parent company. Despite the sale of Artisan, EDO MBM continued to be the sole point of contact for sales and technical support for the component until 2012 when all references to the component were removed from the then parent ITT Exelis website. In November 2009 the Information Tribunal looking at EDO MBM's export licence applications held by the Dept for Business (BIS) found “There was no dispute that the ERU151 and the ZRFAU are components which can be incorporated into VER-2 bomb racks for use with F-16 combat aircraft, that those aircraft are used by the Israeli air force, and that from 1998 EDO owned the right to manufacture the ERU151 and the ZRFAU.'\\" But \\"After examining the documents, it concluded the information did not confirm claims that EDO supplied Israel, and therefore the documents should remain confidential.EDO MBM's involvement with the design, development, technical support and supply of the ZRFAU had apparently been taking place without the required UK export licences. In June 2010 in the EDO Decommissioners Case a jury acquitted seven activists of conspiracy to cause £180,000 criminal damage to the EDO MBM factory. Facing a ten-year prison sentence if convicted they admitted causing the damage, but pleaded not guilty to any crime on the grounds that their belief that EDO MBM had been supplying Israel with the ZRFAU at the time of Operation Cast Lead, and by extension that EDO MBM were complicit in war crimes carried out by Israel against the people of Gaza, was a reasonable belief. Paul Hills, the Director of EDO MBM, accepted during the trial that in light of all the documents admitted as evidence in the trial, then the activists belief was 'not unreasonable,' although as in previous sworn testimony he continued to deny it was true.

The three founding members, Ronan Gaughan, Ruairi Ferrie and former drummer Ruairi Cavanagh originally hail from Galway. Later members Arran Murphy is from Wicklow, and Darragh Shanahan, who was the band's drummer for four years, comes from Dublin. The band's music has been described as electro/synthpop with a slightly sombre overtone and introverted lyrical sensibility. According to Village they \\"seem to gather comparisons with the murkier side of electro pop, usually bands like New Order, Interpol or Joy Division. While the comparisons have some basis, DRN are far from gloomy, just a bit ... cool... But this cool does not translate into pretension, just humorous and knowledgeable asides to their favourite artists, photographers and filmmakers\\". The band's debut album We Love You Dark Matter was nominated for the Choice Music Prize.  Career  Dark Room Notes formed in Dublin in 2004, recruiting drummer Shanahan in 2006. They performed their first gig in Galway in December 2006. Their debut single Love Like Nicotine was released in late 2007 on Gonzo Records, and became an alternative radio hit. This was followed in summer 2007 by the Dead Start Program EP, which featured lead single Slow Puncture and an early recording of Shake Shake My Ceiling. The band were selected to play on the sixth series of the acclaimed RTÉ music show Other Voices. . Dark Room Notes topped the 'Viewer's Choice' poll on RTÉ for Series 6 of Other Voices.

Baselworld belongs to the MCH Group, which also organizes Art Basel in Basel, Miami Beach and Hong Kong. History The show dates back to 1917 with the opening of the first Schweizer Mustermesse Basel (muba), of which a section was devoted to watches and jewellery.1917-2017: A Brief Retrospective Of 100 Years Of Baselworld In 1925, muba invited several watch manufacturers to participate. In 1931, the Schweizer Uhrenmesse (Swiss Watch Show) was first held in a dedicated pavilion. After 1972's Europe's meeting place exhibition, companies from France, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom were also invited. In 1983, the show changed its name to BASEL with two numerals denoting the exhibition year, e.g., BASEL 83. In 1986, companies from outside Europe were included for the first time, reflecting the increased number of visitors from outside Europe. In 1995, the show was renamed to BASEL 95 - The World Watch, Clock and Jewellery Show In 1999, a new hall with 36,000 sq m of exhibition space was added. The year 2000 saw an increase of 6% in trade visitors. In 2003 the show was again renamed to Baselworld, The Watch and Jewellery Show. In 2004, with the introduction of a new hall complex, the exhibition area extended to 160,000 square meters, and attracted more than 89,000 visitors.

Quill, 521 U.S. 793 (1997), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court regarding the right to die. It ruled 9-0 that a New York ban on physician-assisted suicide was constitutional, and preventing doctors from assisting their patients, even those terminally ill and/or in great pain, was a legitimate state interest that was well within the authority of the state to regulate. In brief, this decision established that, as a matter of law, there was no constitutional guarantee of a \\"right to die.\\" Background The State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, making it a crime for a physician to administer lethal medication or to otherwise knowingly and intentionally end the life of a patient, even a consenting, mentally competent, and terminally ill patient. A number of physicians (here the respondents) filed suit against New York's Attorney General, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, challenging the law on constitutional grounds. The respondents argued that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, noting that a patient, while still enjoying the right to refuse treatment when terminally ill, did not enjoy the right to authorize a doctor to end their life. In effect, the respondents argued that refusing treatment and requesting that their doctor assist them in ending their life were \\"the same thing.\\" The District Court ruled in favor of the New York statute. In its decision, the court stated that the State of New York had a rational, legitimate interest in preserving life and protecting vulnerable persons; as such, the law was not unconstitutional. The District Court said that this was a matter of legislation, and, if the ban were to be repealed, it would take an act of New York's legislature (or a binding referendum by the voters) to do so. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's judgment. The Appeals Court reasoned that, even though the law itself applied as a general rule to all persons, a fact that the District Court noted in determining its constitutionality, it did not treat all competent patients equally when they were near death and wished to end their lives. To this effect, the Appeals Court said that, for example, a patient attached to a life support device was allowed to require its removal, while a person under identical circumstances could not demand that a doctor administer drugs to ensure the patient's death. It agreed with the contention that removing life support devices was identical to requesting physician-assisted euthanasia, and thereby reversed the lower court's finding. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari, hearing arguments on January 8, 1997. Supreme Court Decision On June 26, 1997, the Supreme Court issued six different opinions in a unanimous (9-0) decision. The majority opinion was authored by Chief Justice Rehnquist, and was joined by Justices O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas. Justice O'Connor wrote a concurring opinion, joined in part by Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer filed separate concurring opinions. The Court began its opinion by stating that the New York law did not infringe upon a fundamental right. In this line of reasoning, the Court referenced San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez ' which said, in relevant part, that the judiciary must look to the Constitution, rather than to the stated \\"importance\\" of a right, when determining whether that right was, indeed, fundamental. Because New York's ban did not infringe upon a fundamental right, and because respondents were not claiming that the \\"right to die\\" was fundamental, the Court reiterated its policy of according such laws a great deal of leeway. In the Court's own words, from Heller v. Doe, ' laws such as those enacted by New York were entitled to a \\"strong presumption of validity.\\" After addressing the matter of fundamental rights, the Court delineated the rationale behind its decision. It first turned to the long-standing legal tradition of looking to a person's intent as a way of distinguishing between two acts with identical physical consequences. For example, a person who accidentally kills a pedestrian while blinded by the sun might only face punishment for vehicular manslaughter, while a person who intentionally and purposefully kills another with his car could be punished for murder. While these two acts give the same results, they are distinguished by the intent of the actors. The Court applied the standard of intent to the matter at hand, finding that a doctor who withdraws life support at the request of his patient intends only to respect his patient's wishes. This, the Court said, is a sharp contrast to the doctor who honors a patient's request to end their life, which necessarily requires more than an intent to respect their wishes; namely, it requires the intent to kill the patient. A major difference, the Court determined, in the two scenarios is that the former may cause the patient to die from underlying causes, while the latter will cause the patient to die by the hands of the physician. To this effect the Court quoted a House Judiciary Committee hearing, stating that a physician performing an assisted suicide, \\"must, necessarily and indubitably, intend primarily that the patient be made dead.\\" Furthermore, in another repudiation of the respondents' argument, the Court noted that a patient removing life support might not actually intend to die, and that death without such a device may not be a certainty. Looking to New York's intent behind the ban, the Court noted that the law plainly recognized the difference between \\"killing\\" and \\"letting die.\\" It also recognized that the State of New York had, as a matter of policy, a compelling interest in forbidding assisted suicide, while allowing a patient to refuse life support was simply an act of protecting a common-law right. This right was not, contrary to the Court of Appeals' view, the \\"right to hasten death\\"; rather, the Court declared that it was the right to retain bodily integrity and to preserve individual autonomy. The prevention of \\"unwanted touching\\" was, the Court said, a very legitimate right to protect. In closing, the Court said that it fully rejected the respondents' argument that the statutory difference between assisted suicide and refusing lifesaving treatment was \\"arbitrary\\" and \\"irrational.\\" It did concede that there were probably incidents where the two were likely to have the same result, but also said that such an argument was beside the point. The Court declared that New York \\"obviously\\" had a number of legitimate, compelling, and rational interests in enacting this ban. However, regardless of these reasons, it determined simply that the law permitted everyone to refuse treatment and prohibited everyone from assisting suicide; as such, the law did not run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause and the state had the constitutional authority to put such a law into place. =O'Connor's Concurrence= Justice O'Connor joined the Court's decision. She accepted the contention that there was neither a \\"right to commit suicide\\" nor a \\"right to die,\\" as such. She did not, however, think that the Court needed to consider the conflict beyond rejecting the facial challenges to the statute. Justice O'Connor stated that, in the context of the questions presented in this case, the Court did not need to address whether a patient had a constitutionally cognizable interest in controlling the circumstances of his or her imminent death.\\" The statute, she claimed, was constitutional on its face, because the state had interests - such as protecting those who are not truly competent or facing imminent death or whose decisions would not be genuinely voluntary - of such gravity as to validate its legislation in pursuit of these interests. She said there was no constitutional conflict here; a patient was free to seek pain-relieving medication from their doctor, even at risk of health, to alleviate suffering, and this was a constitutionally acceptable alternative to permit in the absence of legalized assisted suicide. Justice O'Connor went on to say that, because everyone will face suffering of this kind (be it to themselves or a loved one), she had faith in the democratic process to strike an appropriate balance. In short, the law was up to the people of New York to decide. =Stevens' Concurrence= Justice Stevens joined the Court's decision. He stated, though, that he issued a separate opinion only to clarify his belief that there was the possibility of further debate on the constitutional limitations of a state's ability to punish assisted suicide. As the second-most senior Justice on the Court (after Chief Justice Rehnquist), it is likely that Stevens would have written the opinion himself had Rehnquist not elected to do so. This much is suggested by the length of Stevens' concurrence which runs several pages (official format) longer than Rehnquist's opinion. It is possible that the Chief Justice was in part persuaded to exercise this ability by the fact that Stevens' concurrence offers a less concrete view of the state's ability to regulate euthanasia than the majority of the Justices seem to support. Stevens notes that the Court construed the challenge to the statute as one of facial validity; i.e., that the respondents asserted that the law was invalid in all or most cases it might be applied. This type of challenge, he noted, is very difficult to argue successfully, because the challenger must show that the prohibited action is constitutionally protected. Applied to this case, the Court required that it be demonstrated that the Fourteenth Amendment included a right to commit suicide, and that such right included the right to receive assistance in doing so. Stevens agreed with the Court in rejecting this idea, believing that \\"liberty\\" as defined by the Due Process Clause didn't include such a right, because \\"The value to others of a person's life is far too precious to allow the individual to claim a constitutional entitlement to complete autonomy in making a decision to end that life.\\" In spite of this, however, Stevens said that the debate did not necessarily end there. He noted that the Supreme Court had found capital punishment to be constitutionally permissible, but had later also said that it could potentially be impermissibly cruel. As such, simply deciding that a certain statute outlawing assisted suicide was constitutional did not mean that every possible application would be likewise. He stated that he believed that a state had a compelling interest in preventing suicide prompted by depression or coercion; however, this interest does not apply when people are competent to make decisions and who are not being coerced or abused into decision. Stevens also rejected the argument, raised by the petitioners, that permitting physician-assisted suicide would taint the perception of the doctor/patient relationship. In some cases, he argued, a doctor's refusal to hasten death could be perceived as an act contrary to the doctor's role of healer. In cases such as these, he believed that the relationship would not be hindered by permitting the doctor to aid in the patient's demise. To conclude his opinion, Stevens stated once more that he agreed with the majority finding, and that the rationale in the decision was well founded. However, he drew a distinction between finding a law generally acceptable and finding it acceptable in all cases. While agreeing in principle, he noted that there could be some instances where the law unjustly infringed upon a patient's personal liberty. =Souter's Concurrence= Justice Souter issued a short clarifying concurrence, noting that he agreed with the ruling, but also stressing that he felt the claims raised were significant enough to warrant further justification. He cited his own concurrence in Washington v. Glucksberg ', reiterating that he felt the distinction between the permitted refusal of treatment and the prohibited assisted suicide was not an arbitrary one. =Breyer's Concurrence= Justice Breyer issued a joint concurrence with this case and Washington v. Glucksberg. He stated that he agreed that the distinction the law made between the practices in question was justified and rational. However, he thought that the majority erred both by stating that the respondents asserted a \\"right to commit suicide with another's assistance\\" and by stating that the right to choose one's manner of death was not fundamental. Justice Breyer felt it would be more appropriate to consider a \\"right to die with dignity.\\" Regardless of the semantics, Breyer's primary disagreement with the Court was his belief that it need not, and should not, have deemed whether such a right would be fundamental. He believed that there could be cases in the future with similar yet substantially different circumstances in which the Court may be forced to reconsider the terms used in this decision. =Ginsburg's Concurrence= Justice Ginsburg also issued a joint concurrence with this case and Washington v. Glucksberg. She stated that her reasoning largely mirrored that used by Justice O'Connor.

Life Bellers was born in London, the son of the Quaker Francis Bellers and Mary Read. Unable to attend University or join a profession as a result of his religion, John was educated as an apprentice cloth merchant. He rapidly became active in Meetings and in the Quaker community as a whole, purchasing of land in Pennsylvania in 1685 for Hugenot refugees for example. William Penn was a close friend. He married a fellow Quaker, Frances Fettiplace, in 1686, and they had six children between 1687 and 1695, although one died shortly after birth. From 1695 to his death in 1725, he was continually involved in writing innovative tracts on social issues, including education, health provision, care for the poor, support for refugees, a plan for a European State, and an argument for the abolition of capital punishment, making him \\"the first European advocate of the abolition of capital punishment\\". He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in February, 1719. On his death in London in 1725 he was buried in the Quaker Burying Ground, Bunhill Fields. His son Fettiplace Bellers (1687-1750) was a dramatist and philosophical writer. Proposals for Raising a College of Industry of All Useful Trades and Husbandry (1695) Bellers' essay is a proposal for a \\"College of Industry\\", a sort of colony for the poor - those who depend on their work or on charity for their living. Bellers argued that it was in the interest of the rich \\"to take care of the poor and their education\\". Bellers dedicated the first edition to his fellow Quakers, although the College was to be a \\"Civil Fellowship rather than a religious one.\\" The first edition of the pamphlet ends with an appeal for funding - An Epistle to Friends Concerning the education of Children - in favour of the College, signed by about forty- five leading Quakers. They included William Penn, Robert Barclay, Thomas Ellwood, John Hodgskin, Leonard Fell and Charles Marshall. The second edition (1696) was dedicated to Parliament. The Quaker Workhouse at Clerkenwell was established in 1702 as a result of his efforts. The combination of agriculture and manufacture would enable self-sufficiency and even profit. Bellers argued that if all \\"the present idle hands of the poor of this nation\\" were put to work, it would bring England \\"as much treasure as the mines do Spain\\".Industry brings plenty (Reprint, Headley bros., n.d) p. 22. The plans for the education of children at the College were ahead of their time. Practice and experience were to be valued over rote-learning. Bellers advocated the combination of learning and work as a way of preventing idleness. Karl Marx mentions Bellers in Chapter 25 of Das Kapital, quoting Bellers' argument that \\"the labour of the poor [is] the mines [sic] of the rich\\". Bellers is also quoted in a footnote in Chapter 23 of Das Kapital; \\"Labour [is] as proper for the body’s health as eating is for its living [...] Labour adds Oyl to the Lamp of Life when thinking Inflames it\\". Robert Owen read the proposals in 1817, and in a letter to The Times acknowledged their resemblance to the community he himself had created at New Lanark. He had 1,000 copies reprinted that year. Eduard Bernstein saw Bellers as a precursor of socialism, if not communism, highlighting his argument for valuing goods according to labour, not money. About the Improvement of Physick (1714) Bellers advocated a national system of hospitals, which were to treat the poor and act as training schools for new doctors. Eduard Bernstein saw in this essay an anticipation of a national health service.

Sometimes, it is a journey to a sacred place or to a shrine of importance to a person's beliefs and faith. Members of every major religion participate in pilgrimages. A person who makes such a journey is called a pilgrim. There are number of historical Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India. Places associated with the life of Buddha =Primary sites= Buddhism offers four major sites of pilgrimage: the Buddha's birthplace at Lumbini, the site where he attained Enlightenment Bodh Gaya, where he first preached at Benaras, and where he achieved Parinirvana at Kusinagara. These are three of the four holiest sites in Buddhism. The fourth, Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, is now in southern Nepal: * Bodh Gaya in Bihar, the site of the enlightenment of Gautama Buddha under a tree and top site in the list of world heritage sites in India. * Sarnath near Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, the site of the first sermon (Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta), where Buddha taught about the Middle Way, the Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path. * Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh, the site of the Buddha's parinirvana and home of many famous meditation & prayer offering sites in India.

He was a prominent and leading member of the Irish art group, the White Stag, along with Kenneth Hall. Biography Rákóczi was born on 31 May 1908 in Chelsea to Charlotte May Dobby and Ivan Rákóczi. His memories of his father rely mostly on fond reminiscences from his mother. Throughout his life he was proud of both his Irish heritage from his mother's side and his Hungarian heritage from his father's. He also held high regard for gypsy practices as his parents had been married in accordance to gypsy rites. Later in his life, he also rediscovered his Celtic roots. =Autobiography= Basil Rakoczi also wrote an autobiography that details his life in an imaginative but frank and honest way. There are currently no planned publications of this autobiography though an official biography is rumoured to being worked upon. Style His style varies greatly as he believed to explore psychological aspects of his work. A great many of his friends and contemporaries relied on psychology as a means of art and a number of his friends were members of the Society of Creative Psychology. As a result, his painting have a very modernist yet unique style that is only repeated within the group he formed and ran, The White Stag. He primarily used oil and gouache as a medium but frequently worked with monotype and watercolour and ceramics for tile designs. Exhibitions and Public Collections Basil Rákóczi's work has featured in over 150 exhibitions, of which more than 60 have been solo shows. His first commercial exhibition was in 1935 at the Artificer’s Guild in Cambridge and throughout his life, he had regular exhibitions at the Irish Museum of Living Art, the Royal Hibernian Academy and the Watercolour Society of Ireland. More recently, in the summer of 2005, his paintings were featured at the Irish Museum of Modern Art along with other White Stag works in a successful exhibition. Further exhibitions are in planning at locations currently unknown. He has art works in public collections across the globe including the University of Sussex, Derby City Art Gallery, Manchester City Art Gallery, Dublin's Trinity College, the Ulster Museum in Belfast, the Queensland Australia National Collection and Auckland City Art Gallery.

Its population is predominantly Maronite Catholic. Within the village center is Saint John's Church. Saint John is the patron Saint of Karmsaddeh. * Karm Saddeh On Google Maps Street View By Paul Saad Etymology Karmsaddeh is composed of two parts: Karm and Saddeh. * Karm is of Semitic origin and means Vineyard. * Saddeh could mean in Aramaic the Aromatic plants and also a measurement unit of 100 feet.Moubarac, Youakim (1984), Pentalogie antiochienne / domaine Maronite, volume 2, Tome II, Editions Cenacle Libanais, Beirut, page 666. History Karmsaddeh have been home for a very ancient settlement as one can still find ruins going most probably to the Greek and Roman (and maybe Phoenician) periods in the vicinity of the village, especially in the area of the extinct village of Qarheen (). According to some Historians, Qarheen was destroyed by the Mamluks at the end of the 13th Century and its inhabitants took refuge in Karmsaddeh. It is arguably known that Karmsaddeh has been inhabited for up to 2,000 years. The oldest reference to Qarheen is found on > a cooking-pot and its lid left to the Monastery of Qozhaya by Father George > (Jerjes), a priest serving the village of Qarhin, in the year 1000 of the > Christian era.The Official Website of the Monastery of Qozhaya - History, > Last viewed on May 17, 2007 At the beginning of the Ottoman era in Lebanon, Karmsaddeh was a relatively important village. In the first Ottoman Census of 1519, Karmsaddeh belonged to the Jebbet Bsharri region. All the inhabitants were Christians. The records show that there were 32 male adults (more than 15 years old), and 29 of them were married. If we adopt the common estimation of the Historians of that period, Karmsaddeh should have counted 211 inhabitants, which represented a relatively important settlement.Khalifeh, Issam (1995), Abhath Fi Tarikh Shamal Loubnan, Private Editor, Hadtoun, page 81. In the Census of 1571, Karmsaddeh counted 47 male adults, all Christians and married. It represents an annual demographic increase of 7.5 per mil per year, figure to be compared to the average of the region of 4.2 per mil per year. It is an important demographic vitality during the very difficult 16th century.Khalifeh, Issam (1995), Abhath Fi Tarikh Shamal Loubnan, Private Editor, Hadtoun, page 76. In 1885, the Maronite seminar of Mar Yaaqoub was founded in Karmsaddeh by the archbishop of Tripoli. It is still today one of the important seminars of the Maronite Church. At the end of the 19th Century, emigration to the new world started among the natives of Karmsaddeh. It continued all along the 20th Century and many people left to Africa (South Africa and Senegal), to France, Canada, the United States and Australia. The largest community of Karmsaddeh natives is found in the region of Sydney, Australia. It is estimated some 500 towns-people live in Australia. There is a 'Karm Sadde Charitable' Association based in Sydney. The Association is based in Chester Hill, in the City of Parramatta. The community is fairly active and holds several charitable events each year. Demographics The estimated population of Karmsaddeh is approximately 1,300 residents. It is estimated that there could be up to, or over 1,000 Karmsaddeh natives outside of Lebanon. The largest concentration is in Sydney, Australia. Karmsaddeh is a predominantly Maronite Catholic village. Saint Jacob's Church is one of the main village churches. There are currently two churches within the main village center, being dedicated to Saint John, the town's patron saint. One church is the older and smaller church, commonly used for weekday services, and the new church is used for Sundays and festivals as it has a larger capacity to hold the village population. Geography and Location Karmsaddeh is located along the main highway route connecting the main towns of Zgharta and Ehden. The village is located on a mountain side. While the built up parts of the village are relatively small, the overall area of Karmsaddeh is large and covers a fair expanse of land area. The village is approximately 22 km/13 mi south-east of Tripoli. The village is located approximately 750m above sea level which gives the village an all year round desirable climate, being midway between the coast and the mountains. In summer, the heat is mild, with mountain and sea breezes help reduce the coastal humidity experienced along the coast, whilst the village remains warmer than upper mountain villages in North Lebanon. In winter, the villages experiences some snow, however the village remains habitable. The village forms part of the end of the Quadisha Valley before the river feeds into the Mediterranean Sea. Facilities and amenity Karmsaddeh itself is a relatively well serviced village. Water supplies are available to all homes in the main village area. Electricity is provided to most households, however services are inconsistent as they are in most parts of Lebanon. Internet access is available to most of the village. Within the village are a number of small family-owned supermarkets that provide everyday items such as groceries. There are a number of cafe/eatery facilities located in the village. Generally, most other supplies must are available in Zgharta, which lies approximately 15 minutes from the village by road. Government services are also provided in Zgharta. Within the village is also; an Orthodox Monastery (Known as Hamatoura); Saint Jacob's Church and school and seminary; Saint John's Church; a village hall and burial ground. Karmsaddeh has a high residential population that has remained in the core of the village, unlike many other villages. This is due to a number of factors including the proximity of the village to major towns and cities, the year round habitable climate and the relative stability of the community. In recent years, many non-residents, notable residents and expatriates have invested in building homes in Karmsadde. Education There are two schools within the village, an Archdiocese School and a village school. Saint Jacob's School and Seminary are renowned throughout north Lebanon.

She depicted the fear of the bullfight and the danger faced by the torero precisely. Her attire was black and gold lke the jewelry of Toledo, Spain. She designed all of her own costumes. She performed at the American Music Hall in New York City in May 1910. In 1914 she appeared at the Colonial Theater owned by Benjamin Franklin Keith.

It was bought by the British Museum (with help from the National Art Fund), where it is on display in Room 35 from 22 March to 13 May 2007 before a 2-year tour to Hull (Wilberforce House), Liverpool, Bristol, Newcastle and London (Horniman Museum). The story of its acquisition was told in an episode of the documentary series The Museum. It was produced between 1997 and 2005 and is named after a place, the Bouche du Roi in Benin from which African slaves were transported to the Caribbean and Americas. In a wider context, it is primarily a warning against all kinds of human greed, exploitation and enslavement, both historical and contemporary. It is made from a combination of materials, including petrol cans (inflated to hold more), spices, and audio and visual elements (e.g. a recitation of Yoruba, Mahi and Wémé names from beneath the masks, the terrible sounds of a slave ship, and a video of black market petrol-runners in modern Bénin). The artwork’s arrangement recalls the famous 18th-century print of the slave ship, the Brookes. 304 ‘masks’ are made from these petrol cans, each with an open mouth, eyes and a nose, mirroring the Brookes images, yet gives back individuality and African cultures to the slaves by including tokens of African gods (Vodou or orisha) attached to each 'face'. Two masks at the stern of the ship - with the scales of justice between them - represent the white king imposed on Benin and the native king of Benin, dealing with African and European culpability for the trade. Liquor bottles, beads and cowrie shells are also included as examples of material which was used to barter for slaves, as are tobacco and spices, their smells mixed with those of a slave ship.

History JSG was founded in Manchester/Liverpool in 1974-1977 as a lobby group campaigning against the fascist National Front and for the left to relate more positively to Jewish issues. A London branch formed in 1977. They describe themselves as a political organisation campaigning for Jewish rights and the rights of all oppressed minorities in building a socialist future. The JSG supported the original Anti-Nazi League and was active in street-level militant anti- fascism. It participated in the Beyond the Fragments conference which sought to renew democratic socialism. In the early 1980s, it was active in campaigning for peace in Israel/Palestine. It developed a perspective via drawing on the tradition of the Bund, stressing Yiddishism, cultural pluralism and a commitment to the vitality of the diaspora. In the mid-1980s, it became associated with the Greater London Council's municipal socialism and multiculturalism, receiving funding to launch Jewish Cultural and Anti-Racist Project (JCARP). Additionally, it was frequently in conflict with the Jewish communal leadership and in particular, the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen (AJEX). The JSG has been critical of allegations of antisemitism in the Labour Party, stating in April 2016: > “Accusations of anti-Semitism are currently being weaponised to attack the > Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour party with claims that Labour has a ‘problem’ of > anti-Semitism...

The state was later renamed to Baden and became a founding state of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, today simply Germany) in 1949. In 1952, Baden became part of the modern German state of Baden-Württemberg.  Formation  At the Yalta Conference in 1945, France was allocated an occupation zone for the administration of post-war Germany. The south-west of Germany – previously consisting of Baden, Württemberg and the Prussian province of Hohenzollern – was divided between France in the south and the United States in the north. The border between the two zones was set so that the Autobahn connecting Karlsruhe and Munich (today the A8) was completely contained within the American zone; Bavaria was also placed under American administration. In the French zone, Hohenzollern and the southern half of Württemberg were merged to form Württemberg-Hohenzollern. The southern half of Baden was established as South Baden on 1 December 1945. Freiburg was designated as the capital of South Baden; the former capital of Baden (Karlsruhe) was in the American zone. A constitution for Baden was enacted on 19 May 1947, whose preamble laid claim to this new state being the true successor of the old Baden: although most of its territory had only been part of Baden for the previous 150 years. To reinforce this claim, the constitution also adopted the pre-World War II Baden flag and coat of arms for the new state. The constitution also made it clear that the name of the state was \\"Baden\\" instead of \\"South Baden\\". In 1949, the Baden parliament voted in favour of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany and became a founding state of (West) Germany upon its formation on 23 May 1949.  Politics  For the first year of its existence, South Baden was directly governed by the French military administration. After local elections in December 1946, the Badische Christlich-Soziale Volkspartei (BCSV) emerged as the strongest party and its leader, Leo Wohleb, was appointed by the French administration as president of the state secretariat. In April 1947, the BCSV became associated with the federal Christian Democratic Union (CDU), renaming itself to CDU Baden and was thus a predecessor of CDU Baden-Württemberg. On 24 July 1947 the first and only state elections were held in Baden, with Wohleb's CDU winning an absolute majority of 55.9%. The SPB - the Baden branch of the SPD - came second with 22.4%. Since the French military administration still held many key executive powers in Baden, a single-party government was not possible despite the CDU's absolute majority. Attempts to form an all-party government failed, owing to disagreements regarding the inclusion of the Communist party (KPD). Eventually, a grand coalition between the CDU and SPB was formed, with Wohleb as minister-president. After the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany and the end of French administration, single-party governments were again permitted and the coalition was no longer needed; from 1949 until 1952, Wohleb governed Baden at the head of a CDU-only government.  Disestablishment  The three states that merged to form Baden-Württemberg in 1952 With the end of military rule in West Germany, the three western powers requested that state leaders should re-examine and finalise the borders that had been established during occupation. In the south west, it was undecided whether Baden and Württemberg should be re-established as separate states (with Württemberg absorbing Hohenzollern, since Prussia had been abolished) or merged to form a new state. In Baden, Wohleb was a strong opponent of a merger. In 1950, a referendum regarding the merger of the three south-western states was carried out. Within the pre-1945 borders of Baden, the merger was rejected and a restoration of Baden was elected. This vote in Baden was outweighed by the more populous Württemberg, where the merger was accepted. Following this referendum, the three south-west states were merged to form the modern German state of Baden-Württemberg on 25 April 1952. Various legal contests were mounted against the referendum and the resulting merger. The newly founded Federal Constitutional Court of Germany (Bundesverfassungsgericht) rejected a nullification of the referendum in 1951, after the judges' vote ended in a draw. In 1956, the court concluded that the referendum in (South) Baden was not accepted by the majority and should be repeated. The Baden-Württemberg government did not allow this repeat to take place until fourteen years later in 1970: eighteen years after the merger. This time, the vote in (South) Baden was 81% in favour of the status quo.

Recent work with Sinan Aral has explored the question of which social network structures provide better access to novel information. In social networks, individuals might secure novel information by bridging two networks that are not otherwise linked. Information diversity provided by remote bridge ties, however, typically occurs at lower flow rates than among strong local ties. While information can be redundant in strong local ties, their flow rates can be so high that they provide more useful novelty. Aral and Van Alstyne termed the advantage of more diverse structure relative to the advantage of higher flow \\"the diversity-bandwidth tradeoff\\" and identified the factors causing access to favor one or the other.

It is an aminoglycoside that kills bacteria, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells by inhibiting protein synthesis.  History  Hygromycin B was originally developed in the 1950s for use with animals and is still added into swine and chicken feed as an anthelmintic or anti-worming agent (product name: Hygromix). Hygromycin B is produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus, a bacterium isolated in 1953 from a soil sample. Resistance genes were discovered in the early 1980s.  Mechanism of action  Hygromycin is active against both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. It acts by inhibiting polypeptide synthesis. It stabilizes the tRNA-ribosomal acceptor site, thereby inhibiting translation.  Use in research  In the laboratory it is used for the selection and maintenance of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that contain the hygromycin resistance gene. The resistance gene is a kinase that inactivates hygromycin B through phosphorylation. Since the discovery of hygromycin-resistance genes, hygromycin B has become a standard selection antibiotic in gene transfer experiments in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Based on impurity monitor method, four different kinds of impurities are discovered in commercial hygromycin B from different suppliers and toxicities of different impurities to the cell lines are described in the following external links. = Use in plant research = Hygromycin resistance gene is frequently used as a selectable marker in research on plants. In rice Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system, hygromycin is used at about 30–75 mg L−1, with an average of 50 mg L−1. The use of hygromycin at 50 mg L−1 demonstrated highly toxic to non-transformed calli. Thus, it can be efficiently used to select transformants.

Schulte's training for the priesthood was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. He was conscripted and served in the Prussian 4th Guard Grenadier Regiment. After 2½ years he was wounded. On his recovery he joined the Air Force to be trained as a pilot, and served in Palestine. Following the war he returned to his studies at the scholasticate in Hünfeld, and was ordained an Oblate Priest of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate in 1922. As a first obedience he was sent to South Africa as a missionary. In 1925 his childhood friend and fellow soldier Father Otto Fuhrmann died in South-West Africa of pneumonia complicated by malaria. It had taken him five days to reach the hospital of the Protestant Finnish mission where he died. This led Fr. Schulte to found MIVA, the \\"Missionalium Vehiculorum Associatio\\", known in German as the \\"Missions-Verkehrs-Arbeitsgemeinschaft\\", and the \\"Missionary International Vehicular Association\\" in English, to provide training and modern vehicles for missionaries, especially in Africa, Asia and Latin America, with the motto ' (\\"Toward Christ by land and sea and in the air\\"). Despite some opposition from his superiors he finally received the blessing of the Archbishop of Cologne. In 1929 Schulte made his first journey to the United States to raise funds. Finally the Pope himself gave his unqualified approval. In 1936 Father Schulte flew to the US on the airship Hindenburg and with papal permission celebrated the world's first aerial Mass in memory of his brother Lieutenant Franz Schulte who had died of influenza in 1919 while a POW in Raikeswood POW camp, Skipton, West Riding, Yorkshire, England. While over Keighley he dropped a parcel containing a bunch of carnations, a small silver and jet crucifix, some postage stamps, a picture postcard and some Hindenburg notepaper. It was found by two Scouts, who placed the carnations on Franz Schulte's grave. By that time MIVA had bought a dozen aircraft, and more than 150 automobiles and motorboats, used by mission stations in Albania, Latvia, Africa, Madagascar, Korea, New Guinea, Brazil and the Solomon Islands. Schulte was then assigned to a parish in Northern Canada. There, in August 1938, Schulte mounted a 2,200 mile medical evacuation on behalf of Father Julien Cochard from Arctic Bay, the most northerly Catholic mission in the world, to Chesterfield Inlet. In his Stinson Reliant floatplane Schulte flew through storm force winds and thick fog in order to rescue Cochard, and received a special blessing from Pope Pius XI for his services. Schulte was transferred to St. Henry's Seminary in Belleville, Illinois during World War II where he helped found the National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows. He continued his work with MIVA until his death in Swakopmund, Namibia, in 1975. He is buried beside his boyhood friend, Father Otto Fuhrmann. In 2007 MIVA celebrated its 80th anniversary. It has branches all over Europe, the United States and Korea, and still raises money to provide everything from aircraft to horses.

He is the current manager of Raheny United in the Women's National League (Ireland). Playing career Eviston made his League of Ireland debut for Home Farm at Tolka Park on 2 November 1975. On 7 August 1976 Home Farm played Everton in a pre season friendly at Goodison Park. Twenty years later the same club provided the opposition in Eviston's testimonial. In 1978, he joined Bohemians and was their top scorer in the league in 1980/81 with 9 goals from 20 games (1 as substitute).Bohemian FC match programme, Vol. 52, no. 19 In total he played 110 league games (99 plus 11 as sub) scoring 31 league goals. He made a scoring debut for Bohs on 10 September 1978. He made 6 appearances in European competition for Bohs against AC Omonia and Dynamo Dresden in the 1978–79 European Cup and Sporting Clube de Portugal in the 1979–80 UEFA Cup. On 30 April 1980 he represented the League of Ireland against Argentina at the River Plate Stadium where Diego Maradona scored in a 1–0 defeat and on 3 September 1981 Terry was part of a League of Ireland side that played Brazil in Maceió. During that season he was the club captain at Dalymount. His last game for Bohs was the 1983 FAI Cup Final loss. After five seasons at Dalymount Park Rovers new manager Jim McLaughlin (footballer) signed Terry in July 1983. In his first season at Milltown, Rovers won the League for the first time in twenty years. After 2 goals in 25 total appearances Terry transferred to Athlone Town A.F.C. in November 1984. He made his debut at Sligo on the 18th and until he signed for Dundalk in the summer of 1986 he played in all 43 league games in that period. In his seven years at Oriel Park he won the League twice, the FAI Cup once and the League of Ireland Cup twice and won the Soccer Writers' Personality of the Year award in 1987–88. He was also Player of the Month in March 1988. He also made 6 appearances in European competition for Dundalk against AFC Ajax in the 1987–88 European Cup Winners' Cup, against Red Star Belgrade in the 1988–89 European Cup and Budapest Honvéd FC in the 1991–92 European Cup. In the 1990-91 League of Ireland season Eviston was everpresent in the league scoring 10 goals as Dundalk won the league on the last day at Cork with Eviston playing a role in Tom McNulty's winner. He rejoined Rovers in the summer of 1993 and scored 6 goals in 25 appearances as he picked up his fourth League medal in his first season back in the Hoops. He made one appearance for Rovers in the 1994-95 UEFA Cup. His last game for Rovers was the final game of the 1995-96 League of Ireland season. In May 1996 a League of Ireland XI played Everton in Eviston's testimonial at Dalymount Park. He won an Irish amateur cap against Greece in 1978 and an Olympic cap against Hungary in 1986. His 101st and last League of Ireland goal was the winner for Cobh against Galway United on 20 September 1997. Cobh goalkeeper Nicky Byrne saved a penalty to ensure the home side their first win of that season.

Operating without air cover, the Allied effort failed, with the whole of the Dodecanese falling to the Germans within two months, and the Allies suffering heavy losses in men and ships.Cunningham Pg 582 The Dodecanese campaign, lasting from 8 September to 22 November 1943, resulted in one of the last major German victories in the war.Irving, David (1990). Hitler's war. Viking press, p.584 Background The Dodecanese island group lies in the south-eastern Aegean Sea, and had been under Italian control since the Italo-Turkish War in 1911. During Italian rule, the strategically well-placed islands became a focus of Italian colonial ambitions in the Eastern Mediterranean. Rhodes, the largest of the islands, was a major military and aerial base. The island of Leros, with its excellent deep-water port of Lakki (Portolago), was transformed into a heavily fortified aeronautical base, \\"the Corregidor of the Mediterranean\\", as Benito Mussolini, the Italian leader, boasted. An early British attempt to contest Italian control of the Dodecanese, codenamed Operation Abstention, was thwarted in February 1941, when Italian forces recaptured the island of Kastellorizo from British commandos. After the Battle of Greece in April 1941 and the Allied defeat in the Battle of Crete in May 1941, Greece and its many islands were occupied by the Axis powers. With the defeat of Axis forces in the North African campaign in May 1943, Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, who at least as far back as the Gallipoli campaign in World War I had a deep interest in the region, turned his sights on the islands. The British envisaged an operation to capture the Dodecanese and Crete, to deprive the Axis of excellent forward bases in the Mediterranean and to apply pressure on neutral Turkey to join the war. This would promote a favorite idea of Churchill's, that of a \\"route through the Dardanelles to Russia as an alternative to the Arctic convoys.\\"Antony Beevor, Crete, The Battle and the Resistance In the Casablanca Conference, the go-ahead was given and Churchill ordered his commanders to have plans ready for 27 January 1943.Anthony Rogers (2007), p. 49. Operation Accolade called for a direct attack on Rhodes and Karpathos, with three infantry divisions, an armored brigade, and support units. Landings at Crete, which was too well fortified and had a strong German garrison, were dropped. The main problem faced by the planners was the difficulty of countering Fliegerkorps X of the Luftwaffe because of a lack of air cover, as American and British aircraft were based in Cyprus and the Middle East. This challenge was exacerbated by the demands of the upcoming Allied invasion of Sicily. The Americans were skeptical about the operation, which they regarded as aiming mostly at post-war political benefits for Britain and an unnecessary diversion from the Italian campaign. They refused to support it, warning the British that they would have to go it alone.Anthony Rogers (2007), pp. 51–52. As an Italian surrender became increasingly possible, in August 1943 the British started preparations to take advantage of a possible Italian-German split, in the form of a smaller version of Accolade. A force based on the 8th Indian Infantry Division was assembled, and American assistance in the form of P-38 Lightning long-range fighter squadrons was requested. As a result of the Quebec Conference and the US refusal to assent to British plans, the forces and ships earmarked for Accolade were diverted barely a week before the surrender of Italy in the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September.Anthony Rogers (2007), pp. 54–56. Prelude =Fall of Rhodes= The Dodecanese Islands On the announcement of the armistice (surrender), the Italian garrisons on most of the Dodecanese Islands either wanted to change sides and fight with the Allies or go home. Anticipating Italian surrender, German forces, based largely in mainland Greece, had been rushed to many of the islands to maintain control. The German forces were part of Army Group E commanded by Luftwaffe General Alexander Löhr. The most important German force in the Dodecanese was the 7,500-strong Sturm-Division Rhodos (Assault Division Rhodes, Generalleutnant Ulrich Kleemann commanding). This division was formed during the summer on the island of Rhodes, which was the administrative center of the Dodecanese Islands and possessed three military airfields. Because of this, Rhodes was the principal military objective for both the Allies and the Germans. On 8 September 1943, the Italian garrison on the island of Kastelorizo surrendered to a British detachment, which was reinforced during the following days by ships of the Allied navies. The next day, a British delegation, headed by Lord Jellicoe, was dropped by parachute on Rhodes, to persuade the Italian commander, Admiral Inigo Campioni, to join the Allies. Swift action by the German forces forestalled the Allies. Without waiting for the Italians to decide, Kleemann attacked the 40,000-strong Italian garrison on 9 September and forced it to surrender by 11 September. The loss of Rhodes dealt a critical blow to Allied hopes. The government of the Kingdom of Italy surrendered and many Italian soldiers in the Aegean were tired of the war and had become opposed to Mussolini. Italian Fascist loyalists remained allied to Germany in the Greek campaign. German forces in Greece convinced 10,000 Italians in the Aegean to continue to support their war effort. Despite this setback, the British High Command pressed ahead with the occupation of the other islands, especially the three larger ones of Kos, Samos, and Leros. The Germans were known to be overstretched in the Aegean, while the Allies enjoyed superiority at sea and the air cover provided by 7 Squadron, SAAF and 74 Squadron, RAF (Supermarine Spitfires) at Kos was deemed sufficient. It was hoped that from these islands, with Italian cooperation, an assault against Rhodes could be eventually launched.Anthony Rogers (2007), pp. 66–67. From 10 to 17 September, the 234th Infantry Brigade (Major-General F. G. R. Brittorous) coming from Malta, together with 160 men from the Special Boat Service, 130 men from the Long Range Desert Group, A Company of the 11th Battalion, Parachute Regiment and Greek Sacred Band detachments had secured the islands of Kos, Kalymnos, Samos, Leros, Symi, Castellorizo and Astypalaia, supported by ships of the Royal Navy and Royal Hellenic Navy. The Germans quickly mobilized in response. By 19 September, Karpathos, Kasos and the Italian-occupied islands of the Sporades and the Cyclades were in German hands. On 23 September, the 22nd Infantry Division (Lieutenant-General Friedrich-Wilhelm Müller) garrisoning Fortress Crete was ordered to take Kos and Leros.Anthony Rogers (2007), p. 87. Battle =Battle of Kos= Having identified the vital role of the Allies' only airfield at Kos, Fliegerkorps X bombed it and the Allied positions of the island, from 18 September. Reinforcement aircraft arrived, giving the Germans 362 operational aircraft in the Aegean by 1 October.Anthony Rogers (2007), pp. 78–84. The British forces on Kos numbered about 1,500 men, 680 of whom were from the 1st Durham Light Infantry, the rest being mainly RAF personnel and Italians of the 10th Regiment, 50th Infantry Division Regina. On 3 October, the Germans effected amphibious and airborne landings known as Unternehmen Eisbär (Operation Polar Bear) and reached the outskirts of the capital later that day. The British withdrew under cover of night and surrendered the next day. The fall of Kos was a major blow to the Allies, since it deprived them of vital air cover. The Germans captured 1388 British and 3145 Italian prisoners. On 4 October, German troops committed a war crime by executing the captured Italian commander of the island, Colonel Felice Leggio and nearly 100 of his officers. =Battle of Leros= After the fall of Kos, the Italian garrison of Kalymnos surrendered, providing the Germans with a valuable base for operations against Leros. Unternehmen Leopard (Operation Leopard) was originally scheduled for 9 October but on 7 October, the Royal Navy intercepted and destroyed the German convoy headed for Kos. Several hundred men and most of the few German heavy landing craft were lost; replacements were transported by rail, and it was not until 5 November that the Germans had assembled a fleet of 24 light infantry landing craft. To avoid interception by the Allied navies, they were dispersed among several Aegean islands and camouflaged. Despite Allied efforts to locate and sink the invasion fleet, as well as repeated shelling of the ports of German- held islands, the Germans suffered few losses and were able to assemble their invasion force, under Generalleutnant Müller, for Unternehmen Taifun (Operation Typhoon) on 12 November. The German invasion force consisted of personnel from all branches of the Wehrmacht, including veterans from the 22nd Infantry Division, a Fallschirmjäger (paratroop) battalion and an amphibious operations company Küstenjäger (Coast Raiders) from the Brandenburger special operation units. The Allied garrison of Leros consisted of most of the 234th Infantry Brigade with men of the 2nd The Royal Irish Fusiliers (Lieutenant Colonel Maurice French), the 4th The Buffs (The Royal East Kent Regiment), 1st The King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) and the 2nd Company, 2nd Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment (Brigadier Robert Tilney), who assumed command on 5 November. There were also regular Italian soldiers, mostly naval personnel, under Admiral Luigi Mascherpa. Leros had been subjected by the Luftwaffe to a prolonged aerial bombardment, starting on 26 September, which had already caused significant casualties and damage to the defenders of the island and supporting naval forces. In the early hours of 12 November, the invasion force in two groups approached the island from east and west. Despite failures in some areas, the Germans established a bridgehead, while airborne forces landed on Mt. Rachi, in the middle of the island. After repulsing Allied counter- attacks and being reinforced the following night, the Germans quickly cut the island in two and the Allies surrendered on 16 November. The Germans suffered 520 casualties and captured 3,200 British and 5,350 Italian soldiers. =Naval operations= Since the operational theater was dominated by a multitude of islands and the Allies and Germans had to rely on naval vessels for reinforcements and supplies, the naval component of the campaign was especially pronounced. Initially, naval presence on both sides was low, most of the Allied shipping and warships had been transferred to the central Mediterranean in support of the operations in Italy, while the Germans did not have a large naval force in the Aegean. The Germans had air superiority, which caused the Allies many losses in ships. Vice Admiral Werner Lange, German Naval Commander-in-Chief of the Aegean, tried to reinforce the isolated German garrisons and carry out operations against Allied garrisons, while transporting Italian prisoners of war to the mainland. Allied ships tried to intercept these ships, resulting in heavy losses. On 23 September, damaged the torpedo boat TA10 and sank the steamer , which had 1,576 Italian captives on board. Another disaster occurred a month later, when USAAF B-25 Mitchells and RAF Beaufighters sank the cargo ship , which had 2,389 Italian POWs, 71 Greek POWs and 204 German guards on board, of whom only 539 were saved. On 14 September, the first Allied loss occurred, when the Greek submarine RHN Katsonis, was rammed and sunk by U-boat hunter UJ 2101. The Luftwaffe also intervened on 26 September, when 25 Junkers Ju 88s sank RHN Vasilissa Olga and at Lakki Bay, Leros, followed on 1 October by the Italian destroyer and on 9 October sank and seriously damaged the cruiser . At the same time, the short range of Hunt-class destroyers , RHN Pindos and RHN Themistoklis prevented them from intercepting the German invasion convoy headed for Kos. Further losses on both sides followed; after the loss of Kos and friendly air cover, the Allied navies concentrated on supply missions to the threatened islands of Leros and Samos, mostly under the cover of night. From 22–24 October, and Eclipse sank in a German minefield east of Kalymnos, while RHN Adrias lost its prow. Adrias escaped to the Turkish coast and after makeshift repairs, sailed to Alexandria. On the night of 10–11 November, destroyers , and ORP Krakowiak bombarded Kalymnos and bombarded Kos, where German forces were assembling for the attack on Leros. The German convoy reached Leros on 12 November, escorted by over 25 ships, mostly submarine chasers, torpedo boats and minesweepers. During the subsequent nights, Allied destroyers failed to find and destroy the German vessels, limiting themselves to bombarding the German positions on Leros. With the fall of Leros on 16 November, the Allied ships were withdrawn, evacuating the remaining British garrisons. By that time, the Germans had also used Dornier Do 217s of Kampfgeschwader 100 (KG 100), with their novel Henschel Hs 293 radio-controlled missile, scoring two hits. One caused severe damage to HMS Rockwood on 11 November and another sank two days later. The Allies lost six destroyers sunk and two cruisers and two destroyers damaged between 7 September and 28 November 1943. Aftermath After the fall of Leros, Samos and the other smaller islands were evacuated. The Germans bombed Samos with Ju 87 (Stukas) of I Gruppe, Stukageschwader 3 in Megara, prompting the 2,500-strong Italian garrison to surrender on 22 November. Along with the occupation of the smaller islands of Patmos, Fournoi and Ikaria on 18 November, the Germans completed their conquest of the Dodecanese, which they held until the end of the war. Only the island of Castellorizo off the Turkish coast was held by the British, and was never threatened. The Dodecanese campaign was one of the last great defeats of the British Army in World War II, and one of the last German victories, while others have labelled it a hapless fiasco which was badly conceived, planned and executed as a \\"shoestring strategy\\". The German victory was predominantly due to their possession of air superiority, which caused great losses to the Allies, especially in ships, and enabled the Germans to supply their forces. The operation was criticized by many at the time as another useless Gallipoli-like disaster and laid the blame at Churchill's door; perhaps unfairly so, since he had pushed for these efforts to be made far sooner, before the Germans were prepared. The British failure to capture the Dodecanese sealed the fate of Jews living there. Although Italy had passed the anti-Jewish law of the Manifesto of Race in 1938, Jews living on the Dodecanese islands (and Italian- occupied Greece) experienced much less antisemitism than in the German and Bulgarian occupied zones of Greece, where harsher and harsher policies were implemented, culminating in March 1943 with deportations to the death camps in occupied Poland. The Italian surrender, the German takeover and the failure of the Allied offensive meant that the haven disappeared. Most of the Dodecanese Jews were murdered by the Germans; 1,700 members of the ancient Jewish community of Rhodes (of a population of about 2,000) were rounded up by the Gestapo in July 1944 and only some 160 of them survived the camps. Out of 6,000 Ladino-speaking Jews in the Dodecanese, about 1,200 people survived by escaping to the nearby coast of Turkey. Italian prisoners of war were transferred to the mainland by the Germans in overcrowded unseaworthy vessels, which led to several accidents, of which the sinking of the on 12 February 1944 was the most deadly. More than 4,000 Italians died when the ship sank in a storm; other ships were sunk by British forces. The revival of German fortunes in the eastern Mediterranean helped restore Francisco Franco's confidence in the German war effort, shaken by the Allied landings in North Africa and Italy, and ensured several months of continued Spanish tungsten exports for German war industry.

He was shot 22 times by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies, who fired 81 rounds. In 2006, Brunston's family settled with the county for $340,000 after filing a lawsuit, accusing the sheriff's deputies of causing wrongful death.  Incident  At the time he was being sought for questioning from an alleged domestic abuse incident after his girlfriend called 9-1-1. After initially evading the police, Brunston was cornered in a nearby doorway where he and the officers tried to negotiate. He repeatedly told the officers he was wanted for murder (which was false), would rather die right there than go back to prison, and that he was armed and would shoot a police dog and the deputies if the dog was released or they fired first. The incident can be viewed along with camera person's descriptions and Deandre's actual communications with deputies that also appear in captions in a documentary \\"Catching Hell in the City of Angels\\". The video is quite graphic. The incident is shown as it played out in real time. The deputies are not seen but they can be heard as they were less than truthful with Deandre.Lawsuit questions tactics in L.A. sheriff's shooting Greg Risling, Associated Press in North County Times and SF Chronicle. January 16, 2006. However he had no gun but had a flip-flop sandal in his right hand hidden under his T-shirt. Brunston repeatedly stated that he would throw the \\"gun\\" down and surrender if he were allowed to speak to his girlfriend, Fonda Brown, who he said was pregnant with his child, but his request was never granted. At this point, many officers had their guns drawn and trained on Brunston. Lt. Patrick Maxwell had been contacted via cell phone while he was at a party in a drunken state. He ordered the dog to be released to attack Brunston. The senior K9 officer on the scene, Sgt. Earnest Burwell, refused to release the dog, claiming that releasing under those circumstances would violate the existing use-of-force policy. Burwell was replaced with a rookie K9 unit who made no such claims. The dog was released and Brunston immediately tossed the sandal onto the ground. Before the dog reached Brunston, deputies opened fire. The dog was hit by police bullets and fell a split second before it reached Brunston, who had taken one step in retreat from the dog. Within the next five seconds, deputies had discharged 81 shots, seriously wounding both Brunston and the dog, who both later died of their injuries.Parolee, Police Dog Killed; The first sheriff's canine to die in the line of duty is accidentally shot as deputies confront man. Jose Cardenas, Los Angeles Times, Aug 26, 2003. Adding to the controversy of this shooting is the disparity in medical treatment—the wounded police dog received an emergency helicopter airlift from the scene to a veterinary center in Norwalk (where it died later) -- while Brunston was left bleeding to death on the concrete steps, leading to allegations of Brunston receiving sub-par treatment as compared to the dog.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-aug-26-me- shoot26-story.html No gun was found on or near Brunston.

Early life Princess Clémentine was born in 1872 at the Royal Castle of Laeken (northwest Brussels); she was the third daughter, and last child, of King Leopold II of Belgium and Marie Henriette of Austria. She had two older sisters, Princess Louise, and Princess Stéphanie. Her brother, Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant, had died of pneumonia in 1869, after having fallen into a pond. Leopold neglected Clementine and her older sisters, and had a strained relationship with his wife and children. Clémentine was raised by her mother, who had, reportedly, a difficult temper. Her sisters married when she herself was quite young. Princess Louise had married in 1875 and Stephanie in 1881. However, once Clémentine came of age, she was given independence by her father to travel without her mother's approval. She later wrote, thanking her father, saying, \\"Thanks to you, dear father, I have been able to find happiness.\\" However, the happy opportunity to travel ended when Clémentine's mother died in 1902, and Clémentine was obliged to assume the functions of the first lady at the Court of Brussels. Love interests Throughout Clémentine's life she had three known romantic interests. The first was her cousin Prince Baudouin, eldest son of her uncle Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders, and heir to her own father after the death of her brother Leopold. Baudouin did not return Clémentine's affections and died in his early 20s. The second was Baron Auguste Goffinet, a member of the Belgian court. However the baron did not have 'royal' blood. The last love, which she never relinquished, was Prince Napoléon Victor Bonaparte, who had become heir to the Napoleonic empire after the death of his cousin Napoléon Eugène, Prince Imperial, son of the former Empress Eugénie. Prince Victor Napoleon Princess Clémentine first met the Bonaparte prince in 1888 when he visited the palace; she later confided in one of her sisters that she was attracted to him. King Leopold opposed this match, because they are descendants of the house of Bourbon-Orleans, who claim the French throne. The princess, who is a great-granddaughter of the last French King Louis-Philippe would become a part of the dispute between the House of Orleans and the House of Bonaparte. The choice of the princess resulted in arguments between father and daughter. In 1903, when she was 31 years old, Clémentine again asked her father for permission to marry the prince, and he again refused. Clementine persisted but was threatened by the king with disinheritance. Father's death and Clementine's marriage Leopold died in 1909, enabling Clémentine to request permission to marry from the new monarch, King Albert I, her cousin and Prince Baudouin's younger brother. The wedding of Princess Clementine and Prince Napoleon Victor Bonaparte took place in Castle of Moncalieri, Kingdom of Italy, on 10 November/14 November 1910. She later wrote to her sister Stephanie, now married to the Hungarian Count Elemer Lonyay, saying, \\"My good husband, gentle, adoring, tender, loving, intelligent, connoisseur of people and things. He is beautiful, this Prince. Napoleon is a love, I adore him.\\" Napoleon and Clémentine had two children: Princess Marie-Clotilde, born in 1912, and Louis Jérôme Bonaparte, born in 1914. Through this marriage all the current members of the imperial family of France descend from king Louis Philippe of France. Death She died in Nice in 1955. She had been predeceased by her husband in 1926. She was the last surviving legitimate child of Leopold II.

Walt Risler of Indiana University assisted in the early development of the method, and Robert Martin, founding commander of the Los Angeles Police Department Threat Management Unit played a role in later development and enhancements. (Martin now heads up the MOSAIC threat assessment Unit at Gavin de Becker & Associates.) The first MOSAIC systems were developed before 1992. The computer-assisted MOSAIC method is now used by the Supreme Court Police to assess threats to the Justices, by the U.S. Capitol Police for threats against Members of Congress, by police agencies protecting the governors of eleven states, by many large corporations, and by more than twenty top universities. There are different MOSAIC systems for different situations, including: * Threats and fear in the workplace * Threats by students * Threats against judges and other judicial officials * Threats against public figures and public officials * Domestic abuse situations The MOSAIC method poses a series of questions to users, accompanied by a range of possible answers. For every area of inquiry, the system provides a button for “Premise of the Question” – providing immediate on-screen research citations about why that particular area of inquiry is part of the assessment process. MOSAIC calculates the value of the answers selected by the assessor, and expresses the results on a scale of 1 to 10. Unlike most assessment tools, many of which are paper checklists, MOSAIC automatically produces a full written report, describing the factors that were considered and the selections made by the user. MOSAIC's on-line resources include a library of research, publications, and training videos that users can access during an assessment. Types of MOSAIC =MOSAIC – public figures (MAPP)= MOSAIC for assessing unwanted pursuit of public figures (MAPP) is used by agencies protecting elected and appointed officials, national security agencies, and iconic public figures. Lieutenant Tom Taylor, four-time president of the National Governor's Security Association, wrote for the Institute of Police Technology and Management: > The consistent way in which MOSAIC methodically guides an evaluation and > documents the findings is what sets it apart. In fact, since it places less > emphasis on the presence (or lack) of a direct threat, as well as any > denials of intent that are uttered in an interview, MOSAIC forces the > investigator to look at all of the factors present in the situation.Taylor, > Tom. (2000). Dodging Bullets: A Strategic Guide to World-Class Protection. > Institute of Police Technology and Management. =MOSAIC – judicial officials (MAJ)= In the mid-nineties, Ted Calhoun of the United States Marshals Service undertook a research project about threats and attacks on federal judges. He studied and analyzed more than 3,000 cases of threats against Federal judges and prosecutors. Calhoun felt that these threats – often made by people whose lives were directly affected by the court – were inherently different from threats to other public figures, with whom the threateners rarely had any real contact. The marshals service selected the MOSAIC method for applying Calhoun's research, and Gavin de Becker & Associates was commissioned to co-develop a new system: MOSAIC for Assessment of Threats to Judges (MAJ). The book Hunters and Howlers: Threats & Violence Against Federal Judicial Officials describes the method that evolved into this MOSAIC: > By drawing as complete a mosaic of the threatener and each of his > inappropriate communications as possible, de Becker’s system identifies > those situations requiring a defensive reaction or a proactive response. The > problem is thus managed to the best and least intrusive protection of the > victim. The whole approach is informed by an intelligent, comprehensive > process of thinking. De Becker’s assessments are the best because he asks > the most comprehensive questions, and he consistently asks them of every > communication. To do less risks more.Calhoun, Frederick S. (February 1998). > Hunters and Howlers: Threats and Violence Against Federal Judicial Officials > in the United States. United States Marshals Service. A variation of MAJ is now used by Sheriff's Deputies, bailiffs, and others tasked to protect judges and other judicial officials. =MOSAIC – domestic violence (DV-MOSAIC)= DV - MOSAIC assesses situations involving domestic violence. As of April 2010, DV - MOSAIC is available at no-cost to the public at www.mosaicmethod.com. A study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and published by the National Criminal Justice Reference Service found that when compared to two specific instruments, the Domestic Violence Screening Instrument (DSVI) and the Kingston Screening Instrument for Domestic Violence (K-SID), DV - MOSAIC “performed best in predicting subsequent stalking or threats.” The study also reported that MOSAIC tested highest on “sensitivity,” correctly classifying most of the women that were re-assaulted; had the strongest correlation between the victims’ perception of risk of re-assault and risk of serious harm; captured relevant information equally well with victims of various ethnicities; had scores that were significantly associated with abuse; and provided uniformity of assessment (called Inter-rater Reliability) such that ten different people of different abilities and styles would come up with the same preliminary rating.Roehl, Janice Ph.D.; O’Sullivan, Chris Ph.D.; Webster, Daniel ScD; and Campbell Jacquelyn, Ph.D. (May 2005).

It will help law enforcement deal with situations successfully.\\" =MOSAIC – workplace violence (MAT-W)= MOSAIC – workplace violence assesses the three most likely sources of violence in the workplace: angry employees, angry former employees, and stalkers who pursue their targets at the workplace. The development of this MOSAIC was guided by an Advisory Board of experts and practitioners from industry, government, and law enforcement. This version of MOSAIC is used by professionals in security departments, legal departments, and human resources offices of large organizations, government agencies, and universities. =MOSAIC for assessment of threats by students (MAST)= The development of MOSAIC for threats by students (MAST) included an exploration into the pre-incident indicators of explosive school violence. The process drew on more than two hundred experts and practitioners from the fields of education, counseling, psychology, parenting, threat assessment, law enforcement, the judiciary, and students. The MAST is used by school administrators, counselors, and security/law enforcement officers. In 1997, Chief James Perrotti of the Yale University police stated that the department used MOSAIC for assessing threats made to Yale professors. He stated that MOSAIC allowed police to prioritize cases and better allocate their resources.Sachsman, Susanne (September 8, 1997). Prof Stalkers Beware: MOSAIC is here. [Yale News]. In 2007, the Missouri Campus Task Force report to the Governor of Missouri on campus security and violence prevention included the recommendation that “Each institution should thoroughly evaluate the viability and appropriateness of using assessment tools (e.g. MOSAIC) designed to identify individuals with the potential for violent behavior.Missouri Campus Task Force. (August 21, 2007). Security Our Future: Making Colleges and Universities Safe Places to Learn and Grow. Missouri Department of Higher Education.\\" The Superintendent of the L.A. County Office of Education said about MOSAIC: “This is not something where I call you in and give you the third degree. I give myself the third degree because parents want to know why. It just can't be, ‘I don't like your child, I don't like what he does, and I can't explain why.’ This is bringing us to a higher level.Dr. Don Ingwerson, Superintendent of the L.A. County Office of Education .\\" The Oprah Winfrey Show In April 2010, Oprah Winfrey dedicated an hour-long show to applying the MOSAIC method to domestic violence situations. It was announced on the show that Gavin de Becker was making MOSAIC available to anyone at no cost. Tens of thousands of audience members accessed MOSAIC within the first two weeks, and this MOSAIC remains available to anyone today at no cost at www.oprah.com or www.mosaicmethod.com.The Oprah Winfrey Show (April 16, 2010). Gavin de Becker. Controversy about MOSAIC In an article on the method, psychologist Hill Walker, a professor at the University of Oregon who had studied behavioral disorders in schoolchildren for 34 years told Wired Magazine, \\"There are some serious validity issues here, some reputation-ruining implications.Forrest, Brett (June 2000). UltraViolencePredictor 1.0. Wired\\" The developers note that Hill Walker has never seen or used a MOSAIC system, and was commenting on the idea or concept, not the actual method. In a letter to the editor following publication of the article, de Becker wrote that MOSAIC for Assessment of Student Threats (MAST) “is the opposite of profiling in that it is always applied to an actual known individual, and it always explores actual behavior and circumstance.de Becker, Gavin (September 2000). Rants & Raves. Wired In an editorial, Professor Laurence Steinberg (who had never seen MOSAIC) questioned the value of the method for predicting violence: > In a nation of 90,000 schools, trying to pick out the dozen or so students a > year who might commit murder is like looking for a needle in a haystack the > size of Kansas .Steinberg, Laurence. (April 22, 2000). Software Can't Make > School Safe. New York Times. De Becker responded that MOSAIC for Assessment of Student Threats (MAST) is never applied to the general population of students, and rather just to those students who self-identify by making a threat. The NY Times published a letter by de Becker, commenting on Professor Steinberg's editorial. Additional Information and Comments Regarding MOSAIC * In 2007, the London Times reported that the city of Croydon had adopted the DV-MOSAIC model in conjunction with the co-located services approach developed by the Family Justice Center in San Diego.The London Times (2007) . * In 2001, an article in Sheriff Magazine by Dr. Frederick Calhoun stated: “Although originally designed for assessing threats to Federal judicial officials, MOSAIC's assessments are relevant to all aspects of the judicial setting.Sheriff Magazine (2001) .\\" * In 2000, officials from the CIA, Yale University Police Department, the U.S. Capitol Police, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the U.S. Marshals Service, the California Highway Patrol, and other experts participated in a comprehensive review of the MOSAIC used for assessment of threats to public figures, and an updated system emerged, now known as the MOSAIC for Assessment of Public-figure Pursuit (MAPP). * In 2000, the State of California convened a group of experts to study the domestic violence MOSAIC, and suggested changes and enhancements. This led to the development of a special MOSAIC called CAL-MOSAIC which the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) provided at no cost to each of the State's 600+ police departments.Commission on Peace Officers Standards and Training * In 1999, the Los Angeles and Chicago school districts participated in a project to develop a MOSAIC specially designed for assessing threats made by students. Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Schools, said at a press conference, \\"Our schools need to avoid overreacting to threats that aren't substantial, and this system can help them in this respect. We can't be afraid of new technology, we can't be afraid of new approaches. Violence is a fact of life across this country, and we need to equip our principals with the analytical tools to make accurate calls as to which services and intervention support to make available to their students.Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Schools .\\" * In 1998, MOSAIC was selected by the National Victim Center as one of the “Top Ten Most Promising Strategies and Practices in Using Technology to Benefit Victims.” * U.S. Attorney General Meese and FBI Director Webster presented a special award to Gavin de Becker for “Outstanding work in developing a threat assessment model that has been of great assistance to law enforcement and criminal justice agencies.U.S Attorney General Meese & FBI Director Webster .\\" * Los Angeles County Law enforcement agencies adopted MOSAIC in 1997 to help police manage and reduce spousal abuse cases that might escalate to homicide.

Passage of the Act The bill was introduced into the Scottish Parliament in 1999 by Mike Watson MSP with support from SNP MSP Tricia Marwick. In September 2001, the Scottish Parliament rejected a negative committee report about the Bill from its Rural Development Committee and voted to support the general principles of the Bill. On 13 February 2002 the Parliament voted by eighty three to thirty six to pass the legislation to ban hunting with dogs. MSPs decided not to give compensation to those whose livelihoods or businesses might suffer as a result of the ban. The Scottish Countryside Alliance attempted to block introduction of the legislation by taking their case to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, although their appeal was not successful and in July the Judge recognised the will of the Parliament on this issue. The Act came into effect on 1 August 2002. Impact of the ban An article in The Guardian on 9 September 2004 reports that of the ten Scottish hunts, nine survived the ban, using the permitted exemption allowing them to use packs of hounds to flush foxes to guns (an exemption which is strongly opposed by people against hunting). A number of convictions have taken place under the Act, two for people hunting foxes and ten for hare coursing. The only prosecution of a traditional fox hunt led to a not guilty verdict, but to a clarification of the law, with the sheriff saying that the activity of flushing foxes to guns \\"will require to be accompanied by realistic and one would expect, effective arrangements for the shooting of pest species. The use of what might be termed \\"token guns\\" or what was described by the Crown as paying lip service to the legislation is not available ... as a justification for the continuation of what was referred to in the evidence before me as traditional fox hunting.\\" There is controversy over the impact on the number of foxes killed by hunts. Hunts say that the number killed by hunts has doubled because shooting is more effective than chasing with dogs. Since the ban, two new fox hunts have started in Scotland, the Strathappin and the Dumfriesshire and Stewartry. 2016 review In December 2015, the Scottish Government announced that a review would be held that would look at legislation dealing with hunting with dogs, with the review to be led by Lord Bonomy. In November 2016 a report was published with various recommendations, including making amendments to the law.

The group also supported federal funding for all kinds of stem cell research, including embryonic stem cell research.Republican Majority for Choice - 2008 Legislative Priorities (link changed to '-2010 Legislative Priorities', may not correctly reference material cited.) RMC had a political action committee and supported Republicans across the country who favored abortion rights. The group closed operations in 2018. The name was chosen to emphasize information based on polling that consistently shows that a majority of Republicans support legal access to abortion in at least some circumstances. In 2009, Gallup reported that 66% of Republicans agreed that abortion should be legal in some (54%) or all (12%) circumstances. A Gallup poll in 2011 found that 27% of Republicans identified themselves as \\"pro-choice\\". However, 42% of Republicans support legal abortion during the first trimester. In 2017, Gallup released polling information showing that 36% of Republicans identified as \\"pro-choice\\" and 70% agreed that abortion should be legal in some (56%) or all (14%) circumstances. In 2018, a NBC/Wall St Journal poll found that 52% of Republicans supported the Roe v Wade Supreme Court ruling and did not want said ruling to be overturned. History The Republican Majority for Choice began its life as the Republican Coalition for Choice, founded in 1989 by Mary Dent Crisp, former Co-Chair of the Republican National Committee and former National Committeewoman from Arizona. It was renamed from the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition in 2004 after an American Viewpoint Poll commissioned by Republicans for Choice found that 69% of Republicans strongly agreed with the following statement: \\"The decision to have an abortion should be between a woman, her doctor and her family. Government should not be involved in making such a personal decision.\\"John Avlon on Anti-Abortion vs. Pro-Choice, Radical middle. The Republican Majority for Choice was allied with other Moderate to Liberal Republican Groups such as The Republican Main Street Partnership, Christine Todd Whitman's It's My Party Too, Ann Stone's Republicans for Choice, the Log Cabin Republicans, The Wish List, Republicans for Environmental Protection, and the Kansas Traditional Republican Majority. In 2018, the RMC announced that it was closing operations and its leadership announced they were leaving the GOP citing the party's anti-abortion platform. Supported candidates The following candidates were supported by the Republican Majority for Choice in one or more of their elections. Their status has been updated to reflect their current positions as of the 2010 U.S. elections. As of July 2018, three Republican Senators had identified themselves as \\"pro-choice,\\" or pro-abortion rights, Shelley Moore Capito, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski. \\"Collins, Murkowski, and Capito have voted for both pro- and anti-abortion legislation, but all three back the 1973 Roe v.

Setting  The Ramlar referred to in the title is not the name of the world, but its creator, an omnipotent deity who rules over the many other gods and goddesses who rule various aspects of the world. The world itself is divided into two continents, default gameplay beginning on the continent of Eranon.  System  Ramlar uses a combat system called \\"The A/B System\\" (short for Armor/Body). Character sheets prominently display a body diagram. The body diagram is essentially a hit location chart with each body part having its own life points and armor to protect that part. Ramlar also makes use of a combat mechanic called momentum, which allows players to turn previous success into an opportunity for potentially larger successes. The game uses percentile dice.

She spread the gospel alongside her husband, Daniel Marshall (1706-84), who is generally regarded as the first great Baptist leader in the state of Georgia. Her husband was once jailed in Virginia for refusing to stop preaching the gospel. Although she was three months pregnant at the time, she exhorted those around that it was wrong to forbid a man to preach the Biblical truth of baptism. Her words convicted a young man named Cartledge and he became a preacher; she also converted the arresting constable and magistrate. She often stood alongside her brother Shubal Stearns and spoke at Baptist meetings. Martha also assisted her husband Daniel in his churches. She gave birth to six sons and two daughters. Contributions In 1810, Virginia Baptist historian Robert Semple wrote of Marshall’s contributions to Baptist work: > 'Mr. Marshall had a rare felicity of finding in this lady, a Priscilla, a > helper in the gospel. In fact, it should not be concealed that his > extraordinary success in the ministry, is ascribable in no small degree, to > Mrs. Marshall’s unwearied, and zealous co-operation. Without the shadow of a > usurped authority over the other sex, Mrs. Marshall, being a lady of good > sense, singular piety, and surprising elocution, has, in countless instances > melted a whole concourse into tears by her prayers and exhortations!' Baptist historian George Paschal, in his History of North Carolina Baptists, wrote of Daniel and Martha: > “As a result of the labors of this earnest and fervent evangelist, in which > he doubtless had the assistance of his saintly and gifted wife, Mrs. Martha > Stearns Marshall, great numbers turned to the Lord.” Biography In the late 1750s, the Marshalls founded a Separate Baptist church at Abbott’s Creek in North Carolina. There Martha served alongside her husband and “was noted for her zeal and eloquence,” and she “added greatly to the interest of meetings conducted by her husband.” The first difficulty the new church encountered was that no minister would cooperate with Stearns in ordaining Daniel. A pastor in South Carolina refused to participate in an ordination service because Daniel and the Separate Baptists “allowed women to pray in public and illiterate men to preach, and encouraged noise and confusion in their meetings.” The ordination service finally took place when Elder Ledbetter, Daniel’s brother-in-law, agreed to participate in the ordination. In 1771, the Marshalls moved to Columbia County, Georgia, where they founded the first Baptist church in Georgia, located at Kiokee. A. H. Newman wrote of their efforts in founding this work: > “Marshall was now sixty-four years old and had behind him a truly apostolic > record. Almost equally useful was his wife, a sister of Shubal Stearns.” Legacy In 2007, Baptist Women in Ministry instituted the Martha Stearns Marshall Day of Preaching to invite churches to encourage women to preach. On a Sunday in February each year, \\"we will join together to celebrate hearing the voices of women as they preach in pulpits across the United States. As more women enter the ministry, churches have a greater opportunity to welcome them into their pulpits,\\" said Pam Durso, Associate Executive Director of the Baptist History and Heritage Society.  Abbotts Creek Church Rules of Decorum In 1832, the Abbotts Creek Church divided. The members who aligned with the missionary/Sunday school movement of the Southern Baptist Convention met in conference in June 1834 to reorganize. Below are items 5 and 7 of the Rules of Decorum that they drafted at this meeting: > 5\\\\. It shall be the duty of each member to attend all church meetings by the > hour of 11 O'clock and any member not prevented by known bodily infirmity > failing to attend two meetings in succession shall be cited to come forward > and show cause why he has done so. And if any female member not prevented by > infirmity or disease repeatedly neglect to attend at church meeting, there > shall be some person or persons to inquire the cause. Abbotts Creek Church Minutes June 1834 (original document available in Z. Smith Reynolds Library of Wake Forest University) > 7\\\\. Every male member upon going to speak shall rise from his seat and > address the Moderator and members generally.Abbotts Creek Church Minutes > June 1834 (original document available in Z. Smith Reynolds Library of Wake > Forest University) It is evident from these two items that these Baptists > did not encourage women to speak during their conference meetings, much less > to preach during public worship. If Martha Marshall had been an ordained > preacher in this church just 75 years earlier, these good Baptists evidently > did not know it. These rules were not drafted by the \\"Old School\\" or > Primitive Baptist side, but by the more progressive Missionary side. Martha > Marshall was, without a doubt, a godly, faithful woman, a great influence on > the members of Abbotts Creek and other churches, and was an indispensable > help to her husband, Elder Daniel Marshall. She honored her Lord, Jesus > Christ, by her unselfish labors and by her love for God's people. She may > have, on occasion, given an account of the work of God on her soul.

The city of Kara-Köl, south of the reservoir (downstream from its dam) housed the dam construction workers, and currently is home to the hydro power plant staff. The city of Toktogul is located north of the reservoir. Environmental and Social Impact The reservoir was created in 1976 after construction works on the dam were completed and the Kementub Valley was flooded. The reservoir flooded more than 26 thousand hectares of land, of which 21.2 thousand hectares of agricultural land, 26 communities including large settlement Toktogul were displaced and the main road through the region was re-routed. Archaeologists excavated barrows from Saka times before the sites were lost. 2009 crisis Toktogul Reservoir reached a critical state with regard to the water level behind the dam in 2009. A cold dry winter, combined with sales to foreign countries as well as increased domestic demand left the reservoir at a fraction of its capacity. Electrical rationing had to be employed throughout the entire country with outages lasting up to 11 hours every day.

It was completed by 1819, to provide better access to the town, but was not a commercial success, and was abandoned in the 1880s after the arrival of the railways. History In 1578, John Leslie the Bishop of Ross produced a map of Scotland, which was published in Rome. Dingwall was of sufficient importance to be included on the map, and when James VI awarded it a burgh charter in 1587, it mentioned cobles and small boats. However, there was a problem caused by the deposition of alluvium from the rivers Conon and Orrin, which made access more difficult, and by 1773 the burgh was in a depressed state. There is some indication that improvements were made to the river soon afterwards, on a plan dated 1777, but a major scheme was actioned in 1815. The River Peffery was made deeper and wider, to allow boats to reach the town. The project was designed by the canal engineer Thomas Telford and involved diverting the river through a temporary cut so that a new course for it could be constructed. The work was completed by 1819, at a total cost of £4,365, to which the burgh had contributed £100 in 1815. The canal was not a commercial success, as it only generated an income of £100 per year. In 1828, Telford estimated that repairs were needed which would cost £800, and so the town council asked the Commissioners of Highland Roads and Bridges to take over responsibility for it. Their action was not successful, and the burgh continued to manage it. By 1838, it was deemed to be a tolerably good harbour, and there was incoming trade in coal, lime and other goods, with grain, timber and bark passing in the other direction. Ships could dock safely away from the mud flats in what was effectively a tidal basin. Decline The canal was in length, and its life was fairly short. The Inverness and Ross-shire Railway arrived in Dingwall in 1863, becoming part of the Highland Railway two years later, after which most of the traffic was lost,Dingwall Historic Trail and the canal ceased to be used by the 1880s. The railway crossed the canal by a bridge which is a listed structure. Immediately to the north of the canal, the railway forks, with one line running northwards to Wick and Thurso, and the other running westwards to the Kyle of Lochalsh. The harbour at the mouth of the canal and a footbridge near the harbour are also listed structures. Legacy Warning signs at the side of the canal The route of the canal still forms a pleasant walk from the town to a picnic site on the Cromarty Firth, although there is a firing range nearby, which fires over the canal, and so there are red warning flags and signs to indicate when it is unsafe to use this route. Dingwall has a Common Good Fund, which was set up to benefit the people of the town. The deeds for the old part of Jubilee Park, which is located on the south bank of the canal, indicate that the canal is one of the assets of that fund, although no deeds have been found to prove that this is actually the case.

Drinkwater came from an old Liverpool family and was born on 28 March 1812. His grandfather was James Drinkwater, Mayor of Liverpool in 1810 who married a Miss Elinor Leece, of Ballamona, Braddan. The long European peace, which followed the Battle of Waterloo, resulted in many English children being sent to France for education, among them William Leece Drinkwater, who attended Angoulëme College and became fluent in French. He then attended the Royal Institution School in Liverpool and then St John's College, Cambridge. He graduated with a BA degree in 1834 and later took an MA degree. He was called to the English Bar (Inner Temple) in 1837 and subsequently practised in the Northern circuit acting as a reporting barrister in the Common Pleas Division. Ten years later Drinkwater was appointed Second Deemster of the Isle of Man, and eight years later First Deemster. As a judge his record was one of which any man would have had good reason to be proud. His profound knowledge of both English and Manx law, his common sense and his impeccable impartiality made him almost the perfect judge. His position as Deemster entitled him to a seat in the Legislative Council and his record as a member of the Legislature was as distinguished as that of his career as a judge. In politics he was a conservative. He was also very independent and this independence often brought him into conflict with Sir Henry Loch, who was very autocratic in his methods and ruled Legislative Council with a rod of iron. Drinkwater was the only member of the Council willing to put up a fight and seldom came off second best. Despite their frequent bickerings in the Council and Tynwald Court, Loch and Drinkwater were friends in private life. In 1877 on the recommendation of Lieutenant Governor Sir Henry Loch he was knighted. In the autumn of 1897 he resigned his Deemstership and retired from public life. After retiring from the bench and Legislature, Drinkwater continued to take a great interest in the Isle of Man Hospital being Chairman of the Committee. He had married his first cousin, Elenor Drinkwater Bourne (1818-1897), in 1841. He died on 22 May 1909 and his funeral was a private affair with only seven family members present: at the time of his death he had one surviving child, George Leece Drinkwater (1852-1930). Sir William Leece Drinkwater was a descendant of the ancient family of Drinkwater, of Bent, in Chesire. According to Burke's Landed Gentry, the Drinkwater's Crest is 'Three wheat ears, two in saltire, one in pale or, encircled by a ducal coronet ppr.'

Directed by Robert Schwentke, the film stars Eric Bana, Rachel McAdams, and Ron Livingston. The story follows Henry DeTamble (Bana), a Chicago librarian with a paranormal genetic disorder that causes him to randomly time travel as he tries to build a romantic relationship with Clare Abshire (McAdams), who would become his wife. Filming began in September 2007, originally in anticipation of an autumn 2008 release. The film's release was postponed with initially no official explanation from the studio. McAdams later noted that the delay was due to additional scenes and reshoots that could not be completed until the season at their outdoor location matched previously filmed footage, and Bana had regrown his hair following his work on the 2009 film Star Trek. Produced by New Line Cinema, the film was released on August 14, 2009, by Warner Bros. Pictures. Plot In the early 1970s, Henry DeTamble is in a car accident that kills his mother but which he survives by inadvertently time traveling back two weeks. Moments later, Henry is helped by an older version of himself who has also traveled back. Unable to control the timing or destinations of his traveling, Henry finds himself drawn to significant people, places, and events in his life but is incapable of changing events beyond the minor differences his presence creates. In 1991, Henry meets Clare Abshire in the library where he works. She is overjoyed to see him although he is actually meeting her for the first time. Clare explains that she met Henry's future self when she was a child, and that he informed her then that they would meet in the future, which is happening at the moment. Since childhood, Henry has been Clare's best friend and has visited her. As a child, Clare develops a crush on Henry, and she is upset to learn that he is married. When Clare turns 18, two years before their meeting at the library, the older Henry kisses her, leading her to realize that he is her husband in the future. They begin a relationship, which is challenged by Henry's disorder. His sporadic time traveling is further complicated by the fact that he arrives at his destinations completely naked. From an early age, he had learned how to pick locks and to steal clothing to endure his travels. Among his getaways are many visits to young Clare. From present-day Clare's diary, he gets a list of dates when he visited her, and gives those to young Clare so that she can be waiting for him with clothes. Falling in love, Henry and Clare eventually marry, though he actually time travels away before the ceremony and a visibly older version of himself arrives in time to step in, slightly confusing the guests. Henry's disappearances take a toll on his relationship with Clare. To make up for this, Henry buys a winning lottery ticket by having the numbers in advance, but their relationship still has problems. Henry and Clare witness a middle-aged wounded Henry briefly arrive from another time, leaving them concerned about how long Henry has to live. His disorder also makes having a child with Clare seemingly impossible, as Henry's genes cause their unborn fetuses to time travel. They seek a renowned doctor's help, but after numerous similar miscarriages, Henry has a secret vasectomy to end their suffering. However, soon after, Clare gets pregnant one last time—by a visiting younger version of Henry—and carries the baby to full term. Before the child is born, Henry travels forward in time and happily meets their pre-teen daughter, Alba. She tells him that she is a time traveler, too, but has increasing control over when and where she travels. Alba tells Henry that he will die when she is five years old, a fact that Henry subsequently hides from Clare. Alba's pre- teen self, who ultimately tries to prepare her younger self for Henry's death, visits young Alba sporadically. Clare is devastated to discover Henry's impending death. Later, Henry time travels and is accidentally shot by Clare's father, who is hunting elk. Henry returns in time to die in Clare's arms. Some years later, a younger Henry visits Alba and Clare, giving Clare hope that he will visit again, though he tells her not to spend her life waiting for him, hoping this encounter would provide a proper closure for both Clare and Alba. Cast In addition, Alex Ferris plays six-year-old Henry, while Fiona Reid, Philip Craig, Maggie Castle and Brian Bisson play Clare's parents and siblings, respectively. The wedding band is played by Broken Social Scene. Production The film rights for Audrey Niffenegger's 2003 novel The Time Traveler's Wife were optioned by Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt's production company Plan B Entertainment, in association with New Line Cinema, before the work was even published.Dave McNary, \\"Rubin rewriting 'Time'\\", Variety (January 2, 2007). Retrieved May 4, 2009. Niffenegger stated in an interview that as she was writing the book, she had thoughts of how a film version of the book would appear. When asked about the prospect of her novel being turned into a film, Niffenegger said, \\"I've got my little movie that runs in my head. And I'm kind of afraid that will be changed or wiped out by what somebody else might do with it. And it is sort of thrilling and creepy, because now the characters have an existence apart from me.\\"James Cowan, \\"Niffenegger's first book, and it's about time\\", National Post (December 3, 2003).

Directors Steven Spielberg and David Fincher briefly expressed interest in the project, though no negotiations took place. In March 2005, director Gus Van Sant entered negotiations with the studio to helm the project. The negotiations did not hold, and in November 2006, director Robert Schwentke was instead hired to take over the project. In January 2007, New Line hired screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin to rewrite Leven's script. Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams were cast in April 2007. Filming began in Toronto on September 10, 2007. It was also shot in Hamilton, Ontario. The film was originally planned for a fall 2008 release, but it was postponed with no official explanation from the studio. When asked about the delay, McAdams said, \\"We wound up doing a reshoot, and Eric was the holdup … He had to shave his head for a different role, for Star Trek, I think … We did an additional scene in the meadow, so we were also waiting on the meadow to look the way it did [the first time we shot].

Music The score to The Time Traveler's Wife was composed by Mychael Danna, who recorded his score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Ocean Way Studios during the fall of 2008. The movie repeatedly features the musical theme of an old German hymn, \\"Es ist ein Ros entsprungen\\", whose familiar harmonization was written by German composer Michael Praetorius. This is heard just prior to the early car accident, is played at holiday gatherings, and is otherwise interwoven into the score. The trailer featured the song \\"Broken\\", by Lifehouse, which is in the film and the promotional music video. A television commercial for the film featured the song \\"Show Me What I'm Looking For\\", by Carolina Liar, although it was not included within the soundtrack. The film also features a cover of Joy Division's \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\", performed by Canadian indie rock band Broken Social Scene. The official motion picture soundtrack was released as a download on August 11, 2009 by New Line Records. A CD version was released by Decca Records, but is generally only available from vendors outside the United States. =Soundtrack= =Additional songs= There were three songs appearing in the film, but not included with the release of the soundtrack. * \\"Show Me What I'm Looking For\\" – Performed by Carolina Liar – 4:00 * \\"Clocks\\" – Performed by Coldplay – 5:07 * \\"Gone to Earth\\" – Performed by The American Analog Set – 3:13 Reception =Critical response= The film has received mixed reviews from critics for the same reasons as the novel, praising the characterization of the couple, applauding their emotional depth; others criticized the melodramatic style and the plot as emotionally trite. Based on 158 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, The Time Traveler's Wife has a 39% approval rating from critics, with an average score of 5.11/10 saying, \\"Though it may satisfy fans of the novel, The Time Traveler's Wifes plot's contrivances and illogical narrative hamper its big screen effectiveness\\". Metacritic, another review aggregator which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film an average score of 47 based on 31 reviews. =Box office= The film opened third behind District 9 and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, grossing $19.2 million on its opening weekend. Grossing $101,229,792 worldwide (over $63,000,000 of which was grossed in the United States) on a $39,000,000 budget, the film was a financial success.

She still teaches and directs at the Workshop and serves as the Artistic Director Emeritus. Biography Piven was born Joyce Goldstein. In 1954, she met Byrne Piven at the University of Chicago. They wed a short time later. They had their first child, Shira Piven, in 1961, and later had their second child, Jeremy Piven, in 1965. After the death of her husband, Byrne Piven, in 2002, she continued to reside and teach in Evanston, and eventually moved to Los Angeles in 2017 to be with her children and grandchildren. Career In the 1950s, the Pivens were two of the founding members of the Playwrights Theatre Club, along with Paul Sills and David Shepard. Playwrights featured such budding stars as Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Ed Asner and Barbara Harris. They later formed the Compass Players, a forerunner to The Second City. In 1970, Joyce and Byrne Piven founded the Piven Theater Workshop. Based in Evanston Illinois, the Workshop was founded with the goal of teaching acting through theater and improvisation games. The technique was relatively new at the time, with Joyce and Byrne having been mentored by Theater Game Theorist Viola Spolin, and continuing the practice in their individual work as well as through the workshop. Joyce continued to direct and teach within the workshop until 2017, when she moved to Los Angeles to be with her children and grandchildren.

In addition, craftsmen and builders were usually responsible to the muhtasib for the standards of their craft.Hill, Donald.

This has led him into various areas of the philosophy of language and logic, and he has written about rules and rule-following, vagueness, synonymy, and assertion, and about the works of Wittgenstein, Quine, Davidson and Dummett.

Originally meant to star in a 2004 hardcover called JLA: Kid Amazo,Brady, Matt. \\"Kid Amazo Postponed,\\" Newsarama (Mar. 16, 2004). Accessed Oct. 25, 2008. he made his debut three years later, in the pages of JLA Classified; as a result, he was \\"predated\\" by the similar Marvel Comics character Victor Mancha, the son of Ultron. His civilian identity is Frank Halloran. Fictional character biography Kid Amazo, like his \\"father\\" before him, was built by mad scientist Professor Ivo, who was still pursuing his dream of vengeance against the Justice League of America. As Amazo was merely an advanced robot that failed, the next approach would be to cross bio- mechanical material from Amazo's body with human ova and DNA, in order to obtain a cyborg being who would exhibit the best traits of both human and artificial life. To advance his plans and complete Kid Amazo's instruction and programming, Professor Ivo sends him away to live with humanity. The young cyborg is given the human identity of Frank Halloran, a 21-year-old college student, student of existentialism and follower of Nietzsche's Übermensch concept. Frank forms a close relationship with Sara Shapiro, who, unbeknownst to him, is his \\"mother\\" (or at least the donor of the human ova needed for his creation). Sara is the daughter of Professor Ivo, who assigned her to be the young cyborg's handler. As Frank is ignorant of his true past, he merely sees Sara as a confidant and believes he cannot pursue a relationship with her because her Jewish parents would disapprove of Frank's atheism. Upon witnessing a battle between Amazo and the Leaguers, young Frank Halloran is forced to reconsider his assumptions when Amazo saves Sara's life. He becomes increasingly fascinated by superheroes and their ideals, where Sara responds only with cold detachment. Frank, still shaken up, is later confronted by Amazo itself. Amazo reveals to Frank the truth about his nature, and Frank convinces himself to join Amazo, whereupon he assumes the alias \\"Kid Amazo\\". Eventually, Kid Amazo has a change of heart and decides to fight on the side of the angels, leaving Professor Ivo to wonder which will be stronger — Frank's human upbringing or his mechanical origins. Frank's every attempt to be a hero backfires horribly, and when Amazo unleashes a Big One earthquake in Berkeley, the \\"Kid\\" is forced to stop him. However, his attempts to help are misunderstood and when the authorities pursue him, he is forced to wound a policeman to escape. Alone, Frank tries to hone his newfound abilities. The Martian Manhunter performs a psychological evaluation on Frank and judges the boy to be on the brink of insanity. The Justice League decides to closely monitor Frank's further attempts to better himself by exploring both sides of his heritage. He fights minor villainy as \\"The Kid\\", but winds up the target of Amazo, the League, and Sara herself. This, added to his inability to cope with his isolation and loneliness, leads him to explore his villainous side, which again brings him to the attention of the Justice League. His life in shambles and his sanity shattered by the revelations about his past, Kid Amazo embraces his full power. Able to mimic both powers and minds, he truly becomes a one-man Justice League. However, his power becomes his downfall, as Batman and the rest of the Leaguers decide to voluntarily bicker and quarrel among themselves, destabilizing both their team and Kid Amazo's mind. The stress of a single mind mimicking a shattered team is enough to make Kid Amazo explode. In the end, Sara is left to mourn her son/lover, and the League is left to deal with the real rancor unearthed by their phony quarrel. =Rebirth= A new Kid-Amazo appeared in the DC Rebirth series, Super-Sons, created by Peter J. Tomasi and Jorge Jimenez. Reggie Meyer was a relative of a family both cured and empowered by \\"The Amazo Virus\\". They went about their day to day lives protecting their small hometown in Providence, Rhode Island as its own superhero team. Reggie however was more inclined to being a bully than he ever was a good Samaritan, and his particular household was prone to infighting even before they all got a hold of superpowers. His rotten character only grew worse when an inert program of the original android's technology in Lex Luthor's laboratory's beckoned to him, and showed him the location of the Amazo Armor which would greatly enhance his powers.Super Sons #2 After procuring the armor he then kidnapped and imprisoned his family in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. He kept them sequestered there while making bio-android replicas of them that served him. Acting out on his personal familial hate fantasy he would kill them over and over for weeks on end. His younger sister, being a technopath, however, managed to assert her will over Reggie's Sara duplicate and flee the staging facility. When the Super Sons chanced upon his android sibling Kid Amazo sent mechanized doppelgangers, first of Superman and Batman, and then robotic Superboy/Robin replicas against them in order to retrieve his sister. Having captured the duo, the original Kid Amazo presented himself to them. He then went into a diatribe about how he planned to strike down the Justice League and create replicas of them to feed his army of Amazo Exoskeletons. But first he would contemplate eliminating his so-called family instead of simply murdering their replacements beforehand. At the last second Lex Luthor, having picked up the distress signal Damian pinged to him before detainment, arrived, and a fight broke out as he and Superboy escaped with Reggie's comatose family. While distracted by Superlex his other two adversaries would return to face him down in a final confrontation, in an attempt to re-absorb all the skills and powers of his Replicants to add to his power. However, Robin had Sara painfully remove the sentient Amazo armor from him, ending the threat he posed for a time. Super Sons #4 Somehow Reggie got hold of the Amazo Armor again and attended a Black Bacchanal, a shindig and black market weapons sale for super- villains. It was headed by the crime boss and arms trader Tiger Shark, as well as being attended by a host of dangerous criminal syndicates, superpowered crooks and ne'er-do-well's as well as most every form or tier of malcontent from every major city world wide. He admitted he only attended so he could create more clones to stockpile on superpowers and special skills from all the bad guys who attended, only to be blasted away by Nightwing using Magog's lance. Nightwing #23-24 Powers and abilities Due to his Amazo \\"heritage\\", Kid Amazo has the abilities of the first League core members, but has only displayed super strength, speed, invulnerability, flight, heat and x-ray vision, and an accelerated healing factor. His main and most advanced power is being able to mimic the mind and personality of the core members of the Justice League, gaining an intimate knowledge of the relationship between the Leaguers and being able to predict the outcome of their teamwork. He possesses the absorption cells of his predecessor. Rebirth Kid Amazo has the following: Bio-fission: Reggie can duplicate himself into a finite number of replica's who all share a hive mind, enabling them to compile and ascertain any information through received experience. Collective Strength: Both he and his clones gain multiplied strength dependent on their dupe numbers. Collective Intelligence: Kid Amazo would cleave his own mind, imparting some of it onto his carbon copy's. This retroactively augmented their group IQ giving them a shared genius mind. After stealing parts of technology from the original android and splicing them together, Reggie managed to repurpose it constructing the Amazo Armor. The suit directly interfaces with the virus in his blood greatly amplifying his infection given abilities. Nemesis Cloning: While adorning the armor, Reggie can create biomechanical android duplicates of anyone whom he sets his power on. All of their skills, abilities, persona and special powers can be emulated through this unique process. Duplicate Siphon: Kid Amazo can reabsorb his mimesis body doubles in order to acquire their powers or skills. Depending on the number of clones he's made for his army, he can multiply the effective strength of any natural skills they possess.

Nearby, an area 114 m above sea level is the lowest elevation of Austria. Characteristic of the area are wide open plains and salt marsh flora, with many small salt lakes around.Lange Lacke - Neuseidlersee.com The Lange Lacke (Long Lake) is the largest of about forty such lakes nearby. History The community was first mentioned in records in 1318. In 1867, the Austrian Empire was dissolved, and Austria-Hungary was formed, with separate governments in Vienna and Budapest. Since 1898, due to the Pro-Magyar politics in Budapest, the Hungarian village name Bánfalu was used. After the First World War, Burgenland was named Westungarn (West Hungary) in the 1919 Treaty of St. Germain and the Treaty of Trianon and was awarded to Austria in 1919. Since 1921, the town has been part of the newly founded State of Burgenland. Apetlon has been a market town since 1991.

History The DVLH had its origins in the power struggle within Die Republikaner between moderate leader Franz Schönhuber and his more extreme deputy Harald Neubauer, which culminated in Schönhuber being forced to temporarily resign in 1990.Mudde, The Ideology of the Extreme Right, Manchester University Press, 2000, p. 34 However he soon gained the upper hand and, returning to the leadership, forced Neubauer out of the party and replaced him as vice-chairman with Rolf Schlierer. With Neubauer and a number of his followers purged, they regrouped in January 1991 under the banner of the Deutsche Allianz-Vereinigte Rechte, before adopting the DVLH sobriquet later that same year. The new group had the declared aim of uniting the many factions on the far-right under a single banner and initially had some success, attracting three Republikaner MEPs (Johanna Grund, Peter Köhler and Hans-Günther SchodruchHans-Joachim Veen, Norbert Lepszy, Peter Minch, The Republikaner party in Germany: right-wing menace or protest catchall?, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1993, pp. 27-8) and the support of the influential Nation Europa journal.Mudde, The Ideology of the Extreme Right, p. 35 Neubauer, Rudolf Kendzia and Jürgen Schützinger were part of a three-man leadership team. Although former NPD chiefs Martin Mussgnug and Franz Glasauer were also given leading roles the new group made little impression in the state elections of 1992, the first in which it ran candidates.Veen, Lepszy & Minch, The Republikaner party in Germany, p. 27 It gained its first political representation that same year when a German People's Union (DVU) member of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen state legislature joined the party. During the 1990s other DVU members in Schleswig-Holstein also joined the party, although the process went into decline from 1995 as they returned to the DVU. In the 1996 election the party captured only 0.2% of the Schleswig-Holstein vote, underlining their decline in the area. As a result, the group ceased to organise as a political party in 1997, continuing as a political association. Despite this, they ran in local elections in 2004, capturing 6.2% of the vote and two seats in Villingen-Schwenningen.

He was appointed as the Secretary General of the World Organization of the Scout Movement from April 1, 2004 through November 30, 2007.  Life  Dr. Missoni received his medical training and specialty in tropical medicine from Rome University. He subsequently obtained a master's degree from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. He is a professor at Bocconi University Management School in Milan. His area of teaching and research is related to health development cooperation management and global strategies for health. He began his career as a volunteer doctor in Nicaragua. He was later employed as a UNICEF officer in Mexico. He worked for the Italian government in the capacity of adviser and representative for health cooperation programs in Latin America and sub- Saharan Africa. As a youth in Italy Dr. Missoni joined the Scout movement. Later, as a young adult he became a Scout leader and remained active in Scouting until he left for his medical mission in Nicaragua. Many years later, without having applied for the position, he was \\"headhunted\\" on behalf of the World Scout Committee and was selected as the new Secretary General of WOSM. He took office April 1, 2004. WOSM crisis On October 15, 2007, a group of National Scouting Organizations wrote an open letter of complaint to the World Scout Committee. The main complaints were that the World Scout Bureau was not focusing on National Scouting Organizations, especially those in developing countries and that there were governance and management issues within the World Scout Bureau. Two days later, the Boy Scouts of America sent a letter to the WSC reiterating their position and stating that they would withhold funding to the WSB until the current Secretary General was replaced and appropriate processes instituted to restore the WSB its core mission. Svenska Scoutrådet followed with a similar letter. The World Scout Foundation, which had been instituted to insure a reliable funding source for the movement, followed suit. The World Scout Committee wrote an uncirculated response to these requests on October 24. Several National Scout Organizations expressed concern at this economic coercion. On November 12, 2007, the World Scout Committee met in Cairo and relieved Missoni from his position as Secretary General, despite his opposition and that of many committee members. He was to maintain representative duties until November 30. On November 30, 2007, Eduardo Missoni wrote a chronology of what he called a \\"putsch\\" on his personal web page, releasing many documents which were unknown at the time and giving his point of view.

Akenfield is a film made by Peter Hall in 1974, based loosely upon the book Akenfield: Portrait of an English Village by Ronald Blythe (1969). Blythe himself has a cameo role as the vicar and all other parts are played by real-life villagers who improvised their own dialogue. There are no professional actors in the piece. The director's father Reg Hall, a station master born in Bury St Edmunds, appears briefly as the village policeman walking down a lane with a bicycle. Blythe's book is the distillation of interviews with local people, and his technique is somewhat echoed in the pioneering verbatim theatre style developed in London Road at the National Theatre in 2011. Akenfield the film is a work of fiction, based on an 18-page story synopsis by Blythe. Most of the filming was done at weekends, when the cast was available, and shooting took almost a year – following the changing seasons in the process. The music was intended to be written by Benjamin Britten, himself a Suffolk man, but he suffered a heart attack and was unable to work. Instead, Hall chose Michael Tippett, also from East Anglia, and a friend and colleague – they had worked together at London's Royal Opera House. Tippett's Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli plays a major role in the emotional timbre of the film. Background The preliminaries to filming were particularly protracted, and Blythe had many reservations about the difficulties in making a film showing \\"three generations in terms of work, belief, education and climate. For this is what Akenfield is really concerned with\\".Blythe, Ronald. Home move: the filming of Akenfield. The Countryman, Summer 1973, p113-121. Akenfield is a made-up placename based partly upon Akenham (a small village just north of Ipswich, the county town of Suffolk) and probably partly on Charsfield, a village just outside the small town of Wickham Market, Suffolk, about ten miles north-east of Akenham. The film of Akenfield was made on location in the villages just west of Wickham Market, notably Hoo, Debach, Charsfield, Monewden, Dallinghoo, Letheringham, Burgh and Pettistree. The actors in the film were non- professional, drawn from the local population, and therefore speak with authentic accents and play their parts in a manner unaffected by the habit of stage or screen performance. After making the film, most returned to usual rural occupations. Ronald Blythe's book of Akenfield is a gritty work of hard scholarship, rooted in detailed statistical data, presenting a very realistic grounded understanding of the economic and social life of a village. Life in Ronald Blythe's written Akenfield is less anecdotal than, for instance, John Moore's Brensham or Elmbury. The film is a remarkable translation of this scholarly view into a portrait of a rural community told through the eyes of one of its members. In seeing through his eyes, we also see through the eyes of his ancestors. Blythe had spent the winter of 1966–7 listening to three generations of his Suffolk neighbours in the villages of Charsfield and Debach, recording their views on education, class, welfare, religion, farming and also death. Published in 1969, the book painted a picture of country living at a time of change – its stories told in the voices of the farmers and villagers themselves. Such was its power that Akenfield was translated into more than 20 languages, including Swedish. It became required reading in American and Canadian high schools and universities. In 1999 Penguin re- published it as a Twentieth-Century Classic, which helped bring it to a new audience of readers. In discussions prior to filming Blythe and Hall talked about Robert Bresson's films of French rural life and Man of Aran. One of the major challenges of the filming was to recreate the sense of a rural economy based around horses; Blythe considered one of the best scenes the evocation of a harvest around 1911, complete with \\"Suffolk waggons, the biggest in England, and heroic punches to draw them\\". The film lasts 98 minutes.  Plot  The central character Tom (Garrow Shand) is a young man living alone in a cottage with his widowed mother (Peggy Cole) in the 1970s. The setting is within the few days surrounding the funeral of Tom's grandfather, who was born and grew up in the village in the early 1900s, experienced much poverty and hard work, fought in the First World War (where he lost most of his comrades), returned, made a failed attempt to escape the village by walking to Newmarket for a job, took a wife in the village and lived in a tied cottage on the farmer's estate for the rest of his life. His son, Tom's father, was killed in the Second World War, and Tom has grown up hearing all sorts of stories from his grandfather. Everyone around him says what a good old boy his grandfather was, and remembers the old days, but all Tom can hear is the words of his grandfather ringing in his ears, and now in 1974 he is making his own plans to get away, with or without his girlfriend. The cycle goes round and round, and all the time the customs and the landscape are so colourful and beautiful, with prominent and striking use of music by Michael Tippett (Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli), but with the skull-like menace of poverty, entrapment and war grinning through the veil of rural beauty. Will Tom be defeated by the land and the hard work, just as his grandfather was? Shand plays all three generations, grandfather, father and son.  Literary environment  * For East Anglian folklore, perhaps in such scenes as 'Hollering largesse', there is an allusion to the work of John Glyde Jnr in The New Suffolk Garland. * Past and present, and the experiences of successive generations, merge in the way suggested by T. S. Eliot in East Coker, in an eternal recurrence through cameos and flashbacks. * A courtship scene in which the future bride steals the clothes of a young man while he is swimming in the river, and is then chased by him naked across the fields, is borrowed from H.E. Bates' Uncle Silas story The Revelation (My Uncle Silas, 1939). * A scene in which the grandfather as a young man is reaping, and weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, is derived from a Thomas Bewick tail-piece (pictured) in his History of British Birds. This is a homage to the oral historian George Ewart Evans of Blaxhall, a village near to Charsfield, who used the Bewick image on the title page of his first Blaxhall study Ask the Fellows Who Cut The Hay (Faber and Faber, London 1956).

Indeed, Zeus himself is said to have transformed himself into an eagle on occasion. From these divine associations, the eagle came to be used as an emblem of several rulers, from the Achaemenids to Alexander the Great and the Diadochi, and finally of the Roman emperors. The eagle holding Zeus' lightning became the chief symbol (aquila) of the Roman legions. Legends There are two schools of thought regarding the origin of this eagle, coming from different Greek legends. =Periphas= Tetradrachm of Perseus of Macedon According to Antoninus Liberalis, Periphas was a legendary king of Attica who was a just king, and a dutiful priest of Apollo. Zeus however became indignant because Periphas was revered and honoured as if he were Zeus himself, so Zeus wanted to destroy Periphas and his entire household. But Apollo interceded, and instead Zeus transformed Periphas into an eagle, making him king of all birds and guard of his sacred sceptre.Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 6, pp. 118-121; Cook 1925, pp. 1121 ff.. =Creation of Gaia= In other accounts the eagle was in fact an ancient creation of the goddess Gaia. He appeared before Zeus at the start of the Titanomachy. Zeus took this to mean a good omen of victory, leading to him using the emblem of a golden eagle on his war standard: > \\"...For so happy an omen, especially since victory did ensue, he made a > golden eagle for his war standards and consecrated it to the might of his > protection, whereby also among the Romans, standards of this kind are > carried.\\" — a translated excerpt from Fulgentius' \\"Mythologies\\" > (Mythologiarum Libri III) Notes References * Antoninus Liberalis, The Metamorphoses of Antoninus Liberalis: A Translation with Commentary, Edited and translated by Francis Celoria, Psychology Press, 1992. * Cook, Arthur Bernard 1925, Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion, Volume 2, Part 2, Cambridge University Press, 2010. . * Smith, William; Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, London (1873). \\"Periphas 5.\\" * Category:Greek mythology Category:Zeus Category:Eagles ","title":"Eagle of Zeus"},{"id":"10754649","text":"Takaotozan Railway funicularThe is a transport company in Hachiōji, Tokyo, Japan.

It has role-playing video game and world-controlling elements, and allows the player to follow a number of characters (such as Asuka Langley Soryu, Shinji Ikari, Pen², etc.) through multiple versions of the main plot of the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. The PlayStation Portable port was released 2006-04-27 as Neon Genesis Evangelion 2 -Another Cases-. The 24 topics were named in total \\"Classified Information\\" (Kimitsu Jouhou). The topics considerably expand upon the back-story: Adam and Lilith are settlers sent to Earth in what would become Earth's moon by a \\"First Ancestral Race\\", with \\"Seeds\\" and Spears of Longinus. The various Angels seek out the Black Moon of Lilith because they are seeking Lilith, or Adam; and so on. While the information seems to have been based on extensive interviews with Hideaki Anno, creator of the franchise, the canonicity of the information in the game has never been officially stated, as the involvement of the original Gainax staff was limited to the Classified Information material. However, Gainax continuously states that all necessary information has been provided in the series and film. \\"To solve the mysteries you must understand the world of Eva itself. The Eva 2 game draws you into the world of Eva once again. During production, the developers did their best to understand everything about Eva, and tried to incorporate what they learned into the game. Without their efforts, it would've been impossible to re-create the world of Eva. Hiroshi Shibamura of Alfa System prepared a thick questionnaire and conducted an interview with Hideaki Anno, the director of both the TV series and the films, that lasted more than ten hours. The interview included questions such as, \\"What do you think about each of the Gundam series?\\" (to help program the \\"Anno AI\\" in the game) and \\"What was the first Angel?\\" (to further understand the story behind Eva). Director Anno and his staff answered the questions frankly, and the game reflects that. However, it won't be easy to find answers. The quickest way to gather clues is to play the game repeatedly in as many different roles as possible. There are some deceptive characters, such as Gendou (you can never tell whether he's telling the truth). And after all of the hard work, much of the information obtained may turn out to be contradictory or just plain false. That is because a correct answer from the standpoint of one particular character isn't necessarily correct from the standpoint of another. On the other hand, mystery-solving is only a part of it. Instead of trying so hard to find the right answers, just keep playing around in the puzzling world of Eva to discover clues about the \\"Official Answer,\\" which GAINAX is said to have presented in the game.\\" Besides the additional information, Neon Genesis Evangelion 2 also introduced a number of additions like F-type Equipment and the final products of the Jet Alone project (as in some storylines, the A HUMAN WORK episode does not end in the cancellation of the Jet Alone project), and includes several \\"Scenarios\\", including of comedic value, that disregard canon. Only Scenario 01, one of Shinji's scenarios, follows the series' own storyline relatively closely. Gameplay The player controls the Eva walking around a large map, until they run into an enemy. The player is then given a list of action commands which they can choose to attack the enemy. Once one of the action commands is chosen, a sequence will be shown, created by CGI depicting the attack. This was one of the most praised elements of the game. The game also has story arcs in which the player has a list of playable characters to choose from, to play as in the story mode. For example, the 3 main characters Shinji Ikari, Rei Ayanami, and Asuka Langley Soryu, are available from the start. More are unlocked as various game events are triggered.

He would be trapped there for fifteen years. Upon returning to England, a book allegedly recounting his memoirs would be published in his name in 1729. Though it was an instant success, the credibility of the details in the book would be put into question by later historians. Modern scholars have proven though that many details in the book are authentic and that the story itself is one of the oldest written historical accounts of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century. Robert Drury's Journal 1897 Early life Robert was born at Crutched Friars in the Tower Hamlets area of London, and later moved to the Old Jewry near Cheapside, where his father ran an Inn called The King's Head. At the age of thirteen his father secured passage for him on the ship Degrave headed for India.  Shipwrecked and marooned  = The Degrave = The Degrave left port in February 1701 reaching India safely four months later. On the return voyage it ran aground near Mauritius, and the crew was forced to abandon ship in Madagascar on the southernmost tip of the island, having not reached the Cape of Good Hope. The local Antandroy king Andriankirindra gave the sailors a fine welcome, but intended on keeping them captive to increase his standing among the other Antandroy kings. = Adventures With the Antandroy = The now captive sailors attempted to escape Andriankririndra to the east where Abraham Samuel, a black native of Martinique, reigned over the Antanosy tribes near what is now Fort-Dauphin. The first mate John Benbow and a few others were able to escape but most of the surviving crew were killed in the attempt. A couple of youths, Drury included, were spared and recaptured. Robert was then given to the king Andriamivaro as his slave. A reluctant slave at first, Robert eventually moved his way up from agricultural work to become a cow herd and eventually the royal butcher. He stayed there for what seems to have been 10 years. In the following years war broke out with the neighbouring ethnicity to the west, the Mahafaly. This was followed by a fratricidal civil war between Andriamivaro, and his uncles and cousins which included the High King of the Androy. An emissary from the Sakalava king of Fiherenana (part of the Menabe kingdom) broke the civil war by proposing a joint attack against the Mahafaly. This emissary also spoke to Drury, convincing him that if he fled to Fiherenana they would help him on to the first British ship they found. Robert then escaped and found refuge with Andrianafarana, a rival Antandroy king. He then fled from this master as well and, travelling north through Bara country, he found the Onilahy river and followed it to St Augustine's bay, now the city of Toliara in south-west Madagascar, and the capital of the Fiherenana. = Surviving on the West Coast = Upon reaching the west coast, Robert was able to meet and socialise with a community of stowaways both black and white. After further warring between his new masters, the Antandroy allies and their Mahafaly enemies, Drury was forced to find refuge further north, this time in the court of the legendary Andriamanetriarivo, king of Menabe, brother of the great king Andriamandisoarivo of the Boina. These two brothers built kingdoms which would dominate most of the island from the west coast well into the interior. Eventually, through his new European friends, news would return to his father who asked a certain Captain Mackett to go to the coast to have him returned to England on his ship, the Masselage. This ship's primary goal though was to buy slaves from the Boina Kingdom in north-west Madagascar. Later life and journal Robert arrived in England finally on 9 September 1717 after sixteen years. Unfortunately his parents were already dead. He then returned to Madagascar to become a slave trader. He may have even eventually also become a pirate for some time. In the end though he was known to be a common porter at East India House. He was said also to hang out at Old Tom's Coffee House in Birchin Lane telling tales of his adventures in Madagascar. Drury published his memoirs under the title Madagascar, or Robert Drury's Journal in 1729. It was highly praised at the time and went through seven editions until 1890. But suspicion began to rise concerning its authenticity due to its paraphrasing of many parts of the book on the History of Madagascar by Etienne de Flacourt in 1658. Also, Drury had the same publisher as Daniel Defoe and notably the same literary style. The Journal may be in fact a fiction by Defoe based on information from Flacourt's book. Many authorities who know the Androy and Mahafaly regions well are convinced though that the story proves its creator had a very intimate knowledge of the region. These include : * Dr Lotte Schomerus-Gernbock (1970), an ethnologist who lived a number of years in the Mahafaly region. * Raymond K. Kent, Professor of History, University of California, Berkeley. * Mike Parker Pearson (1996), archaeologist at Sheffield University. He has argued for the authenticity of Drury's Journal. Among the most important works was that of Mike P. Pearson, who found archaeological evidence of many parts of Drury's account. These discoveries are described in his book In Search of the Red Slave. Other researchers conclude that Drury's book was based partially on the work of Flacourt and others, but primarily on the journal of John Benbow, fellow sailor on the Degrave and son of Admiral Benbow. Benbow escaped to Fort Dauphin and sailed home aboard a Dutch ship; a few other Degrave survivors were picked up by pirate John Halsey. Benbow penned a journal of his experiences, which was lost in a 1714 fire but may have been seen by Defoe. Robert Drury died sometime between the third (1743) and fourth (1750) editions of his Journal.

Its name means bridge new village, whereas the Hungarian version means royal bridge, and the royal refers to King Francis I. Historically and geographically, Bruckneudorf represents the extension of the Austrian town of Bruck an der Leitha over the Austrian border into Hungary. This border, symbolised by the river Leitha, separated the Austrian Empire from the Kingdom of Hungary (Cisleithania and Transleithania). Its main current national significance derives from the Bruckneudorf military exercise ground of the Austrian federal army. Currently it is also the site of Bruck an der Leitha railway station, an important railway station near the borders with Hungary and Slovakia, a stop for nearly all the international trains that pass through it.  History  Together with the rest of Burgenland, the municipality was in Hungary (under the name of German West Hungary) until 1920/21. From 1898, although a largely German speaking area, it was required to take the Hungarian name of Királyhida as part of the Hungarian language policy of the national government in Budapest. After World War I, under the treaties of St. Germain and Trianon, German West Hungary was transferred to Austria (see History of Burgenland). In Roman times the area was already densely populated, and Villa Bruckneudorf, one of the most important Roman villas to be discovered in Eastern Austria, is a few kilometres to the east.

He was previously an imperial prince in the short-lived state of Xu (許), which was ruled by his brother Yuwen Huaji.  During Emperor Wen's reign  It is not known when Yuwen Shiji was born. He was a son of the Sui Dynasty general and official Yuwen Shu, and he had at least two older brothers, Yuwen Huaji and Yuwen Zhiji (宇文智及). During the reign of Sui's founder Emperor Wen, Yuwen Shiji was, on account of his father's contributions to Sui, created the Duke of Xincheng County (新城县公). On one occasion, Emperor Wen took Yuwen Shiji into his bedroom to converse with him privately, and he was impressed by Yuwen Shiji sufficiently that he gave his granddaughter the Princess Nanyang (南陽公主) (the daughter of his son Yang Guang the Crown Prince) to Yuwen Shiji in marriage. They had one son, Yuwen Chanshi (宇文禪師). Because he married a princess, he looked down at his brother Yuwen Zhiji, but appeared to have a cordial relationship with Yuwen Huaji.  During Emperor Yang's reign  In 604, Emperor Wen died and was succeeded by Yang Guang (as Emperor Yang). Yuwen Shiji's activities early in Emperor Yang's reign were unclear. He was friendly with the general Li Yuan the Duke of Tang, and was said to have discussed much about military matters with Li Yuan. By the middle of Emperor Yang's reign, Yuwen Shiji was the director of imperial transportation. When Emperor Yang went from the eastern capital Luoyang to Jiangdu (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in 616, Yuwen Shiji followed him there. When Yuwen Shu, who also followed Emperor Yang to Jiangdu, fell ill and died later in the year, Yuwen Shiji briefly resigned to observe a mourning period for his father, but was soon returned to imperial service as the deputy minister of imperial supplies. In spring 618, Yuwen Huaji and Yuwen Zhiji, along with a number of high-level officers in Emperor Yang's elite Xiaoguo Army (驍果), were plotting a coup, but they, fearing that Yuwen Shiji, as Emperor Yang's son-in-law, would reveal the plot, did not inform Yuwen Shiji their plan. They soon launched the coup and killed Emperor Yang, declaring Emperor Yang's nephew Yang Hao the Prince of Qin emperor.  Under Yuwen Huaji's command  Yuwen Huaji retained power as regent, and he made Yuwen Shiji Neishi Ling (內史令), the head of the legislative bureau of the government. Yuwen Huaji soon abandoned Jiangdu and led the Xiaoguo Army back north, toward Luoyang. His army battled those of another rebel leader, Li Mi the Duke of Wei, but was repeatedly defeated by Li Mi. During this time, Li Yuan, who has himself taken the throne at Chang'an, establishing Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu, sent secret messengers to Yuwen Shiji, then at Liyang (黎陽, in modern Hebi, Henan), and Yuwen Shiji secretly sent messengers to him as well, offering him golden bracelets—using bracelets (環, huan, a homophone to 還, meaning \\"return\\") to show that he intended to support Tang at some point. Later, Yuwen Huaji, unable to prevail over Li Mi, crossed the Yellow River north to Wei (魏縣, in modern Handan), Yuwen Shiji suggested that he head west and submit to Tang. Yuwen Huaji refused, and instead poisoned Yang Hao and declared himself emperor of a new state of Xu. He created Yuwen Shiji the Prince of Shu (蜀王). Subsequently, when Yuwen Huaji was further forced to retreat to Liaocheng (聊城, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong), Yuwen Shiji and Feng Deyi requested permission to leave Liaocheng to collect food supplies, and the supplies he obtained allowed Yuwen Huaji to withstand attacks from the Tang general Li Shentong (李神通, Emperor Gaozu's cousin). Later, however, Yuwen Huaji was attacked by another rebel ruler, Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia, and Dou captured Liaocheng in spring 619, executing Yuwen Huaji and Yuwen Zhiji. (Initially, Dou offered to spare Yuwen Shiji's son Yuwen Chanshi, but the Princess Nanyang, reasoning that the Sui laws required that the nephews of treasonous individuals, allowed Yuwen Chanshi to be executed.) At the time Liaocheng fell, Yuwen Shiji and Feng were at Jibei (濟北, also in modern Liaocheng). Some of Yuwen Shiji's followers suggested that he gather his troops and attack Dou and try to take over the land north of the Yellow River. Yuwen Shiji refused, but instead headed to Chang'an with Feng and surrendered to Tang.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  When Emperor Gaozu received Yuwen Shiji, he initially rebuked him, but Yuwen Shiji was able to point out that they had previously been friends and that he had offered to submit earlier. Further, Yuwen Shiji's sister was by this point Emperor Gaozu's concubine, and so Emperor Gaozu made Yuwen Shiji an official. He later served under Emperor Gaozu's son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin in defeating Liu Wuzhou the Dingyang Khan, and as a result was created his old title of Duke of Xincheng County, and was given the Princess of Shouguang County (寿光县主, a relative of Emperor Gaozu, although the relationship is not clear) as his wife. Later, in 620 and 621, he followed Li Shimin in his campaign against Wang Shichong the Emperor of Zheng, at the end of which Li Shimin defeated not only Wang, but Dou Jiande as well. After Dou's defeat, the Princess Nanyang, who had become a Buddhist nun, headed back from the Xia capital Ming Prefecture (洺州, in modern Handan) to Chang'an, and she happened to encounter Yuwen Shiji at Luoyang. Yuwen Shiji wanted her back as his wife, but she refused, stating to him, \\"My clan and yours have great enmity. The only reason why I am not killing you by my own hand is that you did not participate in the treasonous plot.\\" She nevertheless ordered Yuwen Shiji to leave. Yuwen Shiji initially persisted, but she then stated, \\"You can see me again if you want death.\\" Yuwen Shiji knew that she would not yield, and therefore left her. For Yuwen Shiji's contributions in the campaign against Zheng and Xia, he was created the Duke of Ying. He was also made the Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). In 625, he was made acting Shizhong (侍中), the head of the examination bureau (門下省, Menxia Sheng), a post considered one for a chancellor, as well as the head of the household at the palace of Emperor Gaozu's crown prince Li Jiancheng. (By this point, there was an intense rivalry between Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin, although whether Yuwen Shiji participated in either of their factions is not known.)  During Emperor Taizong's reign  In summer 626, Li Shimin, fearful that Li Jiancheng was about to kill him, laid an ambush for Li Jiancheng and another brother, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, who had supported Li Jiancheng, at Xuanwu Gate and killed them. He then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to first create him crown prince and then yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong). He reorganized the government, and as part of the reorganization, Yuwen Shiji was made the Zhongshu Ling (中書令), the head of the legislative bureau and clearly a chancellor. In 627, while Yuwen Shiji retained the title of Zhongshu Ling, he was no longer actually chancellor, as he was made the commandant at Liang Prefecture (涼州, roughly modern Wuwei, Gansu). It was said that he impressed the people of Liang Prefecture with his dignity and grace, and was able to fend off attacks from Eastern Tujue. Subsequently, he was recalled to Chang'an to serve as Dianzhong Jian (殿中監), the head of the palace affairs bureau (殿中省) – a high-level post, but one not bestowed with great powers. Later, on account of illness, he was made the prefect of Pu Prefecture (蒲州, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), but was then recalled back to Chang'an to be a minor general. He was often invited to attend Emperor Taizong's feasts, but rarely spoke of what were happening at the feasts, not even to his wife. When Emperor Taizong reviewed the contributions of the officials to the founding of Tang Dynasty, he rewarded Yuwen Shiji by creating his son the Duke of Xincheng County. In or around 635, he was again Dianzhong Jian. He died in 642 and was bestowed posthumous honors and buried near the tomb of Emperor Taizong's wife Empress Zhangsun, which later would become Emperor Taizong's tomb as well. Yuwen Shiji was praised for his kindness and care for his younger brother or brothers, and his nephews. He was also generous to his relatives, particularly the ones who were poor. However, he was also said to live luxuriously and wastefully. There was also an incident in which Emperor Taizong showed his favor for a tree, and subsequently, Yuwen repeatedly praised the tree, drawing a rebuke from Emperor Taizong: :Wei Zheng often told me to stay away from flatterers. I did not know whom he was referring to, and I thought it might be you. This proves it. Yuwen Shiji apologized, but defended his position by stating that emperors did not often have people who would agree with them, and that he only wanted to make the emperor happy. Emperor Taizong did not punish him. Initially, the officials in charge of considering posthumous names recommended that he be given the posthumous name Gong (恭, \\"alert\\"). The official Liu Ji, citing Yuwen's wastefulness, rejected \\"Gong,\\" instead suggesting \\"Zong\\" (縱, \\"unvirtuous\\"), and that became Yuwen's posthumous name.

It is probably a collapsed limestone cavern and although it is about 12 metres deep and some 50 metres across at its widest, it is invisible from the river and the main path on the other side. History Puritan's Pit owes its notability to Willam Yeo, a Presbyterian clergyman who was installed as Rector of Wolborough in 1648 by Oliver Cromwell. Yeo was reportedly very assiduous in his duties and would walk around the town after Sunday service with a constable, to ensure that the sabbath was kept holy. After 14 years, however he was deprived of his living for refusing to acknowledge the post-Restoration Act of Uniformity. In the years that followed, Yeo and his supporters met in Puritan's Pit by night to worship. At this time he was effectively an outlaw as can be seen from an order of sessions that was made in 1683 offering a reward of 40 shillings to anyone who apprehended a dissenting minister. The Act of Toleration 1689 brought this episode to a close, and Yeo's house was certified to be used as a place of worship. Today, the pit can be accessed via a steep path on the south side of the river. The bottom of the pit is covered with large limestone boulders and the remains of trees that have fallen in.

Born in Frankfurt, Germany into a distinguished rabbinical family, Bezalel Rakow was a direct descendant of Rabbi Yomtov Lipman Heller, (author of the Tosafos Yomtov commentary on the Mishnah). His father, Rabbi Yomtov Lipman Rakow, a pupil of the great Volozhin yeshiva, had been a rosh yeshiva in Frankfurt-on-Main.

Aged 18, he enrolled in Gateshead Kollel where he obtained rabbinical ordination and gained a reputation as a Talmudic scholar. In 1948, he married Miriam, daughter of Gateshead's then communal rabbi Naftoli Shakowitzky. The couple moved to Montreux, Switzerland, where he took up a position teaching in the local yeshivah.

In 1847, he took passage in one of the infamous \\"coffin ships\\" that transported Irish emigrants fleeing the Great Famine to British North America and the United States, wanting to see for himself the horrendous conditions that were leading to the deaths of so many of these passengers. He composed a withering report on his voyage now known as The Elgin-Grey Papers. When Colonial Secretary Earl Grey read this report, he forwarded it to Lord Elgin, Governor-General of Upper Canada and Lower Canada in the hope that these inhumane conditions could be improved.Moving Here, Staying Here: The Canadian Immigrant Experience at Library and Archives Canada The Passenger Act of 1847 made \\"coffin ships\\" illegal, though many still operated. De Vere became a Roman Catholic in 1847, and defended the re- creation of the English Catholic hierarchy in 1851. He was a Liberal Party MP for Limerick County from 1854 to 1859, and was appointed High Sheriff of County Limerick in 1870. Stephen Edward became 4th Baronet of Curragh in 1880 when his oldest brother, Vere Edmond, 3rd Baronet, died with no male heir. The Hunt/de Vere family estate for 300 years (1657–1957), including the period of the Baronetcy of Curragh, is the present day Curraghchase Forest Park, in County Limerick. Before becoming the 4th Baronet, Stephen had built a smaller house in the 1850s on Foynes Island in the River Shannon, adjacent to the port town of Foynes, less than from Curraghchase. There he wrote poems, political pamphlets and translated several editions of the works of Horace, considered by some as the best English translation of Horace's verses. He built a Gothic church in Foynes, and is buried beside it. On his death in 1904 the baronetcy became extinct. He never married and his estate, together with that of his unmarried brother Aubrey, went to their nephew Aubrey Vere O'Brien, while the Foynes Island farm went to their other nephew, Robert Vere O'Brien.

The products are mixtures of chemicals which create a polymeric layer which binds to the skin. This protects the wound by keeping dirt and germs out, and keeping moisture in.Petkewich, R. \\"Liquid Bandages\\" (2008) Chemical & Engineering News. vol. 86(24) p. 61. For the fast-acting, reactive adhesive that is used to mend deep cuts or surgery wounds, see cyanoacrylates (specifically 2-Octyl cyanoacrylate).  Design  Liquid bandage is typically a polymer dissolved in a solvent (commonly water or an alcohol), sometimes with an added antiseptic and local anesthetic, although the alcohol in some brands may serve the same purpose. These products protect the wound by forming a thin film of polymer when the carrier evaporates. Polymers used may include polyvinylpyrrolidone (water based), ethyl cellulose, pyroxylin/nitrocellulose or poly(methylacrylate-isobutene- monoisopropylmaleate) (alcohol based), and acrylate or siloxane polymers (hexamethyldisiloxane or isooctane solvent based). In addition to their use in replacing conventional bandages in minor cuts and scrapes, they have found use in surgical and veterinary offices, as they cause less trauma, and do not have to be removed like sutures (stitches) and staples do. Liquid bandages are increasingly finding use in the field of combat, where they can be used to rapidly stanch a wound until proper medical attention can be obtained.  Recent developments  A novel type of liquid bandage would incorporate amino acids to form peptide links directly with the skin. This product has potential to reduce bleeding during and after surgery.

It is located between Becket Street to the west and Hollybush Row to the east, with St Thomas Street opposite. Overview The south wall of the church The church was founded in the 12th century, dedicated to St Thomas Becket. The building still retains some of its original architecture, although substantial expansions and repairs have been made, particularly in the 17th century (under the curacy of Robert Burton) and in the 19th century. The church played a significant role in the early stages of the Oxford Movement, being the site of daily services as well as such ritualist practices as altar candles and the wearing of Eucharistic vestments. The leaders of the Movement preached at the church, and the early Tractarians were closely associated with St Thomas's. History =To the Restoration= It has traditionally been held in Osney that the church was founded in the reign of Stephen, but this is unlikely to be true, as Thomas Becket was not martyred until some fifteen years after Stephen's death. It is known that in the 1180s, the site was granted to the canons of the nearby Osney Abbey, and a chapel was erected on the site around 1190. From the mid-13th century the Osney area was referred to as the parish of St Thomas', but it remained nominally a chapel of the abbey until the dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, when it was placed under Christ Church, Oxford. Christ Church treated it as a conventional parish church with a curate, and from the mid-19th century the incumbent was styled a vicar. The 13th-century priest's door in the south wall. After the curacy was placed under the patronage of Christ Church, the incumbents were mostly scholars or members of the college; from 1616 to 1640 the curacy was held by Robert Burton, author of The Anatomy of Melancholy, who enlarged the church. In the English Civil War the medieval stained glass in the church was destroyed, partly due to the vandalism of Parliamentarian troops captured at Cirencester in 1642 and imprisoned in the church. Following the Restoration the holders of the curacy changed rapidly, often remaining in the position for only a few years at a time. From at least 1713 Christ Church leased a house in High Street to parish trustees and the profits were used for repairing the church. This continued until 1923, when the house was sold. =19th and 20th centuries= By the early 19th century, the church and its parish were showing signs of neglect. In 1802 only ten communicants are recorded, and in 1814 some 90% of the parish was thought to be non-churchgoing. The parish was further reduced by the creation of the parishes of St Paul's in 1837, St Barnabas' in 1869, and St Frideswide's in 1873. The curate from 1823 to 1842, one John Jones, brought a significant turnaround in attendance; perhaps the most unusual innovation was a houseboat – the \\"Boatmans' Floating Chapel\\" – acquired in 1839, for use as a chapel serving the families working on the river and the Oxford Canal. This boat was St Thomas' first chapel of ease; it was donated by H. Ward, a local coal merchant, and used until it sank in 1868. It was replaced by a chapel dedicated to St Nicholas that remained in use until 1892. A second chapel was built in 1860, dedicated to St Frideswide, later replaced by the new parish church of St Frideswide's, which took on the parish of New Osney in 1873. Major repairs were carried out beginning in 1825. The floor-level was raised above flood-level, a full three feet. The roof was rebuilt, the south wall was rebuilt using the original materials, and the main features of the 12th-century chancel arch were discarded. The vicar from 1842 to 1892 was Thomas Chamberlain (later founder of St Edward's School), a firm believer in the Tractarian movement, who introduced daily services as well as such ritualist practices as altar candles and the wearing of Eucharistic vestments – the latter causing him to be rebuked by Bishop Wilberforce in 1855. Many of the leaders of the Oxford Movement, including Edward Bouverie Pusey, Henry Parry Liddon, John Mason Neale, Charles Fuge Lowder and Edward King preached at the church. In the early days of the movement, Anglo- Catholicism was closely associated with St Thomas'. In 1847 Chamberlain founded the Community of St Thomas Martyr, which was devoted to the assistance of the poor of the parish, by now heavily slumland; this sisterhood remained active until 1958. The convent buildings for it were built in 1886, but have since been demolished. In 1846 the north aisle and vestry were demolished and a new aisle of five bays with a vestry at its west end was built in its place. The blocked tower arch and two blocked windows in the chancel were opened and a new chancel arch was built. The vicar from 1896 to 1908 was T.H. Birley, later Bishop of Zanzibar. In 1897 the building was again re-roofed and a vestry built against the north wall of the tower. St Thomas' was declared an ancient parish in 1948. =Present day= In September 2015 the parish was united with the neighbouring parish of St Barnabas, Oxford, to form the new parish of St Barnabas and St Paul, with St Thomas the Martyr, Oxford. St Barnabas is the parish church and St Thomas is the chapel of ease. The first vicar of the new parish was Fr Jonathan Beswick. In 2019, he was succeeded by Fr Christopher Woods. Architecture Dr Burton. The church has a nave with a north aisle and vestry, a Perpendicular Gothic west tower, a chancel and a south porch. The nave was rebuilt in the late 15th or early 16th century to meet a tower of approximately the same age; it is often dated to 1521, but appears to be built on older foundations. The southern side of the nave contains what are probably thirteenth-century buttresses and a pair of Perpendicular Gothic windows. The north aisle was originally built in the 13th century, and rebuilt by H.J. Underwood in 1890; the vestry was built in the 17th century and rebuilt in 1846 to designs by Chamberlain, through the generosity of the curate, Alexander Penrose Forbes. The church has been reroofed at least twice, in 1825 and 1897. The chancel, which has a ceiling decorated by C. E. Kempe, has three windows in the style of the late 12th century, and a priest's door built into the south side circa 1250. A south porch was built in 1621 at the behest of Dr Robert Burton, whose arms are carved in the gable above the date. A candelabrum given by Ann Kendall in 1705 hangs in the chancel. The chancel ceiling was decorated with a pattern of gold stars on a blue background in 1914. Two years later, an altar was erected at the east end of the north aisle, and an aumbry placed in the north wall of the chancel. The royal arms of William IV are displayed in the tower. St Thomas' church has been a Grade II listed building since 1954. The churchyard contains Combe House, a 1702 building originally built as a school, as well as a vicarage designed in 1893 by C. C. Rolfe. The remains of an earlier Rolfe building, the 1886 Sisterhood of St Thomas, are also present; in 1974, these amounted to a single cottage and a sculptured brick gateway.

III was a Danish single-engined biplane bomber of the 1930s. The aircraft was a development of the British Hawker Horsley designed for the Danish Navy, but differed in being powered by a radial engine and having a third crew member. Two examples were built in Britain as a precursor to license production in Denmark. Financial constraints meant this was not realised and the Hawker-built examples were the only aircraft produced. They served until the German invasion of Denmark in 1940. Design and development The Hawker Dantorp was derived from the successful Hawker Horsley. Originally designed to meet Air Ministry Specification 26/23 for a day bomber powered by a single Rolls-Royce Condor liquid-cooled engine, the Horsley entered service with the Royal Air Force in September 1927. One example of the Horsley, serial number J8620, was equipped with an Armstrong Siddeley Leopard 14-cylinder twin-row air-cooled radial engine. The Leopard was the most powerful radial engine in the world at the time and in consequence promised much better performance. Meanwhile, another Horsley, J8612, had been equipped with floats and demonstrated that the aircraft could be operated from the water. The Danish Navy showed interest in these developments and, in 1930, ordered an aircraft type based on the design of the Horsley but equipped with the new engine and able to operate as a floatplane. The aircraft was to be known as the Dantorp and was given the service number H.B.III. Description The Dantorp was a large single-engined two-bay biplane of composite wood and metal construction. Unlike the two seat Horsley, it had a crew of three, with an additional crew position between the pilot and observer/gunner. The aircraft mounted a forward-facing Vickers machine gun, a Lewis gun in a Scarff ring and could carry eight bombs, two bombs, one bomb or a torpedo weighing . The aircraft was equipped to operate using interchangeable wheeled undercarriage and floats. The floats were designed as separate structures to allow for the carriage of a torpedo under the fuselage. Operational history The first Dantorp, serial number 201, was first flown on 19 September 1932, equipped with a wheeled undercarriage. The second, 202, followed shortly afterwards and was first tested with floats in November 1932. The aircraft were flown extensively in Denmark from 1933, but it took until 1935 for there to be good results from launching torpedoes. They were also tested as catapult-launched floatplanes for operations off warships. However, these trials did not lead to the adoption of the tactic by the Navy. The aircraft continued to be flown for the rest of the decade and both aircraft were operational when Germany invaded Denmark in 1940 although their subsequent history is unknown. The Danish Navy purchased a licence to build a further ten aircraft at the Danish Naval Workshops (Orlogsvaerftet), but a shortage of funds meant that the license was not taken up and no further aircraft were produced.

A. Friedlander in 1844. The Amber Witch is a German novel published by Wilhelm Meinhold (1797–1851) in 1838. Its German title is Maria Schweidler, die Bernsteinhexe. The novel was originally published as a literary hoax which purported to be an actual 17th-century chronicle. Meinhold later admitted to the hoax but had some difficulty in proving that he was its author. In 1844, it was published in Britain as The Amber Witch in two English translations: one by E. A. Friedlander and another, more enduring, translation by Lucie, Lady Duff-Gordon.Introduction to a 1928 edition of Mary Schweidler: The Amber Witch, published by H. Milford, Oxford University Press, p. viii. Lady Duff Gordon's translation was very popular with the Victorians and went through numerous editions, including a luxurious one in 1895 illustrated by Philip Burne-Jones. The novel was a favourite of Oscar Wilde's when he was a boy,Wilde, Oscar (1998) p. 3. and in 1861 it was made into an opera, The Amber Witch, composed by William Vincent Wallace. Wallace's opera has faded into obscurity, but the novel on which it was based has continued to be republished, both on its own and in anthologies. Background Apparition on the Streckelberg, an illustration by Philip Burne-Jones for an 1895 edition of The Amber Witch. Meinhold claimed to have discovered a manuscript written by a 17th-century minister, Abraham Schweidler (purportedly a pastor of Coserow and known for his fire and brimstone sermons) amongst rubbish in the choir of the old Coserow church. The manuscript contained the story of the pastor's daughter Maria, the \\"Amber Witch\\". The tale was described by Meinhold, in the subtitle of the novel, as \\"the most interesting trial for witchcraft ever known\\".Laurita, Paula. When it first appeared, almost all of the German critics believed it was an authentic historical document.Agnew and Bidwell (1850) p.419. The work attracted critical notice, not only for the dramatic nature of its narrative but also for disputes about which parts of it were original and which were Meinhold's reconstructions, written in imitation of the 17th-century style.Warner (1902/2008) p. 9854. Meinhold's intention was to set a trap for the disciples of David Strauss and his school, who pronounced the Bible to be a collection of legends from historical research assisted by internal evidence.Agnew and Bidwell (1850) p. 419. In a direct challenge to these \\"modern documentary critics\\", Meinhold wrote in his preface to The Amber Witch: Only in a later edition did the author admit that the tale was entirely imaginary. His admission that it was a hoax was at first rejected but was soon accepted as the truth. As The Times wrote in the late 1840s: The hoax was done with great skill and attention to detail, using language that would have been used in 17th-century Germany. Writer Seabury Quinn wrote an article in the August 1925 issue of Weird Tales in which, unaware of the hoax, he recounted the plot of The Amber Witch as if it were an actual historical event.Fabrizio Foni, Alla fiera dei mostri: racconti pulp, orrori e arcane fantasticherie nelle riviste italiane, 1899-1932\`. Tunué, 2007. (p. 198). Plot The story is set during the Thirty Years' War. The purported author, Reverend Abraham Schweidler, almost loses his only child, Maria, to a plot by a rejected suitor, Sheriff Appelmann, who has accused Maria of practicing witchcraft. In this he was aided by an evil and jealous woman of the neighborhood. After a trial and under threat of the most dire torture, Maria, wholly innocent of the crime, confesses. While on her way to the stake, she is rescued by a courageous young nobleman who loves her and who exposes the evil plot against her.

A variety of creative teams followed, with Lee, Thomas, Conway and Len Wein individually writing or collaborating on stories before Mike Friedrich became regular writer with issue #14 (Dec. 1972). Pencilers included Dan Adkins, Rich Buckler, Gil Kane, and John Buscema, plus a Buscema-Neal Adams collaboration on one issue. The feature ended with #20 (Oct. 1973). Bobbi Morse first appeared in the Ka-Zar story in Astonishing Tales #6 (June 1971) and would later become the superheroine Mockingbird. Joshua Link was introduced in Astonishing Tales #8 and later became the supervillain Gemini of Zodiac. Issues #12 and #13 introduced Man-Thing to color comics, as a Ka-Zar antagonist. Issue #14 featured a censored color reprint of the black-and-white Ka-Zar tale in the comics magazine Savage Tales #1 (May 1971). Two issues contained backup- feature reprints of 1950s jungle stories from Marvel predecessor Atlas Comics: two stories from Lorna the Jungle Girl #14 (July 1955) in Astonishing Tales #9, and a Jann of the Jungle story from Jungle Tales #2 (Nov. 1954), in Astonishing Tales #14. =It! and Deathlok= Astonishing Tales #25 (Aug. 1974). Cover art by Rich Buckler and Klaus Janson. Astonishing Tales #21–24 (Dec. 1973–June 1974) featured \\"It! The Living Colossus\\",Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 161: \\"It, the immense stone statue from Tales of Suspense #14 (Feb. 1961), won his own series in Astonishing Tales #21.\\" starring a stone giant introduced in an anthological science fiction-monster story in Tales of Suspense #14 (Feb. 1961), with a sequel in issue #20 (Aug. 1961). Tony Isabella and Dick Ayers comprised the modern feature's writer-artist team. The final feature in Astonishing Tales starred and introduced Deathlok, a conflicted cyborg who predated the popular movie character RoboCop by several years and has become one of the most enduring Marvel characters among those introduced in the 1970s; at least two major iterations of the character, featuring different individuals, starred in series in the 1990s and 2000s. Created by artist Rich Buckler, who devised the initial concept, and writer Doug Moench,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 166: \\"Created by artist Rich Buckler and writer Doug Moench, the original Deathlok was Colonel Luther Manning, a soldier in an alternate, post-apocalyptic future.\\" the feature ran from #25–28 and 30–36 (Aug. 1974 – Feb. 1975 and June 1975 – July 1976), the final issue. Bill Mantlo scripted issues #32–35, with Buckler himself scripting the finale. Buckler described Deathlok as \\"an extension of a paranoid fantasy. He was a representation of part of my outlook and world view. He was a culmination of many of the messages in some of the music of the time. He was part of some of the things going wrong in our country at the time. Maybe he was the science that was going wrong. Artist George Pérez made his professional comics debut with a two-page backup feature in issue #25. The last two issues were released in both a 25-cent and a 30-cent edition.Astonishing Tales #36 at the Grand Comics Database Issue #29 (April 1975) was a fill-in that reprinted an edited version of the first Guardians of the Galaxy story, from Marvel Super-Heroes #18 (Jan. 1969). In addition to Astonishing Tales' sister publication, Amazing Adventures vol. 2, Marvel announced plans in 1970 for a never-realized third split book featuring Doctor Strange and Iceman. =Volume 2= In 2008 and 2009, Marvel produced 11 webcomics starring different characters under the umbrella title Astonishing Tales:Marvel Digital Comics (Online) at the Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: *Astonishing Tales: Daredevil (2009) *Astonishing Tales: Dominic Fortune (2009) *Astonishing Tales: Iron Man (2008) *Astonishing Tales: Iron Man 2020 (2008–2009) *Astonishing Tales: M.O.D.O.K.

Golden (2011) proposed that 薛 Xue's Old Turkic form Sir derived from Sanskrit Śrī \\"fortunate, auspicious\\" = Yantuo = The etymology of Yantuo 延陀 is much debated. It was first identified with Tarduš, one of two divisions, besides Töliš, of the short-lived Xueyantuo Qaghanate, by Western Orientalists (like Vilhelm Thomsen) who considered Töliš and Tarduš to be tribal names. The ethnonym is thus reconstructable as Syr-Tardush.Theobald, Ulrich. (2013) \\"Xueyantuo 薛延陀, Syr Tarduš\\" for ChinaKnowledge.de - An Encyclopaedia on Chinese History, Literature and Art However, Chinese scholars viewed Töliš and Tarduš as names of political organizations or districts: for example, Cen Zhongmian viewed the Töliš-Tarduš division as east–west whereas Wang Jingru, citing New Book of Tang, viewed Töliš-Tarduš as north–south. H.W. Haussig (1953: 342), apud Golden (1992), disputed the Yantuo-Tarduš connection and suggested that Chinese 薛延陀 Xueyantuo and Greek Σηρίνδα Sirinda reflected one same underlying ethnonym.Golden, Peter B.

Yantuo people are probably their descendants.\\" Based on this, Bao (2010) proposed that Yantuo people were the descendants of the Alat tribe, also known as Ala-Yundluğ; therefore, the name Yantuo was probably derived from Yundluğ, and Xueyantuo can be reconstructed as Sir-Yundluğ. History Initially the Xue and the Yantuo were two separate tribes. Tongdian states that: \\"Xueyantuo is a splinter tribe from Tiele. In the time of Former Yan [emperor] Murong Jun, Xiongnu Shanyu Helaitou led his tribe, numbering 35,000, to come surrender. Yantuo are probably their descendants.

In 605, Xueyantuo were attacked by the Western Türkic Chuluo Khagan. Consequently, they abandoned the Western Turks and established their own Kaganate under a leadership of Qibi tribe's Yağmurčin Bağa-Qağan, retaining the control and income from the Turfan segment of the Silk Road. Later, Xueynatuo leader Yshbara was installed as a lesser Kagan Yetir (yeti er \\"seven tribes\\"). In the 610, Shekui (r. 610-617) ascended to the Western Turkic throne, both rulers renounced their Kagan ranks and rejoined the Western Türkic Kaganate. The next Western Türkic Tong-Yabgu-Kagan (r. 617-630) annexed all seven tribes of the Xueyantuo-headed Tiele confederation, which also included Uighur, Bayïrku, Ădiz, Tongra, Bugu and Barsil tribes. in 627 Xueyantuo leader led his tribes into the territory of the Eastern Türkic Kaganate, defeated the main force of the Kaganate led by the son of the reigning Illig Qaghan, Yukuk Shad, and settled in the valley of river Tola in the Northern Mongolia.

This Xueyantuo Kaganate was quickly recognized by the Tang Empire, as a counterweight against its enemy Eastern Türkic Kaganate.Zuev Yu.A. \\"Xueyantuo Khaganate and Kimeks.

The Xueyantuo's vast khaganate spanned from the Altai Mountains to the Gobi desert. On March 27, 630, the Xueyantuo allied with the Chinese to defeat the Eastern Qaghanate in the Yin Mountains. Illig Qaghan escaped, but was handed over to the Chinese by his subordinate qaghan on May 2.Duan, \\"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\\", p. 362, 388-389, 430.Bo Yang, \\"Zizhi Tongjian\\", p. 11,651-11,654 (Vol.46). After Eastern Göktürk Illig Qaghan Ashina Duobi was defeated by Tang in 630, the Xueyantuo effectively took over control of the Eastern Göktürks' former territory, at times submissive to the Tang and at times warring with the Tang and the subsequent khan of the Eastern Göktürks that Tang supported, the Qilibi Khan Ashina Simo. In 632 the Xueyantuo repulsed an army of Si Yabgu Qaghan from the Western Qaghanate, then subjugated the Qarluq at the Ulungur and Irtysh River, and then the Yenisei Kyrgyz tribes. In 634 one of their rivals, Dubu Qaghan (Ashina Shier), son of Chuluo Khan, who ruled much of the eastern half of the Western Qaghanate, was eliminated before escaping to China.Duan, \\"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\\", p. 414-415. After that they maintained a friendly relationship with the Chinese until 639, when a raid on the Chinese capital was planned by the Gökturks under Ashina Jiesheshuai (阿史那结社率), who had been disparaged by the Chinese emperor. He allied with his nephew Ashina Heluohu (阿史那贺逻鹘), choosing him as the leader of the raid on May 19. They were unsuccessful and over 40 rebels were executed. Heluohu was spared and expelled to the far south.Duan, \\"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\\", p. 438-439.Bo Yang, \\"Zizhi Tongjian\\", p. 11,784-11,785 (Vol.46). After this incident, an arraignment was made on August 13. A deportation of all Goktürks north of Ordos was carried out, in an attempt to restore the puppet Eastern Qaghanate as a barrier against the Xueyanto, in an attempt to distract them from the territorial competition in the west. Among the Göktürk nobles, Ashina Simo was selected as the qaghan (Qilibi Khan) with his capital at the border. The plot failed, as he was unable to gather his people, many of his tribesmen having escaped to the south by 644 after a series of unsuccessful incursions by the Xueyantuo supported by the Chinese. Defeats by the advancing Chinese had made their tribal allies lose confidence in them. The crisis deepened the next year when a coup d'état took place within the clan. On August 1, 646, the Xueyantuo were defeated by the Uyghur (Huihe, 回纥) and the Chinese. The Xueyantuo's Duomi Khan, Bazhuo, was killed by the Uyghur. A Tang army led by the general Li Daozong, the Prince of Jiangxia, crushed the Xueyantuo forces. The last Xueyantuo khan, the Yitewushi Khan Duomozhi, surrendered.Bo Yang, Outlines of the History of the Chinese (中國人史綱), vol. 2, p. 512.

The media soon labeled the event the \\"deadliest school shooting in American history.\\" In addition to the extensive, worldwide media coverage of the event, there was intense speculation immediately following the massacre over the state of mind of the perpetrator.

Thompson even went as far as blaming Bill Gates for promoting the game and ordering him to take it offline, even though Counter- Strike is owned and operated by Valve. =Television news= As the scope and relevance of the shootings quickly became apparent, the four leading broadcast networks in the United States — ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox — pre-empted regular programming (whether across a network or on its local stations) for breaking news bulletin coverage. This lasted for much of the early afternoon. Local News The local news networks in the Middle Atlantic region had extensive coverage, as many residents of the area had ties to Virginia Tech, until the evening news programs took over at 6:30pm. WTVR and WHSV used a feed from CNN during the afternoon. The Washington, DC and Roanoke area stations had their own coverage. WDBJ, WSLS, WSET, WUSA, WRC, and WJLA all had streaming online coverage for persons wanting to watch from work. WSLS started a feed at approximately 10:30am. WDBJ (the local CBS affiliate in Roanoke) had the first live shot from the campus just blocks away from Norris Hall at approximately 10:45am. WDBJ supplied CNN and their affiliates live coverage for hours until the national media arrived. Then supplied all CBS,CNN and NNS affiliates with video. WDBJ started internet coverage before 10:15am. National News Networks The specialty news channels in the U.S. — CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel — had started covering the story much earlier, mentioning the first gunshot attacks on the West Ambler-Johnston residence hall before starting much more extensive coverage when news of the shootings at Norris Hall broke. CNN first reported the AJ shooting about 10:10 a.m. ET. The channels dropped all commercial breaks until about 7 p.m. Eastern time, then aired limited commercials after that through the night. Major Networks The CBS Evening News with Katie Couric expanded to an hour that night, and NBC replaced two planned sitcom reruns with a one-hour special at 10 p.m. ET. (The sitcoms were to have replaced The Black Donnellys, which NBC had cancelled.) ABC's World News with Charles Gibson was extended by five minutes, and NBC limited commercials on NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams.Coverage Update: 60 Minutes of CBS Evening News, Ben Grossman, Broadcasting & Cable, April 16, 2007 All four broadcast networks carried the university's official convocation service the next day beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern time and lasting for about 90 minutes. That night, all three of the oldest networks had special programs. NBC went on the air at 8 p.m. ET as part of its regular Dateline NBC series, and ABC and CBS aired specials at 10 p.m. ET (the CBS show replaced 48 Hours Mysteries and the ABC program was in the regular slot for Primetime). CBS Evening News again lasted for an hour. The Associated Press The Associated Press reported one injury and one death in the Ambler Johnston shooting just before 11 a.m. ET. After the University posted on their website about the other shooting in Norris, the Associated Press then reported \\"seven to eight additional casualties\\" shortly after 11:10 a.m. This report sent the news networks into their aforementioned nonstop news coverage. =Cho's media package= The Courier-Mail, Brisbane, Australia from April 20, 2008 Newspapers around the world showed Cho's chilling images On April 18, NBC aired the videotape and some pictures that it received from the killer, Seung- Hui Cho, that afternoon. The package, which Williams called a \\"multimedia manifesto,\\" was mailed between the two shooting episodes and was received at NBC's New York headquarters that afternoon, and they reported the package to the FBI. Anticipating criticisms that the airing of the tapes was irresponsible, NBC News president Steve Capus said that reporting the story and distributing the information was a journalistic necessity, to provide context and background on Cho's possible motivations.Interviews on Hardball and Countdown, April 18, 2007. Also see http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6434943.html Some family members of the victims were upset that the photos and video sent by the killer were broadcast, and subsequently canceled interviews with NBC in protest. A Virginia State Police spokesman said he was \\"rather disappointed in the editorial decision to broadcast these disturbing images,\\"Inquiry to probe Virginia killing BBC News adding that he regretted that \\"[people who] are not used to seeing that type of image had to see it.\\" Although NBC received and first broadcast the tapes, all major broadcast and cable newscasts and channels aired portions of the tapes. The American Psychiatric Association, however, urged the media to withdraw the footage from circulation, arguing that publicizing it \\"seriously jeopardizes the public's safety by potentially inciting 'copycat' suicides, homicides and other incidents.\\" NBC defended itself by stating its staff had intensely debated releasing the footage before deciding to broadcast it and asserted it had covered this story with extreme sensitivity. Williams also emphasized that it had edited out a large amount of obscene material and that the release was cleared by federal and state authorities.NBC Nightly News, April 18 Fox News, which replayed NBC's information extensively, defended NBC's release of the materials. Most of these outlets did restrict coverage in ensuing days due to public outcry, while many Mid-Atlantic region stations decided to stop airing it altogether after the first night, because of the outcry from the public. In Canada, the CBC did not air the footage at all. At the annual meeting of NBC's parent company, General Electric, Media watchdog group Accuracy in Media sought the firing of NBC News President Steve Capus because of his decision to air the tapes. =Other commentaries= Social scientist and author Loren Coleman, has written in some detail in his same-named copycat effect blog and been extensively quoted by the media regarding the impact that the wall-to-wall coverage had in framing Cho's attack, and in the copycats in its wake. Outside the U.S. There was extensive coverage of the Virginia Tech shooting and its aftermath in countries throughout the world, with many stations and papers sending journalists to Blacksburg to cover the massacre. Dozens of newspapers around the world placed the story on the front page.Front Pages Analysis: April is the cruellest month in Iraq; murder, mayhem and a madam , Christy Mumford Jerding, Newseum, May 01, 2007 The shootings sparked the usual commentary and editorials that are customarily critical of U.S. gun laws and gun culture in the rest of the developed world. In the UK, an editorial in The Times asked, \\"Why ... do Americans continue to tolerate gun laws and a culture that seems to condemn thousands of innocents to death every year, when presumably, tougher restrictions, such as those in force in European countries, could at least reduce the number?\\"Only the names change. And the numbers, The Times, 17 April 2007 An article on the front-page of the Ottawa Citizen, advocating tougher gun control laws, similarly asked why America tolerated laws which \\"allowed thousands of innocents to be killed each year.\\"Massacre will bring a closer look at gun rules , Gerard Baker, Ottawa Citizen, April 17, 2007 The Swedish paper Göteborgs-Posten commented that \\"without access to weapons, the killings at Virginia Tech might have been prevented\\" because \\"the fundamental reason is often the perpetrator's psychological problems in combination with access to weapons.\\"U.S. gun laws draw heat after massacre, Associated Press, 18 April 2007 In Japan, the Asahi Shimbun commented that \\"the mass shooting.... reminded us once again how disturbingly common gun fatalities are in the United States,\\" and went on to note, \\"Humans become enraged and desperate, and a gun in the hands of an enraged or desperate individual could be a sure recipe of disaster or tragedy.\\"Virginia Tech massacre Asahi Shimbun, April 19, 2007 Australian Prime Minister John Howard said tough Australian legislation introduced after a 1996 mass shooting in Tasmania had prevented a problematic gun culture in Australia by showing \\"a national resolve that the gun culture that is such a negative in the United States would never become a negative in our country.\\"U.S. Gun Laws Draw Heat After Massacre, CBS NEWS, accessed April 22, 2007 Other international commentators predicted little chance of tougher gun laws or changes to the U.S. gun culture. BBC's Washington correspondent Matt Frei wrote \\"America is at its most impressive when it grieves and remembers. But will the soul-searching ever produce legislation and will it make schools safer?\\". He further predicted that \\"[d]espite this week's bloodbath there will be no overwhelming demand for gun control in this country.\\"Washington diary: Virginia shootings BBC Similarly, The Economist said: \\"The Columbine killings of 1999 failed to provoke any shift in Americans' attitudes to guns. There is no reason to believe that this massacre, or the next one, will do so either.\\"\\"Guns in America: After the massacre\\", The Economist, 17 April 2007 The first book published about the killings was La masacre de Virginia Tech: Anatomía de una mente torturada (The Virginia Tech Massacre: Anatomy of a tortured mind, ) by the Spanish journalist and author Juan Gómez-Jurado.La masacre de Virginia Tech: Anatomía de una mente Reaction on campus Students quickly grew tired of the large media presence on campus. The student government issued a statement on Sunday, April 22, the day before classes resumed, asking the media to leave campus. Students were also encouraged to decline requests for contact by the media. Media criticism of Virginia Tech President Charles Steger was quickly met by support of Steger by alumni, students and faculty. An online petition gathered 32,000 signatures with days and Steger was swarmed by supportive students as he walked the campus. On the whole, those close to university felt that in retrospect, that while the incident could have been handled differently, blaming Steger and Virginia Tech Police Chief Wendell Flinchum was unfair. Impact in entertainment *Jay Leno led the April 16 show off by sending prayers and best wishes to everyone affected. He stated that his job was to end the day on a happy note, and be a little silly, and he was going to try to do that for everyone on that day. *The massacre was mentioned three times in the April 17 episode of hit show American Idol: First, show host Ryan Seacrest expressed \\"thoughts and prayers\\" on behalf of the producers of the show and the network; contestant Chris Richardson from Chesapeake, Virginia dedicated his performance to the victims and their families; judge Simon Cowell noted \\"how difficult this week was for all of us.\\" Cowell was caught rolling his eyes on camera as a contestant was expressing sympathy for Tech victims. At first, this was misinterpreted as his showing his disrespect. Cowell later clarified that he was discussing the contestant's performance with another judge.Fox 11 Morning News, KTTV, Los Angeles, April 18, 2007.

It is located in a region to the east of the Lake Neusiedl (German: Neusiedlersee; Hungarian: Fertő tó) which is named the Seewinkel (lake corner). Geography Illmitz is in the Neusiedler See-Seewinkel National Park on the eastern shore of Lake Neusiedl. The town is at an elevation of 117 meters above sea level. Nearby, an area above sea level is the lowest elevation of Austria. Characteristic of the area are wide open plains and salt marsh flora, with many small salt lakes around. The Lange Lacke (Long Lake) is the largest of about forty such lakes nearby. History In 1897, the Austrian Empire was dissolved, and Austria-Hungary was formed, with separate governments in Vienna and Budapest. After the First World War, Burgenland was named Deutsch-Westungarn (German-West Hungary) in the 1919 Treaty of St. Germain and the Treaty of Trianon and was awarded to Austria in 1919. Since 1921, the town has been part of the newly founded State of Burgenland. In December 2001, the National Park Neusiedlersee was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Population Economy and infrastructure In Illmitz the primary business is wine production. The city is surrounded by fields with grapevines in them. Tourism also is significant. Every year in May, many ornithologists come from all over Europe to see the rare birds. Long before the establishment of the National Park, the Lange Lacke (Long Lake) already was an important nature reserve. Lange Lacke is the largest of about forty salt lakes near the town. It has more than 100 years of scientific data collected on bird life. The bird population and grape growers are in conflict, and farmers have sonic cannons in the fields to frighten birds from eating the grapes. Although a small village only, Illmitz is known to wine lovers worldwide. Winemakers such as Alois Kracher, Willi Opitz and Stefan Tschida and Salzl are famous for their noble sweet wines. Notes On highway signs, the name of the town is also spelled Jllmitz because the capital \\"I\\" and small \\"l\\" characters look similar on the Austrian Highway sign font.

Personal life Kövess' father was a senior military officer living in Temesvár, Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire (now Timișoara, Romania).https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/Lexikonok-magyar- eletrajzi-lexikon-7428D/k-760F2/kovess-hermann-baro-76730/ His mother came from Fogaras (now Făgăraș, Romania), where her Thuringian father worked as a pharmacist; her mother was a Transylvanian Saxon from Hermannstadt (now Sibiu, Romania). Entry in Neue Deutsche Biographie He married the Baroness Eugenie Hye von Glunek in 1892 and they had 3 sons; Adalbert, who was killed in action in 1914 and Géza and Jenő who served as artillery officers. Military career He enrolled into a cadet institute at Hainburg in 1865, and, after spending some time there and at the academy in Znaim, he moved to a military academy in Vienna. He passed the courses at the academy with fair success and received an accelerated promotion to captain. He led his first military expedition in 1882 on a mission to suppress a mutiny in Dalmatia and was commended by the Emperor Francis Joseph I of Austria with a Merit Medal and also received a Knights Cross of the Order of the Italian Crown that same year. After the campaign he failed his next examination and was transferred into the infantry. His good performance during his service with the infantry provided him with quick promotions to major in 1890 and then to lieutenant colonel in 1894 and soon after to colonel. He had become one of the youngest colonels in the Austro-Hungarian Army and one of the most powerful Protestants serving in a generally Roman Catholic officer corps. His Protestantism caused a scandal when he was involved in an event where 400 Roman Catholics converted to Protestantism after a dispute. The scandal was generally ignored by the military, but condemned by the Catholic Church. The condemnation led him to believe he would be prematurely retired; however, this turned out to be false due to the onset of World War I. =World War I= Kövess (fourth from right) shaking hands with Arthur Arz von Straußenburg during the 180th investiture in the history of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 17 August 1917 at Schloss Wartholz At the beginning of World War I, Kövess commanded the XII. (Transylvania) Corps, and fought in the tenacious defense against the superior Russian forces in east and central Galicia, and later in Russian Poland. During the spring offensive of 1915, he captured by storm the fortress of Ivangorod. In the autumn, under the command of August von Mackensen, he led the III. Army during the Serbian Campaign, with which he captured Belgrade and penetrated deep into Serbia. In January 1916, in independent command, he overthrew Montenegro in the Montenegrin Campaign, and also occupied Albania. In the early summer of 1916, Kövess' army cooperated in the operation against Arsiero-Asiago. But after the breakthrough of Aleksei Brusilov, he was transported in all haste to the Galician theatre of war. Kövess soon after took over the command of the VII. Army, and defended the ridges of the Wooded Carpathians against Russian attack. In the summer of 1917, Kövess sallied from the mountains with his troops, made himself master of Czernowitz and Radautz, and drove the Russians almost entirely from the Bukovina. He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal on 5 November 1917. From the middle of January to the beginning of April 1918, he commanded the army front consisting of the I. and VII. Armies, extending from the Dniester to the south-eastern corner of Transylvania. Entrusted after the withdrawal of Bulgaria with the thankless task of the command of the troops in the Balkans, Kövess could do nothing more than arrange for the evacuation of the occupied territories according to plan, and for the defence of the Danube-Sava line. When Emperor Charles laid down the supreme command, he nominated Kövess as his successor. But the dispersal of the forces closed Kövess's military career. Kövess was one of the most popular army leaders of the old monarchy. After its downfall, he lived in retirement, cultivating his historical and artistic tastes.

The van was introduced in 1967 as the logical successor for the Fiat 1100T. The 238 was based on the chassis of the Autobianchi Primula and had a downtuned version of the Fiat 124's engine. The 238 was produced in many different body styles for utility and personnel transport. In 1974 Fiat introduced a new van, the 242 with a larger petrol engine and also a diesel engine variant. Despite that the sales of Fiat 238 did not weaken and Fiat decided to keep it in its lineup, and made the new bigger 1.4-liter engine also available to the 238 model. The 238 was produced until 1983 and was replaced with Ducato. The 238 was also briefly built by Germany's Neckar-Fiat.

Not all versions of the DIKW model reference all four components (earlier versions not including data, later versions omitting or downplaying wisdom), and some include additional components. In addition to a hierarchy and a pyramid, the DIKW model has also been characterized as a chain, as a framework, as a series of graphs, and as a continuum. History Danny P. Wallace, a professor of library and information science, explained that the origin of the DIKW pyramid is uncertain: > The presentation of the relationships among data, information, knowledge, > and sometimes wisdom in a hierarchical arrangement has been part of the > language of information science for many years. Although it is uncertain > when and by whom those relationships were first presented, the ubiquity of > the notion of a hierarchy is embedded in the use of the acronym DIKW as a > shorthand representation for the data-to-information-to-knowledge-to-wisdom > transformation. while many authors agreed that DIKW, at least IKW, originated from the play The Rock by T. S. Eliot in 1934. The play contains wisdom-knowledge- information in the following lines: > Where is the Life we have lost in living? Where is the wisdom we have lost > in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information? =Data, Information, Knowledge= In 1955, English-American economist and educator Kenneth Boulding presented a variation on the hierarchy consisting of \\"signals, messages, information, and knowledge\\". However, \\"[t]he first author to distinguish among data, information, and knowledge and to also employ the term 'knowledge management' may have been American educator Nicholas L. Henry\\", in a 1974 journal article. =Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom= Other early versions (prior to 1982) of the hierarchy that refer to a data tier include those of Chinese-American geographer Yi-Fu Tuan and sociologist- historian Daniel Bell.. In 1980, Irish-born engineer Mike Cooley invoked the same hierarchy in his critique of automation and computerization, in his book Architect or Bee?: The Human / Technology Relationship. Thereafter, in 1987, Czechoslovakia-born educator Milan Zeleny mapped the elements of the hierarchy to knowledge forms: know-nothing, know-what, know-how, and know-why. Zeleny \\"has frequently been credited with proposing the [representation of DIKW as a pyramid]...although he actually made no reference to any such graphical model.\\" The hierarchy appears again in a 1988 address to the International Society for General Systems Research, by American organizational theorist Russell Ackoff, published in 1989. Subsequent authors and textbooks cite Ackoff's as the \\"original articulation\\" of the hierarchy or otherwise credit Ackoff with its proposal. Ackoff's version of the model includes an understanding tier (as Adler had, before him), interposed between knowledge and wisdom. Although Ackoff did not present the hierarchy graphically, he has also been credited with its representation as a pyramid. In the same year as Ackoff presented his address, information scientist Anthony Debons and colleagues introduced an extended hierarchy, with \\"events\\", \\"symbols\\", and \\"rules and formulations\\" tiers ahead of data. In 1994 Nathan Shedroff presented the DIKW hierarchy in an information design context which later appeared as a book chapter. Jennifer Rowley noted in 2007 that there was \\"little reference to wisdom\\" in discussion of the DIKW in recently published college textbooks, and does not include wisdom in her own definitions following that research. Meanwhile, Zins' extensive analysis of the conceptualizations of data, information, and knowledge, in his recent research study, makes no explicit commentary on wisdom, although some of the citations included by Zins do make mention of the term.Dodig-Crnković, Gordana, as cited in Zins, id., at pp. 482.Ess, Charles, as cited in Zins, id., at p. 482-83.Wormell, Irene, as cited in Zins, id., at p. 486. Description The DIKW model \\"is often quoted, or used implicitly, in definitions of data, information and knowledge in the information management, information systems and knowledge management literatures, but there has been limited direct discussion of the hierarchy\\". Reviews of textbooks and a survey of scholars in relevant fields indicate that there is not a consensus as to definitions used in the model, and even less \\"in the description of the processes that transform elements lower in the hierarchy into those above them\\". This has led Israeli researcher Chaim Zins to suggest that the data–information–knowledge components of DIKW refer to a class of no less than five models, as a function of whether data, information, and knowledge are each conceived of as subjective, objective (what Zins terms, \\"universal\\" or \\"collective\\") or both. In Zins's usage, subjective and objective \\"are not related to arbitrariness and truthfulness, which are usually attached to the concepts of subjective knowledge and objective knowledge\\". Information science, Zins argues, studies data and information, but not knowledge, as knowledge is an internal (subjective) rather than an external (universal–collective) phenomenon. Data In the context of DIKW, data is conceived of as symbols or signs, representing stimuli or signals, that are \\"of no use until...in a usable (that is, relevant) form\\". Zeleny characterized this non-usable characteristic of data as \\"know-nothing\\". In some cases, data is understood to refer not only to symbols, but also to signals or stimuli referred to by said symbols—what Zins terms subjective data. Where universal data, for Zins, are \\"the product of observation\\" (italics in original), subjective data are the observations. This distinction is often obscured in definitions of data in terms of \\"facts\\". =Data as fact= Rowley, following her study of DIKW definitions given in textbooks, characterizes data \\"as being discrete, objective facts or observations, which are unorganized and unprocessed and therefore have no meaning or value because of lack of context and interpretation.\\" In Henry's early formulation of the hierarchy, data was simply defined as \\"merely raw facts\\"., while two recent texts define data as \\"chunks of facts about the state of the world\\" and \\"material facts\\", respectively. Cleveland does not include an explicit data tier, but defines information as \\"the sum total of...facts and ideas\\". Insofar as facts have as a fundamental property that they are true, have objective reality, or otherwise can be verified, such definitions would preclude false, meaningless, and nonsensical data from the DIKW model, such that the principle of garbage in, garbage out would not be accounted for under DIKW. =Data as signal= In the subjective domain, data are conceived of as \\"sensory stimuli, which we perceive through our senses\\", or \\"signal readings\\", including \\"sensor and/or sensory readings of light, sound, smell, taste, and touch\\". Others have argued that what Zins calls subjective data actually count as a \\"signal\\" tier (as had Boulding), which precedes data in the DIKW chain. American information scientist Glynn Harmon defined data as \\"one or more kinds of energy waves or particles (light, heat, sound, force, electromagnetic) selected by a conscious organism or intelligent agent on the basis of a preexisting frame or inferential mechanism in the organism or agent.\\"Harmon, Glynn, as cited by Zins, id., at p. 483. The meaning of sensory stimuli may also be thought of as subjective data: > Information is the meaning of these sensory stimuli (i.e., the empirical > perception). For example, the noises that I hear are data. The meaning of > these noises (e.g., a running car engine) is information. Still, there is > another alternative as to how to define these two concepts—which seems even > better. Data are sense stimuli, or their meaning (i.e., the empirical > perception). Accordingly, in the example above, the loud noises, as well as > the perception of a running car engine, are data. (Italics added. Bold in > original.) Subjective data, if understood in this way, would be comparable to knowledge by acquaintance, in that it is based on direct experience of stimuli. However, unlike knowledge by acquaintance, as described by Bertrand Russell and others, the subjective domain is \\"not related to...truthfulness\\". Whether Zins' alternate definition would hold would be a function of whether \\"the running of a car engine\\" is understood as an objective fact or as a contextual interpretation. =Data as symbol= Whether the DIKW definition of data is deemed to include Zins's subjective data (with or without meaning), data is consistently defined to include \\"symbols\\", or \\"sets of signs that represent empirical stimuli or perceptions\\", of \\"a property of an object, an event or of their environment\\". Data, in this sense, are \\"recorded (captured or stored) symbols\\", including \\"words (text and/or verbal), numbers, diagrams, and images (still &/or video), which are the building blocks of communication\\", the purpose of which \\"is to record activities or situations, to attempt to capture the true picture or real event,\\" such that \\"all data are historical, unless used for illustrative purposes, such as forecasting.\\" Boulding's version of DIKW explicitly named the level below the information tier message, distinguishing it from an underlying signal tier. Debons and colleagues reverse this relationship, identifying an explicit symbol tier as one of several levels underlying data. Zins determined that, for most of those surveyed, data \\"are characterized as phenomena in the universal domain\\". \\"Apparently,\\" clarifies Zins, \\"it is more useful to relate to the data, information, and knowledge as sets of signs rather than as meaning and its building blocks\\". Information In the context of DIKW, information meets the definition for knowledge by description (\\"information is contained in descriptions\\"), and is differentiated from data in that it is \\"useful\\". \\"Information is inferred from data\\", in the process of answering interrogative questions (e.g., \\"who\\", \\"what\\", \\"where\\", \\"how many\\", \\"when\\"), thereby making the data useful for \\"decisions and/or action\\". \\"Classically,\\" states a recent text, \\"information is defined as data that are endowed with meaning and purpose.\\" =Structural vs. functional= Rowley, following her review of how DIKW is presented in textbooks, describes information as \\"organized or structured data, which has been processed in such a way that the information now has relevance for a specific purpose or context, and is therefore meaningful, valuable, useful and relevant.\\" Note that this definition contrasts with Rowley's characterization of Ackoff's definitions, wherein \\"[t]he difference between data and information is structural, not functional.\\" In his formulation of the hierarchy, Henry defined information as \\"data that changes us\\", this being a functional, rather than structural, distinction between data and information. Meanwhile, Cleveland, who did not refer to a data level in his version of DIKW, described information as \\"the sum total of all the facts and ideas that are available to be known by somebody at a given moment in time\\". American educator Bob Boiko is more obscure, defining information only as \\"matter-of-fact\\". =Symbolic vs. subjective= Information may be conceived of in DIKW models as: (i) universal, existing as symbols and signs; (ii) subjective, the meaning to which symbols attach; or (iii) both. Examples of information as both symbol and meaning include: * American information scientist Anthony Debons's characterization of information as representing \\"a state of awareness (consciousness) and the physical manifestations they form\\", such that \\"[i]nformation, as a phenomenon, represents both a process and a product; a cognitive/affective state, and the physical counterpart (product of) the cognitive/affective state.\\"Debons, Anthony, as cited in Zins, id., at p. 482. * Danish information scientist Hanne Albrechtsen's description of information as \\"related to meaning or human intention\\", either as \\"the contents of databases, the web, etc.\\" (italics added) or \\"the meaning of statements as they are intended by the speaker/writer and understood/misunderstood by the listener/reader.\\"Albrechtsen, Hanne, as cited in Zins, id., at p. 480. Zeleny formerly described information as \\"know-what\\", but has since refined this to differentiate between \\"what to have or to possess\\" (information) and \\"what to do, act or carry out\\" (wisdom). To this conceptualization of information, he also adds \\"why is\\", as distinct from \\"why do\\" (another aspect of wisdom). Zeleny further argues that there is no such thing as explicit knowledge, but rather that knowledge, once made explicit in symbolic form, becomes information. Knowledge The knowledge component of DIKW is generally agreed to be an elusive concept which is difficult to define. The DIKW definition of knowledge differs from that used by epistemology. The DIKW view is that \\"knowledge is defined with reference to information.\\" Definitions may refer to information having been processed, organized or structured in some way, or else as being applied or put into action. Zins has suggested that knowledge, being subjective rather than universal, is not the subject of study in information science, and that it is often defined in propositional terms, while Zeleny has asserted that to capture knowledge in symbolic form is to make it into information, i.e., that \\"All knowledge is tacit\\". \\"One of the most frequently quoted definitions\\" of knowledge captures some of the various ways in which it has been defined by others: > Knowledge is a fluid mix of framed experience, values, contextual > information, expert insight and grounded intuition that provides an > environment and framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences > and information. It originates and is applied in the minds of knowers. In > organizations it often becomes embedded not only in documents and > repositories but also in organizational routines, processes, practices and > norms. =Knowledge as processed= Mirroring the description of information as \\"organized or structured data\\", knowledge is sometimes described as: * \\"synthesis of multiple sources of information over time\\" * \\"organization and processing to convey understanding, experience [and] accumulated learning\\" * \\"a mix of contextual information, values, experience and rules\\" One of Boulding's definitions for knowledge had been \\"a mental structure\\" and Cleveland described knowledge as \\"the result of somebody applying the refiner's fire to [information], selecting and organizing what is useful to somebody\\". A recent text describes knowledge as \\"information connected in relationships\\". =Knowledge as procedural= Zeleny defines knowledge as \\"know-how\\" (i.e., procedural knowledge), and also \\"know-who\\" and \\"know-when\\", each gained through \\"practical experience\\". \\"Knowledge...brings forth from the background of experience a coherent and self-consistent set of coordinated actions.\\". Further, implicitly holding information as descriptive, Zeleny declares that \\"Knowledge is action, not a description of action.\\" Ackoff, likewise, described knowledge as the \\"application of data and information\\", which \\"answers 'how' questions\\", that is, \\"know-how\\". Meanwhile, textbooks discussing DIKW have been found to describe knowledge variously in terms of experience, skill, expertise or capability: * \\"study and experience\\" * \\"a mix of contextual information, expert opinion, skills and experience\\" * \\"information combined with understanding and capability\\" * \\"perception, skills, training, common sense and experience\\". Businessmen James Chisholm and Greg Warman characterize knowledge simply as \\"doing things right\\". =Knowledge as propositional= Knowledge is sometimes described as \\"belief structuring\\" and \\"internalization with reference to cognitive frameworks\\". One definition given by Boulding for knowledge was \\"the subjective 'perception of the world and one's place in it'\\", while Zeleny's said that knowledge \\"should refer to an observer's distinction of 'objects' (wholes, unities)\\". Zins, likewise, found that knowledge is described in propositional terms, as justifiable beliefs (subjective domain, akin to tacit knowledge), and sometimes also as signs that represent such beliefs (universal/collective domain, akin to explicit knowledge). Zeleny has rejected the idea of explicit knowledge (as in Zins' universal knowledge), arguing that once made symbolic, knowledge becomes information. Boiko appears to echo this sentiment, in his claim that \\"knowledge and wisdom can be information\\". In the subjective domain: > Knowledge is a thought in the individual's mind, which is characterized by > the individual's justifiable belief that it is true. It can be empirical and > non-empirical, as in the case of logical and mathematical knowledge (e.g., > \\"every triangle has three sides\\"), religious knowledge (e.g., \\"God exists\\"), > philosophical knowledge (e.g., \\"Cogito ergo sum\\"), and the like. Note that > knowledge is the content of a thought in the individual's mind, which is > characterized by the individual's justifiable belief that it is true, while > \\"knowing\\" is a state of mind which is characterized by the three conditions: > (1) the individual believe[s] that it is true, (2) S/he can justify it, and > (3) It is true, or it [appears] to be true. (Italics added. Bold in > original.) The distinction here between subjective knowledge and subjective information is that subjective knowledge is characterized by justifiable belief, where subjective information is a type of knowledge concerning the meaning of data. Boiko implied that knowledge was both open to rational discourse and justification, when he defined knowledge as \\"a matter of dispute\\". Wisdom Although commonly included as a level in DIKW, \\"there is limited reference to wisdom\\" in discussions of the model. Boiko appears to have dismissed wisdom, characterizing it as \\"non-material\\". Ackoff refers to understanding as an \\"appreciation of 'why'\\", and wisdom as \\"evaluated understanding\\", where understanding is posited as a discrete layer between knowledge and wisdom. Adler had previously also included an understanding tier, while other authors have depicted understanding as a dimension in relation to which DIKW is plotted. Cleveland described wisdom simply as \\"integrated knowledge—information made super-useful\\". Other authors have characterized wisdom as \\"knowing the right things to do\\" and \\"the ability to make sound judgments and decisions apparently without thought\\". Wisdom involves using knowledge for the greater good. Because of this, wisdom is deeper and more uniquely human. It requires a sense of good and bad, right and wrong, ethical and unethical. Zeleny described wisdom as \\"know-why\\", but later refined his definitions, so as to differentiate \\"why do\\" (wisdom) from \\"why is\\" (information), and expanding his definition to include a form of know-what (\\"what to do, act or carry out\\"). According to Nikhil Sharma, Zeleny has argued for a tier to the model beyond wisdom, termed \\"enlightenment\\". Representations = Graphical representation = A flow diagram of the DIKW hierarchy. DIKW is a hierarchical model often depicted as a pyramid, with data at its base and wisdom at its apex. In this regard it is similar to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, in that each level of the hierarchy is argued to be an essential precursor to the levels above. Unlike Maslow's hierarchy, which describes relationships of priority (lower levels are focused on first), DIKW describes purported structural or functional relationships (lower levels comprise the material of higher levels). Both Zeleny and Ackoff have been credited with originating the pyramid representation, although neither used a pyramid to present their ideas. DIKW has also been represented as a two- dimensional chart or as one or more flow diagrams. In such cases, the relationships between the elements may be presented as less hierarchical, with feedback loops and control relationships. Debons and colleagues may have been the first to \\"present the hierarchy graphically\\". Throughout the years many adaptations of the DIKW pyramid have been produced. One example, in use by knowledge managers in the United States Army, attempts to show the progression transforming data to information then knowledge and finally wisdom, as well as the activities involved to ultimately create shared understanding throughout the organization and manage decision risk.US Army Techniques Publication (ATP) 6-01.1, Techniques for Effective Knowledge Management, published in March 2015 http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/atp6_01x1.pdf Adaptation of the DIKW pyramid by US Army Knowledge Managers = Computational representation = Intelligent decision support systems are trying to improve decision making by introducing new technologies and methods from the domain of modeling and simulation in general, and in particular from the domain of intelligent software agents in the contexts of agent-based modeling. Using advanced distributed simulation to support information, knowledge, and wisdom representation The following example describes a military decision support system, but the architecture and underlying conceptual idea are transferable to other application domains: * The value chain starts with data quality describing the information within the underlying command and control systems. * Information quality tracks the completeness, correctness, currency, consistency and precision of the data items and information statements available. * Knowledge quality deals with procedural knowledge and information embedded in the command and control system such as templates for adversary forces, assumptions about entities such as ranges and weapons, and doctrinal assumptions, often coded as rules. * Awareness quality measures the degree of using the information and knowledge embedded within the command and control system. Awareness is explicitly placed in the cognitive domain. By the introduction of a common operational picture, data are put into context, which leads to information instead of data. The next step, which is enabled by service-oriented web-based infrastructures (but not yet operationally used), is the use of models and simulations for decision support. Simulation systems are the prototype for procedural knowledge, which is the basis for knowledge quality. Finally, using intelligent software agents to continually observe the battle sphere, apply models and simulations to analyse what is going on, to monitor the execution of a plan, and to do all the tasks necessary to make the decision maker aware of what is going on, command and control systems could even support situational awareness, the level in the value chain traditionally limited to pure cognitive methods. Criticisms Rafael Capurro, a philosopher based in Germany, argues that data is an abstraction, information refers to \\"the act of communicating meaning\\", and knowledge \\"is the event of meaning selection of a (psychic/social) system from its 'world' on the basis of communication\\". As such, any impression of a logical hierarchy between these concepts \\"is a fairytale\\".Rafael Capurro, as cited in Zins, id., at p. 481 One objection offered by Zins is that, while knowledge may be an exclusively cognitive phenomenon, the difficulty in pointing to a given fact as being distinctively information or knowledge, but not both, makes the DIKW model unworkable. > [I]s Albert Einstein's famous equation \\"E = mc2\\" (which is printed on my > computer screen, and is definitely separated from any human mind) > information or knowledge? Is \\"2 + 2 = 4\\" information or knowledge? Alternatively, information and knowledge might be seen as synonyms.Poli, Roberto, as cited in Zins, id., at p. 485. In answer to these criticisms, Zins argues that, subjectivist and empiricist philosophy aside, \\"the three fundamental concepts of data, information, and knowledge and the relations among them, as they are perceived by leading scholars in the information science academic community\\", have meanings open to distinct definitions. Rowley echoes this point in arguing that, where definitions of knowledge may disagree, \\"[t]hese various perspectives all take as their point of departure the relationship between data, information and knowledge.\\" American philosophers John Dewey and Arthur Bentley, in their 1949 book Knowing and the Known, argued that \\"knowledge\\" was \\"a vague word\\", and presented a complex alternative to DIKW including some nineteen \\"terminological guide-posts\\". Information processing theory argues that the physical world is made of information itself. Under this definition, data is either made up of or synonymous with physical information. It is unclear, however, whether information as it is conceived in the DIKW model would be considered derivative from physical-information/data or synonymous with physical information. In the former case, the DIKW model is open to the fallacy of equivocation. In the latter, the data tier of the DIKW model is preempted by an assertion of neutral monism. Educator Martin Frické has published an article critiquing the DIKW hierarchy, in which he argues that the model is based on \\"dated and unsatisfactory philosophical positions of operationalism and inductivism\\", that information and knowledge are both weak knowledge, and that wisdom is the \\"possession and use of wide practical knowledge. David Weinberger argues that although the DIKW pyramid appears to be a logical and straight-forward progression, this is incorrect. \\"What looks like a logical progression is actually a desperate cry for help.\\" He points out there is a discontinuity between Data and Information (which are stored in computers), versus Knowledge and Wisdom (which are human endeavours). This suggests that the DIKW pyramid is too simplistic in representing how these concepts interact. \\"...Knowledge is not determined by information, for it is the knowing process that first decides which information is relevant, and how it is to be used.\\" See also  * * References  Further reading  * Category:Information science Category:Knowledge management Category:Information systems Category:Stage theories ","title":"DIKW pyramid"},{"id":"10755916","text":"Daraya (also Darayya, Daraiya, Darayia, ) is a village located in the Zgharta District in the North Governorate of Lebanon.

In 1876, Allison was appointed a Justice of the Peace and became the first Gold Commissioner of the newly created Similkameen Mining District. Allison died in 1897 and was buried at a site overlooking the Similkameen River near a landmark named \\"Castle Rock\\".

Each of his paintings is a meticulous, realistic study in flora and fauna, and is filled with symbols, clues, and jokes referencing texts ranging from colonial literature, to folktales, to travel guides. The paintings are complex allegorical narratives that critique the history of colonialism, industrialism, politics, natural science, and humanity's effect on the environment. Early life and career Ford recalled taking trips into the deep forest in Canada with his father as a child, exposing him to unspoiled wilderness. As a teenager, Ford became immersed in the underground cartoons of the 1960s, including ZAP and anything by Robert Crumb, who he considers “a major influence.” He attended the Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, Rhode Island, and in 1982 was granted a BFA degree in Filmmaking. He had his first major one-man show at the Brooklyn Museum in 2006 and is currently represented by the Paul Kasmin Gallery in Manhattan. In 2010, the retrospective \\"Walton Ford: Bestiarium\\" traveled from the Hamburger Bahnhof Museum Fur Gegenwart in Berlin to the Albertina in Vienna, finishing at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark in 2011. His work is included in the permanent collections of the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 2012, Ford designed the cover art for the Rolling Stones greatest hits album, GRRR!, which commemorated the band's 50th Anniversary. Ford is the recipient of several national awards and honors including a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts and is one of the artists profiled on the PBS series Art:21. Ford lives and works in New York City. Example works Dying Words, 2005, color etching, aquatint and drypoint on paper by Walton Ford, Honolulu Museum of Art Tur, a 2007 large-scale work in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, depicts the aurochs, a prehistoric bull that gave rise to modern day cattle. The Latin inscription at the top left of the painting reads: \\"The Polish call me tur, the Germans call me aurox, and the ignorant call me bison.\\" Another artwork in the same museum, Visitation, from 2004, depicts a large flock of passenger pigeons gorging themselves in a field strewn with fruit and nuts. The birds’ ravenous feasting on the bounty of the land can be seen to symbolize the exploitation of natural resources perpetrated by European settlers in the New World, which ultimately led to the extinction of their species. Dying Words from 2005 is a combination color etching, aquatint and drypoint on paper in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art. In this print, the extinct Carolina parakeet replaces people in Benjamin West's famous painting, The Death of General Wolfe.

It was established on 16 March 1913 in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, in a session held by the City Council. It was, at that time, the first corporation. The Cabildo of Tenerife, like the other councils of the Canary Islands, enjoys a number of local powers as contained in the Statute of Autonomy of the Canaries, other powers are delegated to the ministries of the territorial government.  Offices Insular Palace The initial location of the Tenerife Town Hall was the Santa Cruz de Tenerife City council building. In its first year the government transferred the offices to a building located at the intersection of the 25 de Julio Avenue and Numancia Street in the capital, Tinerfeña. A later transfer took the Town Hall support offices to Alfonso XII Street (currently Castillo Street), where they remained until 1928. In that year, due to the need to find a larger location to accommodate the office, there was a move to a new building located directly opposite the former, several floors rented. Although 100,000 pesetas was set aside to purchase a plot and blueprints were already developed in 1920, these plans did not materialize. After ten years the first steps were taken to acquire land in the area of the Marítima Avenue and provide the corporation with a settled home. Negotiations began with the Ministry of Development for authorization. Construction of the development project in that area of the city began in 1933 under the direction of engineer, José Luis Escario. The building was completed in late 1940 and the offices of the Santa Cruz de Tenerife were quickly filled. The new building, the Palacio Insular de Tenerife houses some departments of the Cabildo, but there are also other decentralized offices in different locations, and key offices elsewhere in the metropolitan area. The building is notable for its great tower decorated with a clock, commissioned in 1950, which chimes hourly, and is one of the more recognized symbols in the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Inside the building is an interesting collection of art, which includes murals that adorn the entire Salón Noble popularly called the \\"Sistine Chapel of the Canary Islands,\\" with paintings done in 1960 by the painter José Aguiar. In November 2011 these paintings were declared of cultural interest to the Canaries.  Internal organization  The Town Hall administration is made up of the following departments: * Presidency * Plenary Session * Government Council * Supervising Agencies * Plenary Session Commissions * Council of Spokesmen * Political Groups Departments The Island Council is composed of the following departments: * Presidency * Tourism and Planning * Health, Relations with the University of La Laguna * Sustainability, Territory and Environment * Administration and Treasury * Economy and Competitiveness * Social Welfare, Education, Equality and Sport * Roads, Municipal Co-operation and Housing * Human Resources and Legal Defence Area * Agriculture, Livestock, Fishing and Water * Mobility and Security * Culture, Heritage and Museums  Responsibilities and Authority  According to article 43 of the LRJAPC, the exclusive responsibilities of the town hall are: *The coordination of the municipal services of the island to guarantee its integral and suitable benefit to the entire insular territory, replacing the City Councils when the insufficiency of their resources prevents the provision of essential municipal services or established public functions in the LBRL. *The attendance to and legal, economic and technical cooperation with the municipalities, especially with those of smaller economic capacity and management. *The provision of supramunicipal public services. *The approval of plans by insular offices for the provision of works and services in collaboration with the City Councils of each island.

WHOM is owned by Townsquare Media and transmits from atop Mount Washington in New Hampshire, which is its community of license. Mount Washington is the tallest peak in the Northeast. WHOM's signal is among the strongest FM signals in the world, and the station can be heard in five states and one Canadian Province. Under proper weather conditions, the station's signal can reach as far East as Acadia National Park in Eastern Maine, as far north as Southern Quebec in Canada, as far south as Boston, Massachusetts and as far West as the Adirondack Mountains in New York. Although the station can be heard all over Northern New England, WHOM broadcasts from and considers itself part of the Portland, Maine radio market. WHOM claims on its website and on the air that it has the largest coverage area of any FM station in the United States. Sister station WPKQ also broadcasts from atop Mount Washington, but its signal is not as strong as WHOM's. WHOM promotes its programming as \\"safe for the whole family.\\" In addition to local DJs, the station also airs the syndicated John Tesh radio show. From late November to December 25, WHOM switches to an all-Christmas music format. History =Early years= WHOM traces its call letter history back to the mid-1920s: it was originally known as WIBS; at that time, it was licensed to Elizabeth, New Jersey and made its debut on June 29, 1925. Then, on April 12, 1930, WIBS officially became WHOM,\\"Last Night with the One Dialer.\\" (Jersey City) Jersey Journal, April 11, 1930, p. 28 operated by the New Jersey Broadcasting Company, with studios in Jersey City.\\"Larson on Air at Dinner to Hoffman.\\" (Hackensack NJ) The Record, March 31, 1930, p. 8. Among the personalities who broadcast on WHOM was African-American sportscaster Jocko Maxwell; by the time he joined the station in 1934, it had studios in Newark,\\"Jocko Maxwell Will Broadcast over WHOM.\\" Matawan (NJ) Journal, January 5, 1934, p. 6 and would later add a studio in New York. The station's format was a combination of educational programming, ethnic programming, sports, and some music. By 1940, the station was known for mainly its foreign language programming.\\"Advertisement for WHOM.\\" Broadcasting, May 11, 1942, p. 112. In 1944, WHOM was sold to the Iowa Broadcasting Company.\\"FCC Approves Sale of WHOM.\\" (Jersey City) Jersey Journal, July 26, 1944, p. 8. But the new parent company, better known as Cowles Broadcasting, did not own the station long. Arrangements were made to sell it to Generoso Pope, owner of the Italo- Americano Publishing Company, in late 1946.\\"Cowles-Pope Deal Seems Set Despite Immanent Fireworks.\\" Billboard, September 7, 1946, p. 5. Pope finalized the acquisition, and then operated the station with a combination of news, ethnic music, and educational programs, as before. Then, in the late 1940s, WHOM introduced a new popular music program;\\"Advertisement in Cashbox Magazine,\\" October 29, 1949, p. 15. it featured the city's only interracial deejay team, Willie Bryant and Ray Carroll.\\"A Salute to the Disk Jockeys.\\" (New York) Amsterdam News, August 25, 1951, p. 24. Their WHOM program lasted until 1954, at which time the general manager decided he wanted a change; Bryant believed it was due to a complaint from a sponsor.\\"Willie Bryant Fired from New York Radio Job.\\" Jet, May 6, 1954, p. 58. =WMTW-FM= The station that is today WHOM signed on the air July 9, 1958, as WMTW-FM. Along with Channel 8 WMTW-TV, which had signed on in 1954, WMTW-FM was owned by Mount Washington Television, an ownership group that included former Maine governor Horace Hildreth. The WMTW stations were sold to Jack Paar of Tonight Show fame in 1963. For most of its early years, WMTW-FM broadcast instrumental beautiful music. Jack Paar, in turn, sold WMTW-FM-TV to Mid New York Broadcasting in 1967. In 1971, WMTW-FM was sold to Alpine Broadcasting with Mid New York retaining WMTW-TV. As a result the radio station changed its call letters first to WWMT, then to WMTQ in 1973, and then finally to the current WHOM in 1976. That call sign previously was used by New York City radio stations 1480 AM (now WZRC) and 92.3 FM (now WNYL). The station offered an easy listening format consisting of instrumental versions of pop songs from artists like Henry Mancini, Ray Conniff, Percy Faith, Chet Atkins, and Herb Alpert, as well as several soft vocals per hour like The Carpenters, Dionne Warwick, Johnny Mathis, and Perry Como. This format continued through the 1980s. =WHOM= In January 1990, WHOM abruptly dropped the easy listening music for a soft adult contemporary format, dubbed \\"soft and easy favorites\\" by the station. It continued to market itself as an easy listening station and retained its air staff. In the mid 1990s, the station began adding softer songs by contemporary hit artists and began playing current product. By 2000, WHOM was more of a mainstream adult contemporary station. The station was sold to Fuller-Jeffrey Broadcasting by Barnstable Broadcasting in 1996. Fuller-Jeffrey then sold most of its stations, including WHOM, to Citadel Broadcasting in 1999.

In Riemannian geometry, it is a more general construction mapping a manifold to its Jacobi torus. The name derives from the theorem of Abel and Jacobi that two effective divisors are linearly equivalent if and only if they are indistinguishable under the Abel–Jacobi map. Construction of the map In complex algebraic geometry, the Jacobian of a curve C is constructed using path integration. Namely, suppose C has genus g, which means topologically that : H_1(C, \\\\Z) \\\\cong \\\\Z^{2g}. Geometrically, this homology group consists of (homology classes of) cycles in C, or in other words, closed loops. Therefore, we can choose 2g loops \\\\gamma_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\gamma_{2g} generating it. On the other hand, another more algebro-geometric way of saying that the genus of C is g is that : H^0(C, K) \\\\cong \\\\Complex^g, where K is the canonical bundle on C. By definition, this is the space of globally defined holomorphic differential forms on C, so we can choose g linearly independent forms \\\\omega_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\omega_g. Given forms and closed loops we can integrate, and we define 2g vectors : \\\\Omega_j = \\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\gamma_j} \\\\omega_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\int_{\\\\gamma_j} \\\\omega_g\\\\right) \\\\in \\\\Complex^g. It follows from the Riemann bilinear relations that the \\\\Omega_j generate a nondegenerate lattice \\\\Lambda (that is, they are a real basis for \\\\Complex^g \\\\cong \\\\R^{2g}), and the Jacobian is defined by :J(C) = \\\\Complex^g/\\\\Lambda. The Abel–Jacobi map is then defined as follows. We pick some base point p_0 \\\\in C and, nearly mimicking the definition of \\\\Lambda, define the map :\\\\begin{cases} u : C \\\\to J(C)  u(p) = \\\\left( \\\\int_{p_0}^p \\\\omega_1, \\\\dots, \\\\int_{p_0}^p \\\\omega_g\\\\right) \\\\bmod \\\\Lambda \\\\end{cases} Although this is seemingly dependent on a path from p_0 to p, any two such paths define a closed loop in C and, therefore, an element of H_1(C, \\\\Z), so integration over it gives an element of \\\\Lambda. Thus the difference is erased in the passage to the quotient by \\\\Lambda. Changing base-point p_0 does change the map, but only by a translation of the torus. The Abel–Jacobi map of a Riemannian manifold Let M be a smooth compact manifold. Let \\\\pi = \\\\pi_1(M) be its fundamental group. Let f: \\\\pi \\\\to \\\\pi^{ab} be its abelianisation map. Let \\\\operatorname{tor}= \\\\operatorname{tor}(\\\\pi^{ab}) be the torsion subgroup of \\\\pi^{ab}. Let g: \\\\pi^{ab} \\\\to \\\\pi^{ab}/\\\\operatorname{tor} be the quotient by torsion. If M is a surface, \\\\pi^{ab}/\\\\operatorname{tor} is non-canonically isomorphic to \\\\Z^{2g}, where g is the genus; more generally, \\\\pi^{ab}/\\\\operatorname{tor} is non-canonically isomorphic to \\\\Z^b , where b is the first Betti number. Let \\\\varphi=g \\\\circ f : \\\\pi \\\\to \\\\Z^b be the composite homomorphism. Definition. The cover \\\\bar M of the manifold M corresponding to the subgroup \\\\ker(\\\\varphi) \\\\subset \\\\pi is called the universal (or maximal) free abelian cover. Now assume M has a Riemannian metric. Let E be the space of harmonic 1-forms on M, with dual E^* canonically identified with H_1(M,\\\\R). By integrating an integral harmonic 1-form along paths from a basepoint x_0\\\\in M, we obtain a map to the circle \\\\R/\\\\Z=S^1. Similarly, in order to define a map M\\\\to H_1(M,\\\\R) / H_1(M,\\\\Z)_{\\\\R} without choosing a basis for cohomology, we argue as follows. Let x be a point in the universal cover \\\\tilde{M} of M. Thus x is represented by a point of M together with a path c from x_0 to it. By integrating along the path c, we obtain a linear form on E: :h\\\\to \\\\int_c h. This gives rise a map :\\\\tilde{M}\\\\to E^* = H_1(M,\\\\R), which, furthermore, descends to a map :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\overline{A}_M: \\\\overline{M}\\\\to E^*  c\\\\mapsto \\\\left( h\\\\mapsto \\\\int_c h \\\\right) \\\\end{cases} where \\\\overline{M} is the universal free abelian cover. Definition. The Jacobi variety (Jacobi torus) of M is the torus :J_1(M)=H_1(M,\\\\R)/H_1(M,\\\\Z)_{\\\\R}. Definition. The Abel–Jacobi map :A_M: M \\\\to J_1(M), is obtained from the map above by passing to quotients. The Abel–Jacobi map is unique up to translations of the Jacobi torus. The map has applications in Systolic geometry. The Abel–Jacobi map of a Riemannian manifold shows up in the large time asymptotics of the heat kernel on a periodic manifold ( and ). In much the same way, one can define a graph- theoretic analogue of Abel–Jacobi map as a piecewise-linear map from a finite graph into a flat torus (or a Cayley graph associated with a finite abelian group), which is closely related to asymptotic behaviors of random walks on crystal lattices, and can be used for design of crystal structures. Abel–Jacobi theorem The following theorem was proved by Abel: Suppose that :D = \\\\sum olimits_i n_i p_i is a divisor (meaning a formal integer-linear combination of points of C). We can define :u(D) = \\\\sum olimits_i n_i u(p_i) and therefore speak of the value of the Abel–Jacobi map on divisors. The theorem is then that if D and E are two effective divisors, meaning that the n_i are all positive integers, then :u(D) = u(E) if and only if D is linearly equivalent to E. This implies that the Abel-Jacobi map induces an injective map (of abelian groups) from the space of divisor classes of degree zero to the Jacobian. Jacobi proved that this map is also surjective, so the two groups are naturally isomorphic. The Abel–Jacobi theorem implies that the Albanese variety of a compact complex curve (dual of holomorphic 1-forms modulo periods) is isomorphic to its Jacobian variety (divisors of degree 0 modulo equivalence). For higher-dimensional compact projective varieties the Albanese variety and the Picard variety are dual but need not be isomorphic.

The Syrian Christian community was always a small community with only 70 Syrian Christians recorded in the census of 1930. Among the earliest was Isaac Benjamin (also known as the \\"Ninan Inspector\\") who was followed by K.C. George in 1911. K.C. George laid the foundation of the Mar Thoma Church in Malaya by actively encouraging the movement of Syrian Christians from Kerala to Malaya, in spite of the dangers posed by malaria, rampant this country at that time.Mathews, Philip: \\"The Mar Thoma Church: A Malaysian Perspective\\", pp 45, 1986 Early Mar Thoma services generally took the form of prayer meetings in private homes. The first service following the Mar Thoma Service Order was held on the first Sundays of every month in the Jubilee School in Klang. This was followed in 1929 by regular services in the Penuel High School in Kuala Lumpur led by K. G. Mathew.Mathews, Philip: \\"The Mar Thoma Church: A Malaysian Perspective\\", pp 46, 1986 =The first clergy arrives= In 1928, the Very Rev. V.P. Mammen (later Vicar General V. P.

Mammen (Kattanathachen), 1876- 1952 (URL last accessed on 19 April 2007) the General Secretary of the Sunday School Samajam, visited Malaya and upon his return to India strongly recommended to the Sabha Council that a Syrian Christian priest be sent there,to meet the desire of Marthomites to hold formal worship services in Malayalam. In 1932, Mar Thoma members in Klang, Kuala Lumpur, Banting and Kuala Selangor passed a resolution to request a priest from India, who would be resident in Malaya for a few years. The call was answered when the Rev. T.N. Koshy arrived from India in August 1936. Rev. T.N. Koshy travelled the length and breadth of Malaya and Singapore to minister to the spiritual needs of the Syrian Christian community who were already here and those who were still coming to Malaya. This led to the setting up of one single parish covering the whole of Malaya and Singapore and laid the foundations of another era in the history of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church marking the establishment of the first Mar Thoma parish outside of India.St. Thomas' Church, Klang - History: Mar Thoma Syrian Church in Malaysia (URL last accessed on 19 April 2007) =War and peace= While there were those who doubted the viability of creating a parish out of this scattered community, they had not reckoned on the steady growth of the population. While most Syrian Christians still thought of Malaya as a temporary sojourn, there were signs of increasing commitment to this country; one of the most important was the purchase of a piece of land in Kuala Lumpur, on which to construct a church. What was significant was that this purchase was made right at the height of the Japanese Occupation.Mar Thoma Syrian Church in Malaysia: About Us (URL last accessed on 19 April 2007) With the conclusion of the war, a spurt in migrations of Syrian Christians was seen as further opportunities in the plantation, civil/administrative services and educational sectors opened up. The Rev. V.E. Thomas (later Senior Vicar for Malaysia-Singapore); who was here during the war years; received ordination in 1947 in India and returned to assist to meet the need of the increasing membership. In September/October 1953, the first three church buildings of the Mar Thoma community in Malaya; all named after St. Thomas; (in Kuala Lumpur, Klang and Singapore) were consecrated by the Rt. Rev. Dr. Mathews Mar Athanasius during the first ever Episcopal visit to the fledgling Mar Thoma Church in Malaya and Singapore. In 1958, the Rev. T.N. Koshy was elevated as the Vicar-General for Malaya in recognition of the valuable services he rendered in encouraging and fostering the growth of the church in Malaya. =Elevation as diocese= With the independence of Malaya in 1957, the number of parishes grew steadily and in 1962, the Diocese of Malaysia and Singapore was constituted comprising 27 parishes. Although the community suffered from emigration, especially after the May 13 Incident of 1969, activity continued apace indicating the further indigenisation of the Mar Thoma Church in Malaysia. In 1982, the parishes in Malaysia and Singapore were constituted as the \\"Malaysian Zone and the Singapore Zone of the Diocese of Malaysia and Singapore respectively (now the Diocese of Malaysia, Singapore and Australia). Organisation and Symbols =The Zonal Assembly= The church convenes a Zonal Assembly annually as the highest decision making body of the church and it consists of elected representatives of the various parishes and organisations. Zonal assembly members are elected for a 3-year period. The Zonal council consisting of all the vicars, the zonal secretary, the zonal treasurer and three council members function as the decision making and operational arm of the church. =Logo of the Mar Thoma Church= The logo of the Mar Thoma Church consists of a shield emblazoned with a Christian cross with the representation of the Ashoka Chakra at its centre. It is flanked on the right and left by a lotus and a hand lamp respectively. The motto; Lighted To Lighten; is written in English above the cross.Mar Thoma Diocese of North America & Europe: The Logo (URL last accessed 19 April 2007) * The Motto :The role of the church is to spread the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Every believer and member of the Church here in their position, wherever they are, are given the light so that they can lighten others. * The Cross :The cross placed in the centre represents the centrality of Jesus Christ in the church and its mission. It is a proclamation that God (Purusha) himself came and atoned for all mankind and the redemption is freely available by faith in Jesus Christ without regard to any form of karma. * The Ashoka Chakra :The Ashoka Chakra is the symbol of India and represents the Indian roots of the church. Traditionally the Chakra as presented by the Emperor Ashoka, was a symbol in denoting the Wheel of Life and Cosmic Order (or Dharmachakra). By placing the wheel at the heart of the Cross, it is a declaration that life finds its ultimate salvation in the atoning sacrifice of Jesus once and for all. It symbolises the completion and closing of the wheel of life for all those who follow the Bhakthi Marga (path of righteousness) in Jesu Maseeh (Jesus Christ). * The Hand Lamp :The hand lamp represents the lamp that is carried in all believers. It reminds all believers to be the light of the world and act as a witness to give the light of salvation for others in their daily life. It also seeks to remind to pay diligent attention to the study of the word of God. * The Lotus :The lotus represents holy living and is traditionally part of the offering of sacrifices of praise and adoration in the Indian tradition to God. It reminds believers to live holy despite the circumstances around them and exude the fragrance of God.

It was conceived and built by artist Mark Cline as a roadside attraction, and opened on April 1, 2004. Foamhenge was relocated to Centreville, Virginia in 2017.  Design and construction  Foamhenge was created in 2004 by Mark Cline of Enchanted Castle Studios as an April Fool's Day stunt to generate tourism. The idea for Foamhenge came to Mark in 1998, when he was inspired by foam blocks that he saw at a local insulation manufacturer. Mark had the concept and materials, but needed a location for his creation. In 2004, he made an agreement with The Natural Bridge for rent- free land with the intention of attracting tourists to both sites. Foamhenge is designed to match Stonehenge, with similarly sized pieces oriented in astronomically equivalent coordinates. The 'stones' are composed completely of styrofoam and painted gray, weighing approximately 420 lbs. apiece. They are stabilized with embedded piping, extending from a concrete footing to the top of each stone. The entire structure was assembled in about ten days, as opposed to Stonehenge's construction period of about 1000 years.  Popularity and move to northern Virginia  Foamhenge was created as a whimsical, temporary, passive roadside attraction and architectural folly, but its popularity sustained its legitimacy and purpose. Foamhenge lasted at the Natural Bridge site for over 12 years, well beyond Cline's expectations of 'a year or two.' By 2015, the foam pieces had deteriorated markedly due to the temporary nature of its construction and overexposure to the elements in a moderate climate. Many of the pieces had fallen into disrepair to the point that they had split apart and held together with temporary supports. The Natural Bridge became a state park in 2016, forcing Foamhenge to close. The structure was dismantled on August 30, 2016 and placed in storage at Cline's studio. After receiving over fifty inquiries from across the United States, an agreement was made to relocate Foamhenge to Cox Farms, a popular family farm, near Centreville, VA, a suburb of Washington, D.C. After the pieces were repaired and repainted, they were moved and re-constructed, with help from an astronomer, for permanent display at Cox Farms. Foamhenge re-opened in time for the start of the farm's \\"Fall Festival' on September 16, 2017.

After the battle, on his way back to Kabul, he left it at Lahore with his governor, Khawaja Ubed, as the carriage that was supposed to take the gun to Kabul was not ready. The other gun he took with him but that one was lost in passage through the Chenab. In 1762, Dhillon Jat Ruler Maharaja Hari Singh Bhangi went into battle with Khawaja Ubed. Bhangi attacked the then-village of Khawaja Said two miles from Lahore (now part of the city of Lahore), where the Mughal governor Khawaja Ubed had his arsenal, and seized his artillery, arms and ammunition. Amongst the guns captured was the Zamzama Gun itself. It was renamed by its Sikh captors Bhangi Toap. For the next two years, it lay in the Shah Burj of the Lahore Fort. Thereafter, Raja Lehna Singh and Maharaja Gujjar Singh Bhangi got hold of it and they gave it to Sandhawalia Jat Ruler Charat Singh Shukerchakia as his share in the spoils. The Bhangi Sardars thought that Charat Singh would not be able to carry this gun with him and it would remain with them. Contrary to their expectations, Charat Singh successfully carried this gun to his fort at Gujranwala. From Charat Singh, Zamzama was snatched by the Chathas who took it to Ahmadnagar where it became a bone of contention between the brothers Ahmad Khan chatha and Pir Muhammad chatha. In the fight that ensued, two sons of Ahmad Khan and one of Pir Muhammad were killed. In this fight, Gujjar Singh Bhangi sided with Pir Muhammad. After the victory, the gun was restored to Gujjar Singh. After two years, the gun was wrested by Charat Singh Shukerchakia from whom it was once again snatched by the Pashtuns. Next year, Raja Jhanda Singh Bhangi defeated the Pashtuns of Chatha and brought the gun to Amritsar. In 1802, Ranjit Singh, after defeating the Bhangis, got hold of the gun. He used it in the battles of Daska, Kasur, Sujanpur, Wazirabad and Multan. In the siege of Multan, the gun was badly damaged.The legendary Zamzama By Subhash Parihar  Decommissioning  thumb300px\\"He sat in defiance of municipal orders, astride the gun Zam- Zammeh, on her old platform, opposite the old Ajaibgher, the Wonder House, as the natives called the Lahore Museum.

It was placed outside Delhi Gate, Lahore, where it remained until 1860. When in 1864, Maulawi Nur Ahmad Chishti compiled the TahqiqatiChishti, he found it standing in the Baradari of the garden of Wazir Khan, behind the Lahore Museum. In 1870, it found a new asylum at the entrance of the Lahore Museum, then located in the Tollinton Market. It was placed in this position on the occasion of the Duke of Edinburgh’s visit to Lahore in 1870. When the present building of the museum was constructed it was removed further west and placed opposite the University Hall. Repaired in 1977, the cannon now rests on Mall Road (Shahrah-e-Quaid-e-Azam) with Pharmacy Department, University of the Punjab on one side, and National College of Arts (NCA) and Lahore Museum on the other.  Other names  It came to be known as Kim's Gun after Rudyard Kipling in whose childhood memoirs it is frequently mentioned. The novel Kim opens with the protagonist straddling the gun. It was also called Bhangianwali Toap, because it was used by the Sikh chief Sardar Akali Phula Singh Bhangi. Maharaja Ranjit Singh requested Sadhu Singh Bhangi follower of Akali Phula Singh in 1802 and took the gun into his possession.[sic] Maharaja Ranjit Singh actually defeated Chet Singh Bhangi, son of Lehna Singh Bhangi (who had previously ruled over Lahore for more than 30 years as part of the 3 sardars of the Bhangi Misl).

LDS Mission Following his freshman year at BYU, Herring served an LDS Church mission in Salta, Argentina from 1988 to 1990. While he was there he read about Erroll Bennett, a professional soccer player in Tahiti, who withdrew from his team after joining the LDS Church and deciding not to play on the Sabbath. Herring was impressed by Bennett's commitment and dedication to what he viewed was right. Herring's views on money were also affected by his time in Argentina. When he arrived there one U.S. dollar was worth 15 Argentine australs, but by the time he left, a dollar was worth about 10,000 australs. This period of hyper-inflation helped him realize he could not trust in money nor make decisions solely based on money.Joseph Richardson, \\"To Keep It Holy\\", New Era, October 1997.

Herring rejected it.

Biography Born in Friedland, Bohemia, then part of Austria- Hungary, Richter was the son weaver and farmer at Mildenau. At the age of 16 he emigrated to Galveston, Texas, and after a misadventure where he was wounded and captured by Indians, following the lure of the gold rushes westward, he came to Rich Bar, Washington and with the take from his placer claim opened a small store and operated a small riverboat. Hearing of good grazing land northwards in British Columbia, he sold out his mine holdings in Washington and bought 42 head of cattle with a man by the name of King, and they drove them to the Cawston area south of the Keremeos, which is located in the Similkameen Valley of British Columbia's Southern Interior in October 1864. He pre-empted land six miles (10 km) down the Similkameen Valley from Keremeos and founded the \\"R\\" Ranch. He also worked for a while for the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Similkameen (Fort Keremeos). With his cattle business thriving he sold the \\"R\\" ranch and started a new ranch on what is now known as the Richter Pass. In 1898 he purchased another property at Keremeos Centre, where he also operated a thriving store. In addition to an opulent new residence, Richter planted of fruit trees on the new property, which was to become the foundation of the Similkameen's still-thriving orchard industry and, alongside the Oblate priests of Okanagan Mission, is reckoned to be the founder of BC's fruit industry. The house and the Richter household became social pillars of British Columbia society and important guests were common at the Richter ranch. Among those hosted by Richter was Earl Grey in 1908. Eventually the Richter holdings comprised 10,000 acres (40 km²) of land and 1,500 head of cattle. FX Richter's relationship with Lucy Simla (Sʔímlaʔxʷ) (1846-1903) was a 'marriage of the land'. She was a member of the Okanagan First Nation in Vernon BC.Louis, Shirley 2008. Q'sapi: a history of Okanagan people as told by Okanagan families. Lucy Simla and Franz Xavier Richter had 5 sons together: Charles 1869-1949, William 1872-1922, Joseph 1874-1971, Edward 1876-1966, Hans 1877-1961. For schooling the boys had to ride on horseback to Okanagan Mission, known as Father Pandosy's Mission, and board there while attending. Richter married Florence Elizabeth Loudon in 1894 prior to the death of his first partner Lucy Simla. In 1910, Richter was to return to his native Austria but fell ill at a Christmas Dinner at St. Joseph's Hospital in Victoria and died within moments, of \\"a stroke of apoplexy\\". He is buried in the Keremeos cemetery. Richter had six sons and five daughters. Richter's youngest son, Frank Richter, Jr., was a Member of the Legislative Assembly and Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Mines in the Social Credit government of W.A.C. Bennett, representing the Similkameen riding from 1953 to 1966 and its successor riding Boundary-Similkameen from 1966 to 1975. Legacy Richter Pass, Richter Mountain, Richter Creek and Richter Lake, all in the small mountain range at the southeast end of the Thompson Plateau between the lower Similkameen and South Okanagan, are named for him. The Richter Ranch in the same area continues in operation to this day.

They were introduced in the course of the 1980s. The locomotives are nicknamed Tigre (\\"tiger\\"). History The E.632/E.633 were the first Italian locomotives to be provided with electronic traction control system, on the basis of the experiments made with the E.444.005 test locomotive. They were designed to fulfill a requirement from the Ferrovie dello Stato (or FS, then the quasi-monopolist of Italian railways) for a new locomotive to be used with medium-weight passenger trains and a similar one for cargo services on steep lines. The first unit ran on October 11, 1979. After a troublesome program of tests with the first five prototypes, a first order for 90 engines (75 E.633, the cargo version, and 15 E.632) was issued. Regular services began in 1983 in northern Italy. Once the teething problems were solved, the class proved highly successful and reliable. Technical details Differently from many of the previous FS classes, the E.632/633 carbody is not articulated. The power plant is made of three FS T850 DC motors, mounted on monomotor bogies, each with two axles. Each motor is provided with a three-frequency chopper which takes place of the resistor network used on older Italian locomotives (rheostat). This allow the motors to run for an indefinite period of time without risks. The two classes have different transmission gear: 36/64 for the E.632, with a maximum speed of , and 29/64, with a maximum speed of only but a higher tractive effort. Since the beginning, all units were provided with the standard 78-wire cable for coupling with driving passenger cars, useful in the formation of commuter push-pull trains. 40 E633s were also fitted with a 13-wire ZDS cable (') in order to allow hauling with multiple units by only one engine crew, from the \\"master\\" locomotive. The locomotives have, in addition to pneumatic brakes, a rheostatic braking system. The braking rheostat is placed on the roof, between the pantographs. The air brake employs a mixed shoes-disc system (one shoe per wheel and one disc per axle), due to space issues about the motor placement; also, E.632 have brake cylinders, while E.633 . The chopper regulation and the rheostatic braking allow the driver to set an automatic speed control; the locomotive will try to keep the set speed by electrically braking or by tractioning if needed. This group has been the first in Italy that allowed this. Related development The E.632/633 was used as base for the development of the E.491/492 locomotives for use with 25 kV AC lines in Sardinia, which however were never mass built. Class E.652 is a type of locomotive derived from E.633/2. They unite the acceleration and hauling capacities of E.633 with the speed of E.632 (); externally they are almost identical to E.632/3, but the electrical part is very different. The first unit was built in 1989, and have been the first Italian locomotive with electronic board diagnostics and relative screen on the driver's desk. , 171 E.652s are assigned to the Global Logistic (Cargo) division of Trenitalia, hauling freight trains, though sometimes can be seen hauling passenger trains (often long-range ones) on rescue services due to failures. The B-B locomotive E.620 of Ferrovie Nord Milano (nicknamed Tigrotto) is a two-bogie version of the class.

Population: The district extends due north from Kitai-gorod to Kamer- Kollezhsky Val. Western boundary with Tverskoy District follows the track of Neglinnaya River (Neglinnaya Street, Tsvetnoy Boulevard, Samotechnaya Street, Soviet Army Street). Eastern boundary with Krasnoselsky District follows Bolshaya Lubyanka Street and Sretenka Street, then one block east from Mira Avenue. The Lubyanka Building lies in the Meshchansky District. The district contains part of Kuznetsky Most Street, Rozhdestvensky monastery and Rozhdestvensky Boulevard, Olympic Stadium and a row of neoclassical, palace- like buildings north from the Garden Ring. It houses headquarters of Federal Security Service in Lubyanka Square, Central Bank of the Russian Federation, FAPSI and other government agencies. Etymology Meshchane in the Russian Empire denoted a social estate of poor town residents who did not qualify as merchants or civil servants; in modern Russian, it is a pejorative name for a narrow-minded philistine. Meschansky District acquired its name earlier, in the second half of 17th century, through the Ukrainians and Belarusians abducted from their hometowns in the course of Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). These people settled north from present-day Garden Ring, reaching 692 households by 1682 (Sytin, p. 296).

Employing stoichiometric models of metabolism and mass spectrometry methods with isotopic mass resolution, the transfer of moieties containing isotopic tracers from one metabolite into another can be elucidated, and information about the metabolic network thus derived. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) has many applications such as determining the limits on the ability of a biological system in producing a biochemical such as ethanol and predicting the response to gene additions or knockouts.

The non-populated area is used for agriculture. There are barely any woods.  History  After the Ottoman wars, the strongly decimated population was supplemented by the influx of Croatian-speaking population. The Burgenland Croats have shrunk noticeably in recent decades, but are still very active in community life. The majority of church services are held mainly in the Croatian language. The town belonged to Hungary (German-Western Hungary) until the foundation of Burgenland in 1920/21. Before the Second World War, Jewish families lived in Pama, as well as in Kittsee, the neighboring town that was part of the seven Jewish communities in Burgenland.

In total, 17% of the population of the Solomon Islands adheres to the church, making it the third most common religious affiliation in the country behind the Anglican Church of Melanesia and the Roman Catholic Church. The SSEC is particularly popular on Malaita, the most populous island, where 47% of its members live; there are also smaller populations in Honiara and elsewhere on Guadalcanal, on Makira, and in other provinces. History The organisation was founded in 1886 as the \\"Queensland Kanaka Mission\\" (QKM) in Queensland, Australia, as an evangelical and non-denominational church targeting Kanakas (blackbirded labourers at the sugarcane plantations, mostly from the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). Florence Young, the sister of Arthur, Horace and Ernest Young, the owners of the Fairymead plantation on which the mission was located, was largely responsible for the establishment of the mission, and served as secretary of the organisation. At its height in 1904–05, it employed 19 missionaries, 118 unpaid \\"native teachers,\\" and celebrated 2150 conversions. Young used pidgin English and illustrations to explain the resurrection and other Christian ideas. The South Seas Evangelical Mission (SSEM) was established in 1904 by Young as a branch of the Queensland Kanaka Mission. Its purpose was to follow the workers back to their homeland, and maintain their religious instruction there. At that time fewer workers were coming, due to the White Australia policy. Florence Young continued to administer the organisation, from Sydney and Katoomba, and made annual trips to the island until 1926. Between 1906 and 1920, the SSEM established small enclaves on the coast of islands. On Malaita, these enclaves were always under threat from the more powerful bush groups. The first missionary in the Kwaio territory, for instance, was killed, ostensibly to purify a curse, but more because of the perceived threat to their power.Roger M. Keesing. Kwaio Religion. New York: Columbia University Press, 1982. Pages 22–23. Under pressure from the administration of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, the Mission re-evaluated its language policy, and in the 1920s began to use English as a medium of instruction, instead of pidgins or local languages; however, to facilitate understanding, they devised a simplified English. The SSEM was criticised for using its religious influence to support the Malayta Company, which was led by the Young family in Queensland, and maintained close connections with the mission.Roger M. Keesing and Peter Corris. Lightning Meets the West Wind: The Malaita Massacre. Melbourne:Oxford UP, 1980. p. 73. After World War II, the experience of many Solomon Islanders that not all whites are strict Christians made some upset that the SSEM withheld what they saw as the real key to power, education beyond literacy. Some whites were then ejected from churches as Malaita Bible teachers participated in the Maasina Rule movement.Keesing, 235. The South Seas Evangelical Church was established in 1964 under its current name, and became independent from the mission in 1975. Beliefs and practices The SSEC is strict with regard to behaviour of its members, who are not permitted to drink alcohol, chew betel nuts or smoke. Both men and women are active in all aspects of the church's activities. The SSEC discourages performance of traditional forms of music, such as 'Are'are panpipe ensembles, because they are peter as related to the traditional ancestor worship, the spirits of which are considered \\"devils.\\"Zemp, Hugo. Liner notes to Solomon Islands: 'Are'are Panpipe Ensembles. Le Chant du Monde LDX 274961.62, 1994. p. 59. In the Solomon Islands there are a number of schools sponsored by the SSEC, which, like other religious schools in the Solomon Islands, receive subsidies from the government. In their missionary work, they have used a few Europeans, but they primarily train natives as Bible teachers, and arrange to have them teach their home community.Keesing, 233. The SSEM publishes the work Not in Vain (originally, in the days of the QKM, Not in Vain: What God hath wrought amongst the Kanakas in Queensland), which includes annual reports, financial statements, and SSEM Letters.

Dr. John M. Mason of New York visited the Burgher Synod of Scotland on a recruiting trip as commissioner of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Synod of North America. Career =Immigration to the United States and ministry= In March 1803 Bishop accepted a call from the Ebenezer Church in Jessamine County, Kentucky. While serving as minister at Ebenezer, he was offered a professorship in history at Transylvania University in Lexington, which he accepted. Bishop served as acting president of Transylvania University from 1816 to 1818. James G. Birney was his student at Transylvania. He was an early sympathizer with the plight of black slaves. In 1815, he organized a Negro school at Pisgah in Woodford County, Kentucky, and in 1816 he opened a school for African-American girls at Transylvania. His 1824 history of the church in Kentucky gave credit to the slaves Peter Durrett and his wife for founding and building up the First African Baptist Church of Lexington, Kentucky.Robert Hamilton Bishop's An Outline of the history of the church in the state of Kentucky, during a period of forty years (containing the memoir of Rev. David Rice), T.T. Skillman, 1824, pp. 230-233 Late- nineteenth century histories noted only white churches in Kentucky. Rev. Bishop next became a supply preacher at the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington from 1820 to 1823. He also served as a minister in Versailles, Kentucky. First president of Miami University Bishop was selected as the first President of Miami University, founded in Oxford, Ohio, which opened for classes in 1824. He served from 1824 to 1841, when he resigned the presidency. He continued to hold the professorship of history and political science until the Autumn of 1844. In 1845 he became headmaster of Farmer's College in College Hill, Ohio. He died in 1855 and was buried on the grounds of Farmer's College in a mound of earth which came to be known as the \\"Bishop Mound\\". More than 100 years later, Bishop's remains were re-interred at Miami University. Legacy and honors *In 1830, the Erodelphian Literary Society at Miami University commissioned Hiram Powers to sculpt a bust of Bishop. *Bishop Hall, the honors dormitory on the Miami campus, was named in his honor. *The Bishop Medal, Miami University's highest alumni award, was established in his honor. Two of Bishop's most famous students were Jefferson Davis at Transylvania and Benjamin Harrison at Farmer's College. He recruited for the Miami faculty, William Holmes McGuffey and John Witherspoon Scott, father-in-law of Benjamin Harrison. Scott spoke at Bishop's funeral saying, in part, \\"during the changes and controversies originating in skeptical views among those controlling that (Miami) university, there was always one who nobly stood by the faithful Christian soldier, Dr. Bishop, and that was the national statesman, Henry Clay. He continued to implore the directors to retain Dr. Bishop,for, if they did not have one praying man in the university it surely would go down.\\" Books Dr. Bishop was a prolific writer.

The other is the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska. Traditionally, peoples of both tribes have spoken the Omaha-Ponca language, part of the Siouan language family. Under the Department of Interior's Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations, more than 1300 holders of fractional interests at this tribe were offered a total of $7 million to purchase holdings for transfer to the tribe, to increase their communal lands. Government The Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma is headquartered in Ponca City, Oklahoma. Their tribal jurisdictional area includes parts of Kay and Noble counties. Of the 3,787 enrolled tribal members, 3000 live within the state of Oklahoma. Membership in the tribe requires a 1/8 minimum blood quantum, according to rules developed by the tribe. =Current administration= According to their written constitution, the seven-member governing council of the Ponca Tribe, called the Business Committee, is democratically elected for four-year terms.

Their tribal jurisdiction is relatively isolated and they have worked to create jobs for their people. They developed a casino in Ponca City, their major jurisdiction. It is more than 105 miles north of Oklahoma City by car, and about 94 miles northwest of Tulsa, two major population centers. The Blue Star Gaming and Casino has ceased operations.Oklahoma Indian Casinos: Casinos by Tribe.500 Nations. Retrieved 2 Jan 2011. The Ponca opened a second casino in the same location, called the Two Rivers Casino; it also went out of business in the economic downturn due to the national recession in 2008-2009. The tribe was severely affected by this. The estimated annual economic impact of the Ponca Tribe in 2011 was $1,964,321, down from $15 million in 2008, when the casino was operating. Language and culture In 2009 an estimated 33 tribal members spoke the Ponca language.Anderton, Alice, PhD. Status of Indian Languages in Oklahoma.

(retrieved 15 Oct 2011) The Ponca tribe separated from the Omaha tribe in the early 18th century as they were migrating west from the Great Lakes region. They settled in present-day Nebraska and South Dakota. Smallpox and other introduced Eurasian diseases took a heavy toll of the tribe repeatedly in the 18th and 19th centuries, as they had no immunity to the new diseases. The more powerful Sioux, also known as the Lakota, encroached on their land base. The Ponca never went to war with the United States. They signed their first peace treaty with the US in 1817. In the 1825 they signed a trade agreement. Treaties in 1858 and 1865 ceded lands. The 1860s and 1870s were a difficult time for the Ponca tribe, as the buffalo were disappearing, droughts destroyed crops, and warfare with the Sioux combined to threaten the Ponca with starvation. The US did not uphold their treaty obligations to the Ponca. They gave land reserved for the Ponca to the Sioux in 1868, as part of the Great Sioux Reservation. The government relocated the Ponca to Indian Territory in 1877.Van de Logt, Mark. \\"Ponca\\" , Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture. 2009 (6 August 2009) The forced removal of the Ponca to Indian Territory was mismanaged; they arrived too late to plant crops, the government failed to provide them with adequate supplies, and their assigned location had chronic malaria. An estimated 158 Ponca died during the first year: almost a third of the entire tribe. Among them was the oldest son of Standing Bear, a Ponca chief. Standing Bear took his son's body back to Nebraska for burial in traditional lands. There he was arrested by the Army for having left the reservation, but he gained the sympathy of Brigadier General George Crook. With help from prominent attorneys working pro bono, Standing Bear filed a habeas corpus suit challenging his arrest. The US District Court judge's decision in Standing Bear v. Crook (1879) established the right of Indian people to exercise habeas corpus and their legal status as citizens under US law. White Eagle, a principal Ponca chief, settled on a reservation in what would later be organized as Kay and Noble counties in Oklahoma. He leased much of the land to the 101 Ranch for pasture (and later, oil development). In the 1890s missionaries and government agents tried to make the Ponca abandon their traditional tribal dances and lifeways. In 1892, under the Dawes Allotment Act, the US government registered the members of the tribe, and allocated individual plots of land to each household. This was intended to introduce them to fee ownership and subsistence farming, as well as extinguish Indian tribal land claims in Oklahoma prior to its becoming a state. The government declared the remaining reservation land as \\"surplus\\" and sold it to European-American settlers, who were able to use it productivly. =20th century to present= The discovery of oil on Ponca lands in 1911 had mixed results for the people. Some became wealthy but others were taken advantage of by speculators and quickly lost their land. Drilling and exploitation of oil, together with mining of other resources, created environmental problems for the tribe. Peyote religion was introduced in the 1910s. In 1918, Louis MacDonald and Frank Eagle, both Ponca, co-founded the Native American Church. After many Ponca served in World War I, returning Ponca veterans founded the American Legion chapter Buffalo Post 38. In their community they revived traditional war dances, such as the heluska dance. Under the 1936 Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act, the tribe reorganized their government. They ratified their constitution in 1950 and became federally recognized. Tribal headquarters were established in White Eagle, located south of Ponca City. Clyde Warrior, a Ponca, cofounded the National Indian Youth Council. He promoted self-determination and inspired many young Native activists during the 1960s and 1970s. In the years since allocation of plots under the Dawes Act, these landholdings and interests became highly fractionated among heirs, often preventing effective use of the land and making sales difficult. In addition, the departments of Interior and Treasury were found in the late 20th century to have mismanaged the fee accounts and payments due to holders of fractionated land for drilling and mineral leases. In 2009 the US government settled a major class action suit against it brought by Elouise Cobell (Blackfeet) in 1996, known as the Cobell v. Salazar suit. The Ponca are participating in the Department of Interior's Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations, developed as part of this settlement. In August 2016, Interior officials announced that it had offered approximately $7 million in purchase offers to \\"more than 1,300 landowners with fractional interests at the Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma\\" as part of the Land Buy- Back Program for Tribal Nations (Buy-Back Program). Recipients have 45 days to complete the transaction. This program is designed to purchase fractionated interests and transfer land back to tribes in trust, to increase their communal holdings and ability to better use the land.\\"More than $7 Million in Buy-Back Offers Sent to Landowners with Fractional Interests at Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma\\", Press Release, 18 August 2016, Department of Interior; accessed 26 November 2016 Notes External links * Ponca Tribe of Oklahoma, official website * Constitution of the Ponca Tribe of Indians * \\"Ponca\\", Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture Category:Dhegiha Siouan peoples Category:Native American tribes in Oklahoma Category:Federally recognized tribes in the United States Category:Plains tribes ","title":"Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma"},{"id":"10756736","text":"Standing Bear, Susette Primeau, and their son The Ponca Tribe of Nebraska is one of two federally recognized tribes of Ponca people.

Since the passage of the Ponca Restoration Act, the tribe has the legal right to conduct business in Iowa. Government The Ponca Tribe of Nebraska is headquartered in Niobrara, Nebraska. The tribe is governed by a democratically elected council. Larry Wright Jr. is currently serving as tribal chairperson. History Ponca people are thought to have migrated to the Great Plains from the Ohio River valley. In the mid-16th century, Ponca people migrated with the Kansa, Omaha, and Osage north, up the Mississippi. They separated from the Omaha in the mid-17th century but reunited with them near the Niobrara River of Nebraska in 1793. Introduced European diseases had killed 90% of the Ponca people by 1804, when the Lewis and Clark Expedition arrived in their lands.Pritzker 353 The Ponca signed their first treaty with the United States in 1817, ceding two million acres of their lands. In 1858, their reservation had been reduced to 100,000 acres. Poncas were removed to Indian Territory; however, 25% of the tribe died from disease and starvation in a single year. Chief Standing Bear led a group on a 500-mile walking trek back to their homelands in Nebraska to bury their dead. The subsequent trial, Standing Bear v. Crook established the writ of habeas corpus for the first time for Native Americans, also allowed the Poncas to have lands restored to them in Nebraska. Niobrara Island was included in the original reservation. In the 1930s, an archeological survey was begun on the Ponca/Niobrara Reservation south of the Niobrara River and Lynch, Nebraska. In an effort to identify and save prehistoric artifacts before they were destroyed during agricultural development, the University of Nebraska and the Smithsonian Institution undertook a joint project. The team excavated a prehistoric Ponca village; the ten laborers on the project were paid by the Works Progress Administration of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression. The project was to survey, identify and protect ancient resources. The Ponca village included large circular homes up to sixty feet in diameter; their residences were located for almost two miles (3 km) along the south bank of the Niobrara River.

In the 1950s, the United States government unilaterally terminated recognition of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska. Since 1990, the tribe reacquired 413 acres of their lost lands. The US government finally re-recognized the tribe in 1990.Pritzker 353–354 In 2018 farmers Helen and Art Tanderup gifted and deeded 1.6 acres of their land near Neligh, Nebraska, which had been in their family for 137 years, back to the tribe in the first ceremony of its kind; the Fifth Annual planting of sacred Ponca corn also took place. The land lies in the path of the historic Trail of Tears as well as the Keystone XL Pipeline.

It was the first of many laws intended to regulate the transportation of immigrants and to protect emigrants on board ships from exploitation by transportation companies (such as exorbitant rates and consequent subjection to poor sanitary conditions). The Passenger Act required improved conditions relating to hygiene, food and comfort for passengers travelling to North America. However, this law was not always followed by transportation providers and the spread of infectious diseases such as typhus continued. This act was established under humanitarian pretences, but the more practical and desired effect was to raise the cost of passage to prevent as many as possible from leaving. Landlords who feared the emigration of their tenants lobbied extensively for this piece of legislation, and where one could previously travel to Canada for £3–4,Approximately £200 in 2001 pounds, according to the price indices in House of Commons Research Paper 02/44, , 11 July 2002 the price for the same passage was in some cases raised to £10 or more (). The ability to move abroad was subsequently limited to a small class of people until it was repealed in 1826.

It initially referred to a cluster or cycle of late 20th-century British films that were argued to depict the United Kingdom of the pre-World War II decades in a nostalgic fashion. However, this original polemic use has broadened out, and the term is now also used more loosely to refer to period films with high-quality visual production values, including those produced in France, other European countries and beyond. Many – but not all – 'heritage films' were adapted from classic literature of the 19th and early 20th centuries. For its critics on the political Left, however, the 'heritage film' was defined more centrally by: * A particular aesthetic approach (the 'heritage' or 'museum' aesthetic), marked by scrupulous attention to period detail and the use of splendid scenes of the English landscape, which was argued to have conservative ideological effects. * A perceived relationship to the rise since the 1970s of the heritage industry and the discovery of 'heritage' (stately homes, etc.) as a marketable commodity. * The official promotion of a politically conservative, pro–free enterprise and upper-class-biased notion of the British heritage by successive 1980s British Conservative Governments under the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher. At a time of British industrial decline, stagnant economic growth, political polarisation and social unrest, heritage films were appealing to many because they projected a nostalgic image of Britain as a prosperous, powerful and socially cohesive nation. Many cinematic and televised films focused on the British Empire, particularly the British Raj in India. However, while these films glorify and romanticize, they also provide a critique of the oppressive restrictions of British society and the superiority, arrogance, and controlled manner of the ruling classes. Maurice (1987) and Another Country (1984) were concerned with sexual repression and the intolerance of English society in the early 20th century, while Heat and Dust (1983) and A Passage to India (1984) criticized the ignorance of British authorities in India and the inequities of colonialism. Other critics point out that the representations, themes and perspectives presented in 'heritage films' are varied, not homogeneous, and many of them are romance narratives, suggesting that the pleasures they offer to audiences are more diverse – and less necessarily 'conservative' – than those assumed by their original critics. Criticism The 'heritage film' has been criticised from a socialist perspective for its romanticised portrayal of the past, its emphasis on the bourgeoisie or aristocracy rather than working class, and its fascination with luxurious settings, clothing, and lifestyles. Its critics argued that the films reduced the past to a lavish consumer experience, presenting it as spectacle rather than offering audiences historical or critical understanding. This argument was strongly coloured by the wider, politicised and polarised, debates around British film, culture and society taking place in the Thatcher era, including similar critiques of the heritage industry itself, vehement opposition to Thatcherism among many British filmmakers and other prominent cultural figures, and counter-attacks on ‘anti-Thatcher’ films (almost always, by contrast, set in present-day Britain) by Thatcher’s supporters in the British media. A further important strand in the critical debate around 'heritage films' argues – from a feminist and pro-LGBT position – that, in contrast with their 'conservative' reputation, many of the films are strongly progressive in their gender and sexual politics. Many of the best-loved 'heritage films' focus on strong and complex female characters (more than many other popular film genres), and some focus directly on the personal struggles, social position, rights of women and LGBT individuals in ways that remain relevant and deeply moving to their contemporary audiences. In short, although the 'heritage film' became popular by providing an escape from the present – particularly in the divided social and political climate of 1980s Britain – the full picture of the films' appeal, politics, and personal value for their audiences is more complex. Not all British films made since 1980 and set in the historic past are 'heritage films'. The 'heritage film' can be distinguished from period films that take a more self-conscious, less naturalistic, even anachronistic approach to screening narratives set in the past (the 'post-heritage film'); and from those set in more recent decades (usually 1940s onwards) that focus on characters from ordinary or working class social backgrounds, biographical subjects (biopics) and/or popular culture (the 'retro film' or 'alternative heritage film').

He was born in Avignon in 1736 and apprenticed to the gun-making trade at the age of twelve. His career spanned the decades from circa 1750 to 1801, a time period that included the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI, the American Revolution (which received military aid from Louis XVI), the French Revolution, and the French First Republic. Mass production innovation In the middle of the eighteenth century, Honoré Blanc was inspired by the work of French artillerists led by Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval, who had begun pursuing interchangeability in artillery. Their Gribeauval system involved standardization of cannons and shells. Blanc applied these concepts to muskets, and used gauges and filing jigs to bring duplicate parts to interchangeability. The uniformity of the parts was achieved via cut-and-try methods, using jigs, gauges, and master models to guide hand filing (there was no true milling at the time, although rotary filing on lathes was not unknown). As each part was filed, it was repeatedly compared against a gauge or master model (one part declared the model for all others to compare with), and the natural ability of the eyes and hands to detect small differences, such as a slight step up or down from the master to the part, ensured sufficient interchangeability. When Blanc tried to interest fellow European craftsmen in the concept, they were unreceptive, due to a combination of skepticism as to the system viability and some amount of fear that their employment and/or status might be threatened by it if it did work. So Blanc turned to Thomas Jefferson, at that time the American Ambassador to France; Jefferson quickly realized that such a system would free America from dependence on European sources for military equipment. Jefferson tried to persuade Blanc to move to America, but was not successful, so he wrote to the American Secretary of War with the idea, and when he returned to the USA he worked to fund its development. President George Washington approved of the idea, and by 1798 a contract was issued to Eli Whitney for 12,000 muskets built under the new system.James Burke, Connections (Little, Brown and Co.), 1978/1995 , p. 150 Blanc's work, and that of other French military officers led first by General Gribeauval and later by Major Louis de Tousard (who took his ideas with him into the newly established American military), formed the basis for the later development of interchangeable manufacture by the American military and its civilian contractors.. Blanc, and interchangeable musket parts experiment, is highlighted in a multi-page footnote in Mémoire sur la fabrication des armes portatives de guerre by Gaspard Hermann Cotty (1806). There were \\"50 or 60\\" rifles and LeBlanc first developed the technique in 1777, demonstrating it just before the French Revolution. Roe (1916) mentions an unknown French inventor in whose work Thomas Jefferson took an interest circa 1785 and remembered years later as a \\"Mr Le Blanc\\".. Hounshell (1984) confirms that this inventor was Honoré Blanc. References Bibliography * .

Archaeologists believe it functioned as a temple or religious structure. It contains two large mounds, many smaller mounds, and multiple human figures and heads believes to depict deities or divine rulers. Large crows would gather at this site to observe and participate in rituals or ceremonies associated with the mounds. It is only one of the large sites of the Casma/Sechin culture in the Casma and Sechin River valleys. The others are Cerro Sechin, Sechin Alto, and Sechin Bajo. The Sechin River is a tributary of the Casma River. History of research The site was first investigated by Peruvian archaeologist Julio C. Tello. His student Toribio Mejia Xesspe discovered large polychrome figures at Mojeque which are a striking feature of the complex. The images include the picture of the \\"Weeping God\\", found also at other Andean sites. The complex was thought originally to belong to the Chavin culture. American archaeologists Thomas and Sheila Pozorski studied the site in the 1980s. They placed its construction in the \\"Initial period\\", 1800 BC to 900 BC (i.e. before Chavin). The Pozorskis also saw that the site links with the neighboring Pampa de las Llamas complex. Mounds There are two very large pyramid-shaped mounds: \\"Moxeke\\" and \\"Huaca A\\", 1.3 km apart. They are aligned precisely to N 41° E. In the vicinity, there are also scattered more than 100 small mound structures aligned with the main mounds. The whole site covers about 2 km2.Jerry D. Moore, Architecture and Power in the Ancient Andes: The Archaeology of Public Buildings. Cambridge University Press, 1996 The site also contains the remains of many other buildings, including the administrative buildings, and groups of residences of different sizes. Moxeke, the main mound, is a stepped pyramid containing at least six platforms. It was about 30 m in height, and almost quadrangular: about 160 by 170 m. It was built from megalithic stones, also using conical adobe bricks. The Pozorskis also found some evidence that there was still earlier construction on the site.Jerry D.

It is home to a windmill and lake (pictured below). The town is a local center of tourism with generous bathing facilities. Originally a tiny peasant dwelling owned by the Heiligenkreuz Abbey, the economy is now based on tourism and quality wine making. Geography Podersdorf is located on the eastern shore of Lake Neusiedl, 121 meters over the sea level. It is the only village where access to the lake is not impeded by mud reed growth. The region between Neusiedl am See and Hungary is known as Seewinkel and is part of the Little Hungarian Plain. This flat and mostly treeless Puszta with numerous small lakes and ponds shows a unique flora and fauna. The town is part of the national park Neusiedler See-Seewinkel. 2001, the cultural landscape has been appointed World Cultural Heritage. History Discoveries from the Stone Age and Bronze Age show that the area around Podersdorf has been populated for a very long time. 9 AC the province 'Pannonia' was established. Deforestation of oak woods by early dwellers lead to the bleak Puszta landscape that predominates today. Podersdorf was regularly exposed to raiding horse people like the Huns, Magyars or Avars. In the 13th century the earl Poth took over Podersdorf and Potzneusiedl, what explains the name change from Altdorf to Podersdorf. In the donation document of the year 1217, which is an evidence of the donation to the Cistercian Order instructed by King Andreas II, the village is evidenced by documents for the first time. Until 1919/20, Podersdorf was named 'Patfal' and was part of Hungary. After the First World War, Burgenland was named Deutsch-Westungarn (German-West Hungary) in the 1919 Treaty of St. Germain and the Treaty of Trianon and was awarded to Austria in 1919. Since 1921, the town has been part of the newly founded State of Burgenland. Population Tourism Podersdorf is the biggest most popular touristic town within the Seewinkel. The village is favored by ornithologists, water sport enthusiasts and nature lovers. The protected pannonian landscape and the countless local Heurigen serve as destinations for cyclists and hikers.

History  = Construction = The line was constructed by the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Railway (NY&C;) between Picton (on the Leeds Northern's 1852 route between Northallerton and Stockton) and Grosmont. It was opened in 1857 from Picton to Stokesley, with intermediate stations at Trenholme Bar, Potto and Sexhow. The line included a two-mile branch south from Potto to the mines at Whorlton. The NY&C; was incorporated into the North Eastern Railway (NER) in 1858, the same year the Rosedale Branch Line for the Rosedale mines was purchased from private owners and began conversion from narrow gauge to standard gauge. It was left to NER to finish the line to Grosmont via Battersby. This and the link line to Nunthorpe were completed in stages to 1865. = Stations = There were seven stations on the Picton to Battersby section of the NY&C.; *Picton :Picton is the station at which the line met the Leeds Northern's route between Northallerton and Stockton, which is now the Northallerton–Eaglescliffe line.

Stokesley station featured comprehensively in the BTF production \\"A farmer moves south\\" and is therefore one of the best documented of the closed rural stations. *Ingleby :This station served the village of Ingleby Greenhow from 1858 to 1954. The station building remains. *Battersby :Originally called Ingleby Junction in 1858, then Battersby Junction from 1878, before finally becoming Battersby in 1893, the station is the only one on the line to remain in use, as part of the Esk Valley line. Whorlton branch A branch to the ironstone mines at Ailesbury and Swainby left the line southwards after Potto station. This was opened with the initial section of the line and forwarded two ironstone trains per day to the furnaces on Teesside. The mines were exhausted in 1887 and the branch was closed in 1892. Closure When the freight from the mines ceased, the passenger services along the Picton–Battersby and Esk Valley lines still remained important to the region, despite competition along the coast lines, with seven weekday trains along the line between Teesside and Whitby in 1900. However, this dropped to four in 1922 and by 1954 it was only two. Passenger services were withdrawn on 14 June 1954, with goods traffic ending west of Stokesley in 1958. Freight traffic remained between Stokesley and Battersby until 1965, when it too ceased, and the line dropped completely out of use. Battersby station (originally Ingleby Junction, later Battersby Junction in 1878, and its current name from 1893) and the line to Grosmont remain as part of the Esk Valley line.

Geography  Potzneusiedl is the smallest village of the Neusiedl district located on the northern edge of Parndorf Plain, on the southern embankment of the river Leitha.  History  The territory of this village has been settled since the remote past. Numerous archaeological finds from the Younger Stone Age. Bronze Age and Roman period testify to it. Graves and remains of Roman settlement above all abundantly represent the latter. The East Frankish King Louis II. the German Donated the territory of the village then called Lithana to the Bishopric of Passau back in 833. The name Pozkneuselde similar to the one used now appeared only in the second half of the 13th century - the villages of Potzneusiedl and Podersdorf were founded by the Counts of Poth. The syllable \\"Potz-\\" and \\"Pod-\\" in those villages’ names are reminding us upon their founders. The 1529 Turkish raid caused a lot of damage and it had to be re-colonized in the second half of the 16th century by Croatians. The village was in the ownership of the Harrach estate seated in Bruck an der Leitha. Its later owners were the family Bender and Batthyány, who included the village in their Kittsee estate in the 19th century. It was also the time, when the Baroque castle and tobacco factory were built in Potzneusiedl. Although the local infrastructure improved in the course of the 20th century, its industrial traditions did not develop further. Potzneusiedl, like the rest of Burgenland, belonged to Hungary until 1920/21. After the end of the First World War, the territory of West-Hungary was given to Austria by the Treaties of St. Germain and Trianon. Since 1921, the town has belonged to the newly founded State of Burgenland. Potzneusiedl joined Gattendorf for some time, but now it is an independent village again. = Castle = The construction of the present castle had been started on the year 1798 and was finalised in 1808. Partly the walls of the castle are grounded on gothic foundation walls. It is a three- wing building with a charming park surrounding it. Until 1956 the castle had been the residence of the Batthyány Family (Luise Bathany is buried in the eastern party of the graveyard of the castle). During that time the castle was known as centre of magnificent parties and social events. From 1966 it has been revitalised as a centre for art and antiques. In 1970 Austria's first Museum of Icons was founded in the castle.Castle Potzneusiedl It has been renovated continuously. Since 1993 the Potzneusiedl Theater Summer performs in the castle. Since 2001 it is the headquarters of the Romanian-Austrian Cultural Institute.Romanian-Austrian Cultural Institute = Church of St.Marco = The most important sacred monument of the village is the Roman Catholic church of St. Marco built on medieval foundations and mentioned for the first time in the 13th century. In its interior can one admire the main altars with the painting of St. Marco, statues of Sts. Peter and Paul and the Rococo side altar of St.Sebastian.

Locks Heath is immediately surrounded by a collection of villages including Sarisbury to the West, Swanwick, Park Gate and Whiteley to the North, Warsash to the South West and Titchfield to the South East. The population of the village itself in 2011 was 7,104 whilst the wider Locks Heath residential area (including surrounding villages) equaled 43,359 as of 2011. Origin of name The heathland surrounding Locks Farm. History St John the Baptist, Locks Heath In the late 19th and early 20th Century, the most important local activity in this area was strawberry growing. The industry developed as a result of the 1866 Enclosure Acts which allowed the common land to be split into a large number of small plots. The new plot owners needed a crop that would give them a quick income from a small outlay. The combination of suitable soils and a mild climate, free from spring frosts, proved ideal for the production of early cropping strawberries. Their early ripening made them desirable in markets across the country. Swanwick railway station opened on 2 September 1889 and helped to facilitate the transportation of large quantities of strawberries to customers all over the country. Strawberries were transported to the waiting trains by horse and cart. A lasting reminder of this is a rail on the outside edge of what is now the pavement leading down the hill to the station. This was used to line up the wheels of the horse-drawn carts, so as to enable easy unloading of the carts. The station was also originally much bigger with what remains of a second branch line still visible under the tarmac of what is now the station car park. A short way from the station a warehouse can be seen which used to be the 'Swanwick and District Basket Factory' which supplied the baskets to pack the strawberries into for transportation. The outline of the old signage is still visible on the outside of the building. The strawberry industry hit its peak in the 1920s and then began to slip into decline. This was caused by a variety of factors, including the demand for development land, competition from abroad and the increasingly strict requirements of retailers for standardised products. Although strawberries are still grown in the area, much of the land once used is now covered with houses. Because of the nature of the plots of land which were once the strawberry farms, many of the houses are built in relatively small estates. The mixture of old and new gives Locks Heath a unique character, and there are numerous references to strawberries in the area, such as The Talisman pub (Talisman being a variety of strawberry) and the Joseph Paxton pub, the name of a locally grown strawberry named after the gardener and designer of Crystal Palace. Facilities The mid-1980s saw significant development of the Locks Heath area with the construction of new housing and The Lockswood centre was built to provide additional facilities including The Lock Stock and Barrel pub and a supermarket. The centre now provides a focal point for the area and also includes a library/community centre and a GP surgery which, as of May 2013, is only accepting additional people from Warsash. =Schools= There are many junior schools including St.Johns School and Locks Heath Junior School where most of the Locks Heath infants pupils go to after they leave primary school, Hook-with-Warsash Junior School, Park Gate Primary School and Sarisbury Junior School. The only state secondary school is Brookfield Community School where an average 90% of pupils transfer to. Sport and leisure Locks Heath has a Non-League football club Locks Heath F.C. who play at Locks Heath Recreation ground on Warsash Road since 1894. They are currently playing in the Hampshire Premier League. Locks heath also has another football Club, called Locks Heath Lions for young people ages 5–18. Also in Locks Heath is a badminton club, bowls and tennis club.

She was built at Quesnel by pioneer shipbuilder James Trahey of Victoria for Gustavus Blin-Wright and Captain Thomas Wright and was put into service in the spring of 1869 to augment the service of the Enterprise also built by Trahey for the Wrights. Although the Victoria's hull was new, her engines and boiler had originally been in the Prince of Wales from Lillooet Lake. The Victoria was the second of twelve sternwheelers that would work on this section of the Fraser. She was larger than the Enterprise and more powerful. The two steamers worked together for only three years, when in 1871, the Enterprise was taken up to Takla Landing and abandoned on Trembleur Lake. The Victoria would work alone on the Soda Creek to Quesnel route for fifteen more years until 1886. The route The Fraser River was not considered navigable by sternwheeler between Yale and Soda Creek due to many hazardous canyons and rapids. The last obstacle to navigation was just downriver from Soda Creek, the Soda Creek Canyon, so the terminus of river navigation on the upper Fraser River was located at Soda Creek. From there a steamer could travel with no obstructions to Quesnel where a stage road ran to Barkerville. The stages of Barnard's Express would travel on the Cariboo Road up from Yale and connect with the Victoria at Soda Creek, a distance of 167 miles. Passengers and freight would then be transferred onto the sternwheeler and travel upriver 56 miles to Quesnel. Once there they would be transferred to company stages again to Barkerville for the last 54 miles. The Victoria made this trip three times a week, from May to October, from 1869 until 1886. She would be taken out of the river and berthed at Steamboat Landing near Alexandria in the fall of 1886. With her departure the upper Fraser River would be without steamer service until 1906.

Characteristics of Anemonefish  Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes that, in the wild, form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones and are unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone, see . The sea anemone protects the clownfish from predators, as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles.

Clownfish are small-sized, , and depending on species, they are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches.

Clownfish are found in warmer waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans and the Red Sea in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons. In a group of clownfish, there is a strict dominance hierarchy. The largest and most aggressive fish is female and is found at the top. Only two clownfish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce through external fertilization. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning that they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. Description The fish's body is yellow-orange to dark brown. As the name suggests, the two-banded anemonefish has two white bands or bars, with black edges. The head-bar considerably wider. They have 9-10 dorsal spines, 2 anal spines, 15-17 dorsal soft rays and 13-14 anal soft rays. Males grow to a length of , and females grow to a length of . =Color variation= The principal variation is that the body can be yellow-orange to dark brown. =Similar species= A pattern of two white bars is common to species within the clarkii complex sub genus. The yellow caudal fin of A. bicinctus distinguishes it from all but A. latifasciatus and some variations of A. clarkii, however A. clarkii has a white base with a sharp demarcation between light and dark. A. latifasciatus has a much wider mid-body bar and forked caudal fin. The caudal fin on A. allardi and A. chagosensis is white or whitish.

Distribution and Habitat The species is found in the Western Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, Socotra and the Chagos archipelago. =Host anemones= The relationship between anemonefish and their host sea anemones is not random, instead being highly nested in structure. A. bicinctus is generalist, being hosted by the following 5 species of anemones: *Entacmaea quadricolor Bubble- tip anemone *Heteractis aurora white beaded anemone *Heteractis crispa Sebae anemone *Heteractis magnifica magnificent sea anemone *Stichodactyla gigantea giant carpet anemone Studies conducted in the northern Red Sea have demonstrated that A. bicinctus has a preference for E. quadricolor over H. crispa and sexually mature fish are rarely hosted by H. crispa. In 2005, anemone density was found to affect whether H. crispa hosted anemonefish, with clusters of juvenile fish only found at low density sites, while either 1 or no juvenile anemonefish were found in H. crispa at the high density site. The authors theorised that H. crispa was a nursery anemone due to being unable to adequately protect adult anemonefish from predation, active emigration of fish to E. quadricolor and/or environmentally-controlled cessation of fish growth. A subsequent study in 2012 tested the nursery theory and concluded that the sea anemone H. crispa was a less-preferred host than E. quadricolor, and that fish preference appeared to be the result of body size, morphology, and behavior of the host.

History as Chicago and North Western Railway The dominant railroad in southern Minnesota was the Chicago and North Western, and by 1875 had all of its mainlines complete in Minnesota. For the next 35 years, it would develop its branch lines, especially in Southwestern Minnesota. Like most other major railroads, the CNW overbuilt; meaning every town in extreme Southwest Minnesota had a railroad by 1900. Many of these branch lines had a temporary boom of business but soon were operating at a loss. The main business was based on agriculture products and the railroads were often a victim of poor crop years, which was often. The mainline into Worthington runs from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Sioux City, Iowa. It was built by the St. Paul & Sioux City R.R. Being the mainline, it had control of all railroads shipping west into Dakota Territory. In 1876, the Southern Minnesota Railroad planned to build a Mainline along the Minnesota and Iowa border from Wisconsin to Dakota Territory, running through Worthington, Minnesota and ending in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The St. Paul & Sioux City Railroad did not want a competing railroad in this area and began surveying and laying rail out of Worthington to the west. Their goal was to reach Luverne, Minnesota in the same year. The name of this line was the Worthington & Sioux Falls RR later changed to the Worthington & Dakota Railroad. The first name was so that the Southern Minnesota Railroad knew exactly where the new line was running to try and discourage them from building their own. The Worthington & Dakota Railroad began laying track in July 1876 and in mid-August had reached Adrian and started running trains immediately. The first train to Luverne was on October 2, 1876, but since the Little Rock River Bridge was not yet complete, the train had to stop 1/2 mile from town. Passengers had to either walk to town or take the stagecoach. A few weeks later, the bridge was complete and rails were laid into Luverne. The Southern Minnesota Railroad had given up on its plan to build the mainline due to the swift progress of the Worthington & Dakota. The rail from Luverne to Sioux Falls was then completed in the spring of 1878. The building of the railroad to Luverne brought a flood of immigrants to the area and the railroad had to run extra trains to handle all the passengers. With this increased service to the area, the construction crews returned in 1880 and built a branch line to Doon, Iowa. It was the only railroad in the area until a few years later when the Great Northern Railway built a branch line in the area. The Doon line was abandoned in 1933. The rail size here was 45 pound; today, it ranges from 80 to 135 pound. In 1901, a turntable was built here for turning locomotives. It was removed in 1964 when the diesels replaced the steam engines. In 1913, the present passenger depot was built in Luverne along with a freight depot. The freight depot was removed in 1991. About 1986 or 1987, Chicago and North Western (CNW) closed down a rail line that ran from Agate Junction, just west of Worthington, MN, to Sioux Falls, SD. After Chicago and North Western Railway About 1988, Larry Wood, of the Minnesota Valley Transportation, Inc. (MNVA), bought the line and named it the Buffalo Ridge Railroad (BFRR). The BFRR operated until June 1992. The track speed was 10 mph. The line remained closed until July 1993. The railroad operated between Agate Junction, just west of Worthington, MN, to Sioux Falls, SD. Buffalo Ridge Rail Authority The Buffalo Ridge Rail Authority bought the line and Rail Equipment and Transportation, Inc. (RETI), owned by Bill Dahlin and Dirk Lenthe, were contracted to operate on the line. This line ran from Agate Junction to Manley Interchange, located 1 mile east of the South Dakota state line. The railroad was named Nobles Rock Railroad (NRR) after the two counties that the rail crosses. RETI started a re-habilitation project that lasted two years. The track speed was 10 mph. RETI closed the railroad on March 13, 1998. NRR trackage rights was quickly bought and was operating under new ownership by April 1, 1998. Tim Tennant, President/CEO of Cascade Railcorp, purchased the lease on the line. In August 1999, Cascade Railcorp also invested in two other rail lines, the Minnesota Central and the NRR Dakota Division. Both of these railroads were in trouble. The Minnesota Central was based out of Morton, Minnesota and the NRR Dakota Division was based out of White Lake, South Dakota. Both railroads needed a lot of work. By July 2000, the Dakota Division had derailment bills that totaled in excess of $1 million dollars. The Dakota Division had the potential to make money, but the rail needed improvement to make it profitable. Cascade Railcorp called on the State of South Dakota for assistance. The State of South Dakota was uncooperative about granting Cascade Railcorp any money to give the line a much needed rehabilitation. NRR Dakota Division subleased the track from Dakota Southern Railway for the ten months that the NRR Dakota Division operated. As a comparison of cost of operation, Dakota Southern Railway in the twenty-five years it operated before being sold to new owners effective Oct. 1, 2009 never had a derailment that exceeded its $25,000 retained liability. The debts incurred in the Minnesota Central and Dakota Division were catching up with the Cascade Railcorp. In July 2000, Independent Locomotive Service of Bethel, Minnesota recalled all the locomotives leased by Cascade Railcorp. Cascade Railcorp was more than $100,000 in debt on lease payments. This stopped traffic on all three lines. In August 2000, Cascade Railcorp filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 2001, the Buffalo Ridge Rail Authority awarded the operational lease to Minnesota Southern Railway, owned by Brent Polanchek. In 2017, the Ellis & Eastern Company purchased the Minnesota Southern Railway and its system, thus ending the railroad's operations.

They are situated on the south side of the southwest branch of the Arwa Valley, south of the dry lake Arwa Tal, and northwest of Badrinath. To their south lies the Bhagirath Kharak Glacier. Lying near the border with Tibet, these peaks have restricted access, and they have not been frequented by climbers until recently. However their steep, rocky profiles offer an extreme challenge to high-level rock climbers. The three peaks lie close together and share a base camp. Reaching the base camp in the Arwa Valley, at an elevation of 4,350 m (14,270 ft), requires a three-day trek from Badrinath. All these peaks are on the Arwa-Bagneu divide and can also be approached from the south. Arwa Tower The Arwa Tower is a peak with a huge rocky ridge along with a steep granite wall. The summit is a needle-like tower on the east ridge. The massif is flanked by many steep buttresses. The First ascent of the Tower was made by Britons Mick Fowler and Steve Sustad on 14 May 1999, via the northwest face.American Alpine Journal, 2000, pp. 46-55.

She wrote numerous poems and songs. Early years Venkamamba was born into a family of Vangipuram (Vengipuram) sect of brahmins in 1730 in the Tarigonda village of Andhra Pradesh state. Her father was Krishnayamatya and mother was Mangamamba. Since childhood, she was an ardent devotee of Lord Venkateswara and her devotion made the villagers believe that she was insane. Married at a very early age (common practice in those times), she lost her husband Venkatachalapathi and became a child-widow. However, she refused to accept anyone but the Lord as her husband and continued to dress as a married woman (such as wearing mangalsutra, non-white clothing, bottu/bindi). She studied yoga sciences under Acharya (professor) Subrahmnayudu and became a yogini. As a result, she faced resentment of the local priest in Tarigonda, and shifted to Tirumala. She was welcomed by the priest and descendants of Annamayya, all who had heard of her devotion prior to her move. Vengamamba's Harathi Moved by her devotion, it is told that Lord Venkateswara allowed her to enter the temple after temple hours to hear her poems and songs. Venkamamba recited poems and took 'harati' of the Lord each night and paid pearls as fee to the Lord. Observing pearls in the sanctum sanctorum over a period of time, the priests' investigation led to Venkamamba. Their punishment was to exile her to a cave in Tumburakona, a distance of 15 miles from Tirumala. The legend goes on that He created a secret passage from the cave to the temple which was used by Venkamamba to continue her devotional service. The practice of penance and night harati continued for 6 years. Eventually, the priests realized their folly and recognized Venkamamba's devotion and dedication, and requested her to return. Upon return, she was allowed to participate in Ekanta seva and take the final harati of the Lord. The area around her brindavan (samādhi) was later converted into a school (S.V.B.N.R high school tirumala), with the brindavan still open for pilgrims' worship in the school playground. Literary works Her first poem was Tarigonda Nrusimha Satakam and it was followed by Nrusimha Vilasa Katha, Siva Natakam and Balakrishna Natakam as Yakshaganam and Rajayogamrutha Saram, a Dwipada Kavyam. These works were completed when she was in Tarikonda. On her return to Tirumala from Tumburakona caves, Venkamamba composed Vishnu Parijatham, Chenchu Natakam, Rukmini Natakam and Jala Krida Vilasam and Mukthi Kanthi Vilasam (all Yaksha Ganams), Gopi Natakam (Golla Kalapam-Yakshaganam), Rama Parinayam, Sri Bhagavatham, Sri Krishna Manjari, Tatva Keerthanalu and Vashista Ramayanam (Dwipada), Sri Venkataachala MahatyamSri Venkatachala Mahatmyam 1928 book in Archives.com (Padya Prabhandam) and Ashtanga Yoga,Saram (Padyakruthi). Ekanta Seva Since the Lord accepted Venkamamba's devotion, her harati has been incorporated into Ekanta Seva performed to the Lord each night. A descendant of Venkamamba pays pearls as fee and the harati is called Venkamamba's harati. Movies based on life of Vengamamba The Movie Venkamamba is released in 2009 by Duraiswamy Raju and has Meena Durairaj playing the lead, portraying Venkamamba. M. M.

Career as bandleader Living in the city of Cojimar, he learned classical piano from the age of 4, and went on to study at the Falcón Conservatory in Havana. By 1934 his classical training ended because of his family's financial hardship, and he accepted a job as a pianist in Luis Rivera's jazz band. Soon afterwards he became the leader of a 16-piece orchestra, playing big band music at the Grand Casino in Havana, and also began writing his own compositions. One of his most famous songs, \\"No Te Importe Saber\\", was recorded with lyrics by Mitchell Parish as \\"Let Me Love You Tonight\\", by Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and others. In 1944, after his club in Cuba was destroyed by a hurricane, Touzet moved to the USA where he joined a band led by Enric Madriguera. The band then moved to Hollywood, where Touzet met Desi Arnaz, and joined his band for a while. He also worked as pianist, songwriter and arranger with Xavier Cugat and Stan Kenton. GNP 113 - El Loco Cha Cha (1956) After forming his own orchestra in the mid-1950s, he successfully recorded eleven albums for producer Gene Norman on his GNP Crescendo label between 1955 and 1964, and performed regularly at Norman's Crescendo night club. One of his best known arrangements of this period, \\"El Loco Cha Cha\\", provided R&B; singer Richard Berry with the \\"riff\\" for his classic pop song \\"Louie Louie\\". Touzet remained a popular bandleader through the 1960s, incorporating pachangas and other new rhythms into his compositions, without losing touch with the boleros and cha-chas that brought him his first fame. Later years and family In 1972 Touzet retired from performing popular music and moved to Miami, Florida, devoting his remaining years to composing for the piano, in a style blending Cuban folk music and jazz with classical music. His published compositions for piano include Cuarenta Danzas, Cuatro Caprichos, Ginasteriana, Fantasía Española, Cinco Danzas Exóticas, Vals Arabesco, Tres Miniaturas, and the Sonata Romántica. Touzet was married to Isabel Gonzalez (1917-1991) and they had two daughters, Olivia and Nilda Touzet-Gonzalez. He had three other daughters: Olga Maria Touzet-Guillot (with singer Olga Guillot), Lisa Bahadoor, and Bonita Calderon. He later married Mercy Remos. Touzet was given several honors and awards for his musical contributions, and in 2001 the mayor of Miami declared September 9 as \\"René Touzet Day.\\" He died of heart complications in 2003.

Its headquarters, community hall and social centre are on Victoria Drive and 33rd Avenue, near Kingsway in East Vancouver.  History  The Vancouver Alpen Club was founded by Bavarian immigrant Sebastian Schmidt and other German and Austrian immigrants in 1935, though it did not receive its provincial charter until 1938. The purpose of the club was to preserve the German language and culture, while being non-political. It \\"owed its early success to the Schuhplattler, a German folk dance which originated in the Bavarian and Tyrolean Alps, thus giving the name Alpen Club to the organization.\\" The club's focus on dance, rather than politics was reflected in its original slogan, \\"Get away from politics and let's schuhplattle.\\" Originally, the club met at a house rented by Schmidt on the corner of Robson and Cambie. The organization outgrew the location, and meetings were held at Homer Hall, Winter Garden, English Bay pier, and Hamilton Hall at the corner of Hamilton and Dunsmuir. Club activities included: folk dancing, concerts, a choir, German language instruction, calisthenics classes, and food and beverage service. In 1936, the club's Schuhplattler dance group won the trophy for best folk dance at the Canadian Folk Festival in Vancouver. = The World War II Period = The Vancouver Alpen Club was the only German club in North America to stay open during World War II. \\"This was largely influenced by the Canadian Folk Society who urged members to keep on with their Schuhplattler, and also to the fact they had never been tinged with political influences.\\" During the War, the club's \\"liquor permit was cancelled, the dances stopped, and all non- naturalized Germans were evacuated from the coastal areas. In 1940 the German language classes ended and in 1941 the shutters were pulled down in the [Hamilton] hall.\\" In January 1945, club members formed a building committee and began fundraising for their own hall.  The Post-War Period  By the end of 1946, the club was able to purchase the property at Victoria Drive and 33rd Avenue. \\"Eventually, this property was added to until Club holdings consisted of eight lots.\\" The building was officially opened on October 19, 1950. The club's membership increased steadily during the post-war period, as there was an influx of German-speaking immigrants to the Vancouver Lower Mainland. During the 1950s, the club produced stage productions, supported soccer teams in the Mainland League, and maintained its choir.  The Current Vancouver Alpen Club  The Vancouver Alpen Club's restaurant, Deutsches Haus, serves German cuisine and beers. Sub-groups within the club include the Alpen Plattlers, a Schuhplatter dance group, choirs and card players.

It cuts the city in two, diagonally with respect to the grid pattern of the surrounding streets, hence the name. It was originally projected by engineer and urban planner Ildefons Cerdà as one of the city's wide avenues, which along with Avinguda Meridiana would cut the rationalist grid he designed for l'Eixample (Catalan for extension). Both would meet at Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes, which Cerdà envisioned as the new city centre. However, Plaça Catalunya, equally a new addition to the city of Barcelona, and connecting Ciutat Vella and Eixample, and therefore occupying a more privileged position in the urban area, would finally become the centre. Avinguda Diagonal remains to this day a much- transited avenue and many companies and hotels use it as a privileged location, as can be seen in its architecture. The avenue starts in the Les Corts district on the western edge of the city and runs to the Sant Martí district on the eastern edge. To its west, it connects with the Lleida-Madrid highway and Ronda de Dalt in the neighbouring municipality of Esplugues de Llobregat. To its east, it meets the Ronda del Litoral on the border with the municipality of Sant Adrià de Besòs. It is consistently wide and about long. Name The different regimes that held power in Catalonia and Spain during the 20th century sought to change the city's street names, and Avinguda Diagonal was permitted no exception. It has been known under the following names: * Gran Via Diagonal – original name which Ildefons Cerdà and Víctor Balaguer intended to call the avenue. * Avinguda d'Argüelles – 1891. Named after Agustín Argüelles (1776–1844). * Avinguda de la Nacionalitat Catalana – 1922. Mancomunitat de Catalunya, (in English, Commonwealth of Catalonia). * Avenida de Alfonso XIII −1924. During Miguel Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, named after King Alfonso XIII. * Avinguda del Catorze d'Abril – 1931. Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). * Gran Vía Diagonal – 1939, provisional name imposed the day after the Fascist capture of Barcelona as an attempt to eliminate references to the Republic. * Avenida del Generalísimo Francisco Franco – 1939. During the authoritarian regime of Francisco Franco. * Avinguda Diagonal – Its current name, adopted following the restoration of democracy in 1979. The name \\"Diagonal\\" has always prevailed in popular usage. History =Early history= Ildefons Cerdà's so-called Pla Cerdà was not totally successful in transforming Barcelona's urban reality, as only parts of it were finally approved. The construction of Avinguda Diagonal is one of the projects it entailed that became reality, when a Royal Decree from Queen Isabella II of Spain and Leopoldo O'Donnell's Spanish government in Madrid allowed him to start the construction of the avenue in 1859. The city council of Barcelona had previously requested the approval of Antoni Rovira i Trias's alternative project instead, which had been rejected. Apartment building on Avinguda Diagonal from the beginning of the 20th century After the completion of its central section, from the current Plaça de Francesc Macià towards Glòries, it soon became one of Barcelona's most popular avenues and an ideal place for the Catalan aristocrats and bourgeoisie to exhibit their carriages. Francesc Cambó, leader of Lliga Regionalista proposed the construction of a new palace for the then monarch Alfonso XIII in 1919 (the royal palace in Ciutat Vella had been destroyed in the fire of 1875). =Recent history= Avinguda Diagonal suffered several attacks by the Basque separatist organisation ETA in 2000. On 2 November, a car bomb exploded injuring a security officer and a municipal officer. A few days later, on 21 November, a car used by the killers of Enerst Lluch exploded in the middle of the avenue. On 20 December a municipal officer was shot dead. Four venues in the area hosted competitions for the 1992 Summer Olympics.1992 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 2. pp. 209–28. During 2010, Diagonal reform proposals were on the headlines, as the Barcelona city council had plans to make the tram cross the whole avenue. A popular consultation (the word referendum being banned by Spanish law) was scheduled for May 2010 between two reform proposals, the so-called rambla or boulevard. It resulted in a big political failure for the city mayor, Jordi Hereu. There was a bare participation of 12% of potential voters, and about 80% voted for the third option none of the former two, that is, against any change.Opción C: Varapalo al alcalde Hereu a La Vanguardia 16 May 2010 Buildings and places of interest Torre Agbar =Architecture= *Casa del Baró de Quadras (Museu de la Música) – designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch (1904–1906) *Casa Comalat – designed by Salvador Valeri i Pupurull (1906–1911) *Església del Carme – designed by Josep Domènech i Estapà, neo-Byzantine style (1909) *Casa Serra – also designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch, became a school. *Casa de Terrades, also known as Casa de les Punxes – Eixample's widest building, designed by Puig i Cadafalch (1903–1905) *ME Barcelona hotel, designed by Dominique Perrault (2007). *Palau Pérez Samanillo *Casa Sayrach – (1918) *Palau Reial de Pedralbes (1921), built for Alfonso XIII of Spain and its gardens.

Her band, Robin Lane & the Chartbusters, released three albums on Warner Bros. Records in the early 1980s, and was best known for its single \\"When Things Go Wrong\\". Robin Lane grew up in Los Angeles. Her father was Ken Lane, songwriter and pianist for Dean Martin; her mother was a model. While in her teens, Robin began singing and performing in folk-rock clubs in southern California. From 1968 to 1970 she was married to future Police lead guitarist Andy Summers. In 1969, she sang backing vocals on the song \\"Round & Round\\" on Neil Young's album Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. In the 1970s, Lane moved to eastern Pennsylvania and then to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where her musical interests turned from folk-rock to a harder sound influenced by the growing punk rock and new wave genres. In 1978, Lane formed the Chartbusters with Asa Brebner and Leroy Radcliffe (of The Modern Lovers), Scott Baerenwald and Tim Jackson. She had signed with Private Stock Records, which shortly afterward went out of business. After Jerry Wexler saw a Chartbusters show, however, he signed the band to Warner Brothers. Their first album, Robin Lane & the Chartbusters (1980) featured the singles \\"When Things Go Wrong\\" and \\"Why Do You Tell Lies?\\", earned favorable reviews, and received widespread airplay; the music video for \\"When Things Go Wrong\\" was the 11th song shown on MTV's first American broadcast day, August 1, 1981. The band had two more releases on Warner, the EP 5 Live (1980) and Imitation Life (1981). The limited commercial success of these records, combined with business disputes and Lane's desire to have a child, led to the breakup of the Chartbusters in 1983. Lane continued writing and recording music, and released the independent EP Heart Connection (1984), the self-produced cassette In Concert (1989), and the full-length Catbird Seat (1995). She co-wrote the song \\"Wishing On Telstar\\" for the 1991 Susanna Hoffs album When You're a Boy. In 2001, Lane and several of the Chartbusters regrouped for two reunion concerts, and decided to continue recording and performing; they released Piece of Mind in 2003. Since then, Lane has moved to western Massachusetts, where she works with the Turners Falls, Massachusetts Women's Resource Center, using music therapy to aid survivors of abuse. On 4 April 2014 Tim Jackson premiered his film of Robin Lane's life and career, When Things Go Wrong, followed by a Q & A and a set by Robin Lane & the Chartbusters, at the Regent Theatre in Arlington, Massachusetts. On March 2 and 3, 2019, band members staged another reunion concert at The Burren in Somerville, Massachusetts to support the release of Many Years Ago: The Complete Robin Lane & the Chartbusters Collection (Blixa Sounds). That weekend's edition of the Chartbusters consisted of most of the original lineup: Lane on vocals and guitar, Asa Brebner on guitar, Scott Baerenwald on bass, drummer Tim Jackson, and guitarist Billy Loosigian (taking the place of original guitarist Leroy Radcliffe). Many Years Ago: The Complete Robin Lane & the Chartbusters Collection is a three-disc set. Previously released material consists of the two studio LPs, Robin Lane & the Chartbusters (1980) and Imitation Life (1981); and the 5 Live (1980) and Heart Connection EPs (1984). In addition, the set contains outtakes from the recording sessions for Heart Connection, as well as a series of demos, previously unreleased studio tracks, and various live performances.

Lawrence: An Arab View was published in 1966 and translated into English, French and Japanese. It was written after a study that had convinced him that although there were many books written to praise Lawrence and others written to discredit him, all of them exaggerated his part in the Arab Revolt and failed to do justice to the Arabs themselves.T.E Lawrence: An Arab View; by Suleiman Mousa Preface Oxford University Press, London and New York, 1966 Life Suleiman Mousa with his wife, mother and children in 1953. Mousa with his mother Farha Al-Nasser wearing traditional garb in August 1972. With a group of intellectuals at the Al-Marbed Poetry Festival in Basra, Iraq in 1988. =Youth= Suleiman Mousa was born to a Christian family in the village of Al Rafeed, in 1919; the village overlooks the Yarmouk River and is located 20 km north of Irbid. The early death of his father, an unwealthy man with a passion for reading and writing, came as a shock to him, his mother and sister while Mousa was just six years old. Leaving them little but a cane basket containing several books, his mother took up the task of securing the family's needs. They lived a simple and spontaneous life as part of the village that depended mainly on agriculture for its survival.Steps on the Road; by Suleiman Mousa خطوات على الطريق, سيرة قلم: تجربة كاتب  p. 13-21 After receiving his elementary education from religious scholars, Mousa moved to a small school known as Al Ta'ifa for three years. As were his mother's ambitions, he was then sent to a governmental school in Al Husn (الحصن), where he resided at his relatives' until May 1934, when he was unable to continue into high school due to the family's limited income. A few months later, at the age of sixteen, he took up the profession of teaching at the School of Irbid. =Employment= Suleiman Mousa, 1946 In 1936 he traveled to the city of Haifa in Palestine where he first began working. After returning to Irbid and resuming his profession as a teacher for a brief period, he decided to make the journey to Jaffa (يافا) by train, which interconnected it with Damascus and was part of the Hejaz Railway built by the Ottoman Empire. This journey had a significant impact on his cultural life as it was then that he started borrowing and purchasing books and novels from neighbouring libraries and fulfilling his passion of reading. He gradually learnt English using dictionaries, and published many articles in Palestinian newspapers as well as several short stories in 1938. As time progressed, he found himself leaning closer towards books of literature and poetry and his fascination in history developed. He returned in 1939 to Al Rafeed where he continued working in the field of education before becoming an employee in the Iraq Petroleum Company in Mafraq. In 1943 he fulfilled a substantial commitment and married Georgette Nuseir whom he had met on a visit to Nazareth.Eighty: An Autobiography (Thamanun) p.68 Mousa spent fifteen years in Mafraq and his publications were put close to a halt due to the inappropriate and illiterate environment he went through although he managed to publish a few short stories, articles and translations. A major transformation in his life occurred when Mousa moved to Amman, the Jordanian capital, and began working in the Jordanian Broadcasting Company in 1957, turning to the work of the publications service and the Ministry of Information and Culture until 1984. During that period, he was the editor of the Jordanian magazine ‘Resalat Al Ordon’ (1966 to 1967). Later on, Suleiman Mousa spent more than four years as a cultural adviser in the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM), from 1984 to 1988.Suleiman Mousa: Simplified Biography in English, by Yazan Suheil Mousa Writer and historian Mousa's first book Al Hussein Bin Ali and the Great Arab Revolt was published in 1957 where it was written when the author had been resident of Jaffa, Palestine in early 1939, when he was a mere nineteen years of age. The printing of this book occurred after nearly seventeen years of its writing.Thamanun: rehlat al ayyam wal a'wam Eighty; An Autobiography, by Suleiman Mousa pg 32 One of the most prominent works of Suleiman Mousa is T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View, which has been translated into English, French and Japanese.T.E Lawrence: An Arab View; By Suleiman Mousa (Japanese Edition) This was a turning point for the author Mousa that has taken him to world fame. He showed the Arab's point of view about battles and events of The Great Arab Revolt, and also came in response to the British book written by Lawrence himself, who did not give the Arabs their right to the full extent. The author shows that Arabs fought in large numbers in the combat revolt against the Turkish rule for independence and freedom, and that they are the ones who fought and struggled, while Lawrence was merely an officer like any other in the British Army. While the author was resident of Jaffa in 1937, his activities were expanded to English as well as Arabic history books and he purchased several books in English of which most important were The Seven Pillars of Wisdom by Lawrence and The Arab Awakening, by George Antonius, which emerged in its first edition in 1938.Steps on the Road (Khutwat Ala ALtareeq) p.16 :Mousa wrote in regard to his interest in English: :::Further information: Works by Suleiman Mousa =T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View= T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View, the only book that shows the Arab perspective on Lawrence of Arabia. Of the articles written by Suleiman Mousa in Jaffa that sparked widespread attention was an article published by the name \\"Lawrence on the balance\\" () in Al Adab () magazine (November 1955) which discussed the book written by Richard Aldington called Lawrence of Arabia: A Biographical Inquiry, which had appeared in Britain earlier that year. The idea of writing a book discussing the matter in an integrated manner from an Arab's perspective was based on the success the eight-page article received. Five years later, the first Arabic edition of the book was published by the name T.E. Lawrence: An Arab View () followed by the translations into English in 1966, French in 1973 and Japanese in 1988.Eighty: An Autobiography (Thamanun) p.80-81 The book was translated into English by Dr. Albert Boutros, a professor of English at the University of Jordan. Many Arab and Western references were used for its writing. Mousa was visited by senior Western writers, including professors Colin Wilson and Jeremy Wilson. To this day, his book remains the only one that shows the Arab viewpoint. It has left a deep impact on all researchers interested in Lawrence. Hence, the book has won global reputation, and became a reference to researchers about the subject of Lawrence and the Great Arab Revolt. Being taught in Arab and foreign universities including the University of Oxford in Britain is a sure sign of the success and attention this book has drawn. It was Professor Eugene Rogan from the University of Oxford who had remarked in a July 2000 speech: =Internationally and Locally= :Further information: Awards and honors Suleiman Mousa, in addition to being a recognized researcher who achieved a breakthrough intellectually and in the Arab World, was also a local ‘people's’ author.Suleiman Mousa: Internationally and Locally, by Issam Suleiman Mousa He wrote in four major themes: Biographies, history of Jordan, history of Arab revolution and writings in literature and short stories, in addition to the translations of Arabic and several simplified books written for young people. Mousa relied on many diverse Arab, British and foreign sources. Mousa (right) with Hussein bin Talal (middle), then King of Jordan He went to the Public Record Office in the United Kingdom in 1974 and spent four months researching documents relating to Jordan. Therefore, his works are considered indispensable references for many students and researchers. Mousa won many awards in recognition of his contributions to Jordanian and Arab history including: The Order of Independence in 1971, King Abdullah I Award for research in Islamic civilization in 1988, the State Incentive prize in 1990, the Order of Al Hussein distinguished first class in 2007 and Medal of the Arab Author after his death in 2008. Death Suleiman Mousa died on 9 June 2008, in Amman, Jordan two days prior of his eighty-ninth birthday. He died of congestive heart failure. Cultural officials participated in the funeral and wake as well as representatives of his majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan, the Ministry of Culture, the media and many more of whom have praised his contributions in various creative fields. Posthumous recognition Although Suleiman Mousa received numerous awards and honors during his lifetime, many projects have been launched posthumously in recognition of the contributions he has made to Jordanian, Middle Eastern and World history. The establishment of the Library of Suleiman Mousa at the (GAM), and the republishing of his complete works in several stages,Amman Centennial, Intellectuals and officials launched a project to republish books by the late Jordanian historian Suleiman Musa with an \\"aim of introducing history to the new generation\\", are amongst the most prominent of these projects.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Greater+Amman+Municipality+Inaugurates+Sulaiman+Mousa+Library+Next...-a0209998096 Mousa was also awarded The Arab Author Medal in 2008 after his death. =Library of Suleiman Mousa= Library of Suleiman Mousa at Al Hussein Cultural Center of the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM).On 11 November 2009, a library dedicated for the history of Jordan under the name of Suleiman Mousa, located at Al Hussein Cultural Center of the GAM, was inaugurated on behalf of the former Mayor of Amman, Omar Maani.http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/en/resource/snews.asp?id=1264 The library is divided into several sections, one for the titles related to the history of Jordan in Arabic, English and French. Another is allocated for books and personal possessions of Suleiman Mousa, as well as some documents he had been collecting during his work in writing, which his family donated to the library. At the inauguration, City Deputy Manager for Cultural, Social, and Sports Affairs, Haitham Jweinat, referred to the uniqueness of the new library, and said that it will be open for all interested readers and researchers, noting that the GAM had taken the time to equip it with many facilities, including an internet local area network (LAN) and the availability of international magazines and newspapers.http://www.ammanpl.gov.jo/solaiman.htm The library regularly receives visitors from schools and universities to introduce them to Middle Eastern history through documentaries, photos and library resources. Several scientific seminars and conferences have already taken place at the library. Its goal is to become one of the important developmental and economical projects in Jordan, and the place to launch books related to Arab history and the history of Jordan.

Lawrence: An Arab View) is worth reading. For, after all, therein lies the root of distrust which has poised Arab relations with the west for the past five decades.\\" - Anthony Nutting, Sunday Telegraph News; 10 July 1966 :\\"...However \\"nationalist\\" Mr. Mousa may be, he has been painstakingly, tediously thorough in examining this material and in assembling such evidence of Arab opinion as he could obtain...\\" - The Standard Times, 12 March 1967 :\\"...The book needed writing and deserves reading...He writes honestly, stating his evidence fairly, and his book merits the serious consideration it asks,\\" - Birmingham Post, 9 July 1966 :\\"...is the first scholarly account to give the Arab view, and it is a highly persuasive and thoroughly researched examination of the Lawrence story...Mousa is an intelligent and passionate advocate of the Arab view...\\" - Quarterly Review, Summer 1967 :\\"In T. E. Lawrence: An Arab View, Suleiman Mousa gathers a great variety of such details in an attempt to destroy the Lawrence myth. He is offended by Lawrence's egotism and has worked hard to restore the historical record to its proper proportions.\\"- Michigan Quarterly Review, Summer 1969 :\\"Suleiman Mousa's work had a deep and lasting influence over T.E. Lawrence scholarship. It showed how different those events looked through Arab eyes, and taught us to question the assumption that things happened - only, or indeed at all - because Lawrence wanted them to happen. :I believe that, in the long run, Western and Arab historians will reach a common view of the history of the Arab Revolt, based on all the evidence that has survived. By challenging the accepted Western view, Suleiman Mousa played an important part in that process. For that he deserves lasting recognition.\\".- British historian, Jeremy Wilson Awards and honors * Ali Bin Al-Hussein Medal - The Independence Medal, Second Class, 1971. * State Award for Literature, 1977. * An Honorary shield from the first conference of the History of Jordan - 1980. * Shield organized by the World Conference on the history of the King Abdul-Aziz - the Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University, Al-Riyadh - 1985. * Abdullah Bin Al-Hussein Award for Research in Islamic civilization, 1988. * Honorary gift from the Abdul Hameed Shoman Foundation and is a model of the Al-Aqsa mosque - in June 1989. * Honorary shield from the University of Jordan in appreciation for the efforts of Suleiman Mousa in the history of Jordan - 1990. * Arab Author Medal - in June 1991. * The honorary shield Faha Sports Club of the Social and Cultural - September, 1993. * The honorary shield Qurtubi Secondary School for Boys - in November 1995. * The honorary shield from the Office of the people of the town of al-Rafid, Beni Kananeh - July 1996. * The honorary shield from the Royal Medical Services - December, 1996. * The honorary shield from the Center for Strategic Studies Jordan, on the occasion of the participation of Suleiman Mousa at the Second International Conference of the social history of Jordan - Amman in July 2000 - and that in recognition of its great foundation for the writing of the history of Jordan. * Ali Bin Al-Hussein Medal - The Independence Medal of the First Order - in June 2002. * The honorary shield from the Jordanian Writers Association - January 2006. * Al-Hussein Medal for distinguished performance- May, 2007. * The Shield of the Greater Amman Municipality. * The Shield of the Ministry of Culture. * The Shield of the Jordanian television channel. * Shield from the Board of Trustees of the Documentation Center of the Hashemite monarchy of Jordan in recognition of outstanding contribution. * Arab Author Medal - August, 2008.

Original line-up The group was formed in Dortmund in 1986 with Robert Kampf on vocals, Klaus Pahura on bass, Thomas \\"Donald\\" König on drums, and Waldemar Sorychta and Marek Greschek on guitar. The following year, they released the Surviving You Always demo . König was replaced shortly after by 16-year-old drummer Markus Freiwald. Kampf launched Century Media Records in 1988 and Despair's History of Hate was the first album released by the label. In 1989, Andreas Henschel replaced Kampf at the microphone when the latter decided to devote himself to Century Media. The label went on to release the group's other two albums, Decay of Humanity (1990) and Beyond All Reason (1992). Sorychta was in charge of production on History of Hate and was the principal composer. Kampf began hiring his colleague to produce other bands on his label, with Sorychta producing albums and EPs for Unleashed, Crows, Tiamat, Asphyx and Samael. After Despair Despair disbanded in 1993. Sorychta went on to pursue a prolific career as a producer, often in association with Century Media. He formed Grip Inc. with Dave Lombardo with whom he worked on the first album by the supergroup Voodoocult. Sorychta founded Eyes of Eden and Enemy of the Sun in the 2000s as Grip Inc. dissolved. He produced Sodom's In War and Pieces in 2010. Freiwald joined bands such as Flaming Anger, Everflow and Voodoocult. He became the session drummer for Century Media groups. He also replaced Ventor in Kreator for the Endorama European tour in 1999. Bernemann contacted him in 2010, to announce that Bobby Schottkowski had decided to leave Sodom because of the deterioration of his relationship with Tom Angelripper. His debut album with Sodom was Epitome of Torture, also produced by Sorychta. Marek Greschek committed suicide in 2013. Revival Robert Kampf announced a reformation of Despair which was to include Sorychta and Freiwald in November 2004. There was no follow-up to Kampf's announcement. In September 2017, it was Sorychta's turn to announce the return of Despair. Freiwald is still behind the drums, but Marc Grewe of Morgoth took over as lead singer. Grewe had been a backing vocalist on the band's second and third albums. Marius Ickert of the band In Weak Lights was hired on bass. The band is recording what Worychta calls a rewrite of the album History of Hate.

Location The town of Artés is located at the center of Catalonia, at the eastern edge of the plain zone of Bages -commonly known as Pla de Bages. The town is in the basin of the Gavarresa river and of its affluent, the stream of Malrubí. It is bordered on the North by the towns of Sallent and Avinyó, in the South by Calders and it shares a small border in the West with Navarcles, on the limit of the Llobregat river. The town is near the Artés Formation, a unique geological formation that owes its name to its proximity with the town. History The name of Artés is believed to derive from the Latin word Artium , which means \\"fortified hill\\". This is based on the evidence of the existence of a 6th-century fortified church on the top of the hill of Artés, where the first settlers began to expand the village into the valley. Little evidence of the Prehistory of Artés has been discovered to date. However, a document from the year 938 indicates the presence of three dolmens; and abundant samples of Iberian pottery have been found in the valley of Salabernada. The archeological remains of the Classical Period are numerous and confirm the existence of continuous settlement for seven centuries. In particular, archeological finds have been made at Matacans, where there used to be a Roman villa, and at the Plaça Vella (Old Square) where three Roman inscriptions of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, one necropolis and an ancient Paleochristian Church -that can be dated between 6th and 7th centuries- were found. The name of Artés is one of the first documented names of all the towns in Bages. Specifically, a grant dated on 24 June 889, by which the King Odó gave to the Church of Sant Pere de Vic several goods and rights; among them de Valley of Artés. Economy At present, the most important activity of the town is industry, which counts on some important multinational companies established in the town. In 1973 the Industrial Zone of Santa Maria d'Artés was opened and in 1991 an important enlargement of it was made, even though it is now reaching its limit of usable ground. On the other hand, Artés is well known for its production of wine and cava. In 1996, together with other towns of the surrounding area, Artés achieved the Denomination of Origin Pla de Bages for its wines and, at the same time, it celebrated the tenth birthday of the denomination of the Cava of Artés.

Mayne sailed with Captain George Henry Richards on his expedition in HMS Plumper and also on HMS Hecate to survey the coast of British Columbia (1857–1859), and there came to serve in the Royal Engineers under Colonel Richard Moody and was assigned the exploration and mapping of hitherto unknown parts of the colony. His journal of these activities is a classic source of British Columbia history, as are those of his Royal Engineer colleague Lieutenant Henry Spencer Palmer. Mayne Island in the Gulf Islands is named after him, and Hecate Strait for his vessel. For this work, in 1860, he was promoted to Commander and returned to England.Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. xxxi, p.297, and vol. xxxii, p123 In 1862 he was appointed to the command of HMS Eclipse, for service in New Zealand, and took part in the New Zealand Wars until severely wounded in 1863 and invalided home.

Charles Darwin requested the Lords of the Admiralty to ask Capt. Mayne to collect several boatloads of fossil bones of extinct species of quadrupeds. Admiral Sulivan had previously discovered an astonishingly rich accumulation of fossil bones not far from the Straits. These remains apparently belonged to a more ancient period, than the collection by Mr Darwin on HMS Beagle and by other naturalists and therefore of great interest to science. Many of these were collected with the aid of Hydrographer Capt. Richards R.N. and deposited in the British Museum.Letter from B.J. Sulivan, 27 June 1866 and nn. 6 and 7 in the Darwin Letters. See:, The Admiralty compiled advice to mariners of the Strait in 1871. Admiral Mayne was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and served on its Council. He was the author of Four years in British Columbia and Vancouver Island.NB in the context of that title the name \\"Vancouver\\" references the Colony of Vancouver Island, as the modern city of Vancouver had not yet been founded or named at the time of publication. Likewise the name \\"British Columbia\\" references the Colony of British Columbia, which was not yet united with Vancouver Island as a single colony. Marriage In 1870 Captain Mayne married Miss Sabine Dent, a daughter of Sir Thomas Dent (1796–1872), founder of Dent & Co., Hong Kong, and his wife, Sabine Ellen Robarts, daughter of James Thomas Robarts (1784–1825), another influential opium merchant. Sabine Dent was the niece of Lancelot Dent, of Flass House. After his marriage he only served a short term afloat in command of HMS Invincible. He retired as a Rear-Admiral in 1879. Political career After retiring from the Navy, he unsuccessfully contested the Welsh constituency of Pembroke and Haverfordwest as a Conservative at the 1885 general election, being defeated by a narrow margin by the Liberal candidate, H.G. Allen. In 1886, Allen was among the Liberal MPs who broke with Gladstone over Irish Home Rule. Shortly after the election was announced, Mayne arrived in the constituency launch his campaign. At a meeting at the Masonic Hall in Pembroke, he emphasised that he had consulted with Allen before travelling to the constituency and stated that he had a letter in his possession from Allen confirming his decision to retire. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) there the following year, serving until his death shortly before the 1892 general election.Historical list of MPs: P, at Leigh Rayment's Peerage pages References =Citations= =Bibliography= * Category:1835 births Category:1892 deaths Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for Welsh constituencies Category:Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery Category:Explorers of British Columbia Category:Pre-Confederation British Columbia people Category:Irish emigrants to pre-Confederation British Columbia Category:People from County Fermanagh Category:People from County Cavan Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Pembrokeshire constituencies Category:UK MPs 1886–1892 Category:Royal Navy admirals Category:Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Irish explorers of North America Category:19th-century Anglo-Irish people ","title":"Richard Mayne (explorer)"},{"id":"10758309","text":"Ivan Belošević (12 September 1909 – 7 October 1987), nicknamed Ivica, was a Croatian footballer.

A runway incursion is an incident where an unauthorized aircraft, vehicle, or person is on a runway or runway protected area. Under some interpretations, a runway incursion also exists when an aircraft crosses into an ILS protected area or approach protected area when active. Any such incursion adversely affects runway safety, as it creates the risk that an airplane taking off or landing will collide with the object, distract the non- infringing flight crew, or interfere with navigational signals such as the glideslope or localizer. \\"Runway Incursion\\" is defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on April 27, 2006, as: > Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an > aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated > for the landing and takeoff of aircraft. In October 2007, the Federal Aviation Administration dropped its own definition of \\"runway incursion\\" and adopted the above. The difference between the two was \\"that ICAO defines a runway incursion as any unauthorized intrusion onto a runway, regardless of whether or not an aircraft presents a potential conflict. For the FAA, an incident without an aircraft in potential conflict– such as an unauthorized aircraft crossing an empty runway– was defined as a 'surface incident' and not a runway incursion.\\" There are 3 types of runway incursions with 4 levels of severity that the FAA uses to classify incidents. Operational Incidents - Action of an air traffic controller that results in less than required minimum separation between two or more aircraft, or between an aircraft and obstacles (vehicles, equipment, personnel) on runways or clearing an aircraft to takeoff or land on a closed runway. Pilot Deviations - Action of a pilot that violates any Federal Aviation Regulation, example: a pilot crosses a runway without a clearance while en route to an airport gate. Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviations - Pedestrians or vehicles entering any portion of the airport movement areas (runways/taxiways) without authorization from air traffic control. The 4 levels of severity are as follows: Category D - Incident that meets the definition of runway incursion such as incorrect presence of a single vehicle/person/aircraft on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and takeoff of aircraft but with no immediate safety consequences. Category C - An incident characterized by ample time and/or distance to avoid a collision. Category B - An incident in which separation decreases and there is a significant potential for collision, which may result in a time critical corrective/evasive response to avoid a collision. Category A - A serious incident in which a collision was narrowly avoided. Accident - An incursion that resulted in a collision. The Airport Surface Detection Equipment, Model X (ASDE-X) and the Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS) are computerized systems that are intended to alert air traffic controllers to the potential for a runway incursion.  Serious and fatal runway incursions  Audio of the 1 April 1999 runway incursion at Chicago O'Hare International Airport *Tenerife airport disaster – On March 27, 1977, two Boeing 747 passenger jets, KLM Flight 4805 and Pan Am Flight 1736, collided on the runway at Los Rodeos Airport (now Tenerife North Airport), on the Spanish island of Tenerife, Canary Islands, killing 583 people, making it the deadliest accident in aviation history. *Aeroflot Flight 3352 – On October 11, 1984, a Tupolev Tu-154B-1 hit maintenance vehicles on the runway while attempting to land in Omsk, Russia. The ground controller allowed maintenance workers to dry the runway during heavy rain and fell asleep on the job. 174 people aboard the aircraft were killed, along with 4 workers on the ground. This incursion is the deadliest aviation accident in Russian territory. *In the 1972 Chicago–O'Hare runway collision, North Central Airlines Flight 575 (a McDonnell Douglas DC-9) collided during its takeoff roll with Delta Air Lines Flight 954 (a Convair CV-880) while the CV-880 was taxiing across a fog- shrouded runway at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, killing 10 people and injuring 17. *In New Zealand, during the 1981 Springbok Tour, a number of protesters blocked the runway at Wellington Airport, forcing an Air New Zealand Fokker Friendship to abort its landing, another F27 to circle the airport for several minutes and delaying two departures. *USAir Flight 1493 was a scheduled passenger flight from Syracuse Hancock International Airport, New York, to San Francisco International Airport, via Washington, D.C.; Columbus, Ohio; and Los Angeles. On the evening of February 1, 1991, the Boeing 737-300 serving the flight accidentally collided with SkyWest Flight 5569, a Metroliner turboprop aircraft, upon landing at Los Angeles. *1994 TWA Flight 427/Superior Aviation Cessna 441 Conquest II, 22 November 1994: Cessna pilot error at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. Pilot taxied to incorrect runway and was struck by departing TWA MD-80, 2 fatalities on the Cessna. *On 16 November 1996, United Express Flight 5925 was landing at Quincy Regional Airport when the pilot of a Beechcraft King Air started to takeoff on an intersecting runway. As the field was uncontrolled, the United Express pilots inquired whether the King Air was clear of the runways. They received no response except for a call from a Piper Cherokee saying they were holding short. The King Air and United Express collided at the intersection of the two runways killing all 12 on board Flight 5925 and the pilot and passenger of the Beechcraft King Air. *On 1 April 1999, an Air China Boeing 747, Flight 9018, taxied onto an active runway at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport during the takeoff of Korean Air Flight 36, another 747. Flight 36 averted a collision by taking off early, missing the Air China aircraft by . There were 8 people on the Air China jet, and 379 on the South Korean flight. *1999 T. F. Green Airport runway incursion, 6 December 1999: In low visibility at night, a United Airlines 757 turned down the wrong taxiway and taxied onto the active runway just as a FedEx Express 727 took off. No collision occurred. *On 25 May 2000, at Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 operating as Air Liberte Flight 8807 collided with a Shorts 330-200 with its left wing while taking off. One of the pilots in the Shorts 330-200 was killed; the other pilot was seriously injured. The MD-83 aborted takeoff at a speed of 155 knots. There were no injuries to the 151 passengers and 6 crew members on the MD-83. The MD-83 sustained substantial damage to its left wing but was later repaired. An investigation concluded that the runway incursion was caused by ATC error. *Linate Airport disaster, 8 October 2001: Scandinavian flight 686 collided on takeoff with a Cessna Citation registered D-IEVX that had turned onto the wrong taxiway, causing it to enter the runway. *2004 Indian Ocean tsunami aftermath, Banda Aceh 4 January 2005: water buffalo on runway caused ground collision which seriously delayed relief flights. *On 9 June 2005, US Airways Flight 1170, a Boeing 737-300, nearly collided with Aer Lingus Flight 132, an Airbus A330 at Logan International Airport in Boston after both flights were given nearly simultaneous clearances for takeoff on intersecting runways. The US Airways flight kept its nose down on the runway for an extended amount of time to go underneath the Aer Lingus flight and avoided a collision. *On 20 October 2014, a Dassault Falcon 50 collided on takeoff with a snow plow that had strayed onto the runway at Moscow Vnukovo Airport, killing Total oil company Chairman and CEO Christophe de Margerie. *On 11 October 2016, China Eastern Airlines Flight MU5643, an Airbus A320 (Registration B-2337), nearly collided with Flight MU5106 of the same airline, an Airbus A330 at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport in Shanghai, China, when the former was taking off on runway 36L while the latter was crossing the same runway under wrong instruction. The former performed a TOGA takeoff, managed to climb over the latter and avoided a collision. *On 13 February 2017, an Aviat Husky piloted by actor Harrison Ford, landed on Taxiway C at John Wayne Airport instead of Runway 20L barely missing an American 737 waiting to takeoff. No one was hurt in the incident. * On 7 May 2020, an adult male intruder entered the grounds of Austin–Bergstrom International Airport, being struck and killed by a Boeing 737-7H4 operating Southwest Airlines Flight 1392 as it landed at the airport. There were no injuries or fatalities to the 58 people on board the aircraft, although substantial damage was sustained to the 737's left engine nacelle.

The oldest member, Buster Martin, claimed to have been born in 1906, although some sources indicate he was born in 1913. Martin died in 2011. Former lead singer Alf Carretta died on 29 June 2010, aged 93. The group takes its name from the Zimmer frame, the UK term for a mobility aid known in other countries as a walker. The band was created as a feature in a BBC Television documentary which aired on 28 May 2007. The feature of forming the band and recording a single was intended to give a voice to the feelings of isolation and imprisonment suffered by the elderly. The Zimmers' logo is a parody of The Beatles' logo, as is the image of them walking across Abbey Road. On 7 April 2012, the band performed the Beastie Boys' \\"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)\\" on Britain's Got Talent. The band toured in 2013, performing in Warrington on 25 May that year. Discography The Zimmers released their first single, a cover of The Who's \\"My Generation\\", reaching #26 in the UK Singles Chart, on 28 May 2007. The song was produced by Mike Hedges, the video shot by Geoff Wonfor, and it was recorded in the Beatles Studio 2 at Abbey Road. On during the 13 July 2007 broadcast of the Richard & Judy show, The Zimmers announced their cover of The Prodigy's \\"Firestarter\\". In September 2008, the band released their first full-length album Lust for Life, which featured versions of songs by Eric Clapton, The Beatles and Frank Sinatra. BBC documentary Documentary-maker Tim Samuels travelled Britain, investigating the feelings of isolation and imprisonment suffered by the country's elderly, as part of the BBC's Power to the People series. Samuels recruits pensioners otherwise stuck in institutions and towerblocks, and they air their grievances, culminating in the recording of the group's first single, where the group \\"sticks it back to the society that has cast them aside\\". Britain's Got Talent 15 members of the band, aged 66 to 88, appeared on Britain's Got Talent on 7 April 2012, performing the Beastie Boys' track \\"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)\\". They walked on stage with thick coats and anoraks. Their oldest member, 88-year-old Grace Cooke, started the audition by singing a slow version of \\"What the World Needs Now\\". They all then removed their coats, revealing ostentatious jewellery (described as 'bling' by one the judges) and hoodies and began to sing the Beasties track.

The show was hosted by Dennis Miller at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The show centered on The Smashing Pumpkins, who led the pack that night with nine nominations. Having lost their touring keyboardist days before this appearance to a heroin overdose, and kicked longtime, original drummer Jimmy Chamberlin out of the band, the band opened the show as a three-piece, performing an awe-inspiring, emotional version of \\"Tonight, Tonight.\\" What is more, the Pumpkins ended up winning seven of the awards they were up for: \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" earned six wins out of its eight nominations, including Video of the Year, thus making it the night's most nominated and biggest winning video; while their video for \\"1979\\" earned the one Moonman it was nominated for: Best Alternative Video. The next biggest nominee and winner that night was Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, who won three out of her six nominations for her video \\"Ironic.\\" Tying with her in terms of nominations was Icelandic singer Björk, who also received six; however, her video for \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\" only took home one Moonman for Best Choreography. Closely following with five nominations each were Coolio, the Foo Fighters, and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Out of these, though, only the former two ended up taking home some Moonmen for their videos. Coolio won three, as \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\" won two out of its three nominations, and \\"1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)\\" won one out of its two nominations, while the Foo Fighters' \\"Big Me\\" took home one Moonman for Best Group Video. Bone Thugs-n- Harmony, meanwhile, went home empty-handed. Highlights of the show included a pre-show set by little-but-soon-to-be-widely known No Doubt, who performed on the entrance marquee of Radio City Music Hall. There was also a short-lived reunion of the four original members of Van Halen, who had not appeared together at that time for more than a decade, presenting the award for Best Male Video, as well as a live interlink with astronauts on the Mir space station. The show also marked Tupac Shakur's final public appearance before being shot four times in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada three days later on September 7, dying of his wounds on September 13.

Younger (c. 1898 – August 6, 1942) was the American United States Army soldier selected to choose the body to become America's Unknown Soldier representing all of those who were lost by the United States during World War I. Edward Younger died of a heart attack in Chicago, Illinois, on August 6, 1942. He was a long time employee of the Post Office in Chicago and was 44 years old. National officers of the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars accompanied the coffin to the cemetery. Younger enlisted in the Army in February 1917 and took part, as an Infantry Sergeant, in major engagements, including at Chateau-Thierry, St. Mihiel, the Somme Offensive and the Meuse- Argonne Offensive. He was wounded twice then re-enlisted in 1919 and was stationed with the 15th Infantry, Army of Occupation, Mayen, Germany, when Washington officials named him as one of six soldiers to go to France to select the Unknown Soldier. On Memorial Day 1921, four unknowns (U.S. soldiers killed in combat who were not identifiable) were exhumed from four World War I American cemeteries in France. U.S. Army sergeant Edward F. Younger, who had been wounded twice in combat, receiving the Purple Heart, and highly decorated for valor having received the Distinguished Service Cross during the First World War, selected the Unknown Soldier of World War I from four identical caskets at the City Hall in Châlons-en-Champagne, France, on October 24, 1921. Sgt. Younger selected the unknown by placing a spray of white roses on one of the caskets. He chose the third casket from the left. The chosen unknown soldier was transported to the United States aboard USS Olympia. The other remains were interred in the Meuse Argonne Cemetery, France. For many years Younger spoke publicly about the event. In his own words, as he told the story to civic and veterans groups, in an average of one a week from the time, this is what happened: \\"At first it was an idea that we (the six soldiers) were to be just pallbearers, but when we lined up in the little makeshift chapel, Major Harbold, the officer in charge of grave registrations, told us, 'One of you men is to be given the honor of selecting the body of the Unknown Soldier.' He had a large bouquet of pink and white roses in his arms. He finally handed the roses to me. I was left alone in the chapel. There were four coffins, all unnamed and unmarked. The one that I placed the roses on was the one brought home and placed in the national shrine. I walked around the coffins three times, then suddenly I stopped. What caused me to stop, I don't know, it was as though something had pulled me. I placed the roses on the coffin in front of me. I can still remember the awed feeling that I had, standing there alone.\\" Younger, who was from Chicago, Illinois, completed his service with the Army in 1922 then began working for the U.S. Postal Service. He was interred in Section 18 of Arlington National Cemetery beside his wife, Agnes Anna Younger. See also * Maria Bergamas, the Italian mother that chose a body for the unknown soldier of Italy.

One of the most importants acts by the club was the building of a stadium on Tratinska cesta (today's Stadion u Kranjčevićevoj), then the biggest in Zagreb. It was finished in 1921. The Yugoslavia national football team played eleven matches at the club's grounds. Apart from football, the club also competed in athletics, skiing, field hockey and table tennis. The club's most famous footballers were: Pavelić, Babić, Ivan Belošević, Jazbec, Monsider, Pavletić, Aleksandar Živković, Kodrnja and Karlo Muradori.

It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system. History In 1900, the Seventh-day Adventist Church created an elementary school in Phoenix. It expanded to include an intermediate school after several years. The need for an academy was becoming clear as more Seventh-day Adventists moved to Arizona. Finally, in 1920, Arizona Academy opened in northeast Phoenix with two dormitories and classes taught on the lower levels. In 1953, the Seventh-day Adventist Church bought Thunderbird Field#2, an Army air base that included almost 600 acres of land, from the federal government. The school, now under its current name, moved to the former air base, and up until the 1970s and construction of new facilities, the school used the old Army buildings on site. Former hangars became a wood products industry and a vocational education center offering woodworking, welding and mechanics training, while the field itself was used to train missionary pilots. In 1963, to finance renovations, TAA commissioned an industrial park to surround the airport. In 1966, the city of Scottsdale bought the airfield. Academics Academics offered at TAA range from entry level classes to Advanced Placement in math, science, and English. Thunderbird Academy offeres two types of diplomas, a standard and a college preparatory diploma. The requirements for the latter are more stringent; a student must complete three or four years of mathematics and three or four years of science. Students who have a cumulative GPA of 3.5 to 3.75 will graduate with honors; those who have a GPA of 3.75 or higher will graduate with high honors. TAA is accredited through the Western Association of Schools & Colleges and the Adventist Accrediting Association. Spiritual aspects All students take religion classes each year. These classes cover topics in biblical history and Christian and denominational doctrines. Instructors in other disciplines begin each class period with prayer or a short devotional thought, many of which encourage student input. The entire student body gathers together each week in the auditorium for an hour-long chapel service. Outside the classrooms there is year-round spiritually oriented programming that relies on student involvement. Athletics All students in grades 9-12 are required to take three years of physical education classes. The high school is a full member of the Arizona Interscholastic Association. The school fields varsity teams in track and field, cross country, baseball, softball, basketball (boys and girls), boys' fall soccer, and volleyball (boys and girls), and co-ed varsity tennis. They also have the Wings Acrobatic Team. Campus ministries The school offers campus ministry services, such as on-campus Sabbath services; student-led Sabbath School classes; evangelism and mission trips; and ministry outreach.

The parent compound is labile, being highly sensitive toward even weak nucleophiles. Surrogates of cyclopropanone include the acetals.Datasheet commercial supplier Link Preparation Cyclopropanone has been prepared by reaction of ketene with diazomethane at −145 °C. Derivatives of cyclopropanone are of some interest to organic chemistry. Derivatives Cyclopropanones are intermediates in the Favorskii rearrangement with cyclic ketones where carboxylic acid formation is accompanied by ring-contraction. Cyclopropanones react as 1,3-dipoles in cycloadditions for instance with cyclic dienes such as furan. An oxyallyl intermediate or valence tautomer (formed by cleavage of the C2-C3 bond) is suggested as the active intermediate or even a biradical structure (compare to the related trimethylenemethane). :Cyclopropanone tautomeric structures Experimental evidence is not conclusive. Other reactions of cyclopropanones take place through this intermediate. For instance enantiopure (+)-trans-2,3-di-tert-butylcyclopropanone racemizes when heated to 80 °C. An oxyallyl intermediate is also proposed in the photochemical conversion of a 3,5-dihydro-4H-pyrazole-4-one with expulsion of nitrogen to an indane: :2,3-Dimethyl-2,3-diphenylcyclopropanone intermediate in photolysis In this reaction oxyallyl intermediate A, in chemical equilibrium with cyclopropanone B attacks the phenyl ring through its carbocation forming a transient 1,3-cyclohexadiene C (with UV trace similar to isotoluene) followed by rearomatization.

Although the Nazi party was promptly banned, Austria did not have the same thorough process of denazification that was imposed on Germany. Lacking outside pressure for political reform, factions of Austrian society tried for a long time to advance the view that the Anschluss was only an imposition of rule by Nazi Germany. Early history A map showing the provinces claimed by the Republic of German-Austria in 1918 The origins of National Socialism in Austria have been disputed and continues to be debated. Professor Andrew Gladding Whiteside regarded the emergence of an Austrian variant of National Socialism as the product of the German-Czech conflict of the multi-ethnic Austrian Empire and rejected the view that it was a precursor of German Nazism. In 1918, at the end of World War I, with the breakup of the multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire, and with the abolition of the Habsburg monarchy, there were three major political groups competing with one another in the young republic of Austria: the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SDAP), Christian Social Party (CS), and the nationalist Great German Union (Großdeutsche Vereinigung), which became the Greater German People's Party (Großdeutsche Volkspartei, or GVP) in 1920. At the time, smaller parties such as the Communist Party of Austria (Kommunistische Partei Österreichs, or KPÖ) and the Austrian National Socialists (Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei, or DNSAP) were neither present in the Reichsrat (Imperial Council) nor the Nationalrat (National Council). SDAP, GVP, and DNSAP were clearly, although for different reasons, in favour a union of German Austria with the German state, which was also a republic by that time (Weimar Republic). The CS also tended to favour the union, but differed at first on a different subject - they were split on the idea of continuing the monarchy instead of a republic. Whereas only the KPÖ decidedly spoke against the annexation in the course of the 1920s and 1930s, the monarchists originally spoke up against the annexation and later turned to favor it, after the Bavarian Soviet Republic had failed, and Germany had a conservative government. The Treaty of Saint-Germain, signed 10 September 1919 by Karl Renner (SDAP), first chancellor of the republic, clearly forbade any union with Germany, abolished the monarchy, and clearly stated the First Austrian Republic as an independent country. First Austrian Republic The First Austrian Republic angered many Austrian pan-Germans who made the claim that the republic violated the Fourteen Points that were announced by United States President Woodrow Wilson during peace talks, specifically the right to \\"self-determination\\" of all nations. Life and politics in the early years were marked by serious economic problems (the loss of industrial areas and natural resources in the now independent Czechoslovakia, hyperinflation) and a constantly increasing tension between the different political groups. From 1918 to 1920 the government was led by the Social Democratic Party and later by the Christian Social Party in coalition with the German nationalists. On 31 May 1922, prelate Ignaz Seipel became Chancellor of the Christian Social government. He succeeded in improving the economic situation with the financial help of the League of Nations (monetary reform). Ideologically, Seipel was clearly anti-communist and did everything in his power to reduce, as far as possible, the influence of the Social Democrats - both sides saw this as a conflict between two social classes. The military of Austria was restricted to 30,000 men by the allies and the police force was poorly equipped. Already by 1918 the first homeguards were established like the Kärntner Abwehrkampf. In 1920 in Tirol the first Heimwehr was put in duty under the command of Richard Steidle with the help of the Bavarian organisation Escherich. Soon other states followed. In 1923 members of the Monarchist \\"Ostara\\" shot a worker dead and the Social Democrats founded their own protective organization. Other paramilitary groups were the formed from former active soldiers and members of the Roman Catholic Church. The Vaterländische Schutzbund (Protectors of the Fatherland) were National Socialists. Later they started the Austrian Sturmabteilung (SA). The German Workers' Party had already been founded in Bohemia as early as 1903. It was then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It supported German nationalism and anti-clericalism, but at first was not particularly anti-Semitic. This party stood mainly for making Austria and the Austrian Germans a part of Germany. In 1909 lawyer, Walter Riehl joined the party and he became leader in 1918. Soon after that the name was changed to the German National Socialist Workers' Party (Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei; DNSAP). After the fall of the monarchy, the party split into a Czechoslovakian party and an Austrian party under Riehl. From 1920 onwards this Austrian party cooperated closely with the Munich formed German Workers' Party (DAP) and then the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), which Adolf Hitler led after 1921. In 1923 Riehl's party had about 23,000 members and was a marginal factor in Austrian politics. In 1924 there was another split and Karl Schulz led a splinter group. The two opposed each other. In 1926 Richard Suchenwirth founded the Austrian branch of Hitler's German National Socialist party in Vienna. Around that time Benito Mussolini formed his Fascist dictatorship in Italy and became an important ally of the far right. The Austrian National Socialists linked to Hitler (Nazis) got only 779 votes in the 1927 General Election. The strongest grouping besides the Social Democrats was the Unity Coalition led by the Christian Social Party but including German Nationalists and the groups of Riehl and Schulz. In the course of these years there were frequent serious acts of violence between the various armed factions and people were regularly killed. In the General Election of 1930, the Social Democrats were the largest single party. The Christian Social Party came second but stayed in office in a coalition with smaller parties. The Austrian National Socialists linked to Hitler's NSDAP received only 3.6% of the votes and failed to enter Parliament. In the following years the Nazis gained votes at the expense of the various German national groups, which also wanted unity with Germany. After 1930 Hitler's NSDAP doubled its membership every year because of the economic crisis. One of their slogans was, \\"500,000 Unemployed – 400,000 Jews – Simple way out; vote National Socialist\\". Dictatorship, civil war and banning the National Socialists Soldiers of the Austrian Federal Army in Vienna in 1934 The Christian Social Party had ruled from 1932 and Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß had led them from 1932. The Social Democrats were no longer their only threat. The previous chancellor and priest Ignaz Seipel had worked towards an authoritarian state. Seipel based this on the Papal Encyclicals, Rerum novarum (1891) and Quadragesimo anno (1931). Abolition of the parliamentary system was necessary for this. A crisis in the Austrian parliament on the 4 May 1933 gave Dollfuß the opportunity he wanted. Later in May 1933 the Christian Social Union was converted to the Patriotic Front. The Patriotic Front was a political organisation, supposedly above partisan considerations, Roman Catholic and vehemently anti-Marxist. It purported to represent all Austrians who were true to their native land. Within a week the Austrian Communist Party was banned, and before the end of the month the republican paramilitary organisation and Freethinkers Organisations were banned along with numerous other groups. Nazis failed to get more than 25% of the votes in local elections in most areas. In Zwettl and Innsbruck however they got more than 40%, and they tried to lever this into a basis for agitation against the ruling Patriotic Front. Nazi supporters generated a wave of terrorism which crested in early June with four deaths and 48 people injured. Austrian troops taking position in February 1934 In Germany Hitler became Chancellor early in 1933. The Social Democrats deleted any intention to cooperate with Germany from its party programme. Nazis had fled to Bavaria after their party was banned in Austria and founded there the Austrian Legion. The Nazis there had military style camps and military training. Nazi terrorists in Austria received financial, logistic and material support from Germany. The German Government subjected Austria to systematic agitation. After the expulsion of the Bavarian Minister of Justice in May 1933 German citizens were required to pay a thousand marks to the German Government before travelling to Austria. The Austrian Nazi Party was banned in June after a hand grenade attack in Krems. Nazi terrorism abated after that though five more people were killed and 52 injured by the end of the year. On 12 February 1934 there was a violent confrontation in Linz with serious consequences. Members of a paramilitary group acting to assist the police wanted to enter a building belonging to the Social Democrats or a party member's home. They wanted to find any weapons belonging to the Social Democrat paramilitary which had by then been banned. Violence spread to the whole country and developed into civil war. The police and their paramilitary supporters together with the army won the confrontation by the 14 February. There were many arrests. Constitutional courts were abolished, trade unions and the Social Democrat Party were banned, and the death penalty was reintroduced. After political opposition had been suppressed the Austrian Republic was transformed into the Austrofacist Ständestaat. The authoritarian Maiverfassung (May Constitution) was proclaimed on 1 May. =Attempted Nazi coup and growing German influence= From the start of 1934 there was a new wave of Nazi terrorist attacks in Austria. This time government institutions were targeted far more than individuals. In the first half of 1934, 17 people were killed and 171 injured. On 25 July the Nazis attempted a coup under the leadership of the Austrian SS. About 150 SS personnel forced their way into the Chancellor's office in Vienna. Dollfuß was shot and died a few hours later from his wounds. Another group occupied the building of the Austrian National Radio and forced a statement that the Government of Dollfuß had fallen and Anton Rintelen was the new head of government. Anton Rintelen belonged to the Christian Social Party but is suspected of Nazi sympathy. This false report was intended to start a Nazi uprising throughout the country but it was only partially successful. There was considerable fighting in parts of Carinthia, Styria and Upper Austria and limited resistance in Salzburg. In Carinthia and Styria the fighting lasted from the 27 to 30 July. Some members of the Austrian Legion tried to push out from Bavaria over the Mühlviertel, a part of Upper Austria, and towards Linz. They were forced back to the frontier at Kollerschlag. On 26 July a German courier was arrested at the Kollerschlag pass in Upper Austria. He had with him documented instructions for the revolt. This so-called Kollerschlag Document demonstrated the connection of the July revolt to Bavaria clearly. The army, the gendarmery and the police put down revolt with heavy casualties. On the government side there were 107 deaths and 500 injuries. On the rebel side there were 140 deaths and 600 injuries. 13 rebels were executed and 4,000 people were imprisoned without trial. Many thousand supporters of the Nazi party were arrested. Up to 4000 fled over the border to Germany and Yugoslavia. Kurt Schuschnigg became the new Chancellor. In Bavaria many sections of the Austrian legion were officially closed. In reality they were only pushed further north and renamed, “North-West Assistance”. Hitler ordered troops to the Austrian border, prepared for a full-scale military assault into Austria to support the National Socialists. Fascist Italy was more closely tied to the regime in Vienna and sent troops to the Austrian border at Brenner to deter German troops from a possible invasion of Austria. Hitler was at first torn between going ahead with the invasion, or pulling off the border. Hitler realized that the German Army was not prepared to take on both the Austrians and the Italian Army. Hitler ordered the force to be pulled off the Austrian border. The German government stated that it had nothing to do with the revolt. Germany only admitted that it was trying to subvert the Austrian political system through trusted people. They continued to support the illegal Nazi party but sympathizers who did not belong to the party were more significant. This included among others Taras Borodajkewycz, Edmund Glaise- Horstenau, Franz Langoth, Walther Pembauer and Arthur Seyß-Inquart. To put Schuschnigg's mind at ease, Hitler declared to the Reichstag in May 1935: \\"Germany neither intends nor wishes to interfere in the internal affairs of Austria, to annex Austria or to conclude an Anschluss.\\" Italy began its conquest of Abyssinia (the Second Italo-Abyssinian War) in October 1935. After that Mussolini was internationally isolated and strengthened his relations with Hitler. The ruling Austrian Patriotic Front lost an important ally. Despite the murder of Engelbert Dollfuß, his successor Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg had to improve relations with the German government. Like his predecessor he wanted to maintain the independence of Austria. He saw Austria as the second German state and the better state as it was founded on Roman Catholicism. In July 1936 Schuschnigg accepted the July Agreement with Germany. Imprisoned Nazis were released and some Nazi newspapers, which had been banned, were allowed into Austria. The Nazi Party remained banned. Schuschnigg undertook further to allow two people whom the Nazis trusted into the Government. Edmund Glaise-Horstenau became Minister for National Affairs and Guido Schmidt became Secretary of State in the Foreign Ministry. Arthur Seyß-Inquart was taken into the legislative Council of State. Germany rescinded the requirement for a payment of a thousand marks for entry into Austria. The transformation of the Austrofascist State through Nazis was furthered more in 1937 when it became possible for them to join the Patriotic Front. Throughout Austria political units were set up and some were led by Nazis. This was a legal disguise for the reorganization. The native Austrian- born Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf on the first page of the book: \\"German Austria must return to the great German motherland\\" and \\"common blood belongs in a common Reich\\". From 1937 it was clear to the Nazis that it would not be long before Austria was going to be part of the Third Reich. His strategy, outlined in the Hossbach Memorandum, included the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland part of Czechoslovakia to gain Lebensraum (\\"living space\\"). Hitler told Goebbels in the late summer that Austria would sooner or later be taken \\"by force\\". In February 1938 Franz von Papen, the German ambassador in Vienna arranged a meeting between Hitler and Schuschnigg at Obersalzberg in Gaden in Bavaria. Hitler threatened repeatedly to invade Austria and forced Schuschnigg to implement a range of measures favourable to Austrian Nazism. The Agreement of Gaden guaranteed the Austrian Nazi Party political freedom and assisted Arthur Seyß-Inquart in becoming Home Secretary (Innenminister). Schuschnigg endeavoured to maintain Austrian national integrity despite steadily increasing German influence. On 9 March 1938 he announced that he wanted to hold a consultative referendum on the independence of Austria on the following Sunday. Hitler responded by mobilizing the 8th Army for the planned invasion. Edmund Glaise-Horstenau who was at the time in Berlin brought Hitler's ultimatum from there and Göring reinforced it with a telephone message to Schuschnigg. The German government demanded the postponement or abandonment of the referendum. Schuschnigg conceded on the afternoon of 11 March. Then Hitler demanded his resignation which happened on the same evening. Annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany Adolf Hitler announcing the Anschluss on 15 March 1938 Thousands of Austrians gathering to hear Hitler's proclamation of the Anschluss The \\"Stairs of Death\\" at Mauthausen-Gusen, where prisoners were forced to carry a granite block up 186 steps to the top of the quarry After Schuschnigg left office, the federal president Wilhelm Miklas asked Arthur Seyß-Inquart to form a new government as the Germans demanded. From 11 to 13 March he led the Austrian Government and completed the Anschluss. On the morning of 12 March heavily armed German troops and police crossed the Austrian frontier, in total about 25000. Large sections of the Austrian population were very pleased to see them. In Vienna, Aspern met Heinrich Himmler of the SS accompanied by many police and SS officials to take over the Austrian police. Supporters of the Austrian Nazi Party together with members of the SS and SA occupied public buildings and offices throughout Austria without a previously planned transition period. The formation of the Greater German Reich was announced from the balcony of the Council House in Linz. On the following day, 13 March 1938, the second session of the Government passed the “Reunification with Germany Law”. Federal President Miklas refused to endorse it and resigned. Seyß-Inquart was now functioning Head of State. He could make his own laws and publish them. Before the evening was over, Hitler signed a law which made Austria a German province. On 15 March Hitler, who had spent the previous two days in his birth town of Braunau am Inn, made a triumphal entry into Vienna and gave a speech on Heldenplatz in front of tens of thousands of cheering people, in which he boasted of his \\"greatest accomplishment\\": \\"As leader and chancellor of the German nation and Reich I announce to German history now the entry of my homeland into the German Reich.\\"In German: \\"\\" Ernst Kaltenbrunner from Upper Austria, sentenced to death in 1946 at the Nuremberg trials, was promoted SS-Brigadeführer and the leader of the SS-upper section Austria. Beginning on 12 March and during the subsequent weeks 72,000 people were arrested, primarily in Vienna, among them politicians of the First Republic, intellectuals and above all Jews. Jewish institutions were shuttered. Josef Bürckel, previously Reichskommissar for the reunion of the Saar (protectorate), was appointed by Hitler to reorganize the Nazi Party in Austria and on 13 March as \\"Reichskommissar for the reunification of Austria with the German Empire\\". In March 1938 the local Gauleiter of Gmunden, Upper Austria, gave a speech to the local Austrians and told them that the \\"traitors\\" of Austria were to be thrown into the newly opened Mauthausen concentration camp. Overall 200,000 people were killed at the camp. The Anti-Romanyism sentiment of Nazi Germany was implemented initially most harshly in newly annexed Austria when between 1938-1939 the Nazis arrested around 2,000 Gypsy men whom were sent to Dachau and 1,000 Gypsy women whom were sent to Ravensbrück. In late October 1939, all Austrian Gypsies were required to register themselves. Between 1938-39 the Nazis carried out racial examinations against the Gypsy population. Until 1941 the Nazis made a distinction between \\"pure Gypsies\\" and \\"Gypsy Mischlinge\\". However, Nazi racial research concluded that 90% of Gypsies were of mixed ancestry. Thus, after 1942, the Nazis discriminated against the Gypsies on the same level as the Jews with a variety of discrimination laws. Plebiscite Referendum ballot, set to make people vote for \\"Yes\\" A referendum to ratify the annexation was set for 10 April, preceded by major propaganda campaign. Hitler himself, Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Göring, Rudolf Hess, and many other leading figures of the Nazi regime held speeches. The controlled press and radio campaign for a Yes vote to the \\"Reunion of Germany and Austria\\". Prominent Austrians like Cardinal Theodor Innitzer, who signed a declaration of the bishops with Heil Hitler, and the Social Democrat Karl Renner promoted the approval. Austria's bishops endorsed the Anschluss.History vs. Apologetics: The Holocaust, the Third Reich, and the Catholic Church By David Cymet, Lexington Books (2012) p.113 In response to a request from the Nazi government, the day before the referendum, all the churches in Austria tolled their bells in support of Hitler.History vs. Apologetics: The Holocaust, the Third Reich, and the Catholic Church By David Cymet, Lexington Books (2012) p.113 According to official records 99.73% voted Yes in Austria and in Germany 99.08% voted for the annexation. Excluded from the referendum were about 8% of the Austrian voters: about 200,000 Jews and roughly 177,000 Mischlinge (people with both Jewish and \\"Aryan\\" parents) and all those who had already been arrested for \\"racial\\" or political reasons. Antisemitism Civilians and uniformed personnel watching as Jews are forced to clean sidewalks The antisemitism against Austrian Jews had a long history in Austria. Mass antisemitic violence took place immediately after the Germans had crossed the border into Austria. On the day after the plebiscite, a British correspondent estimated that 100,000 Viennese were rampaging through the Jewish quarter shouting \\"Death to the Jews!\\"History vs. Apologetics: The Holocaust, the Third Reich, and the Catholic Church By David Cymet, Lexington Books (2012) p.114 In the wealthy district of Währing Jewish women were ordered to put on their fur coats and scrub the streets while officials urinated on them, as crowds of Austrians and Germans cheered.History vs. Apologetics: The Holocaust, the Third Reich, and the Catholic Church By David Cymet, Lexington Books (2012) p.114 The process of Aryanization began straight away, about 1,700 motor vehicles were seized from their Jewish owners between 11 March and 10 August 1938. Until May 1939, the government seized about 44,000 apartments in Jewish possession. Many were dispossessed of their shops and apartments, into which those who had robbed them moved, assisted by the SA and fanatics. Jews were forced to put on their best clothes and, on their hands and knees with brushes, to clean the sidewalks of anti-Anschluss slogans. The Kristallnacht (\\"Night of Broken Glass\\") pogroms of November 1938 were especially brutal in Austria; most of Vienna's synagogues were burned in view of the public and fire departments.https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/austria Anti-Semitism was widespread even in the highest government offices. As with Karl Renner. The politician whom Emperor Karl I rejected as prime minister, who became chancellor after 1918, welcomed Austria's annexation to the German Reich in 1938 and was again at the head of the state after 1945, stood out before and after the war due to anti-Semitism. Even after the Nazi terror regarding Jewish returnees and concentration camp survivors. Marko Feingold, survivor of the concentration camp and president of the Salzburg Jewish Community, stated in 2013: \\"Karl Renner, after all the first Federal President of the Second Republic, had long been known in the party as an anti-Semite. He didn't want us concentration campers in Vienna after the war and he also frankly said that Austria would not give anything back to them.\\" Interview with Marko Feingold 2013Maximilian Gottschlich \\"Die große Abneigung.

Even today in a united Europe and after a precise scientific analysis of the Nazi crimes, there are still countless streets in Austria named after Dr. Karl Renner, and Karl Renner is defended in large numbers. Even today the state awards a Karl Renner Prize.Oliver Rathkolb \\"Die paradoxe Republik.

Austrian contribution to Nazi Germany's armed forces Prior to the Anschluss the Austrian Nazi party's military wing, the Austrian SS, was active terrorist organization. After the Anschluss, Hitler's Austrian and German armies were fully integrated. During the war, 800,000 Austrians fought for Nazi Germany in the Wehrmacht and a further 150,000 Austrians joined up to the Nazi party's military wing, known as the Waffen-SS.History vs. Apologetics: The Holocaust, the Third Reich, and the Catholic Church By David Cymet, Lexington Books (2012) p.113 Concentration camps and mass murder The majority of the bureaucrats who implemented the Final Solution were Austrian.History vs. Apologetics: The Holocaust, the Third Reich, and the Catholic Church By David Cymet, Lexington Books (2012) p.114 Political scientist David Art of Tufts University notes that Austrians comprised 8 per cent of the Third Reich's population and 13 percent of the SS; he states that 40 per cent of the staff and 75 per cent of commanders at death camps were Austrian.Art, David (2006). The Politics of the Nazi Past in Germany and Austria. Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press. . The largest concentration camp in Austria was the Mauthausen-Gusen complex, with more than 50 subcamps, among them the Ebensee concentration camp, KZ – Nebenlager Bretstein, Steyr-Münichholz subcamp and AFA-Werke. Mass murder was practised in Hartheim Castle near Linz, where the killing programme Action T4 (involuntary euthanasia) took place, and in Am Spiegelgrund clinic in Vienna, where more than 700 handicapped children were murdered. Prominent Austrians in the Nazi regime The following Austrians were among those playing an active part in the Nazi regime: * Adolf Hitler was German Chancellor from 1933 to 1945 and Führer (\\"Leader\\") from 2 August 1934 to 30 April 1945. * Ernst Kaltenbrunner replaced Heydrich in January 1943 as leader of Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA). * Arthur Seyß- Inquart organized or covered several Nazi crimes in the Netherlands. * Odilo Globocnik was SS and police leader from 1939 in Poland where he supervised the building of the four Nazi extermination camps in Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka and Majdanek. He was one of the main people responsible for murdering about 2 million Polish Jews (\\"Aktion Reinhardt\\"). * Franz Josef Huber, appointed chief of the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police; SiPo) and Gestapo for Vienna, the \\"Lower Danube\\" and \\"Upper Danube\\" regions. * August Eigruber, Gauleiter of Upper Austria. * Alexander Löhr, commander of Luftflotte 4, carried out the bombing of Belgrade in April 1941. * Hermann Neubacher was an Austrian Nazi politician who held a number of diplomatic posts in the Third Reich. During the Second World War, he was appointed as the leading German foreign ministry official for Greece and the Balkans (including Serbia, Albania and Montenegro). * Lothar Rendulic was an army group commander in the Wehrmacht during World War II. Rendulic was one of three Austrians who rose to the rank of Generaloberst (colonel general) in the German armed forces. The other two were Alexander Löhr and Erhard Raus. * Wolfgang Abel, professor of racial biology at the University of Berlin, was involved in compulsory sterilization of so-called Rhineland Bastards. During the war, he carried out racial analyses on 7,000 Soviet prisoners of war on behalf of the high command of the army. * Heinrich Gross wrote expertises about \\"unworthy lives\\" and carried out deadly experiments at Am Spiegelgrund with handicapped children. * Alois Brunner was an Austrian Schutzstaffel (SS) officer who worked as Adolf Eichmann's assistant. * Karl Silberbauer arrested Anne Frank in 1944. * Edmund Glaise-Horstenau was an Austrian officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, last Vice-Chancellor of Austria before the 1938 Anschluss, a military historian, archivist, and general in the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War. * The Austrian gauleiters Hugo Jury, Franz Hofer and Friedrich Rainer also participated in Nazi crimes. Austrian resistance The Austrian resistance groups were often ideologically separated and reflected the spectrum of political parties before the war. In addition to armed resistance groups, there was a strong communist resistance group, groups close to the Catholic Church, Habsburg groups and individual resistance groups in the German Wehrmacht. Most resistance groups were exposed by the Gestapo and the members were executed. The most spectacular individual group of the Austrian resistance was the one around the priest Heinrich Maier. On the one hand, this very successful Catholic resistance group wanted to revive a Habsburg monarchy after the war (- as planned by Winston Churchill and later fought by Joseph Stalin) and very successfully passed on plans and production facilities for V-2 rockets, Tiger tanks and aircraft (Messerschmitt Bf 109, Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet, etc.) to the Allies. With the location sketches of the production facilities, the Allied bombers were able to carry out precise air strikes and thus protect residential areas. In contrast to many other German resistance groups, the Maier group informed very early about the mass murder of Jews through its contacts with the Semperit factory near Auschwitz.Elisabeth Boeckl-Klamper, Thomas Mang, Wolfgang Neugebauer: Gestapo-Leitstelle Wien 1938–1945.

A sign of the Austrian resistance was O5, where the 5 stands for E and OE is the abbreviation of Österreich with Ö as OE. This sign may be seen at the Stephansdom in Vienna. Austrians in exile From March to November 1938, 130,000 people managed to escape legally or illegally from Austria. Among the most famous emigrating artists, there were the composers Arnold Schönberg and Robert Stolz, the film-makers Leon Askin, Fritz Lang, Josef von Sternberg, Billy Wilder, Max Reinhardt, the actors Karl Farkas and Gerhard Bronner and the writers Hermann Broch, Robert Musil, Anton Kuh and Franz Werfel. Friedrich Torberg, who witnessed the German invasion (\\"Anschluss\\") in Prague, did not return to Vienna. Erich Fried flew with his mother to London after his father had been killed by the Gestapo in May 1938 during an interrogation. Stefan Zweig escaped via London, New York, Argentina and Paraguay to Brazil where he committed suicide in February 1942, together with his wife Charlotte Altmann. 1936 Nobel laureate in medicine Otto Loewi had to pay his prize money back before emigrating. Additional scientists going into exile were Sigmund Freud, Erwin Schrödinger, Kurt Gödel, Martin Buber, Karl Popper and Lise Meitner. Bruno Kreisky, who had to leave the country for political reasons and because of his Jewish origin, emigrated to Sweden. After his comeback, he served as Austrian Chancellor from 1970 to 1983. Aftermath \\"Austria – the Nazis' first victim\\" was a political slogan first used at the Moscow Conference in 1943 which went on to become the ideological basis for Austria and the national self-consciousness of Austrians during the periods of the allied occupation of 1945-1955 and the sovereign state of the Second Austrian Republic (1955–1980s). According to the interpretation of this slogan by the founders of the Second Austrian Republic, the Anschluss in 1938 was an act of military aggression by the Third Reich. Austrian statehood had been interrupted and therefore the newly revived Austria of 1945 could not and should not be responsible in any way for the Nazis' crimes. The \\"victim theory\\" formed by 1949 () insisted that all the Austrians, including those who strongly supported Hitler, had been unwilling victims of a Nazi regime and therefore were not responsible for its crimes. The \\"victim theory\\" became a fundamental myth of Austrian society. It made it possible for previously bitter political opponents – i.e. the social democrats and the conservative Catholics – to unite and to bring former Nazis back to the social and political life for the first time in Austrian history. For almost half a century, the Austrian state denied any continuity of the political regime of 1938–1945, actively kept up the self-sacrificing myth of Austrian nationhood, and cultivated a conservative spirit of national unity. Postwar denazification was quickly wound up; veterans of the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS took an honorable place in society. The struggle for justice by the actual victims of Nazism – first of all Jews – were deprecated as an attempt to obtain illicit enrichment at the expense of the entire nation. In 1986, the election of a former Wehrmacht intelligence officer, Kurt Waldheim, as a federal president put Austria on the verge of international isolation. Powerful outside pressure and an internal political discussion forced Austrians to reconsider their attitude to the past. Starting with the political administration of the 1990s and followed by most of the Austrian people by the mid-2000s, the nation admitted its collective responsibility for the crimes committed during the Nazi occupation and officially abandoned the \\"victim theory\\". In 1984 in Lackenbach, almost 40 years after the end of war a memorial for the \\"Zigeuner- Anhaltelager\\" Romani was unveiled. A memorial in Kemeten has not yet been started. Prior to the war, 200 Romani people lived in Kemeten. They were deported in 1941; only five of them came back in 1945. In mid-2004, the question of how to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the death of Robert Bernardis, who was shot on 8 August 1944 after being involved in the 20 July plot against Hitler, led to a political conflict. Politicians of the opposition (SPÖ, Grüne) as well as some celebrities suggested renaming a barracks as \\"Robert Bernardis-Kaserne\\", which was turned down by the governing ÖVP and FPÖ. The defence minister Günther Platter (ÖVP) finally decided to build a memorial in the yard of the Towarek-Barrack in Enns. The Green Politician Terezija Stoisits pointed out that a barracks was named after Austrian sergeant Anton Schmid in Germany on 8 May 2004. Schmid was sentenced to death by a Wehrmacht court-martial and was shot on 13 April 1942, after he saved the lives of a hundred Jews in the Vilnius Ghetto. In the first years after the war, many memorials were built in several places, commemorating the dead soldiers of World War II who allegedly fought for their country. For the victims of the Nazi regime, memorials have only been built at a much later time. Since 1992, there is the possibility of doing Zivildienst (alternative National Service) in the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service. Approximately 15 people are deployed in the archive of the concentration camp memorial Mauthausen and alternatively in the camp itself. On 1 September 1992, the first Austrian Holocaust memorial serviceman started working in the Auschwitz- Birkenau State Museum. Andreas Maislinger has taken over the idea from the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace. Annually approximately 30 civil servants are sent to Holocaust memorials and connected institutions in Europe, Israel, USA, South-America and China by the Holocaust Memorial Service. The biggest Austrian Memorial for the remembrance of National Socialist crimes is the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. Part of the Contemporary History Museum Ebensee, it emerged through a private initiative in 2001 and remembers victims of the Ebensee concentration camp. A study in 2019 by the Claims Conference showed that 56% of Austrians do not know that 6 million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust and that 42% are unfamiliar with the Mauthausen concentration camp, located 146 kilometers (90 miles) from Vienna.https://www.timesofisrael.com/most-austrians-dont-know-6-million-jews- were-killed-in-holocaust-survey-finds/ See also * July Putsch * Austrian Civil War References =Citations= =Bibliography= * .

Estació de França is the second busiest railway station of the city after Barcelona-Sants in terms of regional and long-distance ridership. It may lose this status, however, with the arrival of the AVE high-speed train in Sants and the construction of Estació de la Sagrera, planned for completion at the end of 2017, that will concentrate most of the traffic. History Some of the platforms A railway station was first built here in the 19th century as the main terminus for trains arriving from France (as its name still suggests) but also for services to North East Catalonia and the Costa Brava. Rebuilt and reopened for the 1929 International Exhibition, the two monumental buildings that make up the station were designed by the architect Pedro Muguruza and inaugurated by King Alfonso XIII. They surround the railway tracks in the shape of a 'U'. In total, the station's structure is 29 m tall and 195 m long. The station was closed for renovation between from 1988 and 1992, reopening for the Olympic Games of 1992. Architecture It is generally seen as the city's most beautiful station. It is worth seeing in its own right for the restrained mix of classical and more modern style that is complete with decoration in marble, bronze and crystal and its modernista and art déco motifs. Over the last three decades it has been eclipsed as Barcelona's main station by the underground sprawl of Sants. Indeed, most other stations of Barcelona are at least partly underground. The station's status as the terminus for international trains from and through France ended with the discontinuation of the overnight 'trenhotels' in 2013, which coincided with the introduction of the new high- speed daytime TGV services to Paris, Toulouse, Lyons and Marseilles, all of which call at or terminate at Sants. Part of the original building now belongs to Pompeu Fabra University, serving as its \\"França building\\". Lines Façade The station accommodates twelve tracks and seven platforms. It is the terminus for a number of RENFE services: * Rodalies Barcelona: R10 - the half-hourly Barcelona International Airport train via central Barcelona (Passeig de Gràcia railway station and Sants), but suspended for AVE works, temporarily served by R2 SUD to central Barcelona (Passeig de Gràcia railway station and Sants), Viladecans, Gavà, Castelldefels, Sitges, Vilanova i la Geltrú, Calafell and Sant Vicenç de Calders * Medium-distance (Renfe Media Distancia): Ca1, Ca3, Ca4, Ca6 The station is often also used as backup terminal when parts of the railway network are undergoing maintenance; the station received a wide variety of services during upgrades to the Aragó tunnel during winter of 2008. Location The station is located in the east of the city, down between the docks and the zoo. Although it does not have its own metro station, it is easily accessible: directly on the R10 line through central Barcelona (Sants and Passeig de Gràcia), as well as a good five-minute walk from Barceloneta station on line 4 of the Barcelona Metro.

The black casting to the left houses the cylinder, in which slides the piston; the piston rod is immediately above the wheel. The cylinder is the power-producing element of the steam engine powering a steam locomotive. The cylinder is made pressure-tight with end covers and a piston; a valve distributes the steam to the ends of the cylinder. Cylinders were cast in iron and later made of steel. The cylinder casting includes other features such as (in the case of the early Rocket locomotive) valve ports and mounting feet.\\"The Engineering and History of Rocket, a survey report\\", Michael R Bailey and John P Glithero, National Railway Museum 2000, , Drawing 4.37 The last big American locomotives incorporated the cylinders as part of huge one- piece steel castings that were the main frame of the locomotive.1941 Locomotive Cyclopedia of American Practice, Eleventh Edition, Simmons-Boardman Publishing Corporation, p.667 Renewable wearing surfaces were needed inside the cylinders and provided by cast-iron bushings. The way the valve controlled the steam entering and leaving the cylinder was known as steam distribution and shown by the shape of the indicator diagram. What happened to the steam inside the cylinder was assessed separately from what happened in the boiler and how much friction the moving machinery had to cope with. This assessment was known as \\"engine performance\\" or \\"cylinder performance\\". The cylinder performance, together with the boiler and machinery performance, established the efficiency of the complete locomotive. The pressure of the steam in the cylinder was measured as the piston moved and the power moving the piston was calculated and known as cylinder power. The forces produced in the cylinder moved the train but were also damaging to the structure which held the cylinders in place. Bolted joints came loose, cylinder castings and frames cracked and reduced the availability of the locomotive. Cylinders may be arranged in several different ways. Early locomotives On early locomotives, such as Puffing Billy, the cylinders were often set vertically and the motion was transmitted through beams, as in a beam engine. Direct drive The next stage, for example Stephenson's Rocket, was to drive the wheels directly from steeply inclined cylinders placed at the back of the locomotive. Direct drive became the standard arrangement, but the cylinders were moved to the front and placed either horizontal or nearly horizontal. Inside or outside cylinders The front-mounted cylinders could be placed either inside (between the frames) or outside. Examples: * Inside cylinders, Planet locomotive * Outside cylinders, GNR Stirling 4-2-2 In the 19th and early 20th centuries, inside cylinders were widely used in the UK, but outside cylinders were more common in Continental Europe and the United States. The reason for this difference is unclear. From about 1920, outside cylinders became more common in the UK but many inside-cylinder engines continued to be built. Inside cylinders give a more stable ride with less yaw or \\"nosing\\" but access for maintenance is more difficult. Some designers used inside cylinders for aesthetic reasons. Three or four cylinders The demand for more power led to the development of engines with three cylinders (two outside and one inside) or four cylinders (two outside and two inside). Examples: * Three cylinders, SR Class V, LNER Class A4, Merchant Navy class * Four Cylinders, LMS Princess Royal Class, LMS Coronation Class, GWR Castle Class Crank angles On a two-cylinder engine the cranks, whether inside or outside, are set at 90 degrees. As the cylinders are double-acting (i.e. fed with steam alternately at each end) this gives four impulses per revolution and ensures that there are no dead centres. On a three-cylinder engine, two arrangements are possible: * cranks set to give six equally spaced impulses per revolution – the usual arrangement. If the three cylinder axes are parallel, the cranks will be 120 degrees apart, but if the centre cylinder does not drive the leading driving axle, it will probably be inclined (as on most US three- cylinder locomotives and on some of Gresley's three-cylinder locomotives in Great Britain), and the inside crank will be correspondingly shifted from 120 degrees. For a given tractive effort and adhesion factor, a three-cylinder locomotive of this design will be less prone to wheelslip when starting than a 2-cylinder locomotive. * outside cranks set at 90 degrees, inside crank set at 135 degrees, giving six unequally spaced impulses per revolution. This arrangement was sometimes used on three-cylinder compound locomotives which used the outside (low pressure) cylinders for starting. This will give evenly spaced exhausts when the engine is working compound. Two arrangements are also possible on a four-cylinder engine: * all four cranks set at 90 degrees. With this arrangement the cylinders act in pairs, so there are four impulses per revolution, as with a two-cylinder engine. Most four-cylinder engines are of this type. It is cheaper and simpler to use only one set of valve gear on each side of the locomotive and to operate the second cylinder on that side by means of a rocking shaft from the first cylinder's valve spindle since the required valve events at the second cylinder are a mirror image of the first cylinder. * pairs of cranks set at 90 degrees with the inside pair set at 45 degrees to the outside pair. This gives eight impulses per revolution. It increases weight and complexity, by requiring four sets of valve gear, but gives smoother torque and reduces the risk of slipping. This was relatively unusual in British practice but was used on the SR Lord Nelson class. Such locomotives are easily distinguished by their exhaust beats, which occur at twice the frequency of a normal 2- or 4-cylinder engine. Valves The valve chests or steam chests which contain the slide valves or piston valves may be located in various positions. =Inside cylinders= If the cylinders are small, the valve chests may be located between the cylinders. For larger cylinders the valve chests are usually on top of the cylinders but, in early locomotives, they were sometimes underneath the cylinders. =Outside cylinders= The valve chests are usually on top of the cylinders but, in older locomotives, the valve chests were sometimes located alongside the cylinders and inserted through slots in the frames. This meant that, while the cylinders were outside, the valves were inside and could be driven by inside valve gear. Valve gear There are many variations in the location of the valve gear. In British practice, inside valve gear is usually of the Stephenson type while outside valve gear is usually of the Walschaerts type. However, this is not a rigid rule and most types of valve gear are capable of being used either inside or outside. Joy valve gear was once popular, e.g. on the LNWR G Class. =Inside cylinders= On inside-cylinder engines the valve gear is nearly always inside (between the frames), e.g. LMS Fowler Class 3F. =Outside cylinders= On engines with outside cylinders there are three possible variations: * Inside valve gear driving inside valves, e.g. NER Class T2 * Inside valve gear driving outside valves through rocking shafts, e.g. GWR 4900 Class * Outside valve gear driving outside valves, e.g. LSWR N15 Class =Three cylinders= There are three common variations: * Three sets of valve gear (two outside, one inside), e.g. LNER Peppercorn Class A2 * Outside valve gear driving the outside valves. Inside valve driven by Gresley conjugated valve gear, e.g. LNER Class A1/A3 * Three sets of inside valve gear (all valves inside), e.g. NER Class T3 =Four cylinders= There are three common variations: * Four sets of valve gear (two outside, two inside), e.g. SR Lord Nelson Class * Inside valve gear driving the inside valves directly and the outside valves via rocking shafts, e.g. GWR 4073 Class * Outside valve gear driving the outside valves directly and the inside valves via rocking shafts, e.g. LMS Princess Coronation Class Other variations The cylinders on a Shay locomotive. There are many other variations, e.g. geared steam locomotives which may have only one cylinder. The only conventional steam locomotive with one cylinder that is known is the Nielson One-Cylinder Locomotive.

Six people were killed and thirty-six people were injured when a large explosion ripped through the facility. Two firefighters were injured in the subsequent blaze. The disaster occurred twelve years and from the 1991 Hamlet chicken processing plant fire, North Carolina's second-worst industrial disaster. Background The West Pharmaceutical Plant was owned by West Pharmaceutical Services,West Pharmaceutical Services Provides Update on Plant Explosion - findarticles.com - Obtained April 20, 2007. and opened in the early 1980s.Lessons from a factory fire\\", The Christian Science Monitor - Obtained April 18, 2007. The plant employed 255 people with wages of between $12 and $14, some of the highest in the area. The facility's purpose was trifold; to manufacture syringe plungers, to manufacture intravenous components and rubber compounding. In October 2002 an inspector found a total of 22 \\"serious violations\\" at the plant, but said that these were routine findings for numerous industrial premises in North Carolina. West Pharmaceutical Services was fined $10,000 as a result. Event The plant was ripped apart by a violent explosion. Witnesses reported hearing \\"a sound like rolling thunder\\", as what was later determined to be a chain reaction of explosions rapidly propagated. The shock wave broke windows at distances of up to away, and propelled debris as far as , some of which started additional fires in wooded areas at this distance. The blast could be felt away. A large fire raged for two days at the site of the plant.In Final Report on West Pharmaceutical Explosion, CSB Finds Inadequate Controls for Dust Hazards, Calls on North Carolina to Strengthen Fire Code on Combustible Dust - Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board press release - Obtained April 25, 2007.

Investigation The investigation initially focused on two separate possibilities: a failure of a newly installed gas line, and a large dust explosion. From an early stage, the main theory pursued was that of the dust explosion.CSB Team Focuses on Rubber Blending Area in North Carolina Explosion - Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board Press Release - Obtained April 21, 2007. Within 24 hours of the explosion, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, who conducted the investigation, had determined from eyewitness interviews that the explosion originated in an area known as the \\"Automated Compounding System\\". This was a synthetic rubber-processing system. It was the site for mixing, rolling, coating, and drying of a type of rubber called polyisoprene. The process adds oils and fillers to the material, as well as creating significant quantities of dust. Therefore, the working theory from an early point was the rubber dust explosion theory. One particular machine was identified. It coated strips of rubber by dipping in \\"Acumist\\", a finely powdered grade of combustible polyethylene. This machine had operated for 24 hours a day, five or six days a week, since 1987. The spaces around the machine, including a suspended ceiling above the machine, were regularly cleaned by the factory's maintenance personnel. But they were unaware that ventilation systems within the room pulled the dust up into the ceiling, where a layer thick had accumulated. Several weeks prior to the accident, maintenance personnel did notice a thick coating of dust on surfaces above the suspended ceiling, but failed to realize the imminent danger it posed.Preliminary Findings Confirm Blast at West Pharmaceutical Services in Kinston, NC, Was a Dust Explosion Fueled by Plastic Powder Used in Manufacturing - Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board Press Release - Obtained April 21, 2007. The investigation determined that a major explosion occurred when something disturbed the dust, creating a cloud, which ignited. The investigation was unable to determine what disturbed the dust or what ignited it, due to the extensive damage at the plant. However, it is known that the machine had suffered multiple internal fires, including one that was powerful enough to blow off the mixer door.CSB Team Finds Several Possible Sources of Explosive Dust at Destroyed N.C. Medical Plant - Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board Press Release - Obtained April 21, 2007. Four other theories were developed regarding possible causes: a batch of rubber that overheated and ignited; an electrical ballast or light fixture that ignited accumulated dust; a spark caused by a possible electrical fault; or ignition of dust in a cooling air duct feeding an electric motor. It was determined that West had in their possession material safety data sheets (MSDSs) supplied by the powder manufacturer that warned of the danger of such explosions, but did not refer to them. Instead, they relied on the MSDS supplied by Crystal Inc. PMC, who supplied West with a polyethylene-water slurry. However, this second MSDS neglected to mention the hazard posed by dust, as it was not thought to be hazardous once the slurry had dried. The final report into the disaster was highly critical of West, saying that the four \\"root causes\\" of the disaster were West's inadequate engineering assessment for combustible powders, inadequate consultation with fire safety standards, lack of appropriate review of MSDSs, and inadequate communication of dust hazards to workers. It also criticized West for not investigating a minor incident in which dust ignited during welding, from which West could have realized the imminent danger posed by the dust. =Recommendations= The final report made a number of recommendations to prevent a recurrence. A brief summary: * North Carolina's Building Code Council should adopt NFPA 654, a set of building codes which controls operations in environments involving large quantities of combustible dust. In particular, it limits combustible dust accumulations to .In Final Report on West Pharmaceutical Explosion, CSB Finds Inadequate Controls for Dust Hazards, Calls on North Carolina to Strengthen Fire Code on Combustible Dust - CBS press release - Obtained April 25, 2007. * North Carolina's Department of Labor should identify industries at risk of future explosions, and educate people involved with these industries about the potential risk of dust explosions. * North Carolina fire and building code officials should be trained to recognize the hazards posed by flammable dust. * West Pharmaceusticals should improve its material safety review procedures, revise its project engineering practices, communicate with its workers about combustible dust hazards, and follow safety practices contained in NFPA 654 at all company facilities that use combustible powders. *Crystal inc. PMC should modify their MSDSs to discuss the hazards posed by potential dust explosions. Aftermath Less than a week after the disaster, the local county commission voted to donate $600,000 to West to rebuild. A local landlord also offered temporary free office space to company executives.

The board's chairman, Carolyn Merritt, described the accidents as collectively raising \\"safety questions of national significance...

The series ran for eighteen years, from 1943 to this one, published in 1961.Reprinted by London, Egmont in 2003 Plot summary During a school holiday, the children are told by their parents to spend their time visiting sites in the surrounding countryside, rather than searching for mysteries in the village. The children visit an old stately home, Banshee Towers, which is exhibiting famous sea paintings, which Ern and Bets love. The Towers are reputedly haunted and wailing noises are driving visitors away. On a subsequent visit, Ern spots that a small boat he admired in painting is missing. On pointing this out to the owner, the children unwittingly place themselves in danger. After investigating, they discover the owner of the Towers has been conspiring with an art forger and a second member of staff to replace the collection with copies and sell the originals. The novel ends with Fatty saying they will have many more mysteries to solve. This book is a standalone in that the Five Find Outers enter a cave and a secret passage for the first time in their history, more resembling the Famous Five.

History  North Frontenac was created in 1998 by the amalgamation of three municipalities: the Township of Barrie; the Township of Clarendon and Miller; and the Township of Palmerston, North and South Canonto.  Geography  North Frontenac is in the heart of eastern Ontario's cottage country. Cottages and campsites dot the shores of the Township's many clean lakes. Located entirely on the Canadian Shield, the landscape can often be rough and unpredictable, but at the same time provides scenic vistas. Residents, both permanent and seasonal, enjoy a wide variety of outdoor activities. =Communities= The township includes the communities of Ardoch, Beatty, Beech Corners, Canonto, Coxvale, Donaldson, Fernleigh, Harlowe, Mississippi Station, Myers Cave, Ompah, Plevna, Robertsville, Snow Road Station and Wilbur. Old store sign in Ompah Demographics The Township of North Frontenac is a 1,164.73 square km lower-tier municipality, part of Frontenac County, and home to over 1,842 permanent residents. In addition, there are an estimated 5,000 seasonal residents. The low density of the population (1.7 people per km2) makes for the preservation of a scenic landscape. North Frontenac is set in the heart of eastern Ontario's cottage country. For these reasons it is one of the best destinations for outdoor activities and relaxing living in southeastern Ontario.

It serves students from much of Bond County, Illinois, including Pocahontas and Sorento. The school is commonly referred to as GHS and is home to the Greenville Comets sports teams.  History  Greenville has had a high school for 138 years, with the first \\"Greenville High School\\" created in 1869.Allan H. Keith, Historical Stories: About Greenville and Bond County, IL. Consulted on August 15, 2007. The school was begun under the auspices of Samuel Inglis, who would later become the state superintendent of schools. The first building was torn down and a new Central School erected on Second Street in 1894. By 1915, a new school building was located at Beaumont and Wyatt streets. The current building was constructed in 1956; the former Beaumont building was used as Greenville Junior High after the new high school was built. As the new high school opened, high schools in Pocahontas and Sorento closed and those students began attending GHS. Noted environmental activist Howard Zahniser, who wrote the Wilderness Act of 1964, taught English at Greenville High School in the 1930s. 1956 Prohibition Party candidate for President, Enoch A. Holtwick, was a professor of history and government at Greenville College and talked to Greenville High School classes in the 1950s. The yearbook is named The Graduate and has been published since 1918. The school newspaper was originally called The G Whiz, later The GHS Times and then called The Comet Spirit. Country music star Gretchen Wilson attended Greenville High School but did not graduate. Classes Students can take a variety of classes at the school. Students who prefer to study vocational trades can take a bus to Vandalia and attend classes there at Okaw Valley Vocational Center. The building trades class at the center each year purchases property in Vandalia, builds a house, and re-sells it; they have sold 33 homes this way. Library The school employs one full-time librarian; students can serve as workers in the library during their study periods. Students can use the online reference resources, such as OCLC, from school or home to access the billion periodicals that OCLC WorldCat provides access to as research resources. Additionally, as a member of the regional Lewis & Clark Library System and the statewide system IShare (formerly Illininet) and statewide database, the library also provides students with access to thousands of books from hundreds of school, public, and college libraries by way of interlibrary loan.

Traub was a member of the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), a Nazi motorist corps, from 1938 to 1942. He worked directly for Heinrich Himmler, head of the Schutzstaffel (SS), as the lab chief of the Nazis' leading bio-weapons facility on Riems Island. Traub was rescued from the Soviet zone of Germany after World War II and taken to the United States in 1949 under the auspices of the United States government program Operation Paperclip, meant to exploit the post-war scientific knowledge in Germany, and deny it to the Soviet Union. Career =Early career and war= During the 1930s, he studied on a fellowship at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in Princeton, New Jersey mentored by Richard Shope, performing research on vaccines and viruses, including pseudorabies virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM). Traub E, Cultivation of Pseudorabies Virus, J Exp Med, November 30, 1933, 58(6), 663-81. Barthold SW, Introduction: microbes and the evolution of scientific fancy mice, ILAR J, 2008, 49(3), 265-71. During his stay in the United States, Traub and his wife were listed as members of the German American Bund, a pro-Nazi German-American club thirty miles west of Plum Island in Yaphank, Long Island, from 1934 to 1935. Traub worked at the University of Giessen, Germany, from 1938 to 1942. Traub was a member of the Nazi NSKK, a motorist corps, from 1938 to 1942. The NSKK was declared a condemned, not a criminal organization at the Nuremberg trials. From 1942 to 1948, Traub worked as lab-chief at the Reich Research Institute for Virus Diseases of Animals () on Riems Island (), a German animal virus research institute in the Baltic sea, now named the Friedrich Loeffler Institute. The institute was headed by Prof. Dr. Otto Waldmann from 1919 to 1948, while Traub was vice-president. The Institute at Riems Island was a dual use facility during the Second World War where at least some biological warfare experiments were conducted. It had been founded in 1909-10 to study foot-and-mouth disease in animals and by World War II employed about 20 scientists and a staff of 70-120. Hanns-Christoph Nagel, a veterinarian and biological warfare expert for the German Army, conducted experiments there, as did Traub. The institute was administered under the Innenministerium (Ministry of the Interior), which Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over in 1943. The chain of command was Himmler, Dr. Leonardo Conti (Reich Health Leader), Kurt Blome, Waldmann, and then Traub. Traub specialized in viral and bacterial diseases. He was assisted by Anna Bürger, who was later also brought to the United States after the war, to work with the Navy's biological warfare program.A Terrible Mistake: The Murder of Frank Olson and the CIA’s Secret Cold War Experiments - H.P.Albarelli - July 1, 2009 - On orders from Himmler and Blome, the Deputy Reich Health Leader and head of the German biological warfare program, Traub worked on weaponizing foot-and-mouth disease virus, which has been reported to have been dispersed by aircraft onto cattle and reindeer in Russia. In 1944, Blome sent Traub to pick up a strain of Rinderpest virus in Turkey; upon his return, this strain proved inactive (nonvirulent) and therefore plans for a Rinderpest product were shelved. =Post-war= Immediately after the war Traub was trapped in the Soviet zone of Allied occupied Germany. He was forced to work for the Soviets from his lab on Riems Island. In July 1948, the British evacuated Erich Traub from Riems Island as a \\"high priority Intelligence target\\" since it was now in the Soviet Zone and they feared that Traub was assisting in their biological warfare program. Traub denied this, however, claiming that his only interest was foot- and-mouth disease in animals.Paul Maddrell, 'Operation “Matchbox” and the Scientific Containment of the USSR', in P. Jackson & J. Siegel (eds.), Intelligence and Statecraft: The Use and Limits of Intelligence in International Society ( Westport, CT : Praeger Publishers), (2005), pp. 173–206. Traub was brought to the United States in 1949 under the auspices of the United States government program Operation Paperclip, meant to exploit scientific knowledge in Germany, and deny it to the Soviet Union. From 1949 to 1953, he was associated with the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Months into his Operation Paperclip contract, Traub was asked to meet with US scientists from Fort Detrick, the Army’s biological warfare headquarters, in Frederick, Maryland. As a noted German authority on viruses he was asked to consult on their animal disease program from a Biological Warfare perspective. Traub discussed work done at the Reich Research Institute for Virus Diseases of Animals on Riems Island during World War II for the Nazis, and work done after the war there for the Russians. Traub gave a detailed explanation of the secret operation at the Institute, and his activities there. This information provided the ground work for Fort Detrick's offshore germ warfare animal disease lab on Plum Island. His publicly published research from his time in the United States reports disease research not directly related to weaponization. In 1951, he published a report for the Naval Medical Research Institute on Newcastle Disease virus in chicken and mammalian blood cells.Erich Traub, \\"Studies on the In-Vitro Multiplication of Newcastle Disease Virus in Chicken Blood.\\" Naval Medical Research Institute, National Naval Medical Center, 1951. Two years later, he published a paper for the Navy on the mechanisms of immunity in chickens to Newcastle and the possible role of cellular factors.Erich Traub, \\"Studies in the Mechanism of Immunity of Chickens to Newcastle Disease Virus.\\" Naval Medical Research Institute, National Naval Medical Center, 1953. Also in 1953, he published another paper for the Navy with Worth I. Capps on the foot-and-mouth disease virus and methods for rapid adaptation.Erich Traub and Worth I. Capps, \\"Experiments with Chicken Embryo-Adapted Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus and a Method for the Rapid Adaptation.\\" Naval Medical Research Institute, National Naval Medical Center, 1953. Traub served as an expert on foot-and-mouth disease for the FAO of the UN in Bogota, Colombia, from 1951 to 1952, in Tehran, Iran, from 1963 to 1967, and in Ankara, Turkey, from 1969 to 1971. =Return to Germany= Tombstone After working on biological research for the U.S. Navy from 1949 to 1953, Traub returned to Germany and founded a new branch of the Loeffler Institut in Tübingen, and headed it from 1953 to 1963.Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, History: Isle of Riems In 1960, Traub resigned as Tübingen’s director due to the scandal related to accusations of financial embezzlement. He continued with limited lab research for three more years, but then ended his career at Tübingen. In 1964, Traub published a study for the Army Biological labs in Frederick, Maryland on Eastern Equine Encephalomyeltitis (EEE) immunity in white mice and its relationship to Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM), which had long been a research interest of his.Eric Traub, \\"Immunity of White Mice to EEE-VIrus.\\" Report No. 8, Army Biological Labs, Frederick, MD, 1964. He retired from the West German civil service in 1971. In 1972, on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Traub received an honorary doctorate degree in Veterinary Medicine for his achievements in basic and applied Virology (basic research on LCM; definition and diagnosis of type strains of FMD and their variants; development of adsorbate vaccines against fowl plague, Teschner disease of swine, and erysipelas of swine). On May 18, 1985, Traub died in his sleep in West Germany. He was seventy-eight years old. Bio-weapon research In theory, insects of all types, particularly the biting species, can be used as disease vectors in a biological warfare program. Germany, Japan, Britain, Russia and the U.S. all conducted experiments along these lines during the Second World War, and the Japanese used such insect-borne diseases against both soldiers and civilians in China. This was one reason that President Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary of War Henry Stimson ordered the creation of an American biological warfare program in 1942, which was headquartered at Camp Detrick, Maryland. This eventually grew to a very large facility with 245 buildings and a $60 million budget, including an Entomological Weapons Department that mass- produced flies, lice and mosquitoes as disease vectors. Although the British bio-weapon facility at Porton Down concentrated on the production of anthrax bombs, it also conducted experiments on insects as vectors. After the war, the Army's 406th Medical General Laboratory in Japan cooperated with former scientists from Unit 731 in experimenting with many different insect vectors, including lice, flies, mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, spiders and beetles to carry a wide variety of diseases, from cholera to meningitis. At Fort Detrick in the late 1940s, Theodore Rosebury also rated insect vectors very highly, and its entomological division had at least three insect-vectored weapons ready for use by 1950. Some of these were later tested at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, and allegedly used during the Korean War as well.Jeffrey Alan Lockwood, Six-Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War. Oxford, 2009, pp. 145-46; 160-61 Traub visited the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) in New York on at least three occasions in the 1950s. The Plum Island facility, operated by the Department of Agriculture, conducted research on foot-and- mouth disease (FMD) of cattle, one of Traub's areas of expertise. Traub was offered a leading position at Plum Island in 1958 which he officially declined. It has been alleged that the United States performed bioweapons research on Plum Island.Loftus, John (1982). The Belarus Secret. Knopf. . Fort Terry on Plum Island was part of the U.S. biological warfare program in 1944-46, working on veterinary testing in connection with the weaponization of brucellosis. After the war, research on biological weapons continued at Pine Bluff in Arkansas and Fort Detrick, Maryland, while officially at least Plum Island was transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Lebeda, and George Korch (eds), Biological Weapons Defense: Infectious Diseases and Counterterrorism. Humana Press, 2005, pp. 155-84. From 1949, Plum Island also conducted work on biological weapons against animals and livestock, such as foot-and-mouth disease, Rinderpest, Newcastle disease, African swine fever and plague and malaria in birds. Traub's research work from the Second World War onward involved at least the first three of these (all dangerous only to non-human animal species).John Ellis van Courtland Moon, \\"The U.S. Biological Weapons Program\\" in Mark Wheelis, Lajos Rozsa and Malcolm Dando (eds) Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons since 1945.

GADGET is free software for cosmological N-body/SPH simulations written by Volker Springel at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics. The name is an acronym of \\"GAlaxies with Dark matter and Gas intEracT\\". It is released under the GNU GPL. Description GADGET computes gravitational forces with a hierarchical tree algorithm (optionally in combination with a particle-mesh scheme for long- range gravitational forces) and represents fluids by means of smoothed- particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The code can be used for studies of isolated systems, or for simulations that include the cosmological expansion of space, both with or without periodic boundary conditions. In all these types of simulations, GADGET follows the evolution of a self-gravitating collisionless N-body system, and allows gas dynamics to be optionally included. Both the force computation and the time stepping of GADGET are fully adaptive, with a dynamic range which is, in principle, unlimited. GADGET can therefore be used to address a wide array of astrophysically interesting problems, ranging from colliding and merging galaxies, to the formation of large-scale structure in the universe. With the inclusion of additional physical processes such as radiative cooling and heating, GADGET can also be used to study the dynamics of the gaseous intergalactic medium, or to address star formation and its regulation by feedback processes. History The first public version (GADGET-1, released in March 2000 was created as part of Volker's PhD project under the supervision of Simon White. Later, the code was continuously improved during postdocs of Volker Springel at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the Max Planck Institute, in collaboration with Simon White and Lars Hernquist. The second public version (GADGET-2, released in May 2005 contains most of these improvements, except for the numerous physics modules developed for the code that go beyond gravity and ordinary gas- dynamics. The most important changes lie in a new time integration model, a new tree-code module, a new communication scheme for gravitational and SPH forces, a new domain decomposition strategy, a novel SPH formulation based on entropy as independent variable, and finally, in the addition of the TreePM functionality.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on June 7, 1952, and features Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian. The title is a pun on the movie title The Hasty Heart. Synopsis Marvin the Martian (here referred to as Commander of the X2 vessel) is traveling to Earth. Upon landing, he opens his assignment envelope - return one Earth creature back to Mars (signed by General E=mc²). With the help of his dog, K-9 (who \\"talks\\" to Marvin by handing him notes), he finds Bugs' rabbit hole. As the two observe the hole, they are pushed back when Bugs cleans out a bucket of carrot stems. Seeing their getup, Bugs assumes it must be Halloween, so he hands them each a bag of treats. Marvin then decides that he shall \\"have\\" to use force. He pulls out his disintegrating gun, and atomizes a large hole where the small rabbit hole used to be. Bugs shrieks \\"How Halloween-y can you get?\\" before seeing the flying saucer. Marvin then tells Bugs that he is to come back to Mars with him. Bugs tries to act defiant, but goes slightly insane when Marvin uses his pistol against a nearby rock (which also disintegrates part of the ground under the rock). He quickly gets some bags and runs into the ship, then runs back out as a train conductor (a play on Mel Blanc's train conductor character on the Jack Benny show), telling Marvin and K-9 \\"Flying saucer, for Saturn, Neptune, Jupiter, Venus, the Dog Star and Mars now leaving on track five! All aboard!\\" Marvin and K-9 rush on the ship and fly off, then realize their mistake in midflight and fly back (\\"Oh! That wasn't a bit nice! [huff, puff] You have made me very angry, [huff, puff] very angry indeed!\\"). Bugs convinces Marvin that he wants to go to Mars, then insinuates that K-9 is plotting mutiny. Marvin calls K-9 over and atomizes him, but K-9 pulls himself out of his helmet, asking what he did wrong (signed, \\"Anxious\\"). Bugs starts walking off, but Marvin and K-9 shoot him with an Acme straitjacket-ejecting bazooka. On the ship, Marvin is piloting while K-9 watches over Bugs (labeled as \\"One over-confident Earth creature\\"). Bugs convinces K-9 to let him \\"try on something more sporty\\". Now out of the straitjacket, Bugs quickly ties K-9 up, then grabs another jacket and yells \\"Everybody desert ship! We've struck an iceberg and we're sinking fast! Here, get into this life preserver, quick!\\" as he wraps Marvin in the spare straitjacket. Now with both of them tied up (labeled as \\"Two disgruntled Martians\\"), Bugs tries turning the ship back home. After a brief out-of- control spin, he starts to fly back, but throws out an anchor to steady the ship. The anchor then pulls on a crescent moon, which in turn pulls on Saturn's rings, a large planet (presumably Jupiter) and other assorted stars. Back on Earth, a small man in an observatory looks into his telescope, only to see the spaceship and the planets directly in front of him. The man then writes a note (\\"I resign! When I begin to see things like this, it's time to take up turkey farming.\\" Signed, I. Frisby (a reference to Friz Freleng, whose caricature was indeed used for the character) and leaves. Outside, Bugs asks the man if he knows where he can sell a \\"slightly used flying saucer -- it's only got 3 billion miles on it.\\" The man then starts to have a mental breakdown in a goofy matter, causing Bugs with an annoyed look to ask the audience,: \\"Huh, what's biting him?\\" References External links * Category:1952 films Category:1952 animated films Category:1952 short films Category:1950s American animated films Category:1950s animated short films Category:1950s science fiction films Category:Animated films about extraterrestrial life Category:Mars in film Category:Short films directed by Chuck Jones Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:American films Category:American animated short films Category:Films featuring Bugs Bunny Category:Films featuring Marvin the Martian ","title":"The Hasty Hare"},{"id":"10759491","text":"The Battle of Walcheren Causeway (Operation Vitality) was an engagement of the Battle of the Scheldt between the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade, elements of the British 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division and troops of the German 15th Army in 1944.

This forced the Allies to bring all supplies for their rapidly advancing armies from the artificial harbor they had constructed off the beaches of Normandy, and from Cherbourg. Because of its port capacity Antwerp became the immediate objective of the British 21st Army Group commanded by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. While Antwerp fell to Montgomery on September 4 no supplies could be landed there until the German forces holding the lower reaches of the Scheldt, between Antwerp and the North Sea, were removed. =Tactical importance= A feature known as the Sloe Channel separated the island of Walcheren from the South Beveland isthmus. A narrow causeway connected the two, known to the Dutch as the Sloedam (it literally dammed the Sloe Channel) and in English as the Walcheren Causeway. The causeway carried a rail line from the mainland onto the island and to the port of Vlissingen (or Flushing, as it was known in English). A paved road also ran the length of the causeway, which was about 40 metres wide and a kilometer long. On either side of this causeway, which was elevated only a few feet above sea level, marsh, mud-flats and deep water all hindered movement between Walcheren and South Beveland. Prelude 300px As the Allies had to secure a port of the capacity of Antwerp before they could contemplate the invasion of Germany itself, the Battle of the Scheldt involved some of the most bitter fighting of the war.Winston S. Churchill, The Second World War, v.6 Triumph and Tragedy, pp190-195, 200-205 By 31 October 1944, all lands surrounding the Scheldt estuary had been cleared of German control, save for Walcheren Island, whose coastal batteries commanded the approaches to the waterway. These guns prevented the Allies from making use of the port facilities of Antwerp to alleviate their logistical concerns. The island's dykes had been breached by attacks from RAF Bomber Command: on 3 October at Westkapelle, with severe loss of civilian life; on 7 October at two places, west and east of Vlissingen; and on 11 October at Veere. This flooded the central part of the island, forcing the German defenders onto the high ground around the outside and in the towns. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division had marched west down the South Beveland isthmus and by the 31st had cleared all German opposition from South Beveland. Walcheren Island was connected to South Beveland by a narrow causeway, 40 metres wide and 1600 metres long. Plans to employ assault boats over the Sloe Channel were thwarted by muddy conditions unsuitable for water craft. The Calgary Highlanders had been selected for this amphibious operation, as they had received stormboat training in the UK in anticipation of an opposed water crossing of the Seine River, which invasion planners had predicted would be necessary approximately 90 days after the landings in Normandy. In the event, the ground was too boggy to employ the boats, and the Highlanders were utilized as conventional infantry in a landward attack directly over the causeway.

A battalion of Glasgow Highlanders were ordered to pass through, but they also were unable to expand the bridgehead on the island.Stacey, C.P. Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War. Volume II: The Victory Campaign Aftermath Landings by British Commandos of the 4th Commando Brigade eventually sealed the fate of the German defenders on Walcheren Island, attacking from seaward at Flushing and Westkapelle. The battle for the causeway itself had been a costly, and ultimately unnecessary, diversion.Copp, Terry The Brigade The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division went into reserve in the first week of November, moving into the Nijmegen Salient for the winter. The Calgary Highlanders suffered 64 casualties in the 3 days of fighting at Walcheren Causeway. Le Régiment de Maisonneuve had one man killed and 10 wounded. The Black Watch suffered 85 casualties in the period 14 October to 1 November 1944, the bulk of them suffered on the causeway.The Brigade Legacy Lieutenant Colonel Mike Vernon, CD, Commanding Officer of The Calgary Highlanders, ponders the monument to the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade The Battle of Walcheren Causeway is commemorated annually by The Calgary Highlanders and Regimental Pipes and Drums with a parade and church service on the Wednesday night or weekend closest to the anniversary of the battle. Representatives and members of the local Dutch community in Calgary are usually invited to attend the service. The battle was selected from among the Regiment's 20 Second World War battle honours as being most representative of the spirit of determination displayed by the unit's forerunners, the 10th Battalion, CEF, whose counterattack at St. Julien during the Second Battle of Ypres is also commemorated annually by the Regiment. A permanent monument was erected at the causeway and dedicated in the 1980s. The causeway itself no longer exists as such; land on both sides of the former railway embankment has been reclaimed and the Sloe Channel is now farmland. Remnants of German concrete fortifications still exist both on Walcheren Island and South Beveland. In the 21st century, the monuments were moved due to rail and road construction. A large monument dedicated to the French troops that fought a battle there in May 1940 predominates, overlooking memorials to both the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade who fought there in the autumn of 1944. Other battles Brief fighting had occurred in the vicinity of the causeway and Arnemuiden in May 1940 during the German invasion of the Netherlands.The Dutch book Slagveld Sloedam gives details of all the Walcheren Causeway battles.

Named for Bellerophon (a hero of Greek mythology, the son of Eurymede by either the Corinthian King, Glaucus, or the sea god, Poseidon), she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Originally planned as an LST, she was redesignated as landing craft repair ship ARL-31 prior to construction. The ship was laid down on 12 December 1944 at Seneca, Illinois by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company; launched on 7 March 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Hazel Nitherspoon; and commissioned on 19 March 1945 with Lieutenant Perry P. Wynn in command. Service history On 21 March 1945 the ship sailed for Mobile, Alabama where she was placed out of commission on 31 March to be fitted out as a landing craft repair ship by the Alabama Drydock & Shipbuilding Company. The conversion was completed that summer, and USS Bellerophon (ARL-31) was recommissioned on 21 July 1945 at Mobile with Lieutenant Samuel H. Alexander, USNR, in command. On 31 July the ship began a fortnight's shakedown cruise that took her to Galveston, Texas. She returned to Mobile on 14 August and began preparations for an overseas deployment. On 1 September Bellerophon departed Mobile and headed for the Pacific Ocean. After transiting the Panama Canal, she headed up the west coast toward San Francisco. She made a stop at San Diego before arriving at Treasure Island on 3 October. There, the ship began duty as the repair ship for a newly formed boat pool. When a strike by civilian workers paralyzed civilian yards during the latter part of October, Bellerophon began making voyage repairs to Operation Magic Carpet ships while also carrying out some conversion work to enable attack cargo ships to serve as passenger carriers. That work lasted until the spring of 1946. On 26 March 1946 she departed San Francisco bound for Hawaii. Upon her arrival in Pearl Harbor, she was assigned to the Commander, Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet, for duty repairing amphibious warfare ships. She concluded that assignment on 16 July and got underway to return to the west coast. The ship arrived in San Diego at the end of July and resumed repair work on amphibious ships. Bellerophon remained so engaged until placed out of commission at San Diego in September 1947. She remained in reserve, first at San Diego and later at Bremerton, Washington for the next three decades. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in October, 1977 and she was sold on 20 June 1980 to the Levin Metals Corporation of Richmond, California for scrapping.

It is an order made at an interim stage during the trial, and is usually issued to maintain the status quo until judgment can be made. Jurisdictions =Australia= In Australia, the High Court in ABC v Lenah Game Meats. stated that the purpose of the interlocutory injunction is to preserve identifiable legal or equitable rights.See . The basic proposition remains that where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought in a Judicature system court, it is necessary to identify the legal (which may be statutory) or equitable rights which are to be determined at trial and in respect of which there is sought final relief which may or may not be injunctive in nature. In another Australian High Court decision, Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia,. Mason CJ outlined another requirement for establishing an interlocutory injunction. He suggested that the plaintiff had to show that 'irreparable injury' would be suffered, for which common law damages would not be adequate compensation, unless an injunction was granted. The main difficulty associated with granting an interlocutory injunction is that the court must consider whether the likelihood of a legal action being established is sufficiently strong for the injunction to be granted.See .See also . =Canada = The Federal Court of Canada has of recent years been reluctant to grant interlocutory injunctions, having set a high bar for the evidence of irreparable harm.

History St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin is the eastern half of the historic St. Croix Chippewa Indians who lost federal recognition in 1854. St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin re-gained their federal recognition under the Indian Reorganization Act. The western half of the historical tribe, the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, are non-Federally recognized component of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe. Due to loss of Federal recognition in 1854, as one of two successors apparent of the historical St. Croix Chippewa Indians, the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin do not have a formal Indian Reservation. Today The St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin is a federally recognized tribe governed by a five-member council elected for two-year terms. The Tribal Council is responsible for the general welfare of tribal members and the management of day-to-day tribal business. The Council is governed by the tribal constitution and by-laws, which were originally ratified in 1934 under the Indian Reorganization Act. Their current population (as of 2014) is 1,054 tribal members. Due to not having a formal Indian Reservation, the lands constituting the St. Croix Indian Reservation are composed of small tracts of lands representing communities made up of families who have frequently lived in the same vicinity for generations. The reservation communities are scattered with about being the longest distance between any two of them. The five major communities are Sand Lake, Danbury, Round Lake, Maple Plain, and Gaslyn. They occupy land in Barron, Burnett, and Polk counties. Of the total resident population of 641 persons as of the 2000 census, 370 live in Burnett County, 197 in Polk County, and 74 in Barron County.

History  = Early days = Onitsuka Tiger's first product was a basketball shoe resembling a straw sandal in many ways. The design was discarded by many and Onitsuka returned to the design stage to better acclimate his shoes for the way in which basketball players started and stopped on the floor. By adding cups and small spaces in the soles of his basketball shoes, Onitsuka made a more effective shoe in 1952 which soon became popular throughout Japan. In 1955, the company increased its business to 500 sports shops across Japan. Onitsuka Tiger worked with marathon runner Toru Terasawa in 1953 to develop a running shoe that would keep long distance runners from developing blisters. Ethiopian runner Abebe Bikila started wearing Onitsuka Tiger shoes in 1957, the first time in his running career he had ever worn shoes, convinced by Onitsuka that they would be superior to his barefoot style. The shoes were also worn in 1958 by short-distance runner Oliver Skilton when he won bronze in the Continental European games. In 1959, the sneakers brand launched the Magic Runner with improved technology on ventilation to prevent blisters and build comfort. = Early partnership with Nike = In the late 1950s, University of Oregon middle-distance runner Philip Knight was coached by Bill Bowerman, one of the top coaches in the US. Bowerman was also known for experimenting with the design of running shoes to make them lighter and more shock-absorbent. After attending Oregon, Knight continued his studies at Stanford University, where he wrote his MBA thesis on the marketing of athletic shoes. After receiving his degree, Knight travelled to Japan where he contacted Onitsuka Tiger Co. Ltd, and convinced the company that their product had a market in the US. In 1963, Knight received his first shipment of Tiger shoes, and later he and Bowerman invested $500 each to form Blue Ribbon Sports (later known as Nike, Inc.). = Development of brands = Classic 70's volleyball trainers. AcTiger Volley 55 In 1964, Onitsuka listed the company on the Kobe Stock Exchange and later on the exchanges of Osaka and Tokyo. The ASICS stripe was first introduced in 1966 during the pre-olympic trials for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. LIMBER was the first model to feature ASICS stripes on the side of the upper section. These lines were the famous design icon on another Onitsuka tiger shoe, the LIMBER leather, now called MEXICO 66. In 1968, Blue Ribbon Sports started importing LIMBER UP to the American market. In 1968 their running shoes were the TG-4 \\"Marathons\\" which were all nylon uppers and flat rubber soles. They retailed for about $6.00. Their training shoe had an all leather white upper, and thickly padded soles, and was named the \\"Cortez.\\" They also had an all around exercise shoe called the \\"Bangkok\\" and racing spikes. Blue Ribbon Sports had their first store on the East Coast in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, which was very near the Boston Marathon route. Jeff Johnson was the manager, and he would attend many AAU meets, as well as high school cross country races, where he would be commonly seen selling his Onitsuka brand shoes from the trunk of his red Austin-Healey 3000 sports car. In the 1970s, Onitsuka Tiger introduced the FABRE, standing for the FAstBREak move in basketball. The Japanese team wore the FABRE at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, where they finished 14th. In 1972, GTO, Jelenk, and Onitsuka combined their financial and athletic positions to build a regional sales office near Hokkaido for the 1972 Winter Olympics. In 1977, all sports brands of the company were merged into the brand ASICS. In 1976, Finnish runner Lasse Virén won both the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal while wearing Onitsuka Tigers, after having worn Adidas while winning those events in the 1972 Olympics. Today, the company is still known as ASICS and provides shoes to retailers around the globe. = 2000's relaunch = Onitsuka Tiger shoes in store in Osaka. The brand was then abandoned and relaunched in 2002, capitalizing on the new trend of vintage sneakers. In 2003, Uma Thurman wore gold-colored Onitsuka Taichi sneakers with black stripes with her famous yellow outfit in the movie Kill Bill. By 2007, the brand had opened 23 standalone stores. In 2008, Onitsuka Tiger launched a premium series, Nippon Made. In 2009, to celebrate its 60-year anniversary, Onitsuka Tiger launched its history book Made of Japan. In 2015, Onitsuka Tiger partnered with US-based design company Bait to create a Bruce Lee series. In 2017, sales of the brand grew by 20% to 31.9 billion yen. In July 2017, Onitsuka Tiger launched the what it publicized as the first augmented reality sneakers, but was merely an app animating the shoe's logo on a phone screen.  Description  Since Onitsuka Tiger was incorporated in 1949, shoes have been created for football, running, martial arts, basketball, cheerleading, volleyball, cross-training, track and field, wrestling, golf, cricket, fencing, and tennis. The most famous brand of Onitsuka Tiger shoes is the striped Mexico 66 Line. ASICS still sells vintage style Onitsuka Tiger shoes, including the Mexico 66. The ASICS acronym stands for “Anima Sana in Corpore Sano” or “A Healthy Soul in a Healthy Body.”, an adaptation of the ancient aphorism in Juvenal and elsewhere, \\"Mens sana in corpore sano\\". In Asics' portfolio, the Asics brand is oriented towards sports performance, while the Onitsuka Tiger brand is imprinted in the casual sneaker fashion.

When the string \\"Bush hid the facts\\", without newline or quotes, was put in a new Notepad document and saved, closed, and reopened, the nonsensical sequence of Chinese characters \\"\\" would appear instead. While \\"Bush hid the facts\\" is the sentence most commonly presented on the Internet to induce the error, the bug can be triggered by many strings with letters and spaces in the same positions, for example . Other sequences trigger the bug as well, including even the text . The bug occurs when the string is passed to the Win32 charset detection function \`IsTextUnicode\`. \`IsTextUnicode\` sees that the bytes match the UTF-16LE encoding of valid (if nonsensical) Chinese Unicode characters, concludes that the text is valid UTF-16LE Chinese and returns \`true\`, and the application then incorrectly interprets the text as UTF-16LE. The bug had existed since \`IsTextUnicode\` was introduced with in 1994, but was not discovered until early 2004. Many text editors and tools exhibit this behavior on Windows because they use \`IsTextUnicode\` to determine the encoding of text files. As of Windows Vista, Notepad has been modified to use a different detection algorithm that does not exhibit the bug, but \`IsTextUnicode\` remains unchanged in the operating system, so any other tools that use the function are still affected. Workarounds Several workarounds exist for this bug: *Editing the text to not be a pattern that triggers this bug will avoid it. For instance, adding a new line in the first 20 characters will work. *If the file is saved as \\"UTF-8\\" rather than \\"ANSI\\" the text loads correctly, because Notepad prepends a UTF-8 byte order mark, which is a pattern that does not trigger the bug. UTF-8 without the byte order mark would still trigger the bug, as this sequence is represented identically in UTF-8 as in ASCII. *The bug is also avoided by saving as \\"Unicode\\", which in Microsoft Windows means UTF-16LE. When loading this text \`IsTextUnicode\` should (and does) return true and the text is correct. *To retrieve the original text using Notepad, bring up the \\"Open a file\\" dialog box, select the file, select \\"ANSI\\" or \\"UTF-8\\" in the \\"Encoding\\" list box, and click Open. Under Windows 2000, Notepad lacks the \\"Encoding\\" list box. Notepad2 also lacks this. WordPad appears to load the text correctly without choosing the encoding, since it uses its own encoding detection.

The trail is built on the former right of way of the Leavenworth, Lawrence and Galveston Railroad from Ottawa, Kansas, to Iola, Kansas. The trail runs 50 miles from its northern terminus at Ottawa, Kansas to its southern terminus at Iola, Kansas. The trail is open for use by hikers, joggers, and bicyclists year-round, from sunrise to sunset. This trail is paved with a hard-packed limestone screening outside of the city limits of Ottawa, Garnett, and Iola. Inside Ottawa, Garnett, and Iola, the trail is paved with asphalt. A Kansas State Park vehicle permit is not required, but a separate trail permit (daily/annual) must be purchased for those using the trail outside the city limits of Ottawa, Garnett, and Iola. During flooding in June 2007, a section of the bridge carrying the trail over Pottawatomie Creek north of Garnett washed out. The bridge has since been replaced. Trail Route The trail's northern terminus is located at the Old Depot Museum in Ottawa, Kansas at . The Museum and terminus of the trail is located just north of the Marais Des Cygnes River in downtown Ottawa. From Ottawa, the trail heads south and detours from the right of way to cross under Interstate 35 at its intersection with US Highway 59. Continuing to the south from Ottawa, the trail hits two small railroad towns, Princeton and Richmond. Garnett, located about midway on the right of way between Ottawa and Iola features a restored Santa Fe depot which is used as the city's trailhead. The depot serves as a rest stop for trail users, as well as an information center for the city. Phase 3 of the trail spans from Welda, Kansas, to Iola, Kansas, passing the small towns of Colony and Carlyle. Colony and Iola trailheads feature both restrooms and water, while the Carlyle trailhead has only a single restroom without water. Trail mile markers for phase three include mile 99 at Colony, mile 104 at Carlyle, Kansas, and mile 109 at the Iola terminating trailhead at .

This extension is named the Southwind Rail-Trail, and opened to the public on June 10, 2013. Future aspirations of the trail include intersecting the future Flint Hills Nature Trail, a trail currently under construction connecting Herington, Kansas, to the west, and Osawatomie, Kansas, to the east, in Ottawa. The eastern section from Ottawa to Osawatomie is completed. This trail is also part of the ambitious Quad-State Trail project which will connect trails together in Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa. The project also includes the Katy Trail State Park in Missouri. Management The park is routinely patrolled by staff of the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism and other law-enforcement agencies. Only non-motorized vehicles, and motorized wheelchairs, are allowed. A daily-use per-person permit is $3.50, and may be purchased at self-pay stations located at the Ottawa, Princeton, Richmond, Garnett, Welda, Carlyle, and Iola trail heads.

Named for the World's Greatest Tobacco Market, WGTM was founded in the 1930s by the Wilson Tobacco Board of Trade. The station originally transmitted at 1310 kc. and last operated on 590 kHz with 5000 watts full- time. 106.7 WGTM-FM was silenced by Hurricane Hazel which destroyed the tower in October 1954. Owned by Campbell Broadcasting in the 1960s until 1985, WGTM had a block-type format, featuring local news, country, AC, gospel, & rock. It was then sold to Willis Broadcasting and the format changed to black gospel and talk, with Red Hot Issues weekday mornings with host and owner Celestine Willis and Tawanna Fields. The studios were located in the back of a church supply store on Hwy 42 West of Wilson. The transmitter site is near Rock Ridge and features a 4 tower array that covers a large part of eastern North Carolina. In the 1950s and '60s the studios were located on US Highway 301 and later just off of I-95. Many singers and entertainers were known to stop by the studios while traveling through and drop off their latest record or do a quick interview. WGTM also featured one of the first African American D.J.s in the south, Ted Hooker. Hooker hosted Ebony Hit Parade and the Sepia Serenade later at night. Also a first for the Wilson station was a live teenage program which remoted from the Melody Park Fun land off of Highway 301 North of town. Dick Ellis took requests live from the local teens during the program Night Beat. The park featured a broadcast booth on top of the former drive-in- theatre snack bar and a \\"stove-pipe-blower\\" devise that would send written song requests up to a basket in the booth from the dance floor. Each year, the winners of the yearly dance contest held at the park would win a free trip to appear on the Dick Clark American Bandstand show in Philly. Hosts/announcers from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s include Bill Bunn, Roger Philyaw, John Tew who was hired in 1965 to spearhead the \\"BIG SWITCH\\" which took the station to a full time top 40 format.

Its sportscasters included Carlester Crumpler and Alton Britt. During the early 1980s, Greg Flowers was the news director and Ben Lovelace was the farm news director. WGTM moved from its longtime studio on NC 42 West in mid-2009. The building has a \\"For Sale\\" sign posted in front, and the decades- old STL tower has been removed. In November the station was forced from the air when the power was cut to the transmitter site by the local power company. WGTM returned to the air from a rented studio in December 2009 and fell silent again on March 13, 2010. WGTM was deleted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on December 2, 2011, for failure to file for the renewal of its license (which expired a day earlier).

In 1940, at the age of 20, Herbeck was committed to the national mental hospital in Lower Austria (Niederösterreich) where he spent almost his entire life, writing thousands of poems, until his death on 11 September 1991. Life Herbeck grew up in Stockerau, Lower Austria, where at the age of 20 whilst working as an unskilled worker in a munitions factory, began displaying signs of schizophrenia. He was first committed in 1940, but at times his condition would improve momentarily. In October 1944 he was even called into military service only to be discharged in March 1945. A year after the end of the war Herbeck was committed indefinitely. After fifteen years in an institution Herbeck began writing poetry, often referred to as naive, his poetry is notable for its brevity and peculiar turn of phrase. The titles of many of his poems are the names of animals that were offered to him by his psychiatrist Leo Navratil as exercises. Two years before his death Herbeck gave over 1,000 of his handwritten sheets to the Austrian national library as donation. Legacy W. G. Sebald wrote an article about Herbeck entitled Das Häschens Kind, der kleine Has: On the poet Ernst Herbeck's totem animal, the hare, collected in the book Campo Santo. Sebald also recounts a visit with an elderly Ernst Herbeck in his novel Vertigo. Herbeck also featured as a character in Philipp Weiss's 2013 play Ein schöner Hase ist meistens der Einzellne.

It is a fairly common fungus, both in North America and Europe, found growing among short green grass. Until recently, the species was also commonly called Conocybe lactea or Conocybe albipes and is colloquially known as the white dunce cap .Index Fungorum - Names Record Another common synonym, Bolbitius albipes G.H. Otth 1871, places the fungus in the genus Bolbitius. Description Easily missed due to their very small size, C. apala fruit bodies are otherwise quite easy to identify. The cap has a pale cream to silvery-white colour and may sometimes have a darker yellow to brown coloration towards the central umbo. Its trademark hood-shaped conical cap expands with age and may flatten out, the surface being marked by minute radiating ridges. The cap can be up to 3 cm in diameter. The gills may be visible through the thin cap and these are coloured rust or cinnamon brown and quite dense. They are adnexed or free and release brown to reddish-brown elliptical spores producing a spore print of the same colour. The stem is cap- coloured, elongated, thin, hollow and more or less equal along its length with a height up to 11 cm and diameter 0.1 to 0.3 cm. It can bear minuscule striations or hairs. The flesh of C. apala has no discernible taste or smell and is extremely fragile to the touch. Habitat C. apala is a saprobe found in areas with rich soil and short grass such as pastures, playing fields, lawns, meadows as well as rotting manured straw, fruiting single or sparingly few ephemeral bodies. It is commonly found fruiting during humid, rainy weather with generally overcast skies. It will appear on sunny mornings while there is dew but will not persist once it evaporates. In most cases, by midday the delicate fruiting bodies shrivel, dry and fade from sight. C.apala's fruiting season begins in spring and ends in autumn.

The Similkameen Rush was one of a flurry of small rushes peripheral to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, which had drawn tens of thousands of prospectors to the new colony in 1858-1859, among the others being Rock Creek Gold Rush and Big Bend. Discovery of gold on the upper Similkameen River in 1860 led to the establishment of the town of Blackfoot, also known as Blackfoot Flat and adjoined by a neighbouring settlement, Blackwood Flat, seven miles southwest of what is now Princeton near the site of the later mining town-cum-ghost town Allenby. The population of the town in the fall of 1860 was approximately 100, a mix of white and Chinese miners. By the summer of 1861 its population was reported as only about 50. High water made mining operations on the river difficult, but bench claims, above the water-mark, proved successful and one shaft was sunk in an effort to find hard-rock deposits. Blackfoot and Blackwood Flat contained 40 houses, including a store and other services. Blackfoot disappeared nearly as quickly as it had appeared as the ever-fickle miners moved on in search of richer and easier diggings. Six years after being one of the original participants on the Similkameen Rush, \\"Jackass John\\" returned from prospecting in Montana and the Kootenays. He mined on the same spot where he had made $40 in two days during the original rush and in fourteen days had taken $900. He enlisted three friends and worked the mine; historian H.H. Bancroft notes that the four partners sluiced $240 in three days. ::\\"An article in the Similkameen Star in 1935 that the site of Blackfoot was \\"relocated and identified with Kruger's bar. According to H. Jamieson iron spikes in a river boulder indicated until recently where a bridge had crossed to the store and hotel on (the) south side of the river. Theodore Kruger, who gave his name to the (bar), was born in Hanover in 1929, and came to British Columbia in 1858. Like Mr. Allison, who arrived the same year, he had tried mining on the Fraser before coming to Similkameen\\". In the 1880s, discovery of further placer diggings on the South Fork of the Similkameen River led to the Tulameen Gold Rush and the founding of Granite Creek and Tulameen.

The film was selected by Mexico as its entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 51st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences In July 2018, it was selected to be screened in the Venice Classics section at the 75th Venice International Film Festival.  Plot  The film opens on a man driving a truck. He stops in front of a house and begins honking the horn. Inside, Manuela (Roberto Cobo) and her daughter, known as Japonesita (Ana Martín), are asleep. Manuela panics, recognizing the honk as that of Pancho (Gonzalo Vega), a man who has attacked her before, destroying her red flamenco dress. Manuela wakes the other prostitutes in the brothel in search of red thread to mend the dress. She is sent instead to Ludovinia, an elderly, deaf woman who gives her the thread. Ludovinia reveals that Don Alejo (Fernando Soler), the town's mayor, had once taken a liking to Pancho, hiring him to drag his daughter, Moniquita, in wagon and encouraging him to go to school. As Manuela leaves, she bumps into Don Alejo, who offers to buy the brothel. Meanwhile, Pancho is at the gas station of his brother in law, Octavio. Octavio is closing the gas station because the town has been reduced to practically nothing. They complain about Don Alejo, who has been systematically buying all of the property. Don Alejo had also lent Pancho the money for his truck, and came to collect a payment. Japonesita, looking for Don Alejo, walks in after their interaction and finds Pancho crying. He attacks her for seeing him in this state, but relents. He tells her that Don Alejo is a bad man, but she refuses to believe it, insisting that Don Alejo had promised to restore the electricity to the brothel. Pancho tells her that Don Alejo was the one who had cut it in the first place. After Manuela and Japonesita fight over the possible sale of the brothel, Japonesita declares that she wants to decorate it the way her mother, La Japonesa, would have. This angers Manuela, and Japonesita locks herself in their room, opening a case of La Japonesa's things. A flashback begins that depicts how Manuela and La Japonesa met. Manuela arrived with a troupe of dancers and singers for Don Alejo's inauguration. In the scene it is clear that Don Alejo has already begun backing out on promises he had made to the community. Manuela begins to dance to raucous boos, but Don Alejo insists on letting her finish. She is swept up by several men and the party leaves for the river. Manuela is pushed in the river and stripped. When they declare, \\"She's a man!\\" Manuela says dismissively, \\"It's only good for peeing.\\" La Japonesa is inspired. She places a bet with Don Alejo that she can get Manuela aroused and \\"make her a man.\\" Don Alejo, disbelieving, offers her ownership of the brothel if he can watch them have sex. La Japonesa enters Manuela's room and begins kissing her, and it cuts to Don Alejo leaving the doorway, apparently satisfied with the bargain. After, Manuela declares her love for La Japonesa but is rebuffed. \\"If you fall in love with me you'll become a man, brutish and rude.\\" In present day, Octavio lends the money for Pancho to pay off Don Alejo, and they celebrate his freedom by going to the brothel. Manuela hides, watching through the window as Pancho and Japonesita dance. Pancho insists that Japonesita \\"owes him\\" for the tears she saw. He starts to hurt her, roughing her up and demanding Manuela. Japonesita insists that Manuela has gone as Pancho gets increasingly violent. Manuela eventually bursts in in her red flamenco gown, dancing seductively for Pancho. They eventually begin kissing until Octavio sees them and breaks them up. Pancho turns on Manuela, insisting that she did it to try and make him gay. Manuela runs away screaming, chased by Pancho and Octavio in the truck. Don Alejo and Renaldo, his servant, see them and follow all the way to the quarry where Manuela is cornered. Renaldo repeatedly asks Don Alejo if he should shoot Pancho and Octavio but Don Alejo says no, even as Pancho beats Manuela. He finally kills her with a kick to the head, and Pancho and Octavio drive away. Don Alejo promises to see them behind bars. \\"They will learn what it really means to be macho.\\" Manuela's bloody head is shown. At the brothel, another prostitute expresses her concern to Japonesita. Japonesita says not to worry, that Manuela will return, beat up \\"as usual\\". The last image is of Japonesita turning out her oil lamp.  Cast  * Roberto Cobo ... Manuela * Lucha Villa ... La Japonesa * Ana Martín ... Japonesita * Gonzalo Vega ... Pancho * Julián Pastor ...

Early Life Nagler was born in Marysville, California and raised in nearby Arboga He attended Marysville High School, where he was an all-league selection in football his junior and senior years. He attended the University of Santa Clara, majoring in history, and was a captain of the varsity football team in his senior year. NFL Career Nagler was drafted in the 14th round of the 1953 NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns. Prior to the season starting, the Browns completed a fifteen-player trade -- which set the NFL record for the largest trade ever executed -- that sent Nagler and nine other players to the Baltimore Colts. The Colts then waived him prior to the start of the 1953 NFL season. He was claimed off waivers by the Chicago Cardinals. In his rookie season, Nagler set the Cardinals team record for receptions in a rookie season, with 43. Nagler missed the 1954 NFL season due to military service. While posted at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, Nagler helped coach the base football team to a perfect 12-0 record and the All-Service Championship, winning the 1954 Poinsettia Bowl. He returned to the Cardinals in 1955, spending the next four seasons with the club. Nagler earned a Pro Bowl selection in 1958. Following his Pro Bowl year, Nagler was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers and spent one season with the team. He was moved to the Cleveland Browns as part of a four-player New Year's Eve trade that included Steelers quarterback Len Dawson. Nagler finished his playing career after the 1961 NFL season, after two seasons with the Browns. Nagler was involved with the early efforts to organize a players' union, and was a key figure in the creation of the first players' pension. Nagler and Cleveland Browns end Billy Howton presented NFL Commissioner Bert Bell with a draft antitrust lawsuit, threatening to file if the NFL did not immediately establish a pension for its players. The gambit worked, and the pension was formally established three years later. Personal Life and Death Following retirement from the NFL, Nagler worked in various aspects of the farming and agriculture industry, splitting time between southern California and the Hillsboro, Oregon area. Nagler was married three times, to Diana Swift (divorced 1975), Barbara Bertolini (1976-1995), and Jan Anacker (1998-2020). He and Diana had three children together. He was inducted into the Santa Clara Hall of Fame in 1987 and the Marysville High School Hall of Fame in 2019. Nagler died in his home in Palm Desert, California on April 9, 2020.

Ming, approximately three years old at the time of his capture, lived semi-openly with his owner, Antoine Yates, in a room of his five-bedroom apartment on the fifth floor of a large public housing complex in Harlem. Several other normal and exotic pets were found in Yates' apartment, including an alligator named Al in another bedroom. Ming spent the rest of his life at Noah's Lost Ark Animal Sanctuary in Berlin Center, Ohio. Ming died from natural causes in February 2019 and was buried at the Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York . History =Early life= In April 2000, Antoine Yates, a 31-year-old part-time taxicab driver and resident of Harlem, New York City, purchased Ming, an 8-week-old male Siberian–Bengal tiger hybrid, from the BEARCAT Hollow Animal Park in Racine, Minnesota. Records indicated that BEARCAT Hollow had previously sold a lion cub to Yates, but he had found another home for the lion shortly after purchasing Ming. =Discovery= Ming's existence became known and reported in the media after Yates went to the Harlem Hospital Center emergency room on September 30, 2003 with bites on the arm and leg. At the time of treatment, Yates claimed that his pet pit bull had bitten him; however, the medical personnel were suspicious, because the width of the bite marks suggested an animal with a much larger jaw. Later, Yates said he had been bitten while trying to keep Ming away from Shadow, a cat he had recently adopted. Yates checked out of the hospital on October 3, and the same day, following up on a tip, an officer of New York City Police Department was sent to his home address to investigate. Loud growling noises could be heard through the door of the apartment, causing the officer to avoid entering. The NYPD Technical Assistance Response Unit drilled holes through a neighbor's walls and used a camera on a pole to locate Ming. Martin Duffy, another police officer was sent to the roof, from which he abseiled on a rope sling to view through the apartment's windows. Ming roared at Duffy, who then anaesthetized Ming by firing a rifle with a tranquilizer dart prepared by the city's Chief Veterinarian, Dr. Robert Cook. After being darted, Ming charged at the window from which Duffy had fired, breaking it, then retreated further into the apartment. Authorities waited several minutes for the sedative to take effect before an animal control team was sent into Yates' apartment. Dr. Cook used a catchpole and gave Ming another sedative injection to ensure he would remain asleep during transport. It took more than six men to carry Ming down via elevator to a waiting truck. The team also discovered Al, a five-and-a-half- foot alligator that Yates had been raising in one of the other bedrooms. Yates was later located at a hospital in Philadelphia and placed under guard. After Ming was discovered in Yates' apartment in October 2003, questioning of the neighbors determined that the existence of the tiger was widely known for at least three years, but as a sort of urban legend. One fact that turned up was that Yates regularly bought large quantities of raw chicken at the local supermarket, and it was a standing joke in the building that he could eat so much chicken every day. By 2003, Yates was feeding Ming of chicken, livers, and bones per day. In addition, Yates had taken roommates, who were unaware at first of the animals in the home. According to the New York Daily News, =Legal actions= Yates was arrested on charges of reckless endangerment and the possession of a wild animal. Later, his mother was charged with endangering the welfare of a child, since she had been babysitting children in the apartment. As part of a plea agreement to reduce charges against his mother, Yates pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment, and eventually served a five-month prison term with five years' probation. He was released after serving three months, and subsequently he sued New York City for the loss of his pets (including a rabbit) and for $7,000 cash which he claimed had also been in the apartment. A judge dismissed the case, calling him full of \\"chutzpah\\". =Life after New York= Authorities decided to move the seized animals to more appropriate housing: Ming was sent to Noah's Lost Ark Animal Sanctuary in Berlin Center, Ohio, while Al was given a new home in Indiana. Around 2010, Yates lived in Pahrump, Nevada near Las Vegas with 22 big cats, including four tigers, having redubbed himself \\"Antoine Tigermann Yates\\". He established the Reach Out And Respond (ROAR) Foundation in 2011. A 2018 article in the New York Post cast doubt on Yates's veracity, noting that a licensed tiger owner in Pahrump stated that Yates had never lived in Nevada. In media In October 2010, the story of Yates and Ming was dramatized on the Animal Planet show Fatal Attractions. The episode was titled \\"A Tiger Loose in Harlem\\". A mix of re-creation and documented footage was used, complete with commentary by Yates, his family and police. Ming is mentioned in the documentary film, The Tiger Next Door.

Early life He was born on 11 December 1926 in Quetta, British India. He was the son of William Church Stacpoole Haycraft (1891–1929), who was a British officer in the colonial Indian army. He was the grandson of John Berry Haycraft and nephew of Sir Thomas Haycraft. His mother was Olive Lillian Esmée (1901–1978). He had one younger brother, Colin Berry Haycraft (1929–1994). His father died when he was still young, killed by one of his soldiers. His mother supported her family on a small army pension and worked as a tennis player. Education He studied at Wellington, in Berkshire, where he showed his natural leadership qualities and became head boy. Later with his brother they came back to Britain, where they both studied at Oxford University - John matriculated from Jesus College in 1948 and obtained a second-class degree in modern history in 1951. Colin Haycraft became a famous editor and married Ann Margaret Lindholm, a writer and essayist. After a postgraduate course at Yale, he was a tourist guide in Toledo and gave private English lessons. International House World Organisation The main creation of John Haycraft is International House World Organisation. It was started by John and his wife Brita Haycraft in Córdoba in 1953. A fervent internationalist, John strove to promote international understanding through language learning and teacher training. They were teaching and writing there from 1953 until 1959. This period he described in his autobiographical book Babel in Spain (1965). In 1959 he returned to London. There he worked with his wife on his ideas such as raising the standards of the teaching of English and the practical training of teachers for the classroom. He wanted to set up intensive teacher-training courses to prepare people for multi-lingual classes. In 1974 they set up a non-profit- making educational trust committed to raising the standards of English language teaching and training worldwide. International House Trust trades today as International House London. He retired from International House in 1990. After that he decided start a project with the financier George Soros in order to establish schools in Central and Eastern Europe. When he died on 23 May 1996, he left behind a network of 100 schools that grew from the first school in Córdoba in Spain to cover 40 countries.

Falkenberg (Falkenbergshus) was a fort located at Falkenberg in Halland County, Sweden. The fortfication was located on the south strand of the river Ätran, about from the southern abutment of Falkenberg Bridge. It would later give name to the town of Falkenberg which was previously known as Ätraby. History Falkenberg was first mentioned in 1298. In the early part of the 13th century the province of Halland was part of Denmark. The Danish kings had built a fortification on the east shore of the Ätran river in the community of Falkenberg. The fort was the site for several Nordic treaties during the fourteenth century. It was burnt down by Count Erik Magnusson (c. 1282 – 1318) in 1356 during his revolt against his father King Magnus IV of Sweden. The fortification was thereafter rebuilt. The army of Swedish rebel leader Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson (1390s–1436) besiege the town in 1434, under the leadership of Herman Berman. The action took place during the Engelbrekt rebellion against King Eric of Pomerania. The defenders managed the first attack successfully. They did however realise that they would not be able to continue to hold the fort. Therefore, they choose to put the fort on fire and leave it by water. The fort was destroyed and was not rebuilt. Excavations took place in 1885, as a railway was run through the area. The fort consisted of a tower. It had an inner area of , while the outer area was at the base. The walls are at the thickest at the base, and becomes thinner towards the top. Above the lower, partially intact, parts were brick walls.

Early life John O. Pickett Jr. grew up in Texarkana, Texas, on a ranch owned by his parents, John Olen Pickett Sr. (1908–1971) and Anna Mae (Gill) Pickett (1911–1999), and later attended the University of Arkansas. Pickett moved to Long Island after earning his fortune as a private investor. He owned management-consultant firms in Chicago and Palm Beach and first became interested in hockey after attending New York Rangers games during business trips to New York during the late 1950s. Islanders ownership and dynasty years John Pickett was originally a limited partner in the original Islanders' ownership group, headed by Roy Boe. He purchased a small share in the team for $100,000 in 1972 at the request of Boe, who was then a casual acquaintance. However, by 1978, the Islanders were sinking under the weight of serious financial problems, and Boe was forced to put them up for sale. No buyers turned up at first, however. Finally, general manager Bill Torrey engineered a sale to Pickett, a restructuring specialist, who rewarded him with the team presidency. Pickett restructured the team's finances with a view towards making them a viable long-term franchise on suburban Long Island. Not long after closing on the Islanders' purchase, Pickett signed a very lucrative cable contract with the then-one-year-old SportsChannel New York (later Fox Sports New York and now MSG Plus). The deal not only ensured the Islanders would stay on Long Island, but gave Pickett a significant revenue stream which he used to sign the final pieces for a team that would go on to win four consecutive Stanley Cups in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983. Pickett attempted to sell Charles Dolan a 36 percent share in the Islanders in 1981, but the sale was blocked by a lawsuit from four minority owners who accused Pickett of undervaluing the team and trying to sell their shares without their consent. Believing the lawsuit to be a distraction from the team's performance on the ice, Pickett called off the deal. During the Islanders' dynasty years, the team was a model franchise in professional sports, emulated for its formula of supportive ownership and building through the draft. During its championship years under Pickett, the team was the highest paying organization in hockey, with stars like Bryan Trottier, Mike Bossy, Denis Potvin and Billy Smith at or near top of the league in compensation by position. During this period, Pickett was a very hands-off owner who shied away from media attention, instead focusing accolades on the players and coaches. He largely left the Islanders in Torrey's hands and rarely interfered. All the while, Pickett was one of the most influential owners in the National Hockey League during this period, driving NHL policy along with League President John A. Ziegler Jr. Decline and aborted sales In 1985, after signing a new lease that would keep the Islanders in Nassau Coliseum for another 30 years, Pickett moved to Florida to focus on other business interests and severely cut back his involvement in the team's day-to-day operations. During the second half of the 1980s, despite significant revenue from their long-term Cablevision contract, the team's strategy of building through the draft began to yield less on-ice success. Additionally, Pickett was accused of keeping a majority of the $12 million in annual revenue from the cable deal rather than reinvest it back in the team. Despite superstars like Pat LaFontaine, the team suffered from a succession of unsuccessful draft picks, and performance declined. The bottom fell out in 1988-89, when the Islanders tied for the worst record in the league and missed the playoffs altogether for the first time in 15 years. The Islanders continued to struggle, and Pickett's ownership and budgeting of the team came under fire in early 1991 when star player Pat LaFontaine asked to be traded after negotiations on a team-initiated contract extension broke down. LaFontaine eventually refused to negotiate with general manager Bill Torrey and demanded Pickett's ouster as owner. Pickett initially declared his allegiance to the Islanders, but by late February he had officially put the team up for sale and indicated his desire to obtain an NHL expansion franchise closer to his home in Florida. He had hoped to sell the Islanders quickly, but by the beginning of the 1991-92 season they still had not been sold. LaFontaine, who refused to report to the team, was joined in his request for a trade by team captain Brent Sutter, and both would be traded away by Torrey in separate deals shortly after the start of the season. In December 1991, aware of the limitations of his absentee ownership but still unable to find an outright buyer willing to pay his $75 million price tag, Pickett attempted to re-establish local management of the Islanders by selling a minority stake in the team to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs – Ralph Palleschi, Bob Rosenthal, Stephen Walsh and Paul Greenwood. As part of the sale, Pickett gave them operating control of the team. The group was deeply rooted in the Long Island business environment and it was hoped that their involvement would be an alternative to Pickett selling the team outright. On August 18, 1992, it was announced that Cablevision chairman Charles Dolan, who had first attempted to acquire an interest in the Islanders over ten years earlier, had reached an agreement to purchase the team from John Pickett. However, the two sides were never able to complete the sale and a year later the deal expired, with Pickett retaining majority control of the team. The \\"Gang of Four\\" minority owners continued to run the team, but after missing the playoffs five times in seven years, and with the committee making deeply unpopular decisions such as a change of logo, Pickett finally wanted out for good. He again put the team up for sale in 1996, and appointed his son Brett Pickett to oversee the sale and operation of the franchise. Pickett thought he found a buyer in John Spano, a Dallas leasing agent seemingly flush with cash. With league commissioner Gary Bettman brokering the deal, Pickett reached an agreement to sell the team to Spano in October 1996. However, in June 1997, after Spano missed several payments on his purchase contract, Bettman ordered him to relinquish day-to-day control of the team to Pickett until the dispute was resolved. A month later, Newsday started investigating Spano after several Islanders executives alerted the paper that something was amiss about their new boss.Mullen, Holly. Meltdown man. Dallas Observer, 1997-07-31. That investigation led to a story that revealed Spano had lied to Pickett and the NHL about his net worth and resources to complete the transaction, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of that story running, Spano relinquished the team to Pickett. A federal investigation revealed that Spano had forged many of the documents he'd used to vouch for his wealth and promise payment to Pickett, and had even been brazen enough to fax many of these forged documents from his own office. Spano was ultimately sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. Sale to Gluckstern group Following the Spano fraud, and after several years of trying to find a buyer, Pickett finally sold the Islanders to a group headed by Phoenix Coyotes co- owner Steven Gluckstern and New York City real estate developer Howard Millstein in September 1997. Having thought to have found an ownership team committed to the team's future on Long Island, Pickett fully retired quietly to Florida.

Hereinafter cited as Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, 107th edition. Sir Richard Fiennes was the hereditary keeper of Herstmonceaux Castle, an office which descended in the Fiennes family until the execution of the ninth baron. By patent of 7 November 1458, King Henry VI of England accepted him as Lord Dacre, and by two writs in 1459 and 1482 Fiennes was summoned to Parliament as Baron Dacre. In 1473 the King made the final award of the lands of the sixth Baron Dacre between the heir male, Humphrey Dacre, the younger of Joan's two surviving uncles; and the heir general, Richard Fiennes, in right of his wife Joan Dacre, who had succeeded to the suo jure title on 5 January 1458. Most of the estates went to the heir male with remainder to the heir general while the peerage went to Richard Fiennes in right of his wife. Peerage lawyers have claimed that Richard Fiennes's summons to parliament created a new barony; for, though his wife was a peeress in her own right, his summons was not a courtesy one. J. Horace Round held that the award of 1473 assigning the heir general and her husband precedence of the old barony, over that of the heir male, was a recognition of his wife's accession to the original barony.

Early history Andrew Carnegie donated $25,000 to establish a public library in Charlotte in 1901. In early 1904, the city aldermen bought a lot at the corner of Brevard and East 2nd streets for a separate library for African Americans, the first of its kind in North Carolina.Cristina Bolling, \\"Our living history: spreading the joy of books,\\" Charlotte Observer, Feb. 15, 2005, p.1B Although only six blocks from the Carnegie Library, it was in the heart of the Brooklyn neighborhood, the black city within the city of Charlotte where many black churches and most black-owned businesses and professional offices were located. It operated independently at first and after 1929 as a branch of the public library system before closing in 1961. Growth of the Library System The library system and the region grew tremendously in this period. The new, architecturally modern Main Library expanded its services to include a Carolina Room for local history and genealogy. In 1956, the library stopped segregating its customers by race and opened its services to all on an equal basis. Under the leadership of, among others, Robert E. Cannon (1986-2003), the library added more branches, inaugurated a literary festival, remodeled the 1956 Main Library building, and brought its catalog online. It continued to grow into the 21st century, constructing the ImaginOn branch as a joint venture with the Children's Theatre of Charlotte.http://cmlibrary.org/library- history The Modern Library The economic recession of 2009-2011 brought significant budget reductions, resulting in employee layoffs, the closure of four library branches, reduced hours and services at all remaining locations, and the consolidation of several support functions with Mecklenburg County. But it was from this challenging time that the Library, County and community leaders found new ways to collaborate to meet the mutual goal of providing Mecklenburg County residents with the resources they needed to be successful. Today the Library's 20 locations include a Main Library, an innovative library for children and teens called ImaginOn, and a network of branch libraries throughout Mecklenburg County. Throughout the system, the Library provides free and open access to its physical and electronic collections and information, as well as to its services for people of all ages, from toddlers to teens to adults.

History As an artistic institution dedicated exclusively to concert activities, The Cluj-Napoca Philharmonic was founded through an official decree of Romania’s Council of Ministers, in the autumn of 1955, carrying the name \\"The Transylvania State Philharmonic Cluj-Napoca\\". At that time, the symphonic orchestra had 75 musicians and the ensemble of traditional music had 20 members. Under the supervision of Maestro Wilhelm Demian, the members of the new institution were selected. Maestro Antonin Ciolan was appointed principal conductor of the symphonic ensemble. The first concert took place on December 4, 1955. Nonetheless, the tradition of symphonic activity in Cluj-Napoca has its history since the beginning of the 19th century, maintained by associations like The Orchestra of the Cluj-Napoca National Theatre, Music Society and Music Circle. During the inter-war period, there ware series of symphonic events, sustained by the orchestras of the Cluj-Napoca Romanian Opera, Hungarian Theatre and by an orchestra belonging to the city’s Jewish community, called \\"Goldmark Orchestra\\". In 1947, there was the first attempt to found a concert institution – The \\"Ardealul\\" Philharmonic, which had a short existence of two seasons, but which set the basis for what the cultural life in Cluj-Napoca was to become. Due to Maestro Ciolan’s experience and the training of the young musicians from the Music Academy in Cluj-Napoca (called the Music Conservatory at that time), the Philharmonic’s progress was extremely fast. It soon became an important name among the national artistic values. In 1966, the Chamber Orchestra was founded, under the baton of the well-known Mircea Cristescu. In 1965, the Philharmonic organized the first edition of its own yearly festival, Cluj Musical Autumn. In 1972, under the composer Sigismund Toduță’s directorship, the Philharmonic’s Choir was founded and trained by Maestro Dorin Pop, followed by Florentin Mihăescu and Cornel Groza.

In the meantime, excitement and dissatisfaction were steadily growing among the population, and strict measures were necessary for the maintenance of order. On 11 September, martial law was proclaimed, following the revolt of 8,000 troops and their officers in Thessaloniki, who sent word to Athens demanding the abdication of King Constantine and the imprisonment of the former prime ministers, Dimitrios Gounaris and Nikolaos Stratos. This revolt was followed by a widespread rebellion of troops evacuated from Asia Minor to the islands of Mytilene, Chios, and Crete. The army contingents in Mytilene formed a Revolutionary Committee headed by Colonel Stylianos Gonatas, which despatched by aeroplane the following demands to Athens: the dismissal of the government, the dissolution of the parliament, the holding of new elections, and the abdication of King Constantine in favour of the Crown Prince, Crown Prince George. The revolutionary movement swiftly spread to other centres of Greece and to the Greek gunboats stationed at Mytilene and in and about the port of Piraeus.

If a type A or type B free agent signs with a team that the player did not finish the previous season with, his former team will receive a sandwich pick for the departed player. As well as the sandwich pick, type A free agents will also net their former team a forfeited pick from the signing team. The forfeited pick is generally the signing team's 1st round draft choice; however, there are certain factors which could result in a different round for the pick. In order for the team to receive a compensation pick, the free agent must be offered arbitration or be signed by their new team prior to the arbitration deadline. The order of the supplemental picks is determined by the Elias ranking of each signed free agent.

It was likely a reemergence of the mid-6th-century Plague of Justinian. Called after Amwas in Palestine, the principal camp of the Muslim Arab army, the plague killed up to 25,000 soldiers and their relatives, including most of the army's high command, and caused considerable loss of life and displacement among the indigenous Christians of Syria. The appointment of Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan to the governorship of Syria in the wake of the commanders' deaths paved the way for his establishment of the Umayyad Caliphate in 661, while recurrences of the disease may have contributed to the Umayyad dynasty's downfall in 750. Depopulation in the Syrian countryside may have been a factor in the resettlement of the land by the Arabs unlike in other conquered regions where the Arabs largely secluded themselves to new garrison cities. The plague of Amwas received more attention in the Arabic sources than any other epidemic until the 14th-century Black Death. Traditional narratives about reactions to the plague of Amwas by Caliph Umar and his top commander Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah informed medieval Muslim theological responses to epidemics, including the Black Death. Principles derived from the narratives were cited in debates about predestination and free will, prohibitions on fleeing or entering plague-affected lands and contagion. Origins and political setting The site of Emmaus-Nicopolis, called 'Amwas' by the Arabs. The plague of Amwas first struck the Muslim Arab troops encamped there before spreading across Syria–Palestine and affecting Egypt and Iraq The plague of Amwas (ta'un Amwas in Arabic) was likely a bubonic plague epidemic, though the sources do not elaborate on specific symptoms of the disease. It was the second recorded plague of the Islamic era, which began in the 620s, and the first to directly afflict the Muslims. It was likely a reemergence of the Plague of Justinian, which originated in Pelusium (near modern Suez) in 541 CE and spread west to Alexandria and east to Palestine before reaching the Byzantine capital Constantinople in 541–542 and afflicting the rest of Europe and the Sasanian Empire, as noted by the Byzantine historian Procopius (d. ). The Plague of Justinian recurred in at least nine to twelve cycles throughout the mid-6th century and the 7th century. The first caliph (head of the Muslim community) Abu Bakr () dispatched four armies from Medina led respectively by Amr ibn al-As, Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan, Shurahbil ibn Hasana and Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah to conquer Byzantine Syria (Abu Ubayda may not have been dispatched until after the accession of Abu Bakr's successor Caliph Umar in mid-634). Amwas, the Arabic name for Emmaus-Nicopolis, had been a fortified Roman army camp in the 1st century CE, which grew into a small city by the early 3rd century. It was captured by the Muslims from the Byzantines following the Battle of Ajnadayn in 634 or the Battle of Yarmouk in 636. At the onset of the plague, the site served as the principal camp of the Arab Muslim troops in Syria where spoils were divided and soldiers paid. Chronology The plague of Amwas occurred in the Islamic calendar years of 17 AH/638 CE and/or 18 AH/639 CE. According to the 8th-century historian Sayf ibn Umar, it struck in Muharram–Safar 17 AH/January–February 638, then dissipated before returning once more and inflicting numerous deaths \\"to the advantage of the enemy [the Byzantines].\\" Al-Suyuti (d. 1505) holds the plague had reemerged not long after its initial outbreak, which Dols suggests \\"accounts for the two dates [638 and 639]\\". The plague struck at some point during a nine-month drought in Syria referred to by the Arabs as the 'Year of the Ashes'. Widespread famine in Syria–Palestine possibly set the stage for the plague due to weakened immune resistance and the stockpiling of food reserves in towns and villages, which could attract plague-infected rodents and bring them into contact with the human population, according to Dols. It spread across Syria and also affected Iraq and Egypt, before subsiding in Shawwal 18 AH/ October 639. Consequences =Response and immediate impact= Syria toward the end of the Muslim conquest of the region from the Byzantine Empire, According to one of the main narratives of the Islamic traditional sources, Umar, intending to prevent the illness and death of his top commander Abu Ubayda, summoned the latter to Medina; Abu Ubayda, aware of Umar's intent, refused to abandon his men. Umar subsequently embarked for Syria to assess the situation, meeting with the army leaders at a desert way-stop called Sargh (thirteen days' march north of Medina). His first consultations were with leaders from the Muhajirun and Ansar factions, collectively the earliest Muslim converts and elite of the nascent Muslim state, who argued against fleeing the plague-affected areas. Disagreeing with their recommendations, he next consulted the leaders of the later converts from the Quraysh, the tribe to which the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the caliphs belonged, who proposed that the army should withdraw from the area of the epidemic, which Umar accepted. Abu Ubayda protested the army's withdrawal on the basis of a purported prohibition by Muhammad on Muslims fleeing or entering a plague-affected land. Umar retorted that a person would naturally choose the green side of a valley rather than the barren side, but regardless of the person's decision it would be God's will. This narrative was used by medieval Muslim scholars as a precedent justifying flight from an epidemic. The summit at Sargh concluded with Umar ordering Abu Ubdaya to lead the army to healthier grounds and the caliph's return to Medina. Abu Ubayda moved to encamp the army at the old Ghassanid capital of Jabiya in the highland region of the Hauran. Due to its healthy climate, Jabiya effectively acted as a sanatorium for plague-stricken troops and the center for the distribution of war spoils. On the way there, in 639, Abu Ubayda succumbed to the plague. His successor Mu'adh ibn Jabal and two of Mu'adh's wives and son (or his entire family) died immediately after, followed by Mu'adh's successor Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan. Shurahbil also died from the plague. Among the other prominent Muslims and companions of Muhammad in the army to succumb were Suhayl ibn Amr, Suhayl's son Abu Jandal, al-Fadl ibn Abbas, al-Harith ibn Hisham, and many of al-Harith's seventy family members who had settled in Syria. Amr ibn al-As is credited for leading the surviving Muslim troops to Jabiya. In December 639, he embarked on the conquest of Egypt, either with Umar's reluctant sanction or without the caliph's authorization. The Islamic traditional accounts maintain between 20,000 and 25,000 Muslim soldiers in Syria and their family members died in the plague. By 639, 4,000 Muslim troops were left in Jabiya out of some 24,000 in 637, though the modern historian Fred Donner notes that it is unclear how many of the missing troops had died or had temporarily fled and returned to Syria eventually. The plague caused substantial loss of life among the local Christian population in Syria. It also resulted in price rises and hoarding, prompting Umar to prohibit hoarding. According to al-Tabari (d. 923), after returning to Medina from Sargh, Umar informed his advisers of his intention to visit his troops in Syria–Palestine and assess the chaos wrought by the plague. During his purported visit in 639, he gave directions on the disposition of the estates of the Muslims who died in the epidemic and settled suspicious claims by some of the troops. =Long-term political and societal effects= As a result of the deaths of his top commanders in Syria, Umar appointed Yazid's brother and deputy, Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, commander of the army there, ultimately laying the foundation for the establishment of the Syria-centered Umayyad Caliphate by Mu'awiya in 661. The historian Wilferd Madelung surmises that the plague in Syria had precluded Umar from deploying commanders more preferable to him from Medina and he thus appointed Mu'awiya in lieu of a suitable alternative. The losses among the Muslim troops in Syria caused by the Amwas plague contributed to Mu'awiya's heavy military reliance on older-established, formerly Byzantine-allied and Christian Arab tribes in Syria, particularly the Banu Kalb, who had largely stayed neutral during the fighting between the Muslims and the Byzantines in Syria during the 630s. The heavy toll on the indigenous Christian population and increased emigration from Syria as a result of the plague of Amwas may have been a contributing factor in the increased settlement of Syria by the Arabs and their penetration of local society during Umayyad rule (640s–750). According to the historian Lawrence Conrad, the Arabs, relying on revenue from the poll tax collected from the non-Arabs in the conquered regions, may not have intended to settle Syria, but were forced to repopulate the deserted countryside in the aftermath of the plague. The policy of settling Arab tribesmen on the land proved exceptional; in other conquered areas, such as Iraq, early Arab settlement was mostly confined to newly built garrison cities. Amwas was replaced as the Arabs' headquarters in Palestine first by Lydda and/or Jerusalem, followed by Ramla, which was founded by the Umayyad caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik in the early 8th century. As late as the 1870s a well in the village of Amwas bore the name bir al-ta'un (well of the plague). Jabiya remained the Arabs' principal military camp in Syria until the reign of Sulayman. Recurrences Rusafa, the desert palace which served as Caliph Hisham's preferred residence in times of plague. The Umayyad caliphs routinely withdrew from Syria's cities to their Syrian desert palaces during recurrences of the plague epidemic. There were recurrences of the plague in Syria–Palestine about every decade between 688/89 and 744/45. \\"The Umaiyad [sic] dynasty was literally plagued by this disease\\", in the words of Dols. The deaths of the Umayyad caliphs Mu'awiya II (), Marwan I (), Abd al-Malik (), Sulayman () and the Umayyad governors in Iraq al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba () and Ziyad ibn Abihi () may all possibly have been caused by the plague epidemics in Syria and Iraq. The caliphs routinely withdrew from the cities to their desert palaces when the plague emerged during the summer months. Notable among them was Caliph Hisham (), who preferred his palace at Rusafa over Damascus because he viewed the latter to be unhealthy. Dols speculates that the frequent recurrences may have consistently undercut natural population growth in Syria–Palestine, the center of the Umayyad Caliphate, and weakened Umayyad power. Concurrently, Arab tribal migrations into the far eastern province of Khurasan, which was apparently spared from the plague epidemics, may have led to the lopsided growth and predominance of the eastern half of the Caliphate and the rise of the Abbasid Movement there, which ultimately toppled the Umayyads in 750. In the view of Conrad, by the end of these plague cycles, the Umayyads has lost practical control of the eastern Caliphate and \\"it is tempting to view the interminable plagues of the last years of the dynasty as an important factor in the victory of the Abbasid revolution\\". =Theological interpretations= Modern historians concur that the actual circumstances of the plague of Amwas are not reconstructable and largely focus on the descriptions of the event in the 8th–10th-century Islamic histories and collections of hadith (traditions and sayings of Muhammad) in the context of theological debates on predestination, the status of Muslim sinners, and contagion. The plague of Amwas received more attention in medieval Arabic literature than any other epidemic until the 14th-century Black Death. Representations of the plague by the sources were \\"varied and contradictory\\", according to the historian Justin K. Stearns. The narratives of the response to the plague by Muhammad's companions Umar, Abu Ubayda, Amr and Mu'adh informed Muslim religious and legal interpretations of plague throughout the Middle Ages, including the response to the Black Death. Medieval Muslim scholars derived three principals from the contemporary reactions to the plague of Amwas: the first was that the plague was a form of divine mercy or martyrdom for the Muslim faithful and a punishment to non-believers; the second was the prohibition on Muslims entering or fleeing plague-stricken lands; and the third was the plague was not a contagion, rather it was directly imposed by God. The tenets consistently caused theological disagreements throughout the epidemic recurrences of the Middle Ages as a result of the difficulty in accepting plague as divine mercy or punishment and observable contagion. In the assessment of Dols, native Christian and Jewish attitudes and natural human anxieties likely influenced aspects of the first principle, namely that plague represented divine punishment or warnings. Muslims in this camp related the plague to lax morals among the Muslim troops in Syria, such as the consumption of wine, which supposedly led Umar to order the lashing of drinkers. On the other hand, the interpretation of plague as mercy or martyrdom is evident in Abu Ubayda's speeches to the troops at Amwas and in the council at Sargh. A poem about the plague of Amwas recorded by the Damascene historian Ibn Asakir (d. 1175) reflects the martyrdom belief: > How many brave horsemen and how many beautiful, chaste women were killed in > the valley of 'Amwas > They had encountered the Lord, but He was not unjust to them > When they died, they were among the non-aggrieved people in Paradise. > We endure the plague as the Lord knows, and we were consoled in the hour of > death. On the principle of predestination, the events of Amwas were used to argue that whether a person fled or remained in a plague-affected area their death had already been decreed by God. During an episode of plague in the Iraqi garrison city of Kufa, the prominent statesman and scholar Abu Musa al-Ash'ari (d. 662) turned away visitors to his home due to someone in his household having the plague, and he justified Muslims fleeing plague on the basis of Umar's actions at Sargh. According to Dols, this also implied a recognition of contagion despite the contradiction with the purported hadith rejecting contagion as a pre-Islamic theory.

Zobel networks are a type of filter section based on the image-impedance design principle. They are named after Otto Zobel of Bell Labs, who published a much-referenced paper on image filters in 1923.Zobel, O. J., Theory and Design of Uniform and Composite Electric Wave Filters, Bell System Technical Journal, Vol. 2 (1923), pp. 1-46. The distinguishing feature of Zobel networks is that the input impedance is fixed in the design independently of the transfer function. This characteristic is achieved at the expense of a much higher component count compared to other types of filter sections. The impedance would normally be specified to be constant and purely resistive. For this reason, Zobel networks are also known as constant resistance networks. However, any impedance achievable with discrete components is possible. Zobel networks were formerly widely used in telecommunications to flatten and widen the frequency response of copper land lines, producing a higher performance line from one originally intended for ordinary telephone use. Analogue technology has given way to digital technology and they are now little used. When used to cancel out the reactive portion of loudspeaker impedance, the design is sometimes called a Boucherot cell. In this case, only half the network is implemented as fixed components, the other half being the real and imaginary components of the loudspeaker impedance. This network is more akin to the power factor correction circuits used in electrical power distribution, hence the association with Boucherot's name. A common circuit form of Zobel networks is in the form of a bridged T network. This term is often used to mean a Zobel network, sometimes incorrectly when the circuit implementation is not a bridged T. BBC engineers equalising audio landlines circa 1959. The boxes with two large black dials towards the top of the equipment racks are adjustable Zobel equalisers. They are used both for temporary outside broadcast lines and for checking the engineer's calculations prior to building permanent units __TOC__ Derivation Zobel network as a balanced bridge The basis of a Zobel network is a balanced bridge circuit as shown in the circuit to the right. The condition for balance is that; : \\\\frac{Z}{Z_0} = \\\\frac{Z_0}{Z'} If this is expressed in terms of a normalised Z0 = 1 as is conventionally done in filter tables, then the balance condition is simply; : Z = \\\\frac{1}{Z'} Or, \\\\scriptstyle Z' is simply the inverse, or dual impedance of \\\\scriptstyle Z. The bridging impedance ZB is across the balance points and hence has no potential across it. Consequently, it will draw no current and its value makes no difference to the function of the circuit. Its value is often chosen to be Z0 for reasons which will become clear in the discussion of bridged T circuits further on. =Input impedance= The input impedance is given by : \\\\frac{1}{Z_\\\\text{in}} = \\\\frac{1}{Z_0 + Z'} + \\\\frac{1}{Z + Z_0} Substituting the balance condition, : Z' = \\\\frac{Z_0^2}{Z} yields : Z_\\\\text{in} = Z_0 The input impedance can be designed to be purely resistive by setting : Z_0 = R_0\\\\\\\\!\\\\, The input impedance will then be real and independent of ω in band and out of band no matter what complexity of filter section is chosen. =Transfer function= Equivalent circuit of a Zobel network for calculating gain If the Z0 in the bottom right of the bridge is taken to be the output load then a transfer function of Vo/Vin can be calculated for the section. Only the rhs branch needs to be considered in this calculation. The reason for this can be seen by considering that there is no current flow through ZB. None of the current flowing through the lhs branch is going to flow into the load. The lhs branch therefore, cannot possibly affect the output. It certainly affects the input impedance (and hence the input terminal voltage) but not the transfer function. The transfer function can now easily be seen to be; : A(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{Z_0}{Z + Z_0} =Bridged T implementation= Zobel bridged T implementation The load impedance is actually the impedance of the following stage or of a transmission line and can sensibly be omitted from the circuit diagram. If we also set; : Z_B = Z_0\\\\,\\\\\\\\! then the circuit to the right results. This is referred to as a bridged T circuit because the impedance Z is seen to \\"bridge\\" across the T section. The purpose of setting ZB = Z0 is to make the filter section symmetrical. This has the advantage that it will then present the same impedance, Z0, at both the input and the output port. Types of section A Zobel filter section can be implemented for low-pass, high- pass, band-pass or band-stop. It is also possible to implement a flat frequency response attenuator. This last is of some importance for the practical filter sections described later. =Attenuator= Z and Z' for a Zobel attenuator For an attenuator section, Z is simply : Z = R\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and, : Z' = R' = \\\\frac{R_0^2}{R} The attenuation of the section is given by; : L = 20\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{R}{R_0} + 1\\\\right)\\\\, \\\\text{dB} =Low pass= Z and Z ' for a Zobel low-pass filter section For a low-pass filter section, Z is an inductor and Z ' is a capacitor; : Z = i \\\\omega L\\\\\\\\!\\\\, and : Z' = \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\omega C'} where : C' = \\\\frac{L}{R_0^2} The transfer function of the section is given by : A(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{R_0}{i \\\\omega L + R_0} The 3 dB point occurs when ωL = R0 so the 3 dB cut-off frequency is given by : \\\\omega_c = \\\\frac{R_0}{L} where ω is in the stop band well above ωc, : A(\\\\omega) \\\\approx \\\\frac{R_0}{i \\\\omega L} it can be seen from this that A(ω) is falling away in the stop band at the classic 6 dB/8ve (or 20 dB/decade). =High pass= Z and Z' for a Zobel high-pass filter section For a high-pass filter section, Z is a capacitor and Z' is an inductor: : Z = \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\omega C} and : Z' = i \\\\omega L' \\\\\\\\!\\\\, where : L' = CR_0^2 \\\\\\\\!\\\\, The transfer function of the section is given by : A(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{i \\\\omega C R_0}{1 + i \\\\omega C R_0} The 3 dB point occurs when ωC = so the 3 dB cut-off frequency is given by : \\\\omega_c = \\\\frac{1}{C R_0} In the stop band, : A(\\\\omega) \\\\approx i \\\\omega C R_0 falling at 6 dB/8ve with decreasing frequency. =Band pass= Z and Z' for a Zobel band-pass filter section For a band-pass filter section, Z is a series resonant circuit and Z' is a shunt resonant circuit; : Z = i \\\\omega L + \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\omega C} and : Y' = \\\\frac{1}{Z'} = i \\\\omega C' + \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\omega L'} The transfer function of the section is given by : A(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{i \\\\omega C R_0}{1 + i \\\\omega C R_0 - \\\\omega^2 LC} The 3 dB point occurs when 1 − ω2LC = ωCR0 so the 3 dB cut-off frequencies are given by : \\\\omega_c = \\\\frac{1}{2LC}\\\\left(\\\\pm R_0 C + \\\\sqrt{R_0^2C^2 + 4LC}\\\\right) from which the centre frequency, ωm, and bandwidth, Δω, can be determined: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta\\\\omega &= \\\\frac{R_0}{L}  \\\\omega_m &= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{R_0^2}{4 L^2} + \\\\frac{1}{LC}} \\\\end{align} Note that this is different from the resonant frequency : \\\\omega_0 = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{LC}} the relationship between them being given by : \\\\omega_m^2 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\omega}{2}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\omega_0^2 =Band stop= Z and Z' for a Zobel band-stop filter section For a band-stop filter section, Z is a shunt resonant circuit and Z' is a series resonant circuit: : Y = \\\\frac{1}{Z}= i \\\\omega C + \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\omega L} and : Z' = i \\\\omega L' + \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\omega C'} The transfer function and bandwidth can be found by analogy with the band-pass section. : \\\\Delta\\\\omega = \\\\frac{1}{C R_0} And, : \\\\omega_m = \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2 R_0 C}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{1}{LC}} Practical sections A transparent mask used to aid design of Zobel networks. The mask is laid over a plot of the line response and the component values corresponding to the closest fitting curve can be chosen. This particular mask is for high-pass sections. Zobel networks are rarely used for traditional frequency filtering. Other filter types are significantly more efficient for this purpose. Where Zobels come into their own is in frequency equalisation applications, particularly on transmission lines. The difficulty with transmission lines is that the impedance of the line varies in a complex way across the band and is tedious to measure. For most filter types, this variation in impedance will cause a significant difference in response to the theoretical, and is mathematically difficult to compensate for, even assuming that the impedance is known precisely. If Zobel networks are used however, it is only necessary to measure the line response into a fixed resistive load and then design an equaliser to compensate it. It is entirely unnecessary to know anything at all about the line impedance as the Zobel network will present exactly the same impedance to line as the measuring instruments. Its response will therefore be precisely as theoretically predicted. This is a tremendous advantage where high quality lines with flat frequency responses are desired. =Basic loss= A practical high pass section incorporating basic loss used to correct high end roll-off For audio lines, it is invariably necessary to combine L/C filter components with resistive attenuator components in the same filter section. The reason for this is that the usual design strategy is to require the section to attenuate all frequencies down to the level of the frequency in the passband with the lowest level. Without the resistor components, the filter, at least in theory, would increase attenuation without limit. The attenuation in the stop band of the filter (that is, the limiting maximum attenuation) is referred to as the \\"basic loss\\" of the section. In other words, the flat part of the band is attenuated by the basic loss down to the level of the falling part of the band which it is desired to equalise. The following discussion of practical sections relates in particular to audio transmission lines. =6 dB/octave roll-off= High-pass Zobel network response for various basic losses. Normalised to \\\\scriptstyle R_0 \\\\;=\\\\; 1 and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\omega_c \\\\;=\\\\; 1 The most significant effect that needs to be compensated for is that at some cut-off frequency the line response starts to roll-off like a simple low-pass filter. The effective bandwidth of the line can be increased with a section that is a high-pass filter matching this roll- off, combined with an attenuator. In the flat part of the pass-band only the attenuator part of the filter section is significant. This is set at an attenuation equal to the level of the highest frequency of interest. All frequencies up to this point will then be equalised flat to an attenuated level. Above this point, the output of the filter will again start to roll- off. =Mismatched lines= Quite commonly in telecomms networks, a circuit is made up of two sections of line which do not have the same characteristic impedance. For instance 150 Ω and 300 Ω. One effect of this is that the roll- off can start at 6 dB/octave at an initial cut-off frequency \\\\scriptstyle f_{c1}, but then at \\\\scriptstyle f_{c2} can become suddenly steeper. This situation then requires (at least) two high-pass sections to compensate each operating at a different \\\\scriptstyle f_c. =Bumps and dips= Bumps and dips in the passband can be compensated for with band-stop and band-pass sections respectively. Again, an attenuator element is also required, but usually rather smaller than that required for the roll-off. These anomalies in the pass-band can be caused by mismatched line segments as described above. Dips can also be caused by ground temperature variations. =Transformer roll- off= Low frequency equaliser section with compensation for inductor resistance. The resistance r represents the stray resistance of the non-ideal inductor. The resistance r' is a real resistor calculated to compensate for r. Occasionally, a low-pass section is included to compensate for excessive line transformer roll-off at the low frequency end. However, this effect is usually very small compared to the other effects noted above. Low frequency sections will usually have inductors of high values. Such inductors have many turns and consequently tend to have significant resistance. In order to keep the section constant resistance at the input, the dual branch of the bridge T must contain a dual of the stray resistance, that is, a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Even with the compensation, the stray resistance still has the effect of inserting attenuation at low frequencies. This in turn has the effect of slightly reducing the amount of LF lift the section would otherwise have produced. The basic loss of the section can be increased by the same amount as the stray resistance is inserting and this will return the LF lift achieved to that designed for. Compensation of inductor resistance is not such an issue at high frequencies were the inductors will tend to be smaller. In any case, for a high-pass section the inductor is in series with the basic loss resistor and the stray resistance can merely be subtracted from that resistor. On the other hand, the compensation technique may be required for resonant sections, especially a high Q resonator being used to lift a very narrow band. For these sections the value of inductors can also be large. =Temperature compensation= An adjustable attenuation high-pass filter can be used to compensate for changes in ground temperature. Ground temperature is very slow varying in comparison to surface temperature. Adjustments are usually only required 2-4 times per year for audio applications. A collection of various designs of temperature compensation equaliser. Some can be adjusted with pluggable links, others require soldering. Adjustment is not very frequent. The internal components of a temperature equaliser. The inductor and capacitor on the right set the frequency at which the equaliser starts to operate, the banks of selectable resistors on the left set the basic loss and hence amount of equalisation. Typical filter chain An example of a typical chain of Zobel networks being used for line equalisation A typical complete filter will consist of a number of Zobel sections for roll-off, frequency dips and temperature followed by a flat attenuator section to bring the level down to a standard attenuation. This is followed by a fixed gain amplifier to bring the signal back up to a usable level, typically . The gain of the amplifier is usually at most . Any more and the amplification of line noise will tend to cancel out the quality benefits of improved bandwidth. This limit on amplification essentially limits how much the bandwidth can be increased by these techniques. No one part of the incoming signal band will be amplified by the full . The is made up of the line loss in the flat part of its spectrum plus the basic loss of each section. In general, each section will be minimum loss at a different frequency band, hence the amplification in that band will be limited to the basic loss of just that one filter section, assuming insignificant overlap. A typical choice for R0 is 600 Ω. A good quality transformer (usually essential, but not shown on the diagram), known as a repeating coil, is at the beginning of the chain where the line terminates. Other section implementations Besides the Bridged T, there are a number of other possible section forms that can be used. =L-sections= Open circuit derived Zobel L-section for a high-pass section with basic loss Short circuit derived Zobel L-section for a high-pass section with basic loss As mentioned above, \\\\scriptstyle Z_B can be set to any desired impedance without affecting the input impedance. In particular, setting it as either an open circuit or a short circuit results in a simplified section circuit, called L-sections. These are shown above for the case of a high pass section with basic loss. The input port still presents an impedance of \\\\scriptstyle R_0 (provided that the output is terminated in \\\\scriptstyle R_0) but the output port no longer presents a constant impedance. Both the open-circuit and the short-circuit L-sections are capable of being reversed so that \\\\scriptstyle R_0 is then presented at the output and the variable impedance is presented at the input. To retain the benefit of Zobel networks constant impedance, the variable impedance port must not face the line impedance. Nor should it face the variable impedance port of another L-section. Facing the amplifier is acceptable since the input impedance of the amplifier is normally arranged to be \\\\scriptstyle R_0 within acceptable tolerances. In other words, variable impedance must not face variable impedance. A balanced bridged T high-pass full section with basic loss =Balanced bridged T= The Zobel networks described here can be used to equalise land lines composed of twisted pair or star quad cables. The balanced circuit nature of these lines delivers a good common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). To maintain the CMRR, circuits connected to the line should maintain the balance. For this reason, balanced versions of Zobel networks are sometimes required. This is achieved by halving the impedance of the series components and then putting identical components in the return leg of the circuit. A balanced Zobel high-pass short-circuit derived C-section with basic loss =Balanced C-sections= A C-section is a balanced version of an L-section. The balance is achieved in the same way as a balanced full bridged T section by placing half of the series impedance in, what was, the common conductor. C-sections, like the L-section from which they are derived, can come in both open-circuit and short circuit varieties. The same restrictions apply to C-sections regarding impedance terminations as to L-sections. =X-section= It is possible to transform a bridged-T section into a Lattice, or X–section (see Bartlett's bisection theorem).Farago, PS, An Introduction to Linear Network Analysis, The English Universities Press Ltd, 1961, pp117-121. The X-section is a kind of bridge circuit, but usually drawn as a lattice, hence the name. Its topology makes it intrinsically balanced but it is never used to implement the constant resistance filters of the kind described here because of the increased component count. The component count increase arises out of the transformation process rather than the balance. There is however, one common application for this topology, the lattice phase equaliser, which is also constant resistance and also invented by Zobel. This circuit differs from those described here in that the bridge circuit is not generally in the balanced condition. =Half sections= In respect of constant resistance filters, the term half section has a somewhat different meaning to other kinds of image filter. Generally, a half section is formed by cutting through the midpoint of the series impedance and shunt admittance of a full section of a ladder network. It is literally half a section. Here, however, there is a somewhat different definition. A half section is either the series impedance (series half-section) or shunt admittance (shunt half- section) that, when connected between source and load impedances of R0, will result in the same transfer function as some arbitrary constant resistance circuit. The purpose of using half sections is that the same functionality is achieved with a drastically reduced component count. A general Zobel series half section showing the equality of transfer function to an equivalent constant resistance section If a constant resistance circuit has an input Vin, then a generator with an impedance R0 must have an open-circuit voltage of E=2Vin in order to produce Vin at the input of the constant resistance circuit. If now the constant resistance circuit is replaced by an impedance of 2Z, as in the diagram above, it can be seen by simple symmetry that the voltage Vin will appear halfway along the impedance 2Z. The output of this circuit can now be calculated as, :\\\\frac{V_O}{V_{in}} = \\\\frac{R_0}{Z + R_0} which is precisely the same as a bridged T section with series element Z. The series half-section is thus a series impedance of 2Z. By corresponding reasoning, the shunt half-section is a shunt impedance of Z' (or twice the admittance). It must be emphasised that these half sections are far from being constant resistance. They have the same transfer function as a constant resistance network, but only when correctly terminated. An equaliser will not give good results if a half-section is positioned facing the line since the line will have a variable (and probably unknown) impedance. Likewise, two half-sections cannot be connected directly to each other as these both will have variable impedances. However, if a sufficiently large attenuator is placed between the two variable impedances, this will have the effect of masking the effect. A high value attenuator will have an input impedance \\\\scriptstyle \\\\approx R_0 no matter what the terminating impedance on the other side. In the example practical chain shown above there is a 22 dB attenuator required in the chain. This does not need to be at the end of the chain, it can be placed anywhere desired and used to mask two mismatched impedances. It can also be split into two or more parts and used for masking more than one mismatch. Zobel networks and loudspeaker drivers Zobel network correcting loudspeaker impedance :See also Boucherot cell Zobel networks can be used to make the impedance a loudspeaker presents to its amplifier output appear as a steady resistance. This is beneficial to the amplifier performance. The impedance of a loudspeaker is partly resistive. The resistance represents the energy transferred from the amplifier to the sound output plus some heating losses in the loudspeaker. However, the speaker also possesses inductance due to the windings of its coil. The impedance of the loudspeaker is thus typically modelled as a series resistor and inductor. A parallel circuit of a series resistor and capacitor of the correct values will form a Zobel bridge. It is obligatory to choose \\\\scriptstyle R_B \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\infin because the centre point between the inductor and resistor is inaccessible (and, in fact, fictitious - the resistor and inductor are distributed quantities as in a transmission line). The loudspeaker may be modelled more accurately by a more complex equivalent circuit. The compensating Zobel network will also become more complex to the same degree.Leach, W. M., Jr., Impedance Compensation Networks for the Lossy Voice-Coil Inductance of Loudspeaker Drivers, Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, J. Audio Eng. Soc., Vol. 52, No. 4, April 2004. Available on-line here Note that the circuit will work just as well if the capacitor and resistor are interchanged. In this case the circuit is no longer a Zobel balanced bridge but clearly the impedance has not changed. The same circuit could have been arrived at by designing from Boucherot's minimising reactive power point of view. From this design approach there is no difference in the order of the capacitor and the resistor and Boucherot cell might be considered a more accurate description. Video equalisers Zobel networks can be used for the equalisation of video lines as well as audio lines. There is, however, a noticeably different approach taken with the two types of signal. The difference in the cable characteristics can be summarised a s follows; *Video commonly uses co-axial cable which requires an unbalanced topology for the filters whereas audio commonly uses twisted pair which requires a balanced topology. *Video requires a wider bandwidth and tighter differential phase specification which in turn results in a tighter dimensional specification for the cable. *The tighter specifications for video cable tends to produce a substantially constant characteristic impedance over a wide band (usually nominally 75 Ω). On the other hand, audio cable may be nominally 600 Ω (300 Ω and 150 Ω are also standard values), but it will only actually measure this value at 800 Hz. At a lower frequencies it will be much higher and at higher frequencies will be lower and more reactive. Response plot of a video line showing the typical \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sqrt{f} response *These characteristics result in a smoother, more well behaved response for video lines with none of the nasty discontinuities typically found with audio lines. These discontinuities in the frequency response are often caused by the habit of the telecom companies of forming a connection by joining two shorter lines of differing characteristic impedance. Video lines on the other hand tend to roll off smoothly with frequency in a predictable way. This more predictable response of video allows a different design approach. The video equaliser is built as a single bridged T section but with a rather more complex network for Z. For short lines, or for a trimming equaliser, a Bode filter topology might be used. For longer lines a network with Cauer filter topology might be used. Another driver for this approach is the fact that a video signal occupies a large number of octaves, around 20 or so. If equalised with simple basic sections, a large number of filter sections would be required. Simple sections are designed, typically, to equalise a range of one or two octaves. =Bode equaliser= Bode network for high frequency equalisation A Bode network, as with a Zobel network, is a symmetrical bridge T network which meets the constant k condition. It does not however meet the constant resistance condition, that is, the bridge is not in balance.Bode, Hendrik W., Wave Filter, US patent 2 002 216, , filed 7 June 1933, issued 21 May 1935. Any impedance network, Z, can be used in a Bode network, just as with a Zobel network, but the high pass section shown for correcting high-end frequencies is the most common. A Bode network terminated in a variable resistor can be used to produce a variable impedance at the input terminals of the network. A useful property of this network is that the input impedance can be made to vary from a capacitive impedance through a purely resistive impedance to an inductive impedance all by adjusting the single load potentiometer, RL. The bridging resistor, R0, is chosen to equal the nominal impedance so that in the special case when RL is set to R0 the network behaves as a Zobel network and Zin is also equal to R0. Bode network used in an equaliser circuit Bode trimming equaliser response plot The Bode network is used in an equaliser by connecting the whole network such that the input impedance of the Bode network, Zin, is in series with the load. Since the impedance of the Bode network can be either capacitive or inductive depending on the position of the adjustment potentiometer, the response may be a boost or a cut to the band of frequencies it is acting on. The transfer function of this arrangement is: :A(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{R_0}{Z_{in} + R_0} Bode equaliser implemented as a Zobel constant resistance equaliser The Bode equaliser can be converted into a constant resistance filter by using the entire Bode network as the Z branch of a Zobel network, resulting in a rather complex network of bridge T networks embedded in a larger bridge T. It can be seen that this results in the same transfer function by noting that the transfer function of the Bode equaliser is identical to the transfer function of the general form of Zobel equaliser. Note that the dual of a constant resistance bridge T network is the identical network. The dual of a Bode network is therefore the same network except for the load resistance RL, which must be the inverse, RL', in the dual circuit. To adjust the equaliser RL and RL' must be ganged, or otherwise kept in step such that as RL increases RL' will decrease and vice versa. =Cauer equaliser= Cauer topology network to be used as the Z impedance of a Zobel network equaliser To equalise long video lines, a network with Cauer topology is used as the Z impedance of a Zobel constant resistance network. Just as the input impedance of a Bode network is used as the Z impedance of a Zobel network to form a Zobel Bode equaliser, so the input impedance of a Cauer network is used to make a Zobel Cauer equaliser. The equaliser is required to correct an attenuation increasing with frequency and for this a Cauer ladder network consisting of series resistors and shunt capacitors is required. Optionally, there may be an inductor included in series with the first capacitor which increases the equalisation at the high end due to the steeper slope produced as resonance is approached. This may be required on longer lines. The shunt resistor R1 provides the basic loss of the Zobel network in the usual way. Cauer Zobel bridge T implemented video equaliser. The impedance Z of this example consists of a three section ladder and is suitable for the equalisation of short lines (between nearby buildings for instance) The dual of a RC Cauer network is a LR Cauer network which is required for the Z' impedance as shown in the example. Adjustment is a bit problematic with this equaliser. In order to maintain the constant resistance, the pairs of components C1/L1', C2/L2' etc., must remain dual impedances as the component is adjusted, so both parts of the pair must be adjusted together. With the Zobel Bode equaliser, this is a simple matter of ganging two pots together - a component configuration available off-the-shelf. Ganging together a variable capacitor and inductor is not, however, a very practical solution. These equalisers tend to be \\"hand built\\", one solution being to select the capacitors on test and fit fixed values according to the measurements and then adjust the inductors until the required match is achieved. The furthest element of the ladder from the driving point is equalising the lowest frequency of interest. This is adjusted first as it will also have an effect on higher frequencies and from there progressively higher frequencies are adjusted working along the ladder towards the driving point.

As of 2007, the company currently markets networking and VoIP products. The company was originally based in Framingham, Massachusetts and by 1990 was part of the Fortune 500. At one point Alloy was a major producer of QIC format tape drives and other computer peripherals. In the mid 1990s the company was no longer profitable. It filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. and the Australian subsidiary was bought out by the management team from the Australian division. Alloy Computer Products, Inc., was founded in 1979. Alloy was initially founded to supply hard drive and tape backup systems for S-100 bus computers running CP/M. When IBM's PC was released, Alloy provided hard drive storage and tape backup solutions for the new system. Alloy Computer Products later developed and marketed multi-user computer systems for the emerging microcomputer marketplace. Alloy later developed printing accelerator hardware. In 1984 Alloy developed the PC-Slave card which consisted of an X86 (8086 or V20) processor, either 256k or 1 Meg of memory and two serial ports. Later, an Intel 80286-based version was released, called the PC-Slave/286. These cards used RTNX (later renamed NTNX) to allow the host computer to provide disk storage and printing support. Dumb PC-Term terminals were attached to the PC-Slave to allow the running of DOS programs. At the time, using this solution was more cost-effective than using separate networked computers, but as computers and networking hardware became cheaper and cheaper, Alloy's advantage was overshadowed by the disadvantages of not being able to support graphics, etc. Alloy also developed a PC-Bus expansion bus system to allow the install of up to 32 PC-Slave cards attached to a single host PC. This allowed 32 user networks to be created, but each network was completely standalone. Based on the knowledge learned by developing the PC-Slave card, in 1985 Alloy developed the DOS-73 co-processor board for the AT&T; Unix-PC, allowing AT&T;'s Unix based Unix-PC (aka the PC-7300 and the 3B1) to run MS-DOS based programs. Alloy grew to $50 million in annual sales by 1986 and executed a successful IPO in June of that year. Alloy had an installed base of 150,000 users by the early 1990s, largely small businesses, comprising a relatively significant portion of the multi-user DOS marketplace. One DOS based computer was equipped with a multi-user/multi- tasking operating system called \\"386/MultiWare\\" which along with specialized hardware could provide serial connectivity to up to 20 dumb terminal clients. Each dumb terminal was connected to a session running up to 8 concurrent DOS virtual machines, all running on the host computer. If a problem arose with a single DOS virtual machine it could be rebooted without an effect on other terminals attached. Later \\"MultiNode\\" was introduced to meet client needs using the Novell network operating system allowing both Client/Server network connectivity as well as serial terminal users.

Onizuka was an extremely popular boxer in Japan, creating a boxing boom in Japan during the early 1990s along with Joichiro Tatsuyoshi. Biography Onizuka began boxing in middle school, entering a local boxing gym to begin training. He won several high amateur boxing tournaments in high school, but lost a match in his senior year against Hiroshi Kawashima, who would later win the WBC Super Flyweight title. Onizuka had already been accepted to Kinki University, but decided to turn pro after being battered in a sparring session with Hiroki Ioka, who had just become the WBC Minimumweight champion. He entered the Kyoei boxing gym in Tokyo, and made his professional debut in 1988 as a flyweight. Onizuka quickly built up his record, and won the Japanese Super Flweight title in October, 1990, which he defended three times before moving on to challenge the world title. His first world title match came in April, 1992, fighting Thanomsak Sithbaobay for the WBA Super Flyweight title, which had been vacated by legendary Thai boxer Khaosai Galaxy. Onizuka won a close 12 round decision, the first of the series of controversial wins in his career. Akinobu Hiranaka also won the WBA Super Lightweight title in Mexico the same day. He defended his title for the first time on September 11, 1990, winning by TKO in the 5th round. This would be his only non-decision win in world title fights. He fought Mexican fighter Armando Castro three months later for his second defense, and won an indisputable victory. This fight was the height of Onizuka's career. Onizuka's third defense came on May 21, 1993, against Korean fighter Jae-Shin Lim, who had previously fought with the alias, \\"Kotaro Hayashi.\\" Onizuka was predicted to win easily, but the challenger pummeled Onizuka throughout the fight, and Onizuka barely won by split decision. Two of the three judges of the fight were Japanese, and had both scored the bout in favor of Onizuka, making the fight one of the worst and most obvious cases of a hometown decision. After his controversial fight, Onizuka fought Thanomsak Sithbaobay for the second time, and made his fourth defense by another close 12 round decision. He made a fifth successful defense by 12 round decision on April 10, 1994, despite having been knocked down for the first time in his professional career in the 5th round. Onizuka finally lost in his sixth defense on September 18, 1994 against Hyung-Chul Lee, where he was trapped in the corner and beaten relentlessly for over a minute by the challenger. The referee finally stopped the fight in the 9th round, and Onizuka lost his title after two years of controversial defenses. He was found to have a detached retina in the right eye after the fight, and announced his retirement. Onizuka explained that he had actually suspected an injury in his right eye over two years ago, but had kept it to himself to avoid being forced into retirement. His record was 24-1-0 (17KOs). Post retirement Onizuka lived away from boxing for a while after retirement, but now trains young boxers at his boxing gym in his hometown, Fukuoka. He often appears on TBS boxing broadcasts as a commentator. Fans were reminded of Onizuka's controversial wins when Koki Kameda won a hometown decision to become the WBA Light Flyweight champion in 2006. Both Kameda and Onizuka were trained and managed by the Kyoei boxing gym, and Onizuka has appeared as a commentator in several of Kameda's fights.

He played hurling with the Kilkenny senior inter-county team in the 1970s and 1980s. Early life Ger Henderson was born in Johnstown, County Kilkenny in 1954. He was educated locally at Johnstown national school where his interest in hurling first began. Later, Henderson and his two brothers, Pat and John, would form the backbone of the Kilkenny team of the 1970s and early 1980s. Playing career =Club= Henderson played his club hurling with the local Fenians club in Johnstown. He was too young to play senior hurling when the club triumphed winning county championship titles in the early 1970s, however, he did win county title and a Leinster club title in 1974. =Inter-county= By 1972, Henderson was a member of the Kilkenny minor hurling team that won the All-Ireland title. He later joined the county’s under-21 side, winning back-to-back All-Ireland titles in 1974 and 1975. By this stage, Henderson was also a member of the Kilkenny senior hurling panel. In 1976, he tasted his first senior hurling success when he won a National Hurling League medal. Two years later, in 1978, Henderson had taken over from his brother Pat as centre- back on the team, and he won his first Leinster title that year. Kilkenny were later defeated by Cork in the All-Ireland final. In spite of this, Henderson’s championship performance earned him his first All-Star award. In 1979, Henderson captured a second Leinster title before later collecting his first All-Ireland following a win over Galway. Once again he was presented with an All-Star award, as well as claiming the Texaco Hurler of the Year award. Three years later, Henderson won a second National League and a third Leinster medal, before winning a second All-Ireland medal following a win over Cork. Once again, his performance at centre-back earned him his third All-Star award. In 1983, Henderson captured another quartet of National League, Leinster, All-Ireland and All-Star honours. The following few years saw Kilkenny’s hurling fortunes take a downturn. In spite of this, Henderson won a fourth National League in 1986, before adding a fifth Leinster title in 1987. Kilkenny were later defeated by Galway in the All-Ireland final.

Born in Johnstown, County Kilkenny, Henderson first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Thurles CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of eighteen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team, before later joining the under-21 team. He made his senior debut during the 1964 championship. Henderson went on to play a key role over the next fifteen years, and one five All-Ireland medals, eight Leinster medals and two National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on five occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Henderson won six Railway Cup medals. At club level he is a one-time Leinster medallist with Fenians. In addition to this he also won five championship medals. Throughout his inter-county career, Henderson made 40 championship appearances for Kilkenny. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1978 championship. His brothers, Ger and John, also enjoyed All-Ireland success with Kilkenny. In retirement from playing Henderson became involved in team management and coaching. During a near decade long tenure as Kilkenny manager he guided the team to three All-Ireland titles. Henderson is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers of his era. As well as collecting back-to-back All-Stars he was named Hurler of the Year in 1974. Henderson has often been voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at centre-back on the Kilkenny team of the Century. Biography Born in Johnstown, County Kilkenny, Henderson was the eldest son in a family that would later become synonymous with hurling in Kilkenny. His two younger brothers, Ger and John, would form the backbone of the great Kilkenny team of the 1970s. Henderson was educated at Johnstown national school before later receiving his secondary schooling at Thurles CBS. Here he played in the Dr. Harty Cup competition, however, Thurles CBS failed to win the provincial title during Henderson's tenure. Playing career =Club= Henderson began his club hurling career with Johnstown before the Fenians club was formed in 1968. After being defeated by James Stephens in the championship decider in 1969, both sides squared off against each other in the final the following year. A 2–11 to 3–5 victory gave Henderson his first championship medal. After surrendering their championship to Bennettsbridge in the decider in 1971, Fenians returned to the final once again the following year. It was a rematch of the previous year with Henderson's side enjoying a comfortable 3–10 to 1–6 victory. This was the beginning of a great run of success. Defeats of James Stephens and Bennettsbridge in the respective finals of 1973 and 1974 brought Henderson's medal tally to four. Fenians subsequently represented Kilkenny in the provincial club series and reached the final. A narrow 2–6 to 1–6 defeat of St. Rynagh's of Offaly resulted in the Fenians becoming the first Kilkenny club to take the Leinster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Henderson's side against the mighty St. Finbarr's of Cork. The Barr's ability to get goals at crucial times proved to be the difference in the 3–8 to 1–6 defeat. A fourth successive county title proved beyond Henderson's side in 1975, however, two years later Fenians were back in the championship decider. An Eddie Keher-inspired Rower-Inistioge provided the opposition, however, Henderson won his fifth and final championship medal that day following a 3–11 to 1–10 victory. =Inter-county= Henderson first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kilkenny minor hurling team in 1961. It was a successful year for the young hurler as he collected a Leinster medal following a 4–12 to 0–7 trouncing of Dublin. Henderson later collected an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal following a 3–13 to 0–15 defeat of Tipperary. In 1964 Henderson was at centre- back on Kilkenny's inaugural under-21 team, however, defeat was his lot in his sole outing in that championship. Henderson made his senior championship debut for Kilkenny on 5 July 1964 in a 5–9 to 4–8 Leinster semi-final defeat of Wexford. He later collected his first Leinster medal as Dublin were defeated by 4–11 to 1–8 in the decider. The All-Ireland final on 6 September 1964 saw Kilkenny enter the game as firm favourites against fierce rivals Tipperary. John McKenna scored Tipp's first goal after ten minutes as the Munster champions took a 1–8 to 0–6 interval lead. The second half saw Tipperary score goals for fun, with Donie Nealon getting a hat-trick and Seán McLoughlin another. Kilkenny were humiliated at the full-time whistle as Tipperary triumphed by 5–13 to 2–8. After surrendering their provincial crown in 1965, Kilkenny bounced back the following year by reaching the National League decider. An aggregate 10–15 to 2–15 defeat of New York gave Henderson his first National Hurling League medal. He later won a second Leinster medal following a 1–15 to 2–6 defeat of Wexford. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 4 September 1966 pitted Kilkenny against Cork for the first time in nineteen years. Kilkenny were the favourites, however, a hat-trick of goals by Colm Sheehan gave Cork a merited 3–9 to 1–10 victory. Kilkenny retained their provincial crown in 1967, with Henderson adding a third Leinster medal to his collection following a 4–10 to 1–12 defeat of Wexford after a scare in the opening half. 3 September 1967 saw Kilkenny face Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. Tipp looked like continuing their hoodoo over their near rivals as they took a 2–6 to 1–3 lead at half-time. Goalkeeper Ollie Walsh was the hero for Kilkenny as he made a series of spectacular saves, however, the team lost Eddie Keher and Tom Walsh to injury in the second half. In spite of this, Kilkenny laid to rest a bogey that Tipperary had over the team since 1922, and a 3–8 to 2–7 victory gave Henderson his first All-Ireland medal. Wexford put an end to Kilkenny's hopes of retaining the title in 1968, however, the Noresiders bounced back the following year with Henderson collecting a fourth Leinster medal following a 3–9 to 0–16 defeat of Offaly. 7 September 1969 saw Kilkenny face Cork in the All-Ireland decider. The Leesiders got into their stride following an early goal by Charlie McCarthy and led by six points coming up to half time when Kilkenny raised a green flag themselves. Kilkenny upped their performance after the interval and ran out winners on a 2–15 to 2–9 scoreline. The victory gave Henderson a second All-Ireland medal. After surrendering their provincial and All-Ireland crowns to Wexford the following year, Kilkenny began their complete dominance of the provincial championship in 1971. Henderson was appointed captain for the year, however, he missed the Leinster final victory through injury. He was back on the team for 5 September 1971 when Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final, the first to be broadcast in colour by Telefís Éireann and the only eighty-minute meeting between the two sides. Kilkenny's ever-dependable goalkeeper, Ollie Walsh, had a nightmare of a game in which he conceded five goals, one of which passed through his legs, while that year's Hurler of the Year, \\"Babs\\" Keating, played out the closing stages of the game in his bare feet. Eddie Keher set a new record by scoring 2–11, however, it wasn't enough as Tipperary emerged the victors on a score line of 5–17 to 5–14. In 1972 Henderson won a fifth Leinster medal following a thrilling draw and replay victory over Wexford. Once again, Cork provided the opposition in the All-Ireland final on 3 September 1972, a game which is often considered to be one of the classic games of the modern era. Halfway through the second-half Cork were on form and stretched their lead to eight points. Drastic action was required for Kilkenny and Eddie Keher was deployed closer to the Cork goal and finished the game with a tally of 2–9. Henderson collected his third All-Ireland medal following a remarkable 3–24 to 5–11 victory. Henderson added a sixth Leinster medal to his collection following a 4–22 to 3–15 defeat of Wexford. Kilkenny later faced Limerick in the All-Ireland final on 2 September 1973, however, their plans were hampered as a result of injuries and emigration. In spite of this, the game hung in the balance for the first-half, however, eight minutes after the restart Mossie Dowling got a vital goal for Limerick. Shortly after this Richie Bennis spearheaded a rampant Limerick attack which resulted in a 1–21 to 1–14 victory for Limerick. In spite of this defeat Henderson later collected his first All-Star. Wexford were, once again, narrowly defeated by Kilkenny in the 1974 provincial decider. The remarkable 6–13 to 2–24 victory gave Henderson a seventh Leinster medal. In a repeat of the previous year Limerick provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 1 September 1974. The Munster champions stormed to a five-point lead in the first eleven minutes, however, a converted penalty by Eddie Keher, supplemented by two further goals gave Kilkenny a 3–19 to 1–13 victory and gave Henderson a fourth All-Ireland medal. He later won a second All-Star award, as well as the Texaco Hurler of the Year award. Kilkenny made it five successive provincial titles in-a-row in 1975. The 2–20 to 2–14 defeat of Wexford gave Henderson his eighth Leinster medal. On 7 September 1975, Henderson lined out in another All-Ireland final, with surprise semi-final winners Galway providing the opposition. Playing with the wind in the first half, Galway found themselves ahead by 0–9 to 1–3 at the interval. Eddie Keher's huge tally of 2–7 kept Galway at bay giving Kilkenny a 2–22 to 2–10 victory. It was a fifth All-Ireland medal for Henderson. In 1976 Kilkenny looked a sure bet to capture a third successive All-Ireland crown. The season began well with Henderson winning a second National League medal following a 6–14 to 1–14 trouncing of Clare in a replay. Kilkenny's championship ambitions unravelled in spectacular fashion in the subsequent provincial campaign, when a 2–20 to 1–6 trouncing by Wexford dumped Henderson's team out of the championship. Henderson was now in the twilight of his career as Kilkenny's fortunes took an upward turn in 1978. He missed Kilkenny's provincial victory, however, he was included on the starting fifteen that faced Cork in the subsequent All-Ireland decider on 3 September 1978. Cork secured a first three-in-a-row of All-Ireland titles for the first time in over twenty years, as a Jimmy Barry-Murphy goal helped the team to a 1–15 to 2–8 victory over Kilkenny. This defeat brought the curtain down on Henderson's inter-county career. =Inter-provincial= Henderson also lined out with the great Leinster team in the inter-provincial hurling championship. He captured Railway Cup titles with his province in 1967, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1977. Managerial career =Kilkenny= In retirement from playing, Henderson turned his hand to inter-county management. Together with Eddie Keher he guided Kilkenny to an All-Ireland victory over Galway in 1979. Three years later in 1982 Henderson was the sole manager of his native-county. That year he coached 'the Cats' to a National Hurling League victory, as well as an All- Ireland final victory over Cork. In 1983 these feats were repeated with another brace of National league and All-Ireland victories.

In 2007, during the first season since its foundation, the team achieved promotion to the National First Division (now the National League).

He was the first bishop of Quimper. Corentin was a hermit at Plomodiern and was regarded as one of the seven founding saints of Brittany. He is the patron saint of Cornouaille, Brittany, and is also the patron saint of seafood. His feast day is December 12. History and tradition Saint Corentin is one of the \\"Seven Saints\\" who evangelized Brittany. The others are: Saint Tugdual de Tréguier, Saint Paterne de Vannes, Saint Samson of Dol, Saint Pol de Léon, Saint Malo and Saint Brieuc. The Tro Breiz, which in Breton means \\"tour of Brittany\\", is a Catholic pilgrimage that connects the cities of the seven legendary saints of Brittany, monks from Wales and Cornwall who brought Christianity to Armorica and founded the first bishoprics in the fifth century and sixth century. Corentin's life is told in the book Vita de saint Corentin, written by Dom Plaine around 1220–1235. This publication was revised and comments were added to it, particularly after the discovery of a book called The Ancient Life of Saint Corentin.E. C. Fawtier-Jones, \\"La vita ancienne de saint Corentin\\", in Mémoires de la Société d'histoire et d'archéologie de Bretagne, volume 6 (1925), p. 8.André-Yves Bourgès, \\"À propos de la Vita de saint Corentin\\", 2008 The song of Aiquin also evokes his life.André-Yves Bourgès, \\"La chanson d'Aiquin et saint Corentin, Hagiohistoriographie médiévale\\" , 2009 According to ', Saint Corentin was born in a region called . He became a hermit in the city of Plomodiern, adjacent to Ménez-Hom, where he was already changing lives through his devotion to people. His selflessness was renowned across France, and through the medium of scriptures and word of mouth, his humanitarianism was recognised in Europe also. Legend has it that near where he was living, a miraculous fish would present itself to Saint Corentin in a fountain. He would cut a small piece of the fish to feed himself, and that piece would regrowLes Sept Saints Fondateurs de la Bretagne : Saint Corentin (he would otherwise feed himself with herbs and roots found in the forest). When King Gradlon decided to create the diocese of Quimper, he called on Corentin and asked him to become the first bishop. He sent Corentin to the city of Tours so that he could be consecrated by Saint Martin. He was accompanied by his disciples, Saint Guénolé, founder of Landévennec Abbey, and Saint Tudy were contemporaries and disciples of Corentin. Gradlon also gave him a palace on the location where the Quimper Cathedral now stands. After his death, he was buried in front of the altar of the Quimper Cathedral. An abbey was dedicated to him in 1201 by King Philippe Auguste, near Mantes; it was called Saint Corentin Abbey. He is also known in Cornwall, where St. Corentine's Church, Cury is dedicated to him.Doble, G. H. (1962) The Saints of Cornwall: part 2. Truro: Dean and Chapter; pp. 45-53 Legend of Ys Gradlon et Corentin In the Breton legend of the city of Ys, Corentin is the saint who observed the fall of Ys and warned King Gradlon of the sin committed by his daughter, Dahut (Ahes). The Christianization of the Celts was concurrent with the fall of Rome, and so the mercy of Corentin towards Gradlon symbolized the cultural transition. Prior to Christianity, the Celtic lifestyle was based around estuarine aquaculture dependent upon the pattern of the tides. In lowland environments where flooding is a major hazard, megaliths served as an astronomical calendar to predict the movement of water. Coastal Celts (also called Armoricans) used a system of dikes and locks to provide irrigation on an alternating basis, allowing separate plots of land to switch between producing cereals and shellfish. Corentin is a patron saint of seafood and, through him, inland aquaculture demonstrates the sustainability of Celtic Christianity over prior practices. Later tales blamed the caprice of Princess Dahut for the cataclysm at Ys. Some tales refer to her as a descendant of faeries sent to beguile King Gradlon into ruin. Others depict her as a princess seduced by the devil into opening the floodgates. The tales share a common plot point: King Gradlon and Princess Dahut magically escaping to shore on horseback where they are waylaid by Saint Corentin, (or in some versions Saint Guénolé) who decries the excess of Dahut, causing her to fall into the water and become a morgen or siren.Francoise Le Roux and Christian-J. Guyonvarc'h , The legend of the city of Is , Ouest-France editions, May 2000, p. 78-86 Saint Corentin then absconds to his hermitage while the king embarks on a hunting party. Gradlon becomes lost and hungry enough to request food when he stumbles upon Corentin's hermitage. Corentin offers the king a morsel of his miraculous, regenerative fish, symbolizing the gift of Christianity. Iconography He is represented with a whole fish or a half of fish (reminder of the fish he shared with the hunter) that he holds in his hand or at his feet where he is sometimes associated with a fountain.

It passes under Rožca Saddle between Rosenbach in southern Austria and Jesenice in northern Slovenia. Upon opening in October 1906, the Karawanks Tunnel formed an important element of the Karawanken Railway, which was - together with the Bohinj Railway - constructed to connect the port of Trieste with Klagenfurt, the capital of the federal state of Carinthia in Austria. Despite the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which had been a driving force for its construction, the line and tunnel alike continued to be a well-trafficked route largely used by freight trains travelling between Austrian and Slovenia. During the twenty-first century, the Karawanks Tunnel underwent extensive modernisation, being rationalised from a twin-track layout to a single track to comply with modern safety standards. History Between 1867 and 1918, Trieste was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was of considerable strategic importance, being that it was Austria's first seaport and thus naturally became the principal outlet for overseas trading by the Austro-Hungarian Empire; however, its effectiveness was undermined by the lack of an adequate railway communication with the Austrian interior. Seeking to greatly bolster international trade activity at Trieste in particular and the over-sea trade of Austria in general, it was decided in 1901 to construct a railway to connect Trieste and Klagenfurt. This line, the Karawanken Railway, was built over and through the Karawanks, Europe's longest (120 km/70 mi) mountain range; the route presently crosses the border between Austria and Slovenia. A key feature of the railway was the Karawanks Tunnel. Its construction was particularly challenging due to the local geology being particularly unstable. Boring was accomplished by teams working at either end of the alignment, as many as 6,000 men worked in the tunnel's vicinity at the peak of activity. Electricity generated by waterfalls near to the future tunnel portals were used to power various items of equipment, from lighting to ventilation fans. Progress was made at an average rate of 13 feet per day, although complications would occasionally cause less progress to be made. In comparison to contemporary tunnels, the total cost of its construction was notably higher. Such was the importance of the Karawanks Tunnel that, on 1 October 1906, the opening ceremony was officiated by the Austro-Hungarian head of state, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The tunnel quickly became a heavily trafficked freight route, even after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire during the following decade. Through to the present day, it has remained of importance to international freight traffic, being reportedly traversed by in excess of 80 trains per day.Video (Tunnel: 3:20 - 3:45)  Twenty-first century renovations  In 2015, Austria and Slovenia, along with their respective railway infrastructure operating companies, signed an agreement for the renovation and improvement of the Karawanks Tunnel. The project has a total budget of 115 million euros, divided over the kilometers of each country, Slovenia contributing 50 million euros while Austria is to spend 65.3 million euros; the project is also financially supported by the European Union within the framework of the Connecting Europe Facility Program. The construction work is scheduled to begin on August 10, 2020 and will be carried out by the Austrian STRABAG for both countries.https://www.rtvslo.si/gospodarstvo/zelezniski-predor-karavanke-bo- nadgrajeval-strabag/531332https://www.24ur.com/novice/gospodarstvo/zelezniski- predor-karavanke-bo-obavljal-avstrijski-strabag.html?fbclid=IwAR0gjz- Qq7jpuyQzWIg0VikvgQyMk58LhN-9hMJuANBkmPLcNDGL8yjyO_0 From October 5, 2020 to April 4, 2021, the tunnel is to be closed completely and completed by the end of the year.https://www.dnevnik.si/1042934482 Perhaps most noticeable amongst the changes to be made shall be the reduction of the original twin-track arrangement to a single track configuration; the resulting space freed up is to be reused as an emergency rescue passage, improving safety throughout the tunnel. In parallel with this work, various other improvements and modernisations shall be made to the 100 year old structure, intended to bring it up to modern standards. These changes include the installation of a ceiling busbar, drainage renewal, a new floor, as well as the partial renovation of the tunnel vault via the addition of new anchors, reinforcement measures and concrete. The portals from the imperial era are also to be renovated and shine in new splendor. The implementation of new safety standards shall enable a higher operating speed inside the tunnel and make the tunnel RoLa - suitable. Despite the fact that the tunnel will only be operated with only the one track in the future, this is unlikely to particularly inhibit traffic as the rest of the line is a single-track as well; to reinstate the second track in compliance with modern safety regulation shall necessitate the boring of a second tunnel, which would involve considerable investment. In the long term, it is being considered to build a second tube, just like the road tunnel, so that there should be one tunnel with one track per direction of travel. Therefore, as of summer 2020, a study is currently in preparation, which should already determine the best position for a possible second tube. Geology in particular should play a major role here, since it is very unfavorable in the Slovenian area of the current tunnel and has caused many problems in the construction of the first tube. In a historical building documentation, for example, it was described how a drilling rig was regularly crushed by the yielding rock mass and had to be freed again and again. Mine gases and mountain water also caused massive problems. The same was true for the construction of the first road tunnel, which lies in the same geology and runs practically parallel to the railway tunnel. The current solution with only one tunnel and one track should last until 2040, after which the construction of a second tube could be pending.https://www.dnevnik.si/1042934482  References  External links * Safety Management for Austrian Railway Tunnels Category:Railway tunnels in Austria Category:Railway tunnels in Slovenia Category:International tunnels Category:Austria–Slovenia border crossings Category:Tunnels completed in 1906 Category:Municipality of Jesenice Category:Tunnels in the Alps Category:Base tunnels Category:Single-tube railway tunnels with a proposed second tube Category:1906 establishments in Austria-Hungary ","title":"Karawanks Tunnel (railway)"},{"id":"10761147","text":"In mathematics, the Reeb vector field, named after the French mathematician Georges Reeb, is a notion that appears in various domains of contact geometry including: * in a contact manifold, given a contact 1-form \\\\alpha, the Reeb vector field satisfies R \\\\in \\\\mathrm{ker }\\\\ d\\\\alpha, \\\\ \\\\alpha (R) = 1 http://people.math.gatech.edu/%7Eetnyre/preprints/papers/phys.pdf http://www2.im.uj.edu.pl/katedry/K.G/AutumnSchool/Monday.pdf , * in particular, in the context of Sasakian manifold#The Reeb vector field.

Born on August 8, 1979 in Montreal and brought up in the West side of the city, Tomalty's mother tongue is English but he speaks and performs in both English and French. Still very active in the industry using his full name, Jonas Tomalty is now in his third decade of live performance, touring and recording. His new solo album \\"Undivided\\" is set to be released in early 2021. Career =Off the top= At 8 years old Jonas joined school board choir the PSBGM chorale (now known as EMSB chorale) , allowing him to travel around and hone his musical theory, vocal skills and harmonies. In early high school he started a rock band called Rubberman with whom he won the first prize in 1999 at CHOM-FM's annual contest \\"CHOM L'Esprit\\" as well as 's \\"\\" contest. They quickly signed to Donald K Donald's label Aquarius Records (Canada) and released the self titled \\"Rubberman\\". The band had medial success across Canada and that brotherhood formed the base of Tomalty's love for the craft. That same year he formed a blues side project with his harmonica playing father called Jonas & The Blues Blooded. An outfit that had its own success for many years across the province of Quebec. =The \\"Jonas\\" Years= His first major success \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" (originally performed by Stevie Nicks) appeared on his gold selling EP \\"Jonas\\" in 2004. It was soon followed by \\"Show Me\\", \\"Daddy\\" and \\"Like A River\\" that all reached the top of the Québec radio charts. That year he and his band toured North America opening for Van Halen. The success of Jonas earned two nominations at the Juno Awards of 2006 in the \\"New Artist of the Year\\" and \\"Rock Album of the Year\\" categories. http://www.showbizz.net/quebec/jonas_etonne_heureux_ses_nominations_aux_juno_awards-15609.html Soon after, his DVD Jonas Live ...As We Roll!, a live recording of a show at Montreal's music hall Métropolis on June 2, 2005, was released and went platinum in a week. His second album Suite Life was put out in October 2006 and featured \\"SuperSexMe\\", which was the first single from it. \\"Bows and Arrows\\" was the second. This was the first year that Jonas and his band were invited to play in Afghanistan for the armed forces. An incredible, eye opening experience for Tomalty and relationship with the soldiers and veterans that continues to this day. In 2007, Tomalty released his third album Promised Land. This album contained the best from his first two albums and was marketed for international release. The album was released but never got out of Canada due to a battle with their record label that, shortly after, ended their four- year relationship. The release was however followed by a cross-Canadian tour with Collective Soul, and the band followed it with another live DVD of their Montreal Bell Centre performance called Live at the Bell Centre. The band continued touring Quebec and Canada for the next few years while managing a messy transition between label and management. This would set the scene for the next chapter in Jonas's career. =With Jonas & The Massive Attraction= In 2010, Tomalty signed to new management, changed his rhythm section and renamed the band Jonas & The Massive Attraction with long time friend and guitar player/phenom, Corey Diabo (originally of Jonas & The Blues Blooded & Jonas ) . They went on to release their album \\"Big Slice\\". The title track \\"Big Slice\\" hit the top 10 of the Canadian Radio charts and opened the door to a busy few years of touring in Europe and their home country of Canada. Opening for acts like Kid Rock and The Cult, sharing the stage with Patty Smith, Alanis Morissette, Gavin DeGraw and touring with Deep Purple were all part of the whirlwind years that followed. The 2013 album release \\"Live Out Loud\\" ( co-written and produced by the legendary Marti Frederiksen) brought the boys back onto the Quebec franco charts with \\"Respire\\" (the french version of \\"Breathing\\" that hit #2) and the second franco adaptation \\"Je Crie Ton Nom\\" (co-written by Simon Wilcox, Nelson Minville and Mark Holman) that became Jonas' first SOCAN #1 single and opened the door to more contemporary collaborations for Tomalty. It is then that he teamed up with monster producer Fred St-Gelais for the first time and recorded his first duo with Quebec pop icon Marie-Mai. Their collaboration \\"Jamais Trop Tard\\" would also reach #1 in the charts and set up the creative trio for another success; the Christmas song \\" Christmas Calling\\" written by Tomalty. It is on this recording that you can hear the voices of the new generation of Jonas's first choir, the PSBGM chorale. In 2014, to underline Jonas and Corey's 10 years of recording together, they releases \\"Album X\\" as Jonas & The Massive Attraction. A recording that boasted 7 brand new songs like \\"Lifeline\\" (co-written by Raine Maida of Our lady peace) and 3 re-recordings of past successes such as Bow & Arrows, Daddy and Burn The House Down. The band toured this album for the next few years and cut a live version on the show for the release of Live & Electric in 2017. = A new page = In the following years Jonas took time from heaving touring and recording whilst still playing intimate acoustic performances with Diabo. He took time to open a restaurant/music venue in Old Montreal with some friends called Rosewood. A passion he had long wanted to connect with. He bought a home on the outskirts of the city with his back-up vocalist, Carmen D'Astous (with whom he had a baby boy, Lennon Alexander Tomalty, born Feb 13 2020) It was summer 2017 then when Tomalty started to write songs outside of his normal genre and began to explore a new solo venture. The material from that period would be the building blocks of his new solo career. He brought his last name into the mix and began his new artistic journey as Jonas Tomalty. In 2018 he signed to new management, Francis Delage / Unitalent (Marc Dupré, Corneille, Les Deux Frères, Garoux) and they signed with Artic Records / The Orchard/ Sony for the release of his first real solo album, Jonas Tomalty : Undivided (to be released in early 2021). The first single \\"Closer\\" was released late summer on 2020 and broke the top 40 in the corresponding charts on its second week out. His long-time friend and Grammy- winning producer Hex Hector (J-Lo's Waiting for Tonight Remix) took \\"Closer\\" and reimagined it with a completely different, funky flavour and delivered the very funk \\"Closer; the Hex Hector Mix\\". To be release in September of 2020.

The games archive focuses primarily on console games and PC from 1993 to 2014 and includes a few titles dating back to the early '80s. Material from the collection is available to the MSU community through the MSU Libraries catalog and to Michigan residents through MeLCat, the Michigan e-library catalog. =Turfgrass Information Center= The Turfgrass Information Center (TIC), a specialized unit at the Michigan State University Libraries (MSU), contains the most comprehensive publicly available collection of turfgrass educational materials in the world. TIC has over 250,000 records in its primary database, the Turfgrass Information File (TGIF).Turfgrass Information Center of Michigan State University Accessed: 3/11/2011 In the 1960s, the Michigan State University (MSU) Library began to collect printed turfgrass materials. In 1968, the personal collection of the late O.J. Noer, pioneer turf agronomist, was added to the library holdings through the O.J. Noer Foundation. Later gifts have included the Noer/Milorganite® Image Collection (on indefinite loan), the Scotts Company Archive, and most significantly, the James B Beard Turfgrass Library Collection. Today, the combined collection is recognized as the most extensive public collection of turfgrass material in existence. Between 1983 and 1992, the United States Golf Association (USGA) Turfgrass Research Program supported the development of the USGA Turfgrass Information File (TGIF). Using the Noer Collection as a foundation, TGIF was designed to systematically inventory published turf research and make the bibliographic information available via a computerized database. The TGIF database is accessible online through the Web. With over 250,000 searchable items using over 300,000 keywords, these resources cover the full scope of the turfgrass industry. This database monitors over 1,000 journals and magazines, research reports, and conference proceedings. In addition, the database includes records for extension bulletins, books and book chapters, technical reports, theses and dissertations, web documents, published Q & As, scanned golf course plans, and video interviews. =Vincent Voice Library Collection= The G.

Born in Johnstown, County Kilkenny, Henderson first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Coláiste Mhuire. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 1979 championship. Henderson immediately became a regular member of the team and won three All-Ireland medals, six Leinster medals and four National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions Henderson won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he is a one-time championship medallist with Fenians while he also won a championship medal with Glenealy. His brothers, Pat and Ger, won a combined total of eight All- Ireland medals with Kilkenny. Throughout his career Henderson made 34 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1991 championship. In retirement from playing Henderson became involved in team management and coaching. At inter-county level he managed the Wicklow senior team and the Dublin under-21 team while at club level he took charge of Cuala, Bray Emmets and Glenealy. Henderson also served as an analyst on the Sunday Game. Early life Henderson was born in Johnstown, County Kilkenny in 1957, where he was educated locally at Johnstown's National School, where his interest in hurling reportedly first began. Later, Henderson and his two brothers, Pat and Ger, would form the backbone of the great Kilkenny team of the 1970s and early 1980s. He went to college in Carlow RTC where he won an All Ireland college's football medal. Playing career =Club= Henderson was a key member of the Feniains senior team that reached the 1977 championship decider. An Eddie Keher-inspired Rower-Inistioge provided the opposition, however, Henderson won a Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship medal following a 3–11 to 1–10 victory. Almost twenty years later and Henderson was lining out with Glenealy in County Wicklow. In 1996 was at full- forward as the club faced Carnew Emmets in the championship decider. A 3-7 to 0-9 victory secured the victory and a championship medal for Henderson. =Minor and under-21= Henderson first played for Kilkenny as a member of the minor team in 1974. He was an unused substitute during that year's campaign and collected a Leinster medal on the bench following an 8-19 to 3-5 trouncing of Dublin. The following year Henderson was included as a regular member of the starting fifteen. A 2-18 to 3-4 defeat of Dublin secured a fifth successive provincial title for the team and a first Leinster medal on the field of play for Henderson. On 6 September 1975 Kilkenny faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider. The Cats proved much too strong and powered to a 3-19 to 1-14 victory, giving Henderson an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. Two years later in 1977 Henderson was a key member of the Kilkenny under-21 team. He won a Leinster that year as Wexford were downed on a score line of 3-11 to 1-10. Cork were once again waiting for Kilkenny in the All- Ireland decider. Having been beaten the previous year, Kilkenny secured a narrow 2-9 to 1-9 victory giving Henderson an All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal. =Senior= Henderson made his senior championship debut on 24 June 1979 in a 4-15 to 4-11 Leinster semi-final defeat of Dublin. He later won a Leinster medal as Wexford were defeated by 2-21 to 2-17. On 2 September 1979 Kilkenny faced Galway in the All-Ireland final. Bad weather and an unofficial train drivers’ strike resulted in the lowest attendance at a final in over twenty years. The bad weather also affected the hurling with Kilkenny scoring two freak goals as Galway ‘keeper Séamus Shinnors had a nightmare of a game. A Liam “Chunky” O’Brien 70-yard free went all the way to the net in the first half, while with just three minutes remaining a 45-yard shot from Mick Brennan was helped by the wind and dipped under the crossbar. Kilkenny won by 2-12 to 1-8 with Henderson winning his first All-Ireland medal. After a fallow two-year period, Kilkenny bounced back in 1982 with Henderson winning his first National Hurling League medal following a 2-14 to 1-11 defeat of Wexford. He later added a second Leinster medal to his collection following a 1-11 to 0-12 defeat of three-in-a-row hopefuls and reigning All-Ireland champions Offaly. On 5 September 1982 Kilkenny and Cork renewed their rivalry in the All-Ireland decider. The Cats were rank outsiders on the day, however, a brilliant save by Noel Skehan was followed by two quick goals by Christy Heffernan just before the interval. Éamonn O'Donoghue pegged a goal back for Cork, however, Ger Fennelly added a third for Kilkenny who secured a 3-18 to 1-13 victory. It was a second All-Ireland medal for Henderson. Henderson won a second consecutive league medal in 1983 following a narrow 2-14 to 2-12 defeat of Limerick before later collecting a third Leinster medal as Offaly were accounted for by 1-17 to 0-13. The All-Ireland final on 4 September 1983 was a replay of the previous year with Cork hoping to avenge that defeat. Billy Fitzpatrick was the star with ten points, giving Kilkenny a 2-14 to 1-9 lead with seventeen minutes left, however, they failed to score for the remainder of the game. A stunning comeback by Cork just fell short and Henderson collected a third All-Ireland medal following a 2-14 to 2-12 victory. He later won an All-Star. In 1986 Kilkenny bounced back with Henderson collecting a third league medal following a 2-10 to 2-6 defeat of Galway. He later collected a fourth Leinster medal following a 4-10 to 1-11 defeat of reigning champions Offaly. Henderson won a fifth Leinster medal in 1987 as Offaly were downed once again by 2-14 to 0-17. On 6 September 1987 Galway, a team who were hoping to avoid becoming the first team to lose three finals in-a-row, faced a Kilkenny team who for many of its players knew it would be their last chance to claim an All-Ireland medal. Galway ‘keeper John Commins saved two goal chances from Ger Fennelly, while at the other end substitute Noel Lane bagged a decisive goal as Galway claimed a 1-12 to 0-9 victory. Offaly dominated the provincial series over the next three years, however, Kilkenny emerged once again in 1990. An 0-18 to 0-9 defeat of New York gave Henderson a fourth league medal. Henderson won a sixth Leinster medal in 1991 but not without difficulty. With seconds left in the game the Dubs were winning by a single point, however, a last-gasp goal sealed a 1-11 to 0-13 victory. On 1 September 1991 Kilkenny faced old rivals Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. The opening thirty-five minutes saw both sides trade score-for-score, however, a controversial 20-metre free, miss-hit by Michael Cleary, landed in the net and gave Tipperary a lead which they never surrendered. The final score of 1–16 to 0–15 resulted in defeat for Henderson. After retiring from Kilkenny, Henderson joined the Wicklow senior team. Managerial career In retirement from playing, Henderson turned his hand to inter-county management. He spent a short period in charge of the Wicklow senior hurling team, however, he had little success. He has managed several Bray Emmets juvenile teams to success. He managed the Cuala senior hurling team in Dublin prior to his management role with Dublins under 21 team. He managed the Bray Emmets Senior team to their first Wicklow Senior Hurling Championship in 61 years in 2014, along with a Division 2 Leinster League. He backed that up by managing Bray Emmets to another County Hurling title in 2015.

The term \\"Similkameen District\\" also refers to the Similkameen Mining District, a defunct government administrative district, which geographically encompasses the same area, and in more casual terms may also refer to the Similkameen electoral district, which was combined with the Grand Forks- Greenwood riding by the time of the 1966 election. The Similkameen Country has deep historical connections to the Boundary Country and the two are sometimes considered one region, partly as a result of the name of the electoral district. It is also sometimes classed as being part of the Okanagan region, which results from shared regional district and other administrative boundaries and names. The term \\"Similkameen District\\" may also historically refer to the Similkameen Division Yale Land District, which also includes Osoyoos and the Boundary Country to Osoyoos' east. Although the Similkameen River's last few miles are in Washington state, only the British Columbia part of the river's basin is named \\"the Similkameen\\". The Similkameen is one of several historical regions of British Columbia whose foundations and settlement lay in the days of the Colony of British Columbia, and was one of the first areas of the province prospected as well as farmed and ranched. The area has seen a number of famous gold strikes and large mining operations, notably the Tulameen Gold Rush of the 1880s and 1890s and the Nickel Plate Mine at Hedley, but also including coal at Blakeburn and Coalmont, and copper at Allenby and Copper Mountain, all of these locations in the vicinity of Princeton. Orcharding and ranching are important to the Similkameen Country, with orcharding and ranching operations in the Keremeos first started by Bohemian immigrant Francis Xavier Richter in 1864. Richter's original of fruit trees at Keremeos Centre are considered to be one of the two foundations of BC's orcharding industry, the other being started by the Oblate Fathers at Okanagan Mission.

Originally a civil servant, his imprisonment as a conscientious objector during the First World War forced him to change careers. He was elected to Parliament in 1935 and developed a reputation for interest in colonial matters, gaining the nickname \\"unofficial member of the Kikuyu at Westminster\\". He served in the Colonial Office in the Labour government of 1945–1950. After losing his seat in the 1950 general election he was involved in writing and lecturing about British colonies, before returning to Parliament in 1954. Initially he was known as Arthur Jones, but throughout his time in politics he invariably used his middle name. Early life Jones was the son of a lithographic printer from Bristol. He went to Whitehall Boys' School, and won a scholarship to study French, Mathematics and Commerce for an extra year when he was 13. On leaving school in 1905, he worked in a solicitor's office and prepared for the Civil Service Junior Clerks' Examination. Having passed the exam, he joined the War Office and later worked for the Crown Agents, who acted as the London representatives of British dominions and colonies. He also attended evening classes to improve his education. In his spare time, Jones was also involved with political groups; he was an active member of the Liberal Christian League, which brought him into contact with senior members of the Liberal Party. His education about politics led him to question, and eventually drop, his membership of the Methodist church. He helped to found the Camberwell Trades and Labour Council in 1913, and later became honorary Secretary of the Dulwich branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP). After the outbreak of the First World War, Jones was involved across London with the ILP; he had become a pacifist, and organised anti-conscription meetings when conscription was introduced in 1916. Imprisonment He was called up that autumn, but refused to participate in any way. As a result, Jones was not granted an exemption from military service and was sent to prison from September 1916, and was not released until April 1919. He used his imprisonment as an opportunity to read further on history, politics and economics; he also made useful contacts in prison with figures who would later become senior in the Labour Party. Trade unionist On leaving prison, Creech Jones was unable to resume a civil service career; instead he did research on prisons for the Labour Research Department, a trade union-funded body (it did not have any formal connections with the Labour Party). Later that year he was appointed as Secretary of the National Union of Docks, Wharves and Shipping Staffs, and edited the union journal. When his union became a founding constituent of the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU) in 1922, he was promoted to be national secretary of the administrative, clerical and supervisory section. At the 1922 London County Council election he was one of the Labour candidates for Peckham; additionally, he sat on the London Labour Party executive from 1921 to 1928. As part of his work for the TGWU, he visited the Ruhr Area to observe the effects of French occupation in 1923—writing a pamphlet about the issue on his return—and helped to train Clements Kadalie of the South African Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union in how to organise a union. Creech Jones wrote a pamphlet, Trade Unionism To-day, which was published by the Workers' Educational Association in 1928. He was heavily involved in the Workers' Educational Association, and also served as a Governor of Ruskin College, Oxford which was funded by the trade unions. Travelling At the 1929 general election, he fought the constituency of Heywood and Radcliffe as Labour Party candidate. He left his position at the TGWU after he was elected organising secretary of the Workers' Travel Association (WTA), which funded foreign trips for people employed in industry.\\"Workers' Travel Association\\", The Times, 29 December 1930. He spent a large part of the next decade travelling, writing up his trips in Travel Log, the journal of the WTA. Having visited most European countries, including Nazi Germany, he directed a rescue of hundreds of Jews from Czechoslovakia through the WTA after the Munich Agreement was signed. After the formation of the National Government, Creech Jones at first went along with his TGWU colleague Ernest Bevin in joining the Socialist League. He was a leading figure in the National I.L.P. Affiliation Committee, which sought to persuade the Independent Labour Party to continue its affiliation to the Labour Party,\\"The Split in the I.L.P.\\", The Times, 29 August 1932. but when the fight was lost, he resigned from the ILP and joined the Labour Party directly. Initially unwilling to try for a seat in Parliament, it was reported to be his observation of events in Germany which persuaded him to change his mind and at the 1935 general election he won the constituency of Shipley as a Labour Party candidate; his election was helped by the Conservative vote being split between the official candidate and the sitting Member of Parliament (MP), who had been deselected. Member of Parliament Creech Jones specialised in Colonial affairs in Parliament, especially those in Africa. In June 1936 he pressed the Government, which were encouraging colonies to set up memorials to King George V, to follow the example of Uganda and set up a technical educational institution.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 18 June 1936. The Labour Party nominated him to the Colonial Office's Educational Advisory Committee in 1936, on which he served for nine years. In 1937, he was a founding member of the Trades Union Congress Colonial Affairs Committee, and in 1940 he founded the Fabian Colonial Bureau. In 1939 Creech Jones promoted his Private Member's Bill, the Access to Mountains Bill, to Parliament. He had long enjoyed walking in the open countryside, but found private landowners had barred the way; the Bill required mountains and moorland to be opened. Creech Jones organised a conference with those who would be affected by the Bill, at which agreement was reached on amendments to it that would enable their objections to be withdrawn;\\"Public Access To Mountains\\", The Times, 27 February 1939. this compromise enabled the Bill to pass into law. When Ernest Bevin was appointed Minister of Labour in 1940, he chose Creech Jones as his Parliamentary Private Secretary. He used his influence in the Government to improve conditions for conscientious objectors. As Chairman of the Labour Party's advisory committee on imperial issues, Creech Jones did much to formulate party policy on the colonies prior to the 1945 general election. He was Vice-Chairman of the Commission on Higher Education for West Africa which was set up in 1943,\\"Future of the Colonies\\", The Times, 14 July 1943. visiting the West African colonies to compile a well- received report.See, e.g., \\"Planning Colonial Progress\\" (Leader), The Times, 10 June 1944. Attlee government After the Labour Party won the 1945 election, Creech Jones was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Colonial Office, with The Times wondering why he was not given a more senior post.\\"Completing the Team\\" (leader), The Times, 6 August 1945. He was a delegate to the first sitting of the United Nations General Assembly in London in 1946. Creech Jones' support for eventual self-government of the colonies by all their inhabitants was unpopular with those colonies which were run by British settlers, and he had to moderate his speeches when he visited colonies such as Kenya.\\"Assurance To Kenya Settlers\\", The Times, 26 July 1946. He also dealt with the British mandate in Palestine in its final years. Colonial Secretary In October 1946, the Secretary of State for the Colonies George Hall was moved in a government reshuffle and Creech Jones was promoted to head the Department, with a seat in the Cabinet and membership of the Privy Council. Creech Jones took over at a time when the tensions in Palestine were increasing, and he frequently appealed to moderate Jewish leaders to restrain the more violent.\\"Statement in House of Commons\\", The Times, 29 January 1947. He was again a delegate to the United Nations during its debate on the subject, and informed the UN of the British government's determination to give up the mandate and withdraw British forces.\\"British Statement To U.N. On Palestine\\", The Times, 27 September 1947. In September 1947, Creech Jones chaired the British West Indies conference at Montego Bay discussing closer association and possible federation of the British colonies in the area.\\"B.W.I. Conference\\", The Times, 12 September 1947. The conference produced a preliminary agreement on federation and dominion status. He was later forced to recall Oliver Baldwin as Governor of the Leeward Islands, who had made outspoken comments which local opinion had taken badly.\\"Earl Baldwin of Bewdley\\", The Times, 12 August 1958. In Africa, Creech Jones presided over a conference at Lancaster House for the African colonies in 1948. He was able to issue a memorandum on local government in the Colonies, which confirmed the intention to bring in responsible government. He was able to make progress in the colony of Ceylon where he introduced a Government Bill to give the colony Dominion status and eventual independence.\\"Independence Bill For Ceylon\\", The Times, 15 November 1947. He thus presided over the Colonial Office's first granting of independence to a 'non-white' colony. (Independence for India and Pakistan a year earlier had been the responsibility of the India Office.) Internally he reorganised the Colonial Office and its associated civil service to make it more appropriate for the changed role he foresaw for it. Defeat At the 1950 general election, Creech Jones' constituency of Shipley was subjected to boundary changes, and he was vigorously challenged by the Conservatives. He ended up losing his seat by a narrow 81 votes to Geoffrey Hirst, being one of the most prominent Ministerial casualties of the election. Out of Parliament he spent more time with the Fabian Colonial Bureau for whom he chaired conferences and lectured. He edited volumes of the Fabian Colonial Essays. He also tried to get back into Parliament. When Sir Stafford Cripps resigned his seat at Bristol South East in the autumn of 1950, Creech Jones was the favourite to succeed him, given his status and his family connections to the city.Michael Cocks, \\"Labour and the Benn Factor\\" (Macdonald, 1989), p. 12. However, he lost the selection to Anthony Wedgwood Benn. At the 1951 general election Creech Jones stood in Romford, but was unable to regain the constituency for Labour. In the early 1950s, Creech Jones succeeded in reconciling Seretse Khama (who had been exiled from Bechuanaland after marrying an Englishwoman) with his uncle Tshekedi, and petitioned the government to rescind the exile order. He also led delegations to the Government from the Anti-Slavery Society (of which he was Vice-President) and the Africa Bureau. He was Chairman of the British Council of Pacific Relations from 1952. Wakefield MP Creech Jones' opportunity to return to Parliament came in 1954 when Arthur Greenwood, Labour MP for Wakefield, died. He was selected in Greenwood's place, and kept the seat in the by-election. He returned to the Labour front bench, but also retained his involvement in outside work. He was appointed to the governing body of Queen Elizabeth House, a Colonial Office-sponsored institution at Oxford University, in March 1955.\\"Queen Elizabeth House\\", The Times, 23 March 1955. Despite being aged nearly 70, Creech Jones was reappointed to the opposition front bench after the 1959 general election.\\"Mr. Gaitskell Chooses Labour's Men of the Future\\", The Times, 13 November 1959. In 1961 he signed a letter expressing disquiet at a British application to join the European Communities, and urging a Commonwealth conference to discuss the implications before formally applying.\\"Majority Lean Towards Participation\\", The Times, 13 June 1961.

The ankle joint of therian mammals (marsupials and placentals) is a crurotarsal joint, with the main joint of ankle bending between the tibia and the astragalus; the calcaneum has no contact with the tibia but forms a heel to which muscles can attach. A group of archosauriform diapsids, Crurotarsi (including living crocodilians and their extinct relatives) is named after specialized crurotarsal joint in the skeletons of the members of this group, located between their fibula and calcaneum, with a hemicylindrical condyle on the calcaneum articulating against fibula. This joint is present in the skeletons of suchians (including crocodilians) and phytosaurs, and was cited as one of the characters supporting uniting these two groups in a clade to the exclusion of avemetatarsalian archosaurs (birds and their extinct relatives). However, according to a study published in 2011, suchians are more closely related to Avemetatarsalia than to phytosaurs; there is, however, not enough information to find out whether the aforementioned crurotarsal joint evolved independently in suchians and in phytosaurs, or whether it was already present in the skeleton of their most recent common ancestor (and secondarily lost in avemetatarsalians). left The ankle joint of pseudosuchians (including crocodilians) and phytosaurs, passing between the astragalus and calcaneum, is also called crurotarsal joint in the literature.Dyke G.J. & Kaiser G.W. (eds.), Living Dinosaurs: The Evolutionary History of Modern Birds, John Wiley & Sons, London, 2011, p. 406. In the skeletons of the phytosaurs and most of the pseudosuchians this joint bends around a peg on the astragalus which fits into a socket in the calcaneum (the “crocodile normal” tarsus); only in the skeletons of the ornithosuchid pseudosuchians a peg on the calcaneum fits into a socket in the astragalus (the “crocodile reversed” tarsus). Strictly speaking this ankle is not a crurotarsal joint in the previously discussed sense, as it's situated between the two proximal tarsal bones. However, while calcaneum is not fixed to the fibula, the astragalus is fixed to the tibia by a suture and thus in practice it functions as an extension of the crus.

The game was originally published by Virgin Play in Europe as one of their first published games, and was later co-published by Eidos Interactive (under the Secret Stash Games brand) and V.2 Play (being the only game Virgin Play released in North America) in North America. The game's North American box art was created by artist Arthur Suydam, famous for his work on the Marvel Zombies line of comics. Gameplay Touch the Dead is a rail shooter. Players use the stylus to point at oncoming zombies on the bottom screen. Pointing fires the weapon Steiner has equipped. Shots can be delivered to the head, arms, legs, and stomach. To reload, players must simply grab a clip icon (located in the bottom right-hand corner of the touch screen), and drag it to the bottom left hand corner which has an image of the 'magazine'. The D-pad and face buttons of the console are simply used to switch weapons. Both serve the same purpose, and work for both right-handed and left-handed players. Health and ammunition can be recovered by shooting crates and cabinets. The player also has the option of shooting switches to open doors and choose a left or right path when a fork appears. Either path chosen will still yield the same bonuses. =Weapons= *Handgun: The first weapon Steiner obtains. It is the weakest of the game's firearms, doing the least amount of damage. It does, however, have unlimited ammunition. The handgun does not allow belly shots. Steiner finds the handgun on the floor in Chapter 1. Resembles the Beretta M9/92F. *Shotgun: A standard pump-action shotgun. The shotgun is most effective at close range, and can blow off heads and stomachs. Steiner finds the shotgun in a control room in Chapter 1. Resembles the Spas 12 shotgun. *Submachine Gun: Steiner's only fully automatic weapon in the game. He obtains it while stopping in a shack, located in the swamps of Chapter 3. Resembles the MP5 type K. *Crowbar: Steiner's only melee weapon, also used to break down certain doors. Steiner gets it from the boss of Chapter 2. Resembles a crowbar. Storyline Protagonist Rob Steiner, or Prisoner #1809, has been transferred to Ashdown Hole State Penitentiary. Steiner has been accused of and sentenced for a murder that he did not commit. The intro movie shows him being transferred, and his mugshots. Resting in his cell, Steiner's cell door opens. Seeing his chance for escape, Steiner flees his cell into the Penitentiary, which is mysteriously occupied by zombies. By the game's end, Steiner has gone through the entire prison, the sewer system, the prison hospital, and the rooftops of the prison. Steiner eventually escapes, but realizes that there is much more to go. He finds an airboat that he uses to dredge through a thick swamp, until he eventually comes to an abandoned military base. Steiner fights his way through the zombie-infested base, and is ultimately rescued via helicopter. It is also implied, though not mentioned directly that Steiner was placed there on purpose by the military or whoever it was that rescued him. The moment Steiner is saved, one of the men tells him that they did not believe he would make it out and that Steiner is more dangerous then they had previously thought. It ends with Steiner being placed in handcuffs and the choppers leaving what appears to be an island. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was heavily criticized for its \\"blocky\\" graphics and repetitive sound; however, it received great appreciation for its innovative gameplay which makes excellent use of the touch screen. Most complaints stemmed from its reloading system which requires the player to move a magazine from one side of the screen to the other to reload, wasting precious seconds in an already difficult game. IGN cited its mediocre graphics and poor originality. GameSpot also criticized the graphics, but still appreciated its original gameplay.

Early days Engel first joined General Motors as a student under Harley Earl's watchful eye at GM's school of design. In 1939 he met classmates Joe Oros and George W. Walker at the school. During World War II, Engel served four years in the U.S. Army as a mapmaker, in both the European and Pacific theaters of operation. He and Oros remained in touch throughout the war, and after the war when Oros took a position in Walker's design firm, he recommended that Engel be hired as well. Although Walker's firm had Nash as an account, Engel worked on designs for farm equipment, women's shoes and household appliances. However, when Walker obtained a contract with Ford Motor Company in 1947 (and dumped Nash), Engel and Oros went to work full-time designing automobiles. Engel and Oros were such close friends that Oros was best man when Engel was wedded to Marguerite Imboden. While Oros worked under Walker on Ford car and truck designs, Engel concentrated on Lincoln and Mercury vehicles. Ford When Walker became Ford's vice president for design in 1955, he made Engel and Oros his lieutenants. The trio was responsible for most of the ever-increasing sizes of Ford's late 1950s models, and their ornate chrome adornments. Engel and Oros came up with competing designs for the 1958 Thunderbird. Oros's four-seater design was ultimately chosen. Engel's team was instructed by Ford President Robert S. McNamara to add two more doors and two more seats to their roadster design - and that became the basis for the 1961 Lincoln Continental. McNamara had considered terminating the Lincoln brand, along with the Edsel, after the 1960 model year. The Continental, however, convinced him to keep the line going, and it became such a success it was credited with saving the brand. Engel also scaled down the Ford Thunderbird and turned it into a four-seater to create the 1959 Ford Anglia 105E, a popular saloon in Britain. Chrysler In 1961 Walker retired from Ford at age 65. When Eugene Bordinat, not Engel, was chosen as his replacement, the well-connected Walker helped orchestrate Engel's move to Chrysler in November 1961. At Chrysler, Engel replaced chief stylist Virgil Exner, who had designed the successful \\"Forward Look\\" models of the latter 1950s. Exner was responsible for the era of large tail fins; Engel was credited with replacing fins with a slab-sided look, reminiscent of his Lincoln Continental design. Engel generally delegated the majority of work to his design teams; he then would fine-tune the clay models with his touches. Co-workers said he had an uncanny eye for the \\"commercial viability\\" of designs. Engel oversaw the design and development of the 1963 Turbine car, of which 55 were manufactured and 50 of them road tested until 1966. The two-door model was said to strongly resemble his original two-door design for the 1958 Thunderbird, which had evolved into the '61 Continental. Although most of Chrysler's legendary \\"Muscle Cars\\" were credited to specific designers, Engel oversaw, worked on, and approved all of them. Retirement and death Engel retired in 1973 but stayed on at Chrysler as a consultant until 1974. Engel died of cancer on June 24, 1986.

The granite outcroppings, forming the bulk of the area, were originally formed 70 million years ago, by volcanic magma pushing up through the Earth's crust and then cooling. The current state of the rock was formed between 13,000 and 15,000 years ago by the Missoula Floods. The hills consist of small ravines, ponds, and large chunks of granite, that support an eco-system consisting mainly of ponderosa pine, as well as about 300 different flowering plants (including Indian Camas), and 73 different species of mushrooms.Plant list from the Washington Native Plant Society The area also supports wildlife, such as coyotes, marmots, white-tailed deer, pheasants, and dozens of species of butterflies. The Dishman Hills rise immediately south of the Dishman section of The City of Spokane Valley. Continuing south, out of the park, the elevation continues to rise to the Rocks of Sharon and the Iller Creek Conservation Area near the peak of Krell Hill. Valley View Fire On Thursday, July 10, 2008 at about 3:30 PM local time, the Valley View Fire started in the Dishman Hills area. As of Friday morning it burned and destroyed 11 homes. Washington State Governor Chris Gregoire declared a state of emergency for Spokane County. A mandatory evacuation was ordered in the area and two shelters were set up around Spokane Valley. The fire's origin was a smoldering fire made by a resident of South Eastern Lane. The smoldering fire had been started days before the Dishman Hills Fire, and was left unattended inside of an old tree stump before it was re-ignited by fierce winds on the afternoon of Thursday, July 11. These same winds spread the fire quickly across the Dishman Hills and threatened hundreds of homes along Dishman-Mica Road. Many homes in the Park Drive area, located between the fire's origin and the Dishman Hills Natural Area, were in the direct path of the fire. Among other things, some factors in the spread of the fire were the unprecedented wind speeds, and the amount of natural fuel in the Dishman Hills area.

This gap between the concerned group and the rest might be social, indicating poor interrelationships among each other; economical based on structural inequalities; institutional in terms of formal and specific political, occupational, educative or associative organizations and/or geographic implying regional or residential concentration. bell hooks coined the term when addressing the problem of 'hierarchy of oppression' within the feminist movement; where some felt experiencing more types of oppression gave greater validity to one's opinion and, therefore undermined group strength and solidarity within the movement as much as non-intersectional identity did in the 1970s [where female identity was seen predominantly through the lens of white, middle-class women and didn't take into consideration that identity could be made up of many more cultural influences such as race, gender, sexuality, spirituality etc. all intersecting across points of privilege and oppression]. hooks argued for greater inclusivity, mutual support and an understanding of various types of feminism within the movement; each sharing the same equity goals, yet having different ideas on the methods to achieve such goals.hooks, b.

The actual nature or phylogeny of the Vendozoan is not known, leading to form taxa only Form classification is the classification of organisms based on their morphology, which does not necessarily reflect their biological relationships. Form classification, generally restricted to palaeontology, reflects uncertainty; the goal of science is to move \\"form taxa\\" to biological taxa whose affinity is known. Form taxonomy is restricted to fossils that preserve too few characters for a conclusive taxonomic definition or assessment of their biological affinity, but whose study is made easier if a binomial name is available by which to identify them. The term \\"form classification\\" is preferred to \\"form taxonomy\\"; taxonomy suggests that the classification implies a biological affinity, whereas form classification is about giving a name to a group of morphologically-similar organisms that may not be related. A \\"parataxon\\" (not to be confused with parataxonomy), or \\"sciotaxon\\" (Gr. \\"shadow taxon\\"), is a classification based on incomplete data: for instance, the larval stage of an organism that cannot be matched up with an adult. It reflects a paucity of data that makes biological classification impossible. A sciotaxon is defined as a taxon thought to be equivalent to a true taxon (orthotaxon), but whose identity cannot be established because the two candidate taxa are preserved in different ways and thus cannot be compared directly.  Examples  = In zoology = Form taxa are groupings that are based on common overall forms. Early attempts at classification of labyrinthodonts was based on skull shape (the heavily armoured skulls often being the only preserved part). The amount of convergent evolution in the many groups lead to a number of polyphyletic taxa.Watson, D. M. S. (1920): The Structure, Evolution and Origin of the Amphibia. The \\"Orders' Rachitomi and Stereospondyli. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, (series B), Vol. 209, pp. 1–73 Article from JSTOR Such groups are united by a common mode of life, often one that is generalist, in consequence acquiring generally similar body shapes by convergent evolution. Ediacaran biota — whether they are the precursors of the Cambrian explosion of the fossil record, or are unrelated to any modern phylum — can currently only be grouped in \\"form taxa\\". Other examples include the seabirds and the \\"Graculavidae\\". The latter were initially described as the earliest family of Neornithes but are nowadays recognized to unite a number of unrelated early neornithine lineages, several of which probably later gave rise to the \\"seabird\\" form taxon of today. Fossil eggs are classified according to the parataxonomic system called Veterovata. There are three broad categories in the scheme, on the pattern of organismal phylogenetic classification, called oofamilies, oogenera and oospecies (collectively known as ootaxa). The names of oogenera and oofamilies conventionally contain the root \\"oolithus\\" meaning \\"stone egg\\", but this rule is not always followed. They are divided up into several basic types: Testudoid, Geckoid, Crocodiloid, Dinosauroid-spherulitic, Dinosauroid-prismatic, and Ornithoid. = In botany = In paleobotany, two terms were formerly used in the codes of nomenclature, \\"form genera\\" and \\"organ genera\\", to mean groups of fossils of a particular part of a plant, such as a leaf or seed, whose parent plant is not known because the fossils were preserved unattached to the parent plant. Article 1.2 A later term \\"morphotaxa\\" also allows for differences in preservational state. These three terms have been replaced as of 2011 by provisions for \\"fossil-taxa\\" that are more similar to the provisions for other types of plants. Article 1.2 Names given to organ genera could only be applied to the organs in question, and could not be extended to the entire organism. Fossil-taxon names can cover several parts of an organism, or several preservational states, but do not compete for priority with any names for the same organism that are based on a non-fossil type. The part of the plant was often, but not universally, indicated by the use of a suffix in the generic name: *wood fossils may have generic names ending in -xylon *leaf fossils generic names ending in -phyllum *fruit fossils generic names ending in -carpon, -carpum or -carpus *pollen fossils generic names ending in -pollis or -pollenoides.  Casual use  \\"Form taxon\\" can more casually be used to describe a wastebasket taxon: either a taxon that is not a natural (monophyletic) group but united by shared plesiomorphies, or a presumably artificial group of organisms whose true relationships are not known, being obscured by ecomorphological similarity. Well-known form taxa of this kind include \\"ducks\\", \\"fish\\", \\"reptiles\\" and \\"worms\\".

The recipient of the call typically hears random background noise when answering the phone. If the caller remains unaware, the recipient will sometimes overhear whatever is happening in the caller's vicinity. A pocket-dialed call can continue for many minutes, or until the recipient's voice mail system ends the call. The phrase \\"pocket dial\\" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in August 2015.  Causes  Modern cellphones come in three configurations: \\"flip\\" phones, where the phone is physically closed rendering the keys inaccessible, touch phones where a finger or stylus is required to use the controls, and open phones, where keys or buttons are always exposed. Pocket dialing primarily occurs with touch phones and open phones. Typically, a call is caused by the person's movement changing the shape of the pocket in a person's clothing in such a way that a small amount of pressure is applied to some of the buttons, or in the case of a touch screen phone, a call can also be caused by the screen of the phone facing the person's body and a small amount of perspiration creating sufficient conduction through their clothing such that the capacitive touch screen detects their clothing as if it were a touch from the user's finger. The keypad lock feature found on most mobile phones is intended to help prevent accidental dialing, but is often so trivial that the keypad is easily pocket-unlocked. Sometimes the unlock sequence requires nothing more than pressing a button and then applying a random swiping motion to the screen, or in the case of some keypad phones, it sometimes requires nothing more than holding a particular key for several seconds.  Consequences  In addition to the inconvenience and embarrassment that may result from an erroneously dialed number, the phenomenon can have other consequences including using up a phone user's airtime minutes. Accidental calls, if not hung up immediately, tie up the recipient's phone line. If this is a landline, the recipient may have difficulty in disconnecting the call in order to use the phone, as networks sometimes define a timeout period between the recipient hanging up and the call actually being cleared. Accidental calls are often cited as being one of the more annoying consequences of cell phone usage. Given the haphazard nature of inadvertent dialing, most actual misconnections do not result from the selection of random numbers. Instead, pocket dialing frequently triggers the \\"recently dialed\\" and \\"contact\\" lists that are contained within modern cell phones. The caller is frequently unaware that the call has taken place, whereas the recipient of the call often hears background conversation and background noises such as the rustling of clothes. Due to the dialing of common numbers, the recipient is likely to know the caller, and may overhear conversations that the caller would not want them to hear. In 2013, an Arkansas man, who allegedly hatched an elaborate plan to murder a former employee, was arrested after he reportedly pocket dialed the victim and revealed the plot. Investigator Joseph Morgan, a law enforcement officer with the Nevada Taxicab Authority which regulates the taxicabs in Clark County, Nevada is being prosecuted by the Nevada Attorney General's Office for leaking the contents of a pocket dial. Nevada Taxicab Authority Chief Investigator Ruben V. Aquino, Jr. pocket dialed Morgan. Aquino was then heard inappropriately discussing information relating to a confidential internal investigation. Aquino and another Investigator, Antoine \\"Chris\\" Rivers, then further discussed how the taxicab companies in Las Vegas control the day-to- day operations of the Nevada Taxicab Authority. Aquino also criticized Morgan for being proactive in his duty performance. Morgan, acting as a whistleblower, leaked the information to Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez-Masto, members of the Nevada Legislature and the media. Instead of investigating the Nevada Taxicab Authority for corruption, Morgan is being prosecuted for leaking this information. This might be the first and only occurrence of an individual being prosecuted for listening to or leaking the contents of a pocket dial. = Accidental calling of emergency services = Operators of emergency services telephone numbers, such as 911 and 999, report receiving many false alarms that are likely a result of pocket dialing. These nuisance calls can result in a drain on operators' time, particularly during summer months, which is possibly due to an increase in roller-coaster ridership. As many as 50% of emergency calls may be accidental calls.Reid J. Epstein, \\"Cell calls to 911 often made in error\\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Feb. 22, 2004 On many older phones in the United States, pushing and holding down the number '9' key will cause the phone to automatically dial 911. In many regions, the operators must spend time and resources to determine whether the call is real or accidental.FCC Consumer Advisory, November 29, 2006 The phone calls often sound similar to the sorts of struggles people have while being involved in an actual emergency. In 2014, a 9-1-1 operator in Florida received an accidental call from a meth lab in Volusia County, leading to the arrest of the three occupants for manufacturing and possessing methamphetamine. Many mobile phones will allow calling of the emergency number even when the keypad is locked, which poses a particular problem if the number is easy to dial accidentally (e.g. 999, 000). Accidental emergency calls are even more likely if the user has programmed the emergency number into the phone's contacts or speed dial.King County Press Release, \\"Sims asks for help to prevent accidental wireless 9-1-1 calls\\" April 7, 2003 To make matters worse, some phones make it easier to call the emergency services when the keypad is locked than it would be otherwise. An example of this is a soft key programmed to make an emergency call when the keylock is set. On touch-screen phones, passcode screens often include a single button that, when touched for just a few seconds, will dial emergency services. The result is that it is often preferable to disable the passcode since, while doing so increases the likelihood of pocket dialing family and friends, it is considered a lesser evil than pocket dialing the emergency services. In the UK, calls to the emergency number 999 are generally assumed to be accidental if the caller does not speak and there are no suspicious sounds. However, occasionally such 'silent' calls are genuine because the caller is unable or afraid to speak. Police advice is for the caller to then dial 55 to indicate to the operator that the call is genuine.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/22/silent-solution-emergency- calls-should-reviewed-murder- victims/https://www.westyorkshire.police.uk/contact-us/what-happens-when-you- dial-999/silent-999-calls  Solutions  =Hardware= A 2009 mobile phone advertising campaign by T-MobileDispatch Magazine Online touted their phones' resistance to inadvertent pocket dialing as being an advantage of certain flip phone models available at the time—specifically the Blackberry Pearl Flip. =Software= For Android phones, there exist apps that reduce the risk of pocket dialing.What You Should Know About Pocket Dialing by AEYNE SCHRIBER. Newer versions of Android retain the 'Emergency call' facility on the lock screen; however, they require the user to key in the emergency telephone number in order to proceed with the call, thereby making an accidental emergency call less likely than in earlier Android versions.

In the case the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg condemned Moscow City Government's refusal to consider the Church of Scientology of Moscow for registration as a religious organisation,European Court of Human Rights first section Judgment on Application no. 18147/02 by CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY OF MOSCOW against Russia (18 April 2007). Court press release here. Retrieved 2007-04-18. and as a result found that Russia had violated the rights of the Church of Scientology under Articles 11 (the right to freedom of association) when \\"read in the light of Article 9\\" (the right to freedom of religion). Specifically, the Court determined that, in denying consideration of registration to the Church of Scientology of Moscow, the Moscow authorities \\"did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality vis-à-vis the applicant's religious community\\". The Court also awarded the Church €10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and €15,000 for costs and expenses. Facts The Church of Scientology of Moscow describes itself as a religious association and was officially registered as such in January 1994. On 1 October 1997, a new Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations (Religion Law) entered into force, requiring all religious associations previously granted the status of a legal entity to bring their articles of association into conformity with the Religion Law and to re-apply for registration with the competent Justice Department before 31 December 2000. Failure to obtain \\"re-registration\\" before the expiration of that time limit exposed the Church to the threat of dissolution by judicial decision. The Church of Scientology of Moscow subsequently applied eleven times for re-registration to the Moscow Justice Department between August 1998 and May 2005. Each application was rejected. The first two applications were refused on the grounds that the Church had violated unspecified laws. The third to fifth applications were refused on the grounds that the Church had failed to submit unspecified documents. The sixth to tenth applications were refused on the grounds that the Church had failed to comply with the time limit for re-registration, although the Constitutional Court had already held that this reason was not valid. Finally, the eleventh application was refused on the ground that the Church had failed to prove its existence in Moscow for at least 15 years, although the Constitutional Court had already held that this reason was not valid. The refusal to re-register the Moscow Church under the Religion Law placed its status as a legal entity in jeopardy. The consequences of non-registration as a religious organization within the meaning of the Law were extreme for the Church and its members. As a result of the arbitrary refusal to re-register, the rights of the Church and its parishioners essential to the conduct of their religious activities on anything but the most primitive level were seriously jeopardized, including the ability to own and operate educational institutions including theological schools, to own and maintain religious buildings, to conduct charitable activities, the right to acquire, import and distribute religious literature and the right to invite foreign citizens to preach and conduct religious services. As a result of a complaint filed by the Church, the Nikulinskiy District Court of Moscow found, on 8 December 2000, that the Justice’s Department refusal to re-register the Church was unlawful. It concluded that the Justice Department had, in essence, used subterfuge to avoid re- registration of the Church and pointed out that an association with no status as a legal entity was, in particular, prevented from renting premises for religious ceremonies and worship, receiving and disseminating religious literature or holding a bank account. It also held that that refusal had been inconsistent with international standards of law. That decision became binding and enforceable on 19 December 2000. However, the Justice Department refused to comply with it and, in March 2001, it was quashed by way of supervisory review by the government. Subsequently, the Russian courts upheld the systematic refusal to register the Moscow Church. The Church then filed an application with the European Court in 2002. Judgment In its decision overturning the refusal by Russian authorities to re-register the Church, the Human Rights Court determined that the Church of Scientology of Moscow was a \\"religious community\\" entitled to the rights afforded such communities by ECHR Article 9, which protects the right to freedom of religion or belief. The Court held that where the organization of a religious community is at issue, \\"a refusal to recognize it\\" not only constitutes interference with its right to freedom of association protected by ECHR Article 11. It also constitutes interference with the applicants' right to freedom of religion under Article 9 of the Convention. The Court noted that \\"the believers' right to freedom of religion encompasses the expectation that the community will be allowed to function peacefully, free from arbitrary State intervention\\". Therefore, the Court determined that the failure to recognize the Church of Scientology through rejection of registration offended these fundamental religious freedom and association rights. Significance This expansive approach is consistent with the Court’s application of a fundamental human rights policy of the Council of Europe to religious freedom issues – \\"the need to secure true religious pluralism, an inherent feature of the notion of a democratic society\\".Manoussakis. Others v. Greece, (59/1995/565/651) (26 September 1996), paragraph 44 Similarly, the Court has emphasized the importance of \\"pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no democratic society\\".Manoussakis, Others v. Greece, (59/1995/565/651) (26 September 1996), paragraph 41 As the Court has stressed, The Court then dismissed the government's claims that the refusal to register the Moscow Church of Scientology did not constitute a violation of the Church's fundamental human rights as it was not dissolved and could continue to operate. Instead, the Court applied its findings in Moscow Branch of The Salvation Army v. Russia caseCASE OF THE MOSCOW BRANCH OF THE SALVATION ARMY v. RUSSIA (Application no. 72881/01), JUDGMENT, 5 October 2006 to find that the Moscow Church of Scientology was being prevented from exercising its full range of religious activities. Likewise, the Court found that the government's actions constituted an interference with the Church of Scientology's rights to freedom of association and religion. The Court then concluded by stating that This is not the first time that the Strasbourg organs have ruled in favor of Scientology. The Church of Scientology has previously been before the European Commission on Human Rights in a case that decided that a Church could represent its members to assert their religious rights under Article 9 (see X and Church of Scientology v. Sweden 16 DR 109 [Ecom HR 1979]).Case Summary at Minority Rights Group Int. The Commission concluded that the Church of Scientology, as \\"a Church body is capable of possessing and exercising the rights contained in Article 9(1) in its own capacity as a representative of its members.\\" Moreover, on 9 June 2005, the European Court of Human Rights (First Section) issued an important admissibility decision concerning issues relating to the registration of two Scientology Churches as a religious organization under Russian national law. In that case, Kimlya, Aidar Sultanov and Church of Scientology of Nizhnekamsk vs Russia (Application nos. 76836/01 and 32782/03),Judgement at European Center for Law and Justice the Court considered separate applications regarding the refusal of Russian authorities to register Scientology Churches as religious organizations filed by founding members of two Churches of Scientology, the Church of Scientology of Surgut City in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Region of the Russian Federation, and the Church of Scientology of Nizhnekamsk in the Tatarstan Republic of the Russian Federation. In its admissibility decision, the European Court of Human Rights determined, after examining extensive submissions and arguments by the parties, that the founding members' and the Church's complaint regarding the refusal of Russian authorities to re-register it was admissible. In September 2009, the European Court of Human Rights issued a binding ruling in favor of the Scientology branches in Surgut and Nizhnekamsk. The two organizations were awarded €20,000 in costs and damages. The ruling, which cannot be appealed, said that Russia could not ban the Church of Scientology simply because it did not have a long history in the country. The Scientology Working Group of the City of Hamburg posted comments on the city's website, in English, containing its assessment of the judgment and its implications. The Working group commented, \\"The ECHR itself did not consider whether the Scientology organisation as such meets the characteristics of a religion (or religious community) within the meaning of article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights in terms of its structure and beliefs. The Court based its ruling merely on the specifically Russian and consequently national assessment of the 'Church of Scientology Moscow' being an association of a religious nature, without positively according the Scientology organisation as a whole the status of a religious community.\\" The task force concluded that the ECHR did not grant the Church a \\"positive entitlement\\" to registration as a religious entity in Russia nor did it make a ruling on the religious nature of Scientology that would be binding on ECHR signatories other than Russia. In view of the judgment the European Human Rights Office of the Church of Scientology International emphasized a \\"need for dialogue\\" with governments.\\"Submission to OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting\\", Sept 26, 2007, page 2, by Fabio Amicarelli, OSCE homepage See also *Scientology status by country Notes References * External links * European Court of Human Rights - Official website * European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms * Scientologists set for heavenly tax cut, The Argus (UK), 11 April 2007 * Beliefnet: European Court Clears Hurdles for Scientologists *Press release of the Court (english) * German translation of court press release, convenience link at Church of Scientology Germany Human Rights Office * Church of Scientology Moscow Category:Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights Category:European Court of Human Rights cases involving Russia Category:Religion in Russia Category:Scientology litigation ","title":"Church of Scientology Moscow v.

Producers in less developed countries operate in positions within a production chain which add less value to final product. Their challenge is to \\"climb upwards\\" on the transnational production chain. Production chains are often vertical hierarchies in which big multinational companies may be those who sell final products and set production standards for \\"lesser\\" producers. This kind of fragmentation is an important part of contemporary globalisation. The United States Government Accountability Office defines fragmentation as \\"work [where] different parts of the same goal ... are broken out across different parts of the same agency.Government Accountability Office, Saving Dollar Bills: Reducing Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication in Federal Programs, 26 April 2018, accessed 2 March 2019 References Category:Production economics ","title":"Fragmentation (economics)"},{"id":"10761818","text":"The Best of TV Quiz & Game Show Themes was the 2000 follow-up to the bestselling Classic TV Game Show Themes CD, released by Varèse Sarabande.
